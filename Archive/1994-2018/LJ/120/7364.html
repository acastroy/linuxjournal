Back in November 2003, Doc Searls posted a short piece on the
<i  >LJ</i> site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7239" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7239</a>) that outlined which presidential
campaign Web sites were using open-source components. This seems
particularly relevant given the significance of the Internet to the 2004
presidential race. As Howard Dean's early campaign demonstrated, making
the Internet key to an organization can turn a lot of separate
grassroots initiatives into a large and powerful networked movement.
</p><p>
By the time you read this month's On the Web, we'll know who the
2004 Democratic presidential candidate is. Although this is a
big story, Doc continues to be interested in the story behind the
story&mdash;how the campaigns are adopting and
adapting open-source philosophy and technology. He describes his mission
as learning:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
what IT workers in the pressure-cooker conditions of political campaigns
might teach IT professionals everywhere about the resourceful use of Linux,
free software and open-source development methods. What works best? What
doesn't work at all? How do you develop and apply solutions to problems
all over the country with widely varying participants and circumstances?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Prior to LinuxWorld New York in January 2004, Doc traveled to the
Vermont headquarters of the Dean campaign. As he writes in &ldquo;Lessons from
the Campaign Pressure Cooker&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7372" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7372</a>), he
encountered both open-source software and what former Dean Campaign
Manager Joe Trippi called &ldquo;open-source politics&rdquo;. Joe used to work for
Ian Murdock, cofounder of Debian. Essentially, the Dean
campaign used its extensive grassroots support to create its own networked
market. How far this market takes Dean is unknown right now, but its success
in 2003 seems to indicate that a new phase of electoral politics has begun.
</p><p>
Perhaps this shift in the campaign landscape is connected to the shift
taking place in the larger realm of supply and demand. In &ldquo;The
New Economy Hack: Turning Consumers into Producers&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7345" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7345</a>), Doc discusses how
&ldquo;consumerism is a red herring....It isn't about what you and
I invent and contribute to the marketplace. It's about what Sony
and Panasonic and Nikon and Canon produce and distribute through
retailers for us, the mass market, to consume constantly.&rdquo; Some
new computer technologies and the overall continuing drop in cost of
computer equipment, however, are allowing users to have more control
over what they create and use in their daily lives. Doc traces all this
back to the Linux economy hack, &ldquo;because Linux is something that
happened when demand started to supply itself&rdquo;.  </p><p>
Whether looking at political campaigns and the importance of the
Internet, media coverage and the rise of the blog or consumer
electronics and the increasing availability of software that lets
users make their own music, it's clear that the
do-it-yourself freedom at the heart of open source is spreading. If
