You want to record a simple voice message on your Linux system. It seems
like an easy enough thing&mdash;until you need a certain audio format, 
complex edits, special effects and other audio tweaks. However,
it's still pretty easy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1412580.0x150a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That must be the 30th time I've heard you repeat that phrase,
Fran&ccedil;ois. What are you doing? Trying to record a new voice message
for our Asterisk Linux-based answering machine? But you keep
repeating yourself. Don't you like any of the recordings you've
made so far? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> None of them have worked? Ah, here is the
problem...the microphone isn't on. Wait! I see a second, similar,
problem. Your mixer gain is set all the way down. Now try it. Much better,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Finish this later, Fran&ccedil;ois, I can see that our guests are
already arriving and we must be ready. Look sharp.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, where the best in
Linux and open-source software is paired with superb wine from around the
globe. Makes yourselves comfortable, and I will send my faithful waiter
to fetch tonight's wine selection. Fran&ccedil;ois, we have a few bottles left
of that Niagara Region 1998 Reif Estates Vidal Ice wine. Please fetch
them
from the cellar.
</p><p>
On tonight's menu, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, we will examine sound recording tools
for your Linux system. Recording audio is actually pretty simple, though
you must remember to turn up the microphone on your desktop's mixer applet
(Figure 1). Some systems, notebook computers for instance, have
multiple inputs. In addition to the internal, built-in microphone, you may
also have a jack to plug in a headset, which has its own microphone. Make
sure you select the appropriate source.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Remember to
set your microphone gain before you record.
</p></div></div><p>
Getting a sound sample is easy enough and doesn't require fancy
software. Command-line tools that are very likely already included in
your system will do the job nicely. For instance, look for a command
called arecord, which comes with a companion program called
aplay. Simply put, arecord is a sound recorder for
the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) subsystem. Here it is in
its simplest form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
arecord -d 10 myrecording.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is a WAV format file named myrecording.wav that is ten
seconds in length. The WAV format is the default, so if I hadn't given
my file an extention, the result still would have been a WAV file. Other
file formats (au, voc or raw) can be specified on the command line with
the -f option. Plenty of options let you change
the sample rate, number of channels and so on. Run the command with a
-h, or check the man page for a list of available
options. Here's another example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
arecord -d 15 -f cd secondrecording.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
The really interesting option here is <tt  >-f cd</tt>, a shortcut for
<tt  >-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100</tt>, which effectively means
16-bit, little
endian, 2-channel sound and a 44,100Hz sample rate. Then,
if you want, you can play that clip using the aplay command.
</p><p>
There are, of course, some limitations with such a simple program. For
instance, what if you want another audio format? Or, what if you want
to do some kind of special effect using that clip? This is where
another great little command-line program comes into play. It's called
sox, the SOund eXchange universal sound sample translator.
</p><p>
Let's say you want to convert an MP3 file to OGG; sox makes it easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sox audiofile.mp3 audiofile.ogg
</pre>
</p><p>
Simple, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? The sox program also has a set of effects
you can apply to your sound clip. For instance, let's do a two-second
fade in for a voice clip:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sox voicefile.ogg newfile.ogg fade 2
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, it's not difficult. To get a handle on the various
effects, type <tt  >sox --help-effects=all</tt>.
</p><p>
There are, of course, graphical tools for recording sound. For instance,
the KDE desktop's multimedia suite includes a program called KRec (Figure 2), a very capable sound recorder that takes advantage of KDE's
aRts sound system. Because of this aRts integration, make sure your aRts
d&aelig;mon is set to use full-duplex mode&mdash;you can enable this in the KDE
Control Panel, kcontrol, under the Multimedia section.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. KDE's KRec tool is surprisingly
complex under the surface, but it makes a great tool for simple audio
recordings.
</p></div></div><p>
To record a sound with KRec, start by clicking the New icon on the top
left (or click File on the menu bar and select New). Then, click
the red Record button and begin speaking into your microphone. Recording
and playback levels are displayed, as is positional information on
the raw data being recorded. At the bottom, there are a series of dials
that let you adjust the aRts compressor settings. When you have finished
recording, press the Stop button, rewind, then press Play to listen to your
clip. When you are ready to save it, you can choose to keep the raw data
or export it to a more familiar format, such as WAV, OGG or MP3. Click File
on the menu bar and select Export.
</p><p>
For GNOME desktop users, we have the GNOME sound recorder (Figure 3),
which is available from the Multimedia menu. Using that program,
you can select your input source (internal or external microphone and so
forth),
and the audio file format from the Record as drop-down box. To start
recording, click the red Record button and start talking, singing or
reciting Shakespearean poetry&mdash;whatever turns you on. When you are done,
click the Stop button (the gray square at the end of the icon bar). Then,
click the Save button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9813f3.large.jpg"><img src="9813f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The
GNOME desktop provides an easy-to-use tool for simple recordings.
</p></div></div><p>
These are all easy ways to record sound, but editing is limited. You 
have only so much control over recording quality, and anything other than the
simplest of edits can be difficult or impossible. That's where a program
like Audacity comes into play.
</p><p>
Audacity is a wonderful, easy-to-use, audio editing program. With
Audacity, you can record audio from a variety of sources, including a
microphone&mdash;podcasts, anyone? You also can use it to convert audio files
into other audio formats. Take your old records or tapes, clean up
the noise, and convert them to digital audio so you can burn them
to CD. Edit, cut, copy, mix, add special effects and splice sound
sources to create new sounds. Audacity is a multitrack real-time audio
editing system that can handle 16-, 24- and 32-bit samples. Audacity is
also just plain fun. You can get a copy of Audacity from your favorite
Linux distribution's repositories (or install disks), or you can visit
<a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net" target="_self">audacity.sourceforge.net</a> for the latest source. In the following
examples, I am using version 1.3.3 beta.
</p><p>
Audacity starts with a blank slate by default (Figure 4). Along the
top of Audacity's main window, you will find a pretty standard menu bar with
access to various categories of tools in Audacity's toolbox. Directly
below the menu bar and toward the center, a number of buttons reflect
Audacity's audio editing nature. These buttons are Pause, Play, Stop,
Skip to Start, Skip to End and Record. I mention these first because
they are so familiar.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9813f4.large.jpg"><img src="9813f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Audacity presents a blank
slate for your creative urges.
</p></div></div><p>
To the right of those buttons is a compact toolbox with six small icons
representing some common tools used in Audacity. The vertical bar icon,
which looks like a capital I, is the Selection tool, and it is selected
by default. Now, let's record something.
</p><p>
Make sure your microphone is plugged in, and then click the Record button
to start. Be creative. Sing a short tune, recite a line or two of poetry,
or just speak whatever nonsense pops into your head.
</p><p>
As you record, keep your eye on the microphone icon near the top on the
far right. If you pause your mouse cursor over it, the tooltip reads,
&ldquo;Input level monitor - click to monitor input&rdquo;. When using a stereo input
source, you'll see both the left and right channel levels being
displayed,
as shown in Figure 5. Of course, if you are using a single-channel microphone,
you'll see only the right channel.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. While you are
recording, keep your eye on the input level meter on the top right.
</p></div></div><p>
As you record, you will see the appearance of an audio track with details about
the quality of the recording&mdash;whether it's a mono or stereo recording
and so on. When you are finished recording, click the Stop button. The
full audio track remains with timing marks above (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9813f6.large.jpg"><img src="9813f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. With a voice sample
recorded, Audacity now displays one audio track.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see from the preceding sample, I recorded a little more than six seconds
of speech. To listen to the recorded track, click the Play button (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9813f7.large.jpg"><img src="9813f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. When playing
back the sound clip, look at the meter directly to the right of the
Record button.
</p></div></div><p>
At the bottom of the screen, there are additional details on the
recorded track, the project audio rate (more on that shortly), as well
as positional information.
</p><p>
Now that you have a sound clip to work with, this is a good time to save
your work, and a good time for Fran&ccedil;ois to refill everyone's glass. While
he does so, let me tell you about exactly what you are saving. At this stage,
you do not have a finished product, but a work in progress. Audacity
calls these projects. To save your project, click File on the
menu bar and select Save Project As. A file navigation dialog appears
where you can select the folder that will house your project. Give your
project a name (I'll call mine justplaying), and then click Save.
</p><p>
When you save a project, everything having to do with your project
is saved, as it is at that moment. The only thing to remember is that
Audacity project files (with an .aup extension) cannot be opened by other
packages. The AUP file is accompanied by another folder of the same name,
but with a _data extension. Now that your project is safe and sound,
let's do some edits on that file.
</p><p>
Basic audio editing consists of identifying a section of track, selecting
that section and performing some action on that section. Notice the
first second or so of my recorded sample in the close-up in Figure 8. Yes,
it's the dreaded dead air, the mini-uhm we tend to sneak in at the
beginning of these things. I got lucky with that small pause, but it can
often be a lot worse. Click the beginning of the sample at the zero mark,
and drag the mouse pointer to select that pause.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The first second
of dead air in my recording is selected in preparation for trimming.
</p></div></div><p>
After you've selected the section of audio that contains the dead air,
click the Play button to make sure that you haven't selected a portion of
your speech. If necessary, adjust the selected area by positioning your
mouse cursor over the beginning or end of the selected area and dragging
to the left or right. The cursor changes to a hand with a pointing
finger. If you are satisfied with your selection, click Edit on the
menu bar and select Cut (you also can press the Delete key). Now,
click the Play button again to listen to your file without that little
bit of dead air. If you make a mistake, you can undo the changes by
pressing Ctrl-Z.
</p><p>
With Audacity, you can let your creativity run wild with tons of included
effects. Let's say, for example, you want to fade out the last
few seconds of your recording. Select that section of the audio track,
play it first to confirm you have what you want, and then click Effect
and select Fade Out.
</p><p>
Perhaps you need to emphasize a few words. Again, select the section of
audio you want, click Effect, and select Amplify. In the dialog
that appears (Figure 9), amplify your selection by using the slider
for a decibel increase. For finer control, simply type the number into
the Amplification (dB) field. I should point out that despite the
name, Amplify, you can enter a negative amplification to reduce the
volume. Click the Preview button to sample the effect before you click OK.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Despite the name,
Amplify, this dialog can be used to decrease the volume as well.
</p></div></div><p>
Sometimes, repetition is the best way to get your point across. Make
your selection, click Effect on the menu bar, and select Repeat. The
default is to repeat the selected audio ten times, but you can override
that in the dialog (Figure 10). This repeat effect can be a lot of fun if
you select a very short segment (or a single word) and set it to repeat
for several beats.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9813f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The repeat effect
identifies the length of the segment and then asks how many times you
want that segment repeated.
</p></div></div><p>
I highly recommend that you spend some time playing with the
effects&mdash;there
are plenty of them. Aside from being a great way to waste time,
you'll be impressed with the arsenal of effects at your disposal. Change
your pitch (without changing tempo), change the tempo, equalize soft and
loud portions of your audio, add tremolo, remove noise and more. The
latest version of Audacity also has tons of additional plugins (under
the Effects menu) to keep you entertained.
</p><p>
Okay, I want to cover one last effect, which I'll call &ldquo;Nostalgia Time
at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>&rdquo;. One of my favorite effects is something those of us
who can still remember vinyl albums will appreciate. On the occasional
album, there were sections of a recording where you could play the sound
backward to reveal a secret message. Granted, some of these so-called
hidden messages were imagined, and playing your album backward did nothing
but add wear and tear to your needle, but others really were there. Well,
you can create your own hidden message by using the Reverse effect.
</p><p>
So, where do you go from here? You've created some cool sound samples,
played with them, cut and trimmed them, amplified here, reverbed there,
changed pitch and tempo, and otherwise created something totally new
from what started out as a simple voice clip. What else is there? One
option is to create your own podcasts, and I mention this mostly to bring
up this point. When you are finished with your masterpiece, you want to
save that file in a format that your listeners can use&mdash;that might be
MP3, OGG, WAV or something else. Remember, up to this point, you are
dealing with Audacity project files only. Click File on the menu bar
and select Export. The Export File dialog appears (Figure 11)
from which you can select a filename, location and type.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9813f11.large.jpg"><img src="9813f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. You can export
(or save) your audio creation in a variety of formats, including MP3.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> That clock on the wall cannot be right! Can it already
be closing time? Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I fear it may indeed be
correct. Perhaps we can convince Fran&ccedil;ois to refill everyone's glass one
final time before we must all head out into the open night. Raise your
glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
