Michele Davis and Jon Phillips' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning PHP &amp;
MySQL</em></span>, 2nd Edition
(O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
In our enlightened community, PHP and MySQL are becoming the typical tag
team for developing database-driven Web development. If this is your
calling, pick up the new 2nd edition of Davis and Phillips' book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning PHP and MySQL</em></span>, published by O'Reilly. Intended for newcomers to
the technologies, the book teaches both the PHP language and the MySQL
database separately and then shows how to merge the two to generate
dynamic content. It also contains content on XHTML, error handling,
security, HTTP authentication and more.

AML's MT7570 Vehicle Mount Terminal</h2></div></div><p>
If your forklift needs a Linux-driven data-capture device, AML
hopes you'll use its new MT7570 vehicle mount terminal. The MT7570
is designed for &ldquo;real-time receiving, put-away, picking and shipping
applications in harsh industrial environments&rdquo;, and it integrates securely
into existing wireless networks. Full USB and RS-232 serial connections,
as well as optional Bluetooth WPAN communications, provide connectivity to
peripheral devices, such as bar-code scanners and printers. Construction
is rugged. The MT7570 has a bright display for dimly lit environments
and can withstand dust and water deluges. The device is available with
either embedded Linux or Windows XPe, and both systems include terminal
emulators (VT100/220, TN5250, TN3270), Web browsers and a Skype client.

Silicon Mechanics' Bladeform 8100 Series Blade Server Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Silicon Mechanics recently rolled out its new Bladeform 8100 Series

computing challenges by allowing multiple servers to be contained within
one easy-to-manage system.&rdquo; Series components include the blade server
enclosure, the 8110 server blade (dual Intel Xeon), modular networking
and interconnect components. Some of the key features include a
modular enclosure with support for up to ten server blades, up to four
redundant load-balancing power modules, 90%+ efficient power supplies,
up to 2GB Ethernet switches with ten external ports each, InfiniBand
expansion adapters and switch support, and remote management capabilities.

Integrated Computer Solutions' UIM/X</h2></div></div><p>
We bid a warm Linux-community welcome to Integrated Computer Solutions,
which recently released version 3.1.1 of UIM/X, a client/server
application-development tool that now also runs on Linux. UIM/X enables
developers to build Motif GUIs &ldquo;in a fraction of the time it takes by
hand&rdquo;, say the folks at Integrated. They also claim that UIM enhances
programmer productivity by enabling the creation, modification, testing
and code generation for the user interface portion of an application
with a single tool. UIM/X supports the most current version of Motif
(2.x) and runs on Solaris, HP-UX and Red Hat Linux.

Black Duck's ProtexIP</h2></div></div><p>
At LinuxWorld San Francisco, Black Duck Software announced version 4.4
of the firm's protexIP/development, &ldquo;a platform that helps companies
govern how their software assets are created, managed and
licensed.&rdquo;
ProtexIP helps developers and legal counsel in managing the use of code
from open-source projects that have both decided to switch
to GPLv3 explicitly and those that have decided not to switch. It also includes
an enhanced KnowledgeBase, a library of open-source and vendor-added
code software components that includes detailed licensing information
for more than 140,000 components.

Storix, Inc.'s SBAdmin</h2></div></div><p>
In other news from LinuxWorld, Storix, Inc., released SBAdmin v6.2, touted
as the first backup and system recovery solution to integrate with IBM's
Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM). SBAdmin complements TSM by expanding on
its features and capabilities for Linux and AIX systems. SBAdmin also
writes directly to the TSM server, which cuts extraneous steps, saves
time and increases reliability. In addition, the application provides
TSM users with disaster-recover capabilities, including a feature called
Adaptable System Recovery, which enables system restore to the same or
dissimilar hardware.

64 Studio</h2></div></div><p>
Although I fear Dave Phillips will scoop me on his &ldquo;Studio
Dave&rdquo; blog, let
it be known that 64 Studio 2.0 Electric has been released. 64 Studio
is &ldquo;a GNU/Linux distribution tailor-made for digital content creation,
including audio, video, graphics and publishing tools.&rdquo; A remix of
Debian, 64 Studio comes in both 64- and 32-bit flavors, allowing it
to run on nearly all PC hardware. The distro combines the stability and
quality of Debian Etch with a specialized real-time preemption kernel and
the latest creative tools demanded by multimedia artists. The developers
aim to rocket you from blank hard drive to a fully hardware-optimized
and usable creative desktop in just half an hour.
