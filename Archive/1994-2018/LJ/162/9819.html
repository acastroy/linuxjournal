Many a tear has to fall, but it's all in the game.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x201d580.0x21154a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We seem to spend a lot of time talking about games and how to program them
as shell scripts, don't we? From <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span>, we're in danger of
having to rename this column &ldquo;game programming in the
shell&rdquo;. But, that'd
be crazy; who in the heck would write multiple games as shell scripts? 
</p><p>
So, this month, I thought it would be fun to look at a dice game and
see how the basic set of playing card functions we've written previously
compare to the necessary functions to play a dice game.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span> was first introduced by Hasbro in 1956 as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Yacht</em></span> (having been
invented by a wealthy couple on their fancy boat) and has been one of
its best-selling titles since, spawning many variants,
including hand-held electronic games and more. At its heart though,
it's basically five-card draw poker played with dice. The wrinkle is that
there are a set number of possible hands you can roll, and you attempt
to achieve them all to maximize your score.
</p><p>
For example, roll a 3 4 4 4 5, and you might well pick up the 3 and the 5,
hoping for either &ldquo;your fours&rdquo; (which you can get only once and want to
choose when you have the maximum number of fours showing), or if you get
five of a kind, a &ldquo;Yahtzee&rdquo;, which is a big-points bonus but obviously
difficult to achieve.
</p><p>
Like five-card draw, you can pick up zero to five dice and reroll
them, but unlike five-card draw, you can do this twice on your turn,
not once. So, perhaps the 3 4 4 4 5 rerolls as a 1 4 4 4 4. The second
roll would then be to reroll the one and hope for another four. Either way,
it's a good roll (unless you've already marked your fours).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x201d580.0x2115a80"></a>
Modeling It All</h2></div></div><p>
Dice are quite easy to create in a script&mdash;so easy it reveals how
straightforward a script like liar's dice would be to write:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function rollDie()
{

    dieroll=$(( ( $RANDOM % 6 ) + 1 ))
}
</pre>
</p><p>
If it's this easy to roll a die, though (dice, by the way, is plural of
die), it'd be darn easy to write a quick <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dungeons and
Dragons</em></span> dice
roller too, as shown:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function rollDie()
{
    sides=${1:-6}

    echo "testing with a $sides-sided die...."

    dieroll=$(( ( $RANDOM % $sides ) + 1 ))
}
</pre>
</p><p>
All you need to do is call rollDie with the number of sides you want on
the dice it needs to roll. Using a 20-sided die? Try <tt  >rollDie
20</tt> to see
what rolls.
</p><p>
This also can quickly and easily be converted into a command-line
function, so you could be a real <span   class="emphasis"><em>D&amp;D</em></span> nerd by having a laptop adjacent and
typing in <tt  >roll 20</tt> every time you're actually supposed to roll the die.
</p><p>
But back to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span>, yes? The easy part of modeling the game is the dice
rolls. We need to have five dice, and that easily can be done with an array:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rollDie ; dice[0]=$dieroll
rollDie ; dice[1]=$dieroll
rollDie ; dice[2]=$dieroll
rollDie ; dice[3]=$dieroll
rollDie ; dice[4]=$dieroll
</pre>
</p><p>
There, that's your first roll of the five dice. Displaying the results
also is easy:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "You rolled " ${dice[0]} ${dice[1]} ${dice[2]} ${dice[3]} ${dice[4]}
</pre>
</p><p>
Note carefully where I do and don't need to use the curly braces to get
the array to work properly in the shell. Try this to see how it differs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "You rolled " $dice[0] $dice[1]
</pre>
</p><p>
Quite different results, as you can see. (And, as usual with shell
programming, there's no useful warnings or error messages to clue you in
to what might be wrong.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x201d580.0x2116210"></a>
Rerolling Specific Dice</h2></div></div><p>
Rolling the dice to get an initial hand is pretty straightforward,
so let's take the next step and write the code to let you reroll
any or all of the five dice twice to get your final hand.
</p><p>
There are a number of ways to ask for this sort of input, but to make it
a bit chatty, let's simply present each die in ordinal value and let the
player enter the appropriate number to indicate that it should be rerolled.
Um, let me show you what I mean:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "Reroll which dice? "

read answer
for reroll in $answer
do
  echo "Requested: $reroll"
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, you might specify that you want die 1 and 3 rerolled by typing in
<tt  >1 3</tt>. Tweaking this just a bit, the for loop then can test for the
validity of each entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for reroll in $answer
do
  if [ $reroll -lt 1 -o $reroll -gt 5 ] ; then
    echo "Invalid entry: $reroll. Please enter 1-5"
  else
    echo "Requested: $reroll"
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, of course, it's time for some actual logic here, not merely a
rudimentary test. I've simplified things just a wee bit by using array
indices 1&ndash;5 rather than 0&ndash;4, sacrificing the slot of entry 0 so that
it's easier to work with the values. This means if you ask to reroll
die 4, for example, it's just a reassignment of dice[4].
</p><p>
Here's the new, improved for loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for reroll in $answer
do
  if [ $reroll -lt 1 -o $reroll -gt 5 ] ; then
    echo "Invalid entry: $reroll. Please enter 1-5"
  else
    rollDie
    dice[$reroll]=$dieroll
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that it's quite simple, and if we're not afraid of the code
stretching out a bit, we simply can copy and paste some of it to show
our before and after rolls:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "Your new  roll: [${dice[1]}], "
echo -n "[${dice[2]}], [${dice[3]}], "
echo    "[${dice[4]}] and [${dice[5]}]"
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's run it once to see what's happening, and then next month, we'll
start working on the actual game itself, rather than just the dice rolls:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./yahtzee.sh
You rolled [2], [6], [5], [2] and [1]
Reroll which dice? 2 3 5
Your new  roll: [2], [2], [4], [2] and [5]
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, I snuck in the notation of having the dice values shown within
square brackets just for visual appearance. It makes the echo statements
a bit more confusing, as you can see just a bit earlier, but the output
is more attractive.
