A nicely polished Myth configuration on excellent hardware with slightly
weak HD performance.

MythTV is arguably the most popular multimedia platform for Linux. It
has excellent support for television&mdash;allowing you to pause, fast-forward and rewind live TV streams by spooling the stream temporarily
on disk. It has commercial detection, so you can skip advertising,
and it can use a variety of tuners and video input devices, including
DVB-
and ATSC-based digital tuners, as well as traditional analog tuners both with
and without hardware MPEG-2 encoders.

We tested with a Panasonic PT-AE900u 720p projector and a standard 29"
PAL television set.
</p></div><p>
It also includes a music player interface capable of ripping, encoding,
sorting and playing most popular audio formats, with nifty full-screen
visualisations. It will rip and transcode DVDs and play almost any
video format you can imagine off the hard disk.
</p><p>
One of the weaknesses of MythTV is that it's not very easy to set up and
configure; it's hours of hard work for people who know what they're
doing&mdash;vastly beyond the capabilities of average consumers.
</p><p>
myPVR, from OpenMedia
(<a href="http://openmedia.co.nz/openmedia/content/section/3/44" target="_self">openmedia.co.nz/openmedia/content/section/3/44</a>) provides a PVR
solution built on MythTV that smooths over most of the rough edges.
OpenMedia has put a lot of energy into polishing the MythTV interface, and
it shows. When requesting a unit to test, we were asked what kind of
display we'd be using, so that the profiles could be set up for us. When
it arrived, it worked straight out of the box, without any configuration
required, and all of the PVR's functionality could be accessed using
the remote control. The New Zealand TV channel listings already were set up for
us when we turned on the device.

Time from box arriving to media playing: two minutes.
</p></li><li><p>
Time from box arriving to first crash: ten minutes.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
In order to stress-test the system, we played BBC's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Planet
Earth</em></span> in
1080p H.264. It tried gamely, but we managed to crash the media player
in fairly short form. This is excusable though, as almost nothing
manages to play H.264 content well on Linux. It did, however, perform very
well on 720p HD content and SD content. The sound card was very well
isolated, with crisp sound that had almost no discernable hiss, even
when we turned up the amp as high as it would go. The box itself is a
little noisy&mdash;if you were to have it sitting across the room, it probably
wouldn't be noticeable, but behind the couch in our Official Audio/Visual
Testing Suite (er, Jes' living room), the fan noise was audible during very
quiet scenes. Still, we were very pleased with the choice of hardware.
</p><p>
Some other nice touches are a slick default theme, although it is a
little like Windows Media Center. The New Zealand channel guides were
programmed for us already, as well as little touches like the official
channel icons. The unit itself looks very appealing, with a slick black
case and muted-blue glowing LCD showing the internal temperature and
fan speed.
</p><p>
Some fun games were pre-installed, including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span>
and the XMAME emulator. The specifications claim support for USB gamepad
and joystick devices, but unfortunately, we couldn't get it to work. We
feel this is probably a make-or-break issue for gaming on the
device&mdash;if USB gamepads worked without requiring arcane
configuration, we imagine
it would be quite popular for casual gamers who were
not interested in buying a dedicated console.
</p><p>
Another excellent improvement from the default MythTV distribution is the
ability to download and apply updates to the software from OpenMedia,
using a reasonably simple update interface and a tool to configure
networking easily.

Steven Ellis from OpenMedia was kind enough to talk to us about MythTV,
his product and DRM.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH:
So, how did you get started in MythTV?
</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: I played with video codecs back in the UK as a developer, so I've always been
into that side of things. I kept an eye on Freevo and MythTV and did
test installs, but I never felt the hardware was good enough for what I
was after. Plus, one of the guys at my old job was playing around with
TiVo and MythTV, which gave me some exposure. Then, about 18 months ago,
I felt there was a good-enough hardware platform for my needs, which
eventually became myPVR 1.0.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
JH: What were the issues with the previous hardware platforms?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: Speed wasn't there to do HD, or you had to do a lot of cooling. I was
after as integrated a solution as possible, and it had to be future-proof with good composite/svideo TV out as well as DVI/HDMI support. The
NVIDIA 6150-based platform was perfect&mdash;great graphics with good drivers,
excellent TV out and all integrated into the MB.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: How do you feel about MythTV as a platform&mdash;how far it's come, and
where it's likely to go?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: The video side of it rocks, but for music, it has a long, long way to
go. People who have used other PVR software solutions are always blown away
by how quick MythTV is, but they are shocked at the MythMusic plugin. It was
okay three years ago, but it doesn't measure up against iTunes. As a
platform, it
provides an amazing base, but it is still hard for the average user to
customise, which is why OpenMedia provides myPVR fully configured. As
to where it is going, lots of interesting work in the digital TV space
is where we are playing catchup to MediaPortal. Also, there's some nice work
in the IPTV space, but we always will be hindered by the proprietary DRM
solutions on the market. Commercially, the biggest gap right now is the
lack of Blu-ray and HD-DVD support. I have to be very careful about any
statements I say, as I don't want potential customers assuming support.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: Do you think this is going to be a big issue for MythTV and myPVR?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: We have to keep up with the technologies. We showed off myPVR at
Auckland's Big Boys Toys show last year, and the feedback was awesome, but a lot
of consumers assumed it would already have HD-DVD or Blu-ray. Geeks 
usually can get by with the technology at hand.
</p><p>
I think that DRM and potential legal issues are a bigger risk to MythTV,
and myPVR. The pending changes to the New Zealand Copyright bill will make myPVR
effectively illegal.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: What changes are those?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: The law finally makes time shifting legal, which is great, but some of the
rules and provisions are simply idiotic. For example, you can time
shift only material that isn't available &ldquo;on demand&rdquo;. How are you supposed
to police that?
</p><p>
It also provides a lot more weight to the providers of DRM. They capture
most of this under TPM (Technological Protection Methods). It becomes
illegal to remove, tamper, reverse engineer or study TPM except for a
couple of exceptions. Where it really hurts is that it becomes illegal to
provide, produce or sell equipment or software capable of removing
TPM. That hits us hard, as DVD playback on Linux is effectively TPM
removal.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: Yeah, that's pretty rough.</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: Plus, we might be required to enforce the restrictions on
time shifting. For example, our units would not be allowed to keep material
for more than a reasonable amount of time, but there is no definition
of what a reasonable amount of time really is. Days, weeks, months? There
also is a provision for format shifting of audio, but not video or
pictures. Hence, we shouldn't allow our customers to copy their old VHS
tapes to HD or DVD, as that is breaking the law. They are pushing the
policing to the equipment providers.
</p><p>
Overall DRM is a potential killer for nonproprietary devices like MythTV.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: I'm assuming this is the same in the US as well?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: Consumers would love a one-device-fits-all product, but with the advent
of competing DRM systems for IPTV on top of the DRM used by traditional
pay TV companies, there is a lot of lockout. At least some of the US
cable companies provide cable boxes that do the DRM that have FireWire
connectivity for PVRs to hook into. Then, there is the DRM in the audio
space. Consumers just get annoyed when their iTunes tracks don't play
on their Zune, etc.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: It all sounds pretty bleak really for Linux PVR devices.</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: All PVR devices. Microsoft has similar issues with Media Center. But,
as shown in the UK and parts of Europe, there is a large market for FTA
(Free to Air) services. We are finally starting to transition to FTA
digital here. Thankfully, New Zealand is going for a third-generation digital terrestrial
system based off H.264 rather than the bandwidth-hungry MPEG-2 HD you get
in Australia and the US. One of the greatest strengths of MythTV is the global
development. The support for the HD tech we will use here already
has been written and tested by guys in the UK.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: Are there any good open-source alternatives to MythTV?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: MediaPortal is open source but on Windows. Some people love Freevo, but it
is more of a wrapper around existing tools, rather than an integrated
solution. The Elisa work from the Fluendo guys also is really interesting
(<a href="http://elisa.fluendo.com" target="_self">elisa.fluendo.com</a>). At the moment, their focus has been on
playback, but when they have the PVR features, it could be a real
killer app.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: So, what else would you like to share about myPVR before we wrap
this up?</b></span>
</p><p>
SE:
A couple odds and sods....
</p><p>
We try to contribute back where we can&mdash;for example, support for the
New Zealand
MHEG profile for digital interactive TV in both MythTV and the external
RedButton application. All the work has gone back to the community. It's
not a lot of code, but there was a hell of a lot of testing. Plus, we had
full support the day the Freeview network launched in New Zealand. Another area
we got involved in by accident was a user interface for a customer with
cerebral palsy
(<a href="http://www.mythtv.co.nz/mythtv/remote/remote-wide.html" target="_self">www.mythtv.co.nz/mythtv/remote/remote-wide.html</a>).
</p><p>
He can't use a normal remote control, but has a special
keyboard/mouse. With this Web remote, he can use all of the features of
his PVR.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: That's a very cool example of the flexibility of open-source
software.</b></span>
</p><p>
SE: Yeah. He helped iron out the niggles and just loves the way it
works. Finally, we were originally based on KnoppMyth, but we 
currently are collaborating with the Mythbuntu team to get some of the tricks
we've learned included in their build.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
JH: Thanks for your time.</b></span>
</p><p>
myPVR 2.0 is a pretty polished product given the limitations of the
platform. It doesn't diverge far from standard MythTV, but what it does
do is put together a solid product that saves you many hours of pain
attempting to configure it yourself. We give it a thumbs-up and look
forward to seeing how it improves with Mythbuntu.
