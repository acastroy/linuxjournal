Everything you need to know to start programming for the cool new Greenphone.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x283f2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Trolltech recently released many smartphone developers' dream
combination&mdash;the Linux-based Greenphone and its open-source Qtopia Phone SDK.
</p><p>
The Trolltech Greenphone is a full-featured tri-band GSM (900/1800/1900MHz) mobile phone with a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera. Like many
other modern smartphones, it features a QVGA touchscreen, Bluetooth,
client USB, mini-SD Flash and stereo audio connectors.
</p><p>
Under the hood, it is built around a Marvell 312MHz PXA270(ARM) processor,
runs with 64M of RAM, and has 128M of built-in Flash storage. It also
uses the same field-proven Broadcom BCM2121 GSM/GPRS baseband processor
module as the Palm Treo.
</p><p>
The Greenphone almost could be described as a sporty, Linux version
of the Palm Treo. It is much lighter, more compact and comes in any
color you want&mdash;as long as it's green!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x283f608"></a>
Introducing the Qtopia Greenphone SDK</h2></div></div><p>
The Greenphone SDK is a distribution of Qtopia Phone Edition, specially
configured for use on the Greenphone. Qtopia (formerly Qt Embedded)
inherits its API from Trolltech's flagship product Qt, a mature C++
application framework available for Linux/X11, Windows and Mac OS X.
Qtopia is specifically enhanced for embedded Linux devices, such as phones,
PDAs and appliances.
</p><p>
Qtopia is remarkably self-sufficient&mdash;sitting immediately on top of the
base operating system, it provides its own font and image rendering,
window management and input processing. Along with this sort of
behind-the-scenes stuff, Qtopia avails itself of all the rich features
of Qt's standardized access to files, networking, multithreading,
internationalization, graphics processing and, of course, GUI widgets.
</p><p>
Like its big brother, Qtopia is readily available either as a free
download to those wanting to do GPL-style open-source development
or by commercial license purchased from Trolltech.
</p><p>
Qtopia also bundles a suite of personal information management tools as
would be expected on any PDA or smartphone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x283f818"></a>
Inside the Box</h2></div></div><p>
When you open the Greenphone's box, you find everything needed to start
developing: mobile handset, power supply, USB cable, stereo headset
and a Greenphone SDK CD-ROM. This last item contains a copy of the
VMware player and a virtual machine preloaded with Debian Linux, Qt,
Qtopia, KDevelop, native development tools and a complete ARM
cross-compiling toolchain.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9756f1.large.jpg"><img src="9756f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Greenphone Package Contents
</p></div></div><p>
The only other item needed actually to go on air with your newly created
applications is a GSM subscriber identity module (SIM) card with a
currently active account.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x283fb30"></a>
What Is GSM?</h2></div></div><p>
The two most widely used standards for cellular communications are GSM and
CDMA, with GSM outnumbering CDMA worldwide by a ratio of about 1 billion
to 270 million users. Although they are as completely incompatible on
each other's networks as AM and FM radio, a normal user typically
would notice only that phone accounts on GSM phones are usually tied to the
SIM card, so changing handsets is really easy.
</p><p>
GSM currently stands for Global System for Mobile communications. It is
an open standard governed by the nonprofit European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (ETSI). GSM allows great interoperability permitting
easier international roaming. GSM's other claims to fame are higher
digital voice quality; a cheap short messaging service (SMS);
multimedia messaging service (MMS) for exchanging images, audio, video
and rich-text data; and finally, a general packet radio service (GPRS),
often used as an Internet gateway, with billing based on megabytes of
data transferred, as opposed to time spent on-line.
</p><p>
The Greenphone actually is based on two ARM RISC processors: a beefy
Marvell 312MHz PXA270 acts as the PDA part and communicates to the
ARM7-based GSM/GPRS communications controller. This controller is
effectively the heart and brain of the phone component. It also acts
like a modem and accepts GSM AT-style commands to dial, answer calls,
send or receive messages, and other activities typical of a GSM/GPRS
communications device.
</p><p>
Standard GSM modem AT commands can be sent to the phone, which
execute and then return a response code. These AT commands are analogous
to the decades-old Hayes modem commands, but instead of user using or
programming a string like &ldquo;+++ATDT16505511676&rdquo; to dial Trolltech's number 1-(650)
551-1676, we do the same sort of thing with the GSM version of the
command set, and the string looks more like
&ldquo;ATD16505511676&rdquo;.
</p><p>
There are myriad other AT commands for handling everything that the
GSM/GPRS phone unit can do. These include setting up the phone and
establishing various types of communication, such as voice calls, SMS and
MMS, and they can be used for getting information on signal strength, network
status and so forth.
</p><p>
For a comprehensive description of these standardized commands, you can download the following documents from the ETSI site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
Qtopia embeds the most commonly used of these commands into C++ class
wrappers. The on-line documentation in Qt Assistant describes how to use
and enhance these classes in the sections titled &ldquo;GSM Modem
Integration&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Modem Emulator&rdquo;.
</p><p>
For testing applications off-line, the Greenphone SDK provides a
modem emulator that allows testing software without having actually
to join a network and go on air.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x28402c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Gnokii</b></p><p>
For an excellent example of a Linux program using GSM AT command
codes, check out Gnokii&mdash;it's a great tool for learning about GSM
modems, as you actually can watch each transaction with the data sent
and received to execute commands to dial the phone, send SMS messages
and so on. It works well with most modern phones that have a serial or USB
data connector. By the time this article is printed, it might already
be running natively on the Greenphone. For complete details,

Getting Ready</h2></div></div><p>
Loading the development environment is simple&mdash;run the
installation program on Windows or Linux, respond affirmatively to the
prompts, and within a minute you will have VMware and the SDK tools,
application sources, documentation and binaries installed with an icon
on your desktop to start things up.
</p><p>
This makes life really easy for reluctant developers using MS Windows to
get into both embedded and desktop Linux and Qt application development.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, developers using the x86 version of Macintosh OS X can use the Greenphone SDK under VMware Fusion, but they need to copy over the virtual
machine's files from another installation; however, this may change by the
time this article is published.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x28406e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Tip:</b></p><p>
One technique for VM-based cross-platform development is to export your
display from the Linux VM to your host machine running an X11 server.
This might be the built-in X11 server running locally on your Linux
host, Apple's optional add-on to OS X or even Cygwin on a Windows
machine. I use screens rotated 90&deg; to allow reading many
more lines of code without scrolling, so this trick helps to leave the
VM configurations as generic as possible. GUI performance typically
is enhanced when the X server is run on the host machine due to the lowest
level rendering being shoved off as far down the pipeline as
possible&mdash;often at the display adapter's GPU. Using this method, it can almost
make Windows and OS X feel like a Linux box. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x28408f0"></a>
Getting Started Building Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Trolltech always ships its products with copious documentation and
example code demonstrating all common features, and the Greenphone
SDK is no exception. For starters, the &ldquo;Developer Quickstart
Guide&rdquo;
shows what needs to be done to build an application with a few one-liners.
</p><p>
First, we start the Qtopia emulator using the Qt Virtual Frame Buffer
and a Greenphone skin by clicking on the runqvfb icon on our desktop.
This is analogous to an X server for Qtopia, and it provides an exact
pixel-for-pixel representation of the program running on the phone.
</p><p>
Then, we start the Qtopia phone environment by clicking the runqpe icon,
which then connects to the qvfb process and displays its contents in
its virtual screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9756f2.large.jpg"><img src="9756f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. qvfb Running with qpe Running in It
</p></div></div><p>
We need to run a script to set our QPEVER and PATH environment variables
and to define some functions for communicating to the phone. If building
for the x86 version of Qtopia, we would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
. /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-x86.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, if building for the actual Greenphone itself, we would choose
the cross-compile environment with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
. /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-greenphone.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we change to our directories and build:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cd ~/projects/application
qtopiamake -project &amp;&amp; qtopiamake &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; gph -p -i

</pre>
</p><p>
The qtopiamake program is Qtopia's version of the Qt qmake utility.
It can generate a .PRO project file based on the contents of the current
directory if given the -project parameter, but its most important job is
to use the project file as the starting point to generate a Makefile based
on the installed configuration of Qtopia and the type of build we want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c39170"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
It might be worthwhile to point out that the commands depicted here are
separated by a double ampersand (&amp;&amp;) to cause execution of the command
string to stop at the first point where it meets an error. In this case,
it would stop the shell from trying to execute or install a
program that had failed to build.
</p></div><p>
Typically, we generate a new .PRO and Makefile only when we have new files
to add to our project, but qtopiamake takes so little time to execute
that it is common to see it run from a standard shell script every time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c393d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>gph Utility</b></p><p>
The gph utility is a useful awk script that provides convenience
functions for doing things like building, packaging, installing and
running applications in the Qtopia environment, either emulated or
actually on the phone. It can be invoked instead of make, and it is
powerful enough that we can use it to convert from raw source code to
running applications installed from a package onto a real or emulated
device.
</p><p>
For example, to rebuild the code, package it and install and run on qvfb,
we would try the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gph -C x86 -debug -c -all
</pre>
</p><p>
If that were to go well, and we were happy with enough to want to run
it on an actual phone, we could build ourselves a package to install with
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gph -C greenphone -p
</pre>
</p><p>
This would give us a file in our pkg directory with a name like
qpe-application_1.0.0-1_arm.qpk.
</p><p>
To have a more complete idea of the gph capabilities, we can look at
its help message:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$gph --help
FORMAT: /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/gph &lt;options&gt;

Options:
 -h          display command help
 -q          quiet mode
 -c          clean
 -C &lt;opt&gt;    reconfig &lt;x86&gt; or &lt;greenphone&gt;, default greenphone
 -b          make
 -p          make package
 -i          install package to greenphone
 -r          run application on greenphone
 -all        reconfig, make, make package, install, run
 -debug      force configure for debug build, override default
 -release    force configure for release build, override default

 -options "&lt;opts&gt;" pass extra options to build system
          eg. /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/gph -C x86 -all -options
"CONFIG+=debug"

 -net        bring up network to greenphone
 -console    console on greenphone
 -qpk &lt;file&gt; install qpk to SDK http server for installation
 -rescan     Tell Qtopia to rescan for new documents and applications

</pre>
</p></div><p>
When applications are packaged for distribution to Qtopia devices,
they reside in .qpk files that are specially made gzip'd tar files.
In addition to the executable file itself, there also are the help files,
multilingual translation files and the desktop entry. This desktop
entry file contains elements to describe the name of the executable,
the icon, what type of application it is and, finally, the MIME type to
indicate what sort of data it can process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c39900"></a>
Debugging on Target</h2></div></div><p>
Debugging our application on the Greenphone itself is fairly easy
to set up.
</p><p>
First, we need to configure our build environment to cross-compile for
the ARM architecture on the Greenphone:

<pre     class="programlisting">
. /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-greenphone.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, we need to rebuild our Makefile and executables, package them up
and install them onto the phone:


<pre     class="programlisting">

qtopiamake -debug &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; gph -p -i -r -debug

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, we can click the arm-linux debugger icon on the desktop,
open the example program on the phone and click run to execute it
in the remote debugger.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c39c18"></a>
Building for Development and Deployment</h2></div></div><p>
A number of application deployment methodologies are available
when developing with the Greenphone SDK.
</p><p>
First, we can build and run our applications so that they execute within
the virtual machine's ersatz phone-like environment complete with a JPEG
skin that looks like a phone sitting on your desktop. It is great for
working out the GUI parts of an application, and it saves us the step of
having to compile, flash on to the unit and debug remotely.
</p><p>
Second, applications can be compiled and packaged for the Greenphone,
then run and tested on the device itself. As mentioned previously, the VM
installs with a gdb debugger that can run inside the virtual machine
and debug applications remotely on the phone.
</p><p>
Finally, we have &ldquo;Phone bounce&rdquo; mode, using the phone as a standard
GSM/GPRS modem connected to the development machine via a USB cable.
Our applications would run inside the emulator on the local machine,
but would be joined logically to the real phone by whatever network link
you have to it, such as a USB connection.
</p><p>
We do not have to customize the Greenphone in a piecemeal fashion.
The Flash image representing the whole Greenphone Linux distribution
on the phone can be updated using either the mini-SD Flash reader or
the USB cable to re-install a complete new Linux distribution along with
all the applications and configuration files. This makes it easier for
enterprise use where items such as standard configuration options are set
to enable things like corporate branding with visual themes, VPN settings,
default address-book entries and localization settings, among others.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c39ed8"></a>
Anatomy of a Qtopia Application</h2></div></div><p>
Qtopia development will make any Qt or KDE developer feel right at home,
as it is quite compatible with the desktop version of Qt.
There are a few minor differences, as we will see in the example
application in the Greenphone SDK found at ~/projects/application.
</p><p>
The style lately, with C++ in general and Qt v4.x in particular, is to
include a header named after the class we want declared. This saves
ever having to guess which header contains a class' declaration.
In the following example, we have the old way commented out and the
easier-to-remember method following it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

// main.cpp
#include "example.h"
// #include &lt;qtopia/qtopiaapplication.h&gt;
#include &lt;QtopiaApplication&gt;

QTOPIA_ADD_APPLICATION("example", Example)
QTOPIA_MAIN

// end of main.cpp

</pre>
</p><p>
The function formerly known as main() has been deprecated in Qtopia
in favor of two macros.
</p><p>
In the above example, the QTOPIA_ADD_APPLICATION macro is
used to create an instance of the main application window. The first
parameter is the executable name, and the second parameter is the base
class of the application window class.
</p><p>
The QTOPIA_MAIN macro expands out either to the traditional main()
function if building a traditional application or to the entry point
needed if building a quick launcher plugin.
</p><p>
Inside our example.h, we find the class declaration for our main window,
which we have sub-classed from a generic QWidget:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#ifndef EXAMPLE_H
#define EXAMPLE_H
#include "ui_examplebase.h"

class ExampleBase : public QWidget, public Ui_ExampleBase
{
public:
    ExampleBase( QWidget *parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 );
    virtual ~ExampleBase();
};

class Example : public ExampleBase
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    Example( QWidget *parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 );
    virtual ~Example();

private slots:
    void goodBye();
};

#endif // EXAMPLE_H
</pre>
</p><p>
This class uses a form created using the Qt Designer GUI building tool,
so we see an include file called ui_examplebase.h that brings in its
declaration. In Qt, headers with names starting with ui_ typically
are Designer-generated. This is followed by our class' immediate ancestor
called ExampleBase. This base class inherits from both QWidget and
the class defined by the GUI builder called Ui_ExampleBase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2747580.0x2c3a350"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
As a brief reminder to newer users of Qt, classes generated by Designer
do not have a base widget that contains all the other widgets inside
it. The code in the generated class instantiates child widgets of
only whatever parent widget instance is passed into its constructor. This is
a reason why we see multiple inheritance used with classes derived from
Qt Designer-generated code&mdash;it provides a single widget from which to hang other
widgets.
</p></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9756f3.large.jpg"><img src="9756f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Designer Running in VM
</p></div></div><p>
Our main window is an instance of the Example class derived from
ExampleBase. It makes use of a technique called signals and slots&mdash;a
method used by Trolltech that allows great flexibility for defining how
a function is invoked. The invoking side of the connection is called a
SIGNAL(), and the invokee side is called a SLOT(). They are joined
together using a method called connect() that allows a many-to-many
connection relationship. Qt uses a preprocessor to add metadata
processing to add to C++ dynamic invocation
and object introspection effectively and elegantly&mdash;elements available in other OOP languages.
</p><p>
Our final code example shows the implementation of our classes:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#include "example.h"
#include &lt;QPushButton&gt;

ExampleBase::ExampleBase( QWidget *parent, Qt::WFlags f )
    : QWidget( parent, f )
{
    setupUi( this );
}

ExampleBase::~ExampleBase() { }

Example::Example( QWidget *parent, Qt::WFlags f )
    : ExampleBase( parent, f )
{
    connect(quit, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(goodBye()));
}

Example::~Example() { }

void Example::goodBye()
{
    close();
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Our ExampleBase class' constructor calls the Designer-generated
setupUi() method to have the form-defined child widgets created and
their layout and other properties set. Without that step, it would be
a generic QWidget.
</p><p>
The next interesting thing we see is the constructor for the Example
class. It calls the connect() method to join the clicked() signal on
the Qt Designer-generated QPushButton called quit with our goodBye()
slot. This allows us to exit the example program by clicking the
QPushButton labeled Quit.

Where to Go from Here</h2></div></div><p>
It would be great to explore many other Qtopia-specific features 
in more detail, such as the QCop IPC mechanism for communication
across processes, the XML-based theming engine, the secure execution
environment (SXE), plus all the phone-specific features, for starters.
</p><p>
Qtopia provides a lot of advantages for the embedded developer designing
applications for mobile phones.
</p><p>
Besides the emulation environment, the code compatibility with desktop
applications and the natural intuitive application framework, I find
that Qtopia does something better than other embedded environments
do&mdash;it helps put the fun back into programming.
