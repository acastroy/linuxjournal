A creative solution for solving Web service performance
bottlenecks, or &ldquo;ix-nay on the ottleneck-bay&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x114a580.0x12423a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Computers are amazingly fast. Think about it&mdash;we measure raw
processor speed by how many instructions it can execute each second,
and that number has gotten so large, we round off to the nearest
hundred million.
</p><p>
Of course, it's often hard to feel that computers are all that speedy,
especially when you're sitting around waiting for them to compete a
task. Sometimes that wait has to do with complex algorithms that take
a while to execute. But in many cases, the problem is a
delay further down in the system, which is causing your end-user
application to wait for a while.
</p><p>
This, I believe, is the major Achilles' heel of the world of Web
services&mdash;Web-based APIs that are making it increasingly easy to
combine (and manipulate) data from multiple sources. Web services may
be revolutionizing distributed application development and deployment,
but they make it tempting (and too easy, sometimes) to create software
whose performance depends on someone else's system.
</p><p>
For example, let's assume you are offering a Web service and
that your program depends, in turn, on a second Web service. Users of
your system might encounter delays at two different points: your Web
service (due to computational complexity, a lack of system resources
or too many simultaneous requests), or the second Web service on which
yours depends.
</p><p>
Several commercial companies, such as Google, eBay and Amazon, offer
Web services to the general public. But, these services lack any sort
of uptime or response guarantee and often restrict the number of
requests you can make. If you write a Web service that depends on one
of these others, a rise in requests to your service might well
mean that you temporarily go over your limit with these services. 
</p><p>
This is particularly true if you allow users to enter one or more
inputs at a time. For example, if you're running a Web-based store,
you want to let people put multiple items in their shopping baskets.
It's easy to imagine a scenario in which each item in the shopping
basket requires a call to one or more Web services. If each call
takes one second, and if you are allowed to access the Web service
only every six seconds, a user trying to buy ten items might end up
waiting one minute just to see the final checkout screen. If a
brick-and-mortar store were to keep you waiting for one minute, you
would be frustrated. If an on-line store were to do the same thing,
you probably would just pick up and leave.
</p><p>
So, what should you do? Well, you could simply throw up your hands
and blame the lower-level service. Or, you could contact the
lower-level service and try to negotiate a faster, better deal for
yourself. Another option is to try to predict what inputs your users
will be handing to you and try to preprocess them, perhaps at night,
when fewer users are on your system.
</p><p>
I've recently come across this problem myself on some of the sites
I've been developing in my consulting work. And, I believe I've
found a technique that solves this problem without too much trouble
and that demonstrates how Ajax programming techniques not only can 
add pizazz to a Web site, but make it more functional as well. This
month, we take a look at the technique I've developed, which I call
(for lack of a better term) incremental form submission.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x114a580.0x1242818"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
Before we continue, let's define the problem we are trying to
solve. Users visiting our site are presented with an HTML form. The
form contains a textarea widget, into which users can enter one
or more words. When a user clicks on the submit button, a
server-side program takes the contents of the textarea and sends it
to a Web service that turns each word into its Pig Latin equivalent.
The server-side program retrieves the results from the Web service
and displays the Pig Latin on the user's screen as HTML.
</p><p>
It goes without saying that this example is somewhat contrived; although
it might be nice to have a Web service that handles translations into
Pig Latin, it takes so little time to do that translation (really, a
simple text transformation), that storing or caching this information
would be foolish. That said, this example is meant to provide food
for thought, rather than a production-ready piece of software.
</p><p>
Let's start with our HTML file, shown in Listing 1. It
contains a short HTML form with a textarea widget (named words) and
a submit button.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x114a580.0x1242a28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. pl-words.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Pig Latin translator&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Enter the words you wish to translate into Pig
       Latin:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;form method="POST" action="pl-words.cgi"&gt;
            &lt;textarea name="words"&gt;Enter words here&lt;/textarea&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Translate" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Clicking on that submit button submits the form's contents to a CGI
program written in Ruby, named pl-word.cgi (Listing 2). There
are two sections to Listing 2. In the first part of the program, we
define a method, pl_sentence, that takes a sentence (that is, a string),
turns it into an array of strings (with each word in one string), and
then passes that array to our Web service (via XML-RPC). The second
half of the program takes the input from our POST request, passes it
to the pl_sentence routine, and then uses the output from pl_sentence
to create a bit of nicely formatted (if Spartan) output for the user.

  sentence_array = sentence.split

  # Send the words, and catch any faults that we find

    results = server.call("atf.pl_sentence", sentence_array)

      cgi.p { "Original sentence: '#{words}'" } +
      cgi.p { "Translated sentence: '#{pl_sentence(words)}'" }
    }
  }
}

</pre></div><p>
The key to making all this work is shown in Listing 3, which provides the
code for our XML-RPC server. We begin by reading from a simple cache
of English words and their Pig Latin equivalents. Again, it seems
silly to store things in this way, when it's much faster simply to write
the code that handles the Pig Latin rules. If you imagine that each
translation takes several seconds, you can see how things could
pile up quickly.

</pre></div><p>
There are several things to notice in this program. One of the first
is the use of an on-disk cache to store recently processed inputs.
(Please don't try to emulate the simple and foolish way in which I
implemented this; I ignored locking and permission issues.) The cache
itself is a simple text file containing name-value pairs. Before
computing the Pig Latin translation of each item, the Web service
consults the cache. If the word is in the cache, the service
grabs that value and almost immediately returns the translated value.
</p><p>
If the word isn't in the cache, it translates the English into
Pig Latin, storing the values for the next time around. Again, this
ensures that we have to work hard (that is, translate the word into
Pig Latin) only if it fails to appear in the cache.
</p><p>
If you've never programmed in Ruby before, you might be put off a
bit by this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
words.map {|word| word.to_s}.each do |word|
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Ruby that it should take the array named words and
turn each of its elements into a string. (If the element already is a
string, it is unaffected.) We then iterate over each string
(word) in the array, assigning the local variable word to each
element in sequence. 
</p><p>
With Listings 1, 2 and 3 in place, you should be able to translate
sentences from English into Pig Latin without too much difficulty.
You enter the English words into the HTML form, the server-side
program calls the Web service, and the Web service takes care of
things quickly.

Improving Performance</h2></div></div><p>
Now we come to the hard, or interesting, part of this project. If you
can imagine that each Pig Latin translation takes ten seconds to
execute, but less than one second to retrieve from the cache, you
would want the cache to be used as much as possible. Moreover, given
how long each word lookup takes, users will need a great deal of
patience to deal with it.
</p><p>
The solution? Use Prototype, a popular
JavaScript framework. Its
AjaxUpdater will submit the contents of the textarea
widget to a URL of your choice automatically&mdash;in this case, the same one that is
used for POST&mdash;in the background, each time the text area is
changed. Then, each word is translated while the user is filling out
the text form, dramatically reducing the time needed to translate.
</p><p>
In other words, I'm betting it will take enough time for users to
enter the entire sentence, that I can collect and translate most or
all of the translated words while they're typing. Also, because I
know that the Web service is caching results, I can pass the contents
of the entire textarea every few seconds, knowing that retrieving
items from the cache is extremely rapid.
</p><p>
The key to this functionality is the use of the
Form.Element.Observer object in JavaScript. This object allows us
to monitor any form element over time, submitting the form's contents
to an arbitrary URL when the form element changes. We will use this,
along with our knowledge that the Pig Latin server (pl-server.rb)
caches words it has already translated, to submit the form
every few seconds, even before the user clicks the submit
button. 
</p><p>
We do this by adding an id attribute, whose value is words, to our
textarea, and also by adding the following JavaScript code:


<pre     class="programlisting">
new Form.Element.Observer($("words"), 3, translateFunction);
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, we will check the words in textarea for changes every
three seconds. If something has changed, the browser invokes the
method translateFunction. This function is defined as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function translateFunction() {

var myAjax = new Ajax.Request(
    '/pl-words.cgi',
    {
        parameters: Form.serialize('form')
    });
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, translateFunction creates a new Ajax request in the
background, submitting the contents of the form to the URL
/pl-words.cgi&mdash;the same program to which the form will be
submitted at the end of the process. But, for our incremental
submissions, we care more about the side effects (that is, the cached
translations) than the resulting HTML. So, we ignore the output from
pl-words.cgi.
</p><p>
Because of how we built our server-side programs, they don't need to
change at all in order for this Ajax-style addition to take effect.
All we need to do is modify the HTML file, adding a few lines of
JavaScript.
</p><p>
Now, of course, this doesn't change the amount of time it takes
to translate each word or even an entire sentence. But, that's not
the point. Rather, what we're doing is taking advantage of the fact
that many people tend to type slowly and that they'll take their time
entering words into a textarea widget.
</p><p>
If users type quickly, or enter a very short sentence, we
haven't really lost anything at all. It'll take a long time to
translate those people's sentences, and they'll just have to wait it
out. If people change their minds a great deal, it's
possible we'll end up with all sorts of cached, translated words
that are never going to be used again. But, given that the cache is
shared across all users, it seems like a relatively small risk to
take.
</p><p>
There are some things to consider if you're thinking of going this
route&mdash;that is, combining an incremental form submission with a
cache.
First, notice we are iterating over each word in the
textarea. This means there's the potential for someone to launch
a denial-of-service attack against your server, simply by entering
ridiculously long text strings into your textarea widget. One way to
prevent this is to limit the number of words you check from any given
textarea widget. You can, of course, limit the number of words you're
willing to translate from the incremental submission, rather than from
the complete and final submission.
</p><p>
Another item to remember is that you should not expose your inner
APIs. APIs are for external use; the moment people know your
internal data structures and methods, they might use them against
you. These examples didn't include any cleaning or testing of the
data that was passed to the server; in a real-world case, you probably would
want to do that before simply passing it along to another
program.
</p><p>
Finally, if your site becomes popular, you might need more than one
server to handle Web services. That's fine, and it's even a good idea.
But, how many servers should you get, and how should they store their
data? One possibility, and something that I expect to write about in
the coming months, is Amazon's EC2 (Electric Computing Cloud)
technology, which allows you to launch an almost limitless number of
Web servers quickly and for a reasonable price. Combining EC2 with
this sort of caching Web service might work well, especially if you
have a good method for sharing dynamic data among the servers.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Web services are a wonderful way for servers to share data. But, when
a Web service becomes a bottleneck, and when we lack control over the
size of the bottleneck, we must try to find creative solutions.
This month, we looked at something that I call incremental posting,
designed to spread the burden over time, as a user is typing. Even
if this solution isn't quite right for you, perhaps you'll be inspired
in some way to incorporate this, or other Ajax techniques, into your
own sites.
