David Trask leverages the flexibility and power of FOSS to
create a waste-not-want-not approach to educational computing.

This month, I step outside my normal persona to describe a
small conference named FOSSED (<a href="http://www.fossed.net" target="_self">www.fossed.net</a>). I attended two sessions
of FOSSED, one in June 2007 and one in July 2007, which finished just two days
before I wrote this article.
</p><p>
David Trask, a friend of mine, initiated FOSSED five years ago.
David is an elementary schoolteacher in Maine, and he is &ldquo;student
focused&rdquo;. He often reminds people that his customers
are the students, and in David's case, these are second- and third-grade
students, eight to ten years old. David, like many teachers, always is
asked to &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo;, and in
the course of trying to do this, he discovered free and open-source software.
</p><p>
David started using FOSS in his own school. He became a fan of the Linux
Terminal Server Project (LTSP, <a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">www.ltsp.org</a>) and started re-deploying
cast-off equipment to create more computing nodes for his students.
David also is a student of human nature, and as he started to deploy more
and more of these systems for his own students, and as they started
doing more and more in his own classes, he offered some of these
computers to other teachers. David also is adept
in telling stories about his young charges and how easily they adapt
to FOSS while older people complain how hard it is.
After a while, David began sending out e-mail messages regarding his successes to
a mailing list read by Maine educators involved with technology.
</p><p>
Eventually, David realized enough people were interested in this topic that
he decided to have a few seminars and actually demonstrate
the capabilities. After a few of these seminars,
David started talking about the possibility of having a conference
specifically
about the use of FOSS in grade-school education. So, five years ago, David
and another FOSS enthusiast held the first educational FOSS conference
at Gould Academy (a residential high school in Maine) and called the
conference NELS, for North East Linux Symposium. They later
realized that Linux was a small (although important) part of FOSS
educational software, so they renamed the conference FOSSED.
</p><p>
In June 2007, right after school let out, 70 elementary-, middle- and high-school teachers and technologists descended on Gould Academy. Out of
the backs of cars and trucks came systems removed from school labs and
homes, networking gear and personal laptops for taking notes. In
addition,
several sponsors supplied a dozen or more thin-client systems and a
server,
so people could use them during the event. [Note to sponsors of other
events like this: the thin clients went on sale after the event at a
&ldquo;special price&rdquo; to attendees.]
</p><p>
By this time, David had picked up several other helpers. Matt Oquist,
the founder of Software Freedom Day (<a href="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org" target="_self">www.softwarefreedomday.org</a>), who 
also is a consultant to various school systems in the use of free
software, helps David in the planning and execution of logistics
and teaches some classes. Bill Sconce, a consultant
and scripting wizard, gives courses in scripting languages 
for more-advanced participants to show how to maintain many systems using
a shell script, Python and other scripting languages. Bryant Patton,
a longtime advocate of computers in education and the founder of the
National Center for Open Source and Education in Vermont, also helps out.
But, David Trask remains the driving force and cheerleader, and for
the past two years, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) has held a second session of this conference with almost as many
attendees as the sessions in Maine.
</p><p>
Five years after David started the conference, the amount of software
that exists for educational use is very impressive. A couple 
seminars are centered around the use of Moodle to plan and present
classroom material. One teacher volunteered to talk about Web 2.0
tools and show the other teachers how some of the Web's new features 
could be used to stimulate student creativity. At the same
time, she discussed doing this in a safe way and getting around
the advertising bombardment that sometimes accompanies gratis sites.
</p><p>
Although a core component of the conference is LTSP usage and administration,
it also has branched out to discussions on LDAP for ease of
administration, IP Cop (for setting up firewalls), creating 
software packages (think .deb and .rpm) and a variety of other
system-administration topics. It was interesting to see how one
moment the person sitting next to me was a student in a class on how
to use VMware effectively, and the next moment that
same person was teaching a course on some other aspect of free
software&mdash;teachers teaching teachers.
</p><p>
Sometimes the thing most obvious to you may be the biggest
revelation to another person. I had not used VMware since its early
days when it was difficult to install and get working. At the
conference, I
&ldquo;installed&rdquo; VMware (actually it was a package already done for Ubuntu),
entered the key, installed an Edubuntu server on it and booted a thin
client running off the virtualized server on my notebook&mdash;all of this
while I was still editing and sending e-mail through my notebook's
wireless card. I am now quite a fan of VMware, and I am sorry I
haven't spent more time with it over the years.
</p><p>
On the other hand, when the teachers mentioned that there was so much
software on SourceForge that they didn't have time to evaluate it
all, I suggested that they ask students to find, test and select
software the class might want to use and present their results and
reasoning to the class&mdash;the 21st-century version of the 19th-century
book report. A stunned silence fell over the room.
</p><p>
At the UNH sessions, a group of high-school
students and their advisers came up from the Arlington, Virginia, school
system (an 11-hour ride by car in two vans) to demonstrate 
a project called CanDo that they had been creating. Then, after getting
feedback from the teachers about new features and GUI changes,
the students went into a two-day (and sometimes night) hacking session to
implement those changes. It warmed my heart to see
that the group of students was a diverse mixture of young men and women,
different races and nationalities, and they all seemed to get along fine.
This was the second year that they participated in the conference,
and it was good to see some of the same faces return.
</p><p>
Finally, the teachers listened to and gave feedback to several of the
vendors who had open-source products used at the event, and to one vendor
who was struggling with whether the company should go open source
and the consequences of doing that. Direct feedback from customers
is usually a good thing to have.
</p><p>
Many things impressed me about this conference, but one of them was the
goodwill and camaraderie that managed to come through all the
time&mdash;people working with each other and having fun learning. The organizers
try very hard to have a comfortable venue and a relaxed schedule, and
although it's too late to participate in a FOSSED event this
year, you can start thinking about participating
in next year's event, or (better yet) start thinking about creating a
similar
event in your own region of the world.
