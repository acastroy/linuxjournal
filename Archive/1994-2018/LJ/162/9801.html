Inaccurate Items in Magnatune Article</h4><p>
I have to raise an objection (or five) to the Magnatune article in the
August 2007 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
First, Apple's iTunes uses AAC, the same audio codec for DVDs you get
off the shelf. This codec is much tighter in compression but has better
audio quality than MP3.
</p><p>
Second, DRM'd iTunes music is encoded at 128kbps using AAC. A buck
a song at 128kbps sounds rather decent.
</p><p>
Third, EMI's non-DRM'd music will sell for $1.29, but it will be double
the encoding rate, 256kbps, so it will sound much better. This
doubling of the bandwidth (which I doubt will all be used) will
make the files pulled bigger, and thus the extra cost is justifiable.
</p><p>
Fourth, the non-DRM'd music is still encoded in AAC format and
possibly wrapped in an MPEG-4 container. It won't be MP3'd; it won't
be WMA'd&mdash;both for Apple's legal eye will require licensing the
codec. Plus, iPods can't listen to Ogg Vorbis files either. Apple
hasn't thought about putting in the free (as in freedom) codec in the
iPod's firmware as well as QuickTime.
</p><p>
Fifth, EMI's music catalog isn't all DRM-free yet.
</p><p>
Apparently, the person who wrote the article forgot to do his
research. I believe the keynotes of the past WWDC and MacWorld
conferences should help. They're still up on iTunes as podcasts for
free (as in beer).

Sold on Kubuntu</h4><p>
Being a UNIX/Linux user for more than 30 years and seeing
the evolution of computers has been very interesting.
First, we had large pieces of iron on raised floors
and huge air conditioning bills and large support
staff, and we all carried large boxes of cards for
the larger programs.
</p><p>
I got my PhD in Astrophysics in 1972, and my dissertation
required more than $1,000,000 in computer time on a CDC 7600
and then later on a Cray 1S. It was taking 3.5 hours per
case for simulation of light transport in real planetary
atmospheres. Now I can do a case in less than ten minutes
on an AMD64. I still wonder if people fully realize
just how much compute power they have at their fingertips.
</p><p>
I wrote a book in 1978, and in Chapter 1, I wrote that
I had figured out what the human race was doing overall.
We are trying to get all of human knowledge at the
fingertips of every man, woman and child on the planet.
We are about to get there.
</p><p>
Back to your article [Nicholas Petreley's &ldquo;Amazing Free
Distributions Abound&rdquo;, July 2007]. I used SUSE for years and
years. But last year, I was converted to Kubuntu, and with
7.04, there is no way I can ever go to another distro.
It has, with all the official repositories, given me
access to more programs and utilities than I'll ever need.
</p><p>
Last year, I developed a short Intro to Linux course for free
adult training centers and continuing education facilities.
I use Kubuntu 7.04 because of the live CD and the ease
of installation. I also use a cheap Airlink USB Wi-Fi critter
for $10 on sale at Fry's Electronics that plugs and plays
without intervention by the owner and really, really helps
get things going.
</p><p>
I am working on getting freshmen high-school students to start
up on Linux. Think about it. They would never have to
buy another piece of software for the rest of their
high-school and college careers. They'd have every compiler they
ever would need. They would have OpenOffice.org for their
reports and spreadsheets, and LaTeX for engineers and
mathematicians for any mathematics they encounter.
The list goes on and on.
</p><p>
I developed and taught all the courses at Silicon Graphics
until I retired 12 years ago, when SGI started downhill.
So, I guess it's still in my blood to continue the fight
against ignorance. &ldquo;Push back the frontiers of ignorance&rdquo;
was my motto as a prof and instructor. Get a thought to
go where no thought has gone before. 
</p><p>
Keep up the good work.

Don't Bogart That Link, My Friend</h4><p>
In the Tech Tips column in the July 2007 issue, a method to prevent services from
starting is described for those who do not want to use the graphical
interfaces. However, there is a specific command-line tool available just
for that task, chkconfig. I think this tool works even better than
crowding the /etc/rc[0-6].d directories with unclear links.
</p><p>
From the chkconfig man page: &ldquo;chkconfig provides a simple command-line 
tool for maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving 
system administrators of the task of directly manipulating the numerous 
symbolic links in those directories.&rdquo;
</p><p>
To follow the example in the magazine, instead of renaming S25bluetooth
to s25bluetooth, simply type <tt  >chkconfig bluetooth
off</tt> (and <tt  >chkconfig
bluetooth on</tt> to turn it back on again).

Don't Short Python</h4><p>
It's a little late to be writing about the June 2007 issue, but I just
reread the Lua article, and I'm a bit disappointed, so I thought I'd
write.
</p><p>
In general, it seems to be a pretty good introduction to Lua. However,
the author did a lot of comparing to Python, and I think that comparison
was done unfairly. Whenever such a language article is written, it really
should be reviewed by an expert in the language it's being compared to. The author
is clearly not very experienced with Python, and it shows.
</p><p>
Lua has a key advantage for its intended purpose (its impressively small
size), but people should select it for its real advantages, not because
of mistaken impressions. In general, it looks to me like many of Lua's
traits make it quite unsuitable for large programs, which is fine, as
it's not intended for that. However, Python is pretty darn suitable for
both large and small.

More Ruby on Rails</h4><p>
I have really been digging <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> ever since I subscribed to your
fine publication. Lately, I've been enjoying the shell scripting
articles,
and in the July 2007 issue, the article on vector graphics was rather
interesting. In the future, I think you guys should do some more articles on 
Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I really enjoyed the one edition almost completely 
dedicated to Ruby. It would really tickle my fancy if you put some more 
Linux Web-development-related things into the magazine. Anyway, keep up 
the good work with making my favorite Linux publication.

No SOP Here, Move Along</h4><p>
As a developer of embedded systems, including Linux, for the past two
decades, I was very interested in the article &ldquo;Standard Operating
Procedures for Embedded Linux Systems&rdquo; [August 2007]. The article seems to describe a
limited approach to embedded Linux development and certainly not an
&ldquo;SOP&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The primary software described, buildroot, is a terrific and powerful
tool for embedded developers, as are many packages from uclibc.com;
however, such high-level tools come with limitations. Buildroot, for
example, is heavily entwined with the uClibc library, which is not a
viable choice for every system. The &ldquo;five standard
procedures&rdquo; violate
basic design methodology by selecting the hardware first. Once all
packages are selected, only then can a tool like buildroot be
considered; only amateurs select the tools before determining the task.
</p><p>
The article appropriately focuses on reducing memory and storage
requirements, but no mention is made of alternate compressed filesystems, Flash filesystems and especially the new xip (execute in
place) file support. Understanding the limitations of the space-saving
software, such as uClibc and BusyBox, requires deep knowledge but is
ignored in this article. Using packages that are not designed for
cross-build is very difficult, despite the article's statement that it
sometimes makes good sense to build these packages on the target.
Bootup and shutdown time is important for many embedded systems, and
this has design implications regarding hardware and software but isn't
mentioned. Often, some new kernel feature is required, but upgrading the
kernel may not be possible (many BSPs are dropped or rendered
nonfunctional in time), so devising a solution is difficult,
which is not addressed.
</p><p>
I wish we could download a tool, run a configurator and have a
functional image pop out, trim a little &ldquo;fat&rdquo;, install and ship, but
life is rarely so simple. It's a nice article on one group's basic
development process, but there is nothing standard here. &ldquo;One size fits
all&rdquo; isn't yet a viable approach for embedded Linux.
