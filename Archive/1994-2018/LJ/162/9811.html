There is history here. We first covered Jabber in the September 2000
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, more than seven years ago.
At the time, Jeremie
Miller, who invented Jabber, told me at least five years would pass
before Jabber's protocol&mdash;later dubbed XMPP and approved by the IETF
in 2003&mdash;would establish itself as a de facto standard. He was right.
</p><p>
We've stayed in touch over the years, as Jeremie's interests have spread
outward from messaging and presence to other subjects&mdash;especially
search. I guess it was about two years ago that he began to question
whether search needed to be a single-source thing (for example, Google or
Yahoo). That was when he also started talking about his new search
project, called Atlas. Whenever I'd ask him what he was working on, he'd
reply, &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I was all for it, because I've felt from the start that search engines
are essentially kluges meant to overcome a directory deficiency in the
Web itself. I've also thought that, although there was good to be found in
the chaotic nature of everything to the right of the first single slash
in every URL on the Web, there was something inherently wrong about
relying on massive commercial advertising-powered search engines&mdash;with
their bots and crawlers and proprietary weighting algorithms chugging
through constantly updated indexes stored in hundreds of thousands of
servers&mdash;just to find stuff. And, although I agree with David Weinberger
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Everything Is Miscellaneous</em></span> (the title of his excellent new book),
I don't like relying on Google, Yahoo or MSN alone (usually just Google)
to tell me what I mean when I search for something. Nothing matters more
than meaning, and I don't like seeing it supplied by what Jeremie calls
a &ldquo;text box dictatorship&rdquo;. In a May 28, 2007 blog post, he
asks:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Why in such an advanced civilization have we become Knowledge
Peasants who are so easily placated by the black magic of our
Goovernor? Am I the only one wondering why these commercial boxes
own such an important social function: what everything means?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The answer, he says, is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Open open open! Open source, open distributed grids, open
algorithms, open rankings, open networks of people cooperating to
provide resources. The future of search is in open cooperation (and
competition) based on a Meaning Economy&mdash;create meaning, exchange
meaning, serve meaning.
</p><p>
My vision begins with an <span   class="emphasis"><em>open protocol</em></span>, allowing independent
networks of search functions (crawling, indexing, ranking, serving,
etc.) to peer and interop. All relationships between these networks
are always fully transparent and openly published. Networks exchange
knowledge between them, each adding new meaning to the information,
each of them responsible for the reputations of their participants
and peers. This is the very foundation of a Meaning Economy.
</p><p>
Tomorrow now has a meaning that we can all help build.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Jeremie hasn't been the only one on the open search case. Jimmy Wales,
prime mover behind Wikipedia, attracted attention in December of last
year when he said, &ldquo;I want to create a completely transparent,
open-source, freely licensed search engine&rdquo;&mdash;as part of Wikia.org, a
community development companion to Wikipedia. In a December 29, 2006
interview
(<a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2006/12/72376?currentPage=2" target="_self">www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2006/12/72376?currentPage=2</a>),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> asked him for specifics about that. Jimmy's
reply was, &ldquo;We don't
know. That's something that's really very open-ended at this moment.
It's really up to the community, and I suspect that there won't be a
one-size-fits-all answer. It will depend on the topic and the type of
search being conducted.&rdquo; Subsequent interviews were similarly
speculative and open-ended.
</p><p>
Then, on May 1, 2007, came news that Jeremie was joining the Wikia
Project. In a prepared statement
(<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-6180379.html" target="_self">news.com.com/2100-1032_3-6180379.html</a>), Jimmy
Wales said, &ldquo;Jeremie is a brilliant
thinker and a natural fit to help revolutionize the world of search....I
believe Internet search is currently broken, and the way to fix it is to
build a community whose mission is to develop a search platform that is
open and totally transparent.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Atlas was unveiled in a post to a list on July 5, 2007
(<a href="http://lists.wikia.com/pipermail/atlas-l/2007-July/000000.html" target="_self">lists.wikia.com/pipermail/atlas-l/2007-July/000000.html</a>). In
that post, Jeremie said his &ldquo;large vision&rdquo; is &ldquo;enabling search to become
a part of the Internet's infrastructure. Building on Atlas as an open
protocol, search can become a fully distributed and interoperable
world-wide community. All of the participants can interact openly and in
any role where they believe they can add value to the network.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As for architecture, he offered this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
There are three primary roles within Atlas:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Factory&mdash;responsible to the content.
</p></li><li><p>
Collector&mdash;responsible to the keyword.
</p></li><li><p>
Broker&mdash;responsible to the Searcher. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each of these actors must interact with the others to complete any
search request. Any two roles could be performed by a single entity
(whereas if all three are performed by one entity, the result would
be a traditional, monolithic search engine).
</p><p>
A Factory is akin to a crawler in today's search engines. An Atlas
Factory must fetch and process the content as intelligently as
possible, performing analysis (such as Natural Language Processing)
and normalizing it into distinct units. A Factory shares its highly
refined and processed output with one or more Collectors based on
who they believe is best utilizing it.
</p><p>
A Collector absorbs and indexes output from one or more Factories,
with one primary goal: ranking. An Atlas Collector must provide the
most intelligent ranking and relationship analysis possible. A
Collector has to compete for the output of a Factory, as well as
compete to provide the best ranking quality for Brokers.
</p><p>
A Broker must provide a Searcher with the best possible results. It
does so by combining diverse ranking results from Collectors and
also by retrieving content from the original Factories. This last
step, a Broker interacting with a Factory, is critical to
maintaining a balanced ecosystem. All Factories must be aware of and
approve how their results are being used and by whom.
</p><p>
Reputation and reward is bi-directional between all parties
(Factory-Collector, Collector-Broker and Broker-Factory). Each
entity may choose to interact on principle (free, Commons),
attribution (results provided by), or commercially (as a paid
service). The Atlas protocol is purely a facilitator and does not
restrict how the relationships between any entities are formed. In
considering these motives for the various entities, it's likely that
the free-based networks will tend to become more specialized,
commercial ones will compete on quality, and attribution-based
networks will mature in both directions.
</p><p>
This simple yet powerful division of roles, responsibilities and
relationships will result in a distributed economic foundation for
an Internet Search Infrastructure. The wire protocol and further
definition of the interactions between these entities is openly
evolving; anyone interested is welcomed to join the discussions and
see the initial proposals at
<a href="http://lists.wikia.com/mailman/listinfo/atlas-l" target="_self">lists.wikia.com/mailman/listinfo/atlas-l</a> over the coming weeks.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As a kind of gauntlet, Jeremie threw down a summary challenge, &ldquo;Nobody
will beat Google, but EVERYBODY will.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Vigorous discussion ensued, as a rapidly growing community of developers
began getting into what Jeremie calls &ldquo;the dirty work of building it
openly now&rdquo;. As that work began, I asked him if it would be cool to flow
some of our conversation over here to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. He said sure, so
here it is.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS: There is always this tug between monolith and polylith. The irony
of the Net as a Giant Zero (world of ends) is that it is entirely
polylithic&mdash;or wants to be. Centralizing a future polylithic protocol
into a monolithic service is one way it starts. But the end state is
polylithic.</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: I agree, it's inevitable. It's the being of the Net itself that
ultimately demands it, but Google is fighting to be a monolith for as
long as possible...and that's fine, they'll embrace Atlas when they see
it providing value.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: In your announcement [above] I see the seeds of a
credit-where-due-based economic system&mdash;one in which we might obtain
finders fees, or something like that, as value is given for service
performed.</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: The attribution-based model, yes. Absolutely the middle man needs
to be involved in the transaction. Atlas doesn't flow the money, but it
does flow the information and provide a framework. The same with
advertising. Really, contextual ads are very helpful. I rely on them as
a tool when using Google search. And in fact, that model is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span>
form of fighting Web spam.
</p><p>
How the system works, and who is involved in the flow of information, is
completely transparent, so the three actors&mdash;a Factory, a Collector
and a Broker&mdash;are all involved in providing a search result. A Broker
works on behalf of the Searcher. They have relationships with the
appropriate Collectors, plural, and perform the queries&mdash;assembling all
the relevant &ldquo;Knuggets&rdquo; they get back from the Collectors, valuing
them based on whatever metrics they want, including talking to a
&ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; Collector who serves only commercial results,
any &ldquo;local&rdquo;
Collectors for regional areas, and so on.
</p><p>
Competition is fierce when anyone can be a Broker for almost no cost
other than relationships. So, a Collector has one job, provides relevant
results, and has to compete with anyone else to do so. And, it can judge
the relevancy via any algorithmic, human-reputation-based, or
combination.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Open source at the production end has always been a meritocracy.
Seems to me the equivalent with Atlas to &ldquo;show me the code&rdquo;
is &ldquo;show me
the results&rdquo;. Or at least, &ldquo;show me the relevancy&rdquo;. No?</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: The Factory is managing commodity access to the refined content,
doing all the work of normalizing the Web. Search results are just
merit: who has the best. And a Broker going to many sources, many
Collectors (there can be lots of them) gains lots of merits in different
forms. So foxmarks has a great database of deep links that are very
important to people. That way Mitch can serve high-quality results but
only for certain categories of queries. And Wikipedia can serve another
category of queries with high relevancy&mdash;as can local yellow-page-style
systems, as can social networks for people queries.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: I see implicit in this a respect for the snowballing nature of
knowledge, both for individuals and for groups. To be human is to grow
what one knows. Authority is the right we grant certain others to
contribute to what we know&mdash;and to change us in the process. Knowing
more makes me different. As has been said elsewhere, &ldquo;we are all authors
of each other&rdquo;.</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Yes, the fundamental unit of Atlas is a &ldquo;Knugget&rdquo;, a Knowledge Nugget
essentially, a search result. A Factory adds value based on what it
knows about the content; a Collector adds value based on what it knows
about keywords and ranking Knuggets; and a Broker adds value based on
what Collectors it knows and what value they provide in aggregate.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Wikipedia, in growing its own relevance, is an interesting
example. I've been looking at radio stations and Webcasters. Wikipedia
on the whole is a great source of info, but it's far from complete. And, it
needs a better way to stay complete than just relying on narrow subject
obsessives to stay on top of the current narrative. Search results that
feed into better Knuggets that turn into better Wikipedia entries should
be a Good Thing, no?</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Yes.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Is a Knugget &ldquo;something somebody wants to know&rdquo;? I like the word.
How about if it's a combination of keywords that may change over
time?</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: A Knugget is one unit of context, as I define it. It may be a
title and a link; it may be a sentence saying something about a noun; it
might be a row from a table of things. It's human-defined and, therefore,
very fuzzy by its very nature. It's &ldquo;What would a human recognize
and make some sense of, out of context of anything other than what's
contained inside of it?&rdquo; The Web is human, not machine, and Atlas
reflects that.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: I like contextuality. The summit of Mt. Everest can be an
elevation, a sum of climbers, a single fact (such as, it is marine
limestone).</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Yes. The very nature of Atlas is to demand that a Factory produces
the best Knuggets, that a Factory &ldquo;understands&rdquo; the content as best as
it can. It is a model that rewards human understanding and value first.
All derivative knowledge is built atop that foundation, and we can reduce
all of these inflated DB/schema disasters, which all serve the machine
first. Atlas works in the same way that the Internet served people
first, and servers/data centers second&mdash;and the Web content serves
people first and software second. Search-as-Internet-infrastructure
must serve people first.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Yes. I think there is a Static (traditional Google) vs. Live
(human, now, evolving) distinction here. Allow me to quote myself at a
bit of length: &ldquo;And as for live feeds of Knuggets as they are produced, any content
provider can get the most value by generating these feeds of Knuggets
into Collectors they trust, search results can be instantly rewarded, a
Searcher can find that breaking-news article
immediately.&rdquo;</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
One becomes an Atlas Broker just by being involved, I would gather.
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Just by searching, and knowing whom to ask for results.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: How do you want to seed this thing? Where does actual use start
first?</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: An Atlas Broker should be living here in my IM client, using all
this great context, LOCALLY, to search my IM history as well as
provide the best relevant search results from any content store I want
it to.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Who is the Broker?
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: The Broker is a human. The Broker is just a service that uses as
much context as you, the Searcher, wants to give it, and it talks to many
Collectors to merge/provide the best results.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: So, how are you seeding this thing?
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: I'm already starting to set up Atlas Factories. We may announce a
contest to build open-source Collectors that can do different/cool
things with, say, the Internet Archive. Once Atlas starts to breathe on
its own, and can publish that archive either openly or gated
(attribution-based or paid), or if it can rank Web results better for
a certain class of queries, it can use that data as a Collector and
offer that again, openly or gated. But that's speculative and premature.
It's all wide open at this stage.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Outstanding. I know some investors
have leaned on Technorati to blow away the archives because that's not
what they search. Yet.</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
I guess I need to get a sense of what a search might look like,
and how it would come up with stuff that's different from Google's
static search and Technorati's live (chrono) search. Would I go to
atlas.wikia.org to search? Or to...where? Or is that question too
static or site-based?</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: I don't have a &ldquo;static&rdquo; presence for Atlas yet. Kind of refusing
even to do that for whatever reasons. Just a link to the mailing list
for now is all there is. Someday there will be a presence, but the
discussion is more important right now. I like it that all people can do
at the moment is discuss.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: I'm just looking at how to help people conceive What It Is. Is
it a site? A service that other sites, or even IM systems, or cell-phone
apps, can use?
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Atlas is an idea, a model and, ultimately, a communication system
between two people: the one that wants to learn and the one that wants
to teach/share. It's just another communication platform, but the people
talking don't know each other yet. Like all good Internet systems, it
will live under the hood, behind text input boxes everywhere.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: In that respect, it's more like the Jabber &ldquo;platform&rdquo; than the AIM
or Skype &ldquo;platforms&rdquo;.</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Yep, in that Google, Yahoo and Ask are the IM silos, and Atlas is the
distributed/open Jabber model.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Good. I get that. Is Atlas code that sits somewhere and is given a
bunch of stuff to look at? If so, where does it live? Is there a drawing
we can use? Some kind of simple whiteboarding?
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Where stuff is almost doesn't matter. As far as visualizations go,
the &ldquo;logical&rdquo; one is really Factory&rarr;Collector&rarr;Broker, but the
technical one is more of a triangle, as the Broker talks to the Factory
in the end to get the Knuggets...but basically no, there's nothing
visual <span   class="emphasis"><em>yet</em></span>. A Factory is going to &ldquo;look&rdquo; like a pile of search results
ordered based on the content source alone. A Collector will
aggregate/order them. And a Broker will aggregate from lots of
Collectors the ordered results, merging them, getting the snippets from
the Factories they came from, and presenting them. By the way, someone
made the first visualization of the model (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9811f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Visualization of the Atlas Model (from <a href="http://search.wikia.com/wiki/Atlas" target="_self">search.wikia.com/wiki/Atlas</a>)
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Where would they live? The actors...Factory, Collector,
Broker...or the code for it all?
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Oh, anyone can run any of them. There will be open-source projects
to provide each of them. But, there should be thousands of each, running
everywhere around the world. Just like Jabber, e-mail and Web servers. They
just talk to each other with a protocol. There can be locale-based
specific instances, ones for different languages, ones for types of
content (images, videos), ones for topics (gaming, finance)&mdash;whatever
people want to do/specialize in. People can run them for whatever
reasons they want. A Broker is really the endpoint, so the nature of
the search has the Broker engaging the relevant Collectors. A Broker is
doing what the word really means, brokering your search to lots of
sources for the best results. A Broker is what would likely be built
in to your browser or whatever is driving an input box anywhere.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: I like the way it maps to the real world.
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: It doesn't force an operational model, and it just goes with whatever
motives people have to run it. The good part is that it will work
only if people find it valuable enough to run it; those are the best kinds of
systems. So is all of this clear as mud?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS: Good mud!
</b></span>
</p><p>
JM: Thanks.
</p><p>
For more, look up Jeremie and Atlas on Google.
</p><p>
Until you can do the reverse.
