    The value and importance of trademarks.

you a glass of sweetened, carbonated water, caramel-colored, with
natural and artificial flavors and caffeine. Would you drink it?
Would you want to know who made it? Would you want to know in
advance that your drink will taste like the sweetened, carbonated
water that you enjoyed so much several days earlier?
</p><p>Now, supposed your favorite lunch spot offered you a Pepsi.
Would your questions about quality (good or bad) and product
consistency suddenly go away? What would you select if given the
choice between a Coca-Cola and a Melvyn's Cola? Would you be more
likely to select a product simply because you are familiar with its
name and reputation?</p><p>We are all caught up in marketing. Television and other
advertising media continually inundate us with product names that
we almost automatically add to our vocabulary, as if they were
words in the English language. But these product names are not
words in the traditional sense, nor are they intended to be so
used. Terms like Windows, Apple, Java, Apache, Linux, Jabber and
JBoss are marketing names&mdash;trademarks. When carefully selected and
protected, and through effective marketing, trademarks can become
badges of quality, expertise and reputation.</p><p>Trademarks are potentially among the most valuable assets of
companies that market free and open-source software. For some
projects, a trademark is much more important than the license under
which the software is distributed.</p><p>Trademarks are a form of intellectual property, but they are
very different from patents, which protect invention; copyrights,
which protect expression; and trade secrets, which protect a
company's confidential information. Trademarks are brand names of
products or services. They serve to protect the reputation of a
product.</p><p>More specifically, a trademark is a word, name, symbol or
device used to identify a company's products and to distinguish
those products from the competition. A service mark is the same as
a trademark except it is used to identify and distinguish services
rather than products. A trade name identifies a company rather than
that company's individual products or services. The same symbol
might function as a trademark, a service mark and a trade name,
depending on the context in which it is used. Here I will generally
use the term trademark and ignore the subtle distinctions of
service marks and trade names.</p><p>A company doesn't acquire trademark rights simply by choosing
a trademark or even by stating its intent to use it. Trademarks (or
service marks) in the United States are established by actual use
in conjunction with specific goods (or services). There are
advantages to registering trademarks with the US Patent and
Trademark Office, but registration alone doesn't make a trademark
valid or valuable. Only actual use of a trademark on goods, and a
marketing campaign to breed familiarity among consumers, can create
a valid and valuable trademark.</p><p>Free and open-source products pose difficult marketing
problems. The licenses under which such products are distributed
require the distribution of source code and permit the creation and
distribution of derivative works. It is difficult for a distributor
of such products to compete on price alone because almost any
knowledgeable company can undercut the price by simply copying the
original software.</p><p>Trademarks can be particularly useful in this kind of
environment. First, a company needs to demonstrate that its
software is of high quality, reliable, efficient, feature-rich and
user-friendly. It can promise continual enhancements, product
support, user groups and undertake other goodwill-creating
activities. Then over time, through marketing efforts, that
company's customers will begin to associate its trademarks and
service marks with those products and services. New or repeat
customers will pay for goods and services they perceive to be worth
the price, and they will select preferentially products whose
trademarks they identify.</p><p>Trademarks can also limit certain kinds of forking of free
and open-source code. While your software license may allow others
to make derivative works of your code, the license doesn't allow
(indeed, there is a legal reason why it cannot allow) others to
apply your trademark to their derivative works.</p><p>In any industry where it is not technically difficult to
create a new product, whether it be the cola beverage industry or
the free and open-source software industry, trademarks and service
marks can provide the best protection for a company's products and
services.</p><p>We see this every day when customers order Coca-Cola and
Pepsi rather than Melvyn's Cola. That is why customers buy Red Hat
Linux rather than El Cheapo Linux. That is why Apache servers
dominate the Web, rather than servers based on generic copies of
the Apache code.</p><p>And that is why, if you are wise in selecting, perfecting and
using your trademarks and service marks, you can protect the market
for your free and open-source software products from competitors
who merely want to copy your work and make money off your
well-earned goodwill.</p><p>In future articles, I will describe how you should select a
good trademark and explain what you need to do to use it and
protect it properly.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and to the law in your
jurisdiction. Even though an attorney wrote this article, the
information in this article must not be relied upon as a substitute
for obtaining specific legal advice from a licensed
attorney.</p></div></div>
