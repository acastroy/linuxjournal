    Linux takes over the world, one step at a time&mdash;with smaller
    footprints and larger funding.

pounds and walks at over one mile per hour. Not only that, Isamu
climbs up and down stairs, carries four-pound objects in its
handlike grippers, and even recognizes human faces via its
dual-camera stereo vision system. Isamu also has a brain, which
consists of a dual-Pentium embedded computer running RTLinux.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4890f4.jpg"></div>

</p><p>Isamu is the product of a joint project of the University of
Tokyo's Jouhou System Kougaku Laboratory (JSK Lab) and the Aircraft
and Mechanical Systems Division of Kawada Industries, Inc. (Tokyo,
Japan). The goal of the project is to develop testbeds for research
on &ldquo;human interactive motion control technology&rdquo;. For example,
Kawada Industries plans to explore possible commercial applications
in markets such as construction systems, disaster relief, aids for
the disabled, rehabilitation and training devices, and
amusement.</p><p>In order to mimic humanlike movement, Isamu has thirty-five
degrees of freedom: six for each leg, one for each foot (a toe
joint), seven for each arm, one for each gripper, two for the neck
and three for the eyes. The on-board computer, equipped with dual
750MHz Pentium III processors running RTLinux, provides real-time
servo and balance compensation, and coordinates the robot's 3-D
vision and motion-planning software modules.</p><p>Thanks to an ample battery pack, a wireless Ethernet
interface and the powerful on-board computer, Isamu can operate
without the need for external cables or constant human
intervention. A joystick can be used to direct the robot's
movements when human control is desired.</p><p>Isamu's bipedal walk, control-system software was developed
by the JSK Lab, while the hardware and robotics structures,
including the servo-based, level control system, were developed by
Kawada Industries. Kawada applied aircraft technologies to the body
frame, resulting in a strong and light structure. Visit the JSK
Lab's web site

where you can view some amazing videos showing some of the things
Isamu can do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263a580.0x2732978"></a>Linux Upgrade for the Palm III</h2></div></div><p>Empower Technologies has announced what it calls &ldquo;the
world's first major operating system upgrade for Palm IIIx and
IIIxe handhelds&rdquo;. A preliminary demo version of Linux DA is
available for free download from the company's web site. Although
the demo version is limited to only the most basic PDA functions
(address, schedule, calculator, notepad and a few games), the
commercial version will add functions such as web browsing, e-mail,
multimedia and a lot more. The company says its Linux DA was
derived from the standard Linux kernel, with the addition of
homegrown software for a GUI, database, power management, boot
loader, Flash loader, data sync, IrDA and PIM functions. See

Investment, Launches</h2></div></div><p>XOE Device Platform
</p><p>Transvirtual Technologies, Inc. has closed a
four-million-dollar funding round and is using much of the new
capital to launch a new Java/XML-based information appliance
platform, called eXtensible Operating Environment (XOE). XOE
(pronounced &ldquo;zo' ee&rdquo;) evolved Transvirtual's PocketLinux
Linux/Java environment for handheld computers, along with a number
of XML-based client and server functions. The result, according to
Transvirtual, is &ldquo;a faster, cheaper and more flexible solution
specifically engineered for small, resource-constrained information
appliances such as PDAs, web-enabled mobile phones, automotive
telematics and TV settop boxes&rdquo;. Although initially targeted to
embedded Linux-based devices, XOE will eventually support other
embedded OSes as well. See
<a href="http://www.transvirtual.com" target="_self">transvirtual.com</a>
for details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263a580.0x2732c90"></a>Linux in 27 &times; 27mm</h2></div></div><p>Axis Communications, maker of the ETRAX system-on-chip, has
integrated over 50 components into a multichip module (MCM) in a
standard 27 &times; 27mm PBGA IC package. Axis says just two
external components are needed to end up with a fully functional
Linux system: a 20MHz crystal and a source of 3.3 V power. The new
MCM contains Axis' ETRAX 100LX RISC-based system-on-chip processor,
plus all the most common components normally put in designs based
on the device, such as DRAM, Flash, an Ethernet transceiver and
&ldquo;glue&rdquo; components. Axis says it has run Linux and a small
application program successfully, entirely within the MCM's
built-in 2MB Flash and 8MB SDRAM. A development board and sample
schematics of typical applications for the device are available.
Samples are expected in this month. Pricing has yet to be finalized
but is expected to be in the range of $50 US (10K units) to $75
(single units). See
