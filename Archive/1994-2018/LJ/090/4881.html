    Using Linux and Samba for research on extremely small lasers
    called VCSELs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e3a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux and Samba recently answered the
needs of the Army Research Lab (ARL) at Adelphi, Maryland. Our
branch does state-of-the-art research into a specific type of
lasers and amasses large amounts of data during the performance
testing of these devices. We were able to connect our test
equipment over the network to a Samba server. The twist to this
approach is that our configuration makes it appear to the users
that they access the data through the branch's NT fileserver. I'll
explain the setup in detail, but the main trick is creating a
network shortcut on the NT box to point to the Samba share while
making the Linux box invisible on the network. Figure 1 depicts the
setup of the network.

</p><p>Our branch develops extremely small lasers called VCSELs
(vertical-cavity, surface-emitting lasers), which fall under the
general category of photonics research. We easily can put over 60
lasers into a square millimeter, and the full wafer containing the
lasers can be three inches in diameter. Therefore, we can have
thousands of devices on a single wafer. Figure 2 shows a picture of
a typical VCSEL. The main tests we run to characterize the
performance of each VCSEL are called ILV curves for current, light
and voltage. Basically, we see how much light comes out for the
power that was put in. Also, most of the analysis software is on
the user's desktop machine so they need to be able to access the
raw data from there. Users are creatures of habit. Getting data
pertinent to the branch has historically meant going to the NT
server. Since the users were used to getting data from the NT box,
we did not want to make them go somewhere else. We tried to make
everything transparent to the user and make it appear as though
they were getting the data from the NT server. To force the users
to go through the NT box, we make the Linux box invisible to the
network. We rely on the security of the NT box to authenticate
users accessing the data.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4881f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

First is the probe station that is basically just a microscope with
some tiny probes and a light meter. The probes apply the power to
the device, and we measure the power produced with the light meter.
A 4155B parameter analyzer from Agilent is the second piece of
equipment. This analyzer is programmed to sweep the current level
and measure the voltage and light. It has two main ways of being
controlled: front panel and the GPIB interface. Granted, the GPIB
port is a popular scientific interface and allows us to do fancier
tests by controlling the test setup with a computer as well as
collect the data, but our controlling computer is about five feet
down the lab bench and cannot be moved closer. This makes it
difficult to start the test when the probes are in place.
Fortunately our main test is simple to program through the front
panel. Our test routine is to position the probes by looking
through the eyepiece of the microscope, reach up carefully and push
the test button on the parameter analyzer and then save the data.
Figure 3 shows the lab hardware.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4881f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e41b8"></a>Operation</h2></div></div><p>After we get a clean run, we need to save the data. The 4155B
has three ways to save the data: GPIB, floppy and TCP/IP. Since we
aren't controlling the analyzer with the GPIB, that's not an
option. The floppy supports 3.5" disks, but these disks fill up
quickly and you have to walk around with them. Since we have
several lab areas where we work, it's not unheard of to have to
backtrack to recover a temporarily misplaced disk. The answer we
put together works because of the TCP/IP support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e42c0"></a>Linux</h2></div></div><p>The parameter analyzer supports TCP/IP, specifically NFS. You
can even ping the analyzer. Since it's registered in the lab's DNS,
the ping can be done by way of IP address or name. We were able to
put together a Linux box out of obsolete or broken equipment.
Literally, we pulled together parts of three computers into one. It
didn't cost the government anything, and it fills the need. For the
installation, the newest distribution that we had and that the
P-133 hardware would support is Red Hat 6.2, so we put that on and
hardened it with Bastille and the latest patches. Additionally, all
the unnecessary services were turned off and SSH was added. We
sliced the hard drive space carefully and ended up with about 1.5GB
of space for data. Total time of install and configuration was
three hours.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e43c8"></a>NFS</h2></div></div><p>Again, the parameter analyzer talks NFS, so the next step was
configuring that. The /etc/exports file needed just one
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/guest/hptestdata 192.168.10.29(rw)
</pre><p>The hptestdata directory was created under guest's home
directory, and nfsd was restarted. This line allows only the one IP
address to mount the directory. Appropriate information was entered
into the parameter analyzer's front panel and the mount button
pushed. Of course it didn't work the first time. After just a
minute of diagnosis, syncing the ID numbers on the analyzer to the
guest account solved the problem. Total time to configure NFS was
less than five minutes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e4580"></a>Samba</h2></div></div><p>Samba is an amazing product that can do many things. This is
a simple application, and the /etc/smb.conf is shown in Listing
1.</p><p><a href="4881l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
/etc/smb.conf</a></p><p>Of course, crucial security information like network domain
has been changed in this and /etc/exports. The key parts in the
file are creating the hptestdata share and making it read-only. The
read-only part is to prevent users from accidentally deleting data.
We periodically purge, but only after assurances from all the
users. The other part of Samba is modifying the boot-up files so
nmbd is killed. With the network configuration we are setting up,
we don't want to see the machine on the network. Therefore we don't
want nmbd to provide name services. See your distribution's
documentation for the appropriate file to configure. For Red Hat
6.2, we modified S91smb and commented out the nmbd startup lines by
placing a # at the beginning of the appropriate lines. To remind
myself of this network configuration, I also changed the echo line
in the file to say that smbd was not starting. Normally the script
will output that nmbd is starting. Access is restricted to our
domain only so outside access is prevented. Total time to configure
was several hours of tweaking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e4790"></a>NT Setup</h2></div></div><p>The final configuration step was on the NT box. We haven't
seen this trick anywhere else so we think it's pretty neat. We
created a data share for the Linux machine. This is where the users
will go for data from their desktops. Then we made a network
shortcut using UNC (universal naming convention) and put it into
the data share. To be honest, to do this we made the Samba share
visible on the network for just a minute and created a shortcut in
the directory. It was easier for us to do that than fight getting
the double backslashes correct. When the user accesses the NT
server, he or she sees the shared folder. Double-clicking there
shows a directory. Double-clicking on the directory brings the user
to the Linux box with the test data, without realizing it. This
trick is necessary because Windows cannot share out a network drive
that it has mounted. My original plan was to have the NT box map
the Samba share to a drive and then share that out. Total time to
configure was five minutes, after realizing that Windows can't
share out a mapped drive and we employed this trick.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e4898"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Linux and Samba filled a requirement of the lab that couldn't
be supported otherwise. The method is transparent to the users
because they go to the same central place for data; it's as secure
as the branch's NT server, and it was literally built for free
since we used 100% scavenged equipment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11eb580.0x12e49a0"></a>Future</h2></div></div><p>This scheme still suffers slightly from security. A savvy
computer user could look at the properties of the network shortcut
and then use that to make a shortcut directly to the Samba server,
bypassing the NT security. An alternative would be to use the Linux
box and smbmount to mount a share from the NT server and export
that using NFS to the test device. We were able to mount the NT
share on the Linux box, export that with NFS and then mount that on
the 4155B. The problem still remaining is writing to that share,
even using options with smbmount. Hopefully, in the near future we
will have some time to tackle this aspect again.</p><p><a href="4881s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
