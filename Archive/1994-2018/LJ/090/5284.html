out to be pretty exciting, what with articles on wind tunnels and
lasers. We thought we'd put some nice destructive lasers burning
through steel (or space shuttles) on our cover, but Brian
Gollsneider at the Army Research Lab at Adelphi, Maryland informed
me that the lasers with which they work have an 850nm wavelength
intended for communication purposes only and are outside the range
of human visibility. Being a &ldquo;journal&rdquo;, we like to keep our
covers realistic and article-related (remember the little man
inside the computer on the February 2001 issue?). So we went with
the skier.
</p><p>As Marcel Gagn&eacute; reminds us in his column this month,
engineers have traditionally been conceived as people who drive
trains (hence the notion of chemical engineers as those who take
drugs and drive trains). But as this month's articles show, most
engineers seem to have abandoned internal combustion and moved to
other types of engines. Rick Lehrbaum reveals Isamu, a robot with
remarkably humanoid abilities for movement. The project is a joint
venture between the University of Tokyo's Jouhou System Kougaku
(JSK) Laboratory and the Aircraft and Mechanical Systems Division
of Kawada Industries, Inc. Professor Hirochika Inoue heads the JSK
Lab, and his views are among those of the many roboticists featured
in the book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robo-Sapiens</em></span>, which documents
current robotic projects around the world and speculates as to the
future of robo-human relations.</p><p>There seems to be three schools of thought among roboticists
concerning this future: robots will surpass humans in intelligence
and ability, robots will never approach humans or humans themselves
will become increasingly robotic.</p><p>One particularly impressive project highlighted in the book
is DB (Dynamic Brain) of the Kawato Dynamic Brain Project at
Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute near Kyoto, Japan.
The DB robot is used by neurophysicists who work with the robot to
learn more about the functioning of the human brain. The scary
thing about DB is it learns, not through programming, but by
watching and mimicking the movements of humans. It's already
learned to balance objects and juggle better than its instructors.
There is one glimmer of hope however, at the book's press time, it
still couldn't dance very well.</p><p>If the future should bring robots superior to humans, let's
hope they run Linux&mdash;perhaps running open-source software will make
them more inclined to share the earth with their inferior humanoid
cousins.</p></div></div>
