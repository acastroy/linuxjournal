In the real world, things don't always work out as you hoped.
That's what exit codes are for&mdash;letting you know when things went wrong.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc86580.0xd7e3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we looked at signals, the rudimentary mechanism that processes
on a Linux box can use to communicate events and state changes. We talked
about how each of the signals can be sent manually to a running process
with the kill command, and how shell scripts then can catch and
respond to specific signals (though not all of them&mdash;some cannot be
caught because they're actually handled by the operating system itself).
</p><p>
Analogous to signals, exit codes turn out to be an easy way for processes
to communicate state back to the calling parent process, in a way that
most Linux users just ignore. Not anymore&mdash;this month, we're going to
take a closer look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc86580.0xd7e618"></a>
mv Exit Codes</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with a simple Linux command that everyone's probably already
mastered: mv, which moves a file or directory from one spot in the
filesystem to another (and/or renames it).
</p><p>
As you know, you can generate errors if the target is missing, destination
is missing and so on. Here's quick example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mv missing ~/missing2
mv: cannot move `missing' to `.../missing2': No such file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
You see an error; obviously, it didn't work. Ah, but behind the scenes,
a numeric &ldquo;return code&rdquo; variable has been set in the shell too,
something you can test and respond to within a shell script. Check out this
sequence:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $?
0
$ mv missing ~/missing2
mv: cannot move `missing' to `.../missing2': No such file or directory
$ echo $?
1
$ echo test me
test me
$ echo $?
0
</pre>
</p><p>
If no error occurs when executing a command, the exit code
(which we reference in the shell with the shorthand <tt  >$?</tt>) will have the value of 0: no error.
Now, if I run a command that fails, the exit code will have a nonzero value.
In the case of the failing mv command above, the error code will have the value of 1.
And, if I now run yet another command, one which runs without error, the error code is reset to zero.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a peek at the mv man page, paying particular
attention to the latter part of the doc. Close examination reveals:
&ldquo;The mv utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
occurs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That's not so interesting, really. The grep command has more interesting
diagnostics, actually:
&ldquo;Normally, exit status is 0 if selected lines are found and 1 otherwise.
But the exit status is 2 if an error occurred, unless the -q or --quiet
or --silent option is used and a selected line is found.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There is a set of system exit codes that are defined, although
it's possible you'll never need the information. Here's a list of the codes
and their meanings:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1: general errors
</p></li><li><p>
2: misuse of shell builtins (pretty rare)
</p></li><li><p>
126: cannot invoke requested command
</p></li><li><p>
127: command not found error
</p></li><li><p>
128: invalid argument to &ldquo;exit&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
128+n: fatal error signal &ldquo;n&rdquo; (for example, kill -9 = 137).
</p></li><li><p>
130: script terminated by Ctrl-C
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'd never actually seen this list until I started digging into the issue
of exit codes, so you can continue on your merry shell-scripting
path safely without worrying about the data above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc86580.0xd7f220"></a>
Utilizing Exit Codes</h2></div></div><p>
The most common situation in which you analyze and respond to an exit
code is in error handling in a script.
</p><p>
Here's a simple snippet where you want to create a directory. If it
fails, you want to output an error message and quit:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
mkdir /usr
echo \$? = $?
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
  echo "mkdir /usr failed: we have an exit code of $?"
  exit 1
fi
echo "made the requested directory. Why is '/' world writable?"
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out, there's a nuance to working with the $? that I've
already alluded to&mdash;one that makes output statements like the first
&ldquo;echo&rdquo; quite problematic. You can see why in the output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test.sh
mkdir: /usr: File exists
$? = 1
made the requested directory. Why is '/' world writable?
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see what happened? The exit code = 1 immediately after the mkdir,
which makes sense as /usr already exists, but when we again test the
exit code in the conditional, it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a nonzero value!
</p><p>
Why? Because at that point, it indicates the exit code of the echo
statement, not the mkdir command. Oops.
</p><p>
You can verify this simply by commenting out the first echo statement,
in which case you now see this as the command output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ !.
./test.sh
mkdir: /usr: File exists
mkdir /usr failed: we have an exit code of 0
</pre>
</p><p>
That makes more sense, doesn't it?
</p><p>
Because this can be tricky, a common thing I see in really bulletproof
shell scripts with lots of error handling is something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
mkdir /usr
error=$?
if [ $error -ne 0 ] ; then
  echo "mkdir /usr failed: we have an exit code of $error"
  exit 1
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
This is one instance where a local variable to hold a system or global
variable makes a lot of sense, and it also lets you do things like have an
error message show up on-screen <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> be handed off to something like syslog()
to ensure that the admin sees it at some point.
</p><p>
Of course, error handling doesn't always just need to print a message
and exit. Another scenario might be the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alternates='
   http://www.example.com/test.pdf
   http://www.example2.com/test.pdf
   http://www.example3.com/test.pdf
   '
gotit=0
for file in $alternates
do
  wget $file
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Unable to get $file
  else
    gotit=1
    break
  fi
done
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we try to retrieve a file from one of multiple alternate locations
and exit the loop only when we succeed (or when we've run out of possibilities).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc86580.0xd7fab8"></a>
Hiding Error Messages</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know how to capture and analyze the exit codes from system
commands, what if you want to have the error message be one from your script,
not one from the command itself?
</p><p>
That's done with another new shorthand notation:
<tt  >&gt;&amp;</tt>, which
redirects the stderr/error output stream. Here's how I use that to hide
all error messages from the mkdir command being used in our sample
scripts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkdir /usr &gt;&amp; /dev/null

</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use <tt  >&amp;&gt;</tt>
or <tt  >2&gt;&amp;1</tt> instead of <tt  >&gt;&amp;</tt>.
</p><p>
If you don't test the results of the command, of course, you 
seriously can hose things up, but this makes the output more elegant for sure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test.sh
mkdir /usr failed: we have an exit code of 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Hmmm...I'm still getting that false 0. Oh! I haven't added the
code to save the exit code value as &ldquo;error&rdquo;.
One slight tweak later and:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test.sh
mkdir /usr failed: we have an exit code of 1
</pre>
</p><p>
That's more like it!
</p><p>
I'm going to call this a wrap for this month. Next month, I'll
demonstrate how the exit command lets you send exit codes back to
the calling program from procedures and functions, just as if they were
separate Linux commands rather than part of the same shell script.
