New boots, new bootloaders&mdash;both take some time to get used
to. In this column, find out all the uncomfortable changes in the new
GRUB2 bootloader.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125b580.0x1353408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A few months ago, I had to replace my favorite pair of shoes: black, suede Converse One Stars (the classic style with no white rubber toe
cap, thank you). I had worn the shoes for years, but although most of the
shoe held up fine, I had completely worn down the heel. Now, I'm not one
to throw away a comfortable pair of shoes. This pair was on its
ninth or tenth Shoe-Goo repair, but it finally became hopeless.
They had to be replaced. It seemed like a simple task&mdash;after all, these shoes had been available all through my adult life, but
wouldn't you know, the moment I need another pair, Converse discontinued
the model and replaced it with a canvas version with the Chuck Taylor-esque
white rubber toe. I had to find a new shoe.
</p><p>
Let me tell you, once you have found the perfect sneaker, it's impossible
to find a replacement. Everything I looked at was held up to the standard
of the shoe I couldn't have. After a month or two, I finally found shoes
that were up to the task, and although I like them, I still miss my old shoes
(oh, wouldn't you know it, now that I bought a replacement, Converse
has re-released the One Stars how I like them).
</p><p>
I really should be used to this feeling. It seems every few years some
open-source project decides to throw away an entire codebase and start
from scratch. Although GNOME and KDE have stirred the pot the most with
this,
I've also lived through the same thing with the Enlightenment Project,
the SysV init to Upstart transition, the LILO bootloader being phased
out for GRUB, and now GRUB being replaced by GRUB2. For those of you who
thought the difference between GRUB2 and GRUB1 was &ldquo;one&rdquo;, you are: good
at subtraction, a bit of a smart aleck and in for a rude awakening. In
this article, I'm going to help you break in your new GRUB2 bootloader, 
so hopefully some day, it will be as comfortable to you as the original GRUB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125b580.0x13536c8"></a>
Why?</h2></div></div><p>
The first question you might ask is why we need a new bootloader
at all? What is wrong with GRUB? The answer, according to the GRUB2
developers, is that the original GRUB codebase was rather old and had
become unmaintainable. The software continued to get new feature requests
(such as supporting new hardware and platforms) that ultimately were
beyond the scope of the original code, so the decision was made to scrap
it and start from scratch. Because it was a complete rewrite, the developers
decided to take the opportunity to make a clean break and redesign the
layout and syntax of the configuration files. Along with these changes,
GRUB2 has been able to add new features, such as a rescue mode, enhanced
graphical menu and splash screen support, full support for UUIDs, and
support for non-x86 platforms, such as PowerPC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125b580.0x1353828"></a>
Old Boots</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into how GRUB2 has changed things, I'm going to give a quick
overview of GRUB1 (or GRUB Legacy, as they are calling it now) to help
highlight the changes for those of you who might be unfamiliar with
either bootloader. GRUB (and LILO before it) has been the standard
bootloader used by the majority of Linux distributions. When you boot
your computer and see a menu that lets you choose between different
Linux kernels, or between different versions of Linux and Windows in a
dual-boot scenario, you probably are using GRUB. GRUB's job is to allow
you to choose between one or more operating systems at boot time and
then either load the respective kernel and initrd into memory and start
the rest of the boot process, or launch the boot code for some
other operating system, such as Windows.
</p><p>
GRUB is quite configurable and organizes itself into a few core programs
and directories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/boot/grub/menu.lst: this is the default configuration
file for GRUB, although on some distributions it is a symlink to
/boot/grub/grub.conf. All of GRUB's configuration is in this file, and
users edit this file directly to change any GRUB options.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/grub: this is the core GRUB binary that you can use (if
you learned all of the syntax) to install GRUB onto your system. The
syntax is a bit tricky though, so ultimately, other programs appeared
to help automate the process.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/grub-install: this program acts as the front end to
/usr/sbin/grub and makes it much simpler to install GRUB to your hard
drive.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/update-grub: this script helps automate configuration
of the menu.lst file. Instead of having to add new kernels to
menu.lst manually, you can run this script, and it will detect kernels available
on your system and build the menu.lst for you. In addition, this script
can read special configuration options in the comments of menu.lst and
further automate the process of providing rescue modes, memtest86+
and other customizations of the file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Another great feature of GRUB is the fact that even with all of this
configuration, if you make a mistake, GRUB allows you to change essentially
any configuration option from the boot prompt. At the GRUB menu, you can
press the Esc key to change boot options on the fly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125b580.0x1353cf8"></a>
New Boots</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have learned (or refreshed your memory) about GRUB, you may
promptly forget it, because much of what I said above has changed. For
starters (and this will drive you crazy), the default key to edit GRUB2
options at boot is Shift, not Esc. Second, the main configuration file
has been changed from /boot/grub/menu.lst to /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Not
only has the filename changed, but also the syntax inside the file is quite
different from what you'd find in menu.lst.
</p><p>
While I'm on the subject of syntax changes, a crucial syntax change that
GRUB2 makes is in how it numbers partitions. Where in GRUB your partitions
were counted starting from zero, now the count starts with one. To
make it more confusing, disk devices still are being counted starting
from zero. Confused yet? In short:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GRUB1: <tt  >/dev/sda1 = (hd0,0)</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
GRUB2: <tt  >/dev/sda1 = (hd0,1)</tt>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Here's a sample stanza from GRUB's menu.lst and a similar stanza from
GRUB2's grub.cfg, so you can compare their syntax:
</p><p>
GRUB:


<pre     class="programlisting">
title    Ubuntu karmic (development branch), kernel 2.6.31-14-generic
uuid     c7b6836f-ac57-47ed-9e7c-b16adbf8abed
kernel   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root=UUID=
         &#8618;c7b6836f-ac57-47ed-9e7c-b16adbf8abed ro quiet splash
initrd   /boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic
quiet
</pre>
</p><p>
GRUB2:


<pre     class="programlisting">
menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.31-20-generic' --class ubuntu 
 &#8618;--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
        recordfail
        insmod ext2
        set root='(hd0,2)'
        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 
        &#8618;c7b6836f-ac57-47ed-9e7c-b16adbf8abed
        linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-20-generic 
        &#8618;root=UUID=c7b6836f-ac57-47ed-9e7c-b16adbf8abed 
        &#8618;ro   quiet splash
        initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-20-generic
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Before you sit down and study the new syntax, I should point out that
you are actively discouraged from editing grub.cfg directly. This file
is generated from a series of scripts and configuration files I will
talk about later, so any changes you make will be overwritten the
next time any package updates that would trigger the GRUB2 update.
</p><p>
Like with GRUB, here are the core files and programs involved in GRUB2
configuration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/boot/grub/grub.cfg: this is the core GRUB2 configuration file but
is not to be edited directly.
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/default/grub: this is the main configuration file for end
users to edit. In this file, you can configure a limited subset of GRUB2
options, such as timeouts, basic kernel boot options and whether to use
a graphical console or UUIDs. Every time you make a change to this file,
you must run <tt  >/usr/sbin/update-grub</tt> for the changes to be reflected. Here
are some sample lines from the file to give you some idea of the syntax:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2&gt; /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/grub.d/: this directory contains a series of scripts that
are executed in numerical order by the grub-mkconfig program and will
configure different parts of grub.cfg. On a default Ubuntu Lucid install,
for instance, you would find the following files:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /etc/grub.d/
00_header        10_linux       30_os-prober  README
05_debian_theme  20_memtest86+  40_custom
</pre>
</p><p>
The order in which configuration options appear in grub.cfg is governed
by the order its script appears in this directory. So if, for instance,
you wanted to have a different OS appear before the Linux options in the
menu, you could name the script 01_otheros. Although the scripts that are
currently there do a few complicated things, essentially your script
needs to output the configuration information you want in the proper
grub.cfg syntax, so I suppose it even could be a series of echo statements
in a shell script. If you want to create a custom configuration script
though, Ubuntu has provided the 40_custom script for you to use that
will not risk being overwritten.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/grub-install: like with GRUB, the GRUB2 grub-install program
is the recommended way to install GRUB2 onto a device. It calls a number
of other scripts that perform various system checks, device probes and
everything else that's necessary to install GRUB2 to a boot device.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/update-grub: this script still exists and is still
the recommended way to update GRUB2's configuration file, but now this
is a very short shell script that executes grub-mkconfig. Whenever you
edit a configuration file or script, run this command with no arguments
to rebuild the grub.cfg file.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig: this program does the real heavy-lifting
to build your grub.cfg file. It is the program that executes the various
scripts in /etc/grub.d.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In addition to the above changes, here are a few extra things that are
different in GRUB2:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GRUB2 no longer has stage 1.5 in the boot process.
</p></li><li><p>
On a new Ubuntu install when no other OSes are present, GRUB2 will
not display a menu at boot time and will instead boot directly into the
Ubuntu install.
</p></li><li><p>
To reiterate, hold Shift instead of Esc to change GRUB2 boot options.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you are like I was when I first discovered all of these changes, right
about now you are feeling like the ground has been moved out from under you. I
felt much like I did when I couldn't buy a new pair of black suede One
Stars. All I can hope for is that over time, like my new shoes, the
uncomfortable parts of GRUB2 will break in, and I will feel comfortable
with them and maybe some day even like them as much as GRUB1.
