Create a Debian Repository for Your System</h2></div></div><p>
If you have a Debian-based system, once you've got everything installed,
you can create a Debian repository from it and use that repository
for installing additional similarly configured systems, or you can use it
as a source for a re-install in the event that your system somehow
becomes corrupted.
</p><p>
To do this, install the package dpkg-dev. You can install it with apt-get
from the command line, or you can install it using a GUI package manager,
such as Synaptic.
</p><p>
Now, create a directory&mdash;for example, my_repo. This will be the root of your
repository. Under this, create a directory named binary.
Next, copy all the .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives/ into the
binary directory.
Then, go to the my_repo directory, and run the command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dpkg-scanpackages binary /dev/null | gzip -9c &gt; binary/Packages.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates your packages list.
After that, save the whole my_repo directory onto another system. 
Then, change the /etc/apt/sources.list file, and add the path of the my_repo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
deb file:///home/boss/my_repo binary/
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, reload the repository list and check your new repository.

Auto-Typing and Mouse Movements</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes you may need to type the same thing repeatedly, whether it's filling out a form or typing a common word or phrase over
and over again. There is a simple program for Linux called xte that
allows you to control virtual key presses and mouse gestures that are
sent to a program. xte is part of the xautomation package. It should
be available through your package manager.
For Debian-based systems, you can run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo aptitude install xautomation
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the package is downloaded and installed, you can use xte
from the command line, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xte 'sleep 5' 'str hello world'
</pre>
</p><p>
This command waits five seconds and then types the string &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo; into whatever application has focus. You not only can send
strings, but you also can send key presses. So, let's say you want to
send the key press for Enter, after you send the string &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo;.
Simply do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xte 'sleep 5' 'str hello world' 'key Return'
</pre>
</p><p>
There are a number of keys that can be sent using xte. Some
modifier keys include Shift_L, Shift_R, Ctrl_L and Ctrl_R. As
you can see, xte not only can send a Ctrl key press, but it also can
distinguish between left and right Ctrl key presses. This is
important, because some programs have different functions for the left and
right Ctrl keys.
</p><p>
When typing the command for these key presses, keep in mind that
the commands are case-sensitive. For instance, <tt  >key
Return</tt> will work, but <tt  >key
return</tt> will not. Use the <tt  >xte --help</tt> command to get a full list of
useful keys that you can send.
</p><p>
You can use xte for many useful things.
Let's say you
type your name, or maybe the name of your company, a lot throughout the
day. You easily can create a script with xte that will send the
string of information and then link that script to a set of shortcut
keys for your desktop environment. So, instead of typing out
&ldquo;Johnson, Joseph and Jack's Law Office&rdquo;, you simply can press
Ctrl-Alt-N, and the script will type it for you.
</p><p>
I also use xte for was controlling Compiz on the
touchscreen in my car. Without a mouse or keyboard, I was unable to
use some of Compiz's useful features, such as scaling. So, after
setting scaling to be controlled by moving the cursor to the top-right
corner of the screen, I added an icon to the GNOME toolbar that ran a
script that did the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xte 'sleep 1' 'mousemove 9999 0'
</pre>
</p><p>
The first number (9999) is the X-axis value, and the second
(0) is the Y-axis value. This command waits one second, which allows me to
lift my finger from the touchscreen before the cursor moves, and then
relocates the mouse cursor to the far right of the screen and up to
the very top. Now, in combination with my Compiz settings, I can press
the icon on my toolbar and get a nice view of all my open windows. I
click the one I want, and I'm off and running. This makes touchscreen
usage much more convenient and raises the cool factor a bit.
</p><p>
xte has many options I haven't touched on here (such as mouse clicks and
holding a key or a mouse press for a given amount of time). I hope it
has sparked an interest in you to give it a try and play with some.
It just may be the tool you need to get a job done.

Three Steps to Find Your Total Download Bandwidth Usage</h2></div></div><p>
I have been working on bandwidth-monitoring of late, and I find the
following three steps handy to find my download byte count.
These steps use iptables, which is available with
almost all distributions. It most likely already will be installed
on your system (it is the basic firewall in Linux).
</p><p>
Steps one and two set up the monitoring, and step three allows you to
view your download byte count.
The first two steps need to be done only once (at boot time, if you
want this available all the time).
You need to run all the steps as root.
</p><p>
Step 1: create a chain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ iptables -N input_accounting
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an iptables chain named input_accounting.
</p><p>
Step 2: add a rule:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ iptables -I INPUT -j input_accounting
</pre>
</p><p>
This causes all incoming packets to &ldquo;pass through&rdquo; your newly created chain.
</p><p>
Step 3: start checking your bandwidth:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ iptables -L -v | \
		grep input_accounting | \
		grep anywhere | \
       	awk '{ printf("%s\n", $2) }'
</pre>
</p><p>
This should output your download byte count&mdash;for example,
&ldquo;500K&rdquo;.
