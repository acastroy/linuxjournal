Zmanda Recovery Manager makes it easy to dump your database and
that homegrown backup solution you've been using and meaning
to replace.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d5f2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I had a chance to test the community edition of Zmanda Recovery
Manager for MySQL. I was partly testing to make sure it worked with
MariaDB, Monty Program's drop-in replacement for MySQL, but I also
was testing to see whether it would work well for our own database backups.
</p><p>
Monty Program has arguably the most in-depth knowledge of the MySQL
codebase on the planet. But apart from some large servers we use for
performance and other testing, our actual database usage and needs are
similar to many other small- to medium-size companies. For our Web sites,
we need only a couple small database servers. The datasets for each
database are not large, a couple hundred megabytes each. But, we still
don't want to lose any of it, so backups are a must.
</p><p>
I've long used a homegrown set of shell scripts to manage backing up our
databases. They're simple and work well enough to get the job done. They
lack some features that I've never gotten around to implementing, such as
automated retention periods and easy restores. The setup process also
is more involved than I would prefer. They get the job done, but I've always
wanted something a little better, and I've never had the time to
do it myself.
</p><p>
This is where Zmanda Recovery Manager for MySQL enters the picture. ZRM
Enterprise edition was reviewed by Alolita Sharma in the September
2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but I'm never very interested in
Enterprise editions. They always have proprietary bits, and I've never
trusted GUI tools as much as their command-line counterparts. Luckily,
where there is an &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; version there almost always is a
&ldquo;community&rdquo; version lurking somewhere in the shadows.
</p><p>
Like many other community editions, Zmanda Recovery Manager for
MySQL, Community Edition (let's just call it ZRM) lacks the
&ldquo;flashy bits&rdquo;. Things like the graphical
&ldquo;console&rdquo; application,
Windows compatibility, 24x7 support and other high-profile features
of its Enterprise sibling are missing in the Community version. But the
essentials are there, and it has one big feature I like: it is fully
open source (GPL v2). The key metric, however, is does it do what I need
it to do?
</p><p>
To find out, I set up a small test environment (I didn't want to test
on live, production databases) and gave it a spin. See the 
Setting Up a Test Environment sidebar for details on what I did prior to
installing and testing ZRM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d5f828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Setting Up a Test Environment</b></p><p>
For testing and evaluating ZRM, I set up three virtual servers running Ubuntu 10.04
LTS, installed MariaDB on them, and then downloaded the example
&ldquo;employees&rdquo;
test database from <a href="http://launchpad.net/test-db" target="_self">launchpad.net/test-db</a>.
</p><p>
Installing MariaDB is easy on Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS because of some MariaDB
repositories maintained by OurDelta.org. The site has instructions on how to
configure your system to use the repositories. For Ubuntu 10.04, I did the
following:
</p><p>
1. Added the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# MariaDB OurDelta repository for Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid Lynx"
deb http://mirror.ourdelta.org/deb lucid mariadb-ourdelta
deb-src http://mirror.ourdelta.org/deb lucid mariadb-ourdelta
</pre>
</p><p>
2. Added the repository key to apt:


<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-key adv --recv-keys \
            --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 3EA4DFD8A29A9ED6
</pre>
</p><p>
3. Updated apt and installed mariadb-server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get update
apt-get install mariadb-server
</pre>
</p><p>
Installing mariadb-server looks and acts just like installing mysql-server.
</p><p>
With the database server installed, I loaded the test database. To load the
employees test database into MariaDB, I first downloaded and untarred it and then
used the mysql command-line program to load it into MariaDB like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tar -jxvf employees_db-full-1.0.6.tar.bz2
cd employees_db/
mysql -u root -p -t &lt; employees.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
The employees test database uses a couple hundred megabytes of disk space. This is
in line with the size of our &ldquo;real&rdquo; databases. But more important than the comparative
size, the employees test database comes with a handy verification script
that
lets me test that the data is correct. Verifying the data is as simple as this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mysql -u root -p -t &lt; test_employees_sha.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
With the test database servers set up, I then created a fourth virtual
machine with a base Ubuntu Server install on it to act as my backup
server. Now I was ready to test using ZRM for backup and recovery with
the ability to verify that the recovery was successful.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d60068"></a>
Installing and Using ZRM</h2></div></div><p>
Zmanda offers packages for Debian, RPM and Solaris/OpenSolaris systems
and their derivatives on its Web site. A source package
also is available. Because I'm using Ubuntu 10.04, I downloaded the latest stable
Debian package (mysql-zrm_2.2.0_all.deb at the time of this writing) from the ZRM
download page.
</p><p>
ZRM requires the libxml-parser-perl and libdbi-perl packages, the
mariadb-client or mysql-client package, and something that allows it
to send e-mail messages (for notifying the correct people of a backup's
success or failure).
If you are running ZRM on the same server as your database,
the Perl and client packages likely already will be installed.
If you elect to do what I did and run ZRM from a dedicated backup server,
these will need to be installed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install libxml-parser-perl libdbi-perl \
                mariadb-client bsd-mailx
</pre>
</p><p>
When mailx is installed on Ubuntu, it also will install postfix (unless you
already have a different MTA installed), but other MTAs (mail transport
agents) may be the default on your distribution. During the installation
of the postfix package, I chose the basic &ldquo;Internet site&rdquo; setting, which
provides just enough of a configuration to allow the server to send e-mail.
</p><p>
The ZRM package expects a user named &ldquo;mysql&rdquo; to exist. This
user typically is
created when MySQL or MariaDB is installed, but because my backup
server has only the mariadb-client package installed, the mysql user
didn't exist, so I needed to create it. I also chose to give the new
user the same home directory that the user would have had if the user
had been created as part of an Ubuntu mariadb-server installation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo adduser --system --group --home="/var/lib/mysql" mysql
</pre>
</p><p>
With dependencies finally out of the way, I was ready to install
Zmanda Recovery Manager. I installed it like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dpkg -i mysql-zrm_2.2.0_all.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
The installation itself is pretty boring, and it looks no different from
any other package install:


<pre     class="programlisting">
me@backuphost:~$ sudo dpkg -i mysql-zrm_2.2.0_all.deb
Selecting previously deselected package mysql-zrm.
(Reading database ...
    42938 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking mysql-zrm (from mysql-zrm_2.2.0_all.deb) ...
Setting up mysql-zrm (2.2.0) ...
Updating ownership of previously backed up data sets

Processing triggers for man-db ...
me@backuphost:~$
</pre>
</p><p>
So what did the package install? A look at the output of <tt  >dpkg -L
mysql-zrm</tt> reveals that the package installs several Perl scripts into
the /usr/bin/ folder and creates the following directories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/usr/share/mysql-zrm &mdash; a &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; folder with several
Perl scripts inside.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/share/doc/mysql-zrm &mdash; various docs and README files.
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/lib/mysql-zrm &mdash; various Perl modules.
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/mysql-zrm &mdash; configuration files.
</p></li><li><p>
/var/log/mysql-zrm &mdash; empty directory for log files.
</p></li><li><p>
/var/lib/mysql-zrm &mdash; the folder where backups go (initially empty).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The package also installs man pages for the scripts and config files,
and xinetd and logrotate config files.
</p><p>
Now I was ready to set up some backups. ZRM uses the concept of &ldquo;backup
sets&rdquo; to refer to backup settings for a single server or backup job. To
create a new backup set, you create a new directory under /etc/mysql-zrm/
and copy the default configuration file into the new directory, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /etc/mysql-zrm
mkdir -v backupsetname
cp -vi mysql-zrm.conf backupsetname/
</pre>
</p><p>
The folder can have any name you want. The mysql-zrm.conf file is, by
default, completely commented out. The file has inline documentation
for each configuration directive, and it is pretty easy to read. For my
project, I wanted compressed and encrypted logical backups, so the lines
I customized and uncommented were these:


<pre     class="programlisting">
backup-mode=logical
backup-type=regular
retention-policy=30D
compress=1
compress-plugin=/bin/gzip
encrypt=1
encrypt-plugin="/usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins/encrypt.pl"
all-databases=1
user="backup-user"
password="examplepassword"
host="db1.example.org"
mailto="my-email@example.org"
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >user</tt> and <tt  >password</tt> in the set of variables above is a MariaDB
database user, not a system user. This user is created like other database
users using the mysql command-line tool and a GRANT statement. Here's
the GRANT statement Zmanda recommends:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GRANT select, show view, create view, insert, update,
      create, drop, reload, shutdown, alter, super, lock tables,
      replication client
          on *.*
          to 'backup-user'@'backuphost'
          identified by 'examplepassword';
</pre>
</p><p>
If you set up ZRM on the host it is backing up,
<tt  >backuphost</tt>
in the above statement would be changed to <tt  >localhost</tt>. At this
point, I also needed to configure one of our database servers to allow
remote logins. This is done by setting the bind-address variable in the
/etc/mysql/my.cnf file to the IP address of the database server and then
restarting mysqld.
</p><p>
Backups can be either &ldquo;raw&rdquo; or
&ldquo;logical&rdquo;. Raw backups are actual copies of
the database files. Logical backups are a dump (using mysqldump) of the
contents of your database in SQL. Raw backups can be restored only to a
server running the same version of MariaDB or MySQL. Logical backups do
not have this restriction and can be loaded successfully onto servers
running older or newer MariaDB/MySQL versions (depending on whether
the new server to which you're restoring supports the same features that the old
one did).
</p><p>
Backup types are &ldquo;regular&rdquo; and &ldquo;quick&rdquo;. The quick type applies
only to raw backups and only if your database is stored on an LVM logical
volume. A raw+regular backup is a copy of your MariaDB/MySQL data files
made using mysqlhotcopy. A raw+quick backup is an LVM snapshot of those
data files. If you are doing a logical backup, the quick backup type is
not available.
</p><p>
The retention-policy variable tells ZRM how long you want to keep
backups. The default is 10W, which stands for ten weeks. Other suffixes
you can specify include D for days, M for months or Y for years.
</p><p>
ZRM uses &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; to extend its functionality. Several plugins come
with ZRM, including a couple that can be used to copy backups from a
remote database server to the server running ZRM, and a plugin to encrypt
backups. Some plugins are just wrapper scripts, like the encryption
plugin, which is a wrapper around GPG. Other plugins are just system
binaries. For example, the default &ldquo;compress&rdquo; plugin is just the gzip
program, no wrapper script required. Any or all of these can be replaced
with your own preferred solutions.
</p><p>
Configuration and setup varies per plugin. The encryption plugin,
for example, requires the creation of a file named .passphrase in
the /etc/mysql-zrm/ folder. This file contains the password used when
encrypting backups. The steps I followed when creating this file are:


<pre     class="programlisting">
touch /etc/mysql-zrm/.passphrase
echo 'mysupercoolhardtoguesspassword' &gt; /etc/mysql-zrm/.passphrase
chmod -v 700 /etc/mysql-zrm/.passphrase
</pre>
</p><p>
Furthermore, because the encryption plugin uses GPG, the .gnupg folder
needs to be present in the root user's home directory (the backups are
spawned by root). It wasn't present for me, so I created it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -v /root/.gnupg
chmod -v 600 /root/.gnupg
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I was ready to perform some backups. Running a manual backup is
pretty easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql-zrm-scheduler --backup-set backupsetname \
                    --backup-level 0 --now
</pre>
</p><p>
Scheduling backups also is easy. Like running a manual backup, to schedule
backups, you use the mysql-zrm-scheduler script, but instead of having
the backup start &ldquo;now&rdquo; you set an interval and a start time, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mysql-zrm-scheduler --add --backup-set backupsetname \
                         --backup-level 0 \
                         --interval daily --start-time 01:00
</pre>
</p><p>
The above backup will run every day starting at 1am. You can view
the schedule with <tt  >mysql-zrm-scheduler --query</tt>, or
because ZRM schedules
backups using cron, you simply can query the root crontab with
<tt  >crontab -l</tt>
(running the command as root).
</p><p>
When you add your first schedule, ZRM also will add a cronjob for running
the &ldquo;purge&rdquo; action for removing backups that are older than the retention
period.
</p><p>
To check that your backup data hasn't been corrupted since the backup
was made, use the mysql-zrm script with the
<tt  >verify-backup</tt> action:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql-zrm --action verify-backup --backup-set backupsetname
</pre>
</p><p>
To view stats on recent backups, the mysql-zrm-reporter can help:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql-zrm-reporter --show backup-performance-info
</pre>
</p><p>
If disaster strikes and you need to restore a backup to a server, the
first thing is to determine the location of the most recent successful
backup, and then to use it. The mysql-zrm-reporter script is an easy
way to reveal the location:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql-zrm-reporter --show restore-info \
                   --where backup-set=backupsetname
</pre>
</p><p>
In the output, look for the backup_directory of the most recent backup
where the backup_status is &ldquo;Backup succeeded&rdquo;. The backup_directory path
will look something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/var/lib/mysql-zrm/backupsetname/20100607141122
</pre>
</p><p>
With this information, you can perform a restore, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
backup_dir=/var/lib/mysql-zrm/backupsetname/20100607141122
mysql-zrm-restore --backup-set backupsetname \
                  --source-directory $backup_dir
</pre>
</p><p>
Expect restores to take a while, depending on the size of your database. In
my testing setup, after the restore completed, I verified the data as
described in the Setting up a Test Environment sidebar, and everything
checked out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x215a1a8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
At the end of my evaluation, I decided to use ZRM for our database
backups. My use case is logical backups over the network, and for those,
the Open Source community edition of ZRM works very well.
</p><p>
I like how easy scheduling new backups and creating new backup jobs
is. With Zmanda, I can configure backups for a new database server
effortlessly, something that could not be said about my homegrown
solution. Restores also are easy, which will be appreciated if the
unthinkable happens and I need to restore from a backup. And, thanks
to ZRM's use of standard tools, even if I can't restore using ZRM,
the backup contains a file that I can load into the database manually
either as-is (if I'm not encrypting or compressing my backups) or after
a little processing using the standard gunzip and GPG tools.
</p><p>
Zmanda Recovery Manager for MySQL is not perfect. During my testing, I
was never able to get raw backups working properly over the network,
for example. Another issue, though minor, is that the man pages have
formatting issues that make them hard to read. Some of the error
messages are not the most informative as well, and the documentation
could be improved and expanded. But, the software is built using solid
open-source tools, it doesn't try to re-invent the wheel at every turn,
and it works for the backups I want to do.
</p><p>
In the end, the thing that tipped the scales for me was that ZRM offers
several things that my homegrown scripts do not. These include 
automatically creating a checksum for verifying that a backup is still
good, faster and very customizable setup for new database servers, and
easy restores. I could add all of these to my scripts, given time. But
it's time I don't have at the moment, and I never seem to have enough (if
you know where to find some, let me know). So despite some rough edges,
I've found Zmanda Recovery Manager for MySQL, Community Edition to be
a good backup solution for all my MariaDB servers.
