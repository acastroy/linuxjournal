If you need a high-speed storage or caching system that provides
everything memcached does and then some, take
a look at Redis.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1896580.0x198e358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few months, I've been covering non-relational
databases, sometimes known as NoSQL databases. To hard-core NoSQL
proponents, relational databases are no longer the be-all and end-all
of data storage. Rather, NoSQL systems, which offer flexibility, easy
replication and storage using modern data structures, are the way of
the future&mdash;and perhaps even of the present.
</p><p>
Most NoSQL adherents aren't quite this extreme, but instead point to
NoSQL as a useful solution to relatively new problems, such as those
faced by Web sites with massive loads. To them (and me), NoSQL
databases offer the storage equivalent of a new data structure. You
could build programs with nothing more than integers, strings and
arrays, but with the addition of hash tables to your arsenal, your
code becomes easier to write and maintain. In the same way, having
an additional storage mechanism can improve the quality, efficiency
and maintainability of your software.
</p><p>
NoSQL is a catchphrase that has caught on like wildfire in the past
year or two, but it's a problematic phrase in that it describes what
these databases are not, rather than what they are. And indeed, 
many different types of NoSQL databases exist. Two that I
have explored in this column during the past few months are MongoDB and
CouchDB. Both of these are &ldquo;document&rdquo; databases&mdash;they store
collections of name-value pairs, much like a Ruby hash or a Python
dictionary.
</p><p>
A different type of NoSQL database is the
key-value store. Whereas
you can think of a document database as containing multiple hash
tables, a key-value store is the equivalent of a single hash table.
As you can tell by its name, a key-value store allows for the storage
of a single value (which might be an aggregate data structure, such as
an array or hash table), identified by a single key.
</p><p>
Whether a document database or a key-value store is more appropriate
for your application depends greatly on your needs. I recently
rewrote part of my PhD dissertation software, which previously
had used PostgreSQL for all back-end storage, to use a combination of
PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I chose MongoDB because I will need to
retrieve documents using a variety of fields and combinations of
fields. A single key for each document would have been insufficient.
</p><p>
In another case, a financial application on which I have been
working, I needed fast access to the latest exchange rates for a
number of currency pairs. Because I was going to be retrieving
data based only on a single, unique key (that is, the six-letter
representation of a currency pair), using a document database would
result in unnecessary overhead. All I was interested in doing was
storing the current exchange rate for a currency pair or retrieving
the current rate for that pair, a perfect match for a key-value store.
</p><p>
So, I spent some time investigating key-value stores and decided to
use Redis, an open-source key-value store originally developed by
Salvatore Sanfilippo, an Italian programmer who was hired by VMware to
work on Redis full-time. Redis was released in February 2009, but it 
quickly has attracted a large following, in no small part because of its
amazing speed.
</p><p>
In many ways, Redis resembles memcached, another key-value store that
is popular for scaling Web applications. Like memcached, Redis stores
keys and values in RAM. Like memcached, Redis is extremely fast.
Like memcached, Redis has bindings and clients written in a large
number of languages.
</p><p>
However, there are significant differences. Redis can store and
manipulate a large number of data structures (such as lists, sets and
hashes). Redis stores values in RAM but writes them out to disk,
asynchronously, on a regular basis. This means if someone pulls
the plug on your computer, you will lose only the items you added
since the last time Redis saved. Everything else will be read into
RAM and made available in the usual way when you next bring up Redis.
</p><p>
And, have I mentioned that Redis is fast? It's not uncommon to hear
people talk about getting tens of thousands of reads and writes per
second with Redis.

Downloading and Installing</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I have described Redis, let's try to install it. On most
modern Linux distributions, you should be able to install Redis (often
as the package redis-server) via apt-get or yum. However, pay
attention to the version number. My Linux
server running Ubuntu 9.10 happily installed a very old version of
Redis for me. I uninstalled it and downloaded it from the Redis
home page (see Resources).
</p><p>
If you download the source code, you might be surprised to discover
that there is no configure script. Rather, you just run
<tt  >make</tt> to
compile Redis. Once it's done, you can install the programs 
(especially redis-server) manually into an appropriate directory, such as
/usr/local/bin. Don't forget to install redis.conf, the Redis
configuration file, in an appropriate place, such as /etc. To get
things started, say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/bin/redis-server /etc/redis.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Redis to start up and read its configuration from
/etc/redis.conf. The configuration file is easy to read and modify,
and you should take a look at it when you have a chance. If you're
interested in just starting to work with Redis and don't care about
fiddling with the controls, you can do that. The default
configuration works just fine for most basic purposes.
</p><p>
The configuration setting that probably is of greatest interest is
&ldquo;daemonize&rdquo;, which indicates whether Redis should put itself into the
background. I kept Redis in the foreground (and with debug-level
logging active) when I first started to use it, but when I finally put
it into production, I turned on daemonize, so I wouldn't
receive a large number of log and update messages while the system was
in use.
</p><p>
The other configuration setting indicates how often Redis should save
its state to disk. The default configuration parameters that came
with my installation look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
</pre>
</p><p>
This means Redis should save its state every 900 seconds if there
has been one change, every 300 seconds if there have been ten changes,
and every 60 seconds if there have been 10,000 changes. Redis saves
to disk asynchronously, so there's no danger of it slowing down
substantially when it performs the save operation.
</p><p>
You can change these settings according to your particular
application's needs, striking an appropriate balance between how much
data you're willing to lose if the server goes down and the need for
high performance. A separate program, redis-benchmark, comes with
Redis, and it allows you to get a sense of how many reads and writes you
can expect to execute per second on your specific hardware, with the
configuration options you have put in place.
</p><p>
By default, Redis listens on port 6379. You can connect to it locally
via telnet or by using the redis-cli program that comes along with
it, which lets you interact with the Redis server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1896580.0x198ee00"></a>
Working with Redis</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a Redis server, how do you work with it? One simple
way is to use the command-line interface, which comes as a program
called redis-cli. If you prefer, you can use a programming
language instead, which hides the protocol behind a set of objects and methods,
but most of the libraries I have seen use the same method names
as the underlying Redis protocol.
</p><p>
The two most basic commands in Redis are GET and SET, which
retrieve and set values. SET takes two parameters, a key and a
value, while GET takes a single parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; GET name
(nil)
redis&gt; SET name reuven
OK
redis&gt; GET name
reuven
redis&gt; GET Name
(nil)
</pre>
</p><p>
From this example, you can see several things. First, Redis will
return a nil value if you retrieve a key that has not been set.
Second, keys are case-sensitive, so &ldquo;name&rdquo; is different
from &ldquo;Name&rdquo;. This might be important if you use names or e-mail
addresses as the keys in your Redis database, so be careful! Finally,
you can see that Redis stores everything as a string, at least when
you're storing things in this way, so you don't need to put quotes
around your values, unless they contain quotes.
</p><p>
The nature of the protocol means that your keys may not contain space
characters. I read somewhere that this restriction may be lifted at
some point. Nevertheless, for compatibility with older versions of
Redis, you might want to remain conservative in your key-naming
conventions. Other than that, you are free to use any character you
want in your keys and values.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1896580.0x198f118"></a>
Additional Features</h2></div></div><p>
If this were all Redis could do, you might think of it as a
super-memcached that saves its state to disk on a regular basis.
After all, memcached also is a key-value store that keeps data in RAM
and is extremely fast.
</p><p>
However, Redis offers a number of features on the server that go
beyond what memcached offers. For example, there is the setnx
command, which sets a new value for a particular key, but only if the
value does not yet exist. In other words, this is a test-and-set
feature, allowing you to be confident you are not overwriting
existing, and important, data. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; setnx name Kermit
(integer) 0
redis&gt; get name
reuven
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can ask Redis to increment and decrement counters for you. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; set counter 10
OK
redis&gt; incr counter
(integer) 11
redis&gt; incr counter
(integer) 12
redis&gt; decr counter
(integer) 11
redis&gt; decr counter
(integer) 10
</pre>
</p><p>
Redis also provides a rich set to begin with; it allows you to store and
manipulate lists. Lists are stored and retrieved using a separate set
of commands from GET and SET, which confused me when I first began
to use it, but it has become somewhat more natural over time. You
can create, add members to and remove members from a list with a few
simple commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; lpush atflist first
OK
redis&gt; lpush atflist next
OK
redis&gt; rpush atflist last
OK
redis&gt; lrange atflist 0 -1
1. next
2. first
3. last
redis&gt; lindex atflist 2
last
</pre>
</p><p>
The lpush and rpush commands add an element to a list (or create
the list, if it doesn't yet exist) on the left or right side,
respectively. They are similar to the lpop and rpop commands, which
remove an element from the stated side of the list. The lrange
command allows you to list all the elements of the list from a
particular index and until another index. If you give -1 as the ending
index, you get the entire list returned to you. Finally, you can
retrieve the element at a particular index with lindex.
</p><p>
Although it might not be obvious at this point,
Redis is strictly typed.
This means trying to retrieve a list as a scalar value, or vice
versa, will result in an error:


<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; get atflist
(error) ERR Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
redis&gt; lpush name lerner
(error) ERR Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
</pre>
</p><p>
Thus, it's important, when working with Redis, to remember what the
type is of each key-value pair.
</p><p>
Related to lists, but with a distinct purpose, are sets. You add items
to a set with <tt  >sadd</tt>, get a list of members with
<tt  >smembers</tt> and find
the length (&ldquo;cardinality&rdquo;) of the set with
<tt  >scard</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
redis&gt; sadd children atara
(integer) 1
redis&gt; smembers children
1. atara
redis&gt; sadd children shikma
(integer) 1
redis&gt; sadd children amotz
(integer) 1
redis&gt; smembers children
1. amotz
2. shikma
3. atara
redis&gt; sadd children amotz
(integer) 0
redis&gt; scard children
(integer) 3
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see from the above example, adding an element to a set
normally results in a response of 1, indicating that the element was
added. However, each element of a set must be unique within the set;
no duplication is allowed. If you try to re-add an element that
already exists in the set, Redis responses with 0, indicating that the
element did not need to be added. As with all other parts of Redis,
sets are case-sensitive, so if you try to add the same name, but
with a different capitalization, the operation will succeed.
</p><p>
Redis provides facilities for working with sets, such as union and
intersection. One possible use for this would be in social tags on a
Web site. Each URL could be the name of a set, and the set could
contain all the social tags applied to that URL. You then could find
which tags have been applied to two different URLs without having
to retrieve and compute this on your own, at the application level.
</p><p>
Redis also provides sorted sets, which are identical to the sets you
have seen until now, but they keep the items in a specific order (or
&ldquo;rank&rdquo;) that can be modified.
</p><p>
The most recent versions of Redis now support
hash tables.
(By the time you read this, Redis 2.0 likely will have been released,
with complete support for such functionality.) This might seem a bit
strange, given that you can think of Redis as a large hash table, but
it means you can store multiple hash tables within Redis. The
hash-table functions all begin with an h and provide the same sorts
of setting, getting and testing functionality that you have seen for
the main Redis storage mechanism.
</p><p>
Finally, the latest version also provides &ldquo;multi-exec&rdquo; functionality,
allowing you to execute multiple commands within a single atomic
operation. This is not quite the same as transactions as you know them
from relational databases, but it goes a long way toward such
functionality, making Redis attractive not only for basic key-value
operations, but also for more complex ones.

Is Redis Good for Everyone?</h2></div></div><p>
I looked at Redis after having read numerous rave reviews, and
I was expecting to find serious problems with it. To date, I haven't found
any. Indeed, I find myself among its excited proponents. That said, I
have grown to enjoy working with Redis because I'm using it in places
where it is appropriate. I can handle the loss of data stored since
the most recent checkpoint. The data I am storing fits into
Redis' data structures quite easily, and the data I am storing
fits within my server's available RAM. In addition, there is an
excellent Ruby library for working with Redis, which 
allows me to integrate it into my work seamlessly and easily.
</p><p>
That said, Redis isn't a good match for everyone. If you are storing
multilevel hash tables, or if you cannot afford to lose even a
moment's data when the server goes down, or if you want to have the
data replicated across master servers (as opposed to master-slave,
which Redis handles easily), you might want to look at a
different solution, such as Cassandra. But I have been impressed and
delighted with Redis in my work so far, and from what I can tell, I'm
not the only one who feels this way.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
If you need a high-speed storage or caching system that provides
everything memcached does and then some, you probably should take
a look at Redis. It is easy to install, high performance, and it has
client libraries in every major programming language. Redis has been
in production use with numerous applications, including many Web
sites, for more than a year, and its users continue to rave about its
functionality and performance. Even if you don't need a key-value
store right now, it might be worth installing and playing with Redis.
I wouldn't be surprised if after a few minutes of experimentation, you
will think of some uses for it you hadn't considered previously.
