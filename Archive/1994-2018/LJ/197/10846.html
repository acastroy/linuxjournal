Ever since the early 1990s, we've been stuck on the Web like a fly visiting a
spider. Of course, for us, the Web is a useful medium for information
delivery, and no giant spider is coming to eat us (depending on the
Web sites we visit, I suppose). Although our passion for the Web hasn't ebbed
during the past two decades, the Web itself has changed drastically. This
month,
we focus on Web development. It's exciting to see how integral the Linux
operating system is to the Internet, and as the Web changes, so does the way
we develop for it.
</p><p>
Behind most good Web applications, there is a database humming along providing
data to the user quickly and efficiently. Reuven M. Lerner shows us Redis, which
is a high-speed storage and caching system for databases. It's a bit like
memcached on steroids. Be sure to take a look if your database could use a
speed boost (and really, what database doesn't?). Thankfully, Daniel
Bartholomew follows Reuven with a one-two punch and gives us a review on
the Zmanda Recovery Manager. The fastest database in the world is useless if you
can't recover its data from a disaster, so you'll want to read Daniel's
article before going into production.
</p><p>
Although databases are important for any good Web application, for end users,
they're about as exciting as watching paint dry&mdash;that's where user interfaces
come in. Thankfully, many content management systems exist to do all the
heavy-lifting for us. Jerad Bitner and Nate Haug show off Drupal this month.
The LinuxJournal.com Web site runs Drupal, so we
can attest to how wonderful it is for managing large Web sites. Jerad and
Nate explain how Drupal can do the same for your Web site, and they provide some tips
and tricks to make it perform well regardless of how big your site might
become.
</p><p>
For many developers, simply managing content isn't what they need to
accomplish. In that case, we've given you a couple different ways to tackle
your specific problem. Paul Barry demonstrates how to use App Engine. App Engine
is a way to create webapps on Google's infrastructure, completely free.
(Well, if your webapp becomes extremely popular, Google will charge you, but
initially it's free, which is a price that's hard to beat.) Google's App
Engine is extremely flexible and constantly improving, and Paul shows the ins
and outs of this relatively new technology. If its newness or its Googliness
turns you off, perhaps Christopher Schultz's article on developing Web
applications with Java/JSP will be more what you're looking for in a platform.
Java has been around for a long time, but that doesn't mean it's
old-fashioned. Christopher shows how to make cutting-edge programs in a time-tested language.
</p><p>
Many of us aren't developers at all. I'm certainly not, and yet I still look
forward to the Web development issue because I can point my developer friends
at new ways to make my life as an end user more exciting. Rick Rogers, for
instance, walks through the process for developing portable Web applications
for Internet-enabled devices. Whether you use an Android phone or an iPad
tablet, or if you just prefer to run mobile apps on your computer (a little
user-agent trickery in your browser usually can help there), Rick's article is
one you'll want your developer friends to check out. A beautiful Web page is
great, but when you're looking at a three-inch screen, it's nice to have a viewing
experience designed for such small real estate.
</p><p>
Finally, this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. If this month's issue
focus isn't 
quite your cup of tea, we still have tons of stuff to feed
your Linux addiction. Kyle Rankin shows us the ropes with
GRUB2, a significant change from the GRUB we all know and love. Dave Taylor
teaches us about exit codes to help make our shell scripts a little smarter.
Mick Bauer continues his series on transparent firewalls. Even I get into the
act with some tips on starting a LUG in your area. Add to that our regular
lineup of tech tips, letters to the editor and new product
announcements, and you've got an issue bound to inform and entertain. The
great thing about Web development with Linux is that no matter how long you
stay tangled in this issue, no giant spider will come to eat you. We hope.
