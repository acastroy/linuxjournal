Create 3-D games using the keyboard or mouse as controllers.

I've been working with Blender 3-D for several years now, but I started 
playing with the game engine only recently. I've had a lot of fun with
it, and I'm sure you will as well. With the
Blender Game Engine (BGE), you can create 3-D games using the keyboard
or mouse as controllers. Your game can trigger events when objects
collide with each other or when they get within a certain distance from
each other. There is a built-in state engine, so that objects in your
game can change their behavior as required. Although there is a powerful
and well-documented Python API, we won't be using it today. In fact,
we won't be writing a single line of code!
</p><p>
In the April 2009 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I wrote an article 
demonstrating the Irrlicht 3-D engine by creating a basic 3-D environment
in less than 100 lines of C. In this article, I demonstrate the
BGE by creating a functional video game, complete with realistic physics,
and all I'm going to do is connect dots.
</p><p>
One of the biggest attractions of the BGE is the built-in Bullet
Physics Engine. The physics engine allows users to assign various
physical characteristics, such as mass, to objects in their blender
model and configure how they respond to collisions and movement.
When done properly, users end up with blocks that fall when dropped
and tumble when they collide. Balls roll down hill, and dominoes knock
each other down.
</p><p>
In order to demonstrate the important aspects of the BGE and the Bullet
Physics Engine, I've devised a little game that I affectionately call
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Super Mega Demolition Derby</em></span>. The premise of the game is simple; you build
walls and towers and such with various types of building materials.
Then, you drive a car through them and watch them crumble to pieces!
Okay, so I don't know how you'd actually go about keeping score in a game
like this, but games are supposed to be fun, and based on how much time
I've spent destroying block walls, I think this is a fun game.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows an action shot from one of the test animations I made
while playing the game. As you can see, the modeling and texturing
are very simplistic (this isn't meant to be a modeling tutorial).
I'm sure you can see that this is the classic &ldquo;drive a car over
a ramp and through a wall&rdquo; stunt. To set up this stunt, I created
three
stacks of blocks, stacked four high. I put the purple ball on top. Then, I
positioned a ramp in front of the wall and put the car a bit further out.
Once the lighting and camera angles were set up, I started the game and
drove the car up the ramp.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11046f1.large.jpg"><img src="11046f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The first step in creating the game is to create a model for all of the
various objects. The arena is simply a 100x100 plane. I then extruded
the edges to create a fence to prevent the car from driving off the
edge of the arena. The car was created from a cube that was scaled and
extruded to form a very basic car shape. The rest of the game objects
are fairly trivial.
</p><p>
Once the game objects are finished, it's time to start the game logic.
Because the car has both physical attributes and keyboard controls, it's
the most complicated, and this is where we'll start. Selecting the
car and pressing F4 brings up the Logic menu. The configuration I used
for the car is shown in Figure 2. Here you see three columns of controls.
The first column is where you configure the object's physical attributes,
which I discuss later. For now, let's take a look at the Sensors,
Controllers and Actuators columns.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11046f2.large.jpg"><img src="11046f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Logic Panel
</p></div></div><p>
The Sensors column is where you select to which events you are interested
in having your game object respond. In this case, you can see that
the car responds to the up, left and right arrow keys. The keyboard
sensor allows you to configure various parameters, such as repeat rates
and keyboard modifiers. Game objects also can respond to mouse events,
collisions, proximity to other objects, timers and messages sent from
other objects.
</p><p>
Sensors are connected to controllers, which function essentially as
filters and determine when a given sensor is of interest. As you can see,
I selected the boolean logic equivalent to &ldquo;always&rdquo; in determining
when the car should respond to keyboard events. I could have referenced
Python code or any of the 30 different game states if I had chosen to, but
that
just introduces more complexity than the game requires. The state
engine could have been used to introduce traps, puzzles and other hidden
elements to the game. Implementing actual intelligence probably
would have required some Python code.
</p><p>
The Actuators column is where the action comes from. Although I used
&ldquo;simple motion&rdquo; for the car's keyboard events, the possibilities
are a bit daunting at first. I had the option of changing the object's
location and rotation along the X, Y or Z axis. I also had the option
of applying a force or torque. Finally, I had the option of changing
the object's linear and angular velocities. By selecting the L
at the right, I told the BGE to use the object's Local orientation to
apply the motion changes, as opposed to using global coordinates.
</p><p>
Getting the car's handling to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; right took a bit of
tuning, and
as it is, it's still a bit more like driving in slick mud than driving
in a grassy arena. More tuning needs to be done before it's right.
On the other hand, I was able to use a material setting to add random
bumps to the driving surface that caused the car to bounce around a bit.
</p><p>
The BGE allows you to do more than just move objects around. You can
use actuators to make sounds, send messages to other objects, create
and destroy objects, change game state, change cameras or even start
an animation sequence. It is hard to come up with something that
can't be done with the actuators that the BGE provides. For example,
I've considered the possibility of creating a series of actuators that
destroy a box object and replace it with an identical-looking box that
has the &ldquo;Explode&rdquo; modifier applied to it. This would allow me to
create a box that explodes upon impact, but I've not tried it.
</p><p>
Now that you have a car you can drive around, you need to make it
and the other game objects behave according to the laws of physics.
This is done using the controls in the first column of the Logic panel in
Figure 2. The first thing you have to do is decide what type of object you
want, which essentially determines &ldquo;how many&rdquo; of the physical laws
apply to the object. You have several types from which to choose, including
static, dynamic, rigid body, soft body and sensor.
</p><p>
A static object responds to collisions, but it's not affected by gravity.
I configured the ramp as a static object, for example. This way, the
ramp would respond realistically if a car ran into it from behind, but
I could also &ldquo;stack&rdquo; ramps in otherwise impossible configurations in
order to build more complex obstacle courses.
</p><p>
Dynamic objects are just like static objects except that they're affected
by gravity. They are not subject to rolling physics. When I initially
set the car as dynamic, I found it didn't drive up the ramp as
I expected. It resembled more of an escalator ride to the top of the
ramp, because the car didn't tilt as it crossed the ramp.
</p><p>
When I configured my car to be a rigid body, I had everything. The car
would fly off the ramp, fall to the ground and roll if it hit too hard
or hit something on its way down. Most of the objects in the
game are configured as rigid bodies.
</p><p>
The soft body type was fun to play with. By tweaking various parameters,
I was able to come up with a giant beach ball that bounced and deformed
when dropped. By loosening things up a bit more, I ended up with
a giant ball of Jell-O, and who hasn't dreamed of driving a car through
a giant ball of lime Jell-O? I know I have. This is the type to use on
objects you want to deform upon impact.
</p><p>
A sensor is simply an object that can be used to trigger events but
doesn't necessarily need to have the entire laws of physics applied to it.
For example, a sensor could be used to spring a trap, release an enemy
or simply change the state of the game upon collision. In this game
example, a sensor object could be placed in the middle of a platform to
trigger an elevator to rise when the car is positioned properly
</p><p>
Once you've determined what type of object you want, it's time to tune
various parameters. For example, you can determine how much mass the
object has, which will determine if it falls like a feather or a
proverbial ton of lead, as well as how it behaves when it collides
with other objects. By clicking on the Advanced button, you 
also can set limits on how fast the object can move, among other things.
One of the most important things to tweak is the Bounds configuration.
This configuration determines how collision detection is done. I found
that if I used a spherical bounds for my car, things just didn't work
well&mdash;the car ended up rolling down the path to the ramp instead of
driving along.
</p><p>
You also can use the physics panel to assign various properties to an
object. For example, you might assign a &ldquo;damage&rdquo; property to the
car and assign an initial value of 0 to it. Then, for each collision,
you could create an actuator that increased this value. Finally, you
can use the property as a sensor and trigger an action when it exceeds
a certain value.
</p><p>
So, what do we have so far? Figure 3 is a screenshot of the game from
another camera angle&mdash;it's a car that can be driven around in
an environment that includes several different obstacles. This car
(as well as the obstacles in the game) has physical properties, such as
linear and angular momentum, mass and elasticity. All of these objects
behave as you would expect them to behave in a real-life situation.
</p><p>
From this, I'm expecting to create even more interesting objects for
the game. For example, I imagine that a very low mass object
like a playing card could be created easily. From that, a house of
cards could be constructed and subsequently destroyed. Dominoes, although
fun to watch, are so trivial to create, they're almost uninteresting.
In my opinion, beach balls and giant globs of Jell-O certainly warrant
further investigation.

</p></div></div><p>
By parenting the camera to the car, I've been able to devise a cockpit
view or a third-person view. Using this view, I could drive
around the arena just like any other driving simulation. The only
drawback was that once I drove the car through a wall, I wasn't able to
watch it tumble to the ground unless I quickly turned the car around.
It might be nice to set up several cameras, strategically place them in
the game and create keyboard triggers to select them. Still, this is
very easy to do with the BGE.
</p><p>
As you can see, the BGE is very powerful and doesn't require any
programing to get started. However, if you know or are willing to learn
Python, you can do a lot more interesting things. 
Tutorials on the Web demonstrate how to use Python code to create
projectile weapons, for example. I've already alluded to the idea of
using Python code to endow game objects with artificial intelligence.
The BGE Python API also is very well documented. In fact, the BGE is
the sole reason I've set out to learn Python.
</p><p>
As cool as it is, the BGE does have some limitations. Like Blender
itself, the BGE is extremely powerful, and although they're both well
documented, getting started can be a bit intimidating. The water and
cloth simulations don't function in the game engine. I also note that the
objects in this game don't cast shadows. I've not been able to figure
out how to fix that, yet. The biggest challenge I faced with the
BGE was the fact that object textures don't always seem to work the same
in the BGE as they do in the render engine. Obviously, because the BGE is
generating screen images in real time, some compromises have to be made.
I eventually got satisfactory results, but sometimes I had to resort
to UV mapping the texture onto the object to get it to work properly.
Maybe I'm missing something.
</p><p>
As you can see, the BGE and Bullet Physics Engine are extremely
powerful and configurable ways to create life-like game
environments quickly. My initial plan for this article was to use a simple flight
simulation as a demonstration. Once I started writing, I decided that
a flight simulation just didn't fully demonstrate the power of the BGE.
</p><p>
Other types of games are well suited to writing with
the BGE. For example, a billiards game is an obvious choice. Perhaps an
off-road or monster-truck-driving simulation would be fun. Not having
to write code in order to get game objects to behave intuitively means
you can concentrate on creating interesting games with realistic
content, and that is really cool.
