How to create an app to monitor processes in real time.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d4250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When was the last time you wanted to know the status of a command,
script or process when away from the computer? Wouldn't it be great to free
yourself from the office chair even though you are supposed to monitor
something? The key to making this happen lies in modern Web technology.
</p><p>
A Web application is just another term for an interactive Web
page. Mojolicious provides an excellent platform to launch a Web
application. Many smartphones are equipped with Web browsers capable of
consuming Web applications. Linux provides the best medium to bring 
both together.
</p><p>
Mojolicious is a shiny new Perl Web framework adapted from the technology
previously known as Catalyst. Mojolicious is an HTML5-compliant tool that
contains all the bells and whistles you would expect in a modern Web
framework. I love Perl, so naturally I was on it like a nerd on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span> paraphernalia (which I also probably would be on).
</p><p>
I won't go too far into the advantages of Mojolicious and Perl, but
I will mention that Perl has been known as the &ldquo;duct tape of the
Internet&rdquo;.
It is hard to go wrong with the tremendous amount of modules, free code and
support available.
</p><p>
I wanted something very basic to start this article. Luckily, Mojolicious
comes with template tools and standalone Web servers. This allows for
a very quick startup&mdash;no mucking around with Apache or anything like
that, until you are ready to scale up, that is.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d4670"></a>
Setup</h2></div></div><p>
First, you need to have Perl installed on your system. It should be
available in most repositories if it isn't installed by default.
</p><p>
Installing Mojolicious is as easy as typing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -L cpanmin.us | perl - Mojolicious
</pre>
</p><p>
This needs to be done as root. On Debian-based systems, like Ubuntu,
you would type it as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo -s 'curl -L cpanmin.us | perl - Mojolicious'
</pre>
</p><p>
That's all you need. Let's get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d4930"></a>
Up and Running</h2></div></div><p>
Some nice template tools are available in Mojolicious. For the
sake of this article, however, let's leave that for later. First, let's
create the simplest Mojolicious application possible by typing the
following into a file called gobble-first.pl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' =&gt; {text =&gt; 'This is just the beginning!'};
app-&gt;start;
</pre>
</p><p>
The first two lines source the Perl executable and Mojolicious module. The
third line prints a simple message when a browser hits the root URL. The
last line tells Mojolicious to start running.
</p><p>
Make the file executable by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 744 gobble-first.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, execute the file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./gobble-first daemon
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >daemon</tt> option tells Mojolicious to start the lightweight HTTP
server that comes packaged with the framework.
</p><p>
The command output that follows tells you Mojolicious is running on port
3000. Open a Web browser and point it to http://localhost:3000.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;!</em></span> You
now have a Web app running with four lines of code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d4da8"></a>
Having a Little Fun First</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's create a simple app that exhibits the power of Mojo. You can
use the built-in template tools to get started with as little typing as
possible. Enter the following on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mojo generate lite_app gobble-light.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates the file gobble-light.pl, containing the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/welcome' =&gt; sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;render('index');
};

app-&gt;start;
__DATA__

@@ index.html.ep
% layout 'default';
% title 'Welcome';
Welcome to Mojolicious!

@@ layouts/default.html.ep
&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= title %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;%= base_tag %&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;&lt;%= content %&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
There is some new stuff here. First is a <tt  >get</tt> statement just before
the <tt  >app-&gt;start;</tt> line. It instructs the server to accept requests at the
http://server-ip:3000/welcome URL. It also directs the users to a
document called index. The index happens to be within the same file
under the <tt  >__DATA__</tt> string. You can think of this section as containing
embedded files. In this case, there is an index.html file and layout
file called default.html. The .ep after each filename is just a
Perl naming convention for templates.
</p><p>
The important thing to note is you can insert Perl code into your
templates and layout with special strings like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

% perl code
&lt;% perl code %&gt;
&lt;%= perl code %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you were to execute this file and point your browser to
http://localhost/welcome, you would see the &ldquo;Welcome to
Mojolicious!&rdquo;
message.
</p><p>
This seems a little boring. Let's spice it up with a couple changes.
</p><p>
First, change the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get '/welcome' =&gt; sub {
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d53d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get '/(.me)' =&gt; sub {
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, add the following embedded Perl variable just after the &ldquo;Welcome
to Mojolicious&rdquo; text in the index.html.ep template:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;%= $me %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>

The full index template, just below the <tt  >__DATA__</tt>
line, now should 
look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@@ index.html.ep
% layout 'default';
% title 'Welcome';
Welcome to Mojolicious &lt;%= $me %&gt;!

</pre>
</p><p>
Run the new app the same way as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./gobble-light.pl daemon
</pre>
</p><p>
This time, point the browser on a phone to your Linux box. Add any text
after the path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http://server-ip:3000/jamie
http://server-ip:3000/foobar
http://server-ip:3000/blah
</pre>
</p><p>
The brand-new dynamic page adjusts according to the URL.

Figure 1. Pointing a BlackBerry Bold to My Server at
http://192.168.1.106:3000/blah
</p></div></div><p>
Why is this important? You're about to use this functionality in a
very useful way.
</p><p>
It is possible to have a full Web application in
just one Perl script. I
love this aspect of Mojolicious. I will keep expanding on the same
original file for the remainder of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28dc580.0x29d5c18"></a>
Some Mojo for Monitoring Applications</h2></div></div><p>
For sending command output to the Web application, it is necessary to
redirect all output to your Web service. This would be easy to do on
its own. However, it makes most sense to see the output both on
the originating terminal and your phone. The super-handy
<tt  >screen</tt>
command is perfect for this.
</p><p>
Screen is a session management tool. The most useful feature, in
regard to this application, is logging. A command can be run inside
screen. All output to the terminal seems normal. Yet, you can send the
output to a log file that can be accessed simultaneously by another
application. The other application in this example will be a second thread
of the
script.
</p><p>
Screen writes to the log file every ten seconds by default. I changed
this to every second. You can do that by adding the following
line to the .screenrc file in your home directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logfile flush 1
</pre>
</p><p>
I also added a line to customize the name of the log file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logfile html_gobble.log
</pre>
</p><p>
There also should be a control file in /etc/ if you don't or choose
not to have one in your home directory.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows all the code required to send command output to Mojolicious
and display it as a Web application.

Executing the program shown in Listing 1 would look something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./gobble-simple.pl here-i-am "sudo find / -mtime -66 -mtime +59"
</pre>
</p><p>
Here I am searching the entire filesystem for files that were modified
between 59 and 66 days ago. Notice that the <tt  >daemon</tt>
command-line option
is no longer required, because it was added to the
<tt  >app-&gt;start()</tt> call.
The output will go to:
http://myserver-ip/here-i-am.
</p><p>
Here is what is happening. The script begins by accepting two
arguments. The first is the URL to which the command will output. The second
is the actual command, which should be wrapped in parentheses.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10995f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Output of a find Command on the Nokia N97
</p></div></div><p>
You need two threads, one for screen at your terminal and the other
for Mojolicious and your Web app. When the command finishes, the first
thread is essentially done. I could kill the Web app at this
point; however, I like to browse the output afterward. So instead, I
print a little message to the terminal so I remember to kill the
process when I return.
</p><p>
The second thread opens the log file and formats each line into HTML.
Then, it stuffs all lines into a variable, which is passed to the
template below.
</p><p>
There are a couple things I don't like about this setup. First, you
have to press the refresh button on your phone's browser each time you
want to update the page. Second, each time the page refreshes, the
window starts at the top of the page. This isn't ideal if you have
lots of output to scroll through.

Adding JavaScript</h2></div></div><p>
To get some nice behavior from this little app, you need to add some
functionality on the client side. All updates here will go into the
template section as JavaScript. The following was added inside the
&lt;head&gt; tag, just below the title:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    background-color: #000000;
    color: #00ff00;
    font-weight: bolder;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/
&#8618;ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  $(document).ready(function () {
    %# Scroll down to the bottom
    $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(document).height()}, 
    &#8618;'slow');

    %# Schedule the first update in five seconds
    setTimeout("updatePage()",5000);
  });

  %# This function will update the page
  function updatePage () {

    $('#command-content').load(window.location.href + 
    &#8618;' #command-content&gt;div');
    $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(document).height()}, 
    &#8618;'slow');

    %# Schedule the next update in five seconds
    setTimeout("updatePage()",5000);
  }

&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
JavaScript is a language available in just about any browser. It is
the essence of Internet client-side scripting. I chose to use a fairly
popular helper library called jQuery to make things easier. The first
script tag imports this from Google's handy repository.
</p><p>
The second script tag contains the behavior code. jQuery is utilized
to scroll to the bottom of the page in a smooth, animated fashion. Next,
I call a function <tt  >updatePage</tt> to be executed in 5,000
milliseconds (five
seconds). This function first performs an AJAX call on the Web
application. It then replaces the current view with everything it found.
If there is no new content, the page would seem unchanged. If there is
new content, the page gets another nice animated scroll from the
current position to the bottom. Then, the same function is
called in five minutes. The browser keeps executing until it is closed or
redirected.
</p><p>
I felt it also was prudent to improve how the interface looked. Just
above the JavaScript code is some CSS styling rules that give things
some flavor&mdash;lime green on black is much easier to look at.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10995f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Going Modern with WebSockets</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, the tool is pretty much behaving how I want it.
I could, however, make a couple major improvements.
You may
have noticed that this is using a lot of unnecessary bandwidth. Every
five seconds, it grabs the entire contents of the page. This can really
add up&mdash;especially if you happen to forget the application running away
in your pocket. My short-term memory isn't that good, and neither is my
cell-phone plan.
</p><p>
The second flaw is the phone is doing most of the work. It
really should be the other way around. The server should be keeping track
of time and sending output without being requested. In fact, why should 
the entire document be sent if the phone needs only one or two lines?
</p><p>
Luckily, the modern Web has provided the fantastic new technology
called WebSockets. There is an initial handshake between the client
and server during connection, and then the connection stays open until one
of the two decides to close. This allows the phone to sit there,
listen and preserve battery power. New lines of content are sent when
available. No traffic is sent when the process completes. Therefore, you
don't need to worry about forgetting things in your pocket.
</p><p>
Start implementing this by setting up the WebSocket server. Add a Mojo
looping object at the start of the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $loop = Mojo::IOLoop-&gt;singleton;
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, add the following right before the
<tt  >app-&gt;start('daemon')</tt> string:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set the socket to be the same url...
# but with a "-ws" at the end.
websocket $my_url . '-ws' =&gt; sub {
  my $self = shift;

  my $send_data;
  $send_data = sub {
    # Grab new lines from our function
    my $new_lines = updatePage();

    # If new lines are available, $new_lines will exist.
    if ($new_lines) {

      # Send content to the client
      $self-&gt;send_message($new_lines);

      # Do this all again in 1 second
      $loop-&gt;timer(1, $send_data);
    }
  };
  # We need this to start our loop for the first time
  $send_data-&gt;();
};
</pre>
</p><p>
The app is so efficient now that I increased the update cycle to every
second. This is absolutely fantastic to witness in person. You really
get the feeling of monitoring output in real time.
</p><p>
The above code opens a WebSocket on the server. Next, an infinite loop is started
that sends output from the function called <tt  >updatePage()</tt>. The
function looks for new lines in the log file then formats them for
HTML. Here's what it looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">

sub updatePage () {
  open(FILE, "html_gobble.log");
    
  my $iteration_count = 0; # zero the counter
  my $new_content = ''; # Initialize the new content variable

  while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
    ++$iteration_count; # Increment
    # If there is a new line(s)
    if ($iteration_count &gt; $line_count) {
      # We need to keep track of lines already added.
      ++$line_count;

      # Here we are adding the current line to the new
      # content variable with our html markup around it.
      $new_content = $new_content . "&lt;div&gt;" . $_ . "&lt;/div&gt;";
    }
  }

  # Close the file handle.
  close (FILE);

  # Return new content
  return ($new_content);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
On the client side, you no longer need the AJAX and looping logic. You do
need WebSocket connection code though. The contents of the second &lt;script&gt;
tag from the previous example is replaced with this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  $(document).ready(function () {
    %# Grab our current location
    var ws_host = window.location.href;

    %# We are requesting websocket data...
    %# So change the http: part to ws:
    ws_host = ws_host.replace(/http:/,"ws:") + "-ws";
    %# I also tacked on the "-ws" at the end

    %# Connect the remote socket
    var socket = new WebSocket(ws_host);

    %# When we receive data from the websocket do the following
    %# with "msg" as the content.
    socket.onmessage = function (msg) {
      %# Append the new content to the end of our page
      $('#command-content').append(msg.data);

      %# Scroll down to the bottom
      $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: 
      &#8618;$(document).height()}, 'slow');
    }

    %# Scroll down to the bottom
    $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: 
    &#8618;$(document).height()}, 'slow');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The WebSocket URL is formed when the document initially is loaded.
A connection is made using the variable <tt  >socket</tt>. New content is appended
to the document when it is received, followed by an animated scroll.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10995f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Into the Wild</h2></div></div><p>
Only one thing is holding us back from sitting at a coffee shop
with our phones and calling it work&mdash;the firewall. Most processes I run
are fairly safe when it comes to output. I chose to follow a
security-by-obscurity philosophy. When I have a process running, other people can view
the output, assuming they know the port number and URL. When the process
