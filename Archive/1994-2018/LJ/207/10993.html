In recent years, the storage industry has been busy providing
some of the most advanced features to its customers, including
data deduplication. Data deduplication is a unique data
compression technique used to eliminate redundant data and decrease the total
capacities consumed on an enabled storage volume. A volume can refer to a
disk device, a partition or a grouped set of disk devices all represented
as single device. During the process of deduplication, redundant data is
deleted, leaving a single copy of the data to be stored on the storage
volume. 
</p><p>
One ideal use-case scenario is when multiple
copies of a large e-mail message are distributed and stored on a mail server. An
e-mail message the size of just a couple megabytes does not seem too bad, but
if it were
sent and forwarded to more than 100 recipients&mdash;that's
more than 200MB of copies of the same file(s). 
</p><p>
Another great
example is in the arena of host virtualization. In recent years,
virtualization has been the hottest trend in server administration. If
you are deploying multiple virtual guests across a network that may
share the same common operating system image, data deduplication 
significantly can reduce the total size of capacity consumed to a single
copy and, in turn, reference the differences when and where needed. 
</p><p>
Again,
the primary focus of this technology is to identify large sections of
data that can include entire files or large sections of files, which are
identical, and store only one copy of it. Other benefits include
reduced costs for additional capacities of storage equipment, which, in
turn, can be used to increase volume sizes or protect large numbers of
existing volumes (such as RAID, archivals and so on). Using less storage equipment
also leads to a reduced cost in energy, space and cooling.
</p><p>
Two types of data deduplication exist: post-process
and inline deduplication. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. To
summarize, post-process deduplication occurs after the data has been
written to the storage volume in a separate process. While you are
not losing performance in computing the necessary deduplication,
multiple copies of a single file will be written multiple times, until
post-process deduplication has completed, and this may become problematic
if the available capacity becomes low. During inline deduplication,
less storage is required, because all deduplication is handled in real time
as the data is written to the storage volume, although you will notice a
degradation in performance as the process attempts to identify redundant
copies of the data coming in.
</p><p>
Storage technology manufacturers have been providing the technology as
part of their proprietary and external storage solutions, but with Linux,
it also is possible to use the same technology on commodity and very
affordable hardware. The solutions provided by these storage technology
manufacturers are in some cases available only on the physical device
level (that is, the block level) and are able to work only with redundant streams
of data blocks as opposed to individual files, because the logic is unable
to recognize separate files over the most commonly used protocols, such
as SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre Channel, InfiniBand and even
Serial ATA (SATA). This is referred to as a chunking method. The filesystem
I cover here is Lessfs, a block-level-based deduplication
and FUSE-enabled Linux filesystem.

FUSE or Filesystem in USEr Space is a kernel module commonly seen
on UNIX-like operating systems, which provides the ability for users
to create their own filesystems without touching kernel code. It is
designed to run filesystem code in user space while the FUSE module
acts as a bridge for communication to the kernel interfaces.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x178f580.0x18877d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Note:</b></p><p>
In order to use these filesystems, it is required to install FUSE on the
system. Most mainstream Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Fedora,
most likely will have the module and userland tools already preinstalled,
most likely to support the ntfs-3g filesystem.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x178f580.0x18879e0"></a>
Lessfs</h2></div></div><p>
Lessfs is a high-performance inline data deduplication filesystem
written for Linux and is currently licensed under the GNU General Public
License version 3. It also supports LZO, QuickLZ and BZip compression (among
a couple others), and data encryption. At the time of this writing, the latest
stable version is 1.3.3.1, which can be downloaded from the SourceForge
project page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lessfs/files/lessfs" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/lessfs/files/lessfs</a>.
</p><p>
Before installing the lessfs package, make sure
you install all known dependencies for it. Some, if not most, of
these dependencies may be available in your distribution's package
repositories. You will need to install a few manually though, including mhash, tokyocabinet and fuse (if not already
installed).
</p><p>
Your distribution may have the libraries for mhash2 either
available or installed, but lessfs still requires mhash. This
also can be downloaded from SourceForge:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mhash/files/mhash" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/mhash/files/mhash</a>. At the
time of this writing,
the latest stable build is 0.9.9.9. Download, build and install the
package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xvzf mhash-0.9.9.9.tar.gz
$ cd mhash-0.9.9.9/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Lessfs also requires tokyocabinet (<a href="http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet" target="_self">1978th.net/tokyocabinet</a>),
as it is the main database on which it relies. The latest stable build is
1-4.47. To build tokyocabinet, you need to have zlib1g-dev and
libbz2-dev already installed, which usually are provided by most, if not
all, mainstream Linux distributions. 
</p><p>
Download, build and install the
package using the same <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >sudo make install</tt> commands
from earlier. On 32-bit systems, you need to append
<tt  >--enable-off64</tt>
to the configure command. Failure to use
<tt  >--enable-off64</tt> limits the
databases to a 2GB file size.
</p><p>
If it is not already installed or if you want to use the latest
and greatest stable build of FUSE, download it from 
SourceForge: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/fuse</a>. At
the time of this writing, the latest stable build is 2.8.5. Download, build
and install the package using the same <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >sudo make
install</tt> commands from earlier.
</p><p>
After resolving all the more obscure dependencies, you're ready
to build and install the lessfs package. Download, build and install the
package using the same <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >sudo make install</tt> commands
from earlier.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to go, but before you can do anything, some
preparation is needed. In the lessfs source directory, there is
a subdirectory called etc/, and in it is a configuration file. Copy the
configuration file to the system's /etc directory path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo cp etc/lessfs.cfg /etc/
</pre>
</p><p>
This file defines the location of the databases among a few other
details (which I discuss later in this article, but for now let's
concentrate on getting the filesystem up and running). You will need
to create the directory path for the file data (default is /data/dta) and
also for the metadata (default is /data/mta) for all file I/O operations
sent to/from the lessfs filesystem. Create the directory paths:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mkdir -p /data/{dta,mta}
</pre>
</p><p>
Initialize the databases in the directory paths with the mklessfs command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mklessfs -c /etc/lessfs.cfg
</pre>
</p><p>
The -c option is used to specify the path and name of the configuration
file. A man page does not exist for the command, but you still
can invoke the on-line menu with the -h command option. 
</p><p>
Now that the databases have been
initialized, you're ready to mount a lessfs-enabled filesystem. In
the following example, let's mount it to the /mnt path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
When mounted, the filesystem assumes the total capacity of the
filesystem to which it is being mounted. In my case, it is the filesystem
on /dev/sda1:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -t fuse.lessfs
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lessfs              5871080   3031812   2541028  55% /mnt

$ df -t ext4
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1           5871080   3031812   2541028  55% /
</pre>
</p><p>
Currently, you should see nothing but a hidden .lessfs subdirectory
when listing the contents of the newly mounted lessfs volume:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -a /mnt/
.  ..  .lessfs
</pre>
</p><p>
Once mounted, the lessfs volume can be unmounted like any other volume:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo umount /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's put the volume to the test. Writing
file data to a lessfs volume is no different from what it would be to any
other filesystem. In the example below, I'm using the dd command to
write approximately 100MB of all zeros to /mnt/test.dat:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test.dat bs=1M count=100
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
104857600 bytes (105 MB) copied, 5.05418 s, 20.7 MB/s
</pre>
</p><p>
Seeing how the filesystem is designed to eliminate all redundant copies
of data and being that a file filled with nothing but zeros qualifies
as a prime example of this, you can observe that only 48KB of capacity
was consumed, and that may just be nothing more than the necessary data
synchronized to the databases:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -t fuse.lessfs
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lessfs              5871080   3031860   2540980  55% /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
If you list a detailed listing of that same file in the lessfs-enabled
directory, it appears that all 100MB have been written. Utilizing
its embedded logic, lessfs reconstructs all data on the fly when
additional read and write operations are initiated to the file(s):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l
total 102400
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 104857600 2011-02-26 13:57 test.dat
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's work with something a bit more complex&mdash;something
containing
a lot of random data. For this example, I decided to download the latest
stable release candidate of the Linux kernel source from <a href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_self">www.kernel.org</a>,
but before I did, I listed the total capacity consumed available on
the lessfs volume as a reference point:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -t fuse.lessfs
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lessfs              5871080   3031896   2540944  55% /mnt

$ sudo wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
&#8618;testing/linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2
</pre>
</p><p>
Listing the contents, you can see that the package is approximately 75MB:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 74783787 2011-02-21 19:50 
 &#8618;linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2
</pre>
</p><p>
Listing the capacity used to store the Linux kernel source archive
yields a difference of roughly 75MB:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -t fuse.lessfs
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lessfs              5871080   3106440   2466400  56% /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's create a copy of the archived kernel source:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo cp linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2 linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2-bak

$ ls -l linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 74783787 2011-02-21 19:50 
 &#8618;linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 74783787 2011-02-26 14:43 
 &#8618;linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2-bak
</pre>
</p><p>
By having a redundant copy of the same file, an additional 44KB is
consumed&mdash;not nearly as much as an additional 75MB:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -t fuse.lessfs
Filesystem        1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lessfs              5871080   3106484   2466356  56% /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
And, because the databases contain the actual file and metadata, if
an accidental or intentional system reboot occurred, or if for whatever
reason you need to unmount the filesystem, the physical data will not
be lost. All you need to do is invoke the same mount command and
everything is restored:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo umount /mnt/
$ sudo lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /mnt
$ ls
linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2  linux-2.6.38-rc6.tar.bz2-bak
</pre>
</p><p>
In the situation when a system suffers from an accidental reboot,
possibly due to power loss, as of version 1.0.4, lessfs supports
transactions, which eliminates the need for an <tt  >fsck</tt> after a crash.
</p><p>
Shifting focus back to lessfs preparation, note
that the lessfs volume's options can be defined by the user when
mounting. For instance, you can define the desired options for big_write,
max_read and max_write. The big_write improves throughput when used
for backup purposes, and both max_read and max_write must be defined to
use it. The max_read and max_write options always must be equal to one
another and define the block size for lessfs to use: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
and 128KB. 
</p><p>
The definition of a block size can be used to tune the
filesystem. For example, a larger block size, such as 128KB (131072),
offers faster performance but, unfortunately, at the cost of
less deduplication (remember from earlier that lessfs uses block-level
deduplication). All other options are FUSE-generic options defined in
the FUSE documentation. An example of the use of supported mount options
can be found in the lessfs man page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ man 1 lessfs
</pre>
</p><p>
The following example is  given to mount lessfs with a 128KB
block size:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /fuse -o negative_timeout=0,\
        entry_timeout=0,attr_timeout=0,use_ino,\
        readdir_ino, default_permissions,allow_other,big_writes,\
        max_read=131072,max_write=131072
</pre>
</p><p>
Additional configurable options for the database exist in your
lessfs.cfg file (the same file you copied over to the /etc directory
path earlier). The block size can be defined here as well as even the method
of additional data compression to use on the deduplicated data and
more. Below is an excerpt of what the configuration file contains. In
order to define a new value for various options clearly, just uncomment
the option desired and, in turn, comment everything else:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BLKSIZE=131072
#BLKSIZE=65536
#BLKSIZE=32768
#BLKSIZE=16384
#BLKSIZE=4096
#COMPRESSION=none
COMPRESSION=qlz
#COMPRESSION=lzo
#COMPRESSION=bzip
#COMPRESSION=deflate
#COMPRESSION=disabled
</pre>
</p><p>
This excerpt defines the default block size to 128KB and the default
compression method to QuickLZ. If the defaults are not to your liking,
in this file you also can define the commit to disk intervals (default is
30 seconds) or a new path for your databases, but make sure to initialize
the databases before use; otherwise, you'll get an error when you try
to mount the lessfs filesystem.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Now, Linux is not limited to a single data deduplication solution. There
also is SDFS, a file-level deduplication filesystem that also runs
on the FUSE module. SDFS is a freely available cross-platform solution
(Linux and Windows) made available by the Opendedup Project. On
its official Web site, the project highlights the filesystem's
scalability (it can dedup a petabyte or more of data); speed, performing
deduplication/reduplication at a line speed of 290MB/s and higher; support
for VMware while also mentioning its usage in Xen and KVM; flexibility
in storage, as deduplicated data can be stored locally, on the network
across multiple nodes (NFS/CIFS and iSCSI), or in the cloud; inline
and batch mode deduplication (a method of post-process deduplication);
and file and folder snapshot support. The project seems to be pushing
itself as an enterprise-class solution, and with features like these,
Opendedup means business.
</p><p>
It is also not surprising that since 2008, data deduplication has
been a requested feature for Btrfs, the next-generation Linux filesystem.
Although that also may be in response to Sun Microsystem's
(now Oracle's) development of data deduplication into its advanced ZFS
filesystem. Unfortunately, at this point in time, it is unknown if
and when Btrfs will introduce data deduplication support, although it
already contains support for various types of
data compression (such as zlib and LZO).
</p><p>
Currently, the lessfs2 release is under development, and it is supposed
to introduce snapshot support, fast inode cloning, new databases
(including hamsterdb and possibly BerkeleyDB) apart from tokyocabinet,
self-healing RAID (to repair corrupted chunks) and more.
</p><p>
As you can see, with a little time and effort, it is relatively simple
to utilize the recent trend of data deduplication to reduce the total
capacity consumed on a storage volume by removing all redundant copies
of data. I recommend its usage in not only server administration
but even for personal use, primarily because with implementations such
as lessfs, even if there isn't too much redundant data, the additional
data compression will help reduce the total size of the file when it is
eventually written to disk. It is also worth mentioning that the
lessfs-enabled volume does not need to remain local to the host system, but
it 
also can be exported across a network via NFS to even iSCSI and utilized
by other devices within that same network, providing a more flexible
solution.
