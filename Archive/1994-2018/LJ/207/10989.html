Create multiple private
workspaces for clients, friends, family and coworkers, and

Google is a great company that delivers world-class solutions, yet
like governments, if you rely on them or any other entity to keep
your best interests at heart, you may be in need of some Freedom
Technology. I am a regular user of Google's Gmail, and I was using
its Calendar and Sites daily in my work. We stored all relevant assets
for Web projects, like database login information, Web site content
and images, logos and banners in Google Sites. Being able to access
all this information from anywhere at anytime, while keeping it
private, proved to be a valuable tool. One fine morning in February
2009, I tried to log in to Google Sites to begin a new project and
was met with &ldquo;Your Account Has Been Disabled&rdquo;.
</p><p>
After being directed to a short form and submitting several requests
for help, it took three weeks for Google to re-instate access to the
account. I learned that the affiliate links we stored in Google Sites
in our &ldquo;Code Snippets&rdquo; repository were considered to be in violation
of Google's Terms of Service. Our sites were used as a private intranet,
and the information stored there was used only to build Web sites,
not display them, so it wasn't a violation at all. Yet, I had to
re-create the information for roughly 25 different clients and
projects, and I felt robbed of my data&mdash;or at least strong-armed away
from it. 
</p><p>
As soon as access was restored, I downloaded all of the
remaining data, deleted it and vowed never to use Google or any other
SaaS account for mission-critical data again. From now on, it's my
data, and I'm taking back control. This set me on a search for a
Google Apps/Sites replacement that I could run on my own server. I
made a list of requirements for the ideal solution:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Store information (mainly documents, graphics and notes).
</p></li><li><p>
Allow me to share it with users, designers, developers and clients
selectively.
</p></li><li><p>
Act as a repository of tasks, deadlines and milestones.
</p></li><li><p>
Easily keep everyone involved in the project(s) in the loop.
</p></li><li><p>
Share tasks and calendar events.
</p></li><li><p>
Be easy to back up.
</p></li><li><p>
Be open source/GPL'd.
</p></li><li><p>
Run on <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I discovered OpenGoo (now called FengOffice) on SourceForge less than
a month later. Fast-forward two years, and my system never
has experienced a hiccup, let alone data loss, and at least 25 different
people I work with use it every day. My data is backed up securely,
automatically every night, and it's accessible 24/7 from any Web browser or
mobile device. OpenGoo uses the ExtJs framework and is designed to
run completely in the Web browser, so it's platform-independent. The
data is stored in open, non-proprietary formats, so I can access it
from any device out there and transfer it easily between applications.
 It's pure Geek Zen. It's Freedom Technology.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fbc48"></a>
Zen and the Art of Installation</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to walk you through setting up and running your own &ldquo;office
in the clouds&rdquo; that will give you both peace of mind and total
control. Once installed on your server, you will have 24/7 access to your
Web-based documents (including graphics), spreadsheets (coming soon),
presentations, task lists (with time tracker), e-mail, calendars, Web
links, contacts and reports.
</p><p>
The prerequisites for running OpenGoo are the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Linux server.
</p></li><li><p>
Apache &gt;= 2.0.
</p></li><li><p>
MySQL &gt;= 5.0 (5.2 recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
MySQL &gt;= 4.1 with InnoDB support.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note: the default memory limit for PHP is 8MB. A new OpenGoo
install consumes 10MB, so you may get a message similar to &ldquo;Allowed
memory size of
8388608 bytes exhausted&rdquo;. Solve this by setting
<tt  >memory_limit=32</tt> in php.ini.
</p><p>
Let's launch the on-line office at http://getwebup.com/office. Here are
the steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Download the latest version of OpenGoo at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengoo/files/fengoffice" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/opengoo/files/fengoffice</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Unpack the files and upload (via FTP) everything under
feng_community to your desired location (for this example, I created and
used /home/getwebup/public_html/office).
</p></li><li><p>
Log in to your server CPANEL, create the database and user/password
(I used getwebup_office for both). You are going to have a great
place to store this information soon, so go ahead and use the password
generator to create a difficult password.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the user getwebup_office to the database: getwebup_office,
and be sure to assign all privileges.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f1.large.jpg"><img src="10989f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Adding the User to the Database in CPANEL
</p></div></div><p>
Now you can exit CPANEL, as the rest of the installation is done from
within OpenGoo's installer.
In your browser, go to <a href="http://getwebup.com/office/feng/public/install" target="_self">getwebup.com/office/feng/public/install</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f2.large.jpg"><img src="10989f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Installation Made Easy
</p></div></div><p>
The OpenGoo installation will prompt you for your database and server
information, after which you create your Administrative login. Once
completed, you are ready to go, and you can access your new on-line
office at http://.getwebup.com/office.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fca60"></a>
Setting Up the Ultimate On-line Office</h2></div></div><p>
Let's get to work setting up OpenGoo as your private digital
workspace. I use it every day, and it's been an incredible asset. My
clients tell me it's very intuitive, and they enjoy being able to keep
abreast of the development process. They can schedule appointments,
comment on projects, add tasks or notes and contribute documents and
images easily. The developers and I don't have to search our e-mail
for attachments that inevitably get lost like that &ldquo;other&rdquo; sock in the
wash.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f3.large.jpg"><img src="10989f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Here's a screenshot from our new office installation.
</p></div></div><p>
In the left-side window pane, you have Workspaces, and dominating the
center and right of the screen is the All Workspaces Activity window
and a tabbed interface with these sections: Overview, Notes, Email,
Contacts, Calendar, Documents, Tasks, Web Links, Time and Reporting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df5020"></a>
Creating Workspaces</h2></div></div><p>
Workspaces are where all the action happens. Let's assume you are
using this office for a company called GetWebUp, which provides
business Web services (using only open source and open standards as
the delivery vehicle). You'll note that a &ldquo;userPersonal&rdquo; workspace 
already is created. You can use this for personal login information for
Web sites or even to store to-do lists, recipes and journals. This
workspace will not be visible to anyone but you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f4.large.jpg"><img src="10989f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Adding Workspaces in OpenGoo
</p></div></div><p>
Create a new workspace by clicking on the green plus sign just below the
Workspaces header. This opens the New Workspace page. Let's give
this one the name &ldquo;GetWebUp.com&rdquo;. Click the Description link, and type
some basic information for the project:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GetWebUp.com
A Business Web Services Company
Services Available:
http://getwebup.com/wp-login.php   CMS login
http://getwebup.com/office         On-line Office login
http://getwebup.com/cpanel         Server Control Panel
</pre>
</p><p>
Select Yes in the Show Description option, assign a Parent
Workspace (None), and give the workspace a solid-color green (for
Active). Click Add New Workspace, and it's created and ready to use
for organizing your GetWebUp office data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df54f0"></a>
Creating Sub-Workspaces</h2></div></div><p>
Select the newly created workspace, click Add Workspace to
create sub-workspaces under it, and add two client Workspaces.
Name one Client A.com, and use a solid-color green (for Active).
Name the other Client B.com, and use solid-color red (for InActive).
The GetWebUp Parent Workspace is selected by default, and these two
Workspaces now will appear as Sub-Workspaces, indicated by the plus
sign to the left of the Workspace name. Now you've got a basic
structure in place, so let's create some data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df55f8"></a>
Putting Everything in Its Place</h2></div></div><p>
When we bring in a new client, I create and store several logins, like
control panels, WordPress logins and database servers. I use the
Notes tab for this. Click on the ClientA.com Workspace, and then
click Notes + New. Here you have the ability to assign multiple
workspaces, tags and link objects to the Note. For now, let's just
type in a title and some dummy data to serve as a placeholder.
Add one note each for: &ldquo;Cpanel Server&rdquo;, &ldquo;Database
Server&rdquo;,
&ldquo;eMail
Accounts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wordpress Server&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f5.large.jpg"><img src="10989f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Using Notes to Organize Logins
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you have a place to store ClientA's login information, let's
visit the Documents tab and create placeholders for the Web site
content. Click Documents + New, select Document from the drop-down
menu and create the following by saving blank documents: &ldquo;Home Page
Information&rdquo;, &ldquo;Article 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Article 2&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Article 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;Testimonials&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Contact Us Info&rdquo;.
</p><p>
You also can upload images that will be used for the project. In the
Documents tab, click + New, and select Upload:
&ldquo;ClientA.com-logo.png&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ClientA.com-Banner300x300.png&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now you have a place to store and organize the information you get from
the client before development takes place, so the content is ready when
the Web site is. It also provides great version tracking with document
check-outs, as well as a commenting system on each piece of content
in the system. When the client has a Web site strategy, branding
guidelines and marketing campaigns, those also can be uploaded or created
here. For the time being, the data is assigned (and visible) only to
the user hani (Admin).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f6.large.jpg"><img src="10989f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Sharing and Collaboration, Open-Source Style</h2></div></div><p>
You've got your Workspace set up and data in the system, so let's create
some users to collaborate with.
Go to the Administration panel via the link at the top right of the
screen next to &ldquo;Welcome back hani&rdquo;.
Click on + Add Company under the Client companies icon.
Create Client Company.
Add ClientA.com, and fill in the details as desired.
Add ClientB.com, and fill in the details as desired.
</p><p>
Now click on + Add User under the Users icon.
Create users Dave, Dirk and LJReader, and assign them to ClientA.com.
Click on the Permissions link, and drill down to select the ClientA.com
Workspace. All permissions for the objects in that Workspace are
pre-selected. Now assign a display name, and either let the system
generate a password or specify a password for the user, and check Send
email notification to have it sent. Click Add User, and
OpenGoo adds the user to the office under the ClientA.com Workspace.
</p><p>
Repeat the steps for the rest of ClientA.com's users, and do the same
for these users of ClientB.com: Jill, Kyle and Shawn.
</p><p>
The users are ready to use the office, so let's get back to the
GetWebUp.com Workspace.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f7.large.jpg"><img src="10989f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Workspace Activity Feed
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df6410"></a>
The Workspace Overview Page</h2></div></div><p>
When you return to the GetWebUp.com Workspace, you will have a default
view of the Overview tab. This gives you the 42,000-foot view of
the action in any given Workspace. User activity, new comments,
notes, documents and tasks appear here. We have generated a lot of
activity ourselves, and a news feed of what we have been doing appears
here, as well as handy hyperlinks to the users/data we worked on.
</p><p>
Click on the Notes tab, and select all the notes you created
previously (one by one) and click Edit. Here, you can assign custom properties,
tags and turn commenting on or off. For now, let's just add
Subscribers. This is the equivalent of sharing the data with only the
specified users, so click on that link. Select hani from GetWebUp and
Dave, Dirk and LJReader from the ClientA.com company. These users
now will have access to and be notified of comments and changes to
these notes. Click Apply. Use this same method to share all the
documents you created earlier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df6570"></a>
Managing Time in Your Digital Office</h2></div></div><p>
The calendar in OpenGoo is very well
implemented. It will import from
other systems and allow you to create events quickly, or you can click Edit
Event Details to delve into alarms, recurrence and subscribers with
ease. Your views for Month, Weekly, Daily and Agenda are present with
a large +Add Event button above them. Click on the day directly in
the Month view and the hour specifically in the Day view to set up
appointments and meetings in that slot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f8.large.jpg"><img src="10989f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Monthly Calendar View with Workspace Pane Collapsed
</p></div></div><p>
In the Tasks tab, you can set Milestones for your projects and assign
Tasks to the users involved in the project. These are treated like
regular documents and allow users to comment, collaborate and share
data directly within the Task's screen. This screen also includes two
very useful buttons: Start Work, which is a work-timer feature, and Add
Work, which allows you to add tasks within tasks. Both will give you data
to crunch in the Reporting tab when you perform project time/cost
analysis.
</p><p>
Weblinks allows you to store URLs that link to project-related sites.
 We use this section to store quick links to login pages, development
servers and control panels. Each link can have its own
Subscriber/Workspace settings, which makes it useful for a project
manager to create a central repository of private and public URLS that
both developers and clients can access in one place.
</p><p>
Once the system is in use on a regular basis, the Reporting tab will
give you an inexhaustible number of ways of looking at your data.
From simple time-card generation to detailed workspace usage and
milestone reports, this section lets you create virtually any type of
report required from the office.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df6990"></a>
Rolling Up Your Sleeves</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have your on-line office running and users on the system, you
can perform regular admin tasks by visiting the Administration panel.
 An upgrade tool and cron jobs are available here, as are data and
user tools. OpenGoo even provides the ability to create templates,
user groups and perform billing functions. Let's look at the settings
you can modify.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10989f9.large.jpg"><img src="10989f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. OpenGoo Administration Panel
</p></div></div><p>
In the Configuration section, you can access the General section,
which allows you to specify the File storage system&mdash;either database
or filesystem. I opt for the filesystem, then use rsync to send the
entire office off-site for backups, restoration and portability. The
database option allows you to manage your data MySQL-style from
the command line. Another useful option to set here is to &ldquo;use the
client's logo as the application logo when they log in&rdquo;. This is a
nice touch, as it gives each company a sense of ownership over its
office/workspace.
</p><p>
The Modules screen under Configuration allows you to enable or disable
each section (represented by tabs) in the office. We use Gmail in
lieu of the Contacts and Email sections, so I disable those modules
here to save screen real estate and provide a cleaner interface. You
can use the Custom Properties section to add additional fields of data
to any object type. For example, you can add an expiration date
property to the Note object type. Object subtypes allows you to add
subtypes to task objects like &ldquo;Goal 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Goal 2&rdquo;
and so on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df6e08"></a>
Profile and Workspace Personalization</h2></div></div><p>
The Account link is to the right of Administration, and here you can
update your profile to include an avatar, specify an e-mail address,
time zone and title. In the Edit Preferences screen, you can access
the General, Dashboard, Task, Calendar and Email Options. Use the
options under General to set a default workspace, localization and workday start time. You can add or remove Workspace widgets and set the
Activity Widget size (number of items in the Activity stream) in the
Dashboard options screen. The Calendar options page gives you the
ability to start the week on Monday and show week numbers.
</p><p>
One final step I like to perform, although this is a Chrome browser
feature rather than an OpenGoo setting, is to click on the wrench icon
in Google Chrome, then Tools&rarr;Create Application Shortcuts to
create Icons on my desktop and menus to access my office quickly.
Chrome gives the application a non-decorated window, which gives it the
look and feel of a desktop application. In Ubuntu, I always have this
window running in its own workspace for fast access.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x1df6f68"></a>
Office in the Clouds</h2></div></div><p>
Now you've got your office up 24/7 and out of reach of the general
public,
while remaining completely platform-independent and fully featured on
any device. There is talk of iPhone and Android Apps for OpenGoo on
the horizon, but for now, it's best on Galaxy Tab and iPad-sized screens
unless you like pinch zooming. The application itself is open source
and now hosted on your own server. The data is stored in an open and
non-proprietary format, so you've taken ownership of your own office
in the clouds and increased the versatility of your raw data in the
process. You can export your data from OpenGoo and import it into any
standard application. Although once you get used to having access to
your data at any time and being in total control of it, why go back to
running your business on someone else's proprietary platform?
