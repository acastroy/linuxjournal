Minitube&mdash;Independent YouTube Viewing
(<a href="http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube" target="_self">flavio.tordini.org/minitube</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most annoying burdens facing Linux users is Adobe's
proprietary Flash and its lack of general hardware acceleration. Watch
a YouTube video with one of your Windows-using mates around, and you can
be guaranteed of visual tearing and some pretty low-par performance&mdash;not
cool.
However, you need not fear. Minitube has come to the rescue! 
To quote the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Minitube is a YouTube desktop application. With it, you can watch YouTube
videos in a new way: you type a keyword, and Minitube gives you an endless
video stream. Minitube is not about cloning the original YouTube Web
interface; it aims to create a new TV-like experience.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Light on your computer:</b></span>
by consuming less CPU, Minitube preserves battery life and keeps your
laptop cool. That's because Minitube does not use the Flash player.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>High definition:</b></span>
Minitube plays HD videos up to 1080p. Go full-screen and watch them
play fluidly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>One-click downloads:</b></span>
download your favorite clips to your computer and put them on your
portable device. Downloaded files are in MPEG4 format, which is compatible
with most devices, including Apple ones. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11058f1.large.jpg"><img src="11058f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
YouTube in Glorious HD-Accelerated Full-Screen
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11058f2.large.jpg"><img src="11058f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Minitube also provides its own playlist editor, allowing you to queue whichever videos you like, in any order.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11058f3.large.jpg"><img src="11058f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Minitube's Built-in Downloader&mdash;Practical
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
32-bit x86 users have it easy, as a binary tarball is provided on the
Web site's main page. Binary packages are available in various forms,
some in repositories but outdated, others in personal archives. See the
setup instructions page if you want to try your luck. For the rest of us
(including me, a 64-bit user), there's the source.
</p><p>
Grab the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new
window. Before you can start compiling, you need to install a number of preliminary
libraries. Luckily, the Web site provided the
following command for users of Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives for
installing dependencies:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4 libqt4-xml libqt4-network 
&#8618;libqt4-dbus phonon-backend-gstreamer gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg 
&#8618;gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
</pre>
</p><p>
I can't give information for packages under other distributions, but
hopefully the package names above should give you a clue as to what you need.
</p><p>
Once you have installed the dependencies, installing Minitube is actually
pretty easy. Just enter the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qmake
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
The documentation warns that this step is for packagers and not end
users. I'm not sure what the concern is, but if you're as equally
unworried as myself, enter these commands.
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that's finished, you can run the program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ minitube
</pre>
</p><p>
However, if you share the developer's aversion to this installation
method, you can run the program with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./build/target/minitube
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Actually using Minitube is a pretty easy and
intuitive affair. In the
middle of the screen as well as on the top right are search bars where you
enter keywords, the same as you would on YouTube. Enter your search, and
a list of results will appear in the next screen, sorted by groups of ten.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, when I tried it, the first result automatically
started playing. I'm not sure I like that, but I imagine the interface
for playing and the playlist will be refined over time. This is software
in development, after all.
</p><p>
Scroll down the pane on the left, left-click on any video to play it,
and the video plays on the right. It's all pretty standard so far, but
double-click and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>, full-screen playback
with hardware acceleration&mdash;the way YouTube was always meant to be!
</p><p>
Exploring the program further, you can edit the playlist on the left 
by clicking and dragging videos up and down. You also can refine searches 
by using the three tabs: Most relevant, Most recent and Most
viewed. Thankfully, the controls everyone takes for granted also
are included, such as a sliding volume control, stop, pause, skip and the
all-important seeking bar.
</p><p>
However, this program's biggest hook is its Download
option. Obviously, this allows you to download the video you're watching at
the time, but what isn't so obvious is that Minitube also has a download
manager, where you not only can download videos, but also download multiple
streams simultaneously. It's clever too; try to quit while it's in
the middle of a download, and Minitube warns you and prompts you
with a dialog asking whether to quit or to wait until the downloading
has finished.
</p><p>
If you still need to do things the normal way, the Video menu has options
for opening the actual YouTube page (presumably so you can read all of
the obligatory snide comments below the video). Other clever features
include copying the YouTube URL, as well as the actual streaming video
URL, for the advanced users out there. And for the rest of us, at the
bottom right is a setting for maximum video definition, 360, 720 and
1080p&mdash;very handy.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, Minitube provides a sleek solution to one of the
most annoying problems Linux users face: bad YouTube playback. It's not
Linux's fault, but proprietary solutions such as Flash always
will burden us with these annoyances. Of course, it's not just YouTube that uses
Flash and suffers from these performance woes, but at least it's a start
(I'm sure Minitube could be modified to work with other popular sites,
such Hulu and so on).
</p><p>
Although Minitube has some interface oddities, it still is a slick program
nonetheless. And, when watching these videos in a simple and comfortable
interface, released from the clunky shackles of a Web browser, I can't
help but feel that this is what YouTube was meant to be like in the
first place.

Minbar and the Islamic Tools and Libraries
<a href="http://projects.arabeyes.org/project.php?proj=ITL" target="_self">projects.arabeyes.org/project.php?proj=ITL</a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been meaning to explore applications available
for our Muslim readers for some time now. My main focus here is on the
Minbar Project, but I also explore some of the highlights of
the Islamic Tools and Libraries (ITL).
</p><p>
As a side note, I'm not a Muslim myself, so for our Islamic readers,
I beg your patience for any silly mistakes I might make (I hope my
research will be accurate, nevertheless).
</p><p>
To quote the man page:
&ldquo;Minbar is a GNOME Islamic prayer times application. At first start, you
have to configure it with your location, time zone and madhhab
details.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11058f4.large.jpg"><img src="11058f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Minbar provides Islamic prayer times and direction in a convenient app
that lives conveniently in your taskbar.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11058f5.large.jpg"><img src="11058f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Minbar makes it as easy as possible to enter your world location,
finding the Qibla direction automatically.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Minbar's Web site was down when I wrote this, so no source
tarball was available. However, Minbar seems to be a common package in
distro repositories, so you should be able to install it that way.
</p><p>
Once installed, Minbar should be in your system menu (Utilities&rarr;Minbar
Prayer Times on my Kubuntu machine), or you can run it with the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ minbar
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
You'll be greeted by a fairly simple window, with Qibla direction
in the center and prayer times on the left. However, you need
to do some setting up before you really can use Minbar.
</p><p>
As the man page states, you first have to configure your location,
time zone and Madhhab details. Click on Preferences, and 
you'll be presented with your city details. Here you define your
latitude, longitude, city name and time zone. If you live in a major
city, click on Find City, and there's a good chance your city will
be on the list, so you won't need to enter these details manually.
</p><p>
I'm not entirely sure to which part of the GUI the Madhhab preference
is referring&mdash;whether it's in the Calculation Method or perhaps
more likely, your choice of Athan.
</p><p>
For choosing the Calculation Method, this is under the Advanced tab. I
chose &ldquo;University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi (Shaf'i)&rdquo;, just because
one of my favorite foods is made in Karachi. Athan has its own tab.
</p><p>
With my installation, there weren't any Athan files included, but you
can browse for your own through your filesystem and test it with the
Play and Stop buttons. Separate file choices are available for the Subh
Athan and the Normal Athan.
</p><p>
Once your configuration is out of the way, click OK, and you'll go
back to the main screen. Here you will find that all of the values
are updated and running in real time, including the newly aligned
Qibla direction and prayer times on the left.
</p><p>
A handy feature below that is a green text field giving you a real-time
countdown until the next prayer time, which at this moment says,
&ldquo;5 hours and 55 minutes until Subh prayer&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you look to the right, there's a check box where you can choose
whether or not to play the Athan. An invaluable timetable also is on
the right, with the button marked Prayer Calendar. This was quite
educational to me as a non-Muslim, as I didn't realize there were
different prayer times at different points on the calendar. For instance,
the month I wrote this, while Dhuhr pretty much stayed put, Shorook was
at 6:52 on the 12th and 7:02 on the 26th.
</p><p>
In the end, Minbar is a clever little application, and once it's configured,
it isn't the least bit daunting to use, with very simple GUI elements. Minbar
also integrates into the desktop nicely like any other widget, living
in the taskbar with small status updates when the mouse pointer hovers
over it and calling up the main window when clicked on.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Minbar is an excellent use of modern technology for making
daily life more convenient while remaining unobtrusive to the rest of the
desktop. This excellent desktop integration, in turn, hopefully should allow
Muslims to integrate Minbar into their daily work PCs and have prayer
time reminders live seamlessly alongside other working applications.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>The Islamic Tools and Libraries</b></span>
</p><p>
Let's briefly 
explore some more components of ITL. To quote the ArabEyes.org Web site:
&ldquo;The Islamic Tools and Libraries (ITL) is a project to provide a plethora
of useful Islamic tools and applications as well as a comprehensive
feature-full Islam-centric library. The ITL project currently includes
Hijri date, Muslim prayer times and Qibla.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Included are two packages (of which I also found in my distro repository):
libitl and itools.
</p><p>
About the libitl package, the documentation says,
&ldquo;This library allows applications to convert between Hijri/Gregorian
dates and compute Muslim prayer times and Qibla direction based on
multiple methods of calculation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The itools documentation says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The itools is a collection of command-line tools that mimics the
development of the underlying ITL library (libitl) and is meant to always
give the end user simple means to access its functions. The available
tools are:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ical: display a Hijri calendar.
</p></li><li><p>
idate: multi-method Hijri/Gregorian date converter.
</p></li><li><p>
ipraytime: prayer times and Qibla calculator and schedule table generator.
</p></li><li><p>
ireminder: prayer time reminder Perl script.
</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>
If you check out the Projects page at ArabEyes, you'll see that volunteers
are working on a large number of
major projects to achieve better Arabic
support, such as Firefox, GNOME, KDE, Drupal and so on.
</p><p>
Hopefully projects like these will make GNU Linux the easy option in
the Islamic and/or Arabic worlds (non-Muslim Arabs at least can benefit
from the better localization ITL will provide).
