With Open-USB-IO, your Linux system can drive motors and LEDs, read
switches, talk to RS-232 and more. You can add your own code to the ATMEGA32
microprocessor on the board and debug it with a symbolic debugger.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107c250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux is wonderful for many things, such as manipulating data and working
with the Web. But, pull your gaze away from your computer's screen for
an instant, and you'll notice that Linux (and any other operating
system) can't do much in the real world. What might you want to do in
the real world using Linux? How about controlling motors, solenoids and
lights? Add to this the ability to sense switches, light levels and any
analog voltage. What could you do with all this? That really depends
on your imagination. How about an automated beer-brewing controller or
automatic blinds? How about controlling a robot arm to throw a paper dart or
creating a grey-water controller? After you have proved it works under
Linux control, if need be, you can move the program into a micro-controller
board so your Linux box is free to do other things.
</p><p>
If this appeals to you, the FOSS Open-USB-IO board shown in Figure 1
may be
exactly what you need. There also is a live DVD that has a detailed manual,
example projects and the source code for all the software. The live DVD
is the easiest way to get results quickly. It also has a huge range of
Linux development tools and helpful documentation. The manual can be
downloaded free from my Web site listed at the end of this article.

Historically, hobbyists used the parallel printer port or a serial
port to drive hardware. You still can find a lot of projects on the Web
that use this approach. These legacy ports started disappearing from
laptops long ago and are beginning to disappear from desktops. Hardware control via USB 
rapidly is becoming the only viable approach.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107c670"></a>
Open-USB-IO Features</h2></div></div><p>
Key hardware on the board includes digital and analog inputs and
outputs, eight switches, eight LEDs, a light-dependent resistor, seven motor control
lines that can take up to 50v and 500ma each, an RS-232 port and three
Pulse Width Modulators, which are great for motor-speed control. All the
connections come to plugs, which can be connected to external hardware
with an old IDE cable (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10793f2.large.jpg"><img src="10793f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
There are three key bits of software. This first is a command-line
program that drives the USB interface on the PC. It doesn't need any
special drivers and runs like any other command-line program. The second
is the USB client program that comes programmed into the Open-USB-IO
board. This interfaces with the USB and provides a whole range of useful
commands to control the hardware. The third software program is also on
the board: a USB bootloader that allows you to download your own
code into the ATMEGA32 microprocessor using just the USB cable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107c988"></a>
Control Where?</h2></div></div><p>
The Open-USB-IO hardware can be controlled from several different
levels. You can use:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GUI (coming soon or make your own).
</p></li><li><p>
Command line.
</p></li><li><p>
Bash script on the PC.
</p></li><li><p>
C/C++ or almost any other language on the PC.
</p></li><li><p>
C or assembler code that runs on the microprocessor on the board.
User code can run at the same time as the USB interface, which
includes a powerful symbolic debugger.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One neat approach is to write in C code on the PC and play around
until you get what you want. Next, move this C code to a shell ATMEGA32
project, and
make the code run on the board, which then does not need a PC connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107ceb0"></a>
Playing with the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
Open-USB-IO comes with a command-line program called ousb that can be
downloaded from my Web site (see Resources). Put this
in the path, typically /usr/local/bin, and ensure that it's executable.
Next,
plug in a USB cable to the board and you're ready to go.
</p><p>
To see all the commands, just type <tt  >ousb</tt>. To turn on
all eight lights, open
a terminal window and type the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb io portb 255
</pre>
</p><p>
To turn on alternate lights and then turn them off, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb io portb 85
$ ousb io portb 0
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want the state of the switches, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb -b io pinc
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-b</tt> will make the response in binary so you can
see each bit clearly.
</p><p>
Let's control a motor. A Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) puts out a square
wave where the on period is adjustable from 0% to 100%. Type the
following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb pwm-freq 1 700
$ ousb pwm 1 50
</pre>
</p><p>
This turns on PWM 1 at a frequency of about 700Hz and a duty cycle
(on period) of 50%. You should see LED3 glow at half intensity. If you
have a small DC motor that can run off five volts, connect it as shown in
Figure 3. Connect the motor to pins 39 and 27 of plug J5 (blue wires),
and connect pin 39 to 37 (red wire). The motor should start turning
slowly. To make it run at full speed, 100% duty cycle, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb pwm 1 100
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10793f3.large.jpg"><img src="10793f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. DC Motor Connections
</p></div></div><p>
What's the light level on the board? Try typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb adc 6
</pre>
</p><p>
Try holding your finger over the LDR just above the LEDs, and try again.
</p><p>
The Open-USB-IO manual has a complete list of all the commands you can
use and lots of examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107d748"></a>
Script Programming on the PC</h2></div></div><p>
Bash script programs are great for small jobs and are quick and relatively easy to
develop. For our purposes, they really are just ousb command lines plus any control flow
required. Below is one example from the live DVD that turns the LEDs
into a light chaser and prints out the value of the switches:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
PATTERN=1
until  [ 0 != 0 ]
do
    ousb io PORTB $PATTERN          # write to the LEDs
    READ=$(ousb io PORTC)           # read the switches.
    echo " LED Output= $PATTERN, Input on PORTC= $READ."
    sleep 0.3
    let "PATTERN = PATTERN + PATTERN"
    if [ $PATTERN == 256 ]          # Check for roll over
        then PATTERN=1
    fi
done
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107d8a8"></a>
C, C++ and Other Languages on the PC</h2></div></div><p>
Script programs are great, but they have a few problems. The syntax is
a little arcane at times&mdash;for example, white space matters in some
places. There is no real error detection.
If a line has an error, it may not be detected until the line executes.
If you use the <tt  >set -u</tt> command, you sometimes can catch a misspelled variable.
</p><p>
For these and other reasons, larger applications are written in high-level
languages, such as C, C++ and Python. Open-USB-IO is easy to control
from these high-level languages, providing that the language has some
way to invoke a command line and read the response. When programming
Open-USB-IO applications on the PC, I usually program in C, because it's
then a small step to moving the code into the microprocessor on the board.
</p><p>
Here is a simple C code fragment that runs on the PC and will read and
write from the board:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//--- function to read and write Open-USB-IO.
int do_ousb_command(char* command)
{
  char   line[100];
  FILE*  fpipe;
  if ( !(fpipe = popen(command,"r")) ) {
      printf("pipe error\n");
      exit(1);
  }
  fgets(line, sizeof line, fpipe);
  pclose(fpipe);
  return(atoi(line)) ;
}

...

//--- how to use the function, a write then a read-
do_ousb_command("ousb -r io portb 0x55") ;
printf("Value of PORTB is now %i\n",
       do_ousb_command("ousb -r io portb")
</pre>
</p><p>
As you will see later, to move this code to the ATMEGA32 microprocessor on
the Open-USB-IO board, you throw away the function do_ousb_command. Each
use of <tt  >do_ousb_command()</tt> must be changed into a native IO port
reference. In this case:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PORTB = 0x55;
portb_read_value = PORTB;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x107dc18"></a>
Faster and Faster</h2></div></div><p>
The examples above all invoke the ousb program once for each command. On
most Linux boxes, this limits the speed to about 25 commands per
second. This is fast enough for most applications, but sometimes more
speed is required. For example, the motor drive lines can be used
to drive a stepper motor, such as those found in old floppy drives. A
speed of 25 commands a second means it takes some eight seconds to do a full
rotation. This is where the ousb <tt  >-file</tt> and
<tt  >-multi</tt> command options become
useful and allow 200&ndash;250 commands per second. The
<tt  >-file</tt> option makes
ousb take its commands from a file. The <tt  >-multi</tt> option allows ousb to stay
in memory and take its commands from a pipe connected to an application
program. The live DVD has examples of how to use these options. Your
stepper motor now takes only a second for a full rotation! To go even
faster,
you can write C code for the ATMEGA32 microprocessor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf84580.0x1074710"></a>
Cutting Free</h2></div></div><p>
So now you have got the hardware working well from your C code on a Linux
box. It's easy to move the same code into the microprocessor on the board
and have the board operate in standalone mode. The manual and the example
projects on the live DVD show you exactly how to do this. Basically,
compile your code with the avr-gcc compiler then download it with the
USB bootloader already programmed onto the board.
This is called Co-USB, where your code cohabitates with the USB code on the ATMEGA32.
</p><p>
Now, unplug the USB cable, plug in a regulated 5-volt wall wart, and the
board will happily work by itself!
</p><p>
Perhaps even better, the Co-USB concept allows you to add your code to
the existing USB interface code and built-in debugger. The USB code
is hidden away as interrupt-driven code and has little effect on the
user code. With the USB link active, your application running on the
Open-USB-IO board can talk to another program you write on the PC. This
can be really useful&mdash;for example, for a data logger. The Open-USB-IO board can
collect data in a standalone manner. You can come along with your laptop,
plug in the USB cable, and then suck up all the data and post-process it.
</p><p>
Let's look at a simple example to show how Co-USB works. This is taken
from the Co-USB folder available on the live DVD. A make file handles
all the details of compiling and downloading code; type <tt  >make
help</tt>
to see all the make options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//====== user constants and variables.
volatile uint8_t  counter;
volatile float    fb[] = { 56789.1, 0.34};

//====== SYSTEM hooks.
void user_system_500us_interrupt()
{}
void user_command(uint8_t*  get_ctrl,
                  uint16_t* get_addr,
                  uint16_t* val)
{}

//====== Executive Loop.
void user_forever_loop()
{
    for ( ; ; ) {
        _delay_ms(200);   // delay 200ms
         PORTB ^= 0x01;   // toggle the PB0 LED.
        ++counter;        // increment once per loop.
        BREAKPOINT(3);    // breakpoint
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
To compile the program, open a terminal and type <tt  >make
all</tt>. Download
using the USB bootloader with <tt  >make usbprog</tt>. The LED
PB0 now should 
start flashing. The following commands come from a debugging session
with a real Open-USB-IO board (text after the # are added comments):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ousb symr counter     # read the variable counter.
counter (type 'uc' at 0xc2) length 1 is:  55
$ ousb symw counter 0   # write zero to counter.
$ ousb symr -f fb 2     # read the array.
fb (type 'f' at 0x68) length 2 is:  56789.1  0.34
$ ousb bp 3             # Set breakpoint 3, code stops
$ ousb bp cont          # Continue,  stops on next loop
$ ousb bp -3            # Disable the breakpoint
$ ousb cont             # Continue, no breakpoints now
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the user_command() function in the code above. From the PC, the
command <tt  >ousb user</tt> sends up to three integers to this function. You can
put your own code in the function to do whatever you want.
You also can use the function
<tt  >user_system_500us_interrupt()</tt> to execute
your own code. As its name implies, it is called every 500 microseconds.
If you don't need it, just leave it empty.
</p><p>
There are many useful options for displaying and writing different data
types, such as strings and characters. All the read and write commands
also can be applied to the EEPROM memory in the ATMEGA32, which keeps
its value when power is removed.

Up, Up and Away</h2></div></div><p>
It takes very little knowledge of electronics to get a lot done with
Open-USB-IO. Anyone who has done a college or secondary-school option
in electronics, or who is a hobbyist, can connect up switches, motors and
LEDs to do all manner of things. There are lots of electronics cookbooks
and good resources on the Web to help you with ideas and circuits.
</p><p>
I have seen some very exciting projects done by people with little
more than basic electronics skills. For example, how about controlling
banks of floodlights using Open-USB-IO and optical relays? How about a
complete pump controller that handles a dam, tank or grey-water, and has
an RF link to a control panel? Or, consider making a white-line tracking
model car. In all these projects, the Co-USB concept is very important:
program the ATMEGA32 microprocessor with user code and link in the USB
interface code with the built-in debugger. Develop and debug the user
code on the ATMEGA32 until it works. Next, pull out the USB cable and
leave the Open-USB-IO board running. If the program goes wrong, plug
in the USB cable and debug what's happening.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Linux by itself is great, but it can be so much more if you can control
hardware. Open-USB-IO has a unique combination of hardware and software
features that offers a lot to casual users or experienced experts. You
can control hardware from the PC command line or your own PC programs. You
can program the ATMEGA32 microprocessor on the board, and even keep the
USB interface code and its powerful symbolic debugger. It takes
only a little knowledge to get real hardware working, and if you have more
experience, you are limited only by your imagination.
