How to combine two MVC frameworks&mdash;one on the client, one on the
server&mdash;for even more powerful applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2320300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I started looking at Backbone.js, an increasingly popular
framework for Web applications written in JavaScript. If you think
that Web development frameworks exist only on the server, you're
in for a surprise. A growing number of frameworks have sprung up on
the browser, written in JavaScript and meant to execute completely
within that environment. You can think of such frameworks as having
less to do with the Web and more to do with the creation of a
full-fledged application inside a browser, using a combination of
HTML, CSS and (of course) JavaScript.
</p><p>
Many client-side frameworks use the established MVC
(model-view-controller) paradigm that has existed for several decades
and has proven to be both useful and powerful in developing both
Web and desktop applications. By keeping the code organized in a
standard way, the design and maintenance of the application are
simplified to a great degree, allowing you to concentrate on your
application's domain, rather than more general architectural
decisions.
</p><p>
In MVC, one set of objects (the models) represents the data, sometimes
known as the &ldquo;business objects&rdquo;, and all of their associated logic.
The &ldquo;view&rdquo; consists of what the user will see on the screen, either
initially or after some manipulations have been performed. Finally,
the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; objects receive requests from the user and route them
to the appropriate models and views. Each implementation of MVC is
slightly different, but the separation of authority into these three
categories helps a great deal.
</p><p>
Last month, I built a very simple appointment calendar, allowing you
to indicate with whom you are meeting, and when (which has been broken into
two files, Listings 1 and 2). Aside from the
numerous usability problems that were associated with that application
(not surprising for a magazine tutorial), there was one clear issue
with this appointment calendar. The moment you close your browser
window, the entire calendar disappears from memory, never to return.

For me, and I assume for many other Web developers, this is a new
situation. For years, my Web applications largely have been a visual
representation of what I had stored in the database. True, users
always could change things without clicking a &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button, but AJAX
reduced that risk. And, even if you lost one page's worth of data, it
usually was the minority of what someone had entered. In the world of
JavaScript applications, by contrast, you don't lose only a little bit,
you lose the entire thing! This is clearly unacceptable.
</p><p>
For this reason, browser-based MVC applications increasingly
are hooking together with server-side MVC applications. The JavaScript
model in such an application saves itself not to disk or to a
database, but via a RESTful URL on a server somewhere. That server
is, in turn, running its own MVC application, and accepts the
data, stores it and makes it available to other applications. I've
started to call these applications &ldquo;MVC-squared&rdquo;, because they involve
two separate MVC applications&mdash;although clearly, neither is all that
useful without the other. Different client-side frameworks tackle
this in different ways, and my hope is to cover a few other JavaScript
frameworks in the coming months, so you can compare the different
techniques they use to accomplish similar goals.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2320cf8"></a>
Setting Up Your Server</h2></div></div><p>
To begin, you need to set up a Web application on your server.
I use Ruby on Rails here, but so long as you're using a server
application that understands and adheres to the REST conventions, you
should be just fine. First, I create a Rails application
called &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; that uses PostgreSQL as its back-end database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rails new appointments -d postgresql
</pre>
</p><p>
I create a PostgreSQL database for the development environment:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ createuser -P appointments

Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

$ createdb -U appointments appointments_appointments_development
</pre>
</p><p>
Given that I gave the &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; user a password (also
&ldquo;appointments&rdquo;), I have go into config/database.yml and add a
value in the &ldquo;password&rdquo; field for the
&ldquo;development&rdquo; environment. I
always like to test that I can connect to the database using the
<tt  >rails db -p</tt> command, which connects me to the
&ldquo;psql&rdquo; client program
using the password in the development environment. If this works,
I know my database connection is working correctly.
</p><p>
Now, let's create a resource in the Rails application&mdash;an
appointment. The most important thing here is to ensure that your data
is aligned between the server and the client, in both name and type.
In this example application, I'm storing each appointment as three
fields: the name of the person with whom I'm meeting (&ldquo;person&rdquo;), the
date and time of the meeting (&ldquo;starts_at&rdquo;) and notes about the
meeting (&ldquo;notes&rdquo;). The Backbone.js application uses these same names,
but assumes that all are text strings; I define the starts_at
column as being of type &ldquo;timestamp&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, let's create the resource, along with a skeleton controller and
views:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g scaffold appointment person:text starts_at:timestamp note:text
</pre>
</p><p>
I should note that this is a highly non-normalized database
definition, which means that it'll be highly inefficient, as well as
inflexible. I'm a big fan of normalization, but right now, that's less
important than seeing how the parts fit together.
</p><p>
The first and most important thing that this generator does is create
a migration (in db/migrations). The migration looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreateAppointments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
create_table :appointments do |t|
  t.text :person
  t.timestamp :starts_at
  t.text :note

  t.timestamps
end
  end

  def self.down
drop_table :appointments
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
I always like to tighten up the definitions a bit, as well as provide
some indexes that'll allow me to search through the database more
efficiently:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreateAppointments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
create_table :appointments do |t|
  t.text :person, :null =&gt; false
  t.timestamp :starts_at, :null =&gt; false
  t.text :note, :null =&gt; true

  t.timestamps
end

add_index :appointments, :person
add_index :appointments, :starts_at
add_index :appointments, :note
  end

  def self.down
drop_table :appointments
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Run the migration with <tt  >rake db:migrate</tt>. Assuming that all went
well, the database now contains an &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; table, which
you can
access via ActiveRecord.
</p><p>
The generator did a bit more than just create the migration, a basic
controller and views; it also added the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
resource :appointments
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2321850"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to the config/routes.rb file. This one line has a great deal more
influence than you might think. It tells Rails that you want to expose
the &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; object as a resource, using the seven standard
controller actions (index, show, new, create, edit, update and
delete) that correspond to HTTP request methods. By ensuring that your
object is exposed using REST, you more easily can hook it up to your
Backbone.js application.
</p><p>
You also will need to adjust your controller (Listing 3). Backbone.js communicates
with the server by default using JSON, which means that in each
scaffold controller action, you either can add a new line for the JSON
format or replace it entirely. For example, after adding JSON to the
&ldquo;index&rdquo; action, it looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def index
  @appointments = Appointment.all

  logger.warn "Found '#{@appointments.size}' appointments"

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # index.html.erb
    format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @appointments }
    format.json  { render :json =&gt; @appointments }
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Removing non-JSON entirely lets you rewrite it as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def index
  Appointment.all.to_json
end
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2321c18"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which is both shorter and more understandable.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x262cb38"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. appointments_controller.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

class AppointmentsController &lt; ApplicationController
 def index
   render :json =&gt; Appointment.all
 end

 def show
   render :json =&gt; Appointment.find(params[:id])
 end

 def new
   @appointment = Appointment.new
 end

 def edit
   @appointment = Appointment.find(params[:id])
 end

 def create
   params.delete('action')
   params.delete('controller')
   @appointment = Appointment.new(params)

   if @appointment.save
     render :json =&gt; 'Appointment was successfully created.'
   else
     render :json =&gt; 'Error creating appointment.'
   end
 end

 def update
   @appointment = Appointment.find(params[:id])

   if @appointment.update_attributes(params[:appointment])
     render :json =&gt; 'Appointment was successfully updated.'
   else
     render :json =&gt; 'Error updating appointment.'
   end
 end

 def destroy
   @appointment = Appointment.find(params[:id])
   @appointment.destroy

   render :json =&gt; "Appointment destroyed."
 end
end

</pre></div><p>
Now, this example Rails application might be small, but it already works.
You
can start the server with <tt  >rails s</tt>
and visit it at port 3000 (the default). Because I didn't remove the
original index page from the &ldquo;public&rdquo; directory, simply going to
localhost:3000 is going to show just the default &ldquo;Welcome to
Rails&rdquo;
page. But, if you go to http://localhost:3000/appointments/,
you see that the scaffolding is available, showing a list of the
current appointments (that is, nothing), as well as a link to create a
new appointment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x262cea8"></a>
MVC, Please Meet MVC</h2></div></div><p>
You now have two distinct applications that share an underlying data
model. On the browser is the Backbone.js application, whose
&ldquo;Appointment&rdquo; model and associated collections allow you to create
appointments, as well as view them. And there's the Rails application,
which also has an &ldquo;Appointment&rdquo; model, as well as ways to view them.
Now, let's connect them, such that the Backbone.js model will
save and receive its data from the Rails application.
</p><p>
You can get this all to work by adding a &ldquo;url&rdquo; method to your model,
such that it knows the URLs it can use to retrieve and store
data. Let's also add a controller, which will make it easier
to organize the code, as well as accomplish various tasks with it.
</p><p>
It turns out that although Backbone.js is an MVC framework, it grew
iteratively and over time. Controllers weren't originally part of the
framework, which means that as you saw in last month's code example, you
even can get away without a controller at all, using only views and
models. That alone is quite different from Rails MVC, which wouldn't
do much without a controller.
</p><p>
Another difference between Backbone.js controllers and their Rails
counterparts is that in Backbone.js, routes&mdash;the mappings between
URLs and controller actions&mdash;are defined right inside the
controller, alongside variables and functions. (By contrast, Rails
puts such information in a separate configuration file,
config/routes.rb.) I also should note that talking about
&ldquo;routes&rdquo; in
the context of a JavaScript application is a bit strange, because the
whole point of such an application is that you stay within the same
URL. Thus, routes in Backbone.js refer to the portion of the URL
following the hash (#) character, originally intended to be used as a
named anchor, but today used more by JavaScript.
</p><p>
This means that a route of <tt  >""</tt> (that is, the empty string) will be run by
default when your application is opened. A route of
<tt  >abc</tt> will be run
when the URL ends with #abc (entered manually in the URL, or from
within a link), and a route of <tt  >abc/:def</tt> will be run when the URL
ends with #abc/SOMETHING, where SOMETHING can be anything at all and
is passed as a parameter to the function invoked by the controller.
</p><p>
Controllers, like models, collections and views, are objects defined
by Backbone.js, which you extend in order to use. A simple controller
might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AppController = Backbone.Controller.extend({
routes: {
    "" : "index",
    "say/:something" : "say"
},

index: function() {
  alert("Now invoked controller index");
},

say: function(something) {
  alert("You said " + something + "!");
}

});
</pre>
</p><p>
This controller has two defined routes. If the hash character isn't
present, it will invoke the &ldquo;index&rdquo; function. If the hash
character is there, and if there is the word &ldquo;say&rdquo;, a parameter and
then some text following it, it will invoke the &ldquo;say&rdquo; function,
printing the contents of the parameter.
</p><p>
Notice that the routes here are extremely flexible. You aren't
restricted to the standard Rails-style RESTful routes. But of course,
you aren't dealing with REST anymore, because this is the application
itself, not a resource for other applications to use. If you insert
the following HTML into your document:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;Internal link &lt;a href="#say/something_at_all"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x262d6e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
this adds a link that will result in the invocation of
<tt  >say("something_at_all")</tt>.
</p><p>
If you put the above into your Backbone.js application and reload,
you'll soon see that...well, nothing happens. That's because
you might have defined the controller object, but you haven't created
it. Thus, you need to put the following line into your code to create a
new AppController object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var myController = new AppController;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now if you try to reload, you'll find that...well, once again, things
won't work. That's because controllers in Backbone.js are integrated
with a history object (Backbone.History), which keeps track of the
URLs you recently visited. If your browser supports the
&ldquo;onhashchange&rdquo; event, Backbone.js will take advantage of it. But
if it doesn't, Backbone.js will poll the browser 20 times each
second, checking to see if the URL has changed, and if so, firing
the appropriate function, based on the current URL.
</p><p>
So, you need to start the Backbone.History object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Backbone.history.start();
</pre>
</p><p>
With all of these in place&mdash;routes inside the controller object
definition, an actual controller object and a running history
object&mdash;Backbone.js springs into action. If you simply go to the URL for
your page, the <tt  >""</tt> (empty string) route will execute the
&ldquo;index&rdquo;
function.
</p><p>
In a real-world application, you don't want the index function to put
up an alert box. Rather, you'll almost certainly want it to load any
data that already might have been saved on the server. In other
words, after you have initialized all of your objects, you'll want to
create the controller, which then will load objects from the remote
server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x262dbb8"></a>
Saving and Loading</h2></div></div><p>
If you haven't quite grasped what we're doing here, consider this. In
a typical server-side MVC application, the view is shown to the user,
and the model is grabbed from a database. That hasn't changed here,
except that the &ldquo;user&rdquo; for this Rails application is the Backbone.js
application. The MVC of the Backbone.js application, by contrast,
expects that its model will come from the server's view output.
</p><p>
How does this Backbone.js program know how to load information from the
server? As mentioned above, you can add a &ldquo;url&rdquo; function to
both your
model and to your collection. For example, the start of your collection
now can look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
   url: "/appointments.json",
</pre>
</p><p>
The .json suffix tells Rails that communication will be done in the
JSON format. When you receive output, it will be in JSON. Backbone.js
can handle XML output as well, but all of the cool kids use JSON
nowadays, so let's do that as well.
</p><p>
Once you tell the Appointments collection its URL, you then can ask it
to retrieve data from that URL and populate itself with Appointment
models. You simply can invoke the built-in fetch() method, which
executes asynchronously, but even better, you can pass the fetch()
method an object with &ldquo;success&rdquo; and &ldquo;error&rdquo; attributes, each of which
contains a function that is executed based on the result from invoking
fetch().
</p><p>
You invoke fetch(), as you might expect, from the controller, on the
&ldquo;index&rdquo; route, which happens when the page is loaded without any
hash tags. In other words, your initial visit to the page will invoke
the controller's &ldquo;index&rdquo; action, which will tell the Appointments
collection to load data from the server via the URL
/appointments.json.
</p><p>
If all you wanted to do was retrieve the list of appointments, 
that would be fine. But you also want to display that list to the
user. This means you need to iterate over each received
appointment object and display it for the user. Fortunately,
Backbone.js is built on top of the Underscore library for JavaScript,
giving you access to all sorts of useful functions, including many for
iteration. So when you retrieve the data, you then can set the
following to be your &ldquo;success&rdquo; function, iterating over each item that
you received from the server, and using a view method to add a new row
to your HTML table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
success: function(response) {
    appview.appointments.each(function(item) {
                  appview.add_appointment_row(item);
              }
                 );
    $("#number-of-appointments").html(appview.appointments.length);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you also will need to save any new appointment that you have
created, using the HTML form, to the server. In order to do this, you
must set the &ldquo;url&rdquo; attribute on the model (as opposed to the
collection). This is a bit more complicated than the URL for the
collection, because it must include the unique ID of the appointment
you are saving, but only if you're updating an existing model.
(Which, I should note, is impossible in the current version of the
software, but it would be a welcome feature in future versions.) If
you're creating a new appointment, you need not send any ID at all:

<pre     class="programlisting">
url : function() {
var base = '/appointments/';
if (this.isNew()) return base;
return base + this.id + '.json';
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, when does a model get saved? Immediately after creating it, at
least in this code. In the view function add_appointment, which
executes (based on a jQuery callback) when someone clicks on the &ldquo;add
appointment&rdquo; button, you first create a new appointment:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var new_appointment =
    new Appointment({person: person, starts_at: starts_at, 
                    &#8618;note: note});
</pre>
</p><p>
You then add this new appointment to your collection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
this.appointments.add(new_appointment);
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you also save the appointment to the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
new_appointment.save();
</pre>
</p><p>
Because your Appointment object is based on the Backbone.js model, it
automatically knows how to save itself to the URL. And sure enough,
when you add a new appointment, an AJAX query automatically fires in
the background, sending a POST or PUT HTTP request to the server (as
appropriate).

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It can take a bit of time to get used to this MVC-squared (or whatever you
wish to call it) paradigm. Once you get used to the fact that your
server is being used for storage, data validation and providing a
good data representation, but that the user interactions are taking
place in the browser and in a separate application, things start to
fall into place. Backbone.js is a great way to get started with this
sort of application, especially if you're familiar with jQuery and
want to use jQuery widgets in your application.

The home page for Backbone.js is on GitHub, at
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone" target="_self">documentcloud.github.com/backbone</a>. This page not only points to 
the code, but also some tutorials and documentation. 
</p><p>
In a step
I hope many other authors will follow, the authors of Backbone.js
put up a copy of the source code, thoroughly commented in a beautiful
format, at <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html" target="_self">documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html</a>.
I encourage anyone interested in Backbone.js to read through the code
and comments. I certainly learned some things about Backbone.js in
particular and JavaScript in general from reading through this code.

A number of tutorials and blog postings describe how to
do interesting things with Backbone.js. One that reviews how to use
Rails 3 with Backbone.js, including some configuration adjustments
that are necessary for it all to work, is
