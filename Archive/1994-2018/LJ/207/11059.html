The Tails Project's The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails)</h2></div></div><p>
Making delirious dictators worldwide quake in their boots, the Tails
Project recently announced numerous improvements to its anonymity-obsessed
Linux distro, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, aka Tails. Now in
version 0.7, Tails is the spiritual successor of the well-known Incognito
Live System and is developed with the support of the Tor Project, an onion
routing project originally developed to protect US military
communications. The live distro, which runs on any PC powerful enough to
run Windows XP, is based on Debian Live and runs directly from CD and/or
USB Flash memory. No trace is left after using Tails, thanks to many
features, such as independent operation of all software and all hardware
drivers from the PC's operating system, no permanent data storage and all
the channeling of all Internet connections through the Tor anonymization
network. &ldquo;With Tails&rdquo;, say the distro developers, &ldquo;we provide a
tongue and a pen protected by state-of-the-art cryptography to guarantee...basic human rights and allow journalists worldwide to work and
communicate freely and without fear of reprisal.&rdquo; The journalists of
these pages humbly salute the valiant effort.

programs out there, and if you're ready to scale the learning curve toward

Eaton Corporation's Eaton 5PX UPS</h2></div></div><p>
Eaton Corporation recently unveiled its new Eaton 5PX UPS, an
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that allows for energy metering down to
the outlet segment level, a feature that the company calls an industry
first. The feature enables IT managers not only to control individual power
outlets or groups of outlets across the network, but also to track and
reduce the power consumption of the protected servers and other IT
equipment. In addition, the 5PX provides 28% more wattage than a
traditional UPS, allowing IT managers to protect a greater number of
devices. Virtualization strategies are supported via seamless integration
with Eaton's Intelligent Power Software Suite. The device is targeted at
small- to medium-business data centers.

Zorin PC</h2></div></div><p>
After waiting like Job for the pre-installed Linux machines we deserved,
we've arrived at a literal Garden of Eden full of worthy choices. A
compelling new offering is the Zorin PC, a new mini-laptop that runs its
own Linux distro, Zorin OS. On the hardware side, the Zorin PC's sexy
selling point is its rotatable touchscreen display, which allows one to
use the device as a regular laptop, a tablet device, an e-reader or a media
center. The display rotates 180&deg;, allowing one to share pictures or videos
with friends. Folding it down as a tablet makes it feel like an Amazon
Kindle. The touchscreen uses digitizer technology, which lets one take
handwritten notes. On the software side, one can order a Windows 7/Zorin OS
dual-boot option, the latter of which comes in Home, Educational and
Business editions. A software repository is included for installing tons of
additional software programs.
