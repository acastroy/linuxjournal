Linux can serve files to any computer, and most never know it's Linux!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a54580.0x2b4c358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Much like a Taster's Choice commercial from the 1980s, Linux advocates
often need to be sneaky in order demonstrate the virtue of open-source
software. It seems that fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) tend to make
people dismiss Linux before it ever gets a chance to prove its worth. The
easiest way to infiltrate an organization with Linux is to attack the
server room.
</p><p>
Although hordes of penguins armed with machine guns sounds like a blockbuster
way to attack a server room, in reality, the best way to get Linux in
the door is by using it to replace a few services previously served
by proprietary operating systems. The simplest service to replace is
usually the Web server. File serving, although a bit more complex, also
is effective. When an entity is growing past its licensing, free file
services really begin to look attractive.

NFS, Simple and Insecure</h2></div></div><p>
NFS often gets a bad rap for being insecure. That's really only because
it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>so insecure</em></span>! Seriously though, even though NFSv4 has added user
authentication, to use NFS in the traditional way, it's important to
realize its shortcomings. Many folks (myself included) still use NFS,
but it's easy to expose your servers to unneeded threat if you don't
understand how it works.
</p><p>
On the server side, you can specify the IP address of the clients
allowed to connect. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon to see someone
use wild cards to allow any and all computers to connect. That's a bad
idea, because NFS (v2 and v3) restricts file access using only standard
user permissions. If I connect to an NFS server with my laptop and
my UID is 501, I'll have access to the files owned by UID 501 on the
server&mdash;without authentication. There are options to restrict the root
user, but that doesn't really restrict anyone. If I want to access files
owned by UID 6224, all I have to do is create a user with that UID,
and I have access. Squashing root access on the server is no security
at all, just an annoyance to potential hackers.
</p><p>
Because restricting the client IP addresses that are allowed to connect
limits the clients to trusted computers, it would seem that NFS is
secure as long as the server is configured correctly. Sadly, that's
not really true either. As there is no way to verify what computer
is using a particular IP, an attacker simply can shut off an allowed
client machine, assign the IP address of that client and connect to
the NFS server quite happily. For that reason, I restrict my NFS usage
to server-to-server sharing on servers in secured locations. Even then,
it's important to think through any potential point of entry.
</p><p>
The reason I bring up NFS sharing is because it's perfect for LTSP. Because
servers in the server room are secure and physically adjacent, NFS is
a simple way to share the /home directory between your LTSP servers.
Configuring NFS is simple. Make sure the NFS server packages and its
dependencies are installed on your server, and the NFS client packages
are installed on your clients. (In this case, by &ldquo;client&rdquo; I mean the
server acting as an NFS client to the file server. Sorry if that sounds
confusing.)
</p><p>
On the server, edit your /etc/exports file. The following example has three
separate shares. See if you can spot the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/home    192.168.1.35(rw)
/iso    192.168.1.*(ro)
/home    192.168.1.*(ro)
</pre>
</p><p>
To activate the shares you've created in your /etc/exports file,
either reboot the server, or type <tt  >/usr/sbin/exportfs
-a</tt> to reload
the configuration.
</p><p>
In the above example, the first line allows the client with the IP
address of 192.168.1.35 to have full read/write access to the /home
directory on the server. This is about as secure as you can make NFS on
the server. You also can specify hosts with DNS entries, but then you
risk compromise by DNS spoofing.
</p><p>
The second line shares the /iso directory in read-only mode to anyone on
the 192.168.1.0/24 network. The wild card here means what you'd expect, and
anyone in that range can connect. Making this read-only does protect the
content of the folder from being molested, but it doesn't stop anyone from
reading and copying the contents. In this case, that's the desired result.
</p><p>
The third line looks to be safe, because it's shared only in read-only
mode. As any client on the network can connect, however, that means
every folder in the /home directory, so that means usually all your users have their
personal files exposed! Granted, no one can change the files because they
are read-only, but with that single line, you've effectively given free
access to everyone's files&mdash;definitely not a good idea.
</p><p>
On the client computer, NFS shares are mounted just like any other
partition or filesystem. To make a mount permanent and automatic, simply
edit /etc/fstab and add a line like:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#&lt;server:/share&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt; &lt;filesys_type&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;dump&gt; &lt;pass&gt;
192.168.1.5:/home    /home    auto    defaults  0  0

</pre>
</p><p>
To mount the share, either reboot the client machine or run
<tt  >mount -a</tt> as root. It's important to note that like any filesystem
mounting, the /home directory must be empty in order to mount the NFS
share in that location.
</p><p>
The above example tells the client to try connecting to the server
192.168.1.5 (it also can be a DNS name). Once connected, it tries to mount
the /home share on the local /home directory. The filesystem type is set
to <tt  >auto</tt>, and the options in this case are set to
<tt  >defaults</tt>. The last
two zeros are the <tt  >dump</tt> and
<tt  >pass</tt> options. The options along with dump
and pass settings are tweakable, but beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
When NFS is used in a closely controlled server-to-server scenario like
this, it makes sharing home directories very convenient. Once you realize
the shortcomings of the &ldquo;security&rdquo; NFS offers, it is possible to include
it in very specific scenarios in your infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a54580.0x2b4cfb8"></a>
Samba, or CIFS</h2></div></div><p>
Samba is one of those programs that can wash your car, feed the dog, fly
a space shuttle and also serve files. It can act as a Primary Domain
Controller (not an Active Directory server yet, unfortunately), along
with sharing printers and files. For the purposes of this article, let's take a cursory
look at file serving&mdash;specifically, sharing the /home directory for your
users. By installing Samba on the same file server you installed NFS,
those same files can be shared to Windows clients. Oh, and Samba
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span>
support user authentication for security!
</p><p>
Configuring Samba could easily turn into a five-part series, but if your goal
is simply to serve files in your /home directory, I recommend starting
with the default configuration. If you're running a Debian variant, I
recommend installing the libpam-smbpass package along with the samba
server packages. It is a neat little package that keeps the separate UNIX
and Samba passwords in sync. It's certainly possible to configure other
authentication schemes, but in its simplest form, keeping user names and
passwords in sync with the underlying system is ideal.
</p><p>
If you open the /etc/smb.conf file, you'll see some settings in the
<tt  >[global]</tt> section that can be tweaked to best fit your network. Namely,
you can set the NETBIOS name and a few other tweakable configurations to
better define your server. Even those changes, however, are not required.
Simply scrolling down and uncommenting the following three lines will get
you a functional Samba server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no
</pre>
</p><p>
After changing those lines, you should be able to go to a Windows machine
and browse your server as if it were a Microsoft server (Figure 1).
As I mentioned earlier, Samba is a vastly powerful system. Sharing
your /home directories to users is barely scratching the surface. Still,
even with this little bit of setup, it's quite useful.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11288f1.large.jpg"><img src="11288f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. As far as Windows is concerned, it's connected to another
Windows machine.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a54580.0x2b4d488"></a>
Fruity Computers Too!</h2></div></div><p>
With modern OS X machines, connecting to Samba shares is simple. In fact,
OS X does its own magic to preserve the resource fork of its files by
adding a ._filename file to Samba shares. If you're not familiar with
Apple's data fork and resource fork file structure, don't worry. The
only frustrating part is all those dot-underscore files everywhere!
</p><p>
If you prefer your file sharing to be native, there's an app for
that. As it's not only Windows servers that you may hope to replace with
Linux, it's nice to have an Apple native file server even if OS X can
connect to Samba. Netatalk is the server program that provides file and
print services for Apple products. Apple actually uses LDAP for its
Open Directory server, but the configuration is proprietary and uses
closed-source management tools. So for the short term, the only thing
you can do seamlessly is share files and printers.
</p><p>
The package that comes with most Debian variants comes preconfigured
for serving home directories. A simple <tt  >apt-get install
netatalk</tt> will
install and configure the server without any other effort required on
your part. Users then can connect to your server as if it were an Apple-branded file server and never know the difference. For production use,
you likely will want to edit the configuration files to set the name of
your server, but it really does usually work right out of the box. OS X
users often claim their system &ldquo;just works&rdquo;, and you can claim the same about
your open-source server program for their platform!

But I Use Linux for a Client!</h2></div></div><p>
You've probably noticed that my solution for Linux clients appears to be
the most limited. Rest assured, if you're running Linux on a client that
isn't appropriate for NFS, you can connect via Samba without any problems.
It might be possible to connect to a Netatalk server from Linux, but
I've never seen a reason to try. If you don't want to use Samba, there
are other less-common ways to connect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a54580.0x2b4d7f8"></a>
SSHFS</h2></div></div><p>
LTSP thin clients mount a user's home directory using this method. Years
ago, if the thin client had to access the /home folder, it was mounted
via NFS. For reasons I outlined above, it's clear that isn't a really
good idea. As its name suggests, SSHFS mounts a remote filesystem over
SSH. This makes mounting very flexible, but it's important to keep in
mind that shares mounted over a slow WAN connection often are difficult to use,
especially on a regular basis.
</p><p>
In order to use SSHFS in a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system, you need to
install the sshfs package. Just like NFS, the folder on which you choose to
mount needs to be empty or the mounting process will fail. (Note:
the Ubuntu Web site claims users must be in the &ldquo;fuse&rdquo; group in order
to use sshfs filesystems, but I have not found that to be the case.)
To mount a remote filesystem:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sshfs user@remote.system.com:/remote/folder /home/user/local_folder
</pre>
</p><p>
Once authenticated, the folder /home/user/local_folder (or whatever
folder you chose) will be mounted remotely to /remote/folder on the
server. Access speed is dependent on network speed, but the files should
work the same as any other mounted filesystem. It's really cool!
</p><p>
In order to unmount, use the <tt  >fusermount</tt>
command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
fusermount -u /home/user/local_folder
</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible to add sshfs filesystems to the /etc/fstab file in much
the same way that you add an NFS share. Because sshfs uses FUSE, a userspace
file-mounting system, it's generally used for individual users as opposed
to system mounts. As with most things Linux, this is flexible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a54580.0x2b4dc18"></a>
Old-School FTP</h2></div></div><p>
FTP isn't really ideal for file transfers, mainly because it transfers
user names and passwords in plain text. Linux still supports FTP
file servers, and most systems come with FTP logins jailed in a chroot
environment for each user. Although this protocol is insecure,
unfortunately,
you need to use it sometimes for programs that support only traditional
FTP. If I have to set up an FTP server, I prefer vsftp, but I won't go
through the setup process here because FTP is just not a great protocol
to use.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;proper&rdquo; thing to do is use SFTP, which for Linux users is as
simple as having an SSH server installed. SFTP is handled by the OpenSSH
d&aelig;mon on Linux servers, and setting it up on most servers is as simple as
doing nothing. If there are security concerns about exposing your server
to the Internet, it is possible to configure SSH for chroot jails per
user as well. Thankfully, with SSH everything is encrypted, so sniffing
the network isn't a concern. Unfortunately, no amount of securing can
protect your system from compromised passwords, so make sure your users
don't have a habit of using passwords like 1234 for your system.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The server room is by far the easiest place to replace expensive
proprietary operating systems with Linux. In fact, the days of sneaking
Linux into the server room are largely behind us. Most bosses, even
the technologically illiterate ones, expect Linux to be in the server
room. They might not know what Linux does, but they know they should
have it! If your institution is outgrowing its licensing, or if you'd just
like to replace &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; with &ldquo;open&rdquo;, file servers are a great
place to start. If done carefully, your users will never know. Be sure
to mention to your boss how much you've saved in licensing and support,
because upper management always likes to brag about how much
the department has saved!
