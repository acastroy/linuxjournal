Too Esoteric?</h4><p>
As a former print subscriber, I have been getting some free views of
the digital version.
The problem I have has nothing to do with print vs. digital, but rather
the content. As an individual managing several Linux computers, I am by
definition a system administrator, but on a small scale.
</p><p>
When I first subscribed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, each issue had at least one, and usually
a few articles that I could get useful information from. But
as time went on, things seemed to get more esoteric, more advanced than what
I could actually use, so when I realized that a half-year's issues had
absolutely nothing of interest, I quit <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
</p><p>
I still can relate to Doc Searls' pearls, but not anything else. I write
this having just viewed the System Administration issue, but the same has been true
for the last several issues. I think you're out of touch with my segment
of Linux users.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Greg   <br><br>
</p><p>
Wow Greg, we're really sorry to hear that. Our goal is to be relevant for
as much of our readership as possible. We recently started The Open-Source
Classroom column, hoping to cover an area we thought might be lacking. At
the very least, hopefully you'll still garner some good information from
our Web site. Thanks for letting us know. Without feedback, we have no hope
of meeting our readers' needs.&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x2a53580.0x2b4b510"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x2a53580.0x2b4b510"></a>
Congrats on the Digital Issues</h4><p>
I still don't get why people are whining about the digital vs. paper
issue. I personally receive more than 90% of my information digitally,
and I read a lot of books (and other stuff) on my BeBook Neo without
problems&mdash;or without any annoying problems. Even on my 24" desktop,
reading the PDF is
okay.
And maybe the most important thing is because I'm from Eastern Europe,
the paper subscription was not possible for me (postal issues, delays and
so on). Because of the digital edition, I'm the proud owner
of a subscription now.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Florin   <br><br>
</p><p>
Awesome! We're always happy to hear success stories. Thanks for
sharing.&mdash;Ed.

Why Not Slackware?</h4><p>
I've been a subscriber for at least about ten years, perhaps longer,
since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux Journal</em></span> folded. This is one
magazine I read thoroughly,
because it agrees with what I use a lot of, Linux. I also use the Slackware
distribution thoroughly. So the fact remains, why not cover that one? I
admit,
it's not as easy to use as Ubuntu, but given the fact that Slackware
wants the user to do everything that the user wants to do, it just works.
There are even third-party repositories.
So ideally, the magazine should start being more distribution-agnostic,
and if a specific distro is needed, use that one (Slackware). 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gregg C. Levine  <br><br>
</p><p>
You make a valid point, but it's rough for us to force distro-agnosticism
on our authors, because they're writing from their experiences. Because Ubuntu
and its variants are the most commonly used, it's what we see more often
than not. We will continue to strive for non-distro-specific solutions, but
we'd rather have accurate articles geared toward a specific distro than commit
errors in an attempt to stay &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo;.&mdash;Ed.

Downloading <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> via wget</h4><p>
In the April 2012 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, Bob Johnson, in the Letters section, states that he's having
a hard time downloading <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> issues via
<tt  >wget</tt>, as he would rather read the
PDF file in an independent reader rather than in a browser plugin.
I perfectly agree with him, and I have no problem downloading the PDF via
<tt  >wget</tt>.
Here is how I do it:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
I click on the link received via e-mail.
</p></li><li><p>
In the browser that opens, I copy the entire address bar (via Ctrl-A,
Ctrl-C). The URL is something like
&ldquo;http://download.linuxjournal.com/pdf/get-doc.php?code=...&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
I then type <tt  >wget</tt> and paste the URL, with one very
important precaution though. The URL must be enclosed in double quotes, as the parameters are separated by
an ampersand (&amp;), which has a special meaning under UNIX/Linux.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It works like a charm! So, if you have the chance to pass that information
on to Bob, that would be great!


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bruno   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks Bruno! I suspect a procmail recipe and a little sed/awk magic could
make the process completely automatic.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Download with wget Possible Solution</h4><p>
I was reading the April 2012 issue, and regarding the letter from Bob Johnson
titled &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Download with
wget?&rdquo;, I think I may have a solution:
the cliget extension for Firefox
(<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cliget" target="_self">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cliget</a>).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jordi Clariana  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks Jordi. I suspect we'll hear back from Bob. Hopefully, one of these
solutions works for him. Thanks again for the suggestion!&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Android App</h4><p>
After checking many readers on the market for my Android phone (Kindle,
Aldiko, PDF-based and so on), I have to admit that the best interface still
is yours (Texterity's). Its reflowed text is very good; the graphics look
great, and the Navigator (index) is a great way to move between articles.
Would it be too much to ask that you try to improve this application further?
As great as the Navigator is, if I switch to another task, say to check a
phone number, I have to go find the article I was reading again, and
the location I was at. Make it remember my last location.
</p><p>
If I do not have connectivity (such as on an airplane), I cannot access the
content, as there is some check for connectivity when the application starts. Of course,
it was made by developers who do not know what it is not to have an always-on
data link, but that is still the case. My data is cached; that's not the
issue (I can't even access the library). Make it stop &ldquo;calling
home&rdquo; when
the app is launched for the first time.
</p><p>
Finally, moving between articles in reflowed mode is too easy. What do I mean?
The slightest scroll along the x-axis sends me to the next article. The
fact that I'm reading on a phone probably exacerbates that (smaller
screen), but it still takes 1/4" or less on a 4.3" screen.
</p><p>
That is it.
The native app works great; now please fork some love to Texterity so those
little annoyances can be fixed (so I can comply with the FAA and actually
turn off my phone).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Pablo   <br><br>
</p><p>
We'll be sure to pass your note to the Texterity folks. I think the
&ldquo;calling home&rdquo; that happens is Texterity checking for new content, but I'll
admit, I'm not sure that's all it's doing. Thanks for the
feedback!&mdash;Ed.

Yet More Digital Edition Whining</h4><p>
You guys do seem diligent and serious about &ldquo;going digital
right&rdquo;,
providing alternative formats and access techniques for maximum
convenience. And, I suppose that you are getting a bit sick of digital
edition whining. I trust that reader loyalty has kept this change from
hurting your circulation numbers too much. There are two aspects of this
that, taken together, bring up a question in my mind: you are quite willing
to go to miles of extra trouble to get all alternative formats right, and
the reason for going digital is economic. So why not see paper is an
alternative format&mdash;one that, because of raw economic reality, commands a
premium price? Some of your readers (not me!) are quite wealthy (some even
have been made that way by application of skills promulgated in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>). There
are any number of boutique publish-on-demand technologies that could turn
PDF into paper, for a (probably large) extra cost.
</p><p>
Whatever that cost, some population of those you are losing could choose
and would choose to pay it. Even if the cost was so prohibitive that
practically no one would choose it, at least the choice would be preserved,
and people could feel good about saving themselves money by moving on to
digital&mdash;rather than the money being saved all going to your corporation.
Get your bean counters out of their cages and cost out a &ldquo;boutique
paper&rdquo;
alternative that pays its toll and offer it to your readership! You are
doing so much else &ldquo;right&rdquo; with going digital, I hate to see you miss this
trick.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dave Carew  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks Dave, we really have been working hard on the digital versions. It's
hard to remember the days when we only had one layout to work on! As far as
the print-on-demand aspect goes, we haven't had much discussion internally
about it. I always assumed folks would just send their PDF files to the
boutique printers if they wanted paper. It occurs to me, however, that I
might be putting my foot squarely in my mouth. Perhaps a commercially
produced PDF like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> would be rejected as a copyright violation
or something. We'll have to look into it.&mdash;Ed.

Digital Subscription Side Effect</h4><p>
I would think that the geeks all would have loved the digital subscription.
I guess not. I enjoyed reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> before bedtime. Now I do it on a
tablet. A funny thing happened&mdash;a side effect. I started questioning
myself for keeping old magazines around when I can always buy a DVD of the
archives if I really need to. I had only a few <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>s, because I bought them
from the bookstore and have kept a few hard copies. Now I subscribe to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> digital version. This spring cleaning has prompted me to throw out 
a hundred pounds of archived magazines with topics on radios and electronics and all those
IT magazines that presented peripheral articles with no meat. I even had
my old NT magazines that I gladly discarded from the 1990s. Thanks
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> for a
great product. Keep developing, keep improving and keep your eye on the
future. See you at the next SCALE.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Roman Kamienski  <br><br>
</p><p>
That's awesome, Roman. I still get a few paper magazines at work, and I
find myself getting annoyed when I misplace them. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is always
in my pocket now, and on my computer only a click away. I think digital
magazines are making me even <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> forgetful!&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x2a53580.0x2b44268"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x2a53580.0x2b44268"></a>
E-Reader Downloads</h4><p>
I'm sure you're tired of the messages regarding the whole e-reader topic.
At first I was dismayed because I love the portability of print, but now I
am squarely in the e-reader camp and all of its benefits. Kudos on the
digital version. My one gripe, however, is the mechanism by which I can
download the EPUB files for my NOOK. The default browser in the NOOK
doesn't seem to want to download the files. Is there a way this can be
fixed? I keep forgetting to download the issues and sideload them via the
laptop. Thanks, and keep up the great work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dave Heebner  <br><br>
</p><p>
I don't have a NOOK myself with which to experiment, but perhaps if our
group effort to download automatically with wget pans out, an additional
step to e-mail the downloaded file as a regular attachment would
work.
</p><p>
I'm beginning to picture in my mind a script that scans an IMAP server on
the first of every month, and based on configuration options, will save and
re-mail the digital versions to the reader as plain attachments.&mdash;Ed.

How to Introduce My Son's School to Linux?</h4><p>
I've often heard Richard Stallman argue
about why schools should use
free software instead of proprietary software. My kids are very young, and
they haven't been introduced to computers yet, but I would like their school
to start considering GNU/Linux as an alternative to Windows, but I don't know
how to do that. I would really appreciate any information to achieve this
goal.
Maybe you could write an article about this or point me to a
previous article that you already have?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Carlos Le Mare  <br><br>
</p><p>
Your timing is perfect! My Open-Source Classroom column this month touches
on one way to start introducing Linux in a server room. If you haven't won
the hearts of the IT staff, however, it might be rough. If you read the
past few months of my column regarding LTSP, you might think about a small
classroom-sized install. You'd still need permission from the Principal and
IT staff, but if you find the right teacher, you could start a pretty
powerful grass-roots campaign. Good luck!&mdash;Ed.

Child-Friendly Linux?</h4><p>
My six-year-old has a computer with Ubuntu installed (thanks to dad, of
course), and now I am wondering how I can secure the computer.
She goes on YouTube and mostly stays on secure channels, but sometimes some
not-very-friendly channels come up.
Could you describe some ways to make the Web experience
for kids better?
I have tried the 0.0.0.0 in the hosts file for YouTube, but that stops my
kid from even going there, and as I mentioned before, there are some channels that
are meant for kids.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Trond Huso  <br><br>
</p><p>
Since YouTube is completely controlled by Google, filtering specific
aspects of the site is challenging. You might check out YouTube's
education-specific site though: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/education" target="_self">www.youtube.com/education</a>. If that doesn't help, there
are sites like <a href="http://www.schooltube.com" target="_self">www.schooltube.com</a>, but they don't have the same amount of
content.&mdash;Ed.

Is Synapse Launcher Dead?</h4><p>
I started using Ubuntu and Synapse a little while ago. I learned the
Synapse program, and I was very happy with it, and I wanted to give some
ideas to
the Synapse team. I sent my idea to the launchpad page, but no one replied. I
found one of the main developers on his personal blog, and he answered me,
&ldquo;I'm really sorry, but we are both busy with our jobs, so at the moment we
are no longer active on Synapse.&rdquo; You can see it here:
<a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/synapse-project/+question/192032" target="_self">https://answers.launchpad.net/synapse-project/+question/192032</a>.
</p><p>
I'm very sad that the project is practically dead&mdash;no bug fixes and no updates.
Can you let others know? Maybe some other developers would like to
continue the project. I know Synapse has many users, and if people know
this,
they might want to join the project. Thank you.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Emre   <br><br>
</p><p>
Sadly, this happens to many, many projects. Often wonderful applications
are developed by overworked folks in their spare time. Once that spare time
goes away, so do updates. If there is a large user base, you might consider
posting to the e-mail list or support forums and hope someone else will take
over. I wish I had better news.&mdash;Ed.

Correction</h4><p>
In my article &ldquo;System Administration of the Watson
Supercomputer&rdquo; in the April 2012 issue, I made an error regarding
the corpus size. I mistakenly had it as 400TB, but the corpus size is actually 59GB.
