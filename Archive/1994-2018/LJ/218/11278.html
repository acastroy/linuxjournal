Now that we have a script that can help with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and the like, it
turns out it's helpful for any game that involves words. Let's see how I
tap into it to get an edge in the popular new iOS game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddd580.0x1ed5460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More words. This time I noticed that many of my friends and family are
engrossed in a popular new iPad and iPhone game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span>. It's a sort of digital version of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pictionary</em></span>, but what
makes it interesting to me is that you're presented with a sketch and
have to guess what it is, but you're given a set of letters and spaces
that clue you in to how long the word is.
See Figure 1 for an example.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11278f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. What the heck is this sketch from <span  class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span>?
</p></div></div><p>
You can see in Figure 1 that you're presented with a set of letter
tiles and a blank space for the word. In this case, you can see that the word
is five letters long and that the set of letters from which you can choose
is A D E E K N N S V W X X. By the duplication of letters, you can conclude that
if the word to guess includes more than one occurrence of a letter, each
letter has to appear.
</p><p>
This is, of course, a simple variation on the word selection programs
we've been writing during the past few months as part of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> program, so let's see what's involved in making
this cheat work. Let's assume that the words are in our existing
dictionary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddd580.0x1ed5a38"></a>
findwords.sh</h2></div></div><p>
In my previous few articles, we've developed a handy script called
<tt  >findwords.sh</tt> that you give a set of letters
and it
tells you what words could be made out of those tiles&mdash;for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ findword.sh sejdowa
++ word dowse can be constructed from the letters sejdowa
++ word jawed can be constructed from the letters sejdowa
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, those are particularly bad letters for any
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>-like game when
there are only two words possible that are at least five letters long (by
default, the script omitted all words four-or-less-letters long because
usually there are a ton of them).
</p><p>
It seems like we could apply the same script to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span> without
modification, however, simply by listing all the letters possible&mdash;more
than seven, needless to say. Here's what happens when I do that, with a
wee bit of tweaking the output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ findword.sh adeeknnsvwxx
++ word ANNEX can be constructed, length = 5
++ word ASKEW can be constructed, length = 5
++ word DENSE can be constructed, length = 5
++ word EAVES can be constructed, length = 5
++ word EVADE can be constructed, length = 5
++ word KNAVE can be constructed, length = 5
++ word KNEAD can be constructed, length = 5
++ word NAKED can be constructed, length = 5
++ word NEEDS can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SEDAN can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SENNA can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SEVEN can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SKEWED can be constructed, length = 6
++ word SNAKE can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SNEAK can be constructed, length = 5
++ word SWANK can be constructed, length = 5
++ word VEXED can be constructed, length = 5
++ word WAKEN can be constructed, length = 5
++ word WAXEN can be constructed, length = 5
++ word WEAKEN can be constructed, length = 6
++ word WEAVE can be constructed, length = 5
++ word WEEDS can be constructed, length = 5
</pre>
</p><p>
The only tweak I'd make is that we should specify the length of the
word and have it show us only matches that could fit; showing a six-letter
word like WEAKEN isn't very useful.
</p><p>
To fix that, let's add an optional second parameter to the script that
specifies target word length. Being lazy, I'll make that parameter #2
and use the extraordinarily sloppy parameter test of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -z "$2" ] ; then
  targetlength=$2
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Yeah, yeah, <tt  >getopt</tt> would be better, but as I've discussed
before, sometimes scripting is more about getting the job done than it is
about being optimal in your coding strategy.
</p><p>
The main loop continues to increase in complication too, now adding the
<tt  >targetlength</tt> parameter:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for word in $(cat $possibilities)
do
length=$(echo $word | wc --c)
  length="$(( $length - 1 ))"
  idx=1
  while [ $idx -le $length ] ; do
    letter=$(echo $word | cut -c$idx)
    occurrences $letter $word
    wordfreq=$freq  # number of times letter occurs #1
    occurrences $letter $1 # and letter occurrences #2
    uword=$(echo $word | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]')
    if [ $wordfreq -gt $freq ] ; then
      break # get out of the "nearest" loop
    else
      if [ $idx -eq $length ] ; then
        if [ $targetlength -ne 0 ] ; then
          if [ $length -eq $targetlength ] ; then
            echo "word $word can be constructed"
          fi
        else
          echo "word $uword can be constructed, length = $length"
        fi
      fi
    fi
    idx=$(( $idx + 1 )) # increment loop counter
  done
done
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're comparing this with the previous versions of this loop,
you'll notice a few changes, including the <tt  >uword</tt> assignment
that converts words from lowercase to uppercase. Most important, if
<tt  >targetlength</tt> is nonzero, the script will list only words that match the
target length.
</p><p>
Now the results are a bit trimmed down, but let's go a bit further and try
to get all the results on a single line by simply having the word itself
output, adding a before-and-after wrapper line, and pushing the entire output
through the ever-handy <tt  >fmt</tt> command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ findword.sh adeeknnsvwxx 5 | fmt
Possibilities: ANNEX, ASKEW, DENSE, EAVES, EVADE, KNAVE, KNEAD, NAKED,
NEEDS, SEDAN, SENNA, SEVEN, SNAKE, SNEAK, SWANK, VEXED, WAKEN, WAXEN,
WEAVE, WEEDS, out of the letter set adeeknnsvwxx.
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a good place to stop. Oh, and did you figure out the solution to
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw Something</em></span> puzzle yet? I hope so!
</p><p>
The only problem is that this isn't a great cheat in this
particular instance, because one of the things that makes <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span>
popular is that it uses a lot of contemporary words like Lady Gaga, NASCAR
and JayZ&mdash;words that aren't going to be in our dictionary.
Maybe that's another reason it's popular&mdash;unlike <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span>, it's hard to cheat at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Draw
Something</em></span>.
Ah well, it's still an interesting extension to our earlier word finder
script!
