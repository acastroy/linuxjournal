Digium Inc.'s G100 &amp; G200 VoIP Gateways</h2></div></div><p>
Digium, Inc.'s newly released standalone G100 &amp; G200 VoIP Gateways are an
integral part of the company's mission to simplify further the deployment of
Asterisk-based, converged-media networks. The gateways, which are built on a
combination of the Asterisk open-source communications engine and an advanced
embedded platform, complement the heretofore standard solution of telephony
ports as interface cards on standard PC hardware. The power-saving embedded
design features a highly efficient digital signal processor (DSP) to handle all
media-related operations. The G100 &amp; G200 are built to support both TDM-to-SIP
and SIP-to-TDM applications. Digium says that the combination of the company's
intuitive user interface, the flexibility of Asterisk and the purpose-built
media processing capabilities of the DSP results in a gateway platform that
outperforms the &ldquo;dated designs&rdquo; found in the market today.

GrammaTech Inc.'s CodeSonar</h2></div></div><p>
While text editors typically show a scant few lines of code, the upgraded
CodeSonar and its new architecture visualization system from GrammaTech,
Inc.,
scales to millions of lines of code. The new system tackles the growing
complexity of large software systems, allowing developers to test and analyze
the interrelationships between elements of source code via visual inspection
and analysis of their software. Real-time, fluid transitions allow for the
visualization of massive data sets at a wide range of levels of abstraction.
GrammaTech says that CodeSonar goes beyond what is offered in other
visualization tools, which are effective at displaying small-scale parts of the
program structure, such as fragments of class hierarchies and subsets of the
call graph. CodeSonar, says the company, is unique in its ability to show
whole-program structures as well as deal with complexity found in certain
smaller projects. CodeSonar visualization runs through a standard Web
client,
such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer.

6Wind's 6WINDGate Cloud Edition</h2></div></div><p>
The new 6WINDGate Cloud Edition from 6WIND is targeted at suppliers of both
physical and virtual network appliances for data centers. These suppliers, says
6WIND, are under intense pressure not only to deliver new cloud-optimized
solutions with the best possible cost/performance but also to accelerate their
development schedules and be early to market in new product categories.
Building on the success of its Mobile Edition software, which already
is deployed in two-thirds of LTE networks worldwide, 6WIND has developed the Cloud
Edition to apply its unique technology to address critical performance and
scalability challenges faced by cloud infrastructure providers. The 6WINDGate
Cloud Edition product includes an integrated suite of optimized networking
protocols matched to the specific requirements of network appliances. These
include protocol termination, QoS, routing, switching, security, tunneling and
VPN functions. Support for industry-standard hypervisors also is included.

Bruce W. Perry's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fitness for Geeks</em></span> (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;There's more to being a geek than most people think when they hear the
word&rdquo;, says O'Reilly Media&mdash;which is why the publishing company sees no sign
of irony in the title of its new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fitness for Geeks: Real Science, Great
Nutrition, and Good Health</em></span> by author Bruce W. Perry. The book is a treatise on
the science behind one's health and exercise routine, which O'Reilly says
will appeal to a broad audience of scientists, programmers and people with 
inquisitive minds who want to experiment with health the way they tinker with
technology. By applying the same technical approach they use to debug software
or hack hardware, readers will learn both what to do and why it works. Whether
they have an established exercise routine and want to dig deeper to realize the
physiology behind it, or if they're just looking for a way to get away from the
computer to exercise in a manner that speaks to them, this book helps readers
discover a new method for building and maintaining fitness and a healthy
lifestyle.

Michael J. Hammel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Artist's Guide to GIMP</em></span>,
2nd ed. (No Starch
Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Michael J. Hammel is one of the ur-names associated with the GIMP graphic design
and photo manipulation application. Back in the 1990s, the producers of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> published the first edition of Hammel's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Artist's Guide to 
GIMP</em></span>, which No Starch Press recently released in a fully updated 2nd edition.
The new edition, which carries the subtitle &ldquo;Creative Techniques for
Photographers, Artists, and Designers&rdquo;, illustrates how to put the
GIMP's
powerful tools to work to produce professional-looking advertisements, apply
impressive photographic effects, and design cool logos and text effects. Hammel
demystifies the notoriously challenging elements of the GIMP not with a boring
list of menu paths and options but with step-by-step tutorials that help to
accomplish important tasks. After a crash course in GIMP's core tools like
brushes, patterns, selections, layers, modes and masks, the reader will learn
photographic and Web-design techniques, as well as type and advertising
effects. Readers of all levels will be inspired by the art that they can
create.

BeyondTrust's PowerBroker Servers Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
The new PowerBroker Servers Enterprise solution from BeyondTrust was created to
confront the challenges related to managing Linux and UNIX user accounts in
heterogeneous networks. BeyondTrust describes PowerBroker as &ldquo;a
cost-effective approach to allow organizations to seamlessly manage privileged
access on Linux and UNIX systems across dynamic physical, virtual and cloud
environments through Microsoft Active Directory&rdquo;. The result is a reduction
in costs, complexity and susceptibility to security breaches, especially inside
jobs. PowerBroker provides an intuitive GUI to implement privileged access
policy and the ability to log, monitor and report on all user access and
activities. This approach empowers IT organizations with the ability to
delegate root tasks and authorization on Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X platforms
without ever disclosing the highly sensitive root password. Furthermore,
businesses of every size and industry are better able to satisfy critical
internal and external compliance requirements and regulations, including SOX,
HIPAA, GLBA, PCI DSS and FISMA.

Napatech Time Synchronization Endpoint</h2></div></div><p>
As the world moves to 10GbE and 40GbE, and the number of packets that need to
be analyzed in data centers and telecom reach tens of millions per second, the
need for time stamping with nanosecond-level precision is growing. Enter
Napatech's new Time Synchronization Endpoint (NTTSE), a new time
synchronization endpoint unit supporting the IEEE1588 PTP time synchronization
protocol. NTTSE can be installed as an IEEE1588 PTP slave, allowing Napatech
customers to synchronize all appliances in their data center using Napatech
intelligent network adapters to an IEEE1588 PTP master. NTTSE is suitable for
applications in which high-precision time stamping of captured packets is
required, such as latency monitoring for financial networks, telecom protocol
analysis or Ethernet network performance monitoring.

S.E.C.U.R.E. Virtual Computing Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Three disparate companies&mdash;Fritz Technologies, LynuxWorks and
TransLattice&mdash;joined forces to create the new S.E.C.U.R.E. Virtual Computing Platform
to meet the exacting requirements of sensitive cloud deployments in government
and commercial data centers. The companies posit that S.E.C.U.R.E., short for
Secure, Enterprise, Cross-Domain, Unified, Resilient Environment, &ldquo;creates
the ideal environment for situations requiring secure hosting of applications,
geographic redundancy of applications and data, and secure cross-domain
transfer of information.&rdquo; At S.E.C.U.R.E.'s core is Fritz Technologies'
secure server-based separation kernel (SepKer), which was created working with
the LynxSecure 4.0 separation kernel from LynuxWorks. SepKer virtualization is
complemented by TransLattice Application Platform (TAP), a
&ldquo;lattice&rdquo;
application and data distribution solution that adds resiliency and efficiency.
TAP fully distributes both the application and its data across multiple VMs and
system platforms within a secure domain, ensuring nonstop operations, even in
the case of the loss of one or more components of the computing lattice.
