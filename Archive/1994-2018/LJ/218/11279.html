<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #218, June 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>KVM API</b></span> has been accruing cruft for many
years, a result of the
natural process of being an actively developed project and having a
lot of crazy deep requirements for virtualizing systems. It's hard to
just up and redo an API that's already well established though, so <span   class="bold"><b>Avi
Kivity</b></span> suggested either a thought experiment of how it might be
done or, at most, a co-API that would sit side by side with the
original one for several years.
</p><p>
Interesting enough, one of the things people favored in the original
crufty interface was the ease of producing cruft. Specifically, Avi
wanted to migrate away from <span   class="bold"><b>ioctls</b></span> as the primary interface and
replace them with system calls. This would be cleaner than the
crawling chaos of ioctls, but folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander
Graf</b></span> and others
argued that KVM still was under hot development and definitely
was going to need an unknown vector of extensions, and ioctls made that
kind of development very easy.
</p><p>
So, this is more of a negative news story: hot flash&mdash;KVM interface to
remain unchanged! But still, it's interesting because Avi seems to be
right. The KVM API has a lot of unnecessary craziness, such as the
way the virtualized CPU state is handled. The current cluster-bomb of
ioctls in that area could be replaced by just two system calls that
would operate on a single orderly data structure. And, there are other
similar areas he points out. But apparently, the pace of development
will have to slow down, and the interfaces stabilize, before those cleanups
really will be practical.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rakib Mullick</b></span> is working on a new approach to load balancing between
multiple CPUs on an <span   class="bold"><b>SMP</b></span> system. The <span   class="bold"><b>Barbershop Load Distribution</b></span> (BLD)
algorithm keeps track of any change to the load on each CPU and
always assigns new processes, and processes coming in from swap-space,
to the least-loaded CPU.
</p><p>
Because the preferred CPU is known instantly at the time a process
needs to be assigned, the BLD has a speed of O(1), which means it
takes the same amount of time to identify the appropriate CPU,
regardless of whether there are 2 or 2,000,000 CPUs from which to choose.
</p><p>
As Rakib explains it, this is load balancing without load balancing,
because the actual effort to balance the load never takes place. The
appropriate CPU simply is picked from an ordered list of all CPUs
that already has been sorted by total load.
</p><p>
His code is still under development and hasn't been given a thorough
going-over by many developers. It could turn out to be an obvious
improvement that is accepted quickly, or it could fall victim to the
fact that process migration tends to be a deep, dark art with many
incantations and strange requirements. Time will tell. But, it seems
like Rakib's got a fun piece of code that inevitably will gain some
interest among CPU people.
</p><p>
Periodically, someone expresses frustration at how difficult it is to
test scheduler improvements. This time it was <span   class="bold"><b>Pantelis
Antoniou</b></span>, who has
been working on <span   class="bold"><b>big.LITTLE</b></span> architectures. The idea behind big.LITTLE
is to have a device with two CPUs: one smaller and weaker that
handles ordinary operations, and the other bigger and more powerful
that gets processes requiring more kick. Any process on the smaller
CPU that starts to get too active will be migrated over to the bigger
CPU in a seamless fashion. Devices like this have been coming out
lately because they tend to have longer battery life than traditional
systems, but they're radically different from the SMP-oriented
scheduling that Linux grew up with.
</p><p>
Pantelis has suggested implementing some kind of user session
recording and playback, so that a large corpus of typical user
activity could be built up and then used to test improvements to
Linux's scheduler code. As it turns out, some rudimentary
session recording tools already exist, but they'd need a lot of
work in order to be useful for scheduler testing. And, one
potentially big obstacle is the fact that any type of recording 
undoubtedly would slow down the user interface, changing user behavior and
tainting the sample.
</p><p>
But, it still seems like a cool idea. Scheduler advancement is a
nightmare of uncertainty in which debates often take the form of the
following: &ldquo;We
should do this!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why???&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I say so!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I say something
else!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;, and so on.

I remember the first time I tried to install <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> on Linux. I was so
excited to have a native &ldquo;real&rdquo; game to play, that I couldn't grab my
installation CD fast enough. Unfortunately, I didn't really take good
care of my media, and the CD was too scratched to read.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11279desuraf1.large.jpg"><img src="11279desuraf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

I suspect something similar happened to the inventor of
Steam for
Windows. Having a permanent on-line archive of your video game library
is awesome. Unfortunately, Linux users not only don't have Steam, but it
seems like every game we do have installs in its own unique way. Some
have binary installers; some are in the package management system;
some must be compiled.
</p><p>
Thanks to the fine folks at Desura, Linux users finally get to play
with the cool kids! Although obviously a clone of the Steam idea, Desura
does an incredible job of simplifying management and installation. It
has a built-in game store offering free and for-pay games, and it even
supports &ldquo;codes&rdquo; for activating games purchased elsewhere. (My favorite
&ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; is the awesome Humble Bundle site that periodically sells
Linux-compatible games.)
</p><p>
If you're a gamer and a Linux user, you owe it to yourself
to give Desura a try. You can download it at <a href="http://www.desura.com" target="_self">www.desura.com</a>. And if you
like Linux-compatible games, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_self">www.humblebundle.com</a>

Usually it's Linux folks who are left out in the cold with regard to
cool software. In the case of Pandora Radio, however, it's tough to beat
the Linux native Pithos application. Thankfully, Windows users have an
open-source option for native Pandora Radio playback as well. Elpis is
a .NET Pandora application available for Microsoft Windows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11279fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
We still think Pithos looks nicer and has a smoother interface, but
if you're stuck on Windows, Elpis is fully open source and under active
development. A screenshot is worth a thousand words, but if you want to

<h2 class="title">Open Source for the Space Age</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #218, June 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
NASA has started a rather ambitious project: to provide open-source
everything. The main site is located at <a href="http://open.nasa.gov" target="_self">open.nasa.gov</a>. From here,
there is access to data, code and applications, among other things. This
is a great launching point for anyone interested in space science and
NASA work. In this article, I look at what kind of code is being made
available that you might want to explore.
</p><p>
The available software covers several genres.
Some are low-level, systems-layer software. You can go ahead and do some
really long-distance transfers with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION). This
is an implementation of the Delay-Tolerant Networking architecture
(DTN) as described in RFC 4838. This software is physically hosted
at SourceForge, and you can use this code to communicate with
your next interplanetary probe.
</p><p>
A bit more down to earth is a middleware package that actually
is hosted by the Apache Foundation. You can download and use the
Object-Oriented Data Technology (OODT) middleware. OODT is component-based,
so you can pick and choose which parts you want to use. There are
components to handle transparent access to distributed resources, data
discovery and query optimization, and distributed processing. There are
also components to handle work-flow and resource management. Groups that
are using it include the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and NASA's
Planetary Data System. If you're managing data systems, this might be
worth taking a look at.
</p><p>
Getting back to actual science processing, you might want to download the Data
Productivity Toolkit (DPT). This package is a collection of command-line
tools, written in Python, that lets you work on text data files. These
utilities follow the UNIX design method of having small utilities that
do one task well, and then chaining them together to do more complicated
processing. There are tools for massaging and manipulating your data,
tools for doing statistics on that data and even tools for visualizing
the data and the results. Many of the tools even provide an API to basic
Python and numpy/scipy/matplotlib routines. 
</p><p>
And, while I'm talking about Python
and science, you also can look at SunPy. SunPy aims to provide a library of
routines that are useful in studying solar physics. With it, you can
query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) and grab data that you can
process. Many routines are available that allow you to plot this data using
various color maps and processing filters. There is a Sun object that
contains physical constants useful in solar physics, along with the
sun's position and numerous other solar attributes.
</p><p>
A lot of the computational work done at NASA involves clusters
of machines and massively parallel code. This means the NASA folks have needed to
put together lots of tools to manage these machines. They also have been
nice enough to release a lot of this code for public consumption. The
first of these is multil (Multi-Threaded Multi-Node Utilities). In
the standard GNU file tools, cp and md5sum operate as a single-threaded
process on a single machine. The multil tools provide drop-in replacements
called mcp and msum. These utilities use multithreading to make sure
each node is kept as busy as possible. Read and write parallelism allows
for individual operations of a single copy to be interleaved through
asynchronous I/O. Split file processing allows for different threads
to operate on different portions of a file in parallel. 
</p><p>
NASA also
provides a utility to give SSH access to your cluster. There is a
middleware utility called mesh (Middleware Using Existing SSH Hosts)
that provides single sign-on capability. Mesh sits on top of SSH,
and instead of using the local authorized_keys file, loads a file for a
dedicated server at runtime. Mesh also has its own shell (called mash)
that restricts what applications are available to the user. Using this
system, you can add and remove SSH hosts that are available
to be used dynamically. Also, because the authentication is handled by a library that
is preloaded when SSH first starts up, the restrictions are sure to
be enforced on the user. 
</p><p>
Now that you have a connection mechanism, you
may need to handle load balancing across all of these machines. Again,
NASA comes to your aid. It has a software package called ballast
(Balancing Load Across Systems) that might help. This package handles
load balancing for SSH connections specifically. Each available host runs a
ballast client, and there are one or more ballast servers. The servers
maintain system load information gathered from the clients and use it to
make decisions about where to send SSH connection requests. Because all
of this is handled over SSH, the policy deciding which host to connect to
also can take into account the user name. This way, you can have policies
that are specific to each user. This lets you better tune the best options
for each user, rather than trying to find a common policy that everyone
is forced to use.
</p><p>
Going back to doing science, another important task is visualization, and NASA
has released several tools to help. The first one I look at here 
is World Wind. This is an Earth visualization system. You can use it to
get a 3-D look at Earth and to see data projected onto
the globe. It is a Java application, so it works on any desktop that
has a Java virtual machine, as well as in most browsers. It is a full
development kit, and it has several example applications that you can use as
jumping-off points for your own code. 
</p><p>
Taking visualization further from
the surface of the Earth, there is ViSBARD (Visual System for Browsing,
Analysis and Retrieval of Data). This application allows you to pull data
from multiple satellites and display them concurrently. It also allows
for 3-D viewing of all of this data. This type of vector
field information is very difficult to analyze in 2-D plots,
hence the need for this kind of tool. The latest version also allows you
to visualize MHD (Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic) models. This way, you can compare
results from model calculations to actual satellite measurements. 
</p><p>
More
extensive image processing can be done with the Vision Workbench. This
is an application and a full library of imaging and computer vision
algorithms. It isn't meant to be a complete, cutting-edge library though. Rather,
it provides solid implementations of standard algorithms you can
use as starting points in developing your own algorithms.
</p><p>
When you're ready to go and launch your own satellite, you can download
and use the Core Flight Executive (cFE). This software is used as the
basis for flight data systems and instrumentation. It is written in C and
based on OSAL (Operating System Abstraction Layer). It has an executive,
along with time and event services. You can track your satellite with
the ODTBX (Orbit Determination Toolbox). The ODTBX package handles orbit
determination analysis and early mission analysis. It's available as
both MATLAB code and Java.
</p><p>
The last piece of code I cover here is S4PM (Simple, Scalable,
Script-based Science Processor for Measurements). This actually is used
at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center
to do data processing. It is built up out of a processing engine,
a toolkit and a graphical monitor. S4PM allows a
single person to manage hundreds of jobs simultaneously. It also
is designed to be relatively easy to set up new processing strings.
</p><p>
The open-source project at NASA doesn't cover only code. NASA has
been releasing data as well. The Kepler Project is looking for
exo-planets. As I mentioned previously, you can download data from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory. You can work on climate data by checking out
information from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. You can look up
tons of data from the various moon missions, from Apollo on up. There also is
data from the various planetary missions. Climate data and measurements
of Earth are available too.
</p><p>
I've touched on only a few of the items NASA
has provided for the public. Hopefully, you have seen enough to go and
check out the rest in more detail. There is a lot of science that regular
citizens can do, and NASA is doing its part to try to put the tools
into your hands.

<h2 class="title">Plex Media Server + Roku = Awesome</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #218, June 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Plex always has been the Mac-friendly offshoot of XBMC. I've never
considered using an Apple product for my home media center, so I've
never really put much thought into it. Things have changed recently,
however, and now the folks behind Plex have given the Linux community
an awesome media server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11279plexf1.large.jpg"><img src="11279plexf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Installing the media server is fairly straightforward. Instructions are
available at <a href="http://www.plexapp.com" target="_self">www.plexapp.com</a>. The server application runs on a headless Linux
server and is configured via a Web interface. After you've pointed Plex
Media Server at your video collection, the real magic begins.
</p><p>
Fire up your Roku, any model, and search for the Plex channel in the
Roku Channel Store. With some simple configuration, your Roku will be
able to browse your entire media collection and stream HD video to your
television. The responsiveness is incredible, and the video quality is
astounding. I was expecting pixelated video with stuttering playback
over wireless, but everything was smooth. Your local media behaves
just like Netflix! For more information, check out the Plex Web site:

<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #218, June 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the great things about independent game companies is that they realize
Linux gamers exist&mdash;and we're willing to spend money. Frozenbyte is
the indie game developer that brought us
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Shadowgrounds</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shadowgrounds
Survivor</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine</em></span>. Frozenbyte was kind enough to send me a review copy of
its newest release, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11279trinef1.large.jpg"><img src="11279trinef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
As an obvious sequel to the original, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span> is a
platform-based
side-scroller. It has stunning graphics, rich sounds and a pleasant
storyline. The game revolves around solving physics puzzles in a
fantasy-based world. It's no secret I'm a rather poor gamer, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span> is
enjoyable even for a part-time player like myself. It also supports
multiplayer co-op mode for up to three players. Multiplayer mode works
both on the local network and over the Internet.
</p><p>
I'll admit, it took a little while to get used to jumping with the W key
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span> uses the WASD keys for movement), but that wasn't a big deal. I
was able to jump right in and start playing. I truly appreciated the
ability to skip past cut scenes and get right to the action. If you're in
the mood for a fun game with great graphics, I highly recommend
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span>.
</p><p>
The Collector's Edition comes with a digital artbook and soundtrack. You
can buy it through the Humble Store now at <a href="http://www.trine2.com" target="_self">www.trine2.com</a> or from the
developer's Web site, <a href="http://www.frozenbyte.com" target="_self">www.frozenbyte.com</a>.
