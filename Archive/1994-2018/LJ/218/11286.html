Polywell's i2303 packs a ton of awesome into a teeny-weeny little box.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x26882a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's a lot to love about the nettop concept. The small form factor,
the quiet operation, the power efficiency&mdash;they all make a nettop
seem like the perfect casual workstation. Unfortunately, along with all
those good features comes the unwelcome reality of slow performance and
underwhelming responsiveness. I recently had the opportunity to review the Polywell
i2303, which takes two concepts and mashes them together to form a
product much better than the sum of its parts. Much like the combination
of peanut butter and chocolate, this workstation from Polywell is better
than a nettop and better than a powerhouse workstation. It's both.
</p><p>
The i2303 is marketed for use in digital signage, HTPC and as a Linux
workstation. For this review, I focused on the latter. Because the market is
full of great HTPC units, I wanted to see if this nondescript box could
really cut the mustard as a workstation. The answer is an overwhelming
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2688568"></a>
Construction</h2></div></div><p>
The body of the i2303 is about the size of a standard nettop device, or
maybe just a bit bigger. The chassis is 1.55" wide, 6.6" deep and 9.1"
tall. The included stand makes it a bit bigger, but that's the point of
the stand&mdash;to help it stand up. The entire unit, including the stand,
is metal. It's quite solid and feels strong enough to use as a jack
stand for your car. (I'm sure that would void any warranty, so I don't
suggest testing my theory.)
</p><p>
The design is simplicity at its best. The front sports a power button,
activity LEDs, microphone and headphone jacks, a USB 3.0 port and an SD
card slot (Figure 1). Both sides are vented, but the metal chassis
is thick enough that the vents don't weaken the structure at all.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11286f1.large.jpg"><img src="11286f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Silver or black&mdash;no more, no less (photo from <a href="http://polywell.com" target="_self">polywell.com</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
Flipping the unit over reveals a generous assortment of ports
(Figure 2): a rear analog speaker jack, an external 802.11n antenna
(removable with standard connector for larger antenna), an optical audio
port, HDMI, four USB 2.0 ports, an eSATA port, Gigabit Ethernet, DVI
and power connector. The power is a 19V DC connector, which is common
in computers this size. The silence of this noiseless design is a fair
trade for the inconvenience of an external transformer. The included
power cord is very long with the transformer in the middle of its length,
so it doesn't take up more than a single plug like wall warts often do.

</p></div></div><p>
Notable on this unit is a lack of a standard VGA port. Although a DVI-VGA
converter dongle certainly will accommodate a VGA monitor, it does hint to
the unit's higher-end internals. The massive copper heatsink is visible
from the back as well. That too hints to the unit being more than meets
the eye, but from an aesthetic standpoint, I think the copper looks cool
showing through.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2688b40"></a>
The Guts</h2></div></div><p>
A peek inside (Figure 3) shows pretty much what you'd expect. The design
is more akin to a high-end laptop than a desktop, but with the nettop
form factor, that makes sense. Most notable is the large heatsink,
efficiently designed to get heat away from the CPU and GPU with the aid
of a blower fan. I've been hinting this whole time about the unit's specs,
but here is a list of the specifications this review unit boasts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Intel Core i5-2467M mobile processor.
</p></li><li><p>
NVIDIA GeForce 520 graphics card with 1GB graphics memory.
</p></li><li><p>
DVI dual-link graphics port supports 2560x1600 high-resolution display.
</p></li><li><p>
HDMI output supports dual-display configuration.
</p></li><li><p>
8GB DDR3 memory.
</p></li><li><p>
20GB SLC mSATA SSD (super speed) for OS and swap files.
</p></li><li><p>
500G 2.5" SATA 7200RPM hard drive for data storage.
</p></li><li><p>
Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11n Wi-Fi + Bluetooth.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
DC19V low-voltage power adapter.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11286f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The compact design necessitates the well-placed heatsink (photo
from <a href="http://polywell.com" target="_self">polywell.com</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
Reading the specifications is more like reading the specs for a high-end desktop machine than a compact unit like this. Since I opened the
box before looking at the packing slip (my wife says this is a typical
guy move), I did a double-take when first looking at the hardware list.
</p><p>
The CPU is a mobile chip, but it's an i5 Sandy Bridge processor. Because
the i2303 looks like a unit that should be sporting an Atom processor,
the i5 option is impressive. Although the larger CPU is certainly part of
the reason this unit has a cooling fan, even under heavy load, the unit
is very quiet.
</p><p>
Graphics with computers of this size are always an interesting
topic. Although most nettop units support acceleration for 1080p video
playback, they usually fall short for other GPU-intensive tasks. I'm
only a casual gamer, but with the i2303's NVIDIA GeForce 520 chip, I
was able to play 3-D shooters at a fairly high resolution without notable
frustration. Although this certainly isn't a gaming rig, the GPU was capable
enough for more than just <span   class="emphasis"><em>Solitaire</em></span>. In fact, this is the unit I used for
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Trine 2</em></span> review in the UpFront section of this
issue, and it played quite nicely.
</p><p>
I didn't test the memory speed, since for the most part memory is as
memory does, but the <span   class="emphasis"><em>amount</em></span> of memory included is
impressive. Again,
the tiny plain-Jane case is misleading, and 8GB of DDR3 memory was a
welcome surprise. This boon of memory may be part of the reason large
games worked so well, as the computer had plenty of room for memory-intensive applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x26897f8"></a>
The Hybrid Beast Within</h2></div></div><p>
With all the impressive features the i2303 boasts, my absolute favorite
feature is the hard drive system. In Figure 3, you can see there
is a standard 500GB SATA drive, which although speedy itself at 7200RPM,
is there only for bulk storage. The system has an integrated 20GB SLC-based SSD designed for storing the OS and swap files. (See the sidebar
for an explanation on SLC vs. MLC.) Because the OS is hosted on a blazing-fast SSD, it means the boot time is measured in seconds. It also means
applications launch lightning-fast, but more on that later.
</p><p>
I've heard mixed reviews from folks using the new all-in-one hybrid
hard drives that have both SSD and HDD components to increase speed. The
concept is brilliant, but because Linux so easily uses multiple devices for
different partitions, Polywell's multidrive setup works perfectly. For
my test, I put everything but /home on the SSD, and with a few tweaks,
it worked well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x26899b0"></a>
Getting Down and Dirty</h2></div></div><p>
Once the computer boots up, which with my Xubuntu 12.04 system takes
less than 15 seconds, it feels like a computer running from RAM. The
menus are snappy, the applications start up immediately, and Internet
connectivity, whether via LAN or wireless, works flawlessly.
</p><p>
As far as functionality goes, the computer behaves much like you'd expect
once you know its specifications. All hardware was detected properly;
everything seems to function correctly, and there were no odd configuration
steps required to get full functionality. Although this is largely credited
to Linux developers, it's fair to point out the i2303 uses standard-enough hardware that it works with Linux out of the box. It also ships
with Linux out of the box, which always is appreciated by folks not
wishing to pay for a Microsoft Windows license they'll never use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2689b10"></a>
Getting Tweaky with It</h2></div></div><p>
It seems every time I have distinct partitions set up on a computer,
months later, I find that I estimated my needs incorrectly. I knew I
wanted to install the operating system and swap files on the 20GB SSD,
but I did have concerns about running out of space.
</p><p>
I spent a lot of time thinking about how best to partition the two
drives, but in the end, I put the root partition on the SSD and the /home
partition on the 500GB SATA hard drive. As you can imagine, my concern was
that the /var directory would fill the limited space quickly. I strongly
considered putting only the /boot and /usr partitions on the SSD, but
I really wanted to see just how fast the computer could be.
</p><p>
Because I installed a handful of games, several of which were quite large,
one of the first things I had to do was make a symbolic link to the /opt
directory and place it on the hard drive. If I start to have problems
with the /var directory, I'll likely do the same. I decided that because Linux
is so flexible with symbolic links, I'd be better off putting everything
but /home on the SSD and carve off problem areas later. I love Linux.
</p><p>
As the bulk of my games are on the /opt partition, they do load from
the hard drive instead of the SSD. It means a couple more seconds to
adjust my headphones while I wait for games to load, but it doesn't
affect the load time of other applications, nor does it slow down boot
time. That said, the 7200RPM SATA drive is no slouch, so even from the
hard drive, things load acceptably fast.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2a81f70"></a>
The Good</h2></div></div><p>
There's a lot to love about the Polywell i2303. Although it certainly
would make a wonderful computer for digital signage or HTPC, I think both tasks
would be a waste of the unit's abilities. If I had to pick my favorite
things, I guess they'd be these:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dual SSD/HDD combination.
</p></li><li><p>
Above-average graphic performance for such a compact unit.
</p></li><li><p>
Rock-solid construction.
</p></li><li><p>
Impressive feature list.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The last item on my list is easy to overlook. This little unit has a few
features that surprised me. The USB 3.0 port, the dual analog speaker
jacks, Bluetooth and detachable antenna are just a few.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2a823e8"></a>
The Bad</h2></div></div><p>
There were a few minor quirks to the unit. The antenna, while removable,
does jut out a bit in the back. I worry if placed in a busy environment
it might get broken off. I also noticed whenever I loaded a Web page
with Flash on it, the system fan kicked on full blast for a moment. I
suspect that is as much the fault of NVIDIA and Adobe as anyone, but it
still caught my attention on a regular basis.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2a824f0"></a>
The Ugly</h2></div></div><p>
Some might be turned off by the absolute stark design of the case. This
computer is a sturdy metal box and has no frills. I personally think
that is a plus, but if you want glowing LED lighting and an aerodynamic
design, this computer isn't for you.
</p><p>
At first glance, the $799 price tag seems steep, but once you realize
how much computer you're getting, I think it's quite reasonable. If
you're just hoping to get a cheap nettop computer, this probably isn't
the unit for you. If you're looking for an energy-efficient workstation-class device, $799 isn't a bad price.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2a826a8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I won't lie; I love this little computer. If I could use an automotive
metaphor, it's a total sleeper. What seems like a piddly little nettop is
actually a very functional workstation. I'm a writer, a casual gamer and
I occasionally compile software. Even though my demands aren't terribly
high, I still prefer a computer that is fast and responsive. This
computer ticked every box for me. For more information, check out

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2590580.0x2a82808"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
SLC vs. MLC</b></p><p>
SSD drives are becoming quite standard, but few people understand or
care about SLC technology vs. MLC. The science behind the two
could be an article in itself, but the quick-and-dirty explanation is that
SLC can hold a single bit per cell, and MLC can hold two.
</p><p>
The advantage for SLC SSDs is that because each cell holds only a single
bit, it is fast and less error-prone. The downside is that the storage
density is half that of MLC, so the cost per bit is double. With MLC
drives, the advantage is, of course, the storage capacity, but because they
require a more complex error-correction mechanism, they tend to be a
bit slower.
</p><p>
Keep in mind these are generalizations. Please don't send in letters
about brand XYZ's MLC SSD being 50 times faster than brand ABC's SLC
SSD. The point is to realize that an SLC SSD was the right choice for the
i2303's hybrid design.
