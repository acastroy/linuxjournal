An overview of the promising VMware Server 2.0 Beta.

VMware Server 2.0 Beta is the next evolution in the free-as-in-beer
virtualization line. It's able to run on both Linux and Windows and
virtualize a wide range of guest operating systems. We tested out the
beta on Ubuntu 7.10, running on an Intel Core 2 Duo 6600 at 2.4GHz with
2GB DDR2 memory.
</p><p>
The new features available in the beta include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Web-based management interface.
</p></li><li><p>
New supported operating systems, including Vista Business and Ultimate
(host only), Windows Server 2008, RHEL 5 and Ubuntu 7.10.
</p></li><li><p>
Up to 8GB of memory per VM (up from 3.6GB).
</p></li><li><p>
Up to two virtual SMP processors.
</p></li><li><p>
Up to 64 VMs per host.
</p></li><li><p>
VIX API 1.2&mdash;scripting API for automation.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for VMI, enabling transparent paravirtualization for supported
guests.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The installation routine hasn't changed from that on almost every VMware
product on Linux for the last five years. The console-based wizard is
relatively easy to follow. So far, the beta doesn't have any real user
authentication methods; it expects the root user name and password to
log in to its Web interface. Ubuntu users need to enable the root
account by setting a root password to use VMware Server.
</p><p>
The traditional-looking VMware console has been done away with entirely,
and the FAQ and release notes seem to imply that a standalone VMware
console cannot be used to access the virtual machines, although we were
unable to confirm this. Instead, the Web interface is intended to be
the entire interaction point between the user and the VMware processes.
</p><p>
The Web interface looks extremely professional and appears as
though it has been designed specifically for Server, as it bears little
resemblance to that found in VMware's flagship virtualization platform,
ESX Server. The interface feels a little clunky to use and is slow to
respond. Occasionally, buttons simply would refuse to react until the
Web browser had been refreshed. The console to access virtual
machines directly has been implemented as a browser plugin that the sever prompts
you to install when you first attempt to navigate to the Console
tab. The plugin seems to work only for Firefox running on Windows or
Linux; Internet Explorer or Mac OS X users seem to be clear out of luck.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9962f1.large.jpg"><img src="9962f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The plugin seems extremely buggy, often requiring a refresh of
the browser window before it will work again. The console also often
crashes the browser&mdash;quite a major irritation. However, when the plugin
is working, it works exceptionally well with surprising
performance&mdash;an impressive feat. If the stability issues can be straightened out,
it's an exceptionally powerful tool. On the server side, the version of
Tomcat bundled with VMware Server occasionally would malfunction until
the process was restarted, sending TCP RST to the browser.
</p><p>
When it's up, the interface to define or add virtual machines is 
cumbersome. First, a data store has to be defined, and the dialog to open
VMs, CD images and any other file type does not support browsing outside
that data store. Given that anyone logging in to VMware Server runs as
root, we imagine there might be some security implications of allowing
VMware access to the entire filesystem, but because VMware Server
runs as root, there definitely are some security implications, as it
can do whatever the heck it likes anyway. Hopefully, this design choice
makes more sense when user authentication is implemented into the
product later on&mdash;particularly if data stores can be defined only by a
root user and can't be modified later by an unprivileged user.

</p></div></div><p>
Every attempt to add any of our three already-configured Microsoft Windows
virtual machines immediately crashed the browser. Unfortunately, for
this reason, we were unable to test running Microsoft Windows under VMware
Server 2.0 Beta, not having any free licenses to create another Windows
VM. We were able to add pre-existing Debian virtual machines that had
been created in Workstation 6 for Linux.
</p><p>
Server 2.0 Beta allows for the creation of two Virtual machine types:
Server 2 and legacy. Server 2 VMs are Workstation 6-compatible
and support ten virtual Ethernet devices instead of only three, as well
as paravirtualization with a supported guest OS. Unfortunately, the
compatibility of the new Server 2 VM format seems rather buggy. Using
the Server 2 option seems to guarantee a VM that does not work on
Workstation 6, VMware Player 2 or VMware Fusion 1.1, all of which should
be able to open them.
</p><p>
We decided to install an OpenSUSE 10.3 virtual machine to test the
performance of the console interface with a heavy graphical desktop
environment. The performance was exceptional in every area&mdash;feeling almost
as though we were sitting in front of a reasonably spec'd machine running
the OS natively. The in-browser console rendered the desktop beautifully
without a single glitch. The mouse performance was slightly subpar, but
this is an issue we have found on almost every virtualization platform
we've tried. It looks very much like VMware Server has caught up with
Player, Workstation and Fusion in leveraging the extra hardware features
of the newer Intel and AMD architectures that accelerate virtualization.

One aspect of the new beta that is above reproach is the
documentation. The user manual is exceptional for a product in this
stage of development, covering all conceivable aspects of using VMware
Server. All other available documentation is polished and
looks very complete already.
</p><p>
VMware Server 2 looks like a very promising product. Unfortunately,
it has massive showstopper bugs that make this seem more like a
pre-alpha than a beta. The feature set, however, is relatively solid
and particularly impressive given the price tag. If these issues can be
worked through, the Web interface is a powerful enough tool that this
could be a promising iteration in the VMware Server line.
