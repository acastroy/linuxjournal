Set up a PXE server and then add menus to boot kickstart images,
rescue disks and diagnostic tools all from the network.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's funny how automation evolves as system administrators manage larger numbers of
servers. When you manage only a few servers, it's fine to pop in an install
CD and set options manually. As the number of servers grows, you might
realize it makes sense to set up a kickstart or FAI (Debian's Fully
Automated Installer) environment to automate all that manual
configuration at install time. Now, you boot the install CD, type in a few
boot arguments to point the machine to the kickstart server, and go get a
cup of coffee as the machine installs.
</p><p>
When the day comes that you have to install three or four machines at once,
you either can burn extra CDs or investigate PXE boot. The Preboot
eXecution Environment is an open standard developed by Intel to allow
machines to boot over a network instead of from local media, such as a floppy,
CD or hard drive. Modern servers and newer laptops and desktops with
integrated NICs should support PXE booting in the BIOS&mdash;in some cases, it's
enabled by default, and in other cases, you need to go into your BIOS settings to
enable it.
</p><p>
Because many modern servers these days offer built-in remote power and remote
terminals or otherwise are remotely accessible via serial console servers
or networked KVM, if you have a PXE boot environment set up, you can
power on remotely, then boot and install a machine from miles away.
</p><p>
If you have never set up a PXE boot server before, the first part of this
article covers the steps to get your first PXE server up and running.
If PXE booting is old hat to you, skip ahead to the section
called PXE Menu Magic. There, I cover how to configure boot menus when
you PXE boot, so instead of hunting down MAC addresses and doing a lot of
setup before an install, you simply can boot, select your OS, and you are off
and running. After that, I discuss how to integrate rescue tools, such as 
Knoppix and memtest86+, into your PXE environment, so they are available to
any machine that can boot from the network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d9608"></a>
PXE Setup</h2></div></div><p>
You need three main pieces of infrastructure for a PXE setup: a
DHCP server, a TFTP server and the syslinux software. Both DHCP and TFTP
can reside on the same server. When a system attempts to boot from the
network, the DHCP server gives it an IP address and then tells it the
address for the TFTP server and the name of the bootstrap program to run.
The TFTP server then serves that file, which in our case is a PXE-enabled
syslinux binary. That program runs on the booted machine and then can load
Linux kernels or other OS files that also are shared on the TFTP server
over the network. Once the kernel is loaded, the OS starts as normal,
and if you have configured a kickstart install correctly, the install
begins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d9768"></a>
Configure DHCP</h2></div></div><p>
Any relatively new DHCP server will support PXE booting, so if you don't
already have a DHCP server set up, just use your distribution's DHCP server
package (possibly named dhcpd, dhcp3-server or something similar).
Configuring DHCP to suit your network is somewhat beyond the scope of this
article, but many distributions ship a default configuration file that
should provide a good place to start. Once the DHCP server is installed,
edit the configuration file (often in /etc/dhcpd.conf), and locate the
subnet section (or each host section if you configured static IP assignment
via DHCP and want these hosts to PXE boot), and add two lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
next-server ip_of_pxe_server;
filename "pxelinux.0";
</pre>
</p><p>
The next-server directive tells the host the IP address of the TFTP server,
and the filename directive tells it which file to download and execute from
that server. Change the next-server argument to match the IP address of
your TFTP server, and keep filename set to pxelinux.0, as that is the name
of the syslinux PXE-enabled executable. 
</p><p>
In the subnet section, you also need to add dynamic-bootp to the range
directive. Here is an example subnet section after the changes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range dynamic-bootp 10.0.0.200 10.0.0.220;
    next-server 10.0.0.1;
    filename "pxelinux.0";
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d99d0"></a>
Install TFTP</h2></div></div><p>
After the DHCP server is configured and running, you are ready to install
TFTP. The pxelinux executable requires a TFTP server that supports the
tsize option, and two good choices are either tftpd-hpa or atftp. In many
distributions, these options already are packaged under these names, so just install
your distribution's package or otherwise follow the installation
instructions from the project's official site. 
</p><p>
Depending on your TFTP package, you might need to add an entry to
/etc/inetd.conf if it wasn't already added for you:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tftp           dgram   udp     wait    root  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see in this example, the -s option (used for tftpd-hpa) specified
/var/lib/tftpboot as the directory to contain my files, but on some
systems,
these files are commonly stored in /tftpboot, so see your /etc/inetd.conf
file and your tftpd man page and check on its conventions if you are
unsure. If your distribution uses xinetd and doesn't create a file in
/etc/xinetd.d for you, create a file called /etc/xinetd.d/tftp that
contains the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# default: off
# description: The tftp server serves files using 
# the trivial file transfer protocol. 
# The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless 
# workstations, download configuration files to network-aware
# printers, and to start the installation process for
# some operating systems.
service tftp
{
        disable = no
        socket_type             = dgram
        protocol                = udp
        wait                    = yes
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
        server_args             = -s /var/lib/tftpboot
        per_source              = 11
        cps                     = 100 2
        flags                   = IPv4
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As tftpd is part of inetd or xinetd, you will not need to start any service.
At most, you might need to reload inetd or xinetd; however, make sure that
any software firewall you have running allows the TFTP port (port 69 udp)
as input.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d9ce8"></a>
Add Syslinux</h2></div></div><p>
Now that TFTP is set up, all that is left to do is to install the syslinux
package (available for most distributions, or you can follow the
installation instructions from the project's main Web page), copy the
supplied pxelinux.0 file to /var/lib/tftpboot (or your TFTP directory), and
then create a /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg directory to hold pxelinux
configuration files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24d9df0"></a>
PXE Menu Magic</h2></div></div><p>
You can configure pxelinux with or without menus, and many administrators
use pxelinux without them. There are compelling reasons to use
pxelinux menus, which I discuss below, but first, here's
how some pxelinux setups are configured.
</p><p>
When many people configure pxelinux, they create configuration files for a
machine or class of machines based on the fact that when pxelinux loads it
searches the pxelinux.cfg directory on the TFTP server for configuration
files in the following order:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Files named 01-MACADDRESS with hyphens in between each hex pair. So, for a
server with a MAC address of 88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD, a configuration file that
would target only that machine would be named 01-88-99-aa-bb-cc-dd (and
I've noticed it does matter that it is lowercase).
</p></li><li><p>
Files named after the host's IP address in hex. Here, pxelinux will drop a
digit from the end of the hex IP and try again as each file search fails.
This is often used when an administrator buys a lot of the same brand of
machine, which often will have very similar MAC addresses. The
administrator then can configure DHCP to assign a certain IP range to
those MAC addresses. Then, a boot option can be applied to all of that
group. 
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, if no specific files can be found, pxelinux will look for a file
named default and use it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One nice feature of pxelinux is that it uses the same syntax as syslinux, so
porting over a configuration from a CD, for instance, can start with the
syslinux options and follow with your custom network options. Here is an
example configuration for an old CentOS 3.6 kickstart:

<pre     class="programlisting">
default linux
label linux
    kernel vmlinuz-centos-3.6
    append text nofb load_ramdisk=1 initrd=initrd-centos-3.6.img 
    &#8618;network ks=http://10.0.0.1/kickstart/centos3.cfg
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24da268"></a>
Why Use Menus?</h2></div></div><p>
The standard sort of pxelinux setup works fine, and many administrators use
it, but one of the annoying aspects of it is that even if you know you
want to install, say, CentOS 3.6 on a server, you first have to get the MAC
address. So, you either go to the machine and find a sticker that lists the
MAC address, boot the machine into the BIOS to read the MAC, or let it get
a lease on the network. Then, you need to create either a custom
configuration file for that host's MAC or make sure its MAC is part of a
group you already have configured. Depending on your infrastructure, this
step can add substantial time to each server. Even if you buy servers in
batches and group in IP ranges, what happens if you want to install a
different OS on one of the servers? You then have to go through the
additional work of tracking down the MAC to set up an exclusion.
</p><p>
With pxelinux menus, I can preconfigure any of the different network boot
scenarios I need and assign a number to them. Then, when a machine boots, I
get an ASCII menu I can customize that lists all of these options and their
number. Then, I can select the option I want, press Enter, and the install is
off and running. Beyond that, now I have the option of adding
non-kickstart images and can make them available to all of my servers, not
just certain groups. With this feature, you can make rescue tools like
Knoppix and memtest86+ available to any machine on the network that can PXE
boot. You even can set a timeout, like with boot CDs, that will select a
default option. I use this to select my standard Knoppix rescue mode after
30 seconds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24da420"></a>
Configure PXE Menus</h2></div></div><p>
Because pxelinux shares the syntax of syslinux, if you have any CDs that have
fancy syslinux menus, you can refer to them for examples. Because you want to
make this available to all hosts, move any more specific configuration
files out of pxelinux.cfg, and create a file named default. When the
pxelinux program fails to find any more specific files, it then will load
this configuration. Here is a sample menu configuration with two options:
the first boots Knoppix over the network, and the second boots a CentOS 4.5
kickstart:

<pre     class="programlisting">
default 1
timeout 300
prompt 1
display f1.msg
F1 f1.msg
F2 f2.msg

label 1
    kernel vmlinuz-knx5.1.1
    append secure nfsdir=10.0.0.1:/mnt/knoppix/5.1.1 
    &#8618;nodhcp lang=us ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init 
    &#8618;2 apm=power-off nomce vga=normal
    &#8618;initrd=miniroot-knx5.1.1.gz quiet BOOT_IMAGE=knoppix
label 2
    kernel vmlinuz-centos-4.5-64
    append text nofb ksdevice=eth0 load_ramdisk=1
    &#8618;initrd=initrd-centos-4.5-64.img network
    &#8618;ks=http://10.0.0.1/kickstart/centos4-64.cfg 
</pre>
</p><p>
Each of these options is documented in the syslinux man page, but I 
highlight a few here. The default option sets which label to boot when the
timeout expires. The timeout is in tenths of a second, so in this example,
the timeout is 30 seconds, after which it will boot using the options
set under label 1. The display option lists a message if there are any to display by
default, so if you want to display a fancy menu for these two options, you
could create a file called f1.msg in /var/lib/tftpboot/ that contains
something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

----| Boot Options |-----
|                       |
| 1. Knoppix 5.1.1      |
| 2. CentOS 4.5 64 bit  |
|                       |
-------------------------

&lt;F1&gt; Main | &lt;F2&gt; Help
Default image will boot in 30 seconds...

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I listed F1 and F2 in the menu. You can create multiple files
that will be output to the screen when the user presses the function keys.
This can be useful if you have more menu options than can fit on a single
screen, or if you want to provide extra documentation at boot time (this is
handy if you are like me and create custom boot arguments for your
kickstart servers). In this example, I could create a
/var/lib/tftpboot/f2.msg file and add a short help file.
</p><p>
Although this menu is rather basic, check out the syslinux configuration file
and project page for examples of how to jazz it up with color and even
custom graphics.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24da6e0"></a>
Extra Features: PXE Rescue Disk</h2></div></div><p>
One of my favorite features of a PXE server is the addition of a Knoppix
rescue disk. Now, whenever I need to recover a machine, I don't need to hunt
around for a disk, I can just boot the server off the network. 
</p><p>
First, get a Knoppix disk. I use a Knoppix 5.1.1 CD for this example, 
but I've been successful with much older Knoppix CDs. Mount the CD-ROM, and
then go to the boot/isolinux directory on the CD. Copy the miniroot.gz and
vmlinuz files to your /var/lib/tftpboot directory, except rename them
something distinct, such as miniroot-knx5.1.1.gz and vmlinuz-knx5.1.1,
respectively. Now, edit your pxelinux.cfg/default file, and add lines like
the one I used above in my example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
label 1
    kernel vmlinuz-knx5.1.1
    append secure nfsdir=10.0.0.1:/mnt/knoppix/5.1.1 nodhcp 
    &#8618;lang=us ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init 2 
    &#8618;apm=power-off nomce vga=normal
    &#8618;initrd=miniroot-knx5.1.1.gz quiet BOOT_IMAGE=knoppix
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice here that I labeled it 1, so if you already have a label with that
name, you need to decide which of the two to rename. Also notice that
this example references the renamed vmlinuz-knx5.1.1 and
miniroot-knx5.1.1.gz files. If you named your files something else, be
sure to change the names here as well. Because I am mostly dealing with
servers, I added 2 after init=/etc/init on the append line, so it would boot
into runlevel 2 (console-only mode). If you want to boot to a full
graphical environment, remove 2 from the append line.
</p><p>
The final step might be the largest for you if you don't have an NFS server
set up. For Knoppix to boot over the network, you have to have its CD
contents shared on an NFS server. NFS server configuration is beyond the
scope of this article, but in my example, I set up an NFS share on 10.0.0.1
at /mnt/knoppix/5.1.1. I then mounted my Knoppix CD and copied the full
contents to that directory. Alternatively, you could mount a Knoppix CD
or ISO directly to that directory. When the Knoppix kernel boots, it will
then mount that NFS share and access the rest of the files it needs
directly over the network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24da9a0"></a>
Extra Features: Memtest86+</h2></div></div><p>
Another nice addition to a PXE environment is the memtest86+ program. This
program does a thorough scan of a system's RAM and reports any errors.
These days, some distributions even install it by default and make it
available during the boot process because it is so useful. Compared to
Knoppix, it is very simple to add memtest86+ to your PXE server, because it
runs from a single bootable file. First, install your distribution's
memtest86+ package (most make it available), or otherwise download it from
the memtest86+ site. Then, copy the program binary to
/var/lib/tftpboot/memtest. Finally, add a new label to your
pxelinux.cfg/default file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
label 3
        kernel memtest
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. When you type 3 at the boot prompt, the memtest86+ program 
loads over the network and starts the scan.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e1580.0x24dab58"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There are a number of extra features beyond the ones I give here. For instance,
a number of DOS boot floppy images, such as Peter Nordahl's NT Password and
Registry Editor Boot Disk, can be added to a PXE environment. My own use of
the pxelinux menu helps me streamline server kickstarts and makes it
simple to kickstart many servers all at the same time. At boot time, I can
not only indicate which OS to load, but also more specific options, such as
the type of server (Web, database and so forth) to install, what hostname to use, and
other very specific tweaks. Besides the benefit of no longer tracking down
MAC addresses, you also can create a nice colorful user-friendly boot menu
that can be documented, so it's simpler for new administrators to pick up.
Finally, I've been able to customize Knoppix disks so that they do very
specific things at boot, such as perform load tests or even set up a Webcam
server&mdash;all from the network.
