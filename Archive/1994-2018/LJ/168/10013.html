Does that really say 100 years?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffb580.0x20f3408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is indeed an exciting evening, Fran&ccedil;ois. This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
marks the 100th Cooking with Linux column by your humble
<span   class="emphasis"><em>patron</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. You've done an excellent job on the decorations,
Fran&ccedil;ois. I am very impressed, but I do have one question. Don't
you think there's something just slightly wrong with the giant cake
you ordered for this event? You do not see it? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon ami</em></span>, it says,
&ldquo;Congratulations, Cooking with Linux, on being 100 years old!&rdquo; the column
is 100 issues old, not 100 years. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span>
</p><p>
I can see our guests approaching even now, Fran&ccedil;ois. Please, get the
door. Welcome! Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, the meeting place
of great Linux and open-source software and exceptional wines. Your
tables are waiting, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, so please sit and make yourselves
comfortable.
</p><p>
Tonight, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, we are privileged to count among our guests,
internationally renowned wine writer, Decanter World Wine Awards chair
and member of the Order of Canada, Tony Aspler. For those of you who may
not know, the Order of Canada represents Canada's highest civil honor. He
has graciously agreed to select a wine for us tonight. Your suggestion,
Tony?
</p><p>
&ldquo;This is a wine to drink with duck breast, for apres-ski, romantic
situations, wakes or software writing: Le Clos Jordanne Vineyard Pinot Noir
2005&mdash;medium ruby colour; a nose of dried flowers, minerals and raspberries;
richly extracted; velvety mouthfeel; firm but elegant with a long
cranberry and pomegranate finish. A lovely wine to drink now or hold
for 2&ndash;3 years. Five stars!&rdquo;
</p><p>
An excellent recommendation! Thank you! And, as it turns out, we happen
to have several bottles in our cellar. Fran&ccedil;ois, please hurry down
and fetch the wine for our guests. While my faithful waiter goes for
the wine, and before I introduce the first item on tonight's menu,
my sincere thanks to Tony Aspler for suggesting tonight's wine.
</p><p>
System administration sounds like something the computer person at your
company does in the server room, but anybody using a desktop computer
of any kind also plays administrator from time to time. If you've
ever spent time looking for old files to clean up, you've done system
administration. Have you ever added and configured a printer? Backed
up your files? Created folders and reorganized your music files into
categories? Installed a new game? Yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, every one of those
examples represents part of what system administration is. On the surface,
it may not sound like fun, and although some of it is the drudgery
of keeping your system up and running properly, there is a lighter side
to maintaining your system, from setting the default look and feel of
your desktop to activating some serious eye candy.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please, pour for our guests.
</p><p>
Historically, system administration may have gotten its ubergeek
reputation due to the command-line-intensive nature of administration.
In
the sleek and modern world that is today's desktop Linux, command-line
administration, though still available, is relegated to
the past for most users. GNOME users can find everything they need to administer their
systems in the top panel menus, starting with the System menu. If you
need help, this is the place to start, because the GNOME help system is
available from the System menu. You also can lock your screen with a
password (when you run off for coffee or a muffin), or log out of your
current Linux session.
</p><p>
Right at the top of the System menu is the Preferences submenu (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f1.large.jpg"><img src="10013f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The
Preferences submenu allows you to change your personal settings.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffb580.0x20f3e58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
The screenshot in Figure 1 is from an Ubuntu live
DVD, which is why you can see that install icon and Examples folder on
the screen. The Examples folder contains a number of sample documents,
spreadsheets, images and multimedia files to try with your Ubuntu Linux
system. 
</p></div><p>
The Preferences menu is all about personalizing the user
experience. Because these are personal options, none of them require
administrative privileges, even though these are still considered
administrative functions. You can set a screensaver, change the
background and window decorations, or play with the colors. If the fonts
look a little small, there's a simple option for changing the size of
what you see on the screen. And speaking of your screen, changing the
screen resolution is easy and doesn't require you to restart your
graphical environment.
</p><p>
Let's take one more step down into the System menu and look at the
Administration submenu (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f2.large.jpg"><img src="10013f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Administration submenu is the starting point to configure your network,
check logs, install software and more.
</p></div></div><p>
Granted, when you go from Preferences to Administration, it does sound
a bit scarier, but drink a little more wine, relax, and it will all seem
friendlier shortly. From time to time, you will want to do things on
your system that affect everyone who logs in equally. Changes made under
Preferences don't affect anyone but the current user, and if your niece,
Stephanie, chooses some garish desktop colors, it won't affect you when
you log in. Making sure everybody gets treated equally isn't all there
is to it. The Administration functions cover the gamut from setting up
a printer to configuring your Internet access. You can share folders
(so others on your home or office network can use them), look at system
logs, change the look and feel of the login screen and add users.
</p><p>
Perhaps one of the most important functions here involves updating and
maintaining the packages on your system. Staying up to date is one of
the best ways to keep your system humming along nicely and securely.
</p><p>
All right, let's look at how KDE does things when it comes to system
administration. Currently, there's a transition happening
in the KDE world, and it's a fairly major one. The venerable and
powerful KDE 3.5 is making way for the new, improved, and in many ways,
very different, KDE 4 desktop. To ease transition, certain things started
changing later in the KDE 3.5 releases. One of those things had to do with
system administration, as the old KDE Control Center was slowly replaced
by System Settings (command name, <tt  >systemsettings</tt>). System
Settings is more intuitive, easier to navigate and easier to work
with. From System Settings, you can change the look and feel of your
system, configure hardware, networking, sound, printers and a host
of other things. You'll usually see System Settings directly under the
program launcher menu. On KDE 4's Kickoff launcher, look for it under the
computer icon. When the System Settings window appears, you'll see a
two-tabbed view, with an Advanced tab in the background and the General
tab selected by default (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f3.large.jpg"><img src="10013f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The
Systems Settings dialog from KDE 4.0 gives you access to most desktop
administration functions.
</p></div></div><p>
General settings are broken up into four major categories: Look &amp; Feel,
Personal, Network &amp; Connectivity and Computer Administration (isn't
it all administration?). Although many settings affect personal desktop
settings, other functions that can affect the entire system do require
Administrator privileges. In those cases, you'll see a button to activate
system privileges.
</p><p>
Of course, I did mention that administering your system could involve
playing with some serious flash, pizzaz and glitzy eye candy. KDE 4 users
get a serious dose of this with the new Kwin composite desktop and its
plasma desktop and related toys. Simply click the Desktop icon from the
General tab (under Look &amp; Feel), then, under the two-tabbed window that
appears, check Enable desktop effects. Select all the so-called
common effects, then click on the All Effects tab (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f4.large.jpg"><img src="10013f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. For serious
eye candy, KDE 4 users can turn a little of their administration time
over to some glitzier pursuits.
</p></div></div><p>
Under this All Effects section, you'll find lots of great desktop
toys. Some of them are strange little special effects, and others are
actually quite useful enhancements to your desktop experience. For
instance, there's a magnifier tool that magnifies the section of the
desktop that is under the mouse pointer. For some, trying to find
the cursor on that busy desktop is sometimes difficult&mdash;a task
that can be made even more taxing by your choice of color and desktop
theme. Have no fear, as yet another cool desktop effect comes to your
rescue. Activate the Track Mouse effect. When you next lose your cursor,
activate the mouse tracker by pressing the Crtl and Meta key. Five bright
yellow stars appear orbiting the mouse pointer (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f5.large.jpg"><img src="10013f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Lost your
mouse pointer? We can find it for you, surrounded by stars.
</p></div></div><p>
Although there are preset key defaults, many of these can be overridden by
clicking on the Settings button next to the listed effect. For instance,
you may not like the key sequence provided for the Looking Glass effect
(the Meta key on my notebook is the so-called Windows key, and I might
not want that). Once the Settings button is clicked, a small window 
appears with the default keyboard shortcuts selected (Figure 6). You
can click on the key sequence and make your change. If you muck things up,
you always can press the Defaults button to return things to normal.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f6.large.jpg"><img src="10013f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Default
key and mouse combinations for various effects can be edited by clicking
the Settings button.
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, useful is open to interpretation. One of the effects lets you
use your mouse pointer to draw on your desktop. You can make windows and decorations
translucent or have objects fade away on the screen. You can dim active
windows or fade parent windows when configuration dialogs appear (Figure
6). You may find it useful to have windows explode
when you close them. Or, it may be better for your productivity to have them
fall into a thousand pieces (Figure 7). Be warned; if you choose the
exploding or falling-apart window effect, even tooltips explode when
they close.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10013f7.large.jpg"><img src="10013f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Windows look
better when they fall apart as they close.
</p></div></div><p>
There are several different effects to play with, all of
which should impact your productivity nicely, at least for a little
while. And remember, if your <span   class="emphasis"><em>patron</em></span> ever comes by your desk and asks
what you are doing with all these fancy exploding windows, animations
and what not, say you are doing your job&mdash;system administration.
</p><p>
We may well be able to change just about anything on our systems, but
sadly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, there is little we can do to change the time on
the wall. There is still plenty of wine, however, and Fran&ccedil;ois will be
offering some of that amazing 100th birthday cake along with some
fantastic caf&eacute; au lait after you finish your wine. In closing this 100th
Cooking with Linux, I want to thank you all for coming each and every
month. My thanks also to Tony Aspler for his wine suggestion and to my
ever-faithful waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois. When you've finished taking your bows,
Fran&ccedil;ois, please make sure everyone's glass is refilled.
</p><p>
Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's
health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
