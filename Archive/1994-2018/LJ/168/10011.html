Incessant status updates to your cell phone from the command
line? Sure, with a little help from curl and Twitter. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4f580.0x10474b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you've been around the Linux and UNIX world as long as I have (is it 
really going on 30 years? How could that be?), you'll be familiar with the 
various attempts at multiperson chat that have come down the pipeline, 
from simple command-line tools to the curses-based &ldquo;talk&rdquo; program to 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chaos. Occasionally fun, but often a complete 
waste of time, there's still something appealing about having an open line 
with a circle of friends and colleagues.
</p><p>
A few years ago, that mantle was assumed by the status line in Facebook, 
where hard-core users update their status throughout the day to reflect
the 
meetings they're attending, conferences they're involved with, dates with 
their spouses or significant others, concerts, fights with parents and so
on. 
The problem is, that's useful only if the people in your circle are also rabid 
Facebook fanatics&mdash;a shortcoming that's true of any of these services, of 
course.
</p><p>
Simultaneously, flashmob instigators found that Web-based tools could help 
them organize, and services like Dodgeball were created. (A flashmob is a 
spontaneous gathering of people organized by cell phone or text messaging.)
Dodgeball was bought by Google and then strung out to die, but the meme 
of status messages as a form of shared communication continued to evolve, 
and the latest evolution is a weird, sometimes overly voyeuristic, on-line 
service called Twitter (visit <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_self">twitter.com</a>).
</p><p>
During the past few months, I have found Twitter oddly compelling, in a 
manner perhaps analogous to Jimmy Stewart being unable to tear himself 
away from his binoculars in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rear Window</em></span> (even while the breathtakingly 
gorgeous Grace Kelly was administering to him, but that's another column 
entirely). Twitter is immediately useful if a group of people are at a 
conference, allowing you to meet up easily for meals, evening activities, 
shared cab rides and so on, but it's also rather fun to keep a running 
commentary of your goings-on and know what your friends and associates 
are doing too.
</p><p>
Twitter works directly from a Web page and also is completely short 
message service (SMS)-compliant too, so it's extraordinarily cell-phone-friendly, adding significantly to its utility.
</p><p>
Okay, nice history lesson. What about some sort of shell script, Dave?
</p><p>
What makes Twitter interesting to me is that like so many modern Web 
services, it has a public application programming interface (API) that
makes 
it both easy and fun to hack and fiddle with. Although some of the so-called 
Web 2.0 services are still closed, more and more are making their back ends
accessible to open queries, creating many possibilities for darn
interesting 
shell scripts and more sophisticated software and mashups.
</p><p>
For this column, I want to show you how incredibly easy it is to
update 
your Twitter status from the Linux command line, and then noodle a bit on how 
this could be used for useful, interesting or just mundane tasks. To
tantalize 
you, imagine that you could launch a big software build and have it text
your 
cell phone when it was done, rather than you having to sit at your office.
</p><p>
First, though, you can find the API at <a href="http://twitter.com/help/api" target="_self">twitter.com/help/api</a>. Read 
through it, and you'll find that just about all interactions are done with 
specially constructed URLs. That's good, because it's easy to manipulate 
and tweak a string within a shell script.
</p><p>
The most basic use of the Twitter API is to send a status update message to 
your account. Here's an example of how to do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl --basic --user "$user:$pass" --data-ascii \
  "status=testing123" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see one of the big challenges of writing this as a shell script 
already. User validation is done through sending an account name and 
password pair, and that means you're probably going to have the 
password embedded in your script. Never a good idea. But, prompting 
for it each and every time you want to send an update isn't good either. 
</p><p>
Before we address that though, notice how I'm utilizing the wonderful 
curl utility&mdash;a must-have for your Linux distro. If you don't have it,
grab a copy from <a href="http://curl.haxx.se" target="_self">curl.haxx.se</a>. curl makes it very
easy to 
work with Web pages via the command line, and I consider it essential for any 
modern shell script programmer.
</p><p>
Looking back at the command invoked, you'll notice that the URL to which 
we are going to send the update is status/update.json. Read the API, and 
you'll notice that it supports four different output formats, all of which
are 
a pain to parse within a script, unfortunately. One of those is json, and
it 
re-occurs here as the update-receiving URL address.
</p><p>
If you've already worked with Web sites from the command line, you know 
there are lots of illegal characters that cannot be included in URLs
and, 
by extension, on command lines of utilities that interact with the Web,
such as 
curl. As a result, one of the tasks of our send.twitter.update script
will be 
to make all of the necessary substitutions before sending the new status 
message to the Twitter server.
</p><p>
On a lightweight service like Twitter, I think it's probably crazy to go 
through too many hoops to ensure security, so I actually will be including 
the account name and password in the script. Given some of the suggested 
applications we'll explore later, it makes sense to create a new
Twitter 
account just for the command-line updates, in which case, a shared password 
isn't that big a problem anyway.
</p><p>
Here's a first stab at a simple stu (sent twitter update) script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

user="DaveTaylor"
pass="--mypw-- "
curl="/usr/bin/curl"

$curl --basic --user "$user:$pass" --data-ascii \
  "status=`echo $@ | tr ' ' '+'`" \
  "http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json"

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
In use, simply type in the script name and desired status update:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ stu Writing makes me sleepy
{"user":{"name":"Dave Taylor","description":"Blogger, entrepreneur, 
public speaker, 
dad!","screen_name":"DaveTaylor","profile_image_url":"http:\/\/s3.amazon
aws.com\/twitter_production\/profile_images\/35534842\/dticon_normal.gif"
,"location":"Boulder, 
Colorado","url":"http:\/\/www.AskDaveTaylor.com\/","id":9973392,"protect
ed":false},"created_at":"Sat Jan 12 21:31:37 +0000 
2008","truncated":false,"text":"Writing makes me 
sleepy","source":"web","id":592217322}
$
</pre>
</p><p>
Eek. That's a scary output, isn't it? So, before wrapping up this column, I 
strongly suggest that immediately after the invocation of curl, you append 
<tt  >&gt;&amp; /dev/null</tt>, so you can discard the output. If you want to be fancy,
check 
<tt  >$?</tt> to see whether it's nonzero, but let's talk about that level of improvement
in the 
next column.
