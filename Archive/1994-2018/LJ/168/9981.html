What's cooler than a box of rocks? Well, a lot, but not much is cooler
than Rockbox on your iPod!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1308348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Wouldn't it be great if you could customize an iPod and run 
third-party software on it? Wouldn't it be great if you could download games and
applications along with the songs and videos you already have? Wouldn't
it be great if all those features were open source and
free? Wish no longer. Rockbox offers all those things,
wrapped in an easy-to-use installer. 
</p><p>
Rockbox is an open-source firmware replacement for a variety of music
and video players. The interface is very similar, regardless of the
device, and as I don't have access to anything other than an iPod,
this review focuses on it. You certainly don't need an
iPod to use Rockbox, but because Apple's products are so popular, I was
happy to see a wide variety of iPod models are supported. Check out
the Rockbox Web site to see whether your media player will work. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x13085b0"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To get Rockbox on your iPod, the developers offer two options, automatic
and manual. 
The automatic option appealed to my lazy nature, but unfortunately,
it didn't
work for me. I think this was largely because my iPod was formatted with
the HFS (Apple) filesystem instead of the FAT32 (Windows) filesystem. On an iPod with the FAT32 filesystem, the automatic installer is very
slick and downloads the latest version of the programs directly from
the Internet. I wish the automatic installer had worked for me off
the bat, because then I could have just suggested you use it (which I
still do) and forget about the manual stuff.
</p><p>
Thankfully, the documentation is very helpful even if you are forced
to use the manual method. Here's a brief overview of the procedure,
but be sure to read the documentation before attempting it on your
own. It's not terribly difficult, but it requires extensive use of
the command line. My suggestion is to try the automatic installation
program first, and resort to the following method only if the installer doesn't
work for you. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1308710"></a>
Manual Installation Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Go to <a href="http://www.rockbox.org" target="_self">www.rockbox.org</a>, and click on Manual at the left. Find
your specific device on the list, and go to the instruction manual
provided. The installation section is helpful, and following it
will ensure success. Here's a rundown of the steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
If you have an iPod that was formatted for use with OS X, you
need to convert the filesystem to FAT32. You either can plug the
iPod in to a Windows machine and have iTunes reformat it, or follow
the directions provided in the Rockbox manual to reformat it with Linux
command-line tools. 
</p></li><li><p>
Download the appropriate version of Rockbox from the Web site
and extract it directly to the iPod. If done properly, there should be a
folder on the iPod called .rockbox with the program inside. It should
be at the root level of the iPod (not the root level of your computer),
and because it starts with a dot, it won't be visible by default. 
</p></li><li><p>
Next, download the font package, available from the Extras section
on the Web site. The font package is the same, regardless of what media
player you have, so you can't go wrong when downloading it. Just like
with the Rockbox software, the fonts need to be extracted at the root
level of the iPod. (The fonts actually reside inside the .rockbox
folder, but the zip file is designed to be extracted at the root level
of the iPod, and it will put them in the correct place.)
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, install the Rockbox bootloader. This is the
part that causes the iPod firmware to load Rockbox instead of the
original iPod software. Download the Linux version of ipodpatcher
(link provided in the installation manual), and execute it as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# chmod +x ipodpatcher
# sudo ./ipodpatcher
</pre>
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Assuming all goes well, you should see a message telling you the bootloader has been installed. Feel free to do a happy dance, and then
hold down Menu + Select to reboot your iPod into Rockboxy goodness
(Figure 1). If you have problems along the way, and corrupt the
partitions on your iPod (as I did once), just plug it back in to your iTunes
machine, allow it to repair itself, and start over.

Rockbox Features at Your Fingertips</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have Rockbox installed, let's talk a bit about what you
can do with it. Yes, with a name like Rockbox, your iPod now sounds
threatening and weapon-like. And sure, if you throw it hard enough,
you probably could hurt someone with it, but really, there are more
productive things to do with your new media player. Let's look at a few.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1308ef8"></a>
Games</h2></div></div><p>
Apple ships iPods with a few games, and the newer models allow you
to purchase additional ones, but the sheer number of Rockbox's available
titles leaves the commercial alternatives in the dust. Although many of the
games are the type you'd expect to see on a device the size of an iPod,
one game surprised me&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>. Seriously, as hard as it is to believe,
id Software's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> runs natively on the iPod (Figure
2). I'll admit, controlling it was a bit awkward, but there it was in
all its glory.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9981f2.large.jpg"><img src="9981f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Here's <span  class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> running on the iPod Mini. No, really, it is.
</p></div></div><p>
Although high on the cool factor, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> wasn't the best game available.
I found <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bubbles</em></span> (much
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>)
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jewels</em></span> (much like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span>)
to be the most fun. Just like the computer version of
these games, their iPod counterparts easily will suck hours of productivity
from your life. You've been warned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1309528"></a>
Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Along with the games, Rockbox also includes a handful of applications.
The metronome was particularly useful, and the text
editor was particularly difficult. I'm impressed there is a text editor
at all, but the interface is severely limited by the lack of buttons.
I'd rather use a cell phone to text-message an entire novel than try
to write an article of this size with the Rockbox text editor. Still,
it's nice to have the option. One oddity worth mentioning is
that there's not really a standard way to exit games and applications
once they start. Sometimes, pressing the menu button exits.
Sometimes, you must press the select and menu buttons. Other programs
require you to press play and select in order to get back to the main
Rockbox program. I'm sure this is because the different programs (or
plugins, as they are called in the Rockbox interface) are developed by
separate programmers, but I wish there was a standard in place regarding
how to exit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1309630"></a>
Other Stuff</h2></div></div><p>
Along with games and applications, there's also a group of programs
called demos. If you were a computer user back in the early 1990s,
you may remember hacking groups releasing what they called demos,
in which they would show off their programming skills and push the
graphics processors of the time to their limits. These Rockbox programs
follow a similar road, and the demos mainly show off the iPod's
graphics and processor. They aren't useful for much more than oohs and
aahs, but they do make for interesting conversation starters. The demos vary from a simple
starfield simulation to a 3-D cube to a complex digital
fire scene. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1309790"></a>
Oh, It Also Plays Music and Video</h2></div></div><p>
Rockbox has a plugin (again, that's what these add-on programs are called)
that allows playback of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video. The main focus of the
program, however, is to play music. Rockbox supports pretty much
any non-DRM music file, and Rockbox claims the audio playback is better
quality than with the original iPod software. Honestly, I can't tell
the difference, but perhaps audiophiles will notice the
improvement. Locating and playing files is done mainly by traversing
the folder structure on the drive. Rockbox also can
create a database of information (Artist, Album and so forth), but
unfortunately, it can't read the database created by iTunes. To add insult to injury,
if you try to find songs placed on the drive by iTunes, you'll find
cryptically named files in equally cryptically named folders.
</p><p>
Playlists are created easily in Rockbox, and it's possible to create
and save several playlists on the fly. They are standard M3U files, so
uploading a playlist you've created on a computer is a fairly painless
endeavor. Because the Rockbox iPod mounts as a standard USB drive,
manipulating songs and playlists from the computer is literally as
easy as dragging and dropping. Most Linux-based MP3-playing software,
like Amarok or Rhythmbox, will recognize the Rockbox player as well.
There's really not a best way to handle music management; it's 
a matter of personal taste.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1210580.0x1309948"></a>
The Verdict?</h2></div></div><p>
What Rockbox does, it does very well, and very completely. I found
the installation procedure easy enough that everyone should be able to
accomplish it, and yet it was geeky enough that I felt a level of satisfaction
when it was complete. The number of features Rockbox has compared with the
standard iPod software is astronomical, but that's only a good thing
if you're looking for lots of features in your media player. Let
me explain.
</p><p>
I installed Rockbox, and played with games, demos and applications for a
long time. Then, I played some music and realized one of the advantages
the original iPod software has over Rockbox&mdash;simplicity. If you
just want to listen to music, without the complexity of multiple dynamic
playlists, auto/manual-generated databases, playlist queue positions
and sound file gap lengths, you might want to consider sticking with
the original software. Thankfully, the developers even have admitted that
to themselves and offer a painless way to run the original software
right alongside the new. If you reboot your iPod (hold down menu and
select for 3&ndash;5 seconds) and immediately toggle the hold switch, the
iPod boots the original firmware. So if you like everything about
the Rockbox music player, except the way it plays music, don't worry;
you can have the best of both worlds. Well done, Rockbox.

Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
I'm sure on an iPod with a color display, the features would have been
even more visually appealing. Running it on the iPod Mini
was a good way to compare it to the simplicity of the Apple firmware
though. Rockbox does exactly what it says it will do. It met all my
expectations and exceeded them in many areas (namely, the quality and
quantity of games). Oddly enough, however, more often than not I found
myself booting the iPod into the original Apple firmware. That's not
to say I don't reboot into Rockbox when I have time to play around,
but for listening to music, I have to give the advantage to Apple.
The one thing I'm thankful for, is that with Rockbox, at least I have a
choice. My choice is to keep both operating systems on board, because
quite honestly, they're both great.
