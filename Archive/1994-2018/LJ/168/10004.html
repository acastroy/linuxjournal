If digging through your server e-mail bogs you down, use these tips
to organize and tweak your mutt configuration and cut through that mailbox
like a letter opener through an envelope.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c9580.0x28c13b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I am one of those people who stores everything in e-mail. Travel
reservations, phone numbers&mdash;if it is in an e-mail message, I know one way or 
another I can find the information. That might be one of the reasons I have
been using mutt as my main mail program both at home and work for years. It
is difficult to beat when you need to read, search and navigate large
mailboxes full of mail. That, and it has vi-style key bindings. I love
vi-style key bindings.
</p><p>
If you are a sysadmin, there are even more reasons to love mutt. For one, you
probably spend a good deal of your day in front of a terminal, so why not
read your mail from there as well? A lot of administrators like to run
stripped-down servers that don't include binaries for X or graphical tools,
but mutt is small, and what's more, you can <tt  >ssh</tt> to a server or your work
desktop from another machine and check your mail.
</p><p>
At work, I like to segregate my e-mail into folders, based on whether a
message is
from a person or a server (and, of course, I segregate them further from there).
If you manage a lot of servers, those mailboxes can start to get rather
large. Almost nothing compares to mutt when you need to open a
mailbox with a few thousand new messages. This brings me to my first
almost-essential mutt tweak: header caching.
</p><p>
Header caching is a feature that has shown up in mutt only in the past few
years. Essentially, it allows mutt to cache the headers from mailboxes,
so that the next time you load the mailbox, it has to pull down only the new
messages. This is particularly handy with IMAP servers or even large local
mailboxes.
</p><p>
To enable header caching, create a directory called .muttheaders in your
home directory, then add the following line to your ~/.muttrc, and
restart mutt or reload your mutt config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set header_cache="~/.muttheaders/"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c9580.0x28c17d0"></a>
Separate Mutt Configs</h2></div></div><p>
This tweak is, in some ways, more organizational, and it's handy not only for
sysadmins but also for anyone who runs mutt on multiple machines. Many mutt
guides will tell you to split .muttrc into multiple files for different
types of configuration, so you can have one file that has all of your color
options, another with your key bindings and so forth. Then, you simply can add a
source line to your .muttrc file that points to the new file, and mutt will
load those options as well.
</p><p>
What I like to do is take it a step further and create a .mutt directory in
my home directory and place all of those files
<span   class="emphasis"><em>including</em></span> my .muttrc in
that directory. Then, I create a new file in my home directory called
.muttrc.local. In this file, I store any options that are specific to just
that particular machine (IMAP settings, local mailbox locations and so on) and
keep the rest of the options organized in different files in the .mutt
directory. Finally, I create a symlink from ~/.mutt/.muttrc to ~/.muttrc, so
mutt still will be able to find it. In this .muttrc, you would find
source lines like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
source ~/.muttrc.local
source ~/.mutt/colors
source ~/.mutt/aliases
source ~/.mutt/mailboxes
</pre>
</p><p>
The advantage to this arrangement is that once I make a change to any of
the files in .mutt, I simply can <tt  >rsync</tt> that entire directory to any other
machine on which I run mutt, and all of my changes will be there. If I didn't
segregate these to a directory and separate .muttrc.local, I would have to
worry that any local settings from one machine would clobber the rest.

Colorize Important Words</h2></div></div><p>
If you read through a lot of cron, Nagios or other e-mail your servers
generate for you, it's easy to let your eyes glaze over and miss
important content. What I like to do is tweak my mutt configuration so that
certain words, like warning, are colored in bright yellow, and words like
error and fail show up in bright red. This is surprisingly easy to do with
mutt in only a few lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
color body brightyellow default warning
color body brightred default error
color body white default 'no error'
color body brightred default "fail(ure|ed)?"
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the line that matches no error. I noticed that some messages said
&ldquo;no error&rdquo; in them, and the error section still was being colored red. If
this happens with your keywords, simply add a similar line in there to
override the previous less-specific match. You don't have to limit yourself
to just these keywords. For instance, you also could highlight
certain server names with a particular color or assign different data-center locations distinct colors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c9580.0x28c1d50"></a>
Read Important Messages First</h2></div></div><p>
Once I had colorized all my e-mail, it was great&mdash;I would browse through
output and more critical e-mail would jump to my attention. As the number of
messages started to grow though, I noticed I would spend a lot of time
reading the less-important messages before I found the important ones. My
solution was to use the limit feature in mutt. When you are in the index
view in mutt (where mutt shows you only the From and the Subject lines),
you can tell mutt to limit (the l key by default) the headers you currently can
see based on a pattern. 
</p><p>
For instance, if I wanted to see only all the headers that said Bob, I
could type <tt  >l</tt> and then <tt  >Bob</tt>
&lt;Enter&gt;. Then, to see all the headers again, I
could type <tt  >l</tt> and then <tt  >all</tt> &lt;Enter&gt; to show all messages. You also
can have mutt search within the body of messages, so I created a mutt macro that I
bound to the F3 key, so that when I see the full list of headers and press F3,
it limits the view only to new messages that contained error or fail
in them. I could read those messages first and then change the limit back
to all and tab through the rest. Here is the extra line in my .muttrc to
create the macro:


<pre     class="programlisting">

macro index &lt;F3&gt; "l~N ~b \"([\^nN][\^oO].error|[Ff][Aa][Ii][Ll])\"&lt;enter&gt;"

</pre>
</p><p>
I constantly am surprised with how far you can extend mutt. It is
definitely one of those programs that gives your time back in gained
productivity as you learn more about its configuration options. If you use
your e-mail to remember things, or dig through a large stack of server e-mail
every day (or even if you don't), mutt is an invaluable e-mail companion that
always has new tricks.
