<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #168, April 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Jones</b></span> has tracked down every available kernel release,
prerelease, release-candidate and what-not, right down to Linux
version 0.01, and created a 2GB git repository of the whole
thing, at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davej/history.git. For
almost half of the thousand or so commits, Dave also has scoured the
mailing lists and retrieved changelog entries. This represents the
most complete <span   class="bold"><b>Linux repository</b></span> ever
compiled, although unfortunately, it
does seem as though some kernel versions have been truly lost forever.
Also, unlike current kernel development, Dave's repository does not
have a patch-by-patch accounting of every change, because no record
was ever kept of those individual changes. Only the versions actually
released by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> have come down to us, each of which
represents dozens or hundreds of individual patches, mashed
together as one. Given the wacky nature of some of these kernel
hackers, it's possible that various folks will try to correct and
expand Dave's repository during the coming years, and there's no telling
how detailed it might become over time. Linus has volunteered to
recompose changelog entries from memory, if other people do the work
of gathering the patches together. Now Dave has a big pile of
commits ready for Linus to make good on; once he's done with that,
maybe someone will have more commits for him to comment on. In the
meantime, Dave already has accomplished something of tremendous
benefit to anyone interested in the history of kernel development.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> has started a daring attempt to give Linux systems the
ability to go to <span   class="bold"><b>sleep</b></span> in response to one
desired event and to <span   class="bold"><b>wake
up</b></span> in response to another. The path is fraught with difficulties&mdash;the
main one being the plethora of hardware in the world, all
with different bugs and behaviors. Trying to support this
feature universally will be like threading a very strange and
complicated needle. Most of the early comments from other kernel folks
were along the lines of &ldquo;this can't be done&rdquo;&mdash;to which Pavel
essentially responded, &ldquo;well, not fully, no, but this really cool part
might be doable&rdquo;. So, by the end of the discussion, various folks
ended up suggesting other really cool parts that might be doable
as well. All in all, it looks to be a very piecemeal project, but one
with fun results. Pavel envisions a system that might wake up playing
particular MP3s in the morning or if particular network traffic comes
down the wire. With so many folks starting to show interest, it may
turn out that the whole thing is doable, one way or the other.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Borislav Petkov</b></span> has taken over
maintainership of the <span   class="bold"><b>IDE-CD driver</b></span>, in
the wake of a major code reworking by <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej
Zolnierkiewicz</b></span>.
Bartlomiej had done this as a one-off, just to bring the driver back
into a maintainable state. Because it hadn't had a maintainer for quite
a while, all the fixes and other changes going into it had tended to
make the code uglier and more difficult to understand. Bartlomiej's
work cleaned up the code and also made it easier for the <span   class="bold"><b>libata
ATAPI developers</b></span> and others to identify all the hardware special
cases they'll need to code around in their own projects. With the
driver now in a workable state, Borislav should have a fairly
straightforward time carrying it along.
</p><p>
There have been some other <span   class="bold"><b>maintainership
changes</b></span> recently. <span   class="bold"><b>Hans-Jurgen
Koch</b></span> has teamed up with <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> as co-maintainers of <span   class="bold"><b>UIO</b></span>
(Userspace Input/Output). <span   class="bold"><b>Swen Schillig</b></span> also recently stepped down as
the <span   class="bold"><b>zFCP</b></span> maintainer, saying the project was about to undergo a major
rewrite, and he didn't have time to shepherd it through that. Instead,
he's patched the MAINTAINERS file to list <span   class="bold"><b>Christof
Schmitt</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Miartin
Peschke</b></span> as the new co-maintainers during the rewrite, although they probably
will continue to be the maintainers after the new code settles.
Additionally, <span   class="bold"><b>Joe Perches</b></span> has removed the
<span   class="bold"><b>TMS380 Token-Ring Network Driver</b></span> entry
from the MAINTAINERS file, formerly maintained by <span   class="bold"><b>Adam Fritzler</b></span>.
</p><p>
While Joe was making that change, he also updated Adam's e-mail address
wherever it appeared in the kernel tree. As a result of this,
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> initiated a new policy of
keeping all contributor e-mail
addresses in a single location, giving their names in the
various files they touched, so that if an address changed, it would
need to be updated only in one place. Joe fixed all the cases
involving Adam.
</p><p>
A variety of new drivers has been submitted into the kernel. Some of
these have been written recently, and others have been marinating in various forked
trees until now. <span   class="bold"><b>David Sterba's 3G UMTS PCMCIA card
wireless driver</b></span>
has been in Andrew Morton's -mm tree for a while, and he recently
submitted it to Linus Torvalds for inclusion in the main tree. After
various technical comments from a few different folks, Andrew endorsed
the patch and passed it up to Linus. Some code submissions this month
came from longer ago than that. <span   class="bold"><b>Harald
Welte</b></span> unearthed some work by
<span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Kleffel</b></span> to support the <span   class="bold"><b>Samsung S3C24xx SD/MMC controller</b></span>.
Thomas' work had never made it into the kernel proper and had grown
a bit stale in the intervening years. Harald had brought it up to date
with the current tree and the relevant APIs. He and Thomas planned
to share maintainership once the code was accepted formally. And,
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrzej Zaborowski</b></span> submitted the <span   class="bold"><b>OMAP1 PWL-based LCD backlight driver</b></span>
to Linus, after it had lived for some time in the OMAP tree.
</p><p>
Other driver submissions were more genuinely new than David's,
Andrzej's and Harald's work. <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas
Bogendoerfer</b></span> submitted a new
serial driver for <span   class="bold"><b>SC2681/SC2691 UARTs</b></span>,
used in some older <span   class="bold"><b>SNI RM400</b></span>
systems. <span   class="bold"><b>Alex Dubov</b></span> submitted a patch to
support <span   class="bold"><b>Sony's Memory Stick
card</b></span>, in spite of the card using a proprietary, unpublished protocol.
Speaking of supporting proprietary hardware, <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian
McMenamin</b></span> wrote a
CD-ROM driver for the <span   class="bold"><b>SEGA Dreamcast</b></span>. The driver supports the
proprietary <span   class="bold"><b>Giga Disk ROM</b></span> format (aka GD-ROM).
</p><p>
Among the numerous new drivers submitted this time around, several of
them were for system-monitoring systems. <span   class="bold"><b>Jochen
Friedrich's</b></span> submission
supports the watchdog timer on <span   class="bold"><b>Power QUICC</b></span> hardware. This driver
reboots the system if it is not touched periodically by software (that is,
if the system has crashed). <span   class="bold"><b>Darrick J.
Wong</b></span> wrote a driver to support
tracking volt, temperature and fan sensor readings on the <span   class="bold"><b>ADT 7473</b></span>
monitor chip. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Steve Hardy</b></span> submitted code to support the
<span   class="bold"><b>Burr-Brown/Texas-Instruments ADS7972</b></span>
12-bit, eight-channel A-D converter,
which monitors voltage on various off-the-shelf CPUs.

<h2 class="title">Linus on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #168, April 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In January 2008, Linus Torvalds was interviewed by Jim Zemlin for the inaugural
podcast of the Linux Foundation, for which both Linus and Jim now work.
Here are a few excerpts from a transcript of their dialogue, organized under
headings that highlight what's changed, what hasn't and what never will, as
long as Linus is leading Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;I have a policy that he who does the code gets to decide....But at the
end of the day, the only thing that matters is actual code and the
technology itself. And the people who are not willing to step up and write
that code, they can comment on it and they can say it should be done this
way or that way or they won't, but in the end, their voice doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters is code.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;...it doesn't matter at all who you work for pretty much because nobody
really cares.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...if you're in a tech company and you have interest in something like
the Linux kernel, the reason you have interest in the Linux kernel probably
has something to do with the kind of people you have working for
you.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;I think most companies have slowly started to learn...&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;...one misleading thing is thinking that people kind of share ideals
and goals, and that's not true. It's quite often the case that people have
completely different goals; you have commercial vendors who have their very
clear commercial goals and in the Open Source,
so-called community, you often find individuals who really don't like
commercial entities, especially not the big ones. So, quite often, the goals
are very different.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;Trust either comes or it does not come and it largely depends on your
actions.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...it used to be a huge issue when companies kind of were talking
about 'How do we interact with the community?'&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...when the real answer always ends up being you don't interact with
the community, you just act as a member of this non-existent
community.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...you don't interact with it, you are part of it.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;I think the thing that more people worry about is actually
interfaces.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;It makes more of a difference that the way you connect to a mobile phone
is different from the way you connect to a desktop. You have a very limited
keyboard, you have touchscreen issues, you have a very small screen, and I
think the bigger issues tend to be in things like the UI
interfaces.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;The lack of an ABI is twofold: one is we really, really, really don't
want one. Every single time people ask for a stable ABI, the main reason
for wanting a stable ABI is they want to have their binary drivers and they
don't want to give out source and they...certainly don't want to merge
that source into the stable kernel or the standard kernel.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;And that, in turn, means that all the people who actually do all the
kernel work and maintain the kernel are basically unable to work with that
piece of hardware and that vendor because if there's any bugs whatsoever,
we can't fix them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;So, all the commercial vendors&mdash;even the ones who used to accept
binary drivers&mdash;have moved or are moving away from wanting to have
anything at all to do with binary drivers because they're completely
unmaintainable.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...other projects...have binary interfaces for one reason or
another&mdash;quite often because of commercial reasons&mdash;and that just means that
they cannot fix their fundamental design.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;You need to have the code out there, not because of any social issues,
but simply because you don't know who's going to be the one who has to fix
it.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;There are certainly specific vendors who end up having more problems
than others. In fact, sometimes the same vendor may be very good in one
area and very bad in another area.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Broadcom is an example of this. They are&mdash;they have actually been
fairly good when it comes to high-end gigabit network devices, wired
network devices, but...when it comes to wireless networks and other more
consumer devices, they've been completely unable or unwilling to help us at
all.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;I'm fairly pragmatic, so I don't care, per se, about one particular
license or another. I want to pick the license that makes the most sense
for what I want to do. And at this point in time, Version 2 matches what I
think we want to do much, much better than Version 3.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...the GPL Version 3 reflects the FSF's goals and the GPL Version 2
pretty closely matches what I think a license should do and so right now
Version 2 is where the kernel is.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Could there be something that happens to change that? Maybe.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...I cannot change the license on my own anymore. I mean, because I
have accepted code over the last 15 years by people who kind of accepted my
original choice of the GPL Version 2, I'm not just, I think, ethically
bound by those people's choices. I am also actually legally bound.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&ldquo;...it's just a lot of fun working with people; even though, I mean, I
sit in my basement all day long and actually don't meet anybody at all, but
what I do is essentially communicate and it is very social...&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;...what drives, motivates me is the fun part. I mean, part of being fun
is that it should be difficult enough to not be trivial. So, fun doesn't
mean that it's frivolous; it just means it's interesting and
exciting.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Let's Call It a UVPC</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #168, April 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Technically, the Noahpad from E-Lead Electronic is a Linux-based UMPC, or
an Ultra-Mobile PC. Generally speaking, a UMPC is smaller than a notepad
and bigger than a Mobile Internet Device (MID). But, in fact, the
Noahpad is so versatile and odd, it may deserve another category
entirely.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10010uvpcf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The E-Lead Noahpad UMPC (ultra-mobile
PC) runs on Linux. 
</p></div></div><p>

Let's start with the keyboard. Its two springy squares are divided into what you
might call a bingo grid (5x5) of keys, all printed on the square and
separated by raised dark lines. These serve to keep your fingers on the
&ldquo;keys&rdquo;&mdash;an alternative to the conventional approach, which orients touch
via spaces between keys and convex bowls for your fingertips. Thus, the
Noahpad has just two (barely) moving &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; parts, even though the two
squares also add 50 function keys to the usual QWERTY lineup.
</p><p>
But, that's not the half of it. Both squares are touchpads&mdash;big ones. You
can go from typing to pointing without leaving the two pads. Navigation is
also novel. For example, you can use the touchpad to move around the window
view, expanding the perimeter of the screen desktop beyond the borders of
the screen itself.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, the 7" backlit 1040x768 display also is a touchscreen,
and it can pivot and flip around both sides of the base to become a writing
pad, a display or...you decide. E-Lead suggests many possible Noahpad
uses: a car GPS (with a larger screen than just about every standard
built-in or aftermarket GPS), a &ldquo;hangable&rdquo; multimedia player, a digital
photo frame and even a jogging companion. &ldquo;Classmate, roommate,
travelmate&rdquo;, the slogan goes.
</p><p>
Tech details: 1GHz VIA Eden CPU, 512MB of RAM, 30GB HD, 300k pixel cam,
Bluetooth, &ldquo;Ethernet 10m/100M USB to RJ45 dongle&rdquo;, 802.11b/g, external
3.5g compatibility, Wi-Fi and Ubuntu 7.10. For more information, visit

<h2 class="title">What Are They Using?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #168, April 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Angel Roman is a 24-year-old star software architect with the Bug Labs team
in New York. Bug Labs (subject of an UpFront piece in the December 2007
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>) is
becoming familiar in Linux circles as a hack-ready DIY hardware development
and assembly system. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2008, I got some
hang-time with the Bug Labs people and was especially impressed not just
with Angel, but also with how he had hacked together his own personal
assortment of Linux gear. Here's the rundown he provided at the constantly
crowded Bug Labs booth:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Handheld/UMPC (ultra-mobile PC): Nokia N810. &ldquo;It's a great
device&rdquo;, he
says. His main everyday use of it is reading books on the subway between his home
in the Bronx and Bug Labs' offices in Manhattan. &ldquo;I basically use a .pdf
reader, plus an e-mail client.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Phone: Motorola E6 ROKR. &ldquo;This is a Linux phone that I use as a GPRS modem
for my Nokia N810 over Bluetooth.&rdquo;

Laptop: Lenovo X61 tablet, running Ubuntu Linux. &ldquo;I looked at the new
Fujitsu 810. It was small with a resistance touchscreen, and the driver
didn't work so well. But Linux has support from Wacom. So I decided to get
a Wacom tablet. I previously had another ThinkPad that had Ubuntu working
perfectly. So I decided to stick with Lenovo, got the X61, and installed
the Wacom drivers....On an airplane, the screen re-orients. Somebody figured
that there's an accelerometer in the machine, and wouldn't it be nice if
you could guide <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> that way.&rdquo; Then, Angel picks up the machine and
moves it around as if steering a penguin down a ski slope. &ldquo;So I knew that
if I stuck with Lenovo, I'd have good support for drivers. And so far, that's
worked out.&rdquo; He makes heavy use of the X61 as a tablet. &ldquo;I can make use of
the whole screen area. And I found something called Cell Writer, which I
can train to know my handwriting. It works really well, and it's fast. You
can even suspend and resume. It's an excellent solution as a
tablet.&rdquo;
