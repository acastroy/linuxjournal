Nothing's perfect. That's why we'll never stop debugging everything.

Solutions might be useful, but problems are what make stories interesting.
That's why I like reading the Linux-Kernel Mailing List (LKML) and the
Kernel Trap Web site. I'm no hacker, and most of the work that's discussed
there is too arcane for me. But, there still are problems to follow, and
most of them lead somewhere.
</p><p>
Take the thread New Kernel Bugs, started by Natalie Protasevich on November
13, 2007. Andrew Morton followed by noting &ldquo;no response from
developers&rdquo; after most of the bugs, concluding:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So I count around seven reports that people are doing something with
and 27 that have been just ignored.
</p><p>
Three of these reports have been identified as regressions. All three
of those remain unresponded to.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
After many posts about particulars, David Miller added,
&ldquo;I think you like just saying 'No response from developers' over and
over again to make some point about how developers are ignoring lots of
bugs. That's fine, but at least be accurate about it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Andrew replied, &ldquo;Do you believe that our response to bug reports is
adequate?&rdquo;
</p><p>
David came back with:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Do you feel that making us feel and look like shit helps?
</p><p>
...When someone like me is bug fixing full time, I take massive offense
to the impression you're trying to give, especially when it's directed at
the networking.
</p><p>
So turn it down a notch Andrew.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Andrew replied:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
That doesn't answer my question.
</p><p>
See, first we need to work out whether we have a problem. If we do
this, then we can then think about what to do about it.
</p><p>
I tried to convince the 2006 KS attendees that we have a problem and I
resoundingly failed. People seemed to think that we're doing OK.
</p><p>
But it appears that data such as this contradicts that belief.
</p><p>
This is not a minor matter. If the kernel <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> slowly
deteriorating,
then this won't become readily apparent until it has been happening for a
number of years. By that stage, there will be so much work to do to get us
back to an acceptable level that it will take a huge effort. And it will
take a long time after that for the kernel to get its reputation back.
</p><p>
So it is important that we catch deterioration <span   class="emphasis"><em>early</em></span> if it is
happening.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ingo Molnar followed with a long post that ended with:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Paradoxically, the &ldquo;end product&rdquo; is still considerably good quality in
absolute terms because other pieces of our infrastructure are so good and
powerful, but QA is still a &ldquo;weak link&rdquo; of our path to the user that
reduces the quality of the end result. We could <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> be so much better
without any compromises that hurt.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Much discussion among many participants followed, about the &ldquo;new
development model&rdquo; and about policies and practices around bug-fixing,
patching and, in general, debugging the debugging process. The thread ran to
more than 100 posts, near as I can bother to count, over two days.
</p><p>
What stands out for me is how participatory it all is. Even its
disorganization has organized qualities to it. What organizes it, I think,
is respect for actual contribution. If it doesn't help, the principle says,
it doesn't matter. There is gravity there. It keeps conversation grounded
in the realities of actual contribution.
</p><p>
Linus has been saying this kind of thing for years. You can hear it again
in the interview excerpted in the UpFront section of this <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
issue. You also hear something new concerning the social side of kernel
development. Here's what Linus says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So, the technical sides are often easier in the sense that I don't get
frustrated. Okay, we've had a bug and we've hit our head against a
technical bug for a couple months and, yes, that can be slightly
frustrating, but at the same time, you always know it's
something that you are going to solve and...I never worry
about that.
</p><p>
The social side is maybe a bit more difficult in the sense that that
can be really frustrating and sometimes you don't solve the social problems
and people get upset, and I think that's very interesting too. I mean...if everybody was easy and everybody was all pulling in the same direction,
it wouldn't be as fun and interesting. And it's different and also it
changes from time to time. Sometimes we concentrate on technical problems
and then occasionally, happily fairly seldom, there comes this perfect
storm of social issues that start up, and one flame war perhaps brings out
some other issues that people have had and have been kind of simmering
under the surface....
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Outside this small world it has become fashionable to talk about &ldquo;social
networks&rdquo; and point to Facebook and MySpace, with their millions of users
and zillions of posts, as examples of those. Perhaps they are. But there's
a difference between those and the societies of constructive
problem-solvers who create the infrastructure on which civilization relies.
One welcomes, and even values, noise. The other one doesn't. Which would
you rather build on?
</p><p>
The trick is knowing what goes into what you rely on. With open-source
code, and open development methods&mdash;including discussion among developers
themselves&mdash;you can do that. You can know. Or at least try to know.
</p><p>
At their best, humans are creatures that try to know what's going on. But
humans also aren't perfect. No species is. Life is experimental. Behavior,
like the beings that commit it, is all prototype. So are developments
amidst crystals, weather, geology, stars and galaxies. All is alpha and
beta, and we never get to omega. Nor should we. Getting better is far more
interesting than being perfect. You can build toward the ideal. But you use
what's real.
