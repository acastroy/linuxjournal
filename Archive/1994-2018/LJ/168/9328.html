Cfengine makes it easier to manage configuration files across large
numbers of machines.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2c580.0x20242f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Cfengine is known by many system administrators to be an excellent tool
to automate manual tasks on UNIX and Linux-based machines. It also
is the most comprehensive framework to execute administrative shell scripts
across many servers running disparate operating systems. Although cfengine
is certainly good for these purposes, it also is widely considered the
best open-source tool available for configuration management. Using
cfengine, sysadmins with a large installation of, say, 800 machines, can
have information about their environment quickly that otherwise would take
months to gather, as well as the ability to change the environment in an
instant. For an initial example, if you have a set of Linux machines that
need to have a different /etc/nsswitch.conf, and then have some processes
restarted, there's no need to connect to each machine and perform these
steps or even to write a script and run it on the machines once they
are identified. You simply can tell cfengine that all the Linux machines
running Fedora/Debian/CentOS with XGB of RAM or more need to use a
particular /etc/nsswitch.conf until a newer one is designated. Cfengine
can do all that in a one-line statement.
</p><p>
Cfengine's configuration management capabilities can work in several
different ways. In this article, I focus on a make-it-so-and-keep-it-so
approach. Let's consider a small hosting company configuration, with three
administrators and two data centers (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9328f1.large.jpg"><img src="9328f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. How the Few Control the Many
</p></div></div><p>
Each administrator can use a Subversion/CVS sandbox to hold repositories
for each data center. The cfengine client will run on each client machine,
either through a cron job or a cfengine execution d&aelig;mon, and pull
the cfengine configuration files appropriate for each machine from the
server. If there is work to be done for that particular machine, it will
be carried out and reported to the server. If there are configuration
files to copy, the ones active on the client host will be replaced by
the copies on the cfengine server. (Cfengine will not replace a file if
the copy process is partial or incomplete.)
</p><p>
A cfengine implementation has three major components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Version control: this usually consists of a versioning system, such
as CVS or Subversion.
</p></li><li><p>
Cfengine internal components: cfservd, cfagent, cfexecd, cfenvd,
cfagent.conf and update.conf.
</p></li><li><p>
Cfengine commands: processes, files, shellcommands, groups, editfiles,
copy and so forth.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The cfservd is the master d&aelig;mon, configured with /etc/cfservd.conf, and
it listens on port 5803 for connections to the cfengine server. This
d&aelig;mon controls security and directory access for all client machines
connecting to it. cfagent is the client program for running cfengine
on hosts. It will run either from cron, manually or from the execution
d&aelig;mon for cfengine, cfexecd. A common method for running the cfagent is
to execute it from cron using the cfexecd in non-d&aelig;mon mode. The primary
reason for using both is to engage cfengine's logging system. This is
accomplished using the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*/10 * * * * /var/cfengine/sbin/cfexecd -F 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2c580.0x2024a80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
as a cron entry on Linux (unless Solaris starts to understand
*/10). Note that this is fairly frequent and good only for a
low number of servers. We don't want 800 servers updating within the
same ten minutes.
</p><p>
The cfenvd is the &ldquo;environment d&aelig;mon&rdquo; that runs on the client side
of the cfengine implementation. It gathers information about the host
machine, such as hostname, OS and IP address. The cfenvd detects these
factors about a host and uses them to determine to which groups the machine
belongs. This, in effect, creates a profile for each machine that
cfengine uses to determine what work to perform on each host.
</p><p>
The master configuration file for each host is cfagent.conf. This file
can contain all the configuration information and cfengine code for
the host, a subset of hosts or all hosts in the cfengine network. This
file is often just a starting point where all configurations are stored
in other files and &ldquo;imported&rdquo; into cfagent.conf, in a very
similar fashion to Nagios configuration files. The update.conf file is
the fundamental configuration file for the client. It primarily just
identifies the cfengine server and gets a copy of the cfagent.conf.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9328f2.large.jpg"><img src="9328f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Automated Distribution of Cfengine Files
</p></div></div><p>
The update.conf file tells the cfengine server to deploy a new cfagent.conf
file
(and perhaps other files as well) if the current copy on the host machine
is different. This adds some protection for a scenario where a corrupt
cfagent.conf is sent out or in case there never was one. Although you
could use cfengine to distribute update.conf, it should be copied
manually to each host.
</p><p>
Cfengine &ldquo;commands&rdquo; are not entered on the command line. They make up
the syntax of the cfengine configuration language. Because cfengine is a
framework, the system administrator must write the necessary commands
in cfengine configuration files in order to move and manipulate
data. As
an example, let's take a look at the files command as it would appear
in the cfagent.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
files: 

/etc/passwd mode=644 
    owner=root action=fixall 
/etc/shadow mode=600 
    owner=root action=fixall 
</pre>
</p><p>
This would set all machines' /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files to
the permissions listed in the file (644 and 600). It also would change
the owner of the file to root and fix all of these settings if they
are found to be different, each time cfengine runs. It's important
to keep in mind that there are no group limitations to this particular
files command. If cfengine does not have a group listed for the
command, it assumes you mean any host. This also could be written as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
files:
     any::
            /etc/passwd mode=644
                owner=root action=fixall 
            /etc/shadow mode=600 
                owner=root action=fixall 
</pre>
</p><p>
This brings us to an important topic in building a cfengine
implementation: groups. There is a groups command that can be used to
assign hosts to groups based on various criteria. Custom groups that are
created in this way are called soft groups. The groups that are
filled by the cfenvd d&aelig;mon automatically are referred to as hard
groups. To use the groups feature of cfengine and assign some soft
groups, simply create a groups.cf file, and tell the cfagent.conf to
import it somewhere in the beginning of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import:
      any:: 
            groups.cf
</pre>
</p><p>
Cfengine will look in the default directory for the groups.cf file in
/var/cfengine/inputs. Now you can create arbitrary groups based on any
criteria. It is important to remember that the terms groups and
classes are completely interchangeable in cfengine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
groups:
         development = ( nfs01 nfs02 10.0.0.17 )
         production = ( app01 app02 !development )
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can combine hard groups that have been discovered by cfenvd
with soft groups:

<pre     class="programlisting">
groups:
         legacy = ( irix compiled_on_cygwin sco )
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's get our testing setup in order. First, install cfengine on a
server and a client or workstation. Cfengine has been compiled on almost
everything, so there should be a package for your OS/distribution. Because
the source is usually the latest version, and many versions are bug fixes,
I recommend compiling it yourself. Installing cfengine gives you
both the server and client binaries and utilities on every machine, so
be careful not to run the server d&aelig;mon (cfservd) on a client machine
unless you specifically intend to do that. After the install, you should have a
/var/cfengine/ directory and the binaries mentioned previously.
</p><p>
Before any host can actually communicate with the cfengine server, keys
must be exchanged between the two. Cfengine keys are similar to SSH keys,
except they are one-way. That is to say, both the server and the client
must have each other's public key in order to communicate. Years of
sysadmin paranoia cause me to recommend manually copying all keys and
trusting nothing. Copy /var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub from the
server to all the clients and from the clients to the server in the same
directory, renaming them /var/cfengine/ppkeys/root-10.11.0.1.pub, where
the IP is 10.11.0.1.
</p><p>
On the server side, cfservd.conf must be configured to allow
clients to access particular directories. To do this, create an
AllowConnectionsFrom and an admit section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#cfservd.conf

control:
         AllowConnectionsFrom = ( 192.168.0.0/24 )
admit: 
         /configs/datacenter1 *.example1.com
         /configs/datacenter2 *.example2.com
</pre>
</p><p>
To test your example client to see whether it is connecting to the cfengine
server, make sure port 5803 is clear between them, and run the server with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cfservd -v -d2
</pre>
</p><p>
And, on the client run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cfagent -v --no-splay
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give you a lot of debugging information on the server side to
see what's working and what isn't.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a look at distributing a configuration file. Although
cfengine has a full-featured file editor in the editfiles command,
using this method for distributing configurations is not advised. The
copy command will move a file from the server to the client machine with
.cfnew appended to the filename. Then, once the file has been copied
completely,
it renames the file and saves the old copy as .cfsaved in the
specified directory. Here's the copy command syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">

copy:
     class::
             &lt;&lt;master-file&gt;&gt;
 
                  dest=target-file
                  server=server
                  mode=mode
                  owner=owner
                  group=group
                  backup=true/false
                  repository=backup dir
                  recurse=number/inf/0
                  define=classlist

</pre>
</p><p>
Only the dest= is required, along with the filename to save at the
destination. These can be different. Here's another example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
copy:
      linux::
         ${copydir}/linux/resolv.conf
 
             dest=/etc/resolv.conf
             server=cfengine.example1.com
             mode=644
             owner=root
             group=root
             backup=true
             repository=/var/cfengine/cfbackup
             recurse=0
             define=copiedresolvdotconf
</pre>
</p><p>
The last line in this copy statement assigns this host to a group
called copiedresolvdotconf. Although we don't have to do
anything after copying this particular file, we may want to do some
action on all hosts that just had this file successfully sent to them,
such as sending an e-mail or restarting a process. As another example,
if you update a configuration file that is attached to a d&aelig;mon, you
may want to send a SIGHUP to the process to cause it to reread the
configuration file. This is common with Apache's httpd.conf or 
inetd.conf. If the copy is not successful, this server won't be added to
the copiedresolvdotconf class. You can query all servers in the network
to see whether they are members and, if not, find out what went wrong.
</p><p>
A great way to version control your config files is to use a cfengine
variable for the filename being copied to control which version gets
distributed. Such a line may look something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
copy:
      linux::
          ${copydir}/linux/${resolv_conf} 
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, better yet, you can use cfengine's class-specific variables, whose scope is
limited to the class with which they are associated. This makes copy statements
much more elegant and can simplify changes as your cfengine files scale:

<pre     class="programlisting">
control:

    # ${resolve_conf} value depends on context, 
    # is this a linux machine or hpux?
    linux:: resolve_conf = ( "${copydir}"/linux/resolv.conf )
    hpux:: resolve_conf = ( "${copydir}"/hpux/resolv.conf )
 copy:
       linux::

                ${resolve_conf}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is a full cfagent.conf file that makes use of everything I've covered
thus far. It also adds some practical examples of how to do
sysadmin work with cfengine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cfagent.conf

control:
       actionsequence = ( files editfiles processes )
       AddInstallable = ( cron_restart )
     solaris:: crontab = ( /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root )
     linux:: crontab = ( /var/spool/cron/root )

files:
       solaris::
         ${crontab}
                      action=touch
      linux::
         ${crontab}
                      action=touch

editfiles:
      solaris::
           { ${crontab}
           AppendIfNoSuchLine "0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * 
           &#8618;/var/cfengine/sbin/cfexecd -F"
           DefineClasses "cron_restart"
      }
     linux::
          { ${crontab}
          AppendIfNoSuchLine "0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * 
          &#8618;/var/cfengine/sbin/cfexecd -F"
       #linux doesn't need a cron restart.
         }

shellcommands:
       solaris.cron_restart::
            "/etc/init.d/cron stop"
            "/etc/init.d/cron start"

import:
        any::
                 groups.cf
                 copy.cf
</pre>
</p><p>
The above is a full cfagent configuration that adds cfengine execution
from cron to each client (if it's Linux or Solaris). So effectively,
once you run cfengine manually for the first time with this cfagent.conf
file, cfengine will continue to run every five minutes from that host,
but you won't need to edit or restart cron. The control section
of the cfagent.conf is where you can define some variables that will
control how cfengine handles the configuration file.
<tt  >actionsequence</tt>
tells cfengine what order to execute each command, and
<tt  >AddInstallable</tt> is
a variable that holds soft groups that get defined later in the file in a
&ldquo;define&rdquo; statement, such as after the editfiles command where the line
is <tt  >DefineClasses "cron_restart"</tt>. The reason for
using AddInstallable
is sometimes cfengine skips over groups that are defined after
command execution, and defining that group in the control section ensures
that the command will be recognized throughout the configuration.
</p><p>
Being able to check configuration files out from a versioning system
and distribute them to a set of servers is a powerful system
administration tool. A number of independent tools will
do a subset of cfengine's work (such as rsync, ssh and make), but nothing else
allows a small group of system administrators to manage such a large
group of servers. Centralizing configuration management has the dual
benefit of information and control, and cfengine provides
these benefits in a free, open-source tool for your infrastructure and
application environments.
