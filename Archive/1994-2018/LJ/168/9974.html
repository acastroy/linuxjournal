The future of backups is here, but unfortunately, there aren't any
Delorians.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd8c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Backups in today's environment are in a state of flux. Tapes have
been the mainstay of most organizations for years&mdash;and in some cases,
decades. However, as the cost of hard drives decreases and their capacity
increases, conventional wisdom about backups and tapes is changing.
Although
tapes still prove useful for archiving and offsite storage, inexpensive
disk-based technology slowly is creeping into areas that tape has
traditionally dominated.
</p><p>
Many enterprises find it's just as easy and reliable to back up data over
their network to near-line storage, such as a Storage Area Network (SAN)
or Network-Attached Storage (NAS), instead of tape. Also sometimes referred
to as disk-to-disk (D2D) backups, the benefits of near-line storage are
many&mdash;especially speed and capacity. When deciding to
go near line, you really have only two choices: SAN or NAS. Of
the two, NAS is more cost-practical for most shops. In this article,
I explain how to implement a near-line backup to a NAS to illustrate how easy it
is to begin the transition from tapes to disks.
</p><p>
I've chosen two programs for reaching the goal of a tapeless backup:
FreeNAS (to create a networked storage area for backup files)
and Bacula (to automate backups and provide a pseudo-daily, weekly and
monthly rotation). 
</p><p>
To keep things simple, let's build two systems, one running FreeNAS and
one running Bacula on top of Fedora 8. All configuration done on the
Bacula system for this article was performed as root, but 
it also could be done with sudo. Bear in mind, the options covered in both
programs here represent only a handful of their full capabilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd8c558"></a>
FreeNAS</h2></div></div><p>
FreeNAS is one of the simplest programs I have ever deployed. It's small
enough to run a system from a CD or USB key. However, for this example,
let's install it on our server 
to the local hard disk. On your system, I suggest at least
256MB of memory and SATA drives for decent performance. If you want to
use RAID on your drives, use hardware-based solutions. They are faster,
and there have been issues with the built-in software RAID capabilities
of FreeNAS. If you opt to use hardware RAID, check the FreeBSD hardware
compatibility list, on which FreeNAS is based, before making a purchase.
</p><p>
Download the latest ISO from the FreeNAS site, and burn it to CD (version
.684b at the time of this writing). Boot the system from CD, and when you come to
the options menu (Figure 1), select option 7 to install the server image to a
local hard disk. Next, select option 2 to create two UFS partitions. UFS
is the native filesystem in FreeNAS, and as we plan to access our
data on the disk via a networked protocol (NFS), any system should connect
to it. Select these options to create a small partition for the server
software, and use the rest of the space for a second data partition. When
prompted, enter the name of the CD drive (acd0 in my install), and then
enter the destination drive (da0). When the install routine is complete,
enter 3 at the prompt to return to the main menu, and then enter 1 to assign
an interface. Accept the default interface, and give it an IP address
(unless you are using DHCP). Once assigned, return to the main menu, and
reboot the machine. Remove the CD, and the system now should boot from
the system partition on the disk.

Figure 1. FreeNAS Install Options
</p></div></div><p>
Once the system is back up, open a Web browser from another system, and
enter the IP of the FreeNAS machine as the URL to access the management
site. At the prompt, enter admin as the user name and
freenas as
the password. From this management site, you can change a multitude of
settings, but for now, we need to change only our hostname (Figure 2), mount the
auto-created DATA partition and enable NFS.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9974f2.large.jpg"><img src="9974f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Setting the Hostname on the FreeNAS Management Page
</p></div></div><p>
Click the Management link under the Disks section of the Web page. You
should see a message saying that you need to add your hard drive to the disk
list. Click the + icon to add it (Figure 3). Leave all the options at their 
defaults, except PreFormatted FS. Set this to UFS, as FreeNAS 
already has done the work for us. Once you click the Apply Changes button,
the status column of your disk will change to ONLINE.

</p></div></div><p>
Now click the Mount Point link, and click the + icon again on this
page to edit the Mount Point properties (Figure 4). From this screen,
change the partition to 2, as partition 1 is the system partition, which
cannot be used. Leave the File System as UFS, and enter DATA as the share
name. Click Add when finished. This takes you back to the original Mount
Point page. Click Apply Changes.

Under the Services links, click NFS. Check the Enable box to turn
NFS on, and type your network address range in CIDR notation. Click the
Save button, and your NAS build is complete.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd8cf50"></a>
Bacula</h2></div></div><p>
With the FreeNAS system in place, let's start building the Bacula
system. The test system used here was built on Fedora 8 (Werewolf) with
GNOME, because it includes Bacula and its dependencies in its core RPM
library. To add the necessary packages and related dependencies, all you
need to do is use the Add/Remove Software utility under the Applications
menu. When ready, install the following packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
bacula-client
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-common
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-console
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-gnome
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-console-gnome
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-console-wxwidgets
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-director-common
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-director-mysql
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-docs
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-storage-common
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-storage-mysql
</p></li><li><p>
bacula-traymonitor
</p></li><li><p>
mysql
</p></li></ul></div><p>
When the installs are complete, start mysqld, and set it to
start runlevel 5 from the Services utility in GNOME or use chkconfig. If
you're using a different distribution, you need to use the
Bacula source files and make/configure the install to get to
the next step. This can be more challenging than using an RPM, because
of the numerous command-line install options available.
</p><p>
Next, open a terminal to create the MySQL tables needed for Bacula to
operate. Run the following scripts created by the Bacula RPM:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/alternatives/create_bacula_databases 
/etc/alternatives /make_bacula_tables
/etc/alternatives /grant_bacula_privileges
</pre>
</p><p>
After setting up the database, create a local mountpoint (like
/mnt/freenas), and mount the FreeNAS share created previously. An easy
way to do this on every startup is to add the following line to your
/etc/fstab file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
FreeNASServerHostName:/mnt/DATA   /mnt/freenas   nfs   defaults	0 0
</pre>
</p><p>
To mount the partition immediately, type <tt  >mount -a</tt>.
</p><p>
Before moving on to editing Bacula's configuration files, here's
how Bacula works. The Bacula program is composed of
three separate d&aelig;mons: the director, the storage d&aelig;mon and the
file d&aelig;mon. The director is the boss. It's the main server d&aelig;mon
that defines jobs, pools, schedules and most of the important settings
related to backups. As such, the majority of setup
deals with its configuration file /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf. The storage
d&aelig;mon
(SD) controls the media written to by Bacula, usually either tapes or
disks. These items are configured in the bacula-sd.conf file. The file
d&aelig;mon (FD), also referred to as the client, runs locally on any system
you want to back up. Two other related utilities used here are the GNOME
console (gnome-console.conf) and the tray-monitor (tray-monitor.conf)
utility.
</p><p>
With this basic knowledge of Bacula's interoperation, open your
/etc/bacula/bacual-dir.conf file, and add the following lines (for brevity,
I have added only those sections used in our scenario):

<pre     class="programlisting">
JobDefs {
  Name="UserHomes" Type=Backup Client = bacula-fd FileSet =
  "UserHomeFolders" Storage = File Messages = Daemon
}

Job {
  Name = "WeeklyHomeBackups"
  JobDefs = "UserHomes"
  Level = Full
  Schedule = WeeklyFullandDiffs
  Pool = Weekly
  Priority = 10
  Write Bootstrap = "/var/spool/bacula/WeeklyHomeBackups.bsr"
  
}

Job {
  Name = "MonthlyHomeBackups"
  JobDefs = "UserHomes"
  Level = Full
  Schedule = MonthlyFull
  Pool = Monthly
  Priority = 10
  Write Bootstrap = "/var/spool/bacula/MonthlyHomeBackups.bsr"
  
}

Schedule {
  Name = "WeeklyFullandDiffs"
  Run = Level=Full Pool=Weekly sun at 3:00
  Run = Level=Differential Pool=Diffs mon-fri at 3:00
}

Schedule {
  Name = "MonthlyFull"
  Run = Level=Full Pool=Monthly 1st sat at 3:00
}

FileSet {
  Name = "UserHomeFolders"
  Include {
    Options {
      compression=GZIP
      signature = MD5
    }
    File = /home
  }
}

Pool {
  Name = Weekly
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes                       
  AutoPrune = yes                     
  Volume Retention = 6 days       
  Maximum Volumes = 5
  Label Format = Bkup-Full
  
}

Pool {
  Name = Diffs
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes 
  AutoPrune = yes           
  Volume Retention = 23 hours 
  Maximum Volumes = 1
  Label Format = Bkup-Diff
}

Pool {
  Name = Monthly
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes
  AutoPrune = yes
  Volume Retention = 364 days 
  Maximum Volumes = 12
  Label Format = Bkup-Monthly
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Although it may seem odd to start at the bottom and discuss the
Pool section, it is vital that it is configured correctly. A pool is
simply a collection of volumes. Volumes are tapes or disks to which the
backup files are written. A pool can contain any number of volumes,
but it must have at least one volume. Here, we have set up three pools:
a weekly full, a differential and a monthly. This allows us 
to maintain backups for the current week up until the previous day and
a 12-month rotation for our monthly backups.
</p><p>
Then, going from the top section down, there is a Job Definitions
(JobDefs) section, and two Jobs modeled around our backup strategy. The
JobDefs section defines common properties that several jobs share, like a
template. In it, we have listed settings common to both jobs. The Schedule
section defines when a given job runs and how often. The schedules listed
here run weekly backups every Sunday, daily differentials Monday through Friday
and a monthly backup the first Saturday of every month. The Fileset
section lists what folders and files to back up and with what options. For
this example, we have set Bacula to back up the local users' home folders,
a common scenario for backups. Recursion is enabled by default on FileSets,
so we need to specify only the parent folder. The backup files also
are set to compress using gzip and to hash/encrypt themselves using MD5. Doing
both is good practice.
</p><p>
Before saving and closing the file, go through and change any instance of
@@Password@@ or like entries to a common password. Rather than cover how
each Bacula d&aelig;mon authenticates with the other, it's easier simply
to change all of them to the same password for the time being and get the
system up and running. You can change these passwords later
if desired. Change any other password-related fields in the following
files to the common password as well: bacula-sd.conf, bacula-fd.conf,
bconsole.conf, gnome-console.conf and tray-monitor.conf. After changing
the passwords, you also need to change any references to your host in all
the .conf files, so each d&aelig;mon can communicate with each other. If
all of the d&aelig;mons run locally, you can use localhost. You also could use
an FQDN or IP address. The field you want to edit is listed under
each section as Address. So, for example, change the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Address = server.example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd84758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Address = localhost  
</pre>
</p><p>
You also could search for the client.example.com and
storage.example.com entries to find some of the other entries that need to
be changed. Once the passwords and Address fields have been set, open
the /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf file in your editor, and comment the following
line in the Device section of the Filestorage device:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Archive Device = /tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, add the line below in its place to associate the locally mounted
FreeNAS partition with the storage d&aelig;mon so you can back up to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Archive Device = /mnt/freenas
</pre>
</p><p>
The final step is to open the Services utility under System&rarr;Administration, and check the box to set bacula-dir, bacula-sd and
bacula-fd to start on runlevel 5 (Figure 5). You now can use the syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service bacula-dir|sd|fd start|stop|restart 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd84ac8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to control the d&aelig;mons. On
other distributions, you can start the d&aelig;mons directly from /usr/sbin
and use chkconfig to set the runlevel.

Running a Backup Job</h2></div></div><p>
Running a backup is quite simple, as you already have done most of the
work by editing the bacula-dir.conf file. Start the Bacula console
from the Applications&rarr;System Tools Menu (Figure 6) in GNOME. You
may need to edit the launcher, as I did, to point it to the correct
/etc/bacula/gnome-console.conf file. Start the Tray Monitor utility
from the System Tools menu as well. The Tray Monitor (Figure 7) is nice,
because it gives you a quick glance at the status of the d&aelig;mons and
any running jobs. This is helpful when you are multitasking or have
jobs that run nightly and you want to check their status the next
morning. Return to the console, and click the Run button to bring
up the backup job dialog window. Under job, select WeeklyHomeBackups
(Figure 8). This pre-fills the field selections with the items specified
in your .conf file. You could change any of these options at this point,
but they must first exist in the .conf file or they will not appear
in the fields. In other words, you can't create a job from the
drop-downs without populating the Job section of the .conf file. 
</p><p>
Up to this point, there are no volumes, which as previously mentioned, need
to exist before you can run a backup. Typically, you would have to use
the label command from the console's command line to create a
volume in a pool manually, but because of our settings, the system will create them
automatically, auto-name them and recycle them when the volume retention
period triggers. I like this better than manually creating the volumes,
as you are less likely to encounter naming errors. Click OK to run the
job, and view the results in the console.

Figure 8. Running a Backup Job from the GNOME Console
</p></div></div><p>
If you were to change the Volume Retention setting on the same pool,
restart the d&aelig;mons and run the job again, you would see the system
auto-recycle a volume in the pool for the next job. Otherwise, it will prompt
you to create a new volume, as no existing volumes can be recycled
due to retention settings. You can run these jobs manually as often as
you want, but they also will run according to the schedule defined in the
bacula-dir.conf file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc94580.0xd854c0"></a>
Restoring a File</h2></div></div><p>
Restoring a file in Bacula also is remarkably
simple. You can use
either the Restore button on the console toolbar or the restore command. Both are
easy to use, but the restore command provides more options. To keep
it simple, let's use the Restore button. When the dialog opens, select a
job, client, pool and so on from which to restore (Figure 9), then click Select Files
to mark the files/folders you want to restore (Figure 10). Before the restore
job runs, you will be prompted to confirm your options, at which point you
could type <tt  >yes</tt>, <tt  >mod</tt> or
<tt  >no</tt>. Typing <tt  >mod</tt> provides more
options over the job,
including the option to restore to a different path from the original one.

The Beginning of the Future</h2></div></div><p>
Although we have simplified the near-line backup process here, it's
only the beginning. Our simple setup has accomplished what we set out to
do: back up our data to a networked disk. To replace tapes completely in most
backup strategies, you need some sort of offsite storage/synchronization
scheme, which I've not addressed here. However, once you see much
faster backups and how much more data you can store on a disk,
you'll be itching to make the move and get rid of those tapes.
