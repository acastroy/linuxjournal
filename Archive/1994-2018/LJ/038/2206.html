    This article provides insight
    for creating a full-fledged, web-based database application under
    Linux, using David Hughes' mSQL package and standard Unix tools.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x25513a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the past few years, many companies
have realized the benefits of using Linux to serve web content to
the masses. The power of a freely available, feature-laden 32-bit
operating system, coupled with a vast number of utilities and
development tools, provides a cost-effective solution for
implementing enterprise and publicly-available information servers.
</p><p>While many organizations have championed Linux as a web
server, few have taken advantage of perhaps one of the most
interesting aspects of the Web: <span   class="emphasis"><em>dynamic content
generation and delivery</em></span>. Think about it. Of all the web
sites you visit on a regular basis, how many of them have static
content? Not many. Many us go to Yahoo! each day to see &ldquo;What's
New on the Internet&rdquo;. Many cruise over to catch the news on CNN
throughout the day. These sites have dynamic content. If the
listings on Yahoo! didn't change every day, how many of us would go
back after the first visit?</p><p>To provide dynamic content to your cyberguests, you can use a
variety of tools and methods. One of the more popular approaches is
to integrate data repositories with the Web. Creating web-based
applications that integrate with existing database pools seems to
be the rage this year. This paradigm has led to some amazing
third-party products such as Bluestone Software's Sapphire/Web
(http://www.bluestone.com/) and Haht Software's HahtSite
(http://www.haht.com/). These products provide full development
environments for designing, creating and deploying web-based
applications. Unfortunately, the majority of these products are not
yet available for Linux (iBSC options ignored for the moment).
However, there is an alternative.</p><p>You can retrofit a Linux-based web server to provide access
to enterprise data in a very cost-effective manner. Third-party
packages typically have an integrated development environment (IDE)
to provide for seamless, somewhat painless development. This can be
easily replaced by your favorite text/HTML editor. Third-party
packages typically interface nicely with expensive, proprietary
database platforms such as Oracle, Sybase and Informix. These
database systems cost thousands of dollars, and generally require a
seasoned database administrator (DBA) to operate efficiently. In
our Linux model, we will employ David Hughes' mSQL engine, which
costs a whopping $170 USD, and is a breeze to use. To fully
implement such an approach, expect to spend no less than $10,000 on
the software alone. The Linux/mSQL approach (including the cost of
a Linux CD-ROM distribution, the mSQL engine and coffee) should
cost around $250. Senior management has always had a love affair
with saving money&mdash;show them the numbers. It sells itself,
folks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2551608"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>In this article, the following assumptions are made:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>You have a working, fully installed Linux
server.</p></li><li><p>You have a functional HTTP server running (NCSA,
CERN, Apache, etc.).</p></li><li><p>You have installed either BASH, pdksh or
ksh93.</p></li><li><p>You have the standard Unix tools in place (awk,
sed, Perl, etc.).</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2551a28"></a>Obtaining the mSQL Package</h2></div></div><p>The first item you need is the mSQL (mini Structured Query
Language) engine itself. The mSQL package implements a relatively
fast, lightweight database engine that uses a subset of the ANSI
SQL standard to perform its operations. As of this writing, the
current stable release is version 1.0.16, although the long awaited
v2.0 release has been promised soon. It can be obtained via ftp at
ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/. The official home of mSQL is
at http://Hughes.com.au/.</p><p>Next, you need the <b  >w3-msql</b> package, also
written and distributed by David Hughes. This package provides the
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) interface to the databases managed
by mSQL. As of this writing, the current version of
<b  >w3-msql</b> is version 1.0, although 2.0 is in the
works. It is available via ftp at
ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/w3-msql/.</p><p>Finally, the example scripts presented in this article are
available via ftp at ftp://www.dcicorp.com/pub/unix/msqlweb/.
Unless you are a typing enthusiast and are already familiar with
mSQL, I recommend you snag the examples.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2551c90"></a>Installation and Compilation</h2></div></div><p>Once you have obtained the distribution archive, move it to
either a scratch directory or the base of your normal source tree.
You can extract the package as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gzip -d msql-1.0.16.tar.gz
tar xf msql-1.0.16.tar
</pre><p>To prepare for compilation, switch to the
<b  >./msql-1.0.16</b> directory and execute the
following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make target
cd targets/Linux*
 ./setup
</pre>


You will be asked the following questions pertaining to the actual
build of the package. Here are a few notes to guide you:
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Top of install tree?</b></span> While
mSQL can be installed virtually anywhere on your system, you should
use the default path, /usr/local/Minerva. It makes installing
third-party add-ons easier.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Will this installation be running as
root?</b></span> This question is concerned primarily with the TCP
port mSQL uses for network communication. If your distribution is
running as root, the default TCP port is 1112; otherwise port 4333
is used. You can tailor these defaults in the
<b  >./common/site.h</b> header file. Also, take a look
at the mSQL FAQ, available at the mSQL web site, which describes a
number of other scenarios this setting affects.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Directory for PID file?</b></span>
Where do you keep your PID files? The default is
<b  >/var/adm</b>, which is fine for most folks.</p><p>At this point, the script will finish its tailoring process.
Before you actually compile the package, you can perform several
customizations by editing a few of the source files. The first,
<b  >./common/site.h</b>, contains such gems as selecting
the German language over English for error reporting. Give it a
quick glance and make sure you are comfortable with the settings.
Another possible modification lies in the
<b  >./msql/msql_priv.h</b> file. I like to bolster my
database limits a bit. At the top of this file are several values
you can alter to suit your needs, including the maximum number of
fields returned in a query, maximum number of network connections
allowed, and the maximum length for field and table names. Feel
free to modify these as you see fit. For the non-adventurous, the
defaults should suffice.</p><p>To compile the package, simply execute the following command
from the base source directory
(<b  >./targets/Linux*</b>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make all
</pre><p>Compilation on a Pentium-class machine generally takes a
little over a minute. If there are no compiler errors, you can
install the package by executing the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre>


The system is installed in /usr/local/Minerva (or whatever you set
the install directory to when you ran <b  >setup</b>).
</p><p>Compiling and installing the <b  >w3-msql</b>
utility is much simpler. After you obtain the distribution archive,
extract it into your source or scratch directory as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gzip -d w3-msql-1.0.tar.gz
tar xf w3-msql-1.0.tar
</pre><p>Change into the <b  >w3-msql-1.0</b> directory, and
remove the <b  >-lsocket -lnls</b> assignment to the
<b  >make</b> variable <b  >LIBS</b>. Linux
does not require these libraries to be linked into the application.
Run <b  >make</b>, and you are in business. If the build
was successful, simply copy the <b  >w3-msql</b> binary
image over to your web server's cgi-bin directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2552840"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>The mSQL server process needs to be invoked during your
machine's startup procedure. Place a line similar to the following
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msqld&amp;
</pre><p>For testing purposes, and to save you a reboot, execute the
above command from the shell prompt. This gets the server process
up and running, ready to handle your database requests.
</p><p>To make sure your mSQL server has been installed properly,
several test scripts are supplied with the mSQL distribution
archive. Finally, make sure you take the time to look over the mSQL
documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2552a50"></a>Setting up mSQL for Use with the Web
Project</h2></div></div><p>As part of this article, a fully functional web-based
database application is presented in its entirety. The purpose is
to provide a framework for your own web endeavors, as well as to
show off the ease with which you can construct these types of
applications using standard Unix tools.</p><p>Our example focuses on the creation and interaction of a
database to contain concert listings that contains several items of
information for each concert. First, we concentrate on populating
the database with a series of concert listings, then build some
web-based queries.</p><p>Before we create the database schema itself, we need to
determine the functional elements of the application. What
information needs to be stored in the database? What types of
queries will be offered to our web guests? Do we need the ability
to allow additional concert entries to be added through the
Web?</p><p>Our database stores the concert date, opening act, headlining
act, location and ticket price. For now, we concentrate on simple
queries such as looking up concerts by band name and location. We
also assume the &ldquo;add&rdquo; page is either protected by HTTPD
authentication or made available through an Intranet.</p><p>The following is the mSQL schema we used to create the
concerts database:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table notices (
        show_date               char(10),
        headliner               char(30),
        opening_act     char(30),
        location                char(30),
        ticket_price    char(10)
        )
</pre><p>To create the sample database and load it with initial data,
execute the <b  >mkconcerts</b> script located in the
examples archive. For those of you who don't have ftp access, the
data are shown in Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="2206l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. mkconcerts
Script</a></p><p>To verify that the data have been loaded properly, execute
the <b  >mkreport</b> script (see
<a href="2206l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. mkreport Script</a>), which
is also in the examples archive. This script simply dumps the
contents of the database into a formatted table, called
concert.listings, shown in <a href="2206l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3.concert.listings File</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2459580.0x2549860"></a>Web-Based Interaction with w3-msql</h2></div></div><p>Now that the database is created and populated with test
data, it's time to begin constructing HTML pages that interact with
the database. (Keep in mind that this article is intended to
supplement but not replace the documentation that ships with mSQL
and w3-msql.)</p><p>w3-msql acts as an HTML &ldquo;preprocesser&rdquo; of sorts. It takes a
standard HTML document and performs database actions based on
embedded mSQL primitives as shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2206f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Process Flow
</p></div></div><p>As a first example, consider the HTML document named
ex1.html, shown in <a href="2206l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. HTML
Document with Embedded mSQL Commands</a>, which demonstrates a
simple link to a document containing embedded mSQL commands.</p><p>Note the calling procedure. The document name is placed
immediately after the invocation to w3-msql (PATH_INFO). w3-msql
takes this document, looks for any embedded mSQL commands and sends
the appropriate output to the client. In this case, we are
requesting the <b  >query1.html</b> document, which
contains the HTML shown in <a href="2206l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. HTML
Document</a>. When selected, the output of the w3-msql link is
shown in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2206f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Output of ex1.html/query1.html
</p></div></div><p>While the previous example is rudimentary, it demonstrates
the ease of presenting information from an mSQL database. Let's
continue with this example by expanding our queries. One nice
feature to implement is the ability to produce a listing sorted by
a specific field. Consider the following rewrite of our ex1.html
file, which adds several hypertext links, each sorted on a
different field. The file, called ex2.html, is shown in Listing
6.</p><p><a href="2206l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. HTML
Document</a></p><p>Note the addition of the <b  >?sortby=??????</b>
parameters. We create new variables, make an initial assignment,
and pass that, along with the document name (now called
query2.html), to w3-msql. We use the <b  >sortby</b>
variable to contain a field name on which we wish to sort the
listing.</p><p>Now that we have coded the skeleton for the front end, what
changes are needed to the actual query template? Consider the
rewrite of query.html, now appropriately called query2.html, shown
in Listing 7.</p><p><a href="2206l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7. HTML Document
query2.html</a></p><p>The only major change is in the mSQL
<b  >select</b> statement. We added the standard ANSI SQL
<b  >order by</b> clause, passing along the content of
our new <b  >sortby</b> variable. In addition, note the
use of the mSQL <b  >print</b> command to display the
sort field name in the header above the table. A
<b  >sortby</b> location displays the HTML table shown in
Figure 3.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2206f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Concert Data Sorted by Location
</p></div></div><p>To finish our simple query example let's revisit the concept
of searching by location. Let's allow the user to input a city name
manually, and pass it along to w3-msql for querying. Consider the
simple HTML document, called ex3.html, shown in Listing 8. It
provides an input field in a form, linked to w3-msql as the form
processor.</p><p><a href="2206l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8. HTML Document
ex3.html</a></p><p>The query3.html document, which handles the actual
query-by-city is shown in Listing 9. Note the change in the mSQL
<b  >select</b> statement. We use the contents of the
form field in the ex3.html document as the value of a where-like
SQL clause.</p><p><a href="2206l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9. HTML Document
query3.html</a></p><p>To test this form, enter <b  >New York</b> as the
city name&mdash;Figure 4 shows the output.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2206f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Form-based Query Results
</p></div></div><p>That about sums it up for performing simple queries to a mSQL
database. Try experimenting with different tables and interface
designs. Try using frames. Place a search form in one frame and the
query results in another. The possibilities are endless with the
Linux/mSQL approach.</p></div></div>
