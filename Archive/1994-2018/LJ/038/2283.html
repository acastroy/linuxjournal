UniForum'97 was very satisfying as I got to see two great
luminaries of our time&mdash;the Hale-Bopp comet and Linus Torvalds.
Hale-Bopp was visible in the pre-dawn sky on March 12 and 13. Linus
was visible at the Keynote speech on March 13 and was definitely
the brighter of the two.
</p><p>The president of UniForum, Tom Mace, was present to welcome
Linus, and Douglas Michaels of SCO presented Linus with UniForum's
Achievement Award. The award itself is a clear, pyramid-shaped
trophy, about which Linus said he was pleased to have something
&ldquo;physical&rdquo; to show for his work. Linus' acceptance speech was brief
and self-effacing as usual. He referred to himself as the &ldquo;spider
at the center of the web&rdquo; with many others working around him. Tove
and their 3 month old baby girl, Patricia Miranda, had accompanied
Linus and both tolerated my pushiness in taking pictures. After the
keynote, Linus and Tove made the rounds of the Exhibit Hall,
visiting all their fans in the Linux Pavilion. Tove confided that
they were enjoying the weather (no snow), but that the arrival of
their furniture had been delayed by a bad storm that had forced the
ship back to Germany.</p><p>Mitchell Kertzman of Sybase gave a vibrant keynote speech
that morning, in which he ignored Linux as a possible factor in a
paradigm shift that might topple Microsoft. Perhaps he hasn't heard
that Linus' goal is &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;. Kertzman compared today's
software industry to the automobile industry of the fifties&mdash;that
it is designing products to be obsolete in three years, while
consumers are wanting long term reliability. Sounds to me like
consumers are looking for Linux.</p><p>While 7000 people had pre-registered for UniForum, only about
75% of those actually attended. Perhaps the others went to one of
the competing shows such as Internet World. At any rate, at times
the floor was crowded with attendees, while at other times
(particularly toward the end of the day) it was quite empty. The
Linux Pavilion was placed in the right rear corner of the floor,
yet it seemed to me that most attendees were gravitating over to
check out this upstart operating system that dares to be freely
available. SSC gave away their stock of magazines and bumper
stickers, as well as displaying T-shirts, reference cards and the
new &ldquo;Tux&rdquo; mugs. IBM and Lucent Technologies both had central
positions on the floor, but I saw many people passing them by to
visit Digital to check out both the Alpha and Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall's
new Linux setup for Digital's Intel box. Jon is providing us with a
short article about this setup that will appear next month.</p><p>I attended two of the talks: one on Electronic Document
Interchange and one on high speed Internet access. Both were well
presented and full of good information. I was particularly
impressed with Jeff Wilbur's thoughts on the directions that access
to the Internet will take in the future (i.e., cable modems, xDSL,
satellite, ISDN), and so asked him for an article.</p><p>Since UniForum '97 was my first conference as Editor of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I met many people I had only
heard about before, including Joel Goldberg of InfoMagic (who is a
sponsor of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>), Mark Bolzern of
WGS, Adam Richter of Yggdrasil, and of course, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall of
Digital. Jon introduced me to Ted Cook of BRU, who told me of his
plan to give away BRU software to Linux User Groups at the upcoming
Linux Expo and to groups that are members of G.L.U.E.
(http://www.ssc.com/glue/).</p><p>On Wednesday night Joanne Wagner, one of our advertising
representatives, and I attended a press conference/party put on by
XiGraphics&mdash;free food and drink, always a plus. The press
conference was held to announce the recent name change (from X
Inside) and the latest release of Xi's Accelerated X software. The
president and founder of the company, Thomas Roell, gave a short
presentation in which he described the directions he envisions for
Xi Graphics.</p><p>All in all, I had a good time at the conference and a
pleasant stay in San Francisco.</p></div></div>
