    Communicating from the office to home using a Linux server and the
    Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1a3b3f8"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>Recently I got the urge to tinker with managing my network at
home in order to get some experience with Unix and heterogeneous
network management. I have three Windows boxes (two with Windows 95
and one with Windows 3.1) hooked up to a Linux server. I use the
LinTel box as both a local file server and as a gateway linking my
home network to the Internet.</p><p>The software I use to handle the file server tasks is SAMBA.
My primary reference for setting up SAMBA was the excellent article
on the subject in the July, 1996 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>In picking a dial-up program, I kept two requirements in
mind:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>I didn't want to manually log on to my ISP each
time I wanted access to the Internet.</p></li><li><p>I didn't want my LinTel box to call up my ISP on
startup and then remain connected until I shut it down. I wanted to
be considerate of my ISP's other clients by not monopolizing a
phone line.</p></li></ol></div><p>A program written by Eric Schenk, called
<b  >diald</b>, satisfied both these requirements. I use
<b  >diald</b> to connect to my ISP whenever I have
traffic destined for the Internet. It also automatically
disconnects from my ISP if there is no traffic for a specified
interval.</p><p>I work for various companies with access to the Net, and
while at work, I like to access my home Linux server through the
Net from time to time&mdash;just in case I find something neat during a
lunch break that I want to tinker with at home. So I set up my
server to connect to the Net at various random intervals between 15
and 60 minutes, loiter around for five minutes and disconnect if
there is no traffic. While my server is connected I can download
anything I wish. I call this process ghosting.</p><p>These are the steps I went through to get ghosting to work.
Depending on whether you already have Linux installed and what
flavor it is, you may be able to skip some steps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1a3b978"></a>Linux Installation</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I did was acquire Red Hat 4.0 from Red Hat
Software, http://www.redhat.com/. I had heard good things about Red
Hat and liked their &ldquo;Red Hat Package Manager&rdquo; for handling
software bug fixes and upgrades&mdash;it sure makes life easier. I
installed Red Hat by following the directions given during the
install process.</p><p>Next, I downloaded the latest version of the kernel available
at that time, 2.0.29, from <b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b>, and
configured my new kernel using hardware specific settings.</p><p>Another necessity for ghosting is IP masquerading. I found
three good sources of information on IP masquerading:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The most definitive is the IP-Masquerading Resource
home page at http://www.wwonline.com/~achau/ipmasq/.</p></li><li><p>The IP-Masquerading Mini-HOWTO, probably available
at your favorite Linux site on the Net.</p></li><li><p>The last is the IP masquerading article in the
July, 1996 Issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I
downloaded the latest IP masquerading patch for kernel 2.0.28 and
higher from the IP-Masquerading Resource home page, and it worked
fine with my 2.0.29 kernel. Again, all I had to do was follow the
instructions to reconfigure the kernel using the <b  >make
menuconfig</b> method. Here are the pertinent settings for IP
masquerading to work:</p></li><li><p>Under <b  >Code Maturity Level
Options</b>, turn on &ldquo;Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers&rdquo;. (The IP masquerading code is still
considered alpha code.)</p></li><li><p>Under <b  >Networking Options</b>, turn
on &ldquo;Network firewalls&rdquo;, &ldquo;Network aliasing&rdquo;, &ldquo;TCP/IP
networking&rdquo;, &ldquo;IP forwarding/gatewaying&rdquo;, &ldquo;IP multicasting&rdquo;,
&ldquo;IP firewalling&rdquo;, &ldquo;IP accounting&rdquo;, &ldquo;IP masquerading
(EXPERIMENTAL)&rdquo; and &ldquo;IP tunneling&rdquo;.</p></li></ol></div><p>After configuring the rest of the kernel, I just continued
following instructions to build it. I recommend doing a
<b  >make zdisk</b> and making sure the system boots fine
from floppy before doing a <b  >make zlilo</b>. That way
the old kernel doesn't get accidently blown away. My
<b  >make</b> procedure is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make dep
make config
make -j5 zdisk
make -j5 modules
make modules_install
</pre><p>I then reboot from the floppy and keep an eye on the startup
information. With a successful reboot, go back into the Linux
source directory and do a <b  >make zlilo</b>. The
<b  >-j5</b> switch causes <b  >make</b> to
spawn up to five compiles simultaneously. This method of
compilation speeds up the build process tremendously.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1a3c3c8"></a>Setting Up the PPP Daemon</h2></div></div><p>After installing Red Hat I set up the point-to-point protocol
daemon (pppd); this allows my Linux server to communicate with the
Internet. The ppp daemon came with the Red Hat package, and
installs automatically when a networking package is
selected.</p><p>First, I set up a configuration file named /etc/ppp/options,
then created a chat script to tell the ppp daemon how to
communicate with my ISP. The configuration file I used looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modem
/dev/cua0
38400
asyncmap 0
defaultroute
</pre><p>The man page for the ppp daemon explains these lines in
detail. The default configuration file that comes with Red Hat
should suit your purposes. The only line to be concerned about is
<b  >/dev/cua0</b>&mdash;this line tells the ppp daemon where
to find your modem.
</p><p>Before <b  >pppd</b> can be used to communicate to
the Internet, you have to dial and connect to your ISP. This
usually involves a process called handshaking, implemented by a
program called chat. A chat script sends the chat program the
instructions for logging into your ISP. A chat script is basically
a series of <b  >wait</b> and <b  >send</b>
strings. Red Hat provides a network configuration tool that runs
under X-Windows and can be used to create and test chat scripts. I
had a chat script called /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-ppp0
(see Listing 1[footnote]). I symbolically linked this script into
my /etc/ppp subdirectory using the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /etc/ppp
ln -s /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-ppp0
</pre><p>You will need to modify my chat script by changing the phone
number, username and password responses to match your own. You may
also need to modify the line <b  >ppp default</b>
depending on the requirements of your ISP&mdash;contact your ISP for
that information.
</p><p><a href="2095l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Chat
Script</a></p><p>Now, there are some things I want the system to do right
after a successful connect to, or disconnect from, the Internet.
Fortunately, pppd has a couple of features that make this easy.
When the ppp link comes up, the daemon checks for the existence of
a script called <b  >/etc/ppp/ip-up</b>. If this script
exists, ppp daemon invokes it with the specified connection
parameters. My version of this script appears in Listing 2&mdash;notice
the comments at the top of the script indicate the parameters
<b  >pppd</b> passes to the script.</p><p><a href="2095l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. /etc/ppp/ip-up
Script</a></p><p>When the ppp link goes down, the ppp daemon checks for the
existence of a file called <b  >/etc/ppp/ip-down</b>. If
this file exists, it is invoked when the ppp link is terminated.
The contents of my script are shown in Listing 3. This script
mainly does some cleanup&mdash;undoing what I did in the
<b  >ip-up</b> script.</p><p><a href="2095l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. /etc/ppp/ip-down
Script</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1a3ccb8"></a>Setting up the Dialer Daemon</h2></div></div><p>Next, I acquired and set up the dialer daemon,
<b  >diald</b>. This handy-dandy piece of software waits
until it sees an IP packet destined for the Internet and, if the
ppp connection is not up, automatically starts the ppp daemon,
which then connects to the Internet.</p><p>This package can be obtained from
http://www.dna.lth.se/~erics/diald.html. A word of caution&mdash;the
latest version of <b  >diald</b> is 0.16. I am using
0.14. I've tried 0.15, but it had problems reconnecting once I
terminated a connection. I have not had time to test out version
0.16. Version 0.14 works just fine for me. If you are interested in
upgrading to the latest and greatest <b  >diald</b>, send
me e-mail, and I'll let you know if it works now. I should have it
tested by the time this article is published. Just follow the
included instructions to build and install
<b  >diald</b>.</p><p><a href="2095l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4: /etc/ppp/diald-up
Script</a></p><p>Once I installed <b  >diald</b>, I created some
scripts to bring it up and down easily. The script to bring it up
is called <b  >/etc/ppp/diald-up</b> and appears in
Listing 4 with plenty of comments.</p><p>Since this script is somewhat obscure, I will cover it in
more detail. The <b  >route</b> command is used to tell
the network software how to get from your computer to other
computers and networks. Normally there is a default route the
network software uses when it can't find another suitable route in
the routing table. To view your routing table, use the
<b  >netstat -rn</b> command. For more information see
the <b  >netstat</b> man page.</p><p>The first command in Listing 4 removes the default route in
order to make sure it is free for <b  >diald</b> or the
ppp daemon to use. This removal is necessary, since sometimes
<b  >diald</b> and ppp won't re-assign the default route
if one is already assigned.</p><p>The second command starts the dialer daemon. (For more
details refer to the <b  >diald</b> man page.) To use
this line in your script, you will need to change three
items:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>the communications device
<b  >/dev/cua0</b></p></li><li><p>the local address
<b  >10.10.10.1</b></p></li><li><p>the remote address
<b  >192.168.1.2</b></p></li></ol></div><p>If you have a fixed IP address, you'll also need to remove
the <b  >dynamic</b> switch line from the script.</p><p>The third, fourth and fifth commands are used to set up the
firewall. These commands have to be run after the dialer daemon,
because it does the masquerading from the network out to the
Internet via the default route. Whenever a packet needs to leave
via the default route, the dialer daemon senses it and makes a
connection to the Internet using the ppp daemon.</p><p>I also have a script to shut down the dialer daemon
gracefully. I call it <b  >/etc/ppp/diald-down</b> and
the source appears in Listing 5.</p><p><a href="2095l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5:
/etc/ppp/diald-down</a></p><p>The dialer daemon can be communicated with using a named pipe
specified on the <b  >diald</b> command line in the
<b  >diald-up</b> script. I use the recommended name
<b  >/etc/diald.fifo</b>. This named pipe allows you to
change various parameters of the program while it is running and to
gracefully exit the program without resorting to the
<b  >kill</b> command.</p><p>The first command in Listing 5 tells the dialer daemon to
clean up and get out. The second command resets the default route
back to the Ethernet card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1e35e80"></a>Testing the Dialer Daemon</h2></div></div><p>To test the <b  >diald</b> script, execute
<b  >tail -f /var/log/messages</b> in one virtual
console, and in another type <b  >ping 192.9.9.1</b> to
ping sun.com. After typing the <b  >ping</b> command, you
can toggle back over to the first console and watch
<b  >diald</b> spit out status messages. These status
messages tell you if <b  >diald</b> dials your modem and
activates <b  >pppd</b> correctly. If ppp appears to
connect properly, you can toggle back over to the other console and
see if the ping is returned. If not, don't panic&mdash;just break out of
it using a Ctrl-C and try again. Sometimes packets get dropped when
<b  >diald</b> is switching the route from the slip
interface to the ppp interface.</p><p>I used the IP address in the above commands on the assumption
that you do not have a name server running on your machine. If you
are interested in getting a name server up and running on your
machine&mdash;something I recommend&mdash;a couple of good sources of
information are the DNS HOWTO and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network
Administrators Guide</em></span> by Olaf Kirch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1e362f8"></a>Create an Appear Script</h2></div></div><p>Next I created an <b  >appear</b> script. The
<b  >appear</b> script causes <b  >diald</b> to
connect to the Internet, then sends an indication of where the
server can be reached to the desired location. I created a script
called <b  >/etc/ppp/appear</b> to do the work. This
script appears in Listing 6.</p><p><a href="2095l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6: /etc/ppp/appear
Script</a></p><p>Last, I added an entry to the <b  >/etc/crontab</b>
file. This file is used by the <b  >cron</b> daemon to
determine what to run when. (For more information on
<b  >cron</b> take a gander at the
<b  >cron</b> man page.) This is the line I added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
30 07 * * 1-5 root /etc/ppp/appear
</pre><p>This entry tells the cron daemon to start your
<b  >appear</b> script Monday through Friday at 7:30 AM.
The <b  >appear</b> script needs to be started this way
only once per day; it will then restart itself whenever the time is
right.
</p><p>After completing all these steps, I was set up to ghost on
and off the Internet, and if you've been following these steps, you
will be ready too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1e36980"></a>A Note about Windows 95 Configuration</h2></div></div><p>If you decide, as I did, to hook up some WinTel boxes to your
Linux server, here are some hints to get it up and running.</p><p>In the following examples, I am assuming your personal
network is on the 192.168.1.* subnet, the Linux server is at
192.168.1.1 and your Win95 machine is at IP address
192.168.1.2.</p><p>Select the network icon in your Win95 Control panel. Then
select the TCP/IP -&gt; <span   class="emphasis"><em>network card</em></span> entry in
the list. Click on properties, so that the properties window will
appear, and do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Under the <b  >IP Address</b> tab, select
&ldquo;Specify an IP address&rdquo;, and enter 192.168.1.2 in the IP Address
field, also enter 255.255.255.0 in the &ldquo;Subnet Mask&rdquo;
field.</p></li><li><p>Under the <b  >Gateway</b> tab enter
192.168.1.1 in the &ldquo;New gateway&rdquo; field, and click the
<b  >Add</b> button. This tells Windows that the Linux
server is the gateway.</p></li><li><p>Under the <b  >DNS Configuration</b> tab
select &ldquo;Enable DNS&rdquo;, and enter the host name for your machine in
the &ldquo;Host field&rdquo;. Then enter the domain you use for your internal
network.</p></li><li><p>If you have the DNS name server running on your
Linux server, enter 192.168.1.1 in the &ldquo;DNS Server Search Order&rdquo;
field and click <b  >Add</b>. If you are going to use
your ISP's name server, enter your ISP's name server IP address in
this field instead.</p></li><li><p>In the &ldquo;Domain Suffix Search Order&rdquo; field, you
can re-enter your internal domain and click the
<b  >Add</b> button.</p></li><li><p>Last, click on the <b  >Okay</b> button.
Windows will reboot and you will be set to go.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1943580.0x1d48e50"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This setup has worked quite well for me. Every morning before
I go to work I decide whether I want to be able to access my box
from the office through the Internet. If I do, I just turn it on,
and at 7:30 AM cron starts the <b  >appear</b> script,
and I'm off to the races.
</p><p>There are some security issues to be aware of&mdash;once your
server is on the Net, anyone can access it. To prevent people from
being able to <b  >telnet</b> to your server from
anywhere, add the following line to your /etc/hosts.deny
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ALL: ALL
</pre><p>This entry denies access to your box from everywhere&mdash;it is a
good default. Now add the following entry to your /etc/hosts.allow
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ALL: LOCAL myisp.net mywork.com
</pre><p>
This entry allows you to connect only from systems on your local
network, your ISP and your place of work. (For more information
about these files, see the man page for hosts.allow.)
