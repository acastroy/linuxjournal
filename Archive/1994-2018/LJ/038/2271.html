    Readers sound off.

much. It's always a thrill getting those first copies of a
published work.</p><p>I am very disappointed on one count, though. My e-mail
address was removed from the short bio at the end (page 72). All my
esteemed fellow authors included their e-mail addresses, so I
assume it was an unconscious mistake on some editor's part. (Not to
excuse it; careless mistakes are the most preventable and least
forgivable variety in my book.)</p><p>Funny thing is, I'm decidedly unimpressed with authors who
avoid interaction with their readers. They abdicate the stewardship
of knowledge their work otherwise earned them. Now I'm
involuntarily guilty of this very sin. The main reason I write
articles is to try to make contact with forms of intelligent and
enlightened life out there. I missed my chance this time. I guess
my lesson for the next time is to insist on a review copy.</p><p>In all other respects, it's been a real pleasure working with
you folks. Mary Webber, by the way, is wonderful. &mdash;Bob
Stein bobstein@earthlink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a82f0"></a>Polygon Code</h2></div></div><p>Much to my surprise, I found that in the article &ldquo;A Point
About Polygons&rdquo; by Bob Stein in the March 1997 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, the code in Listing 2
(TESTPOLY.C) was specifically written for Turbo C and the DOS
environment. As it was apparently coded back in 1995, one may
assume that Stein has since discovered a more mature development
platform, but I do hope this is not to be taken as a subtle shift
of focus on the part of the editors of
<i  >LJ</i>. &mdash;Robert V. Schipper rvs@gol.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a84a8"></a>Author Responds</h2></div></div><p>Thanks for writing, Robert.</p><p>You're quite right, TESTPOLY.C was for the Borland/DOS
environment. At Galacticomm we've been using Borland's command line
development environment for some time, and we continue to do so for
both the DOS and NT versions of Worldgroup. So at the time, it was
convenient, taking me only an hour or two to use.</p><p>If you're hoping I've seen the light and started using Linux
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you. Lately I've been using Microsoft's
Visual C++ and Sun's Java for graphics programming. I assume my
article was accepted for its Websmithing theme [Yes, that's
why&mdash;Ed.]. &mdash;Bob Stein bobstein@earthlink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a8660"></a>No Dialtone on Modem</h2></div></div><p>I was reading the article titled &ldquo;Setting Up UUCP&rdquo; in issue
35, and noticed the author was wondering why his modem dials when
there is no dial tone. I have discovered over the years that some
modems return:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NO DIALTONE
</pre><p>while others return:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NO DIAL TONE
</pre><p>So, including a line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chat-fail NO\sDIAL\sTONE
</pre><p>
would probably solve his problem. &mdash;Scott

to you guys about my company (the second time was actually about a
dozen copies of the same e-mail, sent every week or so until I
finally got a reply), you still got it wrong. My company is
MostlyLinux, but my entry in the <span   class="emphasis"><em><i>Linux Journal</i> 1997
Buyer's Guide</em></span> lists me as &ldquo;Calgary UNIX Users Group&rdquo;,
with my phone numbers, but with their snail-mail address instead of
mine, and my e-mail address through them rather than through my own
company.</p><p>This is going to cause confusion both for myself and the
Group (with whom I volunteer, and on whose behalf I have dealt with
SSC, which may have caused confusion on your part). I remain a
loyal reader of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (which I find
very useful), but am very unhappy that I am going to have to deal
with the problems this creates. For future reference, if you intend
to publish another <span   class="emphasis"><em>Buyer's Guide</em></span>, please note
that I am: &mdash;Scott Barker MostlyLinux, Inc. Voice Mail:

Buyer's Guide</em></span>. I feel this type of effort is very good
for the industry. Craftwork Solutions is focused on making Linux an
accepted commercial solution for businesses. We are glad to see SSC
make the effort to explain to the general public the benefits of
using Linux.</p><p>What did trouble me came at the end of the issue. Craftwork
Solutions announced back in Sept/Oct '96 our 2.2 release for both
the Intel and Alpha architectures. We were across the aisle from
SSC at Comdex in November '96, showing our 2.2 releases.
Unfortunately, your table included only the out-of-date information
on our 2.0 product.</p><p>You made room for both the 3.0 and 4.0 releases of Red Hat. I
would have expected that at least our 2.2 information would have
been used! Craftwork Solutions has advertised with
<i  >LJ</i> since 1995. I would very much like to
understand how this oversight occurred.</p><p>Your publishing of our old data makes us look like a company
that is not concerned about the direction of the industry and not
interested in providing the best product and support to its
customers. I personally take that very hard. My staff worked long
weeks during the summer to have the new releases ready for
Comdex.</p><p>I realize the information we filled out for you back in May
'96, reflected the 2.0 product. What confuses me is that the Red
Hat 4.0 wasn't available back in May '96 either. Please explain to
me how this mixup occurred, and how we can prevent it from
occurring in the future. &mdash;Lee Morse, Chief Technology
Officer lmorse@craftwork.com Craftwork Solutions, Inc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a8fa8"></a>Data is Our Life</h2></div></div><p>This was our first buyer's guide and we made some mistakes,
but we learned from them and plan to have an even better issue next
time. One of the things we are most concerned about is data
gathering methods. For this issue, other than the sunsite listings,
we printed only what was sent to us. If you did not send in updated
information, we would not have updated it for you. Red Hat
obviously did send in updated information. If you did send in
updated information, then I apologize for the table not getting
updated. Actually, in either case, I apologize. Next time, we'll
include a check for the latest distributions in our procedure. We
do know what the current distributions are.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a90b0"></a>File Locking Services</h2></div></div><p>Mr. Kraft's comments in the March 1997 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, regarding Linux's lack of
network file locking services, are dead on the mark; however, I
would now like to make it publicly known that there is an ongoing
development effort to provide a lockd and statd for Linux.</p><p>This effort is currently combined with an effort, led by Olaf
Kirch, to revise major portions of the Linux NFS implementation. A
kernel-space lockd, written by Olaf, and a user-space statd,
initially written by me and then significantly modified by Olaf,
are currently part of Olaf's NFS development distribution
&ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;.</p><p>A developers' mailing list exists for people who wish to
contribute to, or participate in the alpha/beta testing of, this
development effort. The list address is lockd-statd@linux.nrao.edu,
and the list's subscription address is majordomo@linux.nrao.edu.
Current snapshots of the linux-nfs development code can be
retrieved from the following anonymous FTP directories:</p><p>ftp.mathematik.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/linux/okir/dontuse/
linux.nrao.edu:/pub/people/linux/okir/dontuse/</p><p>There are currently plans to publish an introduction to
network file locking, together with a description of the Linux
implementation, in an upcoming issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In addition, I will be giving a short
presentation on this subject at the April 1997 Linux Expo in
Raleigh, North Carolina. &mdash;Jeff Uphoff juphoff@nrao.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a93c8"></a>Security Issues</h2></div></div><p>If you are going to do a security article, get it right.
People get cgi and suid programs wrong on their own without your
printing an article that contains serious errors. A good article on
cgi security would have been just what is needed. Unfortunately
this wasn't it.</p><p>Let's take this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
exit(system("/home/foo/www/bin/counter.sh"));
</pre><p>If I run this handy provided example by doing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd HACKDIR
cp /bin/hash ./home
ln -s suidxi&mdash;program ./foo
IFS='/'
export IFS
 ./foo
</pre>


I get a shell as the person it is <b  >setuid</b> to.
</p><p>Why? Because the system runs the command through the shell,
and the shell uses IFS as its &ldquo;white space&rdquo; definition.</p><p>This is basic setuid security stuff.</p><p>The procmail-based example at least does use a magic cookie
to stop fake mails. It has other bugs; notably, it forgets sendmail
may deliver multiple mails in parallel using data, but then I guess
it makes it plain it's just trying to show the trick, not do it
right. &mdash;Alan Cox alan@cymru.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b0580.0x11a9790"></a>On-Line Linux Users Group</h2></div></div><p>Hi. I have been a longtime reader of <i  >LJ</i>
and it has been a great help to me, and I am sure that applies to
many in the Linux Community! Now, my friends on the Net and I have
also done something as a contribution to Linux which I thought
would be interesting to you and helpful to your readers. We have
created an On-Line Linux Users Group for people interested in
learning more about Linux, providing help to other Linuxers, and
promoting Linux:</p><p>http://www.linuxware.com/ &mdash;Peter
