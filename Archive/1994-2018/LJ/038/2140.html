    Some handy tools for managing today's ubiquitous networks.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x18ab4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In today's world, where all the computing
revolves around the concept of networking, the work for system
administrators has become more and more overwhelming. It is the
mission of maintaining the availability of resources such as
routers, hubs, servers and every critical device in the network.
</p><p>There are many reasons managers would like to monitor network
devices: bandwidth utilization, operational state of links,
bottlenecks, problems with the cabling or routing information
distributed between its devices, etc. Monitoring network activity
is also a good starting point for discovering security problems and
misbehaviors.</p><p>In many cases, the network of an organization includes
expensive links to remote networks (WAN) or the Internet, whose
costs may be based on traffic volume. It's very important to
maintain statistics of traffic going through these links. This is a
very common task in Europe, where X.25 links are still very common.
These links are charged on the basis of packets transmitted and
received.</p><p>Other types of links, like Point to Point or Frame Relay, are
usually charged on a flat rate. In these, the telco ensures a
bandwidth that is important to monitor.</p><p>In the final part of this article we focus on a tool designed
to monitor traffic in router interfaces, with a great graphical
representation of this information. It can be easily modified to
monitor other kinds of information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x18ab710"></a>What's SNMP?</h2></div></div><p>The answer to all these needs is a protocol named Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Designed in the '80s, SNMP's
initial aim was to integrate the management of different types of
networks with a simple design that caused very little stress on the
network.</p><p>SNMP operates at the application level using TCP/IP
transport-level protocols so it can ignore the underlying network
hardware. This means the management software uses IP, and so can
control devices on any connected network&mdash;not just those attached
to its physical network. This also has disadvantages: if the IP
routing is not working correctly between two devices, it's
impossible to reach the target to monitor or reconfigure it.</p><p>There are two main elements in the SNMP architecture: the
agent and the manager. It's a client-server architecture, where the
agent is the server and the manager is the client.</p><p>The agent is a program running in each of the monitored or
managed nodes of the network. It provides an interface to all the
items of their configuration. These items are stored in a data
structure called a management information base (MIB), which we
explain later. It's the server side, as long as it maintains the
information being managed and waits for commands from the
client.</p><p>The manager is the software that runs in the monitoring
station of the network, and its role is contacting the different
agents running in the network to poll for values of its internal
data. It's the client side of the communication.</p><p>There is a special command in the SNMP command set called
<b  >trap</b> that permits an agent to send unsolicited
data to the manager, to inform it of events, such as errors,
shutdowns, etc.</p><p>In essence, SNMP is a very simple protocol as long as all the
operations it performs deal with the fetch-and-store paradigm, and
this allows for a small commands set. A manager can perform only
two different operations on an agent: request or set the value of a
variable in the MIB of the agent. These two operations are known as
get-request and set-request. There's a command to respond to a
get-request called get-response, which is used only by the
agent.</p><p>The extensibility of the protocol is directly related to the
capability of the MIB to store new items. If a manufacturer wants
to add some new commands to a device such as a router, he must add
the appropriate variables to its database (MIB).</p><p>Almost all manufacturers implement versions of SNMP agents in
their devices&mdash;routers, hubs, operating systems, and so on. Linux
is not an exception to this, and publicly available SNMP agents for
Linux can be found on the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x18abb30"></a>Dealing with Security</h2></div></div><p>SNMP provides very little support for authentication schemes.
It supports only a two-password scheme. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> allows managers to request the values
of variables, and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>private</em></span> allows these
values to be set. These passwords in SNMP are called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>communities</em></span>. Every device connected to an
SNMP-managed network must have these two communities configured. It
is very common to have the public community set to &ldquo;public&rdquo; and
the private community to &ldquo;private&rdquo;, but it's very important to
change these values to reflect the security policy of your
organization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x18abd40"></a>What's the MIB?</h2></div></div><p>SNMP defines a separate standard for the data managed by the
protocol. This standard defines the data maintained by a device in
the network and what operations are allowed on it. The data is
structured in a tree form, and there is a unique path to reach each
variable. This structured tree is called the Management Information
Base (MIB) and is documented in several RFCs.</p><p>The current version of the TCP/IP MIB is MIB-II and is
defined in RFC-1213. It divides the information a TCP/IP device
should maintain into eight categories (shown in Table 1), and each
variable included in this information must fall in one of
them.</p><p><a href="2140t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>The MIB definition of a particular item also specifies the
data type it can contain. Usually, items of an MIB can store single
integers, but they can also contain strings or more complex
structures, like tables. Items in an MIB are called objects.
Objects are the leaf nodes of the MIB tree, but an object can have
more than one instance&mdash;for example, a table object. To refer to
the value contained in an object, you must add the number of the
instance. When only one instance exists for an object, this is the
<b  >0</b> instance.</p><p>For example, the object <b  >ifNumber</b> from
category &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; contains an integer with the number of
interfaces present in this device, but the object
<b  >ipRoutingTable</b> from category &ldquo;ip&rdquo; contains the
routing table of the device.</p><p>Remember to use the number of the instance to retrieve the
value for an object. In this case, the number of interfaces present
in a router can be viewed with the instance
<b  >ifNumber.0</b>.</p><p>In the case of a table object, you must use the index of the
table as the last number to indicate a specific instance (row of
the table).</p><p>There is another standard by which to define and identify MIB
variables, called Structure of Management Information (SMI). SMI
specifies MIB variables must be declared in an ISO formal language
called ASN.1 that makes the form and contents of these variables
unambiguous.</p><p>The ISO name space is within a global name space with other
trees for other standards organizations. Within the ISO name space
there is a specific tree for the MIB information. Within that MIB
part of the tree are areas for objects from all protocols and
applications so their information can be represented
unambiguously.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the TCP/IP MIB name space is located just down
the mgmt name space of the IAB. The hierarchy also specifies a
number for each of the levels.</p><p><a href="2140f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. TCP/IP Organizational
Tree</a></p><p>It's important to notice that most of the software needs the
leading dot (root) to locate the object in the MIB. If you don't
include the leading dot, it assumes a relative path from
.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.</p><p>This way the object <b  >ifNumber</b> from category
&ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; can be named:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces.ifnumber
</pre><p>or its numerical equivalent:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1
</pre>


and the instance as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mibxi-2.interfaces.ifnumber.0
</pre>


or its numerical equivalent:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0
</pre>


Additional MIBs can be added to this tree as vendors create them
and publish the suitable RFCs.

developed. It addresses the lack of security of the actual protocol
with mechanisms that focus on privacy, authentication and access
control. It also allows more complex specification of variables and
has some additional commands. The problem with SNMPv2 is it still
is not a commonly accepted standard, unlike SNMPv1. It is not easy
to find SNMPv2 versions of the agents and software to take
advantage of the new commands. Let's see what happens in the near
future...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x18ac790"></a>SNMP with Linux</h2></div></div><p>One of the most popular SNMP packages is CMU-SNMP. Originally
designed by Carnegie Mellon University, it has been ported to Linux
by Juergen Schoenwaelder and Erik Schoenfelder. It's fully
compliant with the SNMPv1 standard and includes some of the new
proposed functionalities of SNMPv2.</p><p>The distribution contains some manager tools that permit, in
a command line style, send requests to devices running SNMP agents.
It also contains an SNMP agent program, designed to run under
Linux, that provides managers running on the network (or the same
system) information about the status of the interfaces, routing
table, uptime, contact information, etc.</p><p>One very valuable add-on that comes with CMU-SNMP is a SNMP
C-API, which lets programmers build more complex management tools
based on the networking capabilities of the distribution.</p><p>The installation on a Linux system is easy, but a little
different from the original CMU distribution. The distribution
comes with precompiled binary versions of the manager tools, the
daemon and the API library.</p><p>First of all, you must decide whether to get the binary or
the source distribution. It's easy to locate the package on the
Internet (check the resources sidebar). The binary distribution
runs cleanly with the 2.0 kernel series and is ELF-based. We will
explain how to install the binary distribution. It's a good
practice to get binary distributions only from trusted sites to
avoid viruses, Trojan-horse style attacks and other security
problems.</p><p>Put the file cmu-snmp-linux-3.2-bin.tar.gz in the root
directory (/) of your Linux system and decompress it with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gunzip cmu-snmp-linux-3.2-bin.tar.gz
</pre><p>Then, untar the distribution to its final location with the
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvf cmu-snmp-linux-3.2-bin.tar
</pre>


Now you will have all the utilities and libraries properly
installed on your system, except the SNMP agent configuration file
/etc/snmpd.conf. You can create it by running the script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 /tmp/cmu-snmp-linux-3.2/etc/installconf
</pre>


with these options:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/tmp/cmu-snmp-linux-3.2/etc/installconf -mini &lt;password&gt;
</pre>


where <b  >password</b> is the public community you want
to use. Now you can edit the newly installed configuration file
/etc/snmpd.conf. In it, you can change the values for the UDP port
used by the agent, the systemContact, systemLocation and systemName
variables and the interface speed parameters for your network cards
and PPP ports.
</p><p>The most important management tools you get are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmpget</b></span> A
tool designed to ask for a concrete value in the MIB of an agent in
the network (a router, a hub, etc.)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmpgetnext</b></span>
It allows you to get the next object in an MIB tree without knowing
its name.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmpset</b></span> A
tool to set values in remote agents</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmpwalk</b></span>
Tool that requests a complete object or series of objects without
having to specify the exact instance. It's useful for requesting
table objects.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmpnetstat</b></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmptrapd</b></span>
Daemon that listens for traps sent by agents</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>/usr/bin/snmptest</b></span>
Interactive tool designed to demonstrate the capacities of the
API.</p></li></ul></div><p>The agent is located in the /usr/sbin/snmpd directory.</p><p>CMU-SNMP also installs an MIB file in /usr/lib/mib.txt. It's
a good reference to search for information we can request from a
device.</p><p>The agent must be run at startup time, and can be set up with
this line in one of your system boot files (/etc/rc.d/rc.local, for
example):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/snmpd -f ; \
        echo 'starting snmpd'
</pre><p>Once you have the SNMP agent running for your Linux box, you
can test it with one of the management tools, entering:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/snmpget -v 1 localhost \
        public interfaces.ifNumber.0
</pre>


which will return the number of network interfaces configured in
the system, and:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/snmpwalk -v 1 localhost \
         public system
</pre>


will return all the values in the system subtree of the MIB. (See
<a href="2140f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> for the output of this
command.)
</p><p>The C-API is located in /lib/libsnmp.so.3.1.</p><p>You can check the related header files as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/usr/include/snmp/snmp.h</p></li><li><p>/usr/include/snmp/snmp_impl.h</p></li><li><p>/usr/include/snmp/asn1.h</p></li><li><p>/usr/include/snmp/snmp_api.h</p></li></ul></div><p>and more information in the man pages snmp_api(3) and
variables(5).</p><p>There's also a Perl extension module to interface with the
CMU C-API that easily integrates calls to this library in Perl
scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x1ca5dd0"></a>MRTG: Multi Router Traffic Grapher</h2></div></div><p>MRTG is an advanced tool written by Tobias Oetiker and Dave
Rand to graphically represent the data SNMP agents brings to SNMP
managers. It generates nice HTML pages with GIF graphics about
inbound and outbound traffic in network interfaces in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> real time. This abstracts the idea of
dealing directly with objects of an MIB with a command line tool
like CMU-SNMP. This is the simplest and most powerful tool to
monitor my routers I have found on the Internet.</p><p>MRTG uses an SNMP implementation coded entirely in Perl, so
there is no need to install other packages. The main program is
written in C to speed up the logging process and the generation of
GIF images. The graphics are generated with the help of the GD
library from Thomas Boutell, author of the WWW FAQ.</p><p>One of the highlights of MRTG is its expandability and
powerful configuration. It's very easy to monitor any SNMP
variables instead of traffic, like error packets, system load,
modem availability and others. It's even possible to import data
from an external program to feed the data, so you can use it to
monitor login sessions and other information not available through
SNMP.</p><p>It comes with some tools to watch your router for interfaces,
extract their characteristics and generate a base configuration
file you can easily tweak to accommodate your needs.</p><p>Another interesting feature of MRTG is the amount of
information it generates. It permits four levels of detail for each
interface: traffic in the last 24 hours, the last week, the last
month and a yearly graphic. This allows you to gather information
for statistical purposes. It maintains an accumulated database with
all this information with the help of a consolidation algorithm
that prevents the data in the logs from eating up your disk
space.</p><p>It also generates a main page that contains the GIF images of
the daily details of every interface of a router, which lets you
have a complete idea of what's happening in your router with a
simple look. You can see the main page and a detail page generated
by MRTG in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p><a href="2140f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4. Interface Detail
Page</a></p><p>Let's see a basic installation procedure. First of all, you
need the distribution of MRTG. At the time of this writing, the
latest version was 2.1; check the URL in the references sidebar for
the latest version.</p><p>A package you must install before compiling MRTG is the GD
graphic library. The URL is in the references sidebar, too. The
current version of GD is 1.2, and you shouldn't have any problems
compiling and installing it. Simply run <b  >make</b> in
the directory you unpacked the distribution and a file called
libgd.a will be generated. Copy this file to /usr/local/lib and all
the .h files to the directory /usr/local/include/gd.</p><p>At this point you should have GD up and running. Now is the
time to build the MRTG package. Unpack the distribution, and edit
the Makefile, indicating where to find the GD libraries and header
files, and the Perl 5.003 binary&mdash;usually /usr/bin/perl or
/usr/local/bin/perl. This is done through the variables
<b  >GD_LIB</b>, <b  >GD_INCLUDE</b> and
<b  >PERL</b>.</p><p>Build the main program by typing <b  >make
rateup</b>, and when the compilation finished, enter
<b  >make substitute</b> to include the correct PATH to
the Perl interpreter within the set of Perl scripts that MRTG
uses.</p><p>Copy the following files to the final destination of the
binaries (for example, /usr/local/mrtg): BER.pm, SNMP_Session.pm,
mrtg and rateup. You can also copy to this location the two
configuration programs, indexmaker and cfgmaker.</p><p>Ensure that all the programs have the execution bit set. Now
we're ready to build a simple configuration file. At this point you
should have SNMP read access to your router. In a Cisco router, the
configuration lines to allow this are the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
access-list 99 permit 193.147.0.8
access-list 99 permit 193.147.0.9
access-list 99 permit 193.147.0.130
snmp-server community public RO 99
</pre><p>This allows read-only requests from the addresses specified
in the access list 99 using &ldquo;public&rdquo; as a password (community).
If you want to allow every node in the network Read Only (RO)
access to the router, you can have a line like this one:
<pre     class="programlisting">
snmp-server community public RO
</pre>


If you have another brand of router, check the manuals to determine
how to allow SNMP access to them.
</p><p>The <b  >cfgmaker</b> script greatly simplifies the
task of building the configuration file. All you have to do is run
it with the following arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cfgmaker &lt;community&gt;@&lt;router-host-name or IP&gt;
</pre><p>For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cfgmaker public@mec-router.rediris.es &gt; mrtg.cfg
</pre>


It will discover every interface in your router and write a section
in the file with its specifications of numbers of interfaces,
maximum speed, description, etc, with some HTML tags to include
them in the detail page. It's possible to edit this HTML layout to
suit your language, preferences, etc. You can see in
<a href="2140f5.html" target="_self">Figure 5</a> the output for one of the
interfaces of my router.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x1ca68d0"></a>Router Interface Output Tree</h2></div></div><p>Now you can run the <b  >mrtg</b> program for the
very first time. Simple execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./mrtg mrtg.cfg
</pre><p>If all goes well, it will contact your router, request some
values, and generate some log files and several GIFs in the current
directory. Don't worry about the complaints about the log and
graphs not found, as this will happen only the first time. Remove
the graphs and run the program again. The graph generated shows the
traffic in the interval since you last ran the program. It also
generates HTML pages for each interface.
</p><p>Now it's time to instruct MRTG to run properly in your
system. First, create a directory under the Document Root of your
web server (assuming you run a web server on the same system) to
accommodate the pages and graphs MRTG will generate each time it
runs. Add this directory to the top of your configuration file with
the directive WorkDir: /usr/local/web/mrtg (assuming that your
Document Root is located in /usr/local/web). The next time MRTG
runs, it will create the logs and graphs in this directory,
allowing you to access them via
http://your_host.domain/mrtg.</p><p><a href="2140f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3. Interface Main
Page</a></p><p>Now, you would like to build a main page for all the
interfaces like the one shown in Figure 3. This can't be
accomplished with the indexmaker tool. Run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
indexmaker mrtg.cfg &lt;router-name regexp&gt;  &gt;
        /usr/local/web/mrtg/index.html
</pre><p>It will generate an HTML page with the daily graphs of
interfaces whose router name matches the previous regular
expression and links to their single detail pages.
</p><p>As you can imagine the MRTG program must be run on a regular
basis to collect the data for each interval and generate the graphs
periodically, in order to maintain the illusion of real-time
monitoring. This is done through the following line in the crontab
(assuming /usr/local/mrtg-bin as the mrtg program final
destination):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *  \
        /usr/local/mrtg-bin/mrtg \
        /usr/local/mrtg-bin/mrtg.cfg  &gt; \
        /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>In a Red Hat distribution, the correct line to append to the
/etc/crontab file would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *  root \
       /usr/local/mrtg-bin/mrtg \
       /usr/local/mrtg-bin/mrtg.cfg  &gt;\
       /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;$
</pre>


If everything is working fine, you can spend some time tuning your
configuration and HTML index page. A good enhancement is to include
in the &lt;HEAD&gt; section of the index page a &lt;META .....&gt;
to force the browser to reload every 300 seconds to maintain the
latest information on the screen.
</p><p>Another enhancement you can include in your configuration
file is the WriteExpire directive, which forces MRTG to create
.meta files for each GIF and HTML page, eliminating unnecessary
caching time by proxy servers and browsers. For this to work, you
must also configure your Apache server (assuming you run the Apache
web server) to read these .meta files and send the correct
&ldquo;Expire&rdquo; headers with the <b  >MetaDir</b> directive in
the XXXX file.</p><p>You can look for additional directives in the example
configuration from the distribution; it's very well documented.
It's possible to alter all the layout of the images and pages
generated by MRTG.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this program. If you do, send the authors a
postcard; you can find their address on the MRTG home page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x1ca6fb0"></a>Other programs</h2></div></div><p>There is a similar program called Router-Stats, written by
Iain Lea, the author of the well-known tin news reader.
Router-Stats updates its graphics once a day and shows very
interesting stats about hourly usage and other aspects. One problem
with Router-Stats is it uses a lot of external programs to do its
work (CMU-SNMP for SNMP tasks, GNUPLOT to draw the graphics, NetPBM
to make some graphic conversions, and GIFTOOL to convert them to
the final GIFs). You can check the URL for Router-Stats in the
references sidebar.</p><p>There is another category of software that goes one step
beyond in network management tasks and offers a complete solution
for both monitoring and maintaining the distinct configuration of a
whole network. This kind of solution permits us to draw a complex
graphic representation of our network and browse through the nodes,
checking specific items of the configuration and other interesting
features.</p><p>At this level, we can talk about two commercial solutions
broadly used: HP-OpenView from Hewlett-Packard and SunNet Manager
from Sun. They provide a complete platform for managing all the
resources of the network from great graphical interfaces. They also
come with network discovery tools to find all the network's
elements that have running SNMP agents and databases to store all
the data gathered from the network for statistical purposes. One
important feature of these environments is their ability to be
integrated with other vendors' more specific products, like Cisco's
CiscoWorks, that allows a network manager to maintain a database
with all its router configuration and even monitor graphically the
back panels of their routers and all their connections.</p><p>There are two drawbacks to these products: they are
commercial and they have no ports to Linux. Of course, there are
also public domain solutions for these tasks. One of the best
packages I've found for this is Scotty. Scotty is a TCL-based
package that allows you to implement site-specific network
management software using high-level, string-based APIs. Its
companion product, Tkined, is a network editor that provides
extensions to build a complete framework, integrating some tools
designed to discover IP networks, support the network layout
process or troubleshoot IP networks using SNMP in combination with
other standard tools (e.g., traceroute). Scotty also includes a
graphical MIB browser to allow you to explore MIB
information.</p><p>You can check the references listing for both commercial and
public domain network management software pointers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b3580.0x1bb7b28"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>SNMP is a simple but powerful protocol that can help us
monitor our resources with little stress to the network. It's
possible the extensions being developed now will increase the
complexity and capabilities of this tool but they will also
increase the resources needed to implement them.</p><p>In this article, we have explored a couple of tools found on
the Net. There are a lot of tools being developed each day. You can
check the Usenet newsgroup comp.protocols.snmp for announcements of
new software and MIBS.</p><p><a href="2140s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
