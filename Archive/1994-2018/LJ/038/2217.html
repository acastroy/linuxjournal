between your Linux box and a XENIX system? I have. Unfortunately,
XENIX doesn't support TCP/IP without additional software. The tar
and compress commands are crippled. I eventually found a
precompiled copy of Kermit, but there were hundreds of files to
transfer. Late-night caffeine overload just wouldn't take me where
I had to go.</p><p>The solution to my particular dilemma was UUCP, the
Unix-to-Unix copy program. You may not be familiar with this relic
of the Stone Age of computing, but even if you are, our good
friends at O'Reilly &amp; Associates have created just the
companion you need: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using &amp; Managing UUCP</em></span>.
This tome is a consolidation of two older O'Reilly volumes,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing UUCP &amp; USENET</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using
UUCP &amp; USENET</em></span>. I was looking for UUCP information
exactly at the time the two older books were being superseded by
the new, and I ended up searching for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing UUCP &amp;
USENET</em></span> for quite a while with no success. The new book
wasn't available yet and I could find no other reference that
promised as much information, so I ordered a copy from the local
bookstore before it was even released. As with every other O'Reilly
book in my library, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using &amp; Managing UUCP</em></span>
is readable enough for background information, extensive enough for
a reference and visually attractive.</p><p>The book's organization is straightforward. The first half
covers UUCP programs and commands, including such details as how
your shell affects command syntax. It dives right into UUCP usage
with copious examples of command syntax and results. The style
lends itself to experimentation with commands while reading the
text and presents commands in the order in which a novice is most
likely to need them.</p><p>The first section of the book was very useful for me, but it
was the promise of the second section that sent me scurrying out
with credit card in hand. Most of us in the Linux world are our own
system administrators and gurus, and I'm no exception. There was no
one handy to ask about UUCP setup, and the documentation for Linux
would not help me with the idiosyncrasies of a legacy system. It is
in this area that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using &amp; Managing UUCP</em></span>
shines. System-specific issues are sprinkled throughout the text,
and cover the gamut of current Unix operating systems. The
discussion of serial ports, device files and system dependencies is
quite useful, particularly the information on enabling serial ports
for login under various Unices. The major flaw of the second
section is that the level of assumed knowledge is pretty high. If
you don't know about serial communications and Unix initialization,
be prepared for a steep learning curve.</p><p>No book review would be complete without a little
nit-picking, and I have a few. First is the apparent deletion of
the truly archaic information specific to some Unix variants. UUCP
has been around a long time, and legacy systems running old code
are common. I ordered this book based on the description of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing UUCP &amp; USENET</em></span> on O'Reilly's web
site, and information about older systems was the main reason I
wanted it. Another (small) nit is the lack of a good introductory
section describing program versions in the wild. This information
does appear at the beginning of the second section of the book, but
by that time the novice's head is already spinning. Finally, the
organization of the technical information is a little haphazard.
This may make the book more readable, but less useful as a
reference or problem solving guide. I would have preferred to see
system-specific information placed in its own chapter.</p><p>Linux users already have several good sources of information
regarding UUCP setup: the Network Administrators Guide, the UUCP
HOWTO and the Serial HOWTO. If you have to set up UUCP between two
Linux boxes and these guides do the trick for you, you need go no
further. However, if you have to work with non-Linux systems and
want more in-depth information or run into problems,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Using &amp; Managing UUCP</em></span> is worth the
cost.</p></div></div>
