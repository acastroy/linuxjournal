    A HOWTO for Debian package management.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1830608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Debian has one of the most powerful and
versatile package management systems of any Linux distribution. It
is also incredibly cryptic. However, once you start using it, I
promise it does get easier.
</p><p>Debian's basic package management tool is
<span   class="bold"><b>dpkg</b></span>. dpkg is actually built on
top of <span   class="bold"><b>dpkg-deb</b></span>, but I'll get into
that later. There are a suite of tools built on top of dpkg,
including <span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-get</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>console-apt</b></span> and others. This
article functions as a HOWTO, providing commands and instructions
on ways to manipulate dpkg and receive pertinent information about
your Debian, or Debian-based system. I'm not going to cover
everything, but enough so that, you'll be able to use the package
management capabilities of your Debian-based system with
proficiency.</p><p>Every Debian package is an archive ending with the extension
&ldquo;.deb&rdquo;. For this article, I'll refer to a package as a &ldquo;deb&rdquo;.
debs are usually named in the following manner:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zsh_3.1.6.pws21-1.deb
</pre><p>For the examples in this article, I use &ldquo;foobar.deb&rdquo; when a
deb needs to be substituted, and &ldquo;foobar&rdquo; when a package name is
to be substituted.
</p><p>For those familiar with the Red Hat Package Management (RPM)
system, dpkg's approach to package management is much different in
its approaches. RPM is a file-based package manager, meaning it
checks for specific files required by a package like
libgtk-1.2.so.0. In contrast, dpkg is package-based, so it checks
to see if you have a specific package, such as libgtk1.2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1830a80"></a>Dpkg: The Root of All Debian</h2></div></div><p>Most people will not use dpkg for day-to-day package
management, but it is an incredibly powerful and useful tool.
Dpkg's most basic action is to install a package, which is done
with the command <b  >dpkg -i foobar.deb</b>. This will
install the package, while backing up any existing versions of the
package. The command <b  >dpkg -i -R /foo/bar</b> will
install all of the debs in a directory.</p><p>We all know from experience that sometimes a package won't
install properly or refuses to configure. Or maybe the user aborted
the configure process. dpkg has some helpful tools for making the
configuration process easier. In these instances, <b  >dpkg
-configure &lt;package&gt;</b> will finish the configuration
of the specific package, and <b  >dpkg --configure
--pending</b> will configure all packages with configuration
pending.</p><p>It is just as easy to remove packages with a few simple
commands. Using either <b  >dpkg -r &lt;package&gt;</b>
or <b  >dpkg -remove &lt;package&gt;</b> will remove a
package and leave its configuration files. If you want to remove
all files related to the package, including its configuration
files, use the command <b  >dpkg --purge
&lt;package&gt;</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1830ea0"></a>Getting Information</h2></div></div><p>Debian package management provides several ways to find
information on what packages are currently installed and what files
each package provides. One way to sort packages is by using a
pattern, facilitated with the command <b  >dpkg-l
&lt;pattern&gt;</b>. If necessary, a wildcard can be used as
the &lt;pattern&gt;. Using dpkg -l alone will provide a list of all
the packages currently installed on your system.</p><p>Using Debian package management also allows you to see what
files were installed by a specific package with the command
<b  >dpkg -L &lt;package&gt;</b>. Alternatively, to find
out which package owns a file use <b  >dpkg -S
&lt;file&gt;</b>. These searches can also be done with a
pattern, including wildcards.</p><p>When you need to get information about a particular deb, this
list of commands is helpful:</p><p>dpkg -I foobar.deb lists detailed information about a debdpkg
-c foobar.deb lists the contents of a deb, similar totar's -c
option.dpkg -x foobar.deb &lt;dir&gt; extracts a deb intothe
specified directorydpkg -X foobar.deb &lt;dir&gt; lists the files
asit extracts them, like tar's-v option</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x18311b8"></a>Force It!</h2></div></div><p>In addition to all of the useful information that dpkg
accesses for productive package management, it also has a rich set
of options for screwing up your package management system royally.
To quote dpkg's manpage, &ldquo;Warning: These options are mostly
intended to be used by experts only. Using them without fully
understanding their effects may break your whole system.&rdquo; I won't
cover this set of options here, as you should never really need to
use them. However, if you ever need to force dpkg to ignore
dependencies, overwrite files installed by other packages, ignore
conflicts or anything else the Debian package management system is
designed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>prevent</em></span>, look at man dpkg.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1831318"></a>APT</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>APT</b></span> stands for &ldquo;Advanced
Package Tool&rdquo;. It does a wonderful job of simplifying the life of
a Debian user. If the last session discouraged you, fear not! APT
is what I use for most of my package management. Why then, you ask,
did I force dpkg on you? Because it's important to know what is
underneath APT.</p><p>The APT system consists of three major parts: the
configuration file, sources.list, and two programs called apt-get
and apt-cache. There also are some minor parts, like
apt-cdrom.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x18314d0"></a>sources.list</h2></div></div><p>Once you learn how to use it, /etc/apt/sources.list will
become one of the most important files in your system. For the most
part, <span   class="bold"><b>sources.list</b></span> consists of ftp
and http addresses where APT can go to pull information, and is a
great way to organize your resources in one location. A typical
entry looks something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstablemain contrib non-free
</pre><p>The first part of the entry is either &ldquo;deb&rdquo;, for a line
that specifies where to acquire binaries from, or &ldquo;deb-src&rdquo; which
specifies where to acquire debian source packages. The next part is
called a URI, which is similar to a URL; this is the root of the
debian directory. After the URI comes the distribution, which is
generally listed as &ldquo;stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; or &ldquo;unstable&rdquo;,
although a specific distribution, like Hamm, Slink or Potato, can
be used. Distribution can also be given as an exact path, in which
case it needs to end with a &ldquo;/&rdquo;, and no components can be
specified. Components are usually &ldquo;main&rdquo;, &ldquo;contrib&rdquo;,
&ldquo;non-free&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-us/main&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-us/contrib&rdquo; or
&ldquo;non-us/non-Free&rdquo;. That's about all you need to know to take
advantage of sources.list. CD-ROM entries are generated by
apt-cdrom (more on this later), so you don't need to write those by
hand.
</p><p>Editing the source.list file is done to change the sites APT
uses (changing mirrors), to change which distribution APT will be
getting packages from, or simply to add new URIs for &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo;
debs, or sites which maintain newer debs, like KDE and HelixCode,
respectively. After editing this file, you should always run
<b  >apt-get update</b>. For a listing of Debian mirrors
to use, check
<a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_self">http://www.debian.org/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x18317e8"></a>apt-cdrom</h2></div></div><p>One way to add your Debian CD-ROMs to APT's database is with
the remarkably easy-to-use
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-cdrom</b></span>. The command
<b  >apt-cdrom add</b> should automatically mount your
CD-ROM (provided /dev/cdrom is correctly linked), scan it and
create the correct entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.</p><p>As with anything in Linux, that's not the only way to do it!
If your Debian CD-ROM is mounted (the mount point must be listed in
/etc/fstab), you can use a few flags to accomplish the task. Use
<b  >-d &lt;mount point&gt;</b> to specify the mount
point,<b  >-f</b> to make apt-cdrom
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> check the individual packages,
and <b  >-a</b> for a thorough package scan that will
look for package files everywhere on the CD-ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1831b58"></a>apt-get</h2></div></div><p>Debian's greatest claim to fame is
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-get</b></span>, an incredibly smart
(okay, smart <span   class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span> of the time), easy-to-use
package tool that automatically deals with package dependencies and
conflicts. The first thing you should do (and do it every time you
edit /etc/apt/sources.list) is run <b  >apt-get
update</b>, which pulls the package information used by
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-cache</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-get</b></span> from these
locations.</p><p>Now, you can go about installing packages. APT's most used
action is probably install. To install a new package (and
automatically meet its dependencies), use <b  >apt-get install
&lt;package&gt;</b>. If there are other packages that must be
installed, APT will let you know before downloading them.</p><p>If you install a deb without meeting the requirements, or a
problem is encountered during install or removal, you will often be
unable to work with dpkg until the problem is resolved. One method
to use for solving these problems is the command <b  >apt-get
-f install</b>, which will try to work everything out and ask
questions as it goes along.</p><p>APT can also download sources with <b  >apt-get source
&lt;package&gt;</b> if you have any deb-src lines in your
/etc/apt/sources.list. To remove packages, use <b  >apt-get
remove &lt;package&gt;</b>. If you want to clean out the
archives, there are two options. To remove all archives, the
command is <b  >apt-get clean</b>; if you only want to
remove old archives, use <b  >apt-get autoclean</b>
instead. When the time comes to upgrade all packages to their
latest version, one easy command, <b  >apt-get
upgrade</b>, will take care of it. Meanwhile,
<b  >apt-get dist-upgrade</b> is suited for upgrading to
a new version of Debian, automatically reconfiguring dependencies
for packages whose names have changed.</p><p>A few other command-line options are helpful when using
apt-get: &ldquo;-d&rdquo; only downloads archives but doesn't try to install
or unpack them; &ldquo;-s&rdquo; for simulation, it won't actually do
anything; &ldquo;y&rdquo; answers yes to all questions; and &ldquo;-b&rdquo; tries to
build a source package after downloading it.</p><p>Additionally, apt-get can use regular expression patterns
such as <b  >apt-get install '.*mame.*'</b> or
<b  >apt-get remove 'mozill.'</b>. Apt-get will also try
to match an element appearing at a specific point in the string.
For example, to match &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; only in the beginning position,
like &ldquo;pilot-manager&rdquo; and not &ldquo;gnome-pilot&rdquo;, use &ldquo;^&rdquo; (which is
the &ldquo;beginning of line&rdquo; character) in an expression like apt-get
install '^pilot.*'.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1828bd0"></a>Upgrading</h2></div></div><p>I have not yet found another distribution that makes
upgrading to a new version as easy as Debian does. As mentioned
previously, when you want to upgrade your version, simply change
the distribution part of the URI in /etc/apt/sources.list, then do
an <b  >apt-get dist-upgrade</b>. Often, it helps to run
<b  >apt-get dist-upgrade</b> a few times to get
everything happily installed and configured. You can only use this
to go to a newer version, from stable to frozen, stable to unstable
or frozen to unstable. You <span   class="bold"><b>cannot</b></span>
downgrade.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1828de0"></a>apt-cache</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>apt-cache</em></span> is great for finding
information about packages, even packages you don't have installed!
The command <b  >apt-cache show &lt;package&gt;</b> will
print various information about the package, including
dependencies, full name, what it provides, the short and long
descriptions, and, most importantly, the size when unpacked.
<b  >apt-cache depends &lt;package&gt;</b> provides a
list of what other packages the selected &lt;package&gt; needs
installed to work properly. To print a complete list of every
package available, use <b  >apt-cache
pkgnames</b>.</p><p>The most useful feature of apt-cache that I've found has to
be <b  >apt-cache search &lt;string&gt;</b>. This option
will search through all package names and descriptions looking for
occurrences of your &lt;string&gt; selection. Obviously, this can
be a great time-saving device.</p><p>To further assist your managing capabilities, there are some
options that apt-cache can utilize. For example,
<b  >-i</b> lists only the important dependencies,
<b  >-f</b> prints full records (just like &ldquo;show&rdquo;)
after a search and <b  >-names-only</b> limits searches
to package names.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1829258"></a>Frontends!</h2></div></div><p>While I can usually get by with dpkg for package management,
apt-cache for searching and apt-get for installation, sometimes I
want to get a better idea of what's available to me. This is where
dselect, console-apt and gnome-apt come in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1829360"></a>dselect</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span> is the granddaddy of
the Debian frontends. As the first part of the installation
process, it is the first thing new Debian users are greeted with,
and it scares them. And it's true that dselect can be incredibly
scary as well as incredibly dense. This section will be the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>short and sweet</em></span> introduction to dselect.
First, my best advice when using dselect is to read all of the
on-screen help. Although not very user-friendly, everything you
need to know is contained there.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4352f1.large.jpg"><img src="4352f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Dselect-Inspection of Package
States</p></div></div>
</p><p>When you first start dselect, you'll want to go to
&ldquo;[A]ccess&rdquo; to select the correct access method for installation.
Meaning, select &ldquo;nfs&rdquo; if you have a local nfs mirror of Debian,
and &ldquo;apt&rdquo; if you want to install over the Internet (http/ftp) or
if you've configured your sources.list for local addresses. Other
methods available are CD, Multi-CD (if your distribution has
multiple CD-ROMs as opposed to one), Floppy and Mounted.</p><p>Once you've selected your access method, dselect needs to
find out what packages it has access to; to accomplish this, select
&ldquo;[U]pdate&rdquo; and wait a minute.</p><p>&ldquo;[S]elect&rdquo; is where the actual package management happens.
First, you'll be presented with a help screen.
<span   class="bold"><b>READ IT!</b></span> When you finish
<span   class="bold"><b>READING IT</b></span>, press space to get out
of help or &ldquo;.&rdquo; to read the keybindings. You can move around the
package listings by searching or by using up/down,
page-up/page-down, home/end and left/right. The following are some
basic, useful keystrokes in dselect:</p><p>/ search\ repeats the last search? brings up helpd scrolls
down the package informationu scrolls up it</p><p>When you've highlighted a package you want to do something
with, use:</p><p>+ install or upgrade- remove= leave in present state</p><p>When you're ready to leave the selection screen,
select:</p><p>&lt;enter&gt; to confirm, quit and check dependenciesQ to
quit, confirm and override dependenciesX or Esc to abandon all
changes</p><p>After you press return, you may be presented with a list of
packages; these may be either dependencies of or conflicts with the
packages you selected. Look at the packages; the bottom half of the
screen will tell you what the problem is. Once you've resolved
these problems, press enter.</p><p>After you've made your changes in &ldquo;[S]elect&rdquo;, either
&ldquo;[I]nstall&rdquo; or &ldquo;[R]emove&rdquo; which will bring your system up to
date with the changes. &ldquo;[C]onfig&rdquo; is only necessary if any
package configuration failed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x1829b48"></a>Gnome-apt</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Gnome-apt</b></span> is a GUI package
manager for Debian built around Gnome. It is incredibly intuitive
and can be quite useful. Gnome-apt displays package sizes,
dependencies and just about any other relevant information in a
well laid-out interface. The packages are presented in a sorted
tree (see Figure 2), and gnome-apt can display packages broken down
alphabetically or by section, status or priority. It also has easy
and powerful search functionality. Gnome-apt is included in Debian
2.2 (Potato) and the current unstable distribution (Woody).</p><p>

front end for both RPM and Deb. It uses a combination of tabbed and
tree interfaces (see Figure 3), and the functionality is similar to
gnome-apt. One of the cool features of Kpackage is that the
dependencies are hyperlinks to the packages they reference.
Kpackage also lists the files included in each installed archive
and checks to make sure they all exist. It can be found at
<a href="http://www.general.uwa.edu.au/u/toivo/kpackage" target="_self">http://www.general.uwa.edu.au/u/toivo/kpackage/</a>.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x182a280"></a>console-apt</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>console-apt</b></span> is a new front
end just for APT. Currently, it is only available in the unstable
distribution of Debian; as it is still in development, I won't say
too much about it. Console-apt does have some nice features,
though, including a much more intuitive and usable interface,
progress indicators for downloads, selective upgrades and the
ability to search, sort and filter the package listings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1738580.0x182a3e0"></a>The End</h2></div></div><p>Using these options and features, you should now be able to
maintain and manage your Debian package system with ease. Trust me,
it sounds more complicated than it actually is. I've tried to
provide as many options as Debian offers but had to leave some out;
I have not yet been able to pry myself away from APT. In
conclusion, I haven't seen any RPM front end that I feel is on the
same level as APT.</p></div></div>
