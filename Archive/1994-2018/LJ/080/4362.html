    of web development and suggests some current trends that will affect how

the Forge. This is the 50th column that I have written for
<i  >Linux Journal</i> (or for SSC's short-lived
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Websmith</em></span> magazine) since early 1996. Over the
last few years, we have explored a large number of Web-related
technologies, techniques and applications, ranging from simple CGI
programs to sophisticated database-backed applications written
using mod_perl.
</p><p>This month, I want to spend a bit of time prognosticating,
looking into the future of web application development. On the one
hand, things have never been more exciting for web application
developers; the technology continues to advance at a remarkable
rate, making it easier and easier to create sophisticated
applications. At the same time, the increasingly crowded field of
embedded programming languages, application servers and database
adaptors makes it harder to decide which technology is most
appropriate.</p><p>Because this column describes where I believe web
technologies and application development are headed in the coming
years, it should also serve as a sort of guideline for what future
issues of ATF will contain. You can think of this month's
installment as an indication of where my consulting firm is headed
professionally, and thus what you can expect me to suggest and
describe in the year (or more!) ahead. Since this is
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and Linux is my company's
primary server platform, I will focus here on items that run with
Linux and, preferably, those that are free software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c24870"></a>Where Have We Been?</h2></div></div><p>Web application development began soon after the Web itself
was formed. Ever since the first dynamically generated content was
sent to the first browser&mdash;an act which predates the CGI standard,
to say nothing of Netscape, Internet Explorer and
Apache&mdash;programmers have been designing increasingly sophisticated
applications for use on the Web.</p><p>CGI, or the &ldquo;common gateway interface&rdquo;, soon arrived on the
scene. CGI got its name because dynamically generated content was
originally a means to give a web interface to non-web applications.
With the advent of CGI, it was suddenly possible to create portable
server-side programs. Most web applications continue to be written
using CGI, because of its simplicity and its extreme
platform-independent nature, as well as the fact that web space
providers can give their clients CGI access without endangering the
server's stability.</p><p>You can write a CGI program for any web server, in any
language, on any operating system, and be virtually guaranteed that
it will work. However, CGI has a number of drawbacks. In
particular, it requires that the web server spawn a new process for
each HTTP request aimed at a CGI program. In other words, a web
site that receives 100 hits/minute is spawning more than one new
process every second.</p><p>By itself, this should not scare you. After all, a basic
Linux box should be able to handle the creation of one new process
each second, right? However, the size of the new process, as well
as the speed with which it starts up, are both important
factors.</p><p>Perl, my programming language of choice for the last few
years, has proven itself as a powerful means for creating CGI
programs. The CGI.pm module provides an amazing array of functions
that do nearly everything you would ever want from a CGI program
(as well as a number of things that I would never consider doing).
Moreover, Perl includes a powerful pattern-matching engine, along
with modules that handle most popular Internet standards and
protocols. The DBI (database interface) module has proven to be an
additional boon, making it easy to include the output from an SQL
query in a dynamically generated page.</p><p>However robust, flexible and secure Perl might be, the CGI
standard was never designed for producing a large volume of
dynamically generated pages on the fly. Each invocation of a CGI
program written in Perl forces the computer to create a new
process, load Perl into memory, load your program into memory,
compile your program into Perl's internal opcodes and then,
finally, interpret it using the Perl run time mechanism. This all
takes time and means that CGI programs will not scale well over the
long term. Indeed, it does not take a lot of concurrently running
CGI programs to bring a typical server to its knees.</p><p>At the same time, CGI has been successful because it's so
easy to use. With no other API can you write a &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo;
program as simple as the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT    use strict;
    use CGI;
    my $query = new CGI;
    pring $querry-&gt;heder("text/html");
    print $query-&gt;start_html;
    print "P&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    print $query-&gt; end_html;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c24be0"></a>Embedded Languages</h2></div></div><p>In the last few years, advanced web development has become a
specialty of its own, requiring that programmers learn something
about administering systems, networks and databases, while keeping
in mind good programming and security practices.</p><p>There are three current trends in the world of web
development which are beginning to improve things dramatically for
users as well as for developers. When the three are used together,
they are often called an &ldquo;application server&rdquo;.</p><p>The first trend is architectural, moving away from
single-shot CGI programs and toward programs that are cached within
the web server or another environment. The only reason we use CGI
programs for creating dynamic content is that the web server itself
cannot create our custom HTML files on the fly. We could
theoretically write a new module for Apache in C, and compile that
into our configuration&mdash;but that is far too much work in most
cases, and the time savings is not worthwhile.</p><p>However, there is a middle ground between putting the custom
code inside of the server and leaving it completely outside. What
if we put an entire programming language inside of the server,
making it possible for us to add new functionality in that
language? If the language is interpreted, then we can modify and
debug our new functionality without having to recompile or restart
the server.</p><p>This is the idea behind
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, which embeds a copy of
Perl inside of Apache. It gives us a Perl-language interface to
Apache's internals, making it possible to access and modify
anything having to do with the request object. Everything that a
C-language module can do for Apache can also be done inside of
mod_perl, from creating custom response handlers to changing the
way in which authentication is performed.</p><p>In stark contrast with CGI programs, where Perl compiles the
program once, executes it once and exits, mod_perl caches a
compiled version of the program and then executes that repeatedly.
(This can sometimes cause extreme memory growth and requires that
programmers be especially careful.)</p><p>While mod_perl was once the only embedded language module for
Apache, others have come along recently.
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_snake</b></span> does for Python what
mod_perl does for Perl, making it possible to write custom Apache
handlers in Python. There is even a
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_tcl</b></span>, which provides embedded
Tcl inside of Apache, although I am not aware of any sites that are
using its capabilities.</p><p>Another open-source web server, AOLServer, has long contained
an embedded Tcl interpreter. Tcl procedures can thus be used to
create dynamic output, connect to a relational database and make
code conditional&mdash;all within the server itself, without having to
go to an external CGI program.</p><p>If you would prefer to use Python over Tcl, a beta version of
PyWX (Python Web Extensions) recently became available. PyWX
provides a Python API to all of the Tcl functions that AOLserver
normally provides. While this makes PyWX incompatible with most of
the Tcl code available for AOLserver, it does make it easier to
perform certain functions, given the wealth of Python modules
available on the Web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c250b0"></a>Mixing Code and HTML</h2></div></div><p>The second trend involves embedding code inside of HTML.
Microsoft's Active Server Pages are perhaps the best example of
such a practice, but there are plenty of other ones as well. On
Linux, we can choose from a variety of different systems, ranging
from Java Server Pages (JSPs), HTML::Mason (which works with
mod_perl), PHP and ADP.</p><p>I have worked with Java off and on since it was first
introduced, and was long ago convinced that it would be nice to
spend some time working with the language. Like many other people,
I was turned off by the idea of applets, which were slow, insecure
and buggy. However, in recent years, server-side Java has become
increasingly prevalent. Each Java &ldquo;servlet&rdquo; is a class that runs
inside of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Servlets can accomplish all
of the things that we might want to do when generating dynamic
content&mdash;they can talk to databases with JDBC, they can retrieve
and modify HTTP headers and they can produce responses whose
content depends on the user's preferences.</p><p>JSPs make it easier to work with servlets by assuming that
everything is literal HTML except for what is contained within
&lt;% and %&gt;. When a JSP is invoked from a web browser, the JSP
is compiled on the fly into a Java servlet, which is in turn
complied into a Java .class file. This .class file is loaded into
the servlet engine, executed and kept around for future
invocations. JSPs and servlets can use Java &ldquo;beans&rdquo;, objects that
can be used to model persistent behavior and to implement the
&ldquo;business logic&rdquo; that sits in the middle of most modern
three-tiered web applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> is a very powerful
tool for creating Apache handlers, but it can sometimes force you
to work at too low a level. For this reason, a fair number of Perl
modules exist that allow you to mix Perl code and HTML in some way
or another. HTML::Mason, which I profiled in a series of articles
earlier this year, is the system that I prefer because of its
simple syntax and the way it allows templates to incorporate one
another. While at YAPC::Europe in London this fall, I saw a
demonstration of the Template Toolkit, which seems to be similar to
HTML::Mason in its philosophy, except that it adds the notion of
&ldquo;plug-ins&rdquo;.</p><p>While Java and Perl are general-purpose programming languages
that are well-equipped for server-side web programming, PHP is a
language designed expressly for creating dynamic web pages. PHP
includes a large number of functions for working with a variety of
different kinds of files, databases and Internet standards. Recent
versions of PHP even allow you to work with Java objects, and a
CORBA adaptor is expected to be released in the near future. At the
same time, PHP requires recompilation every time you change the
included feature set; there is no notion of dynamically adding or
deleting modules from the system. If you install PHP before
deciding that you want to work with PDF files, you may find
yourself recompiling it simply to add such features.</p><p>Users of AOLServer have a similar system at their disposal,
known as ADP (&ldquo;AOLServer Dynamic Pages&rdquo;. An ADP page allows you
to mix Tcl with HTML, where the Tcl can use any of a number of
special procedures that are defined within AOLServer. You can thus
create an ADP page that retrieves information from a database,
interprets the contents of an HTML page returned from another
server or simply performs calculations based on a user's HTML form
inputs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c253c8"></a>Pooled Database Connections</h2></div></div><p>The third trend in the world of server-side programming is
the issue of persistent database connections. Database servers were
originally designed to handle one connection from each user every
day, rather than once per minute or once per second. Consider this:
if a CGI program connects to a relational database server once per
second, you are exercising the connection mechanism more than
86,000 times what it was originally intended. In some cases, this
does not mean very much, but there are many databases for which
each connection is an expensive operation.</p><p>One solution is thus to open a database connection when the
server first starts up and reuse that connection each time a
program needs to contact the database. This is roughly what the
Apache::DBI module does when working with Perl, Apache and
mod_perl. Each time you disconnect from a database with
$dbh--&gt;disconnect, Apache::DBI silently ignores your request and
keeps the connection around for the future. When you call
DBI--&gt;connect, Apache::DBI looks at the connection string and
tries to reuse an existing connection before starting a new one.
Since each Apache process services only one HTTP request at a time,
each process thus needs only one database connection. The savings
from this connect/disconnect sequence can be substantial. At the
same time, it means that every child Apache process needs its own
database connection, which can lead to dozens or hundreds of
simultaneous connections on a heavily loaded server.</p><p>AOLServer cuts down on the number of database connections by
using multiple threads rather than multiple processes. Because
threads exist within the same process, they can share data.
AOLServer takes advantage of this to create a small pool of
database connections, choosing a connection at random and handing
it to the thread handling an HTTP request as necessary. Database
connections are not dedicated to a particular thread and can be
shared as necessary, reducing the number of connections that the
server must open with a database.</p><p>Working with Java servlets and JSPs requires a different
model altogether. The Jakarta-Tomcat servlet/JSP implementation
normally exists outside of a web server, meaning that they're
always on Tomcat process, regardless of how many Apache child
processes are on the system. Within that Tomcat process, there may
be any number of servlet threads executing concurrently. Normally,
servlets and JSPs (and Java beans, which JSPs and servlets can use
to provide persistence and/or a high level of abstraction) connect
to a database using JDBC. But JDBC does not automatically provide
connection pooling; while JDBC 2.0 does provide this capability, it
is not completely automatic, and not many JDBC 2.0 drivers exist as
of this writing.</p><p>Other languages take a different tack. For example, database
drivers for PHP allow persistent database connections but require
that the programmer ask for them. That is, you can connect to a
PostgreSQL database with pg_connect, or you can create a persistent
connection to PostgreSQL with pg_pconnect. The onus is placed on
the author of a database driver to provide two different access
functions, and on the PHP programmer to use the appropriate
function for his or her needs.</p><p>Of these, I find AOLServer's technique of persistent, pooled
connections to be the most elegant, since it works for all
languages --although that is almost always going to be Tcl&mdash;and
scales extremely well. mod_perl's Apache::DBI is a great solution
for Perl programs, especially since it means that individual Perl
programs and modules do not need to be changed in order to take
advantage of the persistent connections. The fact that Apache::DBI
only provides persistence, and not pooling, is a direct result of
Apache's multiple processes; it is probably safe to assume that
Apache 2.0, which will support threads as well as processes, will
come closer to AOLServer's model when it is released.</p><p>JDBC's pooling is good, particularly after it seemed that
everyone was writing their own class for connection pooling.
However, it will only work for Java servlets and will not help on a
server that requires a pool for multiple services, such as mod_perl
and JSP. PHP's system is perhaps the crudest because it provides
neither a standard database API, nor a means for database drivers
to pool connections automatically, nor a way for programs to take
advantage of those connections. However, the persistence does work
and can certainly result in a significant speedup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c256e0"></a>Where Are We Going?</h2></div></div><p>While I generally dislike the term &ldquo;application server&rdquo; for
its ambiguity, it is clear that this is the direction in which the
Web is moving. No longer will you design applications by writing
one or more programs that exist on their own; rather, you will
write a program using a set of objects and modules provided by the
application server and into which your application fits naturally.
In many cases, you can create relatively sophisticated applications
with a minimum of work, simply because someone else has done the
majority of the work for you.</p><p>Of course, this means that we're increasingly seeing
operating systems as the underlying layer for an application
server, where the latter is the truly important element. Just as a
client-side application author must decide whether to write for
Windows, UNIX or Macintosh, web application developers must
increasingly decide which application server they prefer to use. As
with operating systems, it is very difficult to move from one
application server to another. This means, unfortunately, that
choosing an immature, slow or difficult-to-modify server may be
painful in the future. Even application servers that conform to the
same standards and use the same language, such as Enhydra and ATG
Dynamo, provide different objects and functionality and make it
difficult to move from one to the other.</p><p>To a free software devotee like myself, this means that
open-source application servers are at least as important as
open-source operating systems. Luckily, there are a number of
open-source application servers available for download from the
Internet. They differ radically in their operation and
functionality, but I must admit that I have had only a little
exposure to each of the following technologies. While I hope to
learn more about them in the coming months, I mention them because
it is clear that web developers need to learn more about all of
them.</p><p>Perhaps the best-known application server platform is Zope,
which comes with a number of parts and isn't well understood. Zope
is an object database, a templating system and even a basic content
management system. I have not yet had a chance to play with Zope in
a serious way, but the little that I have read and heard about it
seems very impressive, particularly if a module is already
available for the particular functionality you need.</p><p>Another application server that has been getting a lot of
publicity is the ArsDigita Content System, written and maintained
largely by the ArsDigita consulting company and released under the
GNU Public License. One main problem with ACS has been its
dependence on Oracle as a database; while Oracle is an excellent
database product, it is both expensive and its source is quite
closed. A volunteer effort known as OpenACS has been working to
solve this problem by porting the ACS software to use PostgreSQL as
a database. The software is not quite complete but does include a
great deal of functionality and will undoubtedly improve over
time.</p><p>XML has been a hot topic in the Web community for several
years now, but only in the last six to nine months have we begun to
see its widespread adoption. XML describes content semantically,
completely ignoring the way in which it should be displayed.</p><p>Enhydra is a Java-based application server that seems similar
to Zope in many ways, except that it works with XML, Java servlets,
JSP and Enterprise Java Beans. Enhydra appears to be quite complex,
but also provides a large framework on which to create
applications.</p><p>If you want to work with XML, then you might also want to
look at the Cocoon and AxKit projects. Cocoon, which is sponsored
by the Apache Software Foundation, is working on a Java-based
server for XML data. AxKit provides XML-based content generation
using Perl, making it possible to separate programs from content,
and content from graphic design, using XML, XSL and XSLT along with
Perl.</p><p>Finally, I should mention Oracle's latest entry into the
world of application servers, its Internet Application Server
(IAS). IAS is a module within Apache that works with a Java run
time system, Enterprise Java Beans, JSP and JDBC, along with
Oracle. As of this writing, the system is largely new and untested.
Of course, Oracle does not provide access to its source code. At
the same time, IAS runs under Linux and may well be a popular
choice among Oracle users and administrators.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c25aa8"></a>Where Am I Going?</h2></div></div><p>Until now, the majority of my consulting work has been with
Perl, which I still find to be a powerful language for working with
the Web. Indeed, I used to tell people that about 80% of my work
was with Perl, with the other 20% a mixture of Java, Python, Tcl
and C.</p><p>But with the recent explosion in web programming
environments, and with the shift to application servers, I (and my
staff) have had to change direction somewhat. In many cases, we
will prefer to use Perl, especially when coupled with mod_perl and
HTML::Mason. However, we are increasingly using Java servlets and
JSPs for projects, particularly with the Tomcat servlet/JSP engine
and with the PostgreSQL database. Our familiarity with mod_perl is
naturally leading us to look at AxKit, while servlets are forcing
me to take a serious look at Enhydra.</p><p>We have already begun to use ACS for some large jobs, in no
small part because of the very large number of working
applications&mdash;not just underlying tools&mdash;that come with it.
Moreover, the fact that ACS is free software and works with Linux
makes it easy to work with since we can rely on the community to
provide functionality, documentation, testing and bug fixes.</p><p>In other words, there are lots of technologies out there,
many of which have sprung up only within the last year or so. As I
complete this 50th ATF column and look toward the future, I see a
world of possibilities and opportunities for web developers,
particularly those who believe in free software and use Linux. The
coming years promise to be exciting and interesting for web
developers&mdash;and over the coming months and years, I hope to share
with you my experiments and experiences in working with such tools,
as well as sample pieces of software that can be used with
them.</p><p><a href="4362s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
