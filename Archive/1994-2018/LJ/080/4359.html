as a defining factor of life. To the yoga guru, mantra is sound,
sound is forever echoing through the chasms of the universe, and
the universe is god. And, to most of the Linux gurus I've conversed
with, this is the way they feel about Linux in the world of
operating systems. So the collision of these two worlds, to some,
could be as tragic as spilling that morning coffee into your hard
drive just before you finish that project that was due an hour ago.
Or it could be so exciting that you can't help but be nice to that
man who cut you off on your way to work, and sent you swerving into
the other lane. After reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Music &amp;
Sound</em></span> I hope that, with a little mentorship, mutating
into a hybrid of musician and Linux geek will be a safe adventure
for the fearful reader.</p><p>As to what that adventure truly is, the courageous Dave
Phillips attempts to lead us on a safari of sound brought to us
through different audio software and the jungle of Linux. He starts
our journey by giving a very brief history of Linux. He then
describes what the main applications of audio editing and creating
sound software are and how to maximize your system to benefit from
this digital repository of tools. After explaining most of the
audio programs that should have been included with the current
version of X, the author leads us further into the wild electric
savannah to several different soundfile editors, such as MIXViews,
Snd, Kwave, Broadcast 2000 and Ceres. The following chapters lead
us through different types of programs such as Mod applications,
MIDI, MP3, hard-disk recording, mixing, sound synthesis, music
notation, networking audio, digital DJ, drum machines, operating
emulators and video games.</p><p>The charging rhino of this book is the ninth chapter on sound
synthesis. If you have very little or no experience with Linux and
digital audio, this chapter will be as incomprehensible as why
people listen to the Backstreet Boys and Brittney Spears. If you
understand the tribal tongue of Linux, you will learn how Csound
and all of its helpers can be very powerful tools to compose and
edit soundfiles and MIDI. This chapter gives some help as to
configuring and understanding the code; however, it's more of a
guide to performing tasks and loading Csound helpers. It also
provides some understanding of what they do.</p><p>Tutorials for digital studio recording are uncharted
territory in this book. There is no guidance to teach the common
musician how to use Linux with his digital recording experience.
Phillips does address every type of audience&mdash;the Linux musician,
the Linux programmer and the non-Linux digital musician&mdash;but not
every software evaluation.</p><p>In some chapters, the author's explanations are so elementary
that he mentions what kind of cord to use and how to plug it into
the jack: &ldquo;Make sure the plugs are firmly in the jacks: Loose or
shaky connections can result in dropouts, static, and other noise
conditions.&rdquo; In others, he assumes that one paragraph on sound
synthesis and one on MIDI is enough explanation to convey a
complete understanding of how to apply them to a digital studio. I
hope that anyone who can use a computer or plug something in knows
that a loose jack is not a good thing. However, I know a few people
who have recorded full digital CDs and don't understand what
synthesis and MIDI are and how to use them. This book should not be
your first choice if you want to learn about digital recording or
Linux applications and their difference from non-open-source
software. The book, along with some of the included software,
cannot be well understood unless you are already a Linux programmer
and a knowledgeable digital producer. If you're not a lion tamer
avoid the lions.</p><p>The enlightening part of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Music &amp;
Sound</em></span> is that it briefly introduces many programs, and,
since they are open-source, if they're not on the CD provided with
the book, they can be downloaded for free. URLs are conveniently
provided throughout the text. If you understand the capabilities of
the programs, you will appreciate that the author points out all of
the audio beasts and lets you choose which ones are best suited for
your needs, rather than pushing his own opinions.</p><p>Being more of a digital musician than a Linux user, I can see
why it is not as widely used as other software. Other software,
such as Pro Tools, Logic, and Sonic Foundry's Acid and Sound Forge,
do not require many technical skills and have everything built into
one program, so there is no need to switch files from one program
to another. These programs range in price from $30 to $400 (I spent
$60 on my studio), which is not as good as free, and certainly not
open source. This is something that can be frustrating to a
programmer. I have never felt that these programs have hindered my
recording process and, to a musician without a knowledge of Linux,
spending money for software is easier than learning a new operating
system.</p><p>However, most of the software released for Linux has not even
reached version 1.0, yet can already handle professional procedures
and produce as high-quality sound as its costly opponents. If
program writers continue progress on the software, and the music
world starts to take notice of Linux, I believe it will cause many
studios to switch from the products they currently use to Linux, as
is happening in other arenas.</p><p>If you are looking for a how-to book for digital recording on
Linux, look elsewhere. The best way to think of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Music &amp; Sound</em></span> is as a buffet of audio software,
which I found to be quite tasty. If you can't presently figure out
what to use to record, or where to find software, this book should
be your first desire. If nothing else, it will lead you deep into
the jungle of new toys for your Linux machine.</p></div></div>
