yet, a war. That's why we're eager to cast two successful
competitors&mdash;whether or not they're succeeding at each other's
expense&mdash;as warriors fighting over market share.</p><p>The best copy, of course, are David vs. Goliath stories. IBM
was Goliath for decades. Davids came and went. There were the BUNCH
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>there's</em></span> a memory test) then there was
Digital, then Apple. Steve Jobs loved the role of David. After
Microsoft took over the Goliath part, the Steve-less Apple made a
pathetic David. Marc Andreessen and Netscape put in a much better
performance. Now Marc has been replaced by Linus Torvalds.</p><p>But Linus isn't following the script. In the server business,
Linux is turning into another Goliath, even though Microsoft isn't
going away. As the latest IDC numbers show, both Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> Microsoft are winning, big time. The
losers are NetWare and UNIX. The sad news is that IDC lumps
UNIX&mdash;Sun, HP and the rest of them&mdash;into one shrinking non-Linux
group.</p><p>Between 1996 and 2003, IDC expects UNIX to lose half its
share. NetWare was already declared dead by the press back when it
led the pack, in 1996 (I remember, because I was working for those
guys back then).</p><p>On the client side, the story isn't quite as interesting
because there are no Davids, including Linux. It's almost all
Windows.</p><p>Not that Linux is chopped liver. IDC shows Linux edging ahead
of Macintosh on the desktop by 2003, leading by 5.5 to 5.2%.
Amazingly, it also shows Windows gaining with almost a 90%
share.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Doc Searls (<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>) is senior

Adopts Linux</h2></div></div><p>by Drew Robb</p><p>Free Linux Download Snowballs into Citywide Government
Deployment.</p><p>Five years ago, the IT department in the City of Garden
Grove, California faced significant budgetary constraints. Rather
than continue to pay for proprietary software, Charles Kalil,
acting information systems manager for the city, decided to check
out Linux. He downloaded it for free, installed it and liked what
he saw.</p><p>Five years later, Linux is running on six servers and 386
PCs. It serves everyone from the public works department to the
fire department, and they couldn't be happier with the results.
&ldquo;Our citywide Linux network has operated continuously for over a
year without crashing,&rdquo; said Kalil.</p><p>As an experienced NT system manager, he believes that it is
possible to achieve similar performance from NT. But that means
limiting each NT box to only one type of service. &ldquo;Linux can
stably handle file/print serving, mail server and more on one
machine,&rdquo; said Kalil. &ldquo;NT can't.&rdquo;</p><p>When the city began experimenting with Linux, it was
originally looking at buying an NT network. But that meant
purchasing multiple servers, licensing agreements and added
software costs. &ldquo;Linux came as a free download that also included
a Web server, mail server, Samba file, and print sharing, and
Network Files System (NFS) capabilities,&rdquo; said Kalil. &ldquo;With the
alternatives such as SCO and NT, these were either not included or
you had to purchase them separately.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn't all clear sailing for Garden Grove, however.
Running Linux in 1995 was much more adventurous than today due to
lack of support and a shortage of applications. Despite that, the
city set up a Linux database that has been running ever
since.</p><p>From a cost standpoint, the difference was substantial.
Garden Grove replaced a $400,000 Data General minicomputer with two
Pentium 90 servers that cost $5,000 combined.</p><p>Kalil also found that certain applications could not be
ported to Linux. &ldquo;We still use NT for imaging software on our
optical jukebox,&rdquo; he said. The City of Garden Grove also maintains
a GIS server running NT. Once again, the GIS software does not have
a Linux port.</p><p>But as far as price, reliability and availability are
concerned, the city is fully committed to being a Linux-based shop.
&ldquo;We found that we didn't need high-price servers due to the
efficiency of the Linux kernel,&rdquo; said Kalil. &ldquo;Further, we can
obtain the same results as NT with about half the memory.&rdquo; [See

and the city of Garden Grove&mdash;Editor]</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Drew Robb is a Los Angeles-based freelancer

SUN&mdash;COBALT</h2></div></div><p>There has always been a strange relationship between Cobalt's
primary business model and its most obvious product: the
self-branding Qube. Every time I spoke with him, Stephen DeWitt
made it clear that his company's business was selling rackmounted
servers&mdash;its RaQ brand, especially&mdash;to ISPs who, in turn, would
sell box-resident, value-added services to their customers. In
fact, Cobalt has developed a large number of third parties whose
applications could be packaged with Cobalt RaQs and sold to
ISPs.</p><p>The Qube was a great little product, easily put to use
anywhere one could find a constant Net connection and an available
IP address, basically for SOHO settings. It was an easy product to
love&mdash;a bright blue cube with a wide greenish light in the front.
But the server appliance market was yet another one of those
zero-billion dollar categories that would get around to delivering
their promise when broadband was less the exception than the rule.
As Qube observer Luke Tymowski puts it, &ldquo;There's more money to be
made selling RaQs to ISPs than Qubes to you and me.&rdquo;</p><p>But when Cobalt sold itself to Sun Microsystems a few days
ago (I write this on September 30, 2000), the Qube and the
Appliance Category seemed to be the whole story.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span> told a typical
story. Under the headline &ldquo;Sun to Buy Cobalt for $2 Billion&rdquo; ran
the subhead &ldquo;Deal gives company market for low-cost server
appliances&rdquo;. In the first sentence, Cobalt was identified as &ldquo;the
maker of a compact server-in-a-box&rdquo;. The obvious manifestation of
that label is the Qube, but the practical one is the RaQ. And
Cobalt has done a remarkable job of productizing RaQs as
appliances&mdash;as plug-and-serve devices. Its on-line literature says,
&ldquo;Now in its third generation, the Cobalt RaQ is a mature, proven
server appliance already in use in 1/3 of all the Tier 2 and Tier 3
service providers around the world. In fact, Cobalt RaQ is the
server of choice globally because the Linux-based system does not
require the constant attention of very expensive IT
engineers.&rdquo;</p><p>Cobalt has had very good marketing instincts from the
beginning, playing the Linux label much the same way as it played
the appliance label. The question now is whether Sun will tamper
with that success. Sun has always gone out of its way to say it
&ldquo;supports&rdquo; Linux but remains anything but a &ldquo;Linux company&rdquo;.
Now with Cobalt it has bought one of the most familiar Linux
companies in the world.</p><p>However, Cobalt, unlike VA Linux and other Linux hardware
companies, has been a Linux company only to the extent that it
employed Linux as a small, handy commodity OS. It also used a
small, handy commodity microprocessor. Any idea what it is? Hint:
it's not Intel or Motorola. There's marketing at work for
you.</p><p>Among all the literature provided to me by Cobalt during the
Spring Linux World Expo in 1999, the only mention of Linux was in
6-point type on the back of the company's data sheets. But, Cobalt
quickly welcomed identification as a &ldquo;Linux Company&rdquo; and surely
benefitted from that association with a big IPO in the fall of
1999. Around that time, &ldquo;appliance&rdquo; was becoming a hot term.
Cobalt soon wisely identified nearly all its products as &ldquo;server
appliances&rdquo;. Looks like it paid off.</p><p>Once Cobalt is part of Sun, there won't be much semantic
leverage left in the word Linux, simply because of Sun's antipathy
to the commodity OS. And sure enough, Sun is already reportedly
thinking about dumping Linux from Cobalt servers and replacing it
with Sun's own appliance-specific version of its operating system,
Solaris. One wonders if they'll also insist on SPARC processors.
But Luke Tymnowski says the fact that &ldquo;they are making noises
about moving the RaQs over to Solaris from Linux doesn't mean much.
It wasn't the OS that was remarkable, it was the web administration
interface.&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed. It's hard to imagine a simpler UI for a server than
the one Cobalt designed for it's appliances. Let's hope for their
sake that they keep it that way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1735580.0x1db8188"></a>Tech Tips</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1735580.0x1db8290"></a>Debugging Tip</h2></div></div><p>Handy for debugging and watching what's going on while it's
going on. Use tail with the &ldquo;f&rdquo; option, which lets you read the
end of a growing file. Examples:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tail -f /var/log/messages$ tail -f /var/log/syslog
$ tail -f /var/log/mail.log
$ tail -f /usr/local/httpd/logs/error_log

redirected easily to a file with &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;? Use
<span   class="bold"><b>script</b></span>. At a command prompt type
<b  >script</b>, then do what ever you need to log and
exit. The log of _ALL_ the stuff sent to your terminal finds its
way into a file called typescript! Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
