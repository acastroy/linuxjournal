on system administration, so if you're thinking of breaking into
this exciting career, where the stress is high but the hours are
long, now is a perfect time to pull up a spare Linux box and get
started.
</p><p>Replacing one big UNIX server with a rack full of inexpensive
Linux machines sounds like a great way to save money and increase
your server application's reliability and performance. But if
you're interested in setting up a high-availability Linux cluster,
have a look at how well your clustering technology of choice
handles the four failure scenarios in Tim Burke's &ldquo;High
Availability Cluster Checklist&rdquo;.</p><p>While we're on the subject of clustering, those of you
interested in pushing the envelope on Linux cluster performance
will want to read Ibrahim Haddad's article on the Parallel Virtual
File System. Don't try it on the accounting department's server,
though&mdash;PVFS is about speed, speed, speed and doesn't offer the
level of redundancy they're probably expecting.</p><p>One of the first concerns for anyone starting out in system
administration should be making backups. In &ldquo;A Linux-Based
Automatic Backup System&rdquo; Michael O'Brien explains not just how to
back up your Linux systems but also how to run a script on your
Linux system to back up files on your legacy Microsoft Windows
machines.</p><p>J. R. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Dobbs tells us that &ldquo;Too much is always better
than not enough.&rdquo; And that certainly goes for scripting. Marcel
Gagn&eacute; takes scripting to the extremes with an introduction
to Expect, the tool whose motto is &ldquo;Curing Those Uncontrollable
Fits of Interactivity&rdquo;. When you want to write scripts to do
everything, you might run into a brick wall&mdash;a program that tells
you to navigate a menu or enter a command. Instead of giving up and
doing it manually, write an Expect script to bend it to your will.
You are the sys admin, you are in control, not the machine, not the
software, you.</p><p>Last month, we complained that APC has not yet published the
protocol for communicating with their UPSes. Fortunately, Riccardo
Facchetti has figured out how to talk APC-speak&mdash;whether APC likes
it or not&mdash;and so those of you with APC UPSes can safely shut down
when the UPS is drained. It's long, but worthwhile reading if you
want to protect your whole network from power outages. I'm running
apcupsd at home now, and it works great. One important tip: don't
forget to check what kind of serial cable you're using and put it
in the config file.</p><p>You might tend to think of port scans and such as tools for
breaking into a network, not for administering it. But read
Lawrence Teo's article and try running one on your own network some
time. You might find compromised hosts participating in a
distributed denial of service attack, improperly configured
systems, or just some weenie who decided to put a &ldquo;personal web
server&rdquo; to serve out stuff that you don't want public.</p><p>If you have a system administration idea that works for you,
please let us know. We might just want you to write an article
about it, and when you send it in, you can hear somebody say,
&ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="4372s1.html" target="_self">System Adminstration Feature
