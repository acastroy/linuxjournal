publishing my new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Administration: A
User's Guide</em></span> (Copyright 2001, ISBN 0-201-71934-7). Since
the focus of this issue is system administration, the kind folks at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> have provided me with an
opportunity to give everyone a sneak peek at what is to come.
</p><p>So, let me set the scene. It is a dark and stormy night (I've
always wanted to write that), and a lone sysadmin is working late
looking for ways to get home and still get his work done. This is a
snippet from Chapter 15, a chapter I call &ldquo;Creative Laziness&rdquo;.
Along with a sizable crowd of others over the years, I have been
preaching, I mean <span   class="emphasis"><em>speculating</em></span>, that creative
laziness can be a wonderful tool. The kind of lazy person I admire
works hard to find easier ways to do things and is always looking
for the simpler, more elegant solution to any problem. If I may
quote one of the greats of science fiction, Robert A. Heinlein,
&ldquo;Progress is made by lazy men looking for easier ways to do
things.&rdquo;</p><p>The introduction to this chapter covers a variety of
automation tools before arriving at this point.The hour has just
struck 23:00. The pizza is long gone, and the cafeteria is out of
coffee. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lights. Camera. Action....</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26be580.0x27b68c8"></a>Scripting for Interactive Sessions:
expect</h2></div></div><p>At first glance, it would seem that you are out of luck if
what you want to automate requires human intervention. There are
things that need a human: picking from a menu option, entering
passwords or making decisions based on the information presented.
Interactive applications require a user's reaction, don't they? The
answer, for the cleverly lazy system administrator, is not
always&mdash;thanks to a little program called
<span   class="bold"><b>expect</b></span>.</p><p>While I had heard of expect sometime before, I discovered how
useful this language was only a few years ago. My partner and I
were developing a web-based system that required regular updates
from the main computer's database, a database that would not allow
command line scripting. The data we needed required the execution
of an SQL statement that could only be entered via the vendor's
menu interface. That SQL statement would then generate the data
file we needed for the web interface. The whole process hinged on
writing something that mimicked a user sitting at a terminal and
entering information as the various prompts were presented to him
or her. expect, a software suite/language based on Tcl, was the
answer to this dilemma. Later, expect would make it possible to
stretch this web tool well beyond what we,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ahem</em></span>, expected at the time.</p><p>Still wondering whether <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> need it?
Remember that laziness discussion at the beginning of the chapter?
Well, pretend that you are working late and the last thing you need
to do before leaving is to log on to your remote site, make sure
that a specific application has been completed (it is always done
by 3:00 a.m.), and then download the file that application
generates back to your local site. It is now 10:00 p.m. and you
would much rather go home than wait there for the magic moment when
the file is ready. You could just launch an <b  >at</b>
job that starts <b  >ncftp</b> for the download, but you
don't know the file name since the output name changes at each run.
You find the name by logging into the menu system and checking the
completion log. I am purposely making this complicated to
demonstrate that there are instances that are hard to automate with
a simple shell script.</p><p>The basic format of an expect script is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/expect
# Comments on this script (name, what it does,
# optional)
spawn some_command
set response myanswer
expect "Some prompt . . . ."
send $response\r
close
</pre><p>Here's what happens. The &ldquo;spawn&rdquo; keyword tells expect to
begin some program. This could be a shell (<b  >spawn
/bin/bash</b>) or any kind of command through which the
session will take place. With the &ldquo;set &rdquo; keyword, I am setting
the variable <b  >response</b> to some predetermined
response. The language's namesake, the &ldquo;expect&rdquo; keyword does
exactly what it sounds like it does. It scans the output of
whatever command we invoked with spawn, searching for matching
text. Then, &ldquo;send&rdquo; responds to the expected text with the first
variable, <b  >$response</b>. Let's do something real
now.
</p><p>I run an Apache web server on my system with OpenSSL
extensions for secure transactions. Starting Apache with the
OpenSSL extensions running requires me to enter a security
passphrase in order for it to start up, because the private key
files on the server are encrypted (see Chapter 26, &ldquo;Building a
Secure Web Server&rdquo;). This is all fine if I am here to enter the
passphrase, but what happens if the server goes down when I am not
there? It hasn't happened for months, but these things happen and
we do go on holidays sometimes. It could be something as crazy as
me adding an SCSI card for my new tape drive. I might have
forgotten (it has happened) to restart the web server with OpenSSL
running. What then? To get around this problem, I wrote the simple
expect script you see below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/expect
# Routine: startapachessl
# Purpose: Start web server with OpenSSL active
#
log_file -a /tmp/expectlog
#log_user 0
spawn /bin/bash
sleep .2
send "usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl startssl\r"
expect "Enter pass phrase*"
sleep .2
send "mysecretphrasegoeshere\r"
sleep .2
close
</pre><p>When the system restarts, whether I am there or not, this
script will restart my Apache web server with OpenSSL running.
Looking at the script, you'll notice a couple of interesting
things. For instance, the <b  >log_file</b> parameter is
new. What this does is define a log file for the execution of this
script. Whether the file is written to or not is defined by the
<b  >log_user</b> parameter. If set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;, then
logging will take place. I tend to use <b  >log_user</b>
when I am still testing the script, but you may decide you want to
capture the output at all times. Notice as well that I am spawning
a bash shell to execute the script that starts my server. Then,
there are the <b  >sleep</b> statements. In all cases, I
have the shell wait one-fifth of a second before continuing .
Finally, the <b  >close</b> statement tells the spawned
process that there is nothing more to come. At this time, expect
terminates and returns to the process that spawned it.
</p><p>There is no doubt that you could program these functions with
other languages, but expect makes it easy. What you will find as
you go along is that not every tool is perfect for every job. For
quick and dirty automation of interactive applications, nothing
beats expect. Fully exploring expect would require a book of its
own (in fact, there is one). What I am trying to do is give you a
taste of what you can do with it rather than explain every aspect
of the language. Before I let you run off to do your own exploring,
let me take these examples one step further.</p><p>We all know that changing passwords on a regular basis is as
good a thing as choosing good passwords (see Chapter 6), and it is
a fairly easy thing to have users do when they log in, but it is
somewhat more difficult if they do not have a login account. I'm
talking about e-mail&mdash;only users, the ones whom you allow POP3 mail
pickup (or web-based e-mail) but no actual command prompt access. A
number of offices have precisely this kind of setup for their Linux
system&mdash;it serves as an e-mail or Internet gateway and allows no
logins. So, how do you allow users to change their passwords when
they aren't allowed to log in? After all, changing passwords is an
interactive activity as the following dialog will attest:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@myhost] # passwd
New UNIX password:
</pre><p>Even more complicated is that in order for non-root users to
change their passwords, they must first enter their old password,
so the dialog is even more complex. What now?
</p><p>You could create a web-based form whereby a user could enter
all that information up front (see Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4368f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Password Change Webform
</p></div></div><p>A Perl script behind the form would extract the variables and
pass them to an expect script that does the rest. If you are
curious about this little web application or would like to use it,
feel free to download it from my web site. In the meantime, have a
look at this segment from the application:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/expect
# Routine: psdcmd
# Purpose: to change a user's password with expect
log_user 1
set uservar [lindex $argv 0]
set currpassword [lindex $argv 1]
set newpassword [lindex $argv 2]
set renewpassword [lindex $argv 3]
#
# log_file -a /tmp/expectlog
# send_user "Spawning passwd command with uservar.\n"
spawn su -l -c "passwd" $uservar
expect "Password:"
sleep .1
send "$currpassword\r"
sleep .1
#
expect {
        "(current) UNIX password:" {send
"$currpassword\r"}
        "su: incorrect password" {exit 0}
        }
sleep .1
expect {
        "su: incorrect password" {exit 0}
                "New UNIX password:" {send
"$newpassword\r"}
}
sleep .1
expect {
        "BAD PASSWORD:" {exit 0}
                "Retype new UNIX password:" {send
"$renewpassword\r"}
}
sleep .1
expect {
        "su: incorrect password" {exit 0}
                "New UNIX password:" {exit 0}
}
#End of password change routine
</pre><p>The <b  >set varname [lindex $argv num]</b>
construct represents arguments passed to the expect routine. Notice
that our &ldquo;spawn&rdquo; parameter calls does an <b  >su</b> to
the username in order to change the password. By default, CGI
scripts on your web server execute as some unprivileged user like
&ldquo;nobody&rdquo; or &ldquo;www&rdquo;, so we need to change our effective user in
order to change the password. Incidentally, you want to keep the
default user for your Apache server as non-root. The alternative
constitutes a potentially horrific security weakness.
</p><p>There is one other new item in the script. Look at the
<b  >send_user</b> parameter. This is essentially a print
statement. I left it in the sample script because I wanted to show
you a clever way of debugging your expect scripts. Every programmer
has inserted debug statements into his or her code to monitor how
things were going. This is the same idea in this case. You can use
<b  >send_user</b> as a means of communicating with the
outside world in the course of the script's execution. Since I
capture the output of the expect script via my Perl script, I will
see these messages as well. By the way, the Perl script calls the
routine in this way (the entire command is on one line):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$return_code =3D `./psdcmd "$username" "$currpassword" "$newpassword" "$renewpassword" `;
</pre><p>As you can see, the expect script is called with the
username, current password, the new password and the new password
repeated. We could simply have passed the new password twice, but
we wanted to keep the verification aspect of the password change
routine to be as close to what the user would experience at the
command line. More to the point, it also is a good idea to force
the user to confirm the password before changing it.

expect, I am going to make the process almost
<span   class="emphasis"><em>impossibly</em></span> easy. Rather than manually creating
an expect script, how about letting a program do that for you, too?
When you install expect, you will also install a cool little
program called <span   class="bold"><b>autoexpect</b></span>. Simply
put, autoexpect will watch whatever you are doing in an interactive
session and create the expect script for you. Here is the format of
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
autoexpect -f script_outputfile command_string
</pre><p>For instance, let's imagine that we wanted to log in to a
remote system that is behind a firewall, essentially a two-step
login process. After we log in to the firewall, we then execute a
login (telnet, ssh, etc.) to yet another system on the internal
network, then execute a standard menu program. We would like to
have this whole process of logging in twice and starting this menu
automated for us. From the command prompt, we would then type this
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
autoexpect -f superlogin.script telnet firewall.mycompany.com
</pre>


When you have finished your login, you can exit the menu and log
out. autoexpect will have captured the entire session for you.
Before running your new script, you will probably want to do some
editing to clean things up a bit. autoexpect's output is probably a
little wordier than you want. Furthermore, you will want to remove
the lines that exit from your menu and log out, but the basics of
the script and all the prompts are captured there for you. Make the
script executable and you are almost done.
</p><p>There is still one other thing you will want to add. At the
end of your new expect script, add this command:
<b  >interact</b></p><p>This tells expect to return control to you after it has done
its work. Without it, expect closes the spawned process, and all
you've managed to do is log in and log out very quickly.</p><p>In no way do I intend this to be the definitive reference on
expect. I do, however, hope that this little introduction (indeed,
this whole chapter) will serve to whet your appetite and inspire
your imagination to explore other ways of developing constructive
laziness. After all, we all have other work to do.</p><p>What's all this on your screen about a magic cloak?</p></div></div>
