    PowerPlant Linux is a collection of various
    libraries and developer tools that aren't generally on a distribution CD
    or, if they are, are older than the latest, greatest and full-featured version
    you get here.

found everything you need on a single Linux distribution? If so, do
you never download newer versions of software off the Net?
</p><p>Few people can answer yes to all three questions above, and
this is where PowerPlant Linux comes in handy. It is a collection
of various libraries and developer tools that aren't generally on a
distribution CD or, if they are, are older than the latest,
greatest and full-featured version you get here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a23580.0x2b1bb30"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>Basically, if you're a developer and don't have the time, or
don't want to write code for a specific need, there is a good
chance you will find something helpful on CD. I am not going to
list every piece of software that is included since you can find a
complete listing on their web site.</p><p>First, you can find under-development versions of KDE and
GNOME that are a must-have for anyone who is doing programming
work. These versions tend to get rather old with time, but that's
what the automatic update is for (more on it later).</p><p>If you are still searching for the perfect IDE, you have over
ten to choose from, including one sponsored by the product makers,
KDE Studio. You also have KDevelop, the official KDE IDE and, of
course, its Gnome counterpart, gIDE, among others. For those in
search of the perfect programming language, you can find
implementations and tools for C/C++, Pascal, BASIC, Java, Perl,
Python and many others that, I must admit, I had never heard of
before.</p><p>The keyword in PowerPlant is latest. PowerPlant gives you the
latest DOSEMU, XFree86 4.0 (which only now is beginning to be
included in distributions), PHP 4, Perl 5.6, the latest 2.2 and 2.3
kernels, and a load of other applications and libraries. Every one
of the applications and libraries are in their most recent version,
including, but not limited to SQL servers, debuggers, game
libraries and implementations of the ICQ and IRC protocols.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a23580.0x2b1bd40"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The mostly red PowerPlant box contains four CDs and a manual.
The first CD has RPM versions of the included software, the second
CD has Debian packages and the third CD has .tar.gz sources. The
manual details their installation program, Magnum. Since I use
Mandrake, I will include a short description of the RPM installer
here.</p><p>The installer&mdash;which must be run as root&mdash;starts with the
registration screen. Registration is not compulsory unless you also
subscribe to their update feature, in which case it just makes
sense to register. There is a Never Register button that you can
use and live happily ever after (see Figure 1); I have registered
and haven't received any spam from them yet.</p><p>

Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>The installer next presents you with a small window (I chose
the graphical installation, there is also a text one) with an
Install and Uninstall button among others. Choosing Install brings
you to the list of provided applications, unless the RPM database
says they're already there (see Figure 2). When you choose a
package, the installer presents you with the package description
and the choice between a standard install and an install using
advanced options (see Figure 3). You will get to the advanced
screen if anything bad happens during normal installation (see
Figure 4). The RPM version of the installer allowed me to upgrade a
package if it was already there, force install it and/or skip
running the package scripts. If you don't know the RPM command line
by heart, you will find all those options described in the on-line
help.</p><p>

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4353f4.large.jpg"><img src="4353f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Advanced Options</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Uninstall button brings a list of PowerPlant packages
that have been previously installed on your system (see Figure 5).
The uninstallation process is similar to the installation
process.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a23580.0x2b1c9a0"></a>The Icing on the Cake</h2></div></div><p>You may have noticed that I counted four CDs in the previous
section, but I described only three of them. That is because the
fourth CD, although targeted at Linux developers also, is a bit
different; it is targeted at your spare time.</p><p>The fourth CD contains demos of the (in)famous Loki ports of
some of the best games out there: Civilization&mdash;Call to Power, Myth
II, Railroad Tycoon II, Quake III, Heroes III and Heretic II. You
can evaluate them for hours and hours before you decide if you want
to buy anything from Loki. Of course, all their released
open-source software can be found on the other PowerPlant CDs, such
as SDL and OpenAL, to name two.</p><p>To make the Loki CD more than a bunch of demos that you can
pick up from any game magazine, they added the full version of one
of their games, Eric's Ultimate Solitaire. It is a great tool when
waiting for long compilations to finish; it doesn't take many CPU
cycles, and game times tend to be short.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a23580.0x2b1cb58"></a>PowerPlant Developer Network: Auto-Update
Feature</h2></div></div><p>Of course, the KDE version included with PowerPlant Linux was
already outdated when I bought the CD, and I was an early adopter.
It is a sad fact, but you cannot avoid outdated versions no matter
whose CD you buy. This is where PowerPlant Developer Network comes
into the game with their auto-update feature. At the time I wrote
this, Red Hat had announced their subscription service; The
Kompany.com had one in place four months ago when their product
launched.</p><p>The PowerPlant installation program, Magnum, is both an RPM
front end and an auto-update tool; it automatically scans the
company web site for updates and offers to download them to your
computer automatically. This way, my KDE 1.9x, and everything else
in PowerPlant, is always up to date&mdash;while I sleep.</p><p>This subscription service is called PowerPlant Developer
Network and includes a yearly CD update besides the automatic
download. It's been less than a year since The Kompany.com launched
PowerPlant, but I promise to keep you updated on the next
CD.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a23580.0x2b135a0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Note that PowerPlant is not a Linux distribution; you need to
be already using Linux. Thanks to its developer-oriented content,
this is not a problem. PowerPlant may also seem small due to its
focused nature, but it has about 150 different applications and
will continue to grow with time.</p><p>Questions to their support e-mail address are answered
quickly: they were very responsive when I had a little problem with
KDE: they provided me with a patch on their ftp site.</p><p>If you're doing even hobbyist development on Linux, this
product is nice to have. Of course, if you have too much time on
your hands you can always download all the software yourself, but
assuming you have work to do, PowerPlant is a great help.</p><p><a href="4353s1.html" target="_self">Pros and Cons</a></p></div></div>
