    The following article is an expansion and revision of material
    found in my book, Linux Music and Sound, published by No Starch
    Press.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0b6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are many module file types,
including the MOD, IT, S3M/STM, XM, MED and 669 formats. The
original MOD format was used by ProTracker, one of the first
trackers (mod composition software) for the Amiga. Many of the mod
filename extensions indicate their origins on a particular tracker:
the IT format comes from the Impulse Tracker, S3M/STM is from the
ScreamTracker, MED is from the OctaMED tracker and so forth. The
various formats differ in the number of tracks allowed, the number
of samples supported and the permissible bit resolution of the
samples. Fortunately for Linux users, the most popular formats
(MOD, XM, and IT) are supported by the available trackers and
players.
</p><p>It should be noted that although trackers load and save
modules in only one or two formats, mod players typically support a
wide variety of file types. For example, the popular MikMod player,
included in almost every mainstream Linux distribution, handles at
least fifteen module formats, and the MODPlug plug-in for the
excellent XMMS player supports more than twenty mod file
types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0b818"></a>What Is a Mod Tracker?</h2></div></div><p>A mod tracker is an application for composing music with only
your computer and some sampled sounds. The basic design of a
tracker is similar to a MIDI pattern sequencer. A pattern is
defined by a number of beats that act as slots in which you place
(track) your samples. Each beat includes information about the
musical pitch for your sample, its instrument number and volume
setting, and optional effects such as vibrato, filters and panning.
Patterns are strung together in arbitrary sequences to create a
song. The song is then saved in one or more (depending on the
tracker) of the various mod formats.</p><p>Mod trackers first appeared on Amiga computers. Those
machines enjoyed on-board sound support capable of handling up to
four channels of 8-bit monaural sampled sound. With the advent of
decent affordable PC soundcards, MS-DOS became the next platform of
choice for module composers. Today excellent trackers are available
for Windows, the Mac and, of course, Linux.</p><p>Trackers are especially well suited for making beat-oriented
music such as pop/rock, techno and other dance styles, but because
any kind of sample can be used the software is certainly not
limited to any particular musical style. Check the MOD Archive,
MODPlug Central and the United Trackers web sites listed at the end
of this article for links to mod collections showing off the wide
range of music made with trackers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0b9d0"></a>Of MIDIs and Mods</h2></div></div><p>A tracker resembles a looping pattern MIDI sequencer. A
series of beats or measures defines the loop period, events are
placed on beats within the looping pattern, and there is some
degree of fine control over the individual event. An event here
means any sound file: events can be as simple as a single beat of a
kick drum or as complex as an entire drum pattern or violin
solo.</p><p>A MIDI file is very small compared to a mod, but it contains
no sample data and must rely on a soundcard or external synthesizer
to process its sounds and effects. A mod file includes sound sample
data along with the sequence timing information and is accordingly
much larger than a MIDI file.</p><p>The General MIDI (GM) patch map provides a specification for
a common layout of sounds for all soundcards. However, cards from
different manufacturers may fill their GM patch maps with samples
of dramatically differing quality. Because a module contains sample
data, a mod can be played on any computer with any soundcard, and
listeners will hear your music played with exactly the same sounds
that you used to compose it.</p><p>By now you might be thinking &ldquo;So why use MIDI at all?&rdquo;
There are some very good reasons: MIDI sequencers are more highly
evolved composition tools, with more possible connections to
external hardware and auxiliary software utilities; file sizes may
be a consideration, particularly if transmitted across
low-bandwidth network lines; and the MIDI Manufacturers Association
provides an industry-standard specification with a focused set of
definitions of MIDI's capabilities.</p><p>By contrast the mod scene seems more chaotic. Many trackers
have devised their own file types, which has led to a rather
bewildering profusion of formats, and there is no governing body to
help determine the organized definition and expansion of module
capabilities. However, if you want to compose using sampled sounds,
if you want listeners to hear your music with exactly the same
sounds as you composed it, and if you can live with a rather
&ldquo;middleweight&rdquo; file format, then module tracking may be just what
you're looking for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0bc38"></a>Of WAVs and MP3s</h2></div></div><p>Fortunately the situation is not an either/or scenario.
Programmer Guy Thornley has written a useful little program called
GMid2Mod that converts a standard MIDI file (preferably with a
General MIDI patch map) to an XM format module, employing the
default Gravis Ultrasound samples used by the TiMidity MIDI player.
Using GMid2Mod I converted a four-channel MIDI file (with four GM
instruments) to an XM-format mod. I used the MikMod player to
convert the module to a CD-quality (44.1KHz, 16-bit) stereo WAV
file, and I then used BladeEnc MP3 encoder to convert the WAV to an
MP3 file with a bitrate of 128KBps.</p><p>As the following comparison of the file sizes indicates, it
makes better sense for the composer of mods to distribute works in
the original module format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Interlude.mid 34KB
Interlude.xm  737KB
Interlude.wav 28MB
Interlude.mp3 2.5MB
</pre><p>Another advantage shared by MIDI and mod files (over the WAV
and MP3 formats) is the ease with which they can be studied, viewed
and/or rearranged in compatible composition software. For example
an XM module can be loaded into any tracker with XM support, just
as a standard MIDI file can be loaded into any MIDI sequencer that
supports the Standard MIDI File format. Compositions and
performances in the WAV and MP3 formats are not easily rearranged
or dismantled into their constituent instruments.
</p><p>Incidentally, if you want to head in the other direction,
Kokai Istvan has written Xm2Mid, a utility for converting XM-format
mods to standard MIDI files with a GM patch layout. It works best
if your module is arranged using an instrument set identical to the
GM patch map.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0bea0"></a>Linux Mod Trackers</h2></div></div><p>As of August 2000 I counted 13 trackers listed on the Linux
Sound &amp; Music Applications site. Which one(s) you prefer to try
will depend on your available resources, particularly your graphics
capabilities, as well as your interest in developing a tracker. For
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> users, Michael Krause's SoundTracker (see
Figure 1) is designed with an excellent GTK interface graphics,
while Cedric Roux's powerful Xsoundtrack (see Figure 2) uses common
Xlib graphics. Jason Nunn's FunktrackerGOLD (see Figure 3) is an
excellent console-based tracker requiring only the ncurses library
for its graphics.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4349f1.large.jpg"><img src="4349f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. SoundTracker</p></div></div>

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4349f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. FunktrackerGOLD
</p></div></div><p>Those three trackers have been developed to a stable and
usable status. Other Linux trackers include the Sarah Tracker,
Stupid Tracker [sic], and ocsatracker for the Linux console and the
Industrial Tracker, the Rapid Audio Tracker, and Insotracker for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> displays. All of this software is in various
stages of development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0c688"></a>Non-Tracker Trackers</h2></div></div><p>Tracker-style interfaces also appear in music software that
does not create modules. Juan Linietsky's unique Shake Tracker (see
Figure 4) combines the module tracking interface with MIDI output.
If your soundcard includes a hardware synthesizer with SoundFont
(sf2) support you can use its sound banks directly. Shake Tracker
has just begun its development course, but it is already usable,
and the author welcomes feedback and suggestions from users.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4349f4.large.jpg"><img src="4349f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Shake Tracker</p></div></div>
</p><p>Tim Janik and Olaf Hoehmann have created the BEAST/BSE system
which is an ambitious project that combines an audio synthesis
network with a tracker's composition interface (see Figure 5).
Currently, files are saved in the BSE format and are not compatible
with mod trackers and players. Like Shake Tracker, BEAST/BSE is in
early development, but it works and is already quite
impressive.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4349f5.large.jpg"><img src="4349f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. BEAST/BSE Pattern Editor</p></div></div>
</p><p>David O'Toole's GNU-OCTAL project plans to be the Linux
equivalent of the Buzz tracker for Windows. Buzz differs from other
trackers because it includes generators for sound synthesis, thus
eliminating the need for a separate sample library. GNU-OCTAL is
similarly designed, and although still in early development, the
project is definitely worth watching (or joining: remember, this is
Linux, where you too can get involved in the exciting world of
audio software development!).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc0cc60"></a>Linux Mod Players</h2></div></div><p>Mod players for Linux are also available in console and X
interfaces. As noted earlier, almost every Linux distribution
includes MikMod (see Figure 7), which is available in various
incarnations (e.g., console, GTK, Qt, Xforms, and Java). The
popular MODPlug player for Windows has been ported as a plug-in for
the excellent XMMS player (see Figure 6) and is also the playback
engine for Gmodplay.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4349f6.large.jpg"><img src="4349f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p><p>Table 1 lists the available Linux trackers, Table 2 lists the
players. The status ratings indicate the program's level of
usability. The higher the number of stars, the more complete the
application. Devel indicates that the application is at the alpha
or early beta development stage. Entries marked with ? indicate
that I was unable to build and/or run the application.</p><p>See the Linux Sound &amp; Music Applications site at
<a href="http://sound.condorow.net/mod.html" target="_self">sound.condorow.net/mod.html</a>
for a current list of these and other Linux mod trackers and
players.</p><p>Some of the popular mod trackers and players for Windows and
MS-DOS may also run under WINE, VMWare, or DOSemu, but I haven't
yet experimented with them. If you do try some mod software in
those emulation environments please let me know how well they
perform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc03b20"></a>Demos and Mods</h2></div></div><p>A demonstration program shows off neat graphics and animation
hacks which are often accompanied by a musical score. The music is
usually in a mod (or MIDI) format played by an embedded player
(MikMod's libmikmod is very handy for playing mods in Linux demos).
I highly recommend seeing the outstanding Loop, at
<a href="ftp://mustec.bgsu.edu/pub/linux" target="_self">mustec.bgsu.edu/pub/linux</a>
(binaries and sources are also available there), and State Of Mind,
at
<a href="http://skal.planet-d.net/mind/index.html" target="_self">skal.planet-d.net/mind/index.html</a>.
Both of those demos use an embedded libmikmod to play their
scores.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb13580.0xc03cd8"></a>Learning More about the Mod</h2></div></div><p>The United Trackers and MODPlug Central sites are excellent
guides to finding trackers and players, sample archives, links to
mod collections, and tracking tutorials. The MOD Archive lists an
enormous number of mods for your enjoyment and study. You might
also want to keep up with the alt.binaries.sounds.mods and
alt.music.mods newsgroups, where many independent musicians post
their creations, questions, and information regarding the very
active mod tracking scene. (See Resources)</p><p>In the next issue we'll take a look at SoundTracker.</p><p><a href="4349s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
