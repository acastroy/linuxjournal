from the wordy primordial void there soon arose the blank page, the
toner cartridge and the now ceaseless human craving for print. If
you have a desire to look good in print, or just need to knock out
a memo, term paper or letter to mom, you should know about
<span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span>. groff is a rich yet
accessible set of document formatting tools and is available as
standard equipment on every Linux system. groff can help take your
words and typeset them beautifully on the printed page.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> refers specifically to
the GNU and updated version of
<span   class="bold"><b>troff</b></span> (that venerable document
formatting system developed for UNIX in the prehistoric era, before
the Internet, compact disc and microwave popcorn). Traditional
troff was first written in the early 1970s by Joseph Ossana at Bell
Labs, rewritten a few years later by Brian Kernighan and designed
for the computers and typesetting equipment available at the time.
The GNU version of troff&mdash;first called
<span   class="bold"><b>gtroff</b></span>, now simply groff&mdash;was
written in the early 1990s by James Clark. While remaining
compatible with traditional troff, groff offers several key
enhancements making it easier to use, more powerful and containing
fewer limitations than the program it supersedes. GNU groff is
actively maintained and continues to evolve. In addition to Linux
and other UNIX/UNIX-like systems, ports of groff are available for
most of the other platforms out there. This ubiquity and
open-source freedom lets you publish and share your documents
portably and freely among platforms.</p><p>Using groff's macro capabilities for generating printed
output is the focus of this article. It should also be mentioned
that groff serves as the formatting engine for the on-line manual
pages produced by the <span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> command.
If you need a sample of the typesetting prowess of groff, simply
generate a printed manual page with the <b  >-t</b>
option to man:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
man -t troff &gt;troff.man.ps
</pre><p>This will produce a PostScript version of the manual page for
groff, which you can then view on-screen with one of the PostScript
previewers (<span   class="bold"><b>gv, mgv</b></span>), print
directly with a PostScript printer or print to a non-PostScript
printer using a PostScript interpreter such as GhostScript. (You
should really take a look at this man page, by the way. It provides
a thorough summary of all the additional features available in GNU
groff, with more detail than presented here.)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> offers all the
niceties of computerized typesetting, including automatic
ligatures, kerning, hyphenation and end-of-sentence spacing. groff
also provides low-level control over all aspects of page layout by
means of typesetting commands embedded into an otherwise plain text
file. Most often these commands&mdash;or, in groff parlance,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>requests</em></span>&mdash;are specified with a period in the
first column of the line containing the command. For example, the
following snippet of document has embedded commands for increasing
the left indent and decreasing the current line length:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
This is an example of a groff document..in  +0.5i
.ll  -0.5i
When formatted by groff, the text continuing
here will appear indented by one-half inch
from both of the previous margins.
</pre><p>Although it is possible to format a document completely using
such &ldquo;raw&rdquo; groff requests, it is more typical for endusers to
work with a collection of predefined <span   class="emphasis"><em>macros</em></span>
that encapsulate sequences of raw requests into single commands.
For example, if we wanted to create a macro for the block indent
commands in the previous snippet, it might look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.de  Bi.in  +0.5i
.ll  -0.5i
..
</pre>


The <b  >.de</b> request begins the definition of our
macro named <b  >Bi</b>, and the double period on the
last line marks the end. Invoking a macro within a document follows
the same syntax as using a raw request (the name of the macro
follows on a line with a period in the first column). Our new macro
used in a document would look like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
This is another section of my groff document..Bi
Oh boy, now the text continuing here is indented
from both margins!
</pre>


If at some later time we want to increase the block indent to
three-quarters of an inch, we need only change the macro
definition. All instances of <b  >Bi</b> throughout the
document will then format with the new dimensions.
</p><p>So far, we haven't seen a whole lot here to get excited
about. One of the limitations of traditional troff is that the
names of all commands, macros and other variables are limited to
two characters. Two measly characters? As mentioned earlier, troff
was developed in the veritable stone age of computing, when every
bit mattered, and succinctness was sublime. While the developers of
troff and the standard macro packages have done their best to
devise naming schemes that are as mnemonic as possible within this
two-character constraint, the resulting interface is about as
user-friendly as 80x86 assembly language (which at least uses three
characters for most of its instruction set!).</p><p>Fortunately, GNU groff eliminates this two-character naming
limitation. For both the macro developer and the eduser, the</p><p>most significant enhancement of groff is that all names,
including macros, numbers, strings, fonts and environments, can be
of arbitrary length. Groff also allows for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>aliasing</em></span> of troff commands, macros and
variables to provide alternative names for existing ones. We will
exploit this feature heavily through the rest of the article. In
fact, let's begin right now by aliasing the groff alias command
itself:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.als    ALIAS   als
</pre><p>We can now use this command to provide a set of longer names
for other key groff commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS  MACRO    de.ALIAS  NUMBER   nr
.ALIAS  STRING   ds
</pre>


Sure, your old-time, hard-core troff jocks will gnash their teeth
at the syntactic sugar. But the rest of us will have an easier time
figuring out what in Sam Hill some macro is doing when we get back
to work on it after a long and pleasurable weekend&mdash;or some other
lapse into real life.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed0580.0x1fc8df0"></a>Macro Markup</h2></div></div><p>Listing 1 demonstrates an obligatory &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;
program implemented with groff macros. In it we can see that groff
offers commands for creating user-defined variables of type number
and string, and that these can be used within the macros we
develop. Note the addition of more command aliases and number
registers in this more practical example:</p><p><a href="4375l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. &ldquo;Hello World
Program&rdquo;</a></p><pre     class="programlisting">
.\"(this is a traditional troff comment).\"
\# (this is a gnu and improved comment!)
\#
\# define additional aliases:
.ALIAS   BRKFILL     br
.ALIAS   SKIP        sp
.ALIAS   NEED        ne
.ALIAS   TINDENT     ti
\#
\# define number registers:
.NUMBER  #PARINDENT  0.5i
.NUMBER  #PARSKIP    0.8v
.NUMBER  #ORPHANS    2
\#
\# define user interface
\# tag for a new paragraph:
.MACRO  &lt;p&gt;   __END__
.  BRKFILL \" break and spread pending output
.  SKIP    \\n[#PARSKIP]u       \" paragraph prespace
.  NEED    \\n[#ORPHANS]v-1v+1u \" orphan control
.  TINDENT \\n[#PARINDENT]u     \" indent 1st line
.__END__
</pre><p>As may be clear from our selection of alias names and in-line
comments, the macro definition of <b  >&lt;p&gt;</b>
provides a markup tag for a new paragraph with the following
features when formatted by groff:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>completes formatting and forces output of any
pending line currently in process</p></li><li><p>creates vertical prespace for the paragraph to
follow by the value in the <b  >#PARSKIP</b>
variable</p></li><li><p>controls orphans by keeping a minimum of
<b  >#ORPHANS</b> lines together</p></li><li><p>temporarily indents the first line of the paragraph
by the value in the <b  >#PARINDENT</b> variable</p></li></ul></div>

Usage of the new paragraph macro in a document file would look
like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.&lt;p&gt;This is my new paragraph. Notice how groff
lets me create HTML-like tags.
.&lt;p&gt;
Here is my next paragraph...
</pre>


Although this example is simplified from a final implementation, it
demonstrates how we can export a user interface built up from basic
groff macros and create structured markup tags for our documents.
Notice also that another macro file could alternatively define the
&lt;p&gt; macro when publishing the same document to the Web:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.MACRO    &lt;p&gt;    __END__&lt;p&gt;
.__END__
</pre>


A macro name can be any string of any characters, and groff is case
sensitive. In our example named &lt;p&gt;, the angle brackets have
no special meaning; they are just part of the macro name we have
devised to simulate an HTML-like tag.
</p><p>We should, however, expand the definition of the macro given
above. Recall that the <b  >.MACRO</b> command itself is
an alias we have given to the raw groff request
<b  >.de</b>. This command accepts two arguments: the
first is the name of the macro (here <b  >&lt;p&gt;</b>);
the second is an optional termination label (here
<b  >END</b>). Any arbitrary string may be used to mark
the end of a macro definition. We use <b  >END</b> in
these examples, but one could also use &lt;&lt;&lt; or *****, or
any other convention that helps to improve the readability of a
collection of macro commands in a file.</p><p>The <b  >macro</b> also demonstrates different
forms of comments. The first form (.\&ldquo;) with a period in the first
column actually functions as an <span   class="emphasis"><em>undefined
request</em></span>, with the effect that the entire line is
silently ignored. The second form (<b  >\#</b>) is a GNU
groff extension and ignores everything on the line beyond the
comment <span   class="emphasis"><em>including the new_line</em></span>. The third form
(<b  >\"</b>) can be used on the same line as groff
commands and ignores everything on the line beyond the comment,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not including the new_line</em></span>. If one were to use
this last form of comment (<b  >\"</b>) on a line by
itself, and without a period in the first column, groff would
interpret the new_line and generally convert it into a space or new
line (depending on fill mode) in the output. Unintended spaces and
blank lines can be a source of misery and anguish, especially to
the novice macro developer trying to figure out why extra space is
creeping into the document. Generally, the GNU form of comment is
preferable for single-line comments, while the traditional form is
required for comments following on the same line as groff
commands.</p><p>Finally, you probably noticed that while groff command syntax
requires a period in the first column, the name of the command
itself may be indented to any level on the same line. By using
logically indented source code, together with comments, you will
greatly improve the readability of the code for yourself and others
in future generations of groff users to come. (The preceding
comment is a public service announcement as required by the Surgeon
General of Computer Science and is based on extensive scientific
evidence that such conventions will prolong the life expectancy of
your source code.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed0580.0x1fc9aa8"></a>Variables and Name Spaces</h2></div></div><p>Groff has a set of about 50 predefined variables called
number registers. These are the internal gauges of groff's
typesetting machinery. While processing an input file, groff
maintains these registers with the current value of such variables
as page number, position on page and point size. Number registers
are in a separate namespace from strings and macros, and are
aliased with their own alias command, as in the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS  ALIASNR aln.ALIASNR        _PTSIZE .s
.ALIASNR        _LEADING        .v
</pre><p>In this example, we first alias the command for aliasing
numbers, adapting the methodology we used earlier. Then, we alias
the read-only registers for the current point size and vertical
line spacing, choosing to use the traditional typesetting
terminology&mdash;&ldquo;leading&rdquo;&mdash;for the latter. Although not required,
the above example also demonstrates the use of a specific
convention we follow, to prefix aliases for system variables with
an &ldquo;_&rdquo; (underscore character).
</p><p>You can, of course, follow your own heart in these matters.
But the use of a naming convention may help to distinguish the
variables themselves from the names of the commands that set the
variables, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS   PTSIZE   ps.ALIAS   LEADING  vs
</pre><p>These might be used in a macro as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.MACRO    &lt;fontsize:&gt;    __END__.  PTSIZE  \\$1
.  IFELSE  "\\$2""  \{\
.      LEADING ( \\n[_PTSIZE]u * 120/100 )
.  \}
.  ELSE \\{\
.      LEADING  \\$2
.  \}
.__END__
</pre>


With usage in a document:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.&lt;p&gt;A message to the world:
.&lt;p&gt;
.&lt;fontsize:&gt;  18p
Is groff great or what?
</pre>


The first line of the macro sets the current point size to the
value of the first argument to the macro. The second line
introduces a compound if/else statement, using groff's string
comparison syntax for the logical test. If the second argument is
empty, the leading is set by taking the value of the point size now
in the numeric register <b  >_PTSIZE</b>, and increasing
it by 20%. Otherwise, the leading is set to the value provided by
the second argument.
</p><p>Parentheses in a numeric expression permit the use of spaces
within the expression. Otherwise, in the example above, we would
need to use the less legible form without any spaces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.LEADING  \\n[_PTSIZE]u*120/100
</pre><p>Numeric expressions are evaluated simply left to right, there
are no operator precedence rules, and parentheses are required to
explicitly change the order of evaluation.
</p><p>All arithmetic operations and number registers are ultimately
integer based. Groff internally translates all dimensional
measurements into machine units (based on 72,000 units per inch for
PostScript devices), providing a functional &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; of
fractional dimensions and point sizes. This allows us to specify
decimal terms such as <b  >8.5i</b> and
<b  >11.5p</b>, which, in fact, evaluate to 612,000 and
11,500 machine units respectively. Numeric values can be specified
in any of the units shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="4375t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Groff Units</a></p><p>In practice, groff's internal use of integral math can have
significant consequences for the macro developer. Consider what
would happen if the expression above were instead stated:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.LEADING  (\\n[_PTSIZE]u * (120/100))
</pre><p>Using integer division, the parenthetical term of 120/100
would evaluate to one and the entire expression would then evaluate
to the current point size, and not 20% larger as intended.
</p><p>As it turns out, not all predefined number registers are, in
fact, numeric. For example, the name of the current file being
processed is in the read-only register
<b  >.F</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS     MESSAGE  tm.ALIASNR   _LINE    .c
.ALIASNR   _FILE    .F
.MESSAGE  Currently processing file \n[_FILE], line \n[_LINE].
</pre><p>Although both variables are evaluated using the syntax for
number registers, _FILE returns the name of the current file as a
string. Despite this anomaly, groff permits only numeric
expressions in user-defined number registers. The example here, by
the way, is one means of inserting debugging messages in your macro
file during development. The <b  >.tm</b>
request&mdash;aliased above to <b  >.MESSAGE</b>&mdash;sends any
text that follows to the standard error stream.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed0580.0x1fc0cd8"></a>Macros and &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; Mode</h2></div></div><p>Observant readers may be wondering why the syntax for
evaluating the number registers inside the
<b  >&lt;p&gt;</b> macro have two backslashes (e.g.,
<b  >\\n[#PARSKIP]u</b>), rather than one (e.g.,
<b  >\n[_LINE]</b>) as are shown above. The difference is
subtle but important.</p><p>The reason for using two backslashes inside macro definitions
is that we usually don't want the expression inside the macro to be
evaluated at the time the macro is first read. Rather, we would
like the expression to be evaluated every time the macro is played
back. A double backslash is groff's escape sequence for the
backslash character itself, providing the means of getting a single
backslash to print in your output. When groff is reading in a macro
for the first time&mdash;in what is called &ldquo;copy mode&rdquo;&mdash;it interprets
everything as it usually does, including escape sequences. So when
a double backslash is encountered in a macro definition, groff
converts it to the single backslash the sequence represents. Then,
whenever the macro is played back, the single backslash remaining
is interpreted in the usual manner.</p><p>Although we could define macro variables with a single
backslash, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.MACRO   &lt;p&gt;.SKIP   \n[#PARSKIP]u
\# etcetera
</pre><p>This macro would always execute with the amount of paragraph
prespace specified in the variable <b  >#PARSKIP</b> at
the time the macro was first read. You would be stuck with the same
<b  >#PARSKIP</b> for your whole document. By using two
backslashes, as in our original definition of
<b  >&lt;p&gt;</b>, we can dynamically change the
<b  >#PARSKIP</b> variable anywhere in the document and
as often as we like, for example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
\# user interface for setting parskip:.MACRO  &lt;parskip:&gt;    __END__
.    NUMBER  #PARSKIP  \\$1
.__END__
\#
\# tighten spacing between paragraphs:
.&lt;parskip:&gt;  0.4v
</pre>


The new setting will now affect the format of all instances of the
<b  >&lt;p&gt;</b> macro that follow.
</p><p>As we could expect, groff offers a useful extension in this
area as well. The &ldquo;<b  >\E</b>&rdquo; sequence represents an
escape character that will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be interpreted
in copy mode. So, our <b  >&lt;p&gt;</b> macro could just
as easily be written:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.MACRO  &lt;p&gt;.SKIP   \En[#PARSKIP]u
\# etcetera
</pre><p>The &ldquo;<b  >\E</b>&rdquo; sequence will provide the same
result as the &ldquo;<b  >\\</b>&rdquo; double backslash sequence.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed0580.0x1fc1518"></a>Pseudo-Arrays and Real Loops</h2></div></div><p>We have shown above that the groff syntax for evaluating a
number register with names of arbitrary length is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\n[anyname]
</pre><p>Similarly, the syntax for evaluating other registers is
<pre     class="programlisting">
\*[anyname]    string\f[anyname]    font
\[anyname]     special character
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> only has scalar variables,
lacking compound structures or subscripted arrays. But it is
possible to combine definitions and numeric variables in such a way
as to fake the effects of compound data types. Here, we will
demonstrate a &ldquo;pseudo-array&rdquo; that may come in handy for your bag
of macro tricks.
</p><p>Consider the following string definitions for days of the
week:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.STRING  $DAYNAME1   Sunday.STRING  $DAYNAME2   Monday
\# etcetera
.STRING  $DAYNAME7   Saturday
</pre><p>groff provides a number register representing the current day
of the week as a numeric value <b  >1</b> through
<b  >7</b>, and, of course, we alias it again to fit in
with our scheme:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIASNR  _DOW    dw
</pre>


Now, we can initialize a variable with the current dayname using
the pseudo-array of strings we defined above as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.STRING  $TODAY  \*[$DAYNAME\n[_DOW]]
</pre>


Anytime we need the name of the current day in a macro or document,
we need only use the string variable <b  >$TODAY</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness it's \*[$TODAY].
</pre>


Human reaction to this message will likely be most favorable when
the <b  >_DOW</b> variable evaluates to
<b  >6</b>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> also has an extension
that enables the use of looping constructs within macros. Together
with pseudo-arrays, this feature gives you considerably more power
and flexibility over traditional troff, which only has if/else
branching logic. Following the example above, if you needed a macro
to create a header for a list of tab-separated columns for each
weekday, (Monday through Friday) you might cobble up something like
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS  TABSET    ta.ALIAS  WHILE     while
.MACRO  &lt;weekdays&gt;    __END__
.  NUMBER  IX  1 1
.  NOFILL
.  TABSET  T  .75iC
.  WHILE  \\n[IX]&lt;6  \{\
        \\*[$DAYNAME\\n+[IX]]\c
.  \}
.  FILL
.__END__
</pre><p>In the example above, the <b  >TABSET</b> command
makes use of groff's &ldquo;<b  >T</b>&rdquo; extension for
repeating tabs, set here every 3/4 of an inch. The loop test
variable, &ldquo;IX&rdquo;, demonstrates the auto-increment syntax with a
number register (the &ldquo;<b  >+</b>&rdquo; sign in the
<b  >\\n+[IX]</b> expression). This has the effect of
preincrementing the variable, so the first time through the loop
<b  >IX</b> will evaluate as 2, printing &ldquo;Monday&rdquo; from
the pseudo-array <b  >$DAYNAME</b>. Finally, the printed
line is terminated with the <b  >\c</b> escape sequence,
to continue output on the current line without inserting the new
line that would otherwise be inserted in nofill mode.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span>'s implementation of
&ldquo;while loops&rdquo; includes <b  >.break</b> and
<b  >.continue</b> statements. These give groff more of
the flow-of-control facilities of a complete programming language.
Although you probably won't be using groff for solving multiple
regression problems, groff's while loops do make it easier to write
macros for, say, printing columns of address labels on precut
forms, without using an external processor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ed0580.0x1fc2070"></a>Page Layout and Traps</h2></div></div><p>The basic page layout model for groff is in keeping with
groff's minimalism. The only dimensions groff requires are the
vertical length of the page, the hard left margin and the
horizontal length available for printable lines. Each of these
dimensions is set with its own request that we alias below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.ALIAS    PGLENGTH    pl.ALIAS    PGOFFSET    po
.ALIAS    LNLENGTH    ll
</pre><p>Usually, though, we need a document to have other layout
parameters, such as a top and bottom margin, possibly with running
headers and/or footers. All these may be configured using groff's
<span   class="bold"><b>trap</b></span> mechanism in combination with
additional parameters and macros for the page transition that we
devise.
</p><p>Let's imagine that we would like a top and bottom margin of
one inch for our main body text and a centered page number one-half
inch from the bottom of every page. In addition, we want to define
these parameters so they will work whether we are using letter,
legal or A4 sized paper. The first step is to define our own set of
number registers to hold all of our layout parameters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\# parameters with default settings:.NUMBER    #PAGELENGTH   11.0i
.NUMBER    #PAGEWIDTH     8.5i
.NUMBER    #LEFTMARGIN    1.0i
.NUMBER    #RIGHTMARGIN   1.0i
.NUMBER    #TOPMARGIN     1.0i
.NUMBER    #BOTMARGIN     1.0i
.NUMBER    #FOOTMARGIN    0.5i
\#
\# layout initialization macro:
.MACRO  SET_LAYOUT    __END__
.    PGLENGTH  \\n[#PAGELENGTH]u
.    PGOFFSET  \\n[#LEFTMARGIN]u
.    LNLENGTH \
\\n[#PAGEWIDTH]u-\\n[#LEFTMARGIN]u-\\n[#RIGHTMARGIN]u
.__END__
\#
\# initialize layout with defaults:
.SET_LAYOUT
</pre><p>The next step is to write our page transition macros and put
them into position with the trap mechanism. The following snippet
demonstrates:
<pre     class="programlisting">
\# some more aliases:.ALIAS  CENTER    ce
.ALIAS  RIGHT     rj
.ALIAS  NEWPAGE   bp
.ALIAS  SETTRAP   wh
\#
\# macro for header:
.MACRO  MYHEADER    __END__
'    SKIP  |\\n[#TOPMARGIN]u
.__END__
\#
\# macro for footer:
.MACRO  MYFOOTER    __END__
'    SKIP  |(\\n[#PAGELENGTH]u -
\\n[#FOOTMARGIN]u)
.    CENTER
\\n[_PAGE]
'    NEWPAGE
.__END__
\#
\# position to invoke header/footer:
.SETTRAP  0                  MYHEADER
.SETTRAP  0-\n[#BOTMARGIN]u  MYFOOTER
</pre>


The example shows two macros, <b  >MYHEADER</b> and
<b  >MYFOOTER</b>, which define the actions taken at the
top of the page (position 0) and at the bottom margin
(<b  >-1.0i</b>). The syntax in these macros shows the
deferred break control character, the apostrophe,
<b  >'</b>, used with groff commands that would otherwise
cause the output to be immediately forced out.
</p><p>The page layout parameters are defined with default values,
but here we will create a user-interface for changing the
papersize:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.MACRO  &lt;papersize:&gt;    __END__.    IFELSE  "\\$1"letter"  \{\
.        NUMBER #PAGELENGTH  792p
.        NUMBER #PAGEWIDTH   612p
.    \}
.    ELSE .IFELSE  "\\$1"a4"  \{\
.        NUMBER #PAGELENGTH  842p
.        NUMBER #PAGEWIDTH   595p
.    \}
.    ELSE .IFELSE  "\\$1"legal"  \{\
.        NUMBER #PAGELENGTH  1008p
.        NUMBER #PAGEWIDTH    612p
.    \}
.    ELSE  \{\
.        MESSAGE \
Missing or unrecognized papersize,\
file \\n[_FILE], line \\n[_LINE]
.    \}
.    \" re-initialize layout:
.    SET_LAYOUT
.__END__
</pre><p>The enduser can now set the paper size of the document, which
initializes the margins accordingly. Putting together the elements
we have looked at so far, we have defined an interface to groff
that allows the enduser to create a document that looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.&lt;papersize:&gt;  a4.&lt;fontsize:&gt;   11.5p
.&lt;parskip:&gt;     0.8v
.&lt;p&gt;
This document is typeset by groff!

<span   class="bold"><b>gcc compiler</b></span>, groff is one of the
mainstay classics in the standard UNIX/Linux environment. We have
seen just a few ways of using groff's extensive macro capabilities
to define markup and page layout interfaces that readily turn plain
text files into typeset-quality print.</p><p>The features covered here are by no means the whole story.
For example, groff also includes native facilities for drawing
lines, curves, circles, ellipses and polygons with shaded filling.
And, this does not even begin to cover groff's suite of
preprocessors for graphs (<b  >grap</b>), pictures
(<b  >pic</b>), equations (<b  >eqn</b>),
tables (<b  >tbl</b>) and bibliographic references
(<b  >refer</b>). As is customary with GNU and Linux
software, groff comes with thorough and high-quality documentation.
(See Resources for more information.) And there are, of course,
active mailing lists for staying current with groff and interacting
with its user community.</p><p>This article has been aimed at the creation of short
documents, but groff is capable of printing works of any length. In
fact, groff is likely the typesetter used in the publication of
your favorite O'Reilly title. For tour-de-force examples of groff
in action, not to mention some of the best books on UNIX
programming ever published, see any of the series by W. Richard
Stevens. (The late Dr. Stevens is quoted at the beginning of this
article from his colophon to <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network Programming,
Volume 2</em></span>, Prentice-Hall PTR, 1999.) Much like the C
programming language born of the same era, groff has an enduring
and powerful minimalism that continues to lend itself well to
typesetting tasks of all sizes. And if you should hear of reports
suggesting groff's demise, just remember, some folks used to make
similar claims about UNIX as well!</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Wayne Marshall (guinix@yahoo.com) is a UNIX
