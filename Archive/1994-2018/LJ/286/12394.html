<p>The <a href="https://zenroom.dyne.org">Zenroom</a> project, a brand-new
crypto-language
virtual machine, has reached version 0.5.0. Zenroom's goal is "improving people's
awareness of how their data is
processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create and
publish algorithms that can be used both client and server side." In addition, it
"has no
external dependencies, is smaller than 1MB, runs in less than 64KiB memory and is
ready for experimental use on many target platforms: desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud
and browsers." The program is free software and is licensed under the GNU LGPL v3.
Its main use case is "distributed computing of untrusted code where advanced
cryptographic functions are required".</p></li>

Feral Interactive released GameMode, an open-source tool that helps Linux users
get the best performance out of their games. According to the press release, "GameMode
instructs your CPU to automatically run in Performance Mode when playing games."
<em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>,
which was released in April 2018, will be the first release to integrate this
tool. GameMode is available now via <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode">GitHub</a>.</p></li>

</p><p>Linux kernel developer, free software activist and Google engineer Matthew Garrett
discovered that Symantec is using a Linux distro based on the QCA Software Development
Kit (QSDK) project: "This is a GPLv2-licensed, open-source platform built around the
Linux-based OpenWrt Wi-Fi router operating system" (if true, this means Symantic needs
to share the Norton Core Router's code). So, Garrett <a href="https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/981645615833653248">tweeted</a> "Hi
@NortonOnline the Norton Core is clearly running Linux and the license requires you to
distribute the kernel source code so where can I get it?" (Source: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/symantec-may-violate-linux-gpl-in-norton-core-router/#ftag=RSSbaffb68">ZDNet</a>.)</p></li>

first cross-platform browser for mixed reality. See <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/04/03/mozilla-brings-firefox-augmented-virtual-reality">The

</p><p>The Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/linux-foundation-launches-lf-deep-learning-foundation-accelerate-ai-growth">announced</a>
the launch of the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/deep-learning">LF Deep
Learning Foundation</a>, "an umbrella organization
focused on driving open source innovation in artificial intelligence,
machine learning and deep learning", with a goal of making those
technologies available to data scientists and developers. In addition, the
Linux Foundation also debuted the <a href="https://www.acumos.org">Acumos
AI project</a>, an "open source framework that makes it easy to build,
share, and deploy AI apps".

</p><p>The EFF has questions and advice for Google regarding the company's work on
"Project Maven", which is "a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) initiative to deploy
machine learning for military purposes". Read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/should-google-really-be-helping-us-military-build-ai-systems">"Google
Should Not Help the U.S. Military Build Unaccountable AI Systems"</a> post by Peter

radical proposal to keep personal data safe"</a> in <em>The Guardian</em>:
"The surveillance imposed on us today is worse than in the Soviet Union. We
need laws to stop this data being collected in the first place."
