Nextcloud 13: How to Get Started and Why You Should</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_109">
Nextcloud could be the first step toward replacing proprietary services like
Dropbox and Skype. By Marco Fioretti</h2>


<p>
In its simplest form, the <a href="https://nextcloud.com">Nextcloud</a> server is
"just" a personal, free software alternative to services like Dropbox
or iCloud. You can set it up so your files are always accessible
via the internet, from wherever you are, and share them with your
friends. However, Nextcloud can do so much more.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I first describe what the Nextcloud server is and
how to install and set it up on GNU/Linux systems. Then I explain how to
configure the optional Nextcloud features, which may be the first
steps toward making Nextcloud the shell of a complete replacement for
many proprietary platforms existing today, such as Dropbox, Facebook and Skype.
</p>

    <p class="caption">Figure 1. A safe home for all your data that all your devices can reach—that's what Nextcloud
wants to be.</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_110">
Why Nextcloud and Not ownCloud?</h3>

<p>
Nextcloud, whose version 13 was released in February 2018, was spun off
the popular <a href="https://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a> project in 2016, out of
licensing and other disagreements.
See the Resources section for 
some of the most complete feature-by-feature comparisons between
Nextcloud and ownCloud.
The most
basic capabilities are still almost identical, two years after the
fork. Some of the functions described here, however, are easier to
integrate in Nextcloud than in its ancestor. In addition,
my personal reasons for recommending Nextcloud over ownCloud are the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
Licensing and pricing policies: all the official components of Nextcloud
are both free as in freedom and as in free beer. You pay only for support
and update services. That's not the case with ownCloud.
</li>

<li>
Long-term roadmap: at the moment, ownCloud seems to be more focused
on corporate customers and more relevant for investors, while Nextcloud seems to be more
focused on 
extending "direct" user-to-user communication and cooperation features.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Dropbox like screen" src="12307f2.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 2. The Original
Nextcloud/ownCloud Functions: File and Picture Storage, Dropbox-Style</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_111">
A Word on Security</h3>

<p>
Several good reasons to choose Nextcloud as the online home for your own
files and data are related to security. I don't cover them in detail
in this introductory article, but I want to mention at least some of them.
</p>

<p>
Nextcloud refuses continuous (that is, malicious) attempts
to authenticate from any computer, except those whose IP addresses are
included in "brute-force IP whitelists". (Of course, the best possible
whitelist you can configure is an empty one.)
</p>

<p>
Content Security Policy (CSP), instead, is the way a Nextcloud
server may, for example, tell a browser "if you found this script in,
or linked from, a page from me, do <em>not</em> trust it. It must have been
injected there by some attacker!"
</p>

<p>
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard
for secure, single sign-on (SSO) to web-based applications across
different, independent servers. Nextcloud 13 supports SSO with SAML
natively through a dedicated app. If you log in to your own Nextcloud,
you then can use any service, on any other SAML-enabled website for
which you have access rights, without entering any more credentials.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="SAML configuration" src="12307f3.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3. Configuring SAML for
secure single-sign-on is a delicate process, but the Nextcloud interface makes it simple with plenty of instructions.</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_112">
Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
In order to install Nextcloud, you need basic Linux administration skills,
familiarity with the command line and some patience. Software-wise,
the Nextcloud server is a PHP application that needs a LAMP (Linux,
Apache, MySQL, PHP) or similar software stack to work. You can install
it on almost any box permanently connected to the internet, from bare
metal in a server farm to ordinary web-hosting accounts, or even home-based
minicomputers like the Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<p>
Nextcloud 13 can run in different environments, from shared hosting
accounts to servers using nginx instead of Apache or as an Ubuntu snap
package. The configuration officially recommended (quoting the website)
"for the best compatibility, especially if you plan to use lots of
plugins", is Apache 2.4 or later, and a MySQL or MariaDB database. This
is why I'm describing command-line installation of Nextcloud 13 server
on a computer running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, PHP 7, Apache2 and a MariaDB
10.0 database.
</p>

<p>
The procedure is relatively lengthy to explain, but it's worth it. Nextcloud
has many more features and options than what I describe here,
and you can use it to store some of your most sensitive documents and
data. Therefore, I strongly suggest that before actually exposing it on
the internet, be sure to play with it locally on your home Linux box as much
as you can, even if it means re-installing it from scratch several times.
</p>

<p>
And, there's only one way to do all that testing efficiently: an
installation method that can be entirely automated with a shell script.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_113">
Installation and Initial Configuration</h3>

<p>
First, get <em>all</em> the necessary software, because Nextcloud
13 depends on several packages. In the case of Ubuntu 16.04, the ones
you must install with <code>apt-get</code> are these:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install apache2 mariadb-server 
 ↪libapache2-mod-php7.0
sudo apt-get install php7.0-gd php7.0-json php7.0-mysql 
 ↪php7.0-curl php7.0-mbstring
sudo apt-get install php7.0-intl php7.0-mcrypt php-imagick 
 ↪php7.0-xml php7.0-zip
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
(Don't worry if some of those packages are already installed on your system, <code>apt-get</code>
will just skip to the next one.)
</p>

<p>
After that, download the Nextcloud tarball from the website, unpack
it, and copy it into its own folder under the Web server document root,
which, in this example, is /var/www/html/:

</p>
<pre><code>
tar -xjf nextcloud-13.0.0.tar.bz2
sudo cp -r nextcloud /var/www/html/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_114">
Preparing the Database and Web Servers</h3>

<p>
On Ubuntu 16.04 (and, likely, on most Ubuntu derivatives), the command-line
installation of Nextcloud won't work unless there already is
a MariaDB account that is not root, but does have all the privileges
needed to create new users and databases. Here's how to create such an
account, if needed, with name dbadmin and password dbadminpw (note that mdb is my
own MariaDB prompt, not the default one):

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo mysql -u root
mdb&gt;use mysql;
mdb&gt;CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbadminpw';
mdb&gt;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' 
 ↪WITH GRANT OPTION;
mdb&gt;FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mdb&gt;exit;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Apache, on the other hand, needs a dedicated configuration file, which on Ubuntu
16.04 is /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf, to handle
Nextcloud properly. If your server is example.com, and you want your
Nextcloud available at example.com/nextcloud, that file should look
like this:

</p>
<pre><code>
##########################################################
Alias /nextcloud "/var/www/html/nextcloud/"

# the following two directives are needed for picoCMS

ProxyPass /nextcloud/sites/ http://localhost/nextcloud/
↪index.php/apps/cms_pico/pico/
ProxyPassReverse /nextcloud/sites/ http://localhost/nextcloud/
↪index.php/apps/cms_pico/pico/

&lt;Directory /var/www/html/nextcloud/&gt;
  Options +FollowSymlinks
  AllowOverride All

 &lt;IfModule mod_dav.c&gt;
  Dav off
 &lt;/IfModule&gt;

 SetEnv HOME /var/www/html/nextcloud
 SetEnv HTTP_HOME /var/www/html/nextcloud

&lt;/Directory&gt;
##########################################################
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Once that file is ready, type the following commands at the prompt to enable
the modules that Apache also needs to handle Nextcloud:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod env
sudo a2enmod dir
sudo a2enmod mime
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, here are the commands to type to make the Apache user own the
Nextcloud files, enable the configuration files shown above and, finally,
restart Apache:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/nextcloud/
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf 
 ↪/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/nextcloud.conf
sudo service apache2 restart
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_115">
Actually Installing Nextcloud</h3>

<p>
Once the Web and database servers are ready and the Nextcloud files are
in place, the actual Nextcloud installation may happen entirely by
pointing your browser (in the "local testing" phase I already recommended,
at least) at http://localhost/nextcloud. As promised, however, I'm
going to show you how to continue on the command line.
</p>

<p>
This is possible thanks to a PHP tool called <code>occ</code> (from "ownCloud
console") distributed with Nextcloud. To use <code>occ</code>, move to the nextcloud
base directory, and then, using the Apache server account (www-data, in
this example) to preserve the right permissions on files and folders,
run it as follows:

</p>
<pre><code>
cd /var/www/html/nextcloud/

sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:install --database "mysql" 
 ↪--database-name "mynextcloud"  --database-user "dbadmin" 
 ↪--database-pass "dbadminpw" --admin-user "nextcloudadmin" 
 ↪--admin-pass "nextcloudadminpw"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If everything goes well, <code>occ</code> will exit with a "Nextcloud was successfully
installed" message. At that point, you'll finally be able to log
in to Nextcloud at http://localhost/nextcloud with the admin account
("nextcloudadmin") and password "nextcloudadminpw".
</p>

<p>
Using <code>occ</code>, you also can create users or enable
previously downloaded Nextcloud apps, among other things. The <code>occ</code> equivalent of the GUI
procedure for creating a user named marco in the
mycloudusers group, with display name "Marco F", is:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo -u www-data php occ user:add --display-name="Marco F" 
 ↪--group="mycloudusers" marco
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_116">
Measuring and Optimizing Performances</h3>

<p>
Nextcloud 13 has a tab, shown in Figure 4, that gives the administrator
a first, quick idea of how loaded it is. In order to avoid performance
bottlenecks, the easiest solution seems to be the memory cache called OPcache. To
enable it, follow the instructions in the Nextcloud Administration/Basic
Settings tab. You also can install the Redis database for local caching
and file locking. (For details, see <a href="https://autoize.com/tuning-nextcloud-performance">"Tuning Nextcloud for Optimal
Performance"</a>.)
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="CPU Load screen" src="12307f4.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 4. The Nextcloud
13 Real-Time CPU and Memory Load Monitors</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_117">
The Real Power of Nextcloud Is Its Apps</h3>

<p>
If Nextcloud were only a personal alternative to file-hosting services
like Dropbox, it wouldn't be such a big deal. Its real power, however,
is in the many extensions, or "apps", that provide many additional
functions, often through extra buttons in Nextcloud's top bar. Figure
5 shows only a partial idea of how diverse the apps can be.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Nextcloud screen" src="12307f5.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 5. Work, entertainment,
administration, sharing—Nextcloud apps can do a lot.</p>
  </div>

<p>
To use an app not shown in the administration interface, download
and unpack it in the apps subfolder of your Nextcloud installation,
then make the Apache user owner of its files. After that, you just need to
enable the app, with <code>occ</code> or in the Nextcloud interface. 
</p>

<p>
In the Nextcloud interface, you also can enable bundles of
apps with one click or limit access to most apps to selected groups
of users. The app bundles in Nextcloud 13 are Enterprise, Groupware,
Social sharing and an "Education Edition".
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_118">
Beyond Files: Federation, Video Calls and Web Publishing</h3>

<p>
Even if you need it only to host your files online, Nextcloud can
do much more than provide a container for keeping those files.
To begin with, all users of a Nextcloud server can share single
files, or whole folders, with whomever they want by giving them a link,
with or without an associated password. At the same time, a Nextcloud
administrator easily can prevent single apps from sharing files and data,
or it can allow file sharing only inside a group of users.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Nextcloud screen2" src="12307f6.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 6. A detail of how you can share files and folders from your Nextcloud with any other user of other Nextcloud instances.</p>
  </div>

<p>
The really interesting thing, however, is "federation". This name
indicates the capability to connect totally independent installations
of this server in one, seamless "cloud of Nextclouds". It is thanks to
federation that, for example, all your relatives living in different
states can see, each as a local folder of their own Nextcloud server,
the same gallery of photographs that you host inside yours—even if
that folder is not public and none of them has a user account on
your server. Another common usage of federation is merging the user
profiles of several servers in one common address book. This lets all
those users find each other more easily, with their Nextcloud interface
auto-completing the names of the other users when they start typing them.
</p>

<p>
Nextcloud's federation-related features are accessible from the
"Sharing" tab of the administration panel. From there,
with a few clicks, you can define if and how users can share their own
content with other Nextcloud servers, see the folders in those same
servers or access a "global address book".
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Nextcloud screen2" src="12307f7.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 7. Nextcloud recognizes and auto-completes the addresses of all its users and those of any other federated Nextclouds.</p>
  </div>

<p>
That sharing of user directories can happen only with the servers that you
declare "trusted" in the same tab. Synchronization of the local address
book with those of the trusted servers happens with this <code>occ</code> command
that you can put inside a cron job:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo -u www-data php occ federation:sync-addressbooks
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Schedule screen" src="12307f8.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 8. Scheduling appointments
and inviting your fellow Nextcloud users? No problem.</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_119">
Hey Nextcloud, Call My Mother</h3>

<p>
What's the next step after easily sharing pictures with distant family
members or documents with colleagues? Discussing them in an easy-to-use,
privacy-friendly environment, of course.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Video screen" src="12307f9.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 9. Video calls with integrated
chats look really promising in Nextcloud 13.</p>
  </div>

<p>
Integration of the Calendar and users profiles of Nextcloud makes
scheduling online meetings with them a snap. When the time comes, the
Nextcloud Talk app lets you chat, make audio or video calls and share
your screen, without installing any software (except, of course, a
modern browser, or the Nextcloud Android or iOS apps, on one's desktop
or smartphone).
</p>

<p>
Both chats and calls are peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted, without
embedded advertising, or any central organization logging everything. Oh,
and users get instant notifications, in their browsers or in the mobile
apps, whenever other users want to talk with them, or have commented on
some file they shared.
</p>

<p>
Now do you see why I say that Nextcloud, and its federation, may be
the first step toward replacing proprietary platforms, from
Dropbox to Skype?
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_120">
Blogging with Nextcloud</h3>

<p>
Online self-publishing for the masses, via blogs or social networks,
is one of the greatest features (and sometimes problems, of course)
of the current, still open web. The Nextcloud 13 server provides an easy,
if basic way to do this by integrating <a href="http://picocms.org">picoCMS</a>, the pico Content
Management System.
</p>

<p>
picoCMS creates websites by rendering as HTML, with menus and all, all
the Markdown plain-text files (with .md extension) that it finds inside
some predefined folder. In Nextcloud, the best tool to edit .md files
is the Markdown Editor app, so enable it if you decide to use picoCMS.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Index screen" src="12307f10.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 10. The Nextcloud Markdown
editor, with its optional live preview of what you type.</p>
  </div>

<p>
Nextcloud users can independently define, in the picoCMS tab of
the "Settings" interface, both the folder that contains the source
files and the name of the website. Running on your own computer,
the Apache configuration shown here would make Nextcloud serve
the home page of a picoCMS website called "ljdemo" at the URL
http://localhost/nextcloud/sites/ljdemo/.
</p>

<p>
To let all the users of your Nextcloud create inside it all the
picoCMS websites they want, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico">download</a> the compressed
archive of the app, and unpack it on the computer
running Nextcloud. Then move the resulting folder (cms_pico) inside the
apps subfolder of Nextcloud, change its permission, and enable it with
these three commands:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo mv -i cms_pico              /var/www/html/nextcloud/apps/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data  /var/www/html/nextcloud/apps/cms_pico
sudo -u www-data php occ app:enable cms_pico
cms_pico enabled
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
(Of course, you even can put these commands into a script to make
re-installations quicker!) 
</p>

<p>
The next step is to tell the Apache Web
server how to cooperate with picoCMS. The meaning of the two "ProxyPass"
directives in the nextcloud.conf file already shown is this:
"whenever a browser asks for an URL in the /nextcloud/sites/ subfolder,
pass that URL to picoCMS, and then pass to the browser whatever you get
in return".
</p>

<p>
Note that those ProxyPass settings make picoCMS publish
as websites only what it finds in certain folders of Nextcloud. They do not
generate clean, short URLs for all the pages of those websites. To get
that, you must adapt the <code>MOD_REWRITE</code> suggestions contained in the
Administration→picoCMS tab of the Nextcloud panel to your specific
Apache configuration.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_121">
How to Write and Publish a Web Page with Nextcloud and picoCMS</h3>

<p>
Once it's up and running, publishing a web page in a Nextcloud/picoCMS
environment is surely not as simple as it would be with systems like
WordPress.
</p>

<p>
For example, the only way to add new Markdown files in any Nextcloud
folder, except uploading them from your desktop, seems to be to copy and
rename an already existing one. To insert a figure in a post, instead,
you must separately upload it in the asset" subfolder, and then point
to it in the Markdown source, as shown below.
</p>

<p>
If these annoyances are not an issue for you, you may really
like the Nextcloud/picoCMS flow. The Markdown editor and its
integrated preview work great, and whatever you write instantly
goes online. As a practical example, here's 
the source code, preview and rendering, at the local address
http://localhost/nextcloud/sites/ljdemo/testing/ of this index.md file
placed in the Nextcloud folder ljdemo/content/testing/:

</p>
<pre><code>

What Next? A Lot!</h3>

<p>
Nextcloud seems to be a great platform for integrating online services of
all kinds. In this article, I explained how to set it up and tried to
provide an idea of its flexibility, but there is much more you could
do with it. In future articles, I plan to cover
how to integrate with Nextcloud email, secure browsing with Let's Encrypt
and collaborative editing with Etherpad. Stay tuned!
