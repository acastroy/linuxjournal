Data Privacy: Why It Matters and How to Protect Yourself</h1>


<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_54">
When it comes to privacy on the internet, the safest approach is
to cut your Ethernet cable or power down your device. But,
because you can't really do that and remain somewhat productive, you
need other options. This article provides a general overview of the situation, steps
you can take to mitigate risks and
finishes with an OpenVPN tutorial to address basic privacy concerns. By
Petros Koutoupis</h2>

<p>
Sometimes when you're not too careful, you increase your risk
of exposing more information than you should, and often to the wrong
recipients—Facebook is a prime example. The company providing
the social-media product of the same name has been under
scrutiny recently and for good reason. The point wasn't that Facebook 
directly committed the atrocity, but more that a company linked to the
previous US presidential election was able to access and inappropriately
store a large trove of user data from the social-media site. This data 
then was used to target specific individuals. How did it happen though? And
what does that mean for Facebook (and other social-media) users?
</p>

<p>
In the case of Facebook, a data analysis firm called
Cambridge Analytica was given permission by the social-media site to
collect user data from a downloaded application. This data included 
users' locations, friends and even the content the users "liked".
The application supposedly was developed to act as a personality test,
although the data it mined from users was used for so much more and
in what can be considered not-so-legal methods.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="phone crunch" src="12358c.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption"></p>
  </div>

<p>
At a high level, what does this all mean? Users allowed a third party
to access their data without fully comprehending the implications. That
data, in turn, was sold to other agencies or campaigns, where it was
used to target those same users and their peer networks. Through
ignorance, it becomes increasingly easy to "share" data and do
so without fully understanding the consequences.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_55">
Getting to the Root of the Problem</h3>

<p>
For some, deleting your social-media account may not be an option. Think
about it. By deleting
your Facebook account, for example, you may essentially be deleting the 
platform that your family and friends choose to share some of the
greatest events in their lives. And although I continue to throw Facebook in
the spotlight, it isn't the real problem. Facebook merely is taking
advantage of a system with zero to no regulations on how user privacy
should be handled. Honestly, we, as a society, are making up these rules
as we go along.
</p>

<p>
Recent advancements in this space have pushed for additional
protections for web users with an extra emphasis on privacy. Take the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example. Established by the European Union (EU), the 
GDPR is a law directly affecting data protection
and privacy for all individuals within the EU. It also addresses the
export or use of said personal data outside the EU, forcing other
regions and countries to redefine and, in some cases, reimplement their
services or offerings. This is most likely the reason why you may be
seeing updated privacy policies spamming your inboxes.
</p>

<p>
Now, what exactly does GDPR enforce? Again, the primary objective of GDPR
is to give EU citizens back control of their personal data. The compliance
deadline is set for May 25, 2018. For individuals, the GDPR ensures that
basic identity (name, address and so on), locations, IP addresses,
cookie data, health/genetic data, race/ethnic data, sexual orientation and
political opinions are always protected. And once the official deadline
hits, it initially will affect companies with a presence in an EU country
or offering services to individuals living in EU countries. Aside from
limiting the control a company would have over your private data, the GDPR
also places the burden on the same company to be more upfront and honest
with any sort of data breach that could have resulted in the same data
from being inappropriately accessed.
</p>

<p>
Although recent headlines have placed more focus around social-media sites,
they are not the only entities collecting data about you. The very same
concepts of data collection and sharing even apply to the applications
installed on your mobile devices. Home assistants, such as 
Google Home or Amazon Alexa, constantly are listening. The companies
behind these devices or applications stand by their claims that it's
all intended to enrich your experiences, but to date, nothing
prevents them from misusing that data—that is, unless other regions
and countries follow in the same footsteps as the EU.
</p>

<p>
Even if those companies harvesting your data don't ever misuse it, there
is still the risk of a security breach (a far too common occurrence)
placing that same (and what could be considered private) information
about you into the wrong hands. This potentially could lead to far more
disastrous results, including identity theft.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_56">
Where to Start?</h3>

<p>
Knowing where to begin is often the most difficult task. Obviously, use strong
passwords that have a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers and
punctuation, and don't use the
same password for every online account you have. If
an application offers two-factor authentication, use it. 
</p>

<p>
The next step involves reviewing the settings of all your social-media accounts. Limit
the information in your user profile, and also
limit the information you decide to share in your posts, both public
and private. Even if you mark a post as private, that doesn't
mean no one else will re-share it to a more public audience. Even
if you believe you're in the clear, that data eventually could leak
out. So, the next time you decide to post about legalizing marijuana or
"like" a post about something extremely political or polarizing,
that decision 
potentially could impact you when applying for
a new job or litigating a case in court—that is, anything requiring
background checks. 
</p>

<p>
The information you do decide to share in your user profile or in your
posts doesn't stop with background checks. It also can be used to
give unwanted intruders access to various non-related accounts. For
instance, the name of your first pet, high school or
the place you met your spouse easily can be mined from your social-media accounts, and
those things often are used as security questions for vital
banking and e-commerce accounts.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_57">
Social-Media-Connected Applications</h3>

<p>
Nowadays, it's easy to log in to a new application using your social-media accounts.
In some cases, you're coerced or tricked into
connecting your account with those applications. Most, if not all,
social-media platforms provide a summary of all the applications
your account is logged in to. Using Facebook as an example, navigate to
your Settings page, and click the Apps
Settings page. There you will find such a list (Figure 1). 
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Facebook screen" src="12358f1.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 1. The Facebook Application
Settings Page</p>
  </div>

<p>
As you can see in Figure 1, I'm currently connected to a few accounts, 
including the Linux Foundation and Super Mario Run. These applications
have direct access to my account information, my timeline, my contacts
and more.
</p>

<p>
Applications such as these don't automatically
authenticate you with your social-media account. You need to 
authorize the application specifically to authenticate you by that account. And
even though you may have agreed to it at some point, be sure to 
visit these sections of your assorted accounts routinely and review
what's there. 
</p>

<p>
So, the next time you are redirected from that social-media site and
decide to take that personality quiz or survey to determine what kind
of person you are attracted to or even what you would look like as the opposite
sex, think twice about logging in using your account. By doing so, you're
essentially agreeing to give that platform access to everything stored in
your account.
</p>

<p>
This is essentially how firms like Cambridge Analytica 
obtain user information. You 
never can be too sure of how that information will be used or misused.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_58">
Tracking-Based Advertisements</h3>

<p>
The quickest way for search engines and social-media platforms to make
an easy dollar is to track your interests and specifically
target related advertisements to you. How often do you search for
something on Google or peruse through Facebook or Twitter feeds and
find advertisements of a product or service you were looking into the
other day? These platforms keep track of your location,
your search history and your general activities. Sounds scary, huh? In
some cases, your network of friends even may see the products
or services from your searches.
</p>

<p>
To avoid such targeting, you need to 
rethink how you search the internet. Instead of Google,
opt for something like DuckDuckGo. With online stores like Amazon,
keep your wish lists and registries private or share them with a select
few individuals. In the case of social media, you probably should update
your Advertisement Preferences.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Facebook screen" src="12358f2.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 2. The Facebook
Advertisement Preferences Page</p>
  </div>
<p>
In some cases, you can completely disable targeted advertisements based
on your search or activity history. You also can limit what your network
of peers can see.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_59">
Understanding What's at Risk</h3>

<p>
People often don't think about privacy matters until something affects
them directly. A good way to understand what personal data you risk is to request
that same data from a service provider. It is this exact data
that the service provider may sell to third parties or even allow
external applications to access.
</p>

<p>
You can request this data from Facebook, via the General
Account Settings page. At the very bottom of your general
account details, there's a link appropriately labeled "Download a copy of your Facebook
data".
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Facebook screen" src="12358f3.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3. The Facebook
Account Settings Page</p>
  </div>

<p>
It takes a few minutes to collect everything and compress it into
a single .zip file, but when complete, you'll receive an email with a
direct link to retrieve this archive.
</p>

<p>
When extracted, you'll see a nicely organized collection of all your
assorted activities:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ls -l
total 24
drwxrwxr-x 2 petros petros 4096 Mar 24 07:11 html
-rw-r--r-- 1 petros petros 6403 Mar 24 07:01 index.htm
drwxrwxr-x 8 petros petros 4096 Mar 24 07:11 messages
drwxrwxr-x 6 petros petros 4096 Mar 24 07:11 photos
drwxrwxr-x 3 petros petros 4096 Mar 24 07:11 videos
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Open the file index.html at the root of the directory (Figure 4).
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Facebook screen" src="12358f4.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 4. The Facebook
Archive Profile Page</p>
  </div>

<p>
Everything, and I mean <em>everything</em>, you have done with this account
is stored and never deleted. All of your Friends history, including
blocked and removed individuals is preserved. Every photograph and
video uploaded and every private message sent via Messenger is forever
retained. Every advertisement you clicked (and in turn every advertiser
that has your contact information) and possibly even more is recorded. I don't even
know 90% of the advertisers appearing on my list, nor have I ever agreed to
share information with them. I also can tell that a lot of them
aren't even from this country. For instance, why does a German division
of eBay have my information through Facebook when I use the United States
version of eBay and always have since at least 1999?
Why does Sally Beauty care about who I am? Last time I checked, I don't
buy anything through that company (I am not real big into cosmetics or
hair-care products).
</p>

<p>
It's even been reported that when Facebook is installed
on your mobile device, it can and will log all details pertaining to
your phone calls and text messages (names, phone numbers, duration
of call and so on).
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_60">
Mobile Devices</h3>

<p>
I've already spent a great deal of time focusing on social media, but
data privacy doesn't end there. Another area of concern is
around mobile computing. It doesn't matter which mobile operating
system you are running (Android or iOS) or which mobile hardware
you are using (Samsung, Huawei, Apple and so on). The end result is the
same. Several mobile applications, when installed,
are allowed unrestricted access to more data than necessary.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, I went to the Google Play store and looked up the
popular Snapchat app. Figure 5 shows a summary of everything
Snapchat needed to access.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Facebook screen" src="12358f5.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 5. 
Access Requirements for a Popular Mobile Application</p>
  </div>

<p>
A few of these categories make sense, but some of the others leave you
wondering. For instance, why does Snapchat need to know about
my "Device ID &amp; call information" or my WiFi and Bluetooth connection
information? Why does it need to access my SMS text messages? What do
applications like Snapchat do with this collected data? Do they find
ways to target specific products and features based on your history
or do they sell it to third parties?
</p>

<p>
Mobile devices often come preinstalled with software or
preconfigured to store or synchronize your personal data with a back-end
cloud storage service. This software may be provided by your cellular
service provider, the hardware product manufacturer or even by the
operating system developer. Review those settings and
disable anything that does not meet your standards. Even if you rely on
Google to synchronize your photographs and videos to your Google Drive or
Photos account, restrict which folders or subdirectories are synchronized.
</p>

<p>
Want to take this a step further? Think twice about enabling fingerprint
authentication. Hide all notifications on your lock screen. Disable
location tracking activity. Encrypt your phone.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_61">
What about Local Privacy?</h3>

<p>
There is more. You also need to consider local privacy. There is a
certain recipe you always should follow.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Passwords</strong></p>

<p>
Use good passwords.
Do not enable auto-login, and also disable
root logins for SSH. 
Enable your screen lock when the system is idle for a set time and when
the screensaver takes over.
</p>

<p><strong>
Encryption</strong></p>

<p>
Encrypting your home directory or even the entire disk drive limits the
possibility that unauthorized individuals will gain access to your
personal data while physically handing the device. Most modern Linux
distributions offer the option to enable this feature 
during the installation process. It's still possible to encrypt an
existing system, but before you decide to undertake this often risky
endeavor, make sure you first back up anything that's considered
important.
</p>

<p><strong>
Applications</strong></p>

<p>
Review your installed applications. Keep things to a minimum. If you don't
use it, uninstall it. This can help you in at least three ways:
</p>

<ol><li>
It will reduce overall clutter and free up storage space on your local hard
drive.</li>

<li>
You'll be less at risk of hosting a piece of software with bugs or security
vulnerabilities, reducing the potential of your system being compromised in some form
or another.</li>

<li>
There is less of a chance that the same software application is collecting data that
it shouldn't be collecting in the first place.
</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>
System Updates</strong></p>

<p>
Keep your operating system updated at all times. Major Linux distributions
are constantly pushing updates to existing packages that address both
software defects and security vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p><strong>
HTTP vs. HTTPS</strong></p>

<p>
Establish secure connections when browsing the internet. Pay attention
when transferring data. Is it done over HTTP or HTTPS? (The latter 
is the secured method.) The last thing you need is for your login
credentials to be transferred as plain text to an unsecured website. That's why so many service providers are securing your platforms for HTTPS,
where all requests made are encrypted.
</p>

<p><strong>
Web Browsers</strong></p>

<p>
Use the right web browser. Too many web browsers are less
concerned with your privacy and more concerned with your experience. Take
the time to review your browsing requirements, and if you need to run in
private or "incognito" mode or just adopt a new browser more focused
on privacy, take the proper steps to that.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Add-ons</strong></p>

<p>
While on the topic of web browsers, review
the list of whatever add-ons are installed and configured. If an add-on
is not in use or sounds suspicious, it may be safe to disable or
remove it completely. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Script Blockers</strong></p>

<p>
Script blockers (NoScript,
AdBlock and so on) can help by preventing scripts embedded on websites from
tracking you. A bit of warning: these same programs can and may
even ruin your experiences with a large number of websites visited.
</p>

<p><strong>
Port Security</strong></p>

<p>
Review and refine your firewall rules. Make sure you drop anything coming
in that shouldn't be intruding in the first place. This may even be
a perfect opportunity to discover what local services are listening on
external ports (via <code>netstat -lt</code>). If you find that these
services aren't necessary, turn them off.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_62">
Securing Connections</h3>

<p>
Every device connecting over a larger network is associated with a unique
address. The device obtains this unique address from the networking
router or gateway to which it connects. This address commonly is referred to
as that device's IP (internet protocol) address. This IP address is
visible to any website and any server you visit. You'll 
always be identified by this address while using this device.
</p>

<p>
It's through this same address that you'll find advertisements
posted on various websites and in various search engines rendered in the
native language of the country in which you live. 
Even if you navigate
to a foreign website, this method of targeting ensures that the
advertisements posted on that site cater to your current location.
</p>

<p>
Relying on IP addresses also allows some websites or services to restrict
access to visitors from specific countries. The specific range of the
address will point to your exact country on the world map.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_63">
Virtual Private Network</h3>

<p>
An easy way to avoid this method of tracking is to rely on the use of
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It is impossible to hide your
IP address directly. You wouldn't be able to access the internet without it. You
can, however, pretend you're using a different IP address, and this
is where the VPN helps.
</p>

<p>
A VPN extends a private network across a public network by enabling its
users to send/receive data across the public network as if their device
were connected directly to the private network. There exists hundreds
of VPN providers worldwide. Choosing the right one can be challenging,
but providers offer their own set of features and limitations,
which should help shrink that list of potential candidates.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you don't want to go with a VPN provider but instead want to
configure your own VPN server. Maybe that VPN server is located somewhere
in a data center and nowhere near your personal computing device. For this example,
I'm using Ubuntu Server 16.04 to install
OpenVPN and configure it as a server. Again, this server can be hosted
from anywhere: in a virtual machine in another state or province or even
in the cloud (such as AWS EC2). If you do host it on a cloud instance, be
sure you set that instance's security group to accept incoming/outgoing
UDP packets on port 1194 (your VPN port).
</p>

<p><strong>
The Server</strong></p>

<p>
Log in to your already running server and make sure that all local packages
are updated:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Install the <code>openvpn</code> and <code>easy-rsa</code> packages:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsa
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Create a directory to set up your Certificate Authority (CA)
certificates. OpenVPN will use these certificates to encrypt traffic
between the server and client. After you create the directory, change
into it:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
$ cd ~/openvpn-ca/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Open the vars file for editing and locate the section that
contains the following parameters:

</p>
<pre><code>
# These are the default values for fields
# which will be placed in the certificate.
# Don't leave any of these fields blank.
export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
export KEY_PROVINCE="CA"
export KEY_CITY="SanFrancisco"
export KEY_ORG="Fort-Funston"
export KEY_EMAIL="me@myhost.mydomain"
export KEY_OU="MyOrganizationalUnit"

# X509 Subject Field
export KEY_NAME="EasyRSA"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Modify the fields accordingly, and for the <code>KEY_NAME</code>, let's
define something a bit more generic like "server" Here's an example:

</p>
<pre><code>
# These are the default values for fields
# which will be placed in the certificate.
# Don't leave any of these fields blank.
export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
export KEY_PROVINCE="IL"
export KEY_CITY="Chicago"
export KEY_ORG="Linux Journal"
export KEY_EMAIL="localadmin@example.com"
export KEY_OU="Community"

# X509 Subject Field
export KEY_NAME="server"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Export the variables:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ source vars
NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a rm -rf 
 ↪on /home/ubuntu/openvpn-ca/keys
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Clean your environment of old keys:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ./clean-all
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Build a new private root key, choosing the default options for every field:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ./build-ca
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Next build a new private server key, also choosing the default options
for every field (when prompted to input a challenge password, you won't
input anything for this current example):

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ./build-key-server server
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Toward the end, you'll be asked to sign and commit the
certificate. Type "y" for yes:

</p>
<pre><code>
Certificate is to be certified until Mar 29 22:27:51 2028 
 ↪GMT (3650 days)
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y

1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You'll also generate strong Diffie-Hellman keys:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ./build-dh
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
To help strengthen the server's TLS integrity verification,
generate an HMAC signature:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
So, you've finished generating all the appropriate server keys, but now you
need to generate a client key for your personal machine to connect to the
server. To simplify this task, create this client
key from the same server where you generated the server's keys.
</p>

<p>
If you're not in there already, change into the same
~/openvpn-ca directory and source the same <code>vars</code>
file from earlier:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cd ~/openvpn-ca
$ source vars
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Generate the client certificate and key pair, again choosing the default
options, and for the purpose of this example, avoid setting a
challenge password:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ./build-key client-example
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
As with the server certificate/key, again, toward the end, you'll
be asked to sign and commit the certificate. Type "y" for yes:

</p>
<pre><code>
Certificate is to be certified until Mar 29 22:32:37 2028 
 ↪GMT (3650 days)
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y

1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Change into the keys subdirectory and copy the keys you
generated earlier over to the /etc/openvpn directory:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cd  keys/
$ sudo cp ca.crt server.crt server.key ta.key 
 ↪dh2048.pem /etc/openvpn/
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Extract the OpenVPN sample server configuration file to the
/etc/openvpn directory:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ gunzip -c /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/
↪server.conf.gz |sudo tee /etc/openvpn/server.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Let's use this template as a starting point and apply whatever required
modifications are necessary to run the VPN server application. Using an
editor, open the /etc/openvpn/server.conf file. The fields you're
most concerned about are listed below:

</p>
<pre><code>
;tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file is secret

[ ... ]

;cipher BF-CBC        # Blowfish (default)
;cipher AES-128-CBC   # AES
;cipher DES-EDE3-CBC  # Triple-DES

[ ... ]

;user nobody
;group nogroup
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Uncomment and add the following lines:

You'll need to enable IPv4 packet forwarding via <code>sysctl</code>. Uncomment
the field <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code> in
/etc/sysctl.conf and reload the configuration file:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo sysctl -p
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you're running a firewall, UDP on port 1194 will need to be open at
least to the public IP address of the client machine. Once you do this,
start the server application:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
And if you wish, configure it to start automatically every time the system reboots:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, create the client configuration file. This will be
the file the client will use every time it needs to connect to the VPN
server machine. To do this, create a staging directory, set its
permissions accordingly and copy a client template file into it:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ mkdir -p ~/client-configs/files
$ chmod 700 ~/client-configs/files/
$ cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf 
 ↪~/client-configs/base.conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Open the ~/client-configs/base.conf file in an editor and locate
the following areas:

</p>
<pre><code>
remote my-server-1 1194
;remote my-server-2 1194

[ ... ]

ca ca.crt
cert client.crt
key client.key

[ ... ]

;cipher x
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The variables should look something like this:

</p>
<pre><code>
remote &lt;public IP of server&gt; 1194
;remote my-server-2 1194

[ ... ]

#ca ca.crt
#cert client.crt
#key client.key

[ ... ]

cipher AES-128-CBC
auth SHA256

key-direction 1

# script-security 2
# up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
# down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The remote server IP will need to be adjusted to reflect the public
IP address of the VPN server. Be sure to adjust the cipher while
also adding the <code>auth</code> and the <code>key-direction</code>
variables. Also append the commented <code>script-security</code> and
<code>update-resolv-conf</code> lines. Now, generate the OVPN file:

</p>
<pre><code>
cat ~/client-configs/base.conf \
    &lt;(echo -e '&lt;ca&gt;') \
    ~/openvpn-ca/keys/ca.crt \
    &lt;(echo -e '&lt;/ca&gt;\n&lt;cert&gt;') \
    ~/openvpn-ca/keys/client-example.crt \
    &lt;(echo -e '&lt;/cert&gt;\n&lt;key&gt;') \
    ~/openvpn-ca/keys/client-example.key \
    &lt;(echo -e '&lt;/key&gt;\n&lt;tls-auth&gt;') \
    ~/openvpn-ca/keys/ta.key \
    &lt;(echo -e '&lt;/tls-auth&gt;') \
    &gt; ~/client-configs/files/client-example.ovpn
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You should see the newly created file located in the
~/client-configs/files subdirectory:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ls ~/client-configs/files/
client-example.ovpn
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<strong>The Client</strong></p>

<p>
Copy the OVPN file to the client machine (your personal computing
device). In the example below, I'm connected to my client machine and
using SCP, transferring the file to my home directory:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ scp petros@openvpn-server:~/client-configs/files/
↪client-example.ovpn ~/
client-example.ovpn              100%   13KB  12.9KB/s   00:00
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Install the OpenVPN package:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install openvpn
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If the /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf file exists, open
your OVPN file (currently in your home directory) and uncomment the
following lines:

</p>
<pre><code>
script-security 2
up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Connect to the VPN server by pointing to the client configuration file:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo openvpn --config client-example.ovpn
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
While you're connected, you'll be browsing the internet with the
public IP address used by the VPN server and one that was not assigned
by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Summary</h3>

<p>
How does it feel to have your locations, purchasing habits, preferred
reading content, search history (including health and illness), political
views and more shared with an unknown number of recipients across this
mysterious thing we call the internet? It probably doesn't feel very
comforting. This might be information we typically would not want our closest
family and friends to know, so why would we want strangers to
know it instead? It is far too easy to be complacent and allow such
personal data mining to take place. Retaining true anonymity
while also enjoying the experiences of the modern web is definitely a
challenge. Although, it isn't impossible.
</p>

<p>
I have highlighted some appropriate steps you can take to
reduce your digital footprint on the internet, but this is far from a complete
list. Don't stop here. Do your due diligence and give
yourself the reassurance that when you're using modern technology, you're
accessing it in a safe and secure manner.
