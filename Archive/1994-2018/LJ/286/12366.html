Review: the Librem 13v2</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_33">
The Librem 13—"the first 13-inch ultraportable designed to
protect your digital life"—ticks all the boxes, but is it as good in real life
as it is on paper? By Shawn Powers</h2>

<p>
I don't think we're supposed to call portable computers "laptops"
anymore. There's something about them getting too hot to use safely on your lap,
so now they're officially called "notebooks" instead. I must be a thrill-seeker
though,
because I'm writing this review with the Librem 13v2 directly on my
lap. I'm wearing pants, but apart from that, I'm risking it all for the
collective. The first thing I noticed about the Librem 13? The company
refers to it as a laptop. Way to be brave, Purism!
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_34">
Why the Librem?</h3>

<p>
I have always been a fan of companies who sell laptops (er, notebooks)
pre-installed with Linux, and I've been considering buying a Purism laptop for years.
When our very own Kyle Rankin started working for the company, I figured
a company smart enough to hire Kyle deserved my business, so I ordered
the Librem 13 (Figure 1). And when I ordered it, I discovered I could pay with
Bitcoin, which made me even happier!
</p>

<div class="caption">

    <p class="caption">Figure 1. The 13" Librem 13v2 is the perfect size for taking on the road (photo from
<a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>).</p>
  </div>

<p>
There are other reasons to choose Purism computers too. The company is extremely
focused on privacy, and it goes so far as to have hardware switches that turn
off the webcam and WiFi/Bluetooth radios. And because they're designed for
open-source operating systems, there's no "Windows" key; instead there's a
meta key with a big white rectangle on it, which is called the Purism Key
(Figure 2). On top of all those things, the computer itself is rumored
to be extremely well built, with all the bells and whistles usually 
available only on high-end top-tier brands.
</p>

  </div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_35">
My Test Unit</h3>

<p>
Normally when I review a product, I get whatever standard model the
company sends around to reviewers. Since this was going to be my actual
daily driver, I ordered what I wanted on it. That meant the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
i7-6500U processor, which was standard and not upgradable, and doesn't need to be!
</li>

<li>
16GB DDR4 RAM (default is 4GB).
</li>

<li>
500GB M.2 NVMe (default is 120GB SATA SSD).
</li>

<li>
Intel HD 520 graphics (standard, not upgradable).
</li>

<li>
1080p matte IPS display.
</li>

<li>
720p 1-megapixel webcam.
</li>

<li>
Elantech multitouch trackpad.
</li>

<li>
Backlit keyboard.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The ports and connectors on the laptops are plentiful and well laid
out. Figure 3 shows an "all sides" image from the Purism website. There are
ample USB ports, full-size HDMI, and the power connector is on the side,
which is my preference on laptops. In this configuration, the laptop
cost slightly more than $2000.
</p>

    <img alt="Librem multiple views" src="12366f3.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3. There are lots of ports, but not in awkward places (photo from <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_36">
The Physical Stuff and Things</h3>

<p>
<strong>The Case</strong>
</p>

<p>
The shell of the Librem 13 is anodized aluminum with a black matte
texture. The screen's exterior is perfectly plain, without any logos or
markings. It might seem like that would feel generic or overly bland,
but it's surprisingly elegant. Plus, if you're the sort of person
who likes to put stickers on the lid, the Librem 13 is a blank canvas. The
underside is nearly as spartan with the company name and little else. It
has a sturdy hinge, and it doesn't feel "cheap" in any way. It's hard not
to compare an aluminum case to a MacBook, so I'll say the Librem 13
feels less "chunky" but almost as solid.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Screen</strong>
</p>

<p>
Once open, the screen has a matte finish, which is easy to see and
doesn't have the annoying reflection so prevalent on laptops that
have a glossy finish. I'm sure there's a benefit to a glossy screen,
but whatever it might be, the annoying glare nullifies the benefit for
me. The Librem 13's screen is bright, has a sufficient 1080p resolution, and
it's pleasant to stare at for hours. A few years back, I'd be frustrated
with the limitation of a 1080p (1920x1080) resolution, but as my eyes get
older, I actually prefer this pixel density on a laptop. With a higher-res screen, it's hard to read the letters without jacking up the font
size, eliminating the benefit of the extra pixels!
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Keyboard</strong>
</p>

<p>
I'm a writer. I'm not quite as old-school as Kyle Rankin with his
mechanical PS/2 keyboard, but I am very picky when it comes to what sort
of keys are on my laptop. Back in the days of netbooks, I thought a 93%-sized keyboard would be perfectly acceptable for lengthy writing. I was
horribly wrong. I didn't realize a person could get cramps in their hands,
but after an hour of typing, I could barely pick my nose much less type
at speed.
</p>

<p>
The Librem 13's keyboard is awesome. I won't say it's the best keyboard
I've ever used, but as far as laptops go, it's right near the top of
the pile. Like most (good) laptops, the Librem 13 has Chicklet style
keys, but the subtleties of click pressure, key travel, springiness
factor and the like are very adequate. The Librem 13v2 has a new
feature, in that the keys are backlit (Figure 4). Like most geeks, I'm
a touch typist, but in a dark room, it's still incredibly nice to have
the backlight. Honestly, I'm not sure why I appreciate the backlight so
much, but I've tried both on and off, and I really hate when the keyboard
is completely dark. That might just be a personal preference, but having
the choice means everyone is happy.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Librem Keyboard" src="12366f4.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 4. I don't notice the keyboard after hours of typing, which is what you want in a
keyboard (photo from <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>).</p>
  </div>


<p>
<strong>The Trackpad</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Librem 13 has a huge (Figure 5), glorious trackpad. Since Apple is
known for having quality hardware, it's only natural to compare the Librem
13 to the Macbook Pro (again). For more than a decade, Apple has dominated
the trackpad scene. Using a combination of incredible hardware and silky
smooth software, the Apple trackpad has been the gold standard. Even if
you hate Apple, it's impossible to deny its trackpads have been better
than any other—until recently. The Librem 13v2 has a trackpad that is
100% as nice as MacBook trackpads. It is large, supports "click anywhere" and has multipoint support with gestures. What does all that mean? The things
that have made Apple King of Trackpad Land are available not only on
another company's hardware, but also with Linux. My favorite combination is
two-finger scrolling with two-finger clicking for "right-click". The
trackpad is solid, stable and just works. I'd buy the Librem 13 for
the trackpad alone, but that's just a throwaway feature on the website.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Librem trackpad" src="12366f5.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 5. This trackpad is incredible. It's worth buying the laptop for this feature
alone (photo from <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>).</p>
  </div>

<p>
<strong>The Power Adapter</strong>
</p>

<p>
It might seem like a silly thing to point out, but the Librem 13 uses a
standard 19-volt power adapter with a 5.5mm/2.5mm barrel connector. Why is
that significant? Because I accidentally threw my power supply away with
the box, and I was worried I'd have to special-order a new one. Thankfully,
the dozen or so power supplies I have in my office from netbooks, NUCs and so on fit
the Librem 13 perfectly. Although I don't recommend throwing your
power supply away, it's nice to know replacements are easy to find online
and probably in the back of your tech junk drawer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hardware Switches</strong>
</p>

<p>
I'm not as security-minded as perhaps I should be. I'm definitely not as
security-minded as many <em>Linux Journal</em> readers. I like that the Librem 13
has physical switches that disconnect the webcam and WiFi/Bluetooth. For
many of my peers, the hardware switches are the single biggest selling
point. There's not much to say other than that they work. They physically
switch right to left as opposed to a toggle, and it's clear when the
physical connection to the devices have been turned off (Figure 6). With
the Librem 13, there's no need for electrical tape over the webcam. Plus,
using your computer while at DEFCON isn't like wearing a meat belt at
the dog pound. Until nanobots become mainstream, it's hard to beat the
privacy of a physical switch.
</p>

<div class="caption">
    <img alt="Librem switch" src="12366f6.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 6. It's not possible to accidentally turn these switches on or off, which is
awesome (photo from <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>).</p>
  </div>

<p>
I worried a bit about how the operating systems would handle hardware
being physically disconnected. I thought perhaps you'd need special
drivers or custom software to handle the disconnect/reconnect. I'm
happy to report all the distributions I've tried have handled the
process flawlessly. Some give a pop-up about devices being connected,
and some quietly handle it. There aren't any reboots required, however,
which was a concern I had.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Audio/Video</strong>
</p>

<p>
I don't usually watch videos on my laptop, but like most people, I will
show others around me funny YouTube videos. The audio on the Librem
13 is sufficiently loud and clear. The video subsystem (I mention more
about that later) plays video just fine, even full screen. There is also
an HDMI port that works like an HDMI connection should. Modern Linux
distributions are really good at handling external displays, but every
time I plug in a projector and it just works, my heart sings!
</p>

<p>
</p>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_37">PureOS</h3>
<p></p>

<p>
The Librem 13 comes with Purism's "PureOS" installed out of the box. The
OS is Debian-based, which I'm most comfortable using. PureOS uses
its own repository, hosted and maintained by Purism. One of the main
reasons PureOS exists is so that Purism can make sure there is no closed-source code
or proprietary drivers installed on its computers. Although
the distro includes tons of packages, the really impressive thing is
how well the laptop works without any proprietary code. The "purity"
of the distribution is comforting, but the standout feature is
how well Purism chose the hardware. Anyone who has used Linux laptops
knows there's usually a compromise regarding proprietary drivers and
wrappers in order to take full advantage of the system. Not so with the
Librem 13 and PureOS. Everything works, and works well.
</p>

<p>
PureOS works well, but the most impressive aspect of it is what it
does <em>while</em> it's working. The pre-installed hard drive walks you
through encryption on the first boot. The Firefox-based browser (called
"Purebrowser") uses HTTPS: Everywhere, defaults to DuckDuckGo as
the search engine, and if that's not sufficient for your privacy needs,
it includes the Tor browser as well. The biggest highlight part for me
was that since Purebrowser is based on Firefox, the browsing experience
wasn't lacking. It didn't "feel" like I was running a specialized browser
to protect my identity, which makes doing actual work a lot easier.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_38">
Other Distributions</h3>

<p>
Although I appreciate PureOS, I also wanted to try other options. Not only was
I curious, but honestly, I'm stuck in my ways, and I prefer Ubuntu MATE as
my desktop interface. The good news is that although I'm not certain the
drivers are completely open source, I am sure that Ubuntu installs and works
very well. There are a few glitches, but nothing serious and nothing
specific to Ubuntu (more on those later).
</p>

<p>
I tried a handful of other distributions, and they all worked equally
well. That makes sense, since the hardware is 100% Linux-compatible. There
was an issue with most distributions, which isn't the fault of the
Librem 13. Since my system has the M.2 NVMe as opposed to a SATA SSD,
most installers have a difficult time determining where to install the
bootloader. Frustratingly, several versions of the Ubuntu installer don't
let the manual selection of the correct partition to be chosen either. The
workaround seems to be setting up hard drive partitions manually, which
allows the bootloader partition to be selected. (For the record, it's
/dev/nvme0n1.) Again, this isn't Purism's fault; rather, it's the Linux
community getting up to speed with NVMe drives and EFI boot systems.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_39">
Quirks</h3>

<p>
There are a few oddities with a freshly installed Librem 13. Most of
the quirks are ironed out if you use the default PureOS, but it's worth
knowing about the issues in case you ever switch.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NVMe Thing</strong>
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned, the bootloader problem with an NVMe system is frustrating
enough that it's worth noting again in this list. It's not impossible
to deal with, but it can be annoying.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Backslash Key</strong>
</p>

<p>
The strangest quirk with the Librem 13 is the backslash key. It doesn't
map to backslash. On every installation of Linux, when you try to type
backslash, you get the "less than" symbol. Thankfully, fixing things like
keyboard scancodes is simple in Linux, but it's so strange. I have no
idea how the non-standard scancode slipped through QA, but nonetheless,
it's something you'll need to deal with. There's a <a href="https://forums.puri.sm/t/keyboard-layout-unable-to-recognize-pipe/2022">detailed thread on
the Purism forum</a> that makes fixing the problem simple and permanent.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Trackpad Stuff</strong>
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned before, the trackpad on the Librem 13 is the nicest
I've ever used on a non-Apple laptop. The oddities come with various
distributions and their trackpad configuration software. If your
distribution doesn't support the gestures and/or multipoint settings you
expect, rest assured that the trackpad supports every feature you are likely
to desire. If you can't find the configuration in your distro's setup
utility, you might need to dig deeper.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_40">
The Experience and Summary</h3>

<p>
The Librem 13 is the fastest laptop I've ever used. Period. The
system boots up from a cold start faster than most laptops wake from
sleep. Seriously, it's insanely fast. I ran multiple VMs without any
significant slowdowns, and I was able to run multiple video-intensive
applications without thinking "laptops are so slow" or anything like that.
</p>

<p>
The only struggle I had was when I tried to use the laptop for live
streaming to Facebook using OBS (Open Broadcast Studio). The live
transcoding really taxed the CPU. It was able to keep up, but normally on
high-end computers, it's easier to offload the transcoding to a discrete
video card. Unfortunately, there aren't any non-Intel video systems
that work well without proprietary drivers. That means even though
the laptop is as high-end as they get, the video system works well,
but it can't compare to a system with a discrete NVIDIA video card.
</p>

<p>
Don't let the live streaming situation sour your view of the Librem
13 though. I had to try <em>really</em> hard to come up with something that the
Librem 13 didn't chew through like the desktop replacement it is. And
even with my live streaming situation, I was able to transcode the
video using the absurdly fast i7 CPU. This computer is lightning fast,
and it's easily the best laptop I've ever owned. More than anything,
I'm glad this is a system I purchased and not a "review copy", so I don't have to send it back!
