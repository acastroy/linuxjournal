Re: Getting Started with ncurses</h3>

<p>
I really enjoyed Jim Hall's "Getting Started with ncurses" article in the March 2018
issue. When publishing articles that include code
and compile commands (which I like to try out myself), please include the
code or links to the code required for a successful build. The code for
getradndom_int.c and getrandom_int.h were left out. I could guess at the
code from the description, but including the code would make for a much
more complete article with fully working code to try.
</p>

<p><em>
<strong>Jim Hall replies:</strong> I'm glad you liked the article. Sorry I didn't include
the getrandom_int.c source code.
The <code>getrandom_int()</code> function is a simple wrapper to the Linux
<code>getrandom()</code>
system call, guaranteed to return a positive integer value:</em>

</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;sys/random.h&gt;

int getrandom_int(void)
{
    int rand;

    getrandom(&amp;rand, sizeof(int), GRND_RANDOM);

    if (rand &lt; 0) {
	return (rand * -1);
    } else {
	return (rand);
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<em>And the getrandom_int.h header file simply declares the
<code>getrandom_int()</code>
function:</em>

</p>
<pre><code>
int getrandom_int(void);
</code>
</pre>

Bravo! Standing-O</h3>

<p>
Regarding Doc Searls' inaugural From the Editor (in the March 2018 issue), about
all I can add for now is: Bravo! and a standing ovation.
</p>

<p>
The rebirth of <em>LJ</em> this year, after (just like Mr Twain) "the report of
my death was an exaggeration", has been excellent news in a world often
full of disappointments, and this first, newly reborn issue is a so
welcome proof of this resurrection.
</p>

<p>
In January, upon hearing the good news, I immediately renewed my
subscription and continue to look for ways to lend my active support to
<em>LJ</em>'s mission, and I urge other readers to do the same. In a world full
of lying politicians, self-interested C-suite execs, adtech and other
evil business-models, <em>LJ</em> speaks truth to our common freedoms, rights and
interests. We need it—and need to support it—now more than ever.
</p>

<p>
Thanks so much! Congratulations to Doc, Carlie and the entire
staff/crew of this great magazine! Looking forward to future issues, and a
long run for <em>LJv2</em>!
</p>

<p>
—Lorin
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Doc Searls replies:</strong> Thanks, Lorin. We appreciate your support
enormously.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>In addition to those you name, I'd also like to thank Jill Franklin
for her tireless work putting the magazine together for all these many
years—and for her infinite patience with habitually late writers such
as myself. Katherine Druckman too, for her work at keeping our website up
and running for so long on a shoestring that was about one molecule
thick.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>We're working hard to improve and expand <em>Linux Journal</em> and welcome
all the support we can get.</em></p>

March 2018 From the Editor</h3>

<p>
First I want to say congratulations on the new launch of <em>Linux Journal</em>. I've
been a subscriber from day one.
</p>

<p>
I found Doc's March 2018 From the Editor column informative and interesting. I'd
like to make a suggestion that might help your exposure of the subject and your
effort at an open-source project to reverse the on-line advertising model.
</p>

<p>
Leo Laporte and the TWIT network of shows have three shows that I think should
receive copies of this editorial: This Week In Law (TWIL), This Week in Google
(TWIG) and This Week in Tech (TWIT).
</p>

<p>
Just my two cents.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to many more years of <em>Linux Journal</em> and your new effort in
fixing online advertising,
</p>

<p>

Resurrection</h3>

<p>
Congratulations on being reborn. I just received my second "new" issue, and as
before, I read Doc Searls first thing, only now I don't have to swim all the
way to back. After reading his column, I read through all the letters, and it
occurred to me that without the restrictions of paper, you can publish as much
as you want to. I found that the conversations within the Letters section were
as compelling as anything in the magazine. That's not a knock on the rest of
the magazine; it's just an observation. With that said, welcome back!
</p>

April 2018 Issue</h3>

<p>
Good to see that <em>LJ</em> has returned, and that the April
2018 issue is as good as ever. I've been reading it since 1994 when I
helped to start <a href="http://www.manlug.org">ManLUG</a>, which is still going in the present day.
Since that time I've written for <em>Linux Magazine</em>, <em>Linux User and
Developer</em> and <em>Linux Format</em>. It's been fun.
</p>

<p>
Here's hoping we see many more issues of <em>LJ</em> in the future.

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_9">
Ansible</h3>

<p>
Many thanks to Shawn Powers for his articles about Ansible. I seem to recall
a series not too long ago on the same thing, but these hit at just the
right time for me. As an Ansible newbie, I have run across an
irritation that seems to contradict something in Shawn's January 5
article on the website (see <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ansible-automation-framework-thinks-sysadmin">"Ansible:
the Automation Framework That Thinks Like a Sysadmin"</a>). The most attractive way to escalate privileges, as Shawn
writes (option #4), is to allow passwordless sudo on specific
programs. After figuring out the best way to do that, I discovered
that Ansible doesn't handle it well. It's explained <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/become.html#can-t-limit-escalation-to-certain-commands">here</a>. Disappointing, but it makes sense. Unfortunately, that leaves me with
entering passwords manually or letting my account on target machines
become functionally equivalent to root. That would take away the
security advantage of a separate account, and makes it much easier for
me to make horrible mistakes. Are there better (more secure and yet
still convenient) ways to handle this?
</p>

<p>
By the way, I'm so thankful that <em>LJ</em> is back. I even extended my
subscription (that 99-issue deal from long ago) in support. Looking
forward to what you have in store!
</p>

From Social Media</h3>

<p>
<strong>Wayne McDermott:</strong> I just re-subscribed after a gap of some years. The new
format is great, and I like the idea of the Deep Dives. There seems to be
less of the old-man sysadmin stuff as well, plus no politics! Good work.
</p>

<p>
<strong>U @urisharf:</strong> <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/help-us-cure-online-publishing-its-addiction-personal-data">"...adtech does damage to a brand every time it places
that brand's ad next to fake news or on a crappy publisher's
website."</a>
Kudos to @linuxjournal, whitelisted in my adblocker.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Roberto Carraro @robcar1972:</strong>
Oh, I love the new LJ!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Shawn Powers @shawnp0wers:</strong> Can we PLEASE refer to this as the zombie
issue? At least internally? :D
</p>

<p>
<strong>Josh Wheeler @mantlepro:</strong> Replying to @BryanLunduke @linuxjournal
@Microsoft
Microsoft's involvement in open source probably has more to do with
strategic advantage vs. freedom of the end user from unjust software
tyranny. Their involvement in GNU+Linux is counter-intuitive at best. We
need more copyleft advocates who care about preserving users' freedoms
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stormy Roy @royking3:</strong> 
Replying to @dsearls @linuxjournal and 3 others
The current policy environment has definitely incentivized the growth
of adtech. While the ideas of #CustomerTech or VRM have been around
for decades, why do you think it's yet to go mainstream? It's not a
"technology" problem.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Steve Ketelsen @podfish:</strong>
Just cracked open my first issue of the newly launched @linuxjournal.
Skimming though the PDF, it really feels like the old flavor is back,
and it's jam packed: 181 pages of great content! Welcome back,
friends.
