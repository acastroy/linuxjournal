<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_42">What's New in Kernel Development by Zack Brown</h2>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_43">
Speeding Up Netfilter (by Avoiding Netfilter)</h3>

<p>
<strong>Imre Palik</strong> tried to speed up some of Linux's networking code but was met with stubborn
opposition. Essentially, he wanted networking packets to bypass the
<strong>netfilter</strong> code
unless absolutely necessary. Netfilter, he said, was designed for flexibility at
the expense of speed. According to his tests, bypassing it could speed up the
system by as much as 15%.
</p>

<p>
Netfilter is a piece of infrastructure that gives users a tremendous amount of
power and flexibility in processing and restricting networking traffic. Imre's idea
was that if the user didn't want to filter network packets, the netfilter code
shouldn't even be traversed. He therefore wanted to let users disable netfilter for
any given firewall that didn't need it.
</p>

<p>
There was some initial interest and also some questions about how he'd calculated
his 15% speed increase. <strong>Florian Westphal</strong> tried to reason out where the speedup
might have come from. But <strong>David S. Miller</strong> put his foot down, saying that any
speedup estimates were just guesses until they were properly analyzed via
<strong>perf</strong>.
</p>

<p>
David absolutely refused to apply networking patches without a more reliable
indication that they would improve the situation.
</p>

<p>
Imre explained his testing methods and asserted that they seemed sound to him. But
<strong>Pablo Neira Ayuso</strong> felt that Imre's approach was too haphazard. He said there needed
to be a more generic way to do that sort of testing.
</p>

<p>
David was completely unsatisfied by Imre's tests. Instead of trying to work around
netfilter, even in cases where there were no actual filters configured, he said, the
proper solution was to speed up netfilter so it wouldn't be necessary to bypass it.
David said, "We need to find a clean and generic way to make the netfilter hooks as
cheap as possible when netfilter rules are not in use."
</p>

<p>
<strong>David Woodhouse</strong>, on the other hand, felt that a 15% speedup was a 15% speedup, and
we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
</p>

<p>
But, David M stood firm. The netfilter hooks were the fundamental issue, he said,
and "I definitely would rather see the fundamental issue addressed rather than
poking at it randomly with knobs for this case and that."
</p>

<p>
David W and others started hunting around for ways to satisfy David M without
actually recoding the netfilter hooks. David W suggested having the hooks disable
themselves automatically if they detected that they wouldn't be useful.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately there was no conclusion to the thread, although it seems clear that for
the moment, Imre's code is dead in the water. The problem with that is that 15%
really is 15%, and speedups are good even if they're not perfect. It's conceivable
that no one will come up with a good way to fix netfilter hooks, and that Imre's
patch will receive better testing and more meaningful performance numbers. At that
point, it's possible even David M would say okay.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_44">
Read-Only Memory</h3>

<p>
<strong>Igor Stoppa</strong> posted a patch to allow <strong>kernel memory
pools</strong> to be made read-only.
Memory pools are a standard way to group memory allocations in Linux so
their time
cost is more predictable. With Igor's patch, once a memory pool was made
read-only,
it could not be made read-write again. This would secure the data for good
and
against attackers. Of course, you could free the memory and destroy the
pool. But
short of that, the data would stay read-only.
</p>

<p>
There was not much controversy about this patch. <strong>Kees Cook</strong>
felt that
<strong>XFS</strong> would work
well with the feature. And, having an actual user would help Igor clarify
the usage
and nail down the API.
</p>

<p>
This apparently had come up at a recent conference, and <strong>Dave
Chinner</strong> was ready for
Igor's patch. He remarked, "we have a fair amount of static data in XFS that
we set
up at mount time and it never gets modified after that. I'm not so worried
about
VFS level objects (that's a much more complex issue) but there is a lot of
low
hanging fruit in the XFS structures we could convert to write-once
structures."
</p>

<p>
Igor said this was exactly the kind of thing he'd had in mind.
</p>

<p>
A bunch of folks started talking about terminology and use cases, and
speculated
on further abilities. No one had any negative comment, and everyone was
excited to
get going with it.
</p>

<p>
The thing about a patch like this is that people can use the feature or not.
It helps
them with security, or it costs them nothing. It adds an ability but adds no
complexity to the code. Unless something weird happens, I'd expect this
patch to go
into the kernel as soon as the API stabilizes.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_45">
Working around Intel Hardware Flaws</h3>

<p>
Efforts to work around serious hardware flaws in <strong>Intel</strong>
chips are
ongoing. <strong>Nadav
Amit</strong> posted a patch to improve compatibility mode with respect to
Intel's
<strong>Meltdown</strong>
flaw. Compatibility mode is when the system emulates an older CPU in order
to
provide a runtime environment that supports an older piece of software that
relies
on the features of that CPU. The thing to be avoided is to emulate massive
security holes created by hardware flaws in that older chip as well.
</p>

<p>
In this case, Linux is already protected from Meltdown by use of
<strong>PTI</strong> (page table
isolation), a patch that went into Linux 4.15 and that was subsequently
backported
all over the place. However, like the <strong>BKL</strong> (big kernel lock)
in the old days, PTI is
a heavy-weight solution, with a big impact on system speed. Any chance to
disable
it without reintroducing security holes is a chance worth exploring.
</p>

<p>
Nadav's patch was an attempt to do this. The goal was "to disable PTI
selectively
as long as x86-32 processes are running and to enable global pages
throughout this
time."
</p>

<p>
One problem that Nadav acknowledged was that since so many developers were
actively working on anti-Meltdown and anti-<strong>Spectre</strong> patches,
there was plenty of
opportunity for one patch to step all over what another was trying to do. As
a
result, he said, "the patches are marked as an RFC since they (specifically
the
last one) do not coexist with Dave Hansen's enabling of global pages, and
might
have conflicts with Joerg's work on 32-bit."
</p>

<p>
<strong>Andrew Cooper</strong> remarked, chillingly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Being 32bit is itself sufficient protection
against Meltdown (as long as there is nothing interesting of the kernel's
mapped below
the 4G boundary). However, a 32bit compatibility process may try to attack
with
Spectre/SP2 to redirect speculation back into userspace, at which point (if
successful) the pipeline will be speculating in 64bit mode, and Meltdown is
back on
the table.  SMEP will block this attack vector, irrespective of other SP2
defenses
the kernel may employ, but a fully SP2-defended kernel doesn't require SMEP
to be
safe in this case.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Dave, nearby, remarked, "regardless of Meltdown/Spectre, SMEP is
valuable.
It's valuable to everything, compatibility-mode or not."
</p>

<p>
<strong>SMEP</strong> (Supervisor Mode Execution Protection) is a hardware
mode, whereby the OS can
set a register on compatible CPUs to prevent userspace code from running.
Only
code that already has root permissions can run when SMEP is activated.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Andy Lutomirski</strong> said that he didn't like Nadav's patch
because he said it drew a
distinction between "compatibility mode" tasks and "non-compatibility mode"
tasks.
Andy said no such distinction should be made, especially since it's not
really
clear how to make that distinction, and because the ramifications of getting
it
wrong might be to expose significant security holes.
</p>

<p>
Andy felt that a better solution would be to enable and disable 32-bit
mode and 64-bit mode explicitly as needed, rather than guessing at what
might or might not be
compatibility mode.
</p>

<p>
The drawback to this approach, Andy said, was that old software would need
to be
upgraded to take advantage of it, whereas with Nadav's approach, the
judgment would
be made automatically and would not require old code to be updated.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> was not optimistic about any of these ideas.
He said, "I just feel
this all is a nightmare. I can see how you would want to think that
compatibility
mode doesn't need PTI, but at the same time it feels like a really risky
move to do
this." He added, "I'm not seeing how you keep user mode from going from
compatibility mode to L mode with just a far jump."
</p>

<p>
In other words, the whole patch, and any alternative, may just simply be a
bad
idea.
</p>

<p>
Nadav replied that with his patch, he tried to cover every conceivable case
where
someone might try to break out of compatibility mode and to re-enable PTI
protections if that were to happen. Though he did acknowledge, "There is one
corner
case I did not cover (LAR) and Andy felt this scheme is too complicated.
Unfortunately, I don't have a better scheme in mind."
</p>

<p>
Linus remarked:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sure, I can see it working, but it's some really shady stuff, and now the
scheduler needs to save/restore/check one more subtle bit.
</p>

<p>
And if you get it wrong, things will happily work, except you've now
defeated PTI.
But you'll never notice, because you won't be testing for it, and the only
people
who will are the black hats.
</p>

<p>
This is exactly the "security depends on it being in sync" thing that makes
me go
"eww" about the whole model. Get one thing wrong, and you'll blow all the
PTI code
out of the water.
</p>

<p>
So now you tried to optimize one small case that most people won't use, but
the
downside is that you may make all our PTI work (and all the overhead for all
the
_normal_ cases) pointless.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Andy also remarked, "There's also the fact that, if this stuff goes in,
we'll
be encouraging people to deploy 32-bit binaries.  Then they'll buy
Meltdown-fixed
CPUs (or AMD CPUs!) and they may well continue running 32-bit binaries.
Sigh.  I'm
not totally a fan of this."
</p>

<p>
The whole thread ended inconclusively, with Nadav unsure whether folks
wanted a new
version of his patch.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line seems to be that Linux has currently protected itself from
Intel's
hardware flaws, but at a cost of perhaps 5% to 30% efficiency (the real
numbers
depend on how you use your system). And although it will be complex and
painful,
there is a very strong incentive to improve efficiency by adding subtler and
more
complicated workarounds that avoid the heavy-handed approach of the PTI
patch.
Ultimately, Linux will certainly develop a smooth, near-optimal approach to
Meltdown and Spectre, and probably do away with PTI entirely, just as it did
away
with the BKL in the past. Until then, we're in for some very ugly and
controversial
patches.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_46">Cleaning Up the VFS</h3>

<p>
<strong>Dongsu Park</strong> posted a patch in collaboration with
<strong>Eric W.
Biederman</strong>, and originally
inspired by <strong>Seth Forshee</strong>, to make an odd adjustment to the
filesystem code.
Specifically, they wanted any user with the capability
<strong>CAP_CHOWN</strong> over
a filesystem's superblock, to be able to <code>chown</code> (change the
owner) of files within that
filesystem.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, this would become an issue only when running a virtual system
(that is, a
container) on top of a running Linux system and if the underlying filesystem
had
files with user IDs or group IDs that didn't map to anything in the current
user
namespace within the container. Before writing such files to disk, you'd
have to
run <code>chown</code> on those files to tell them to which owner to map.
Otherwise, writing
such files to disk without a good uid or gid mapping would corrupt those
fields in
the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
A couple technical comments were made about the patch, but <strong>Miklos
Szeredi</strong>
expressed confusion about why the problem solved by the patch might ever be
triggered. If you can't <code>chown</code> the file to be owned by the user
doing the writing,
he remarked, how can you write the file in order to produce the corruption?
To which Eric replied that the patch wasn't actually intended to be a fix
for any
real problem. No one was in danger of hitting this particular problem.
</p>

<p>
The patch, he explained, was part of a larger strategy of shoring up the
virtual
file system (VFS) and making sure it handled all generic cases
correctly—whether
or not those cases could occur in real life. The goal was to draw a clear
distinction between problems showing up in real-world filesystems and
problems
showing up at the lower VFS level. This way, when bug reports came in, it
would be
more straightforward to associate them with particular filesystems, rather
than
trying to debug them in the VFS.
</p>

<p>
He said, "In this case the generic concern is what happens when the uid is
read
from the filesystem and it gets mapped to INVALID_UID and then the inode for
that
file is written back. That is a trap for the unwary filesystem
implementation and
not a case that I think anyone will actually care about."
</p>

<p>
So essentially, it was not even a housekeeping patch, but instead a patch to
make
housekeeping itself easier.
