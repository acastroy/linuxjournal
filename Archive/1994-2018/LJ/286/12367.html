<h1 class="title">Visualizing Molecules with EasyChem</h1>


<p>
Chemistry is one of the heavy hitters in computational science. This
has been true since the beginning, and it's no less true today. Because
of this, several software packages specifically target this user
group. Most of these software packages focus on
calculating things within chemistry, like bond energies or protein
folding structures. But, once you've done the science portion, you
need to be able to communicate your results, usually in the form
of papers published in journals. And, part of the information you'll need to
disseminate is imagery of the molecules from your work. And, that's
where EasyChem, this article's subject, comes into play.
</p>

<p>
EasyChem helps generate publication-quality images of
molecular structures. It should be available in the package management
repositories for most distributions. In Debian-based distributions,
you can install it with the following command:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get installed easychem
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Once it's installed, you can start it either from your GUI's menu
system or from the command prompt. When it first starts, you get a
blank canvas within which to start your project. 
</p>

  </div>

<p>
One of the
first things you'll want to check is whether the option to have helpful
messages is turned on. You can check this by clicking
Options→Learning messages. With this selected, you'll get helpful
information in the bottom bar of the EasyChem window.
</p>


<p>
Let's start with a simple molecule like benzene. Benzene is a ring of
six carbon atoms, with every other bond a double bond. You can create this
structure by using the options at the bottom of the draw window. Making
sure that the "Add bonds" option is selected, select the "Simple"
bond from the drop-down of "Bond type". If you now place the mouse
pointer somewhere in the window and click and drag, you'll get a single
bond drawn. To get a ring, you need to hold down the Ctrl key, and then
click and drag. This will draw a ring structure for you. 
</p>

<p>
You can set the number
of atoms to use in the ring with the "Ring size" option
in the bottom left of the window. The default is six, which is what you'll want
for your benzene ring. 
</p>

<p>
To get the alternating bond types,
select the "Edit" option at the bottom, and then you'll be able to
select individual bonds and change their types. When you select one of
the bonds, you'll see a new pop-up window where you can change the
details, such as the type of bond, along with
the color and the relative width if it is a multiple bond.
</p>
<div class="caption">
    <img alt="edit screen" src="12367f2.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 2. EasyChem lets you change several options of individual bonds.</p>
  </div>

<p>
Once you have some of your diagram constructed, you'll likely want to
make alterations to the overall look. When you select the first option
at the bottom of the window, labeled "Adjust", you can select one or more
objects and adjust their position in the diagram. If you have a collection
of objects you need to move, you can select them by creating a box around
them with your mouse. They'll then change color to show they've 
been selected and you can move them around. If you select a single
bond instead, the rest of the molecule will be adjusted when you
move that one single bond. 
</p>

    <img alt="EasyChem screen" src="12367f3.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3. You can move elements of your diagram around, either individually or as a group.</p>
  </div>

<p>
You can rotate selections of your diagram with the Rotate option. In the 
benzene ring example, you can't rotate individual bonds. It only
makes sense to rotate the complete ring.
</p>

<p>
You also can add ornamentation to the ending of the bonds. These are items
like non-bonding pairs, electronic gaps or radicals. If you are creating
larger additions to a molecule, you'll probably want to build it up
from simpler pieces. For example, if you want to add an OH group to the
benzene ring, you would add a single bond to one of the vertices. Next,
at the end of this new bond, you would add an "Atom/Group" bond type, and then
you can add a label to it. 
</p>

    <img alt="workspace screen" src="12367f4.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption">Figure 4. You can use simpler structures to build up more complicated objects.</p>
  </div>

<p>
The bond type list provides other decorative options. For example, you could add a circle to
the center of the benzene ring, or you could add arrows or arcs to
indicate transitions.
</p>

<p>
You can save your images using the native file format. When you click
File→Save, a dialog window pops up asking you to save
your work to a file with the ".ech" ending. This way you can save your
intermediate steps and be able to re-create any output files. When you
finish your molecule, you'll want to export it so you can
use it in one of your documents. EasyChem provides several options
for exporting your image into encapsulated PostScript files. These files
have the ".eps" filename ending. If you're writing your paper in LaTeX,
this probably is your best option, as it provides the best quality. It
also has the ability to save in xfig format. You then can import it
into any other software that understands xfig. Both of these options
are text-based file formats. They're essentially instructions to a
printing device. The final option is to export it to PDF format. Although
more people may be experienced with PDF files, they're essentially
binary in nature. This means that they aren't as easily incorporated
into other documents, so you'll most likely want to
accept the default EPS file format.
