FOSS as a Part of a Corporate Sustainability Plan</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_94">
Free and open-source software is a critical part of your company's supply
chain. Here's why and how you can include it in your corporate sustainability plan. By
VM (aka Vicky) Brasseur</h2>

<p>
In 1983 the United Nations convened a commission of 22 people to investigate the
question of the worldwide environmental and social impact of human development. Four
years later, in 1987, the commission released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future">Our Common Future</a>, more commonly known
as the <em>Brundtland Report</em> in honour of Gro Harlem Brundtland, chairperson of the
commission. This report detailed the very real socio-environmental issues facing
humanity. One of its recommendations was for governments, organisations and companies
to start engaging in what it called <em>sustainable development</em>. That is, "...development
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs".
</p>

<p>
Since then there's been <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/corporate-sustainability-at-a-crossroads">steep
growth</a> in the number of corporations that maintain and
operate according to a corporate sustainability plan. These plans encompass
environmental as well as social aspects of doing business. They encompass actions
within an organisation—such as natural resource usage, diversity and inclusion,
and fair treatment of employees—as well as those external to the
organisation—such as the sustainability operations of their entire supply chain as
well as the overall impact the corporation has on the Earth and its inhabitants.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_95">
The Benefits of Sustainability</h3>

<p>
A sustainability plan impacts every facet of an organization's operations and can take
a fair bit of effort to implement and maintain. If that's the case, why are more
corporations putting these plans into action every year? While it would be nice to
think that this occurs for entirely altruistic reasons—taking care of the Earth
and its inhabitants is simply the right thing to do, after all—the fact of the
matter is that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-lessons-from-the-front-lines">studies
repeatedly show</a> that properly implemented corporate
sustainability plans are very good for the bottom line.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_96">
Innovations and Profitability</h3>

<p>
Sustainability requires partnering and collaborating not only across groups within the
organisation, but also with many external to it. These collaborations expose a
corporation to new ideas and innovations in market, process, policy and product, all
of which can lead to improved profitability while moving the company toward its
sustainability goals. Without the support and engagement of all employees, a
sustainability plan will fail. Therefore, the execution of a sustainability strategy
requires a shift in management from the old style of command and control toward a
modern style of trust, communication and employee development. By empowering and
training employees, a sustainable corporation improves its ability to execute plans
while also increasing employee satisfaction and retention. Beyond just innovations,
profitability is increased through reduced expenditures, entry into new markets and a
lower cost of capital.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_97">
Investments</h3>

<p>
Investments are also impacted, as more investors are now looking at a corporation's
sustainability plan as a deciding factor on where to place their money. When you think
about it, it's surprising that sustainability hasn't been a primary investor
consideration before now. The strategies that support a successful corporate
sustainability plan, focusing on what's good for society and the environment, are also
those that do good for the company. Protecting the organization's value and supply
chains enables it to ensure it will be around for a good, long while. That
longevity—and plan to maintain it—is very appealing to investors in search of
both stability and a positive return on their investments. Despite this, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/investing-for-a-sustainable-future">studies
show</a>
that most high-level corporate managers still don't recognise the importance
sustainability holds for investors. This provides a great opportunity for those
managers who can launch and make a corporate sustainability plan successful before
their competitors.
</p>

<p>
So, yes, corporate sustainability planning (when done properly) is that proverbial
rising tide that floats all boats. However, for companies that rely upon technology to
keep their business operating (read: all of them), there's a major component that's
usually left out of their sustainability plan: the software.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_98">
Open-Source Software Is a Part of Your Supply Chain</h3>

<p>
Operating systems, databases, libraries, infrastructure management and
orchestration—no matter what component, all software is a part of your company's
supply chain. How much do you know about it? Do you know what your company's software
supply chain looks like? How much of that chain is or depends upon free and open-source software? If you haven't investigated this before, you'll likely be surprised
by the answer. If you look at little deeper, you'll be even more surprised to discover
just how few people maintain and support the software on which your company relies to
operate and do business.
</p>

<p>
However you look at it, this arrangement is fraught with sustainability concerns.
Socially, allowing so few people to perform so much work for so little compensation is
inappropriate and does not scale. From a business perspective, it's very poor practice
to rely upon suppliers who may burn out and disappear at any moment. This does nothing
good for the longevity prospects for your organisation and dramatically increases its
risk profile.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_99">
Open-Source Software Is Good for Sustainability</h3>

<p>
Don't get the wrong idea: I'm not here to spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (aka
<em>FUD</em>) about having free and open-source software projects as a part of your supply
chain. Even a quick glance will show that you're unlikely to receive as much value and
flexibility from proprietary solutions (if they even exist). Proprietary software is
incredibly expensive, less flexible, leads to vendor lock-in and is at least as
likely to disappear without notice. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/startupcompass-public/StartupGenomeReport2_Why_Startups_Fail_v2.pdf">90%
of software startups fail</a>, taking their
products and their code with them. The high cost, low innovation and equal risk of
mortality for proprietary software makes it a less appealing solution when considering
the longevity and sustainability of your own company. Free and open-source solutions
are simply the better option.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_100">
What Is YOUR Software Supply Chain?</h3>

<p>
The answer, then, is not to cut out the free and open-source links in your supply
chain. No, the actual answer is to include free and open-source software in your
corporate sustainability plan. Unlike proprietary software, free and open-source
(FOSS) solutions enable your company to take action to ensure that the FOSS projects
themselves are sustainable. So, how can your company do that?
</p>

<p>
For starters, if you haven't done so yet, take this opportunity to become very
familiar with your company's software supply chain. Certain links in that chain will
be more important and more strategic than others. While your software sustainability
efforts should include all of the links in the chain—FOSS or proprietary—you
may find that it makes sense to focus more of your investment in these strategic
links.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_101">
Build a Culture of Contribution</h3>

<p>
As you're evaluating and integrating your software supply chain into your corporate
sustainability plan, start communicating internally about the importance of this supply
chain. This communication should be across the entire organisation, not simply
constrained to the technical departments. By communicating and including the entire
company, you open up more avenues for ideas and innovations in sustainability as well
as start to build a culture of sharing and contribution that will aid in all your
sustainability efforts, FOSS or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
That culture of contribution will be critical for the next step: empowering staff
members to contribute back to the FOSS projects on which your company relies.
Reporting bugs and requesting features is one way to contribute, but fixing bugs,
adding features and contributing those changes upstream to the main project is what
will lead to improved project longevity. It often can make sense for a company to pay
team members to work full time maintaining and enhancing strategic free and open-source software projects, but even small contributions submitted by individuals
scattered across the organisation can aggregate into a large amount of work toward
sustaining the projects on which your company relies. Making it easy for team members to
contribute will make it much more likely that they will support the projects through
their contributions. Remember also that FOSS projects need more than just programmers
in order to thrive. Enabling contributions from your QA, design, marketing and other
departments will enhance the entire ecosystem of the free and open-source software
that enables your company to operate, adding to its longevity and reducing risk both
for it and for your own company.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_102">
Share the Load</h3>

<p>
As you review your software supply chain, consider the problem that each one of those
links in the chain is there to solve. Your company is not the only one to have those
problems. These are issues faced by many organisations, and no one company will be
able to solve these shared problems.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the next step in integrating free and open-source software into your
corporate sustainability planning is to release the software your company has
developed to solve problems shared by others. Of course, this doesn't mean you should
necessarily <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/do-i-have-use-freeopen-source-license">release the software that provides legitimate market differentiation and
value for your company</a>, but there are undoubtedly several tools developed internally
that are not of strategic market value but that solve specific problems. By releasing
those tools, you enable collaboration with organisations that share similar problems.
</p>

<p>
By working together to solve these problems through free and open-source software, all
collaborators share the load of development. This allows them to benefit from the tool
while also freeing up internal resources to focus on strategic value creation for
their markets. In a case study created by <a href="https://www.opentechstrategies.com">Open Tech Strategies</a> and <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/leveraging-open-source-public-institution-new-analysis-reveals-significant-returns-investment-open">released by the
World Bank</a>, collaboration on free and open-source software tools led to a 200% return
on investment for the collaborators. Sharing the burden of maintaining these tools
ensures their longevity and stability while reducing institutional risk. The end
result is a more sustainable business and a healthier free and open-source software
ecosystem.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_103">
Join a Foundation</h3>

<p>
Depending upon the free and open-source software in your supply chain, one approach
toward sustainability may be participating in the organisations and foundations formed
to support projects that are strategic to your company. By joining organisations like
<a href="https://opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">Linux
Foundation</a>, your organisation not only has a seat at the table when discussing the
future of strategic FOSS projects, it also gets the opportunity to meet, discuss and
collaborate with companies it may not have had occasion to interact with otherwise. By
bringing together disparate organisations and providing not only a shared purpose but
also a safe environment for collaboration, these foundations enable member companies
to learn from each other and to open the doors for new partnerships and innovations.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_104">
Think Strategically</h3>

<p>
I've said it already in this article, but it's worth repeating that, just as with the
rest of your corporate sustainability plan, it's crucial that your company's approach
to supporting free and open-source software projects be <em>strategic</em>.
Although it's tempting
to contribute to all FOSS projects equally—and certainly the projects themselves
would not complain—from a sustainability point of view, your organisation should
try to focus its resources on those projects that make a material difference to your
company. <em>Material difference</em> means that a project, were it to stop being developed or
maintained, would <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-reporting-one-size-fits-nobody">severely
impact the operations of your company</a>. These are the FOSS
projects most directly linked to your organization's longevity, and it also makes them
risk factors for your corporate sustainability plan.
</p>

<p>
In order to determine which projects are material to your corporation, you must be
fully aware of your software supply chain. This involves not only looking at the free
and open-source software that allows your company to operate, but also digging deeper
to learn on what projects <em>those</em> projects rely. It's all well and good to acknowledge
that the authentication library used for your product is material to company
longevity, but if that library itself relies upon cryptographic functionality in
another—woefully under-funded—project, your company may be exposed to
<a href="http://heartbleed.com">unforeseen but preventable risks</a>. Ignorance of your software supply chain is no
defense against vulnerabilities. Cultivating an awareness of the entire ecosystem
within which strategic and material FOSS projects operate will help secure corporate
longevity and sustainability.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_105">
Make a Business Case</h3>

<p>
Focusing software sustainability efforts on material and strategic concerns makes it
considerably easier to incorporate free and open-source software into the business
case for your company's corporate sustainability plan. It may be tempting to skip this
step, but if you do so <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/investing-for-a-sustainable-future">studies show that it's likely your sustainability plan will
fail</a>. When you pause to consider this, it makes perfect sense. Why should a
corporation invest so many resources in shifting the way it does business, up to and
including its very business model, if there is nothing in it for them? Again, setting
aside altruistic appeals and the fact that taking care of the Earth and its
inhabitants is just the right thing to do, being able to make a well-researched and
detailed case that doing so is good for the bottom line makes it more likely that even
the less environmentally and socially minded leaders in your company will get on
board with the plan. Don't simply list what changes will be necessary to enact a
corporate sustainability plan, but also reveal exactly what is in it for the company
for making this effort.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_106">
You're All in This Together</h3>

<p>
As mentioned earlier, it's important for any corporate sustainability plan to create a
culture of contribution across the entire organisation. If upper management does not
communicate what the plan is meant to accomplish and why, it will fail to get the
support of the employees who actually have to do the heavy lifting of implementing
that plan. Without the support of the entire organisation, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/corporate-sustainability-at-a-crossroads">your corporate
sustainability plan will fail</a>. Sustainability must be a 360-degree effort, not simply
something dictated from on high. All members and stakeholders of the company must
understand what the sustainability plan is, what impact it will have, what part they
specifically will play, and how they will make a difference to the overall outcome.
</p>

<p>
This communication is hard enough when the plan is simply about environmental and
social concerns, issues with which most people are familiar, but it becomes much more
difficult when unfamiliar concepts like "free software" and "open source" enter the
mix. This is why it's so important to begin the discussion as early as possible. It
can take some time for people to understand that "contribute back to free and open-source software projects" can be as meaningful and impactful to the corporate
sustainability plan as "reduce water usage", "use energy from renewable sources" or
"eliminate the gender/race pay gap".
</p>

<p>
To help with this communication, rather than dictating implementation details to
middle management, company leaders should instead set software sustainability goals
for each team or department and then allow each group to define how it can best
contribute toward those goals. For technical departments, their contributions may be as
straightforward as providing patches or releasing internal tools, while less technical
departments may come up with less obvious approaches to helping the effort. By
empowering each team to approach the problem in its own way, the company is not only
encouraging innovation, but it's also building trust within its ranks. This trust, as
mentioned before, increases the effectiveness not only of the sustainability plan but
also of other operations undertaken by these teams. This trust also leads to higher
employee satisfaction and retention. The overall culture of the company evolves into
one that is more collaborative, innovative and therefore sustainable.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_107">
Keep Yourself Accountable</h3>

<p>
A vital part of any corporate sustainability plan is the company holding itself
accountable for delivering on its promises to itself, to its stakeholders and to the
communities on which it relies. Fostering a culture of collaboration includes
supporting open communication. That openness must permeate all levels of the company.
Embracing and supporting free and open-source software and their underlying values can
help cultivate the communication required for accountability. Instituting <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/9/innersource">inner
sourcing</a> is a good way to encourage collaboration, communication and cross-functional
accountability on your corporate sustainability plan.
</p>

<p>
Accountability also can be included at an organizational level by way of performance
reviews. For this to work, all employees must understand how they contribute to the
overall corporate sustainability plan so that they can work toward meeting their
particular goals. This is especially important at the executive level. When leaders
are held accountable for their sustainability strategies and plans, it reinforces the
importance of the effort to the organisation and encourages participation by all
members. Reporting on the company's progress on its sustainability plan also provides
accountability to external stakeholders like investors, partners and customers. For
many companies, it can be uncomfortable at first to embrace this form of open
communication both internally and externally, but if they are able to make this
shift,
they'll <a href="https://www.ceres.org/roadmap">reap the benefits of
sustainability</a>. It can be a difficult journey, but it's
one entirely worth taking.
