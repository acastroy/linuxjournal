    The Debian project has always been open to anyone wanting to
    participate in discussion of its development, but it was
    only recently that the actual task of package maintenance
    was allocated to members of the project. This was an
    extremely important step in the development of Debian, and
    in this month's column I will explain why it was done, why
    it could not have een done any sooner, and why this step
    will only make the Debian system better.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29de580.0x2ad6298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since the early days of Debian, I have described it as the
first distribution of Linux to be developed openly in the spirit of
the operating system and the free software movement. My
justification was the success of the kernel; after all, open and
distributed development had worked so well for the kernel, why
couldn't it work just as well for a distribution?</p><p>The justification made sense, of course, but the reality was
not quite that simple. Before any open development could be done, a
cohesive development group had to be organized, a solid foundation
upon which to develop had to be made available, and most
importantly, it had to be proven that open and distributed
development could actually work for a distribution. At the
beginning, there were many strong supporters of Debian, but there
were just as many people who said that it simply could not be
done.</p><p>For the first months of the project, although many volunteers
helped prepare Debian for distribution, I was the one who actually
assembled the version to be released, since the guidelines for
creating all the pieces of the distribution changed from day to day
as we improved the system. Also, the most recent versions of most
of the guidelines were often only to be found in my head.</p><p>Because one person has limited time, I could only do this job
by myself for so long, while the system was still small, even with
volunteers helping get many of the pieces ready. As the guidelines
began to stabilize, and as the system became large enough that I
could not put the system together single-handedly (as I found out
when I tried), it became clear that the time had come to take the
next step.</p><p>With an organized system for creating the Debian distribution
in hand, the volunteers who had already been helping to create
Debian packages were able to step forward and take complete
responsibility for them, without fear of anarchy. They can package
their own software, knowing that it will fit smoothly into the rest
of the Debian system.</p><p>It has been a rough ride, but the Debian project survives and
is stronger now than it has ever been. We are organized, we have a
solid foundation coming in the release of Debian 0.93 BETA, and, as
proven by the support that Debian has received and the enthusiasm
of the Debian project volunteers, we have proven that the idea of
an openly-developed distribution can work. I remain the maintainer
of the base system and several development packages, and I serve as
the leader of the project as a whole. But I am now only a part of a
larger movement, a movement that is gaining momentum. So, what does
all of this mean to the users of Debian?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29de580.0x2ad6558"></a>It means high quality.</h2></div></div><p>We have many well-respected members of the Linux community
directly involved in the development of Debian. We have experts
working directly on the parts of Debian involving their area of
expertise. We have package maintainers that closely follow new
releases of the software that they are packaging, and in many
cases, participate directly in the development of the software
itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29de580.0x2ad6660"></a>It means consistency.</h2></div></div><p>We now have drafted guidelines which define the construction
of Debian binary and source packages. With the help of these
guidelines, package maintainers may put together packages that are
consistent with those put together by other package maintainers.
The Debian leadership checks to ensure that each package is
assembled correctly and that the system as a whole is solid; the
end result is a set of packages that, though developed and
maintained by many different individuals, are as consistent and as
professionally constructed as if they were developed by a single
person or closely-knit group, but without the limitations imposed
by centralized development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29de580.0x2ad6768"></a>It means modularity.</h2></div></div><p>No longer does one person have to shoulder the burden of
constructing every package. As mentioned earlier, I maintain the
base system and many of the development packages; others maintain
the networking packages, the XFree86 packages and so on. When a new
component is available, the package maintainer may simply update
that package and make the newest version available, without a
complete update of Debian. The days of massive, comprehensive
re-releases of Debian are over; each component of Debian will be
fairly independent of all others, and it will be easy for the
end-user to upgrade his system or any component of it.</p><p>And, most importantly, need I mention that you, too, can
become involved!</p></div></div>
