    Now the problem is, how the
    heck do you create the new filesystems, and how do you copy the files
    over? This month's article will help you do that.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d8240"></a></h2></div></div><p>When you installed Linux for the first
time, you made at least one filesystem to store Linux on. If you're
like me at all, you quickly decided you needed more drive space.
Now the problem is, how the heck do you create the new filesystems,
and how do you copy the files over? This month's article will help
you do that. I'm also going to go into describing the /etc/inittab
file, a rather important file that gets loaded when you boot your
system. When making a filesystem for expanding your system space,
there are a few things you have to consider. Where do you want your
new fielsystem located? Making a larger /usr directory may be what
you need, but expanding your /usr/X386 directory may be a better
idea. Remember that not all filesystems have to come off the /
(root) directory. You can mount any directory to any filesystem,
but don't put any of the following on a different filesystem other
than /: /etc /dev /lib /sbin /bin /conf. Each of these directories
are needed during boot-up, and other filesystems are mounted
*after* Linux has booted. This could make booting up Linux a
difficult or impossible task. Let's assume that you want to make
your user partitions bigger, and that you have your user's home
directories in the /user directory, currently on the / (root)
partition. Here's what you do. NOTES: IDE drives are /dev/hda and
/dev/hdb. SCSI drives use /dev/sda through /dev/sde. Your
particular setup may look different than my sample setup. Please
read all the instructions and be sure you understand what is going
on before you start!! If you are confused, look at the manual pages
for the commands that I reference. They are a great help.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d8348"></a>Make the partition you want to use.</h2></div></div><p>Go into fdisk (`fdisk' followed by the drive name&mdash;/dev/hda,
/dev/hdb, etc). Make a new partition by using the
<b  >n</b> command. You will now be asked for a partition
type (extended, primary, or logical). Answer with the partition
type you want to use. Now, you have to give a starting cylinder.
For simplicity, just type in the first number you see in the list.
After this, you must now type in the size of the partitions in 1K
blocks. You can also type in a number followed by
<b  >M</b> to specify that the number is 1Meg blocks. So
an answer of 30M would make a 30Meg partition. Your new partition
should now be set up. Type <b  >p</b> to list your
partitions and write down the block size of the partition you just
created. You'll need this in your next step. Quit fdisk (with the
<b  >w</b> command), and you may want to reboot your
machine at this time to make sure that the partitions are read
correctly. In my setup, I have a new drive I just installed, and
I'm going to make a logical partition on my second hard drive
(/dev/hdb):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#fdisk /dev/hdb

<span   class="bold"><b>mke2fs</b></span>. I'm using EXT2FS (as it is
commonly called) because it provides a lot of features now, plus
has the ability for future support built in. For example, it
supports a clean bit where if you unmount a filesystem
successfully, you won't get bugged later on to do a filesystem
check. It makes booting up Linux much faster. There is also the
ability to support a compressed filesystem, where files are
automatically compressed. This is not coded into the filesystem
yet, but when the kernel supports it, you'll have a compressed
filesystem. But back to making your filesystem. Type the command:
<b  >mke2fs -c &lt;partition&gt; &lt;size in blocks&gt; where
&lt;partition&gt;</b> is the hard drive partition you wish to
format and &lt;blocks&gt; is the number of 1K blocks that you wrote
down in the previous step. The <b  >-c</b> tells mke2fs
to automatically check for bad blocks. This will help avoid
surprises when the hard drive tries writing to a bad block later
on.</p><p>In my case:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#mke2fs -c /dev/hdb5 31019
{Various data about number of inodes, number of blocks, etc} #
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d88c8"></a>Make a copy of partition you want to
move</h2></div></div><p>The best way to do this is to use the tar (tape archive)
command. A tar file will store important information like file
ownership, permissions, and file dates that a copy command would
lose. Find out the size of the files you're copying with the
<b  >du -s &lt;directory&gt;</b> command, where
&lt;directory&gt; is the directory you want to move to the new
partition. The <b  >-s</b> option will give a grand total
of all the files and directories. I want disk usage of the /user
directory, so <b  >df -s /user</b> will tell me how much
space the /user directory currently takes up:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#df -s /user
11906 #
</pre><p>As this number is in 1K blocks, I know that my /user
direc-tory and all the user files under that take up just under
12Meg. Luckily, my root partition has 15Meg free (you can check
your free space with the <b  >df</b> command). Use the
following command to make a tar file of your /user directory:
<b  >tar -cvf &lt;tar file&gt; &lt;directory&gt;</b>,
where &lt;tarfile&gt; tells what you want to call the tar file and
&lt;directory&gt; is the directory you want to tar up. For me, this
would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#cd / #tar -cvf /user.tar /user user user/root user/root/.bashrc
{list of files} #
</pre><p>The c option tells tar you want to create a tar file, the v
option tells tar to tell you what files it's adding to the tar
file, and the f option tells tar that the next thing it sees is a
file to create. Now, if you're in the root directory and type
<b  >ls -la user.tar</b> you should see something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ls -la user.tar -rw-r-r-   1 root     root        12103680 Mar  1 01:41
user.tar #
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d8d98"></a>Remove the old directory</h2></div></div><p>Now for the fun part. Yes, you get to use the horrid, deadly,
yet subtle, rm -r command. But be warned! Typing in this command
wrong in any way has the potential to crash your system, or lose
files you did not want to lose! Before you do this, make sure that
your data is backed up somewhere! Make sure it is in either the tar
file you just created, or create a second backup if you really want
to make sure!</p><p>I'll do it step-by-step:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Go into the directory you want to delete. For me,
this is the /user directory, so I type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#cd /user #
</pre></li><li><p>VERIFY that you are in the correct directory! Use
the <b  >pwd</b> command to tell you where you are. If
you're not in the right directory, go back to step 1. My response
should be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#pwd /user #
</pre></li><li><p>If you still have qualms about using <b  >rm -r
*</b>, go into each of the directories, delete the files in
the directories, and then remove the directories by hand. This is
safer, yet takes more time. Delete files using the <b  >rm
&lt;file&gt;</b> command, and directories can be deleted
using the <b  >rmdir &lt;directory&gt;</b> command. The
rm -rv command will delete everything in the current directory,
plus all of the subdirectories of that directory. The `v' option
will list everything that gets deleted as it happens, so you will
know what is going on.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#rm -rv * {list of files and subdirectories} #
</pre></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d93c8"></a>Mount the new partition</h2></div></div><p>Make sure that the directory that you want to mount exists.
For example, if I want to mount a partition on /user, the /user
directory has to exist. Now you get to mount the partition you
created a few minutes ago, and make it a functional part of your
system: <b  >mount -t ext2 &lt;partition&gt;
&lt;directory&gt;</b>, where &lt;partition&gt; is the
partition you want to mount and &lt;directory&gt; is where you want
to mount that partition off of. In my case, I'll use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb5 /user
#
</pre><p>If you change directory into your new directory, it looks
just like it did before, only there is a new directory -
lost+found. This directory is where e2fsck places blocks it has no
idea about. This is similar to the files created by the DOS chkdsk
command. However, as long as you shut your system down properly and
you have few power outages or system crashes, you will probably
never need to go into this directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e0580.0x21d95d8"></a>Copy files into directory</h2></div></div><p>Now we'll use the tar command as we did last time, only now
we want to extract the files in user.tar. This will restore the
files to their original appearance. They will have the same
ownership, same file dates, and most importantly, the same data.
Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd / tar -xvf &lt;tar file&gt;
</pre><p>where &lt;tar file&gt; is the tape archive file from earlier
in our procedure.
</p><p>For me:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#cd / #tar -xvf user.tar user user/root user/root/.bashrc {list
        of files} #
</pre><p>And now you are back to the point you were at the beginning
of this article, with the exception of a lot more user space. There
is one more thing which must be done. That is to add your new
filesystem to the boot files so that your new partition will
automatically be mounted every time you boot Linux. This is an easy
part. Go into the /etc directory, and edit the fstab file. At the
end of the file, add a line of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;partition&gt; &lt;mount point&gt; &lt;fstype&gt; defaults
</pre><p>where &lt;partition&gt; is the hard drive partition,
&lt;mount point&gt; is the directory you want to mount the
partition to, and &lt;fstype&gt; is the filesystem type you are
using. You may see other entries where the fstype is ext2, proc, or
swap. These describe the EXT2FS (the filesystem we are using), the
/proc filesystem which is used for system status information, and
virtual memory or swap space.
</p><p>The line that I have to add looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hdb5  /user   ext2    defaults
</pre><p>Save the file, and the next time you boot Linux, the
partition will be automatically mounted off of the /user
partition.</p><p>Whew, that was fun, eh kids? Now on to a portion of your
configuration files. I'll be going over most of the configuration
files, and we'll start with one of the first programs that gets
read - /etc/inittab.</p><p>You may have noticed a file running when you run <b  >ps
aux</b> called init or /etc/init. This is the parent of all
other programms on your system, from the initialization files such
as /etc/inetd, to the getty program that lets you log into the
system, init starts it.</p><p>Since the parts of the inittab file change with the various
versions of the /etc utilities, I'll show you some of the major
parts of inittab. Any of the fine details can be found in the man
pages for init and inittab.</p><p>First, init bases a lot on the runlevel. For example, one
runlevel can be defined as a `safe boot' where only root can log
in.</p><p>Another runlevel can set up your serial port to accept
logins. You can set these run levels at boot time, you can manually
enter a runlevel while booting, or can change the runlevel on the
fly by using the /etc/telinit command.</p><p>An entry in the inittab file has four fields:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   rc:123456:wait:/etc/rc.M
</pre><p>Field 1 is a unique identifier, field 2 lists the runlevels
that this command applies to, field 3 tells init what to do when
running the program, and field 4 lists the program to run.</p><p>In your inittab file, you may see a line that has
`initdefault' in the third field. The number on that line will
specify what runlevel to use when booting. If that line is not in
the inittab file, you will be prompted for a runlevel. Mine is set
to `5', and my line looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   id:5:initdefault:
</pre><p>If the default runlevel is set to `S' or `s', Linux will go
into a single-user mode, where /bin/sh is automatically started on
the console.</p><p>The next thing that init looks for are entries that have type
`boot' or `bootwait' associated with them. This allows files such
as your /etc/rc files to be run so that all your partitions will be
mounted before the first user logs in. The `boot' entry means to
start that process and not wait for it to finish. The `bootwait'
entries mean to run that program and wait until it finishes
successfully before doing the next thing. I have none of these
entries, as it allows me to have different /etc/rc files
used.</p><p>Next, init looks for lines that have that particular
runlevels listed. In the second field, you should have a list of
the runlevels that a program can be started in. For example, I have
a runlevel 6 which starts up X-Windows automatically, and my other
5 runlevels are currently unused. My entries for the configuration
files looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rc:123456:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc.M x1:6:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc.6
</pre><p>Here, the /etc/rc.d/rc.M (M for multi-user) get started every
time. But on runlevel 6, it will start up the extra programs
necessary to start up X-Windows automatically. As you can see, the
rc.M file will be executed on every runlevel except `S' (single
user), since all the other runlevels are listed in the second
field. The third field `wait' tells init to wait until that program
is completed before going to the next init entry.</p><p>The next set of entries that are important are the ones that
control getty, the program that monitors the console and serial
ports for logins. Mine looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1
</pre><p>and a few other lines with the difference that the `tty1' is
`tty2' and the `c1' is `c2'. The important part here is the third
and fourth fields. The `respawn' entry tells init that if the
program stops running, to start another one back up. This means
that when you log out, init will automatically start another getty
program so that you will get the login prompt again. Without the
`respawn', after you log out, you won't be able to log back in on
that Virtual Console.
</p><p>There are a few other lines you may want to pay attention to
if you want to connect a dumb terminal to your machine. These are
two lines that are probably commented out by having a `#' at the
beginning of the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   #s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0 #s2:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty
        9600 ttyS1
</pre><p>If you uncomment a line and reboot (or use /etc/telinit) in
runlevel 4 or 5, a getty process will get started on that
particular serial port. Remember that ttyS0 relates to COM1 in DOS,
ttyS1 relates to COM2, etc. After rebooting, you should see a
`/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0' if you type in `ps aux', and you should
get a login prompt if you connect a terminal or another PC to the
serial port.</p></div></div>
