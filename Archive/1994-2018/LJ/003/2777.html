    <i  >Linux Journal</i> has gone through some major changes during its
    first few months of existence, and Linux itslef has gone
    through a few. However, some things have not changed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0b1e8"></a>A New Editor</h2></div></div><p>That's me. One of the changes here at <i  >Linux Journal</i> is the
new editor. My name is Michael K. Johnson, and I have used and
hacked Linux since it was first able to boot itself late in 1991. I
have made some small kernel modifications (&ldquo;hacks&rdquo; in Linux-speak)
and maintained several programs for Linux. I started the original
&ldquo;man project&rdquo; in early 1992, and helped form the &ldquo;Linux
Documentation Project&rdquo; which was formed later to write a complete
documentation set for Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0b348"></a>A New Publisher</h2></div></div><p>SSC, publishers of UNIX reference guides and books for over
10 years, is now the publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. By consolidating
most of the work on <i  >Linux Journal</i> in one place (Seattle,
Washington), we hope to avoid the early problems that <i  >Linux Journal</i>
encountered when it was produced cross-country between Washington
and New York.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0b558"></a>A New Linux</h2></div></div><p>While <i  >Linux Journal</i> was experiencing its birth pangs, Linux
version 1.0 was released. Version 1.0 was not quite bug-free, and
in fact was barely different from the versions that preceeded it.
The biggest difference was one of philsophy.</p><p>Previous to version 1.0, a new version of Linux would come
out every week or two, and many people would upgrade right away. No
one would know whether or not some new feature in the new version
had a bug, and some people were bitten by new bugs. This caused
many others to avoid upgrading to the most recent kernel for fear
of encountering a bug.</p><p>Eventually, Linux versions were discussed as if they were
vintages of wine. &ldquo;I have never trusted any of the patch level 13
kernels.&rdquo; &ldquo;Version 0.99 patch level 12 was a nice, stable kernel.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, I remember version 0.95. It was so simple, clean, elegant...&rdquo;
A folklore sprang up about which versions should be run by which
people.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0b768"></a>A New Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>With Linux 1.0, Linus Torvalds (the main author of Linux)
devised a new scheme to avoid this confusion. Linux 1.0 was the
start of a line of Linux versions with no new features, and
hopefully no new bugs. Linux 1.0.1 fixed a few bugs, Linux 1.0.2
fixed more, and so on. However, no Linux version
1.0.&lt;anything&gt; contains any new features that Linux version
1.0 did not have, and therefore hopefully will contain no new bugs.
These versions are intended to be safe.</p><p>New features are now being introduced in a new set of
different versions: Linux versions 1.1.x. Linux 1.1 contained many
new features that were not in 1.0. Each new version 1.1.x may or
may not contain new features, and is likely to contain new bugs.
These new versions are intended for people who like to play with
new features and are willing to risk bugs. These versions are
intended to be fun.</p><p>In general, any &ldquo;even&rdquo; version of Linux, like 1.0.x or 1.2.x,
will be intended to be safe, and any &ldquo;odd&rdquo; version, like 1.1.x or
1.3.x, will be intended to be fun.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0b920"></a>An Old Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>Linux 1.0 is still free; still licensed under the GNU public
license. It is perhaps worth explaining what &ldquo;free&rdquo; means here. It
does not mean free of monetary cost, although you do not have to
pay to get a copy of Linux unless you want to. It means that the
source code is available to anyone, and that anyone who makes
changes to Linux must release the source code for their changes if
they release their changes at all. This will ensure that Linux
remains a completely open system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0ba28"></a>A New Option</h2></div></div><p>More and more commercial software is being made available for
Linux. As Linux users keep asking software companies when they are
going to release a Linux version of their product, more and more
companies have decided that they need to port their product to
Linux. <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s presence at trade shows has increased
interest among some vendors to port their applications to
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0bb88"></a>Another New Option</h2></div></div><p>However, other companies are scared away by the
&ldquo;counter-culture&rdquo; appearance of Linux, confused about whether or
not it is legal for them to release commercial software that runs
on Linux, or simply not interested in porting their
software.</p><p>Eric Youngdale, Al Longyear, and several other hard-working
Linux hackers have been working on &ldquo;iBCS2 compliance&rdquo; for Linux.
This weird-looking acronym (It stands for intel Binary
Compatibility Standard) means that it is now possible to run at
least some binaries intended for SCO Unix or for any of the many
versions of SVR4, including UnixWare.</p><p>The SCO version of WordPerfect, for instance, runs, and even
works under X. The SCO version of Xess, an X-based spreadsheet, is
also known to work, and there have been reports of databases
running as well. The iBCS2 team is interested in hearing success
reports, which they will post in a list so that users can know
whether software works under Linux before puchasing the
software.</p><p>The iBCS2 patches have now been publicly released. The
product isn't perfect yet-in fact, it is still in alpha testing as
I write-but if you want to, you can play with it. Statically linked
binaries seem to work fairly well, but the shared libraries for SCO
and SVR4 are still being written, and do not work as well.</p><p>The IBCS2 patches are available from tsx-11.mit.edu in
/pub/linux/ALPHA/ibcs2/ as I write, but may well have moved to
/pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2/ by the time you read this. There is a README
file in that directory which explains the rest of the files. The
more people that try these patches, the better this iBCS2 support
can get.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc13580.0xd0bdf0"></a>An Old Commitment</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is still committed to giving its readers what
