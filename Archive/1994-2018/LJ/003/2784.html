    While originally written by Brian Fox of the Free Software
    Foundation, bash is now maintained by Chet Ramey. In this
    article, Chet explains the nhistory of shells and then goes
    on to explore features specific to bash.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec5240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Bash is the shell, or command language
interpreter, that will appear in the GNU operating system. The name
is an acronym for the &ldquo;Bourne-Again SHell&rdquo;, a pun on Steve Bourne,
the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell
/bin/sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research
version of Unix.
</p><p>Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh), described
later in this article. It is ultimately intended to be a faithful
implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification
(IEEE Working Group 1003.2). It offers functional improvements over
sh for both interactive and programming use.</p><p>While the GNU operating system will most likely include a
version of the Berkeley shell csh, Bash will be the default shell.
Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs
on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating
systems-an independently-supported port exists for OS/2, and there
are rumors of ports to DOS and Windows NT. Ports to Unix- like
systems such as QNX and Minix are part of the distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec53f8"></a>What's POSIX, anyway?</h2></div></div><p>POSIX is a name originally coined by Richard Stallman for a
family of open system standards based on Unix. There are a number
of aspects of Unix under consideration for standardization, from
the basic system services at the system call and C library level to
applications and tools to system administration and management.
Each area of standardization is assigned to a working group in the
1003 series.</p><p>The POSIX Shell and Tools standard has been developed by IEEE
Working Group 1003.2 (POSIX.2). It concentrates on the command
interpreter interface and utility programs commonly executed from
the command line or by other programs. An initial version of the
standard has been approved and published by the IEEE, and work is
currently underway to update it. There are four primary areas of
work in the 1003.2 standard:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Aspects of the shell's syntax and command language.
A number of special builtins such as cd and exec are being
specified as part of the shell, since their functionality usually
cannot be implemented by a separate executable;</p></li><li><p>A set of utilities to be called by shell scripts
and applications. Examples are programs like sed, tr and awk.
Utilities commonly implemented as shell builtins are described in
this section, such as test and kill. An expansion of this section's
scope, termed the User Portability Extension, or UPE, has
standardized interactive programs such as vi and mailx;</p></li><li><p>A group of functional interfaces to services
provided by the shell, such as the traditional system() C library
function. There are functions to perform shell word expansions,
perform filename expansion (globbing), obtain values of POSIX.2
system configuration variables, retrieve values of environment
variables (getenv()), and other services;</p></li><li><p>A suite of &ldquo;development&rdquo; utilities such as c89 (the
POSIX.2 version of cc), and yacc.</p></li></ul></div><p>Bash is concerned with the aspects of the shell's behavior
defined by POSIX.2. The shell command language has of course been
standardized, including the basic flow control and program
execution constructs, I/O redirection and pipelining, argument
handling, variable expansion, and quoting. The special builtins,
which must be implemented as part of the shell to provide the
desired functionality, are specified as being part of the shell;
examples of these are eval and export. Other utilities appear in
the sections of POSIX.2 not devoted to the shell which are commonly
(and in some cases must be) implemented as builtin commands, such
as read and test. POSIX.2 also specifies aspects of the shell's
interactive behavior as part of the UPE, including job control and
command line editing. Interestingly enough, only vi-style line
editing commands have been standardized; emacs editing commands
were left out due to objections.</p><p>While POSIX.2 includes much of what the shell has
traditionally provided, some important things have been omitted as
being &ldquo;beyond its scope&rdquo;. There is, for instance, no mention of a
difference between a login shell and any other interactive shell
(since POSIX.2 does not specify a login program). No fixed startup
files are defined, either-the standard does not mention
.profile.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec5920"></a>Basic Bash features</h2></div></div><p>Since the Bourne shell provides Bash with most of its
philosophical underpinnings, Bash inherits most of its features and
functionality from sh. Bash implements all of the traditional sh
flow control constructs (for, if, while, etc.). All of the Bourne
shell builtins, including those not specified in the POSIX.2
standard, appear in Bash. Shell functions, introduced in the SVR2
version of the Bourne shell, are similar to shell scripts, but are
defined using a special syntax and are executed in the same process
as the calling shell. Bash has shell functions which behave in a
fashion upward-compatible with sh functions. There are certain
shell variables that Bash interprets in the same way as sh, such as
PS1, IFS and PATH. Bash implements essentially the same grammar,
parameter and variable expansion semantics, redirection, and
quoting as the Bourne shell. Where differences appear between the
POSIX.2 standard and traditional sh behavior, Bash follows
POSIX.</p><p>The Korn Shell (ksh) is a descendent of the Bourne shell
written at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by David Korn. It provides a
number of useful features that POSIX and Bash have adopted. Many of
the interactive facilities in POSIX.2 have their roots in the ksh.
For example, the POSIX and ksh job control facilities are nearly
identical. Bash includes features from the Korn Shell for both
interactive use and shell programming.</p><p>For programming, Bash provides variables such as RANDOM and
REPLY, the typeset builtin, the ability to remove substrings from
variables based on patterns, and shell arithmetic.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>RANDOM expands to a random number each time it is
referenced. Assigning a value to RANDOM seeds the random number
generator.</p></li><li><p>REPLY is the default variable used by the read
builtin when no variable names are supplied as arguments.</p></li><li><p>The typeset builtin is used to define variables and
give them attributes such as readonly.</p></li></ul></div><p>Bash arithmetic allows the evaluation of an expression and
the substitution of the result. Shell variables may be used as
operands, and the result of an expression may be assigned to a
variable. Nearly all of the operators from the C language are
available, with the same precedence rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   $ echo $((3 + 5 * 32)) 163
</pre><p>For interactive use, Bash implements ksh-style aliases and
builtins such as fc (discussed below) and jobs. Bash aliases allow
a string to be substituted for a command name. They can be used to
create a mnemonic for a Unix command name (e.g., <b  >alias
del=rm</b>), to expand a single word to a complex command
(e.g., <b  >alias news='xterm -g 80x45 -title trn -e trn -e -S1
-N &amp;</b>), or to ensure that a command is invoked with a
basic set of options (e.g., <b  >alias ls="/bin/ls
-F"</b>).</p><p>The C shell (csh) was originally written by Bill Joy while at
the University of California at Berkeley. It is widely used and
quite popular for its interactive facilities. Bash includes a
csh-compatible history expansion mechanism (&ldquo;! history&rdquo;), brace
expansion, access to a stack of directories via the pushd, popd and
dirs builtins, and tilde expansion, to generate users' home
directories. Tilde expansion has also been adopted by both the Korn
Shell and POSIX.2.</p><p>There were certain areas in which POSIX.2 felt
standardization was necessary, but no existing implementation
provided the proper behavior. The working group invented and
standardized functionality in these areas, which Bash implements.
The command builtin was invented so that shell functions could be
written to replace builtins; it makes the capabilities of the
builtin available to the function. The reserved word &ldquo;!&rdquo; was added
to negate the return value of a command or pipeline; it was nearly
impossible to express &ldquo;if not x&rdquo; cleanly using the sh
language.</p><p>There exist multiple incompatible implementations of the test
builtin, which tests files for type and other attributes and
performs arithmetic and string comparisons. POSIX considered none
of these correct, so the standard behavior was specified in terms
of the number of arguments to the command. POSIX.2 dictates exactly
what will happen when four or fewer arguments are given to test,
and leaves</p><p>the behavior undefined when more arguments are supplied. Bash
uses the POSIX.2 algorithm, which was conceived by David
Korn.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec60b0"></a>Features not in the Bourne Shell</h2></div></div><p>There are a number of minor differences between Bash and the
version of sh present on most other versions of Unix. The majority
of these are due to the POSIX standard, but some are the result of
Bash adopting features from other shells. For instance, Bash
includes the new &ldquo;!&rdquo; reserved word, the command builtin, the
ability of the read builtin to correctly return a line ending with
a backslash, symbolic arguments to the umask builtin, variable
substring removal, a way to get the length of a variable, and the
new algorithm for the test builtin from the POSIX.2 standard, none
of which appear in sh.</p><p>Bash also implements the &ldquo;$(...)&rdquo; command substitution
syntax, which replaces the sh `...` construct. The &ldquo;$(...)&rdquo;
construct expands to the output of the command contained within the
parentheses, with trailing newlines removed. The sh syntax is
accepted for backwards compatibility, but the &ldquo;$(...)&rdquo; form is
preferred because its quoting rules are much simpler and it is
easier to nest.</p><p>The Bourne shell does not have such features as brace
expansion, the ability to have a variable and a function with the
same name, local variables in shell functions, the ability to
enable and disable individual builtins or write a function to
replace a builtin, or a means to export a shell function to a child
process.</p><p>Bash has closed a long-standing shell security hole by not
using the $IFS variable to split each word read by the shell, but
splitting only the results of expansion (ksh and the 4.4 BSD sh
have fixed this as well). Useful behavior such as a means to abort
execution of a script read with the &ldquo;.&rdquo; command or automatically
exporting variables in the shell's environment to children is also
not present in the Bourne shell. Bash provides a much more powerful
environment for both interactive use and programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec62c0"></a>Bash-specific Features</h2></div></div><p>This section details a few of the features which make Bash
unique. Most of them provide improved interactive use, but a few
programming improvements are present as well. Full descriptions of
these features can be found in the Bash documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec63c8"></a>Startup Files</h2></div></div><p>Bash executes startup files differently than other shells.
The Bash behavior is a compromise between the csh principle of
startup files with fixed names executed for each shell and the sh
&ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; behavior. An interactive instance of Bash started as a
login shell reads and executes ~/.bash_profile (the file
.bash_profile in the user's home directory), if it exists. An
interactive non-login shell reads and executes ~/.bashrc. A
non-interactive shell (one begun to execute a shell script, for
example) reads no fixed startup file, but uses the value of the
variable $ENV, if set, as the name of a startup file. The ksh
practice of reading $ENV for every shell, with the accompanying
difficulty of defining the proper variables and functions for
interactive and non-interactive shells or having the file read only
for interactive shells, was considered too complex. Ease of use won
out here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec64d0"></a>New Builtin Commands</h2></div></div><p>There are a few builtins which are new or have been extended
in Bash.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The enable builtin allows builtin commands to be
turned on and off arbitrarily. To use the version of echo found in
a user's search path rather than the Bash builtin, &ldquo;enable -n echo&rdquo;
suffices.</p></li><li><p>The help builtin provides quick synopses of the
shell facilities without requiring access to a manual page.</p></li><li><p>Builtin is similar to command in that it bypasses
shell functions and directly executes builtin commands. Access to a
csh-style stack of directories is provided via the pushd, popd and
dirs builtins.</p></li><li><p>Pushd and popd insert and remove directories from
the stack, respectively, and dirs lists the stack contents.</p></li><li><p>On systems that allow fine-grained control of
resources, the ulimit builtin can be used to tune these settings.
Ulimit allows a user to control, among other things, whether core
dumps are to be generated, how much memory the shell or a child
process is allowed to allocate, and how large a file created by a
child process can grow.</p></li><li><p>The suspend command will stop the shell process
when job control is active; most other shells do not allow
themselves to be stopped like that.</p></li><li><p>Type, the Bash answer to which and whence, shows
what will happen when a word is typed as a command:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
$ type export export is a shell builtin $ type -t export builtin $
type bash bash is /bin/bash $ type cd cd is a function cd () {
    builtin cd ${1+"$@"} &amp;&amp; xtitle $HOST: $PWD
}
</pre><p>Various modes tell what a command word is (reserved word,
alias, function, builtin, or file) or which version of a command
will be executed based on a user's search path. Some of this
functionality has been adopted by POSIX.2 and folded into the
command utility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdcd580.0xec6bb0"></a>Editing and Completion</h2></div></div><p>One area in which Bash shines is command line editing. Bash
uses the readline library to read and edit lines when interactive.
Readline is a powerful and flexible input facility that a user can
configure to their own tastes. It allows lines to be edited using
either emacs or vi commands, where those commands are appropriate.
The full capability of emacs is not present-there is no way to
execute a named command with M-x, for instance-but the existing
commands are more than adequate. The vi mode is compliant with the
command line editing standardized by POSIX.2.</p><p>Readline is fully customizable. In addition to the basic
commands and key bindings, the library allows users to define
additional key bindings using a startup file. The inputrc file,
which defaults to the file ~/.inputrc , is read each time readline
initializes, permitting users to maintain a consistent interface
across a set of programs. Readline includes an extensible
interface, so each program using the library can add its own
bindable commands and program-specific key bindings. Bash uses this
facility to add bindings that perform history expansion or shell
word expansions on the current input line.</p><p>Readline interprets a number of variables which further tune
its behavior. Variables exist to control whether or not eight-bit
characters are directly read as input or converted to meta-
prefixed key sequences (a meta-prefixed key sequence consists of
the character with the eighth bit zeroed, preceded by the
meta-prefix character, usually escape, which selects an alternate
keymap), to decide whether to output characters with the eighth bit
set directly or as a meta-prefixed key sequence, whether or not to
wrap to a new screen line when a line being edited is longer than
the screen width, the keymap to which subsequent key bindings
should apply, or even what happens when readline wants to ring the
terminal's bell. All of these variables can be set in the inputrc
file.</p><p>The startup file understands a set of C preprocessor-like
conditional constructs which allow variables or key bindings to be
assigned based on the application using readline, the terminal
currently being used, or the editing mode. Users can add
program-specific bindings to make their lives easier: I have
bindings that let me edit the value of $PATH and double-quote the
current or previous word:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Macros that are convenient for shell interaction $if Bash # edit the
path "\C-xp": "PATH=${PATH}\\C-e\C-a\f\C-f" # prepare to type a quoted
word-insert open and close double quotes # and move to just after the
open quote "\C-x\"": "\"\"\C-b" # Quote the current or previous word
"\C-xq": "\b\"\f\"" $endif
</pre><p>There is a readline command to re-read the file, so users can
edit the file, change some bindings, and begin to use them almost
immediately.</p><p>Bash implements the bind builtin for more dyamic control of
readline than the startup file permits. Bind is used in several
ways. In list mode, it can display the current key bindings, list
all the readline editing directives available for binding, list
which keys invoke a given directive, or output the current set of
key bindings in a format that can be incorporated directly into an
inputrc file. In batch mode, it reads a series of key bindings
directly from a file and passes them to readline. In its most
common usage, bind takes a single string and passes it directly to
readline, which interprets the line as if it had just been read
from the inputrc file. Both key bindings and variable assignments
can appear in the string given to bind.</p><p>The readline library also provides an interface for word
completion. When the completion character (usually TAB) is typed,
readline looks at the word currently being entered and computes the
set of filenames of which the current word is a valid prefix. If
there is only one possible completion, the rest of the characters
are inserted directly, otherwise the common prefix of the set of
filenames is added to the current word. A second TAB character
entered immediately after a non-unique completion causes readline
to list the possible completions; there is an option to have the
list displayed immediately. Readline provides hooks so that
applications can provide specific types of completion before the
default filename completion is attempted. This is quite flexible,
though it is not completely user-programmable. Bash, for example,
can complete filenames, command names (including aliases, builtins,
shell reserved words, shell functions, and executables found in the
file system), shell variables, usernames, and hostnames. It uses a
set of heuristics that, while not perfect, is generally quite good
at determining what type of completion to attempt.</p><p>This article will be continued next month.</p></div></div>
