Checkmarx <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game of Hacks</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
In its new on-line game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game of Hacks</em></span>, Checkmarx allows developers to have fun
while honing their security skills and understanding of the hacker's perspective.
In the game, developers and security professionals test their application
hacking skills, improve their code security know-how and facilitate better
security practices in hope of reducing the amount of vulnerabilities in their
applications. Available for desktop, tablet and mobile, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game of
Hacks</em></span> presents
developers with vulnerable pieces of code and challenges them to identify the
application layer vulnerability as quickly as possible. It even has a two-player
mode allowing head-to-head competition. Players analyze vulnerabilities
including SQL injection, XSS, log forgery, path traversal, parameter tampering
and others in myriad programming languages. Additionally, developers can add
their own questions and vulnerable code to the game in any programming language
highlighting any vulnerabilities, growing the game's scope as more
users join.

Laura Cassell and Alan Gauld's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Projects</em></span> (Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
Python trainers Laura Cassell and Alan Gauld targeted their new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
Projects</em></span> at the Python programmer with basic skills who is ready to start

land, but who still may be intimidated by larger, more complex projects, will find
this book useful. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Projects</em></span> provides a walk-through of the basic setup
for an application and the building and packaging for a library, and explains in
detail the functionalities related to the projects. Topics include maximizing
the power of the standard library modules; finding and utilizing third-party
libraries; creating, packaging and reusing libraries within and across
projects; building multilayered functionality, including networks, data and
user interfaces; and using development environments like virtualenv, pip and
more. Publisher Wrox says that Python developers looking to apply their skills
to real-world challenges will find a goldmine of information and expert insight

AES' CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux and CLEVER Mobile for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux solution from AES addresses the challenge in
cloud-based data centers that an ever-greater amount of traffic is between
servers, preferably Linux-based ones, of course. CleverView is a performance and
availability monitoring solution for Linux, UNIX and System z that has added new
features in its latest v2.3 release. Concurrently, AES released an updated CLEVER
Mobile for Linux so that enterprise knowledge workers can access server
performance and availability details from their mobile devices. The most
noteworthy highlight of CleverView v2.3 is the SMF Host Utility that integrates
Linux/UNIX-monitored metrics with z/OS SMF records, expanding enterprise insight
into performance and availability. Also noteworthy is the real-time notification
of problems leading to increased Linux and UNIX service availability, regardless
of the hardware platform on which Linux or UNIX resides.

Paul Schuytema's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Web Wargame Toolkit</em></span> (Mercury Learning &amp;
Information)</h2></div></div><p>
Paul Schuytema's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Web Wargame Toolkit</em></span> walks readers through the
process of crafting an old-school, turn-based wargame in PHP utilizing the
CodeIgniter application framework. More generally, this is a soup-to-nuts how-to
book for those interested in crafting Web game applications utilizing a basic
LAMP system. The wargame project serves as an exciting context for PHP
programmers looking to gain more in-depth application coding experience. Those
with an interest in game development will learn the coding skills to support
design decisions as they create the game project. The book assumes at least a
beginning level of PHP coding experience, though no previous CodeIgniter or game
development experience is required. Other features of the book-DVD set include
full database design for game data structures, a flexible game map system, a
complete overview of a simple CRUD system and complete, modifiable source code
for the game.
