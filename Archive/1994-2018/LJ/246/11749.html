As I write these words, the end of summer is approaching, and with
it, so is the time for my annual book roundup. As in past years, in this
article, I describe
books that were new to me during the past 12 months, which means
that I might well mention some new ones or ignore others
that simply didn't come to my attention. My interests (professionally,
and for this column) generally are relevant to people involved in Web
development using open-source technologies, but I admit to
veering into other subjects occasionally. And as I have done for the
last few years of this annual roundup, I have expanded my list of
books also to include blogs, podcasts and other resources that may be
of interest to others in the Open Source community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c3580.0x11bb510"></a>
Programming Languages</h2></div></div><p>
Python continues to grow in popularity and for good reason&mdash;it's an
elegant language that is both powerful and easy to learn. I have been
teaching a growing number of Python courses during the past few years
to a variety of audiences&mdash;aspiring Web developers, companies
interested in moving their automation and testing systems into an
open-source high-level language, and also people interested in
learning basic programming techniques and ideas.
</p><p>
The best-known book about Python, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Python</em></span> by veteran
instructor Mark Lutz, recently was released in its 4th edition by
O'Reilly (ISBN 9780596158101). The book has been expanded and improved
in many ways, most importantly with additional information about
Python 3.x. Truth be told, I have yet to encounter a company that is
using Python 3; all of my consulting and training clients still use
Python 2.7. However, there's no doubt that Python 3.x is the future,
and Lutz has done us all a good service by providing such
information.
</p><p>
This is not a book about learning Python, but rather it's meant to be a
reference and in-depth description of how the language works. And at
that, it succeeds. At the same time, I feel like the book is far too
large (at more than 1,600 pages), 400 pages of which are spent
describing TkInter, a GUI toolkit that is included with Python, is
easy to use and is cross-platform. But, it's also extremely ugly and
not particularly popular, in my experience. If you're a Python
programmer though, you'll likely want to have this book on your shelf.
</p><p>
When I'm teaching Python programming classes, my students often ask me
how they can boost the performance of their code. True, I think that
Python, like many other high-level languages, stresses programmer
efficiency over language efficiency. And of course, we know that
worrying about performance too early in a project is asking for
trouble. At the same time, once our program is working, we definitely
want to increase its speed. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python High-Performance
Programming</em></span>,
written by Gabriele Lanaro and published by Packt Press (ISBN
978-1-78328-845-8), aims to solve some of these issues. The book
concentrates on a small number of areas that can be used to increase
performance: benchmarking and profiling (to understand where the
problem is); NumPy's arrays (which are faster, if more limited, than
Python's built-in lists); Cython (which translates Python code into
C); and finally, multiprocessing. The book is relatively short (at 108
pages), but it does provide some of the most common techniques for
increasing program speed. At the same time, I think that some more
basic techniques, such as not using += to iteratively build strings,
would have added something to the book.
</p><p>
The hottest language continues to be JavaScript, if for no other
reason than the very large number of people who have access to
browsers, be it on their computers or their mobile
devices. JavaScript's huge community has been pushing forward with a
variety of techniques and libraries that make development
easier. Moreover, JavaScript is now popular beyond the browser, in
such places as node.js, a server-side framework that uses asynchronous
JavaScript.
</p><p>
It is this first topic that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Async JavaScript</em></span>, written by Trevor
Burnham and published by the Pragmatic Programmers (ISBN
978-1-937785-27-7) addresses. Part of the difficulty that people have when
working with JavaScript is its asynchronous nature. You often set up a
function to be executed later on, when a particular even happens, and
it's frequently tough to remember just how that worked. This book
introduces techniques that will help you build asynchronous
programs that are easier to understand and debug.
</p><p>
Functional programming is a technique that was pushed aside for many
years by object-oriented programming, but it's making a
comeback. Even if you're not using a purely functional programming
language, functional techniques are increasingly important and
useful. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Functional JavaScript</em></span>, written by Michael Fogus and
published by O'Reilly (ISBN 9781449360726), introduces a wide variety
of functional ideas and techniques. I'd say that this book is good
for two types of audiences: those who already know functional
programming and want to see how these ideas can be applied in
JavaScript, as well as the opposite, people who know JavaScript and
are interested in learning functional programming.
</p><p>
If you are new to JavaScript, or if you have been using it only for
Web development and haven't yet learned how it works as a more
general-purpose programming language, you may well want to read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em></span>. The book, written by Marijn Haverbeke and
available on-line at <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net" target="_self">eloquentjavascript.net</a> (and soon to be
published in paper form by No Starch Press), reviews the basics of
JavaScript as a language, ignoring the Web-related aspects until
halfway through the book. So you learn about JavaScript objects,
higher-order functions and even regular expressions, with clear and
interesting examples.
</p><p>
HTML5 is not quite a language, but it certainly represents a
combination of APIs and tools&mdash;most specifically, HTML, JavaScript and
CSS&mdash;that are the standard way to create modern Web
applications. It's quite amazing to see the breadth and depth of
HTML5, as well as the applications that people are creating with it.
If you're reading this column, you're probably not the right
audience for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head First HTML5 Programming</em></span>, which aims to teach the
basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS to people who have little or no
familiarity with those technologies. But if you know of someone who
wants to understand how these things work, it's worth recommending it.
</p><p>
Another non-language is Git, which has become one of my favorite and
most indispensable tools. It's hard to believe that I used to be
content with CVS and SVN, given the advantages that Git brings to the
table. I must admit that many years ago, a friend of mine said that I
eventually would switch to a distributed version-control system, which
would make life so much easier. He was right, although he was
recommending a system that preceded Git known as Arch, which I don't
believe is used any longer.
</p><p>
I frequently teach courses in the use of Git, and I've found that the
problem for most users is not the commands, but rather the
understanding of what Git does (and doesn't do) and how the various
objects work together. In particular, an understanding of what a commit
is, and how branches, tags, blobs and trees fit into this
commit-centric view of the world, is the biggest obstacle to working
with Git.
</p><p>
So, I was happy to see the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Git Pocket Guide</em></span>, written by Richard
E. Silverman and published by O'Reilly (ISBN 9781449325862). Yes, this
book will help you use Git better, and it will remind you of many of
the commands. But more significant, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Git Pocket
Guide</em></span> introduces
you to the objects Git uses and describes how they work together
to provide a robust and efficient version-control system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c3580.0x11bbe00"></a>
Databases and Analysis</h2></div></div><p>
The growth of the Web has led not only to a growing need for people
who can create Web applications, but also for those who can store,
retrieve and analyze the data generated by those applications. The
term &ldquo;big data&rdquo; increasingly is applied to such programs, and a number
of books have been written in the past few years that attempt to help
newcomers to the field.
</p><p>
In some cases, you don't need to collect or analyze the data yourself.
Rather, you can get by just using the APIs that various systems have
provided. This is particularly the case with social networks, which
collect enormous quantities of information about their members and
the connections between them. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mining the Social Web</em></span>, by Matthew
A. Russell, was released in its second edition (ISBN 9781449367619),
and it describes many ways in which you can access and analyze different
social networks. I've played with such APIs in the past, so I 
wasn't new to their use in my applications, but this book described
a number of uses I didn't think of, with lots of clear example
code that illuminated the points.
</p><p>
For those who want to analyze large data sets more directly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doing
Data Science</em></span>, by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt and published by
O'Reilly (ISBN 9781449358655), is a dense, but interesting,
introduction to the techniques that are collectively known as &ldquo;Data
Science&rdquo;. The authors give a whirlwind tour of the math and
algorithms used in such analysis and also the types of conclusions
you can draw from its use. Some of this book was a bit heavy for my
needs and interests, but it gave me a much better sense of what the
Data Science people are doing, and how it is already becoming
useful. I should note that Cathy O'Neil, one of the co-authors of this
book, is a participant in the new &ldquo;Slate Money&rdquo; podcast. If you want
to hear financial analysis driven by big data, you might want to tune
in to that weekly recording.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c3580.0x11bc170"></a>
Freelancing and Business</h2></div></div><p>
I've been a freelance consultant since 1995, working with clients
around the world, and I really enjoy my work. I even participate in a
weekly podcast, &ldquo;The Freelancers Show&rdquo;, in which panelists discuss
different aspects of what it's like to be self-employed.
</p><p>
Two of my co-panelists from the show have come out with eBooks during
the past year. Curtis McHale wrote <span   class="emphasis"><em>Don't Be an Idiot: Learn to Run a
Viable Freelance Business</em></span>
(<a href="http://curtismchale.ca/products/run-viable-freelance-business" target="_self">curtismchale.ca/products/run-viable-freelance-business</a>),
which gives
practical advice for starting and running a successful freelance
business. Along the same lines, Eric Davis has a practical, day-by-day
plan for you to start on the freelancing track, in his <span   class="emphasis"><em>30 Days to
Become a Freelancer</em></span> (<a href="http://theadmin.org/30-days-become-freelancer" target="_self">theadmin.org/30-days-become-freelancer</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c3580.0x11bc488"></a>
Other Books</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, I don't read only technical books, although my friends and
family might not quite believe that claim. I have read a number of
excellent books in the past year that I think you all might enjoy.
</p><p>
Tim Harford is a well-known economics writer and has published
numerous books on the subject. His most recent, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Undercover
Economist Strikes Back</em></span>, describes how macroeconomics and government
policies work, and the various theories that economists have used to
try to understand these policies and their effects. I have long had
an interest in economics, but still very much enjoyed reading this
book, which shed new light on the differences between various schools
of economics.
</p><p>
Another favorite writer of mine, Tom Standage, came out with a new
book this year: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Writing on the Wall: Social Media&mdash;The First 2,000
Years</em></span>. Standage's argument is that just about every type of social
media and technology that we use nowadays has precedents in previous
cultures. His funny and interesting book is sure to give you some
perspective on Facebook and LinkedIn, among other things.
</p><p>
Another great book that came out this year is <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Not to Be Wrong:
The Power of Mathematical Thinking</em></span>, by Jordan Ellenberg. Ellenberg
is a mathematics professor, and he tries to show in this book how
mathematical thinking can help you make useful decisions. He starts
the book by pointing out that &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo; isn't what you learned in
elementary and high school, and it succeeds in having very few equations
in the book. Rather, his point is to show how it's a perspective on
life that can help you make decisions or persuade others. To
his credit, the author also includes a number of examples of where
mathematics cannot really provide a clear-cut answer, such as (most
surprisingly) in deciding election results.
</p><p>
As readers of this column know, I have traveled to China several times
in the past few years to teach Ruby and Python programming classes.
And, I've become something of an aficionado of China-related books
written by reporters who were there. Evan Osnos, who was the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New
Yorker</em></span>'s correspondent in China for several years, published a book
this year titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the
New China</em></span> that tries to make sense of the political and social
changes happening in China. Along the same lines, I'm enjoying Howard
French's book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>China's Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are
Building a New Empire in Africa</em></span>, which describes the experiences and
interactions of Chinese expatriates in various African countries.
</p><p>
Finally, as someone who recently finished a PhD, I can recommend a
funny (if rather cynical) book: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Surviving Your Stupid, Stupid
Decision to Go to Grad School</em></span>, by Adam Ruben. Perhaps it's easier to
laugh at his jokes now that I've completed the degree, but I found it
not only funny but also therapeutic to know that others had
experienced similar problems and challenges to mine during their
grad-school careers.
</p><p>
I hope these recommendations will provide you with many hours of
insightful and interesting reading! I'm sure I have missed many good books
that came out in the past year; I'm always open to hearing about them
and welcome your suggestions.
