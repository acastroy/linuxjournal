Linux inside, Linux inside, every single one of us has Linux inside! (Sung
to the tune of &ldquo;Devil Inside&rdquo; by INXS&mdash;you're welcome for the ear worm, I
can't get it out of my head either.)
</p><p>
In the world of embedded systems, systems-on-chip and single-purpose
hardware solutions, it's easier to list the products that don't have Linux
as their operating system! This month, we focus on putting Linux into tiny
places, and that means everything from the tiniest &ldquo;Android
Wear&rdquo; watch to
the ubiquitous Raspberry Pi. As Linux users, we've been sneaking open
source into server rooms for decades. Now we get to sneak it in everywhere!
</p><p>
This issue starts with Reuven M. Lerner discussing the books he's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>embedded</em></span> into his bookshelf this year. Month after month, Reuven gives us
incredible tips, techniques and training for programmers and neophytes
like myself. Now we get a glimpse at some of the books he uses
for learning himself. Whether you want advice on language books, database
books or even some information on freelancing, Reuven shares his stash. If
you're looking for your next book to read (after this issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, of course), check out his column.
</p><p>
Dave Taylor begins a new adventure, this time attempting to parse
the written word and grammar with scripts. It's always fascinating to see
tasks that are simple for humans attempted by programs and logic. Dave's
column is more than just instructive, it will force you to think as well!
Speaking of thinking, the title of Kyle Rankin's column this month will
make you think hard. &ldquo;Return of the Mac&rdquo; seems like the exact opposite of
what Kyle would write about. And, of course, he doesn't talk about an Apple
product. I won't give it away, but don't worry, Kyle hasn't given up the
command line for the GUI world of Apple&mdash;in fact, quite the opposite.
</p><p>
I put on my grey hat this month and talk a little bit about SSH.
&ldquo;Hacking&rdquo;
is a word that is used to describe far too many things, most of which I
think are more accurately described as, &ldquo;Using Things Like They Were Made
To Be Used&rdquo;, but that's not as catchy for a movie title. Firewalls are
important security tools for any network, but it's important to realize
that firewalls can't be your only defense against access. This month I show
you why. Do I &ldquo;hack&rdquo; the firewall? I don't think so, but for someone
unfamiliar with SSH tunneling, it sure looks like it.
</p><p>
Al Audet shows how to embed Linux into a hole in the ground this month.
More specifically, he explains how he uses a Raspberry Pi device to monitor
the sump hole in his basement to avoid flooding. Sump pumps are amazing
devices&mdash;until they're not. Al shares not only his method, but also his
scripts for controlling a sensor that warns him if the water level rises
too much. It's the perfect example of solving difficult problems with
Linux. Sachin Verma goes even deeper (pun intended) and shows how to
deal with the bootloader on embedded Linux systems. U-Boot is commonly used
in such environments, and along with booting the kernel, you can pass
environment variables as well. Sachin walks through the boot process
and teaches how to customize the information passed on at boot.
</p><p>
Finally, Samuel Bucquet gives a crash course in accessing the BeagleBone
Black's I/O ports via Python. Although the Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black
are both excellent platforms for embedded projects, the BBB's sheer number
of I/O options make it incredible for projects with a large number of
sensor needs. With Samuel's help, you can access those ports with the
friendly and familiar Python language.

The Embedded issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> always makes me want to build
something. Now that BirdCam is off-line (the battery in my old Android phone
blew up&mdash;it was ugly), maybe it's time to start over from scratch. I'm
sure there are some great weatherproof IP cameras out there I could use to
get better shots of the winter birds. Either way, this is a great issue,
and we had a great time putting together for you. Whether you want tech
tips, programming ideas or just my silly insight on the best new apps for
your phone, the October issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> aims to please!
