Dave has to fight a fire with shell scripts when he migrates his ten-year-old Web site onto a new content management system!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac3580.0x1bbb358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I know, I'm in the middle of a series of columns about how to work
with ImageMagick on the command line, but when other things arise, well, I
imagine that a lot of you are somehow involved in the management
of servers or systems, so you all understand firefighting.
</p><p>
Of course, this means you all also understand the negative feedback
loop that is an intrinsic part of system administration and IT management.
I mean, people don't call you and the CEO doesn't send a memo saying,
&ldquo;system worked all day, printer even printed. Thanks!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Nope, it's when things go wrong that you hear about them, and that
propensity to ignore the good and have to deal with the bad when it crops
up is not only a characteristic of being in corporate IT, it's just as
true if you're running your own system&mdash;which is how it jumped out of the pond and bit me this month.
</p><p>
It all started ten years ago with my Ask Dave Taylor site. You've
probably bumped into it (<a href="http://www.AskDaveTaylor.com" target="_self">www.AskDaveTaylor.com</a>), as it's
been around for more than a decade and served helpful tutorial information for
tens of millions of visitors in that period.
</p><p>
Ten years ago, the choice of Movable Type as my blogging platform made
total sense and was a smart alternative to the raw, unfinished WordPress
platform with its never-ending parade of hacks and problems. As every
corporate IT person knows, however, sometimes you get locked in to the
wrong platform and are then stuck, with the work required to migrate
becoming greater and greater each month nothing happens.
</p><p>
For the site's tenth anniversary, therefore, it was time. I had to
bite the bullet and migrate all 3,800 articles and 56,000 comments from
Movable Type to WordPress, because yes, WordPress won and is clearly the
industry standard for content management systems today.
</p><p>
The task was daunting, not just because of the size of the import (it
required the consulting team rewriting the standard import tool to work
with that many articles and comments), but because the naming scheme
changed. On Movable Type, I'd always had it set to convert the
article's name into a URL like this:
</p><p>
Name: Getting Started with Pinterest
</p><p>
URL: /getting_started_with_pinterest.html
</p><p>
That was easy and straightforward, but on WordPress, URLs have dashes, not
underscores,
and, more important, they don't end with .html because
they're generated dynamically as needed. This means the default
URL for the new WordPress site would look like this:
</p><p>
New URL: /getting-started-with-pinterest/
</p><p>
URLs can be mapped upon import so that the default dashes become
underscores, but it was the suffix that posed a problem, and post-import
there were 3,800 URLs that were broken because every single link to
xx_xx.html failed.
</p><p>
Ah! A 301 redirect! Yes, but thousands of redirects slow down the
server for everyone, so a rewrite rule is better. Within Apache, you can
specify &ldquo;if you see a URL of the form xx_xx.html, rewrite it to
'xx_xx' and try again&rdquo;, a darn handy capability.
</p><p>
But life is never that easy, because although this rewrite will work for 95%
of the URLs on the old site, there were some that just ended up with a
different URL because I'd monkeyed with things somewhere along the
way. Yeah, there's always something.
</p><p>
For example, the old site URL
/schedule_facebook_photo_upload_fan_page.html
is now on the server with the URL
/schedule-a-facebook-photo-upload-to-my-fan-page/.
</p><p>
That's helpful, right? (Sigh.)
</p><p>
These all can be handled with a 301 redirect, but the question is, out of
almost 4,000 article URLs on the old site, which ones don't actually
successfully map with the rewrite rule (.html to a trailing
slash) to a page on the new server?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac3580.0x1bbbc48"></a>
Finally Some Scripting</h2></div></div><p>
To identify these rewrite fails, I had to create a script&mdash;and fast. After
all, while the internal linkages still might work, the thousands of
external links from sites like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Popular Science</em></span>, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> and elsewhere were not broken. Yikes&mdash;not good at all.
</p><p>
I started out on the command line with one that I knew failed. Here's what
happened when I used curl to grab a bad URL on the new site:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ curl
http://www.askdavetaylor.com/
&#8618;schedule-facebook-photo-upload-to-my-fan-page.html
| head -5

% Total  % Received % Xferd  Average Speed  Time  Time  Time Current
                             Dload  Upload  Total Spent Left Speed
0     0  0    0     0     0      0     0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--
0&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Nothing found for
Schedule-A-Facebook-Photo-Upload-To-My-Fan-Page&lt;/title&gt;
100 31806   0 31806  0   0  110k  0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 110k
curl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 754)
</pre>
</p><p>
Ugh, what a mess this is, and it's not surprising because I forgot to
add the <tt  >-silent</tt> flag to <tt  >curl</tt> when I invoked it.
</p><p>
Still, there's enough displayed here to provide a big clue. It's a
404 error page, as expected, and the &lt;title&gt; indicates just that:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;title&gt;Nothing found for ...

</pre>
</p><p>
So that's an easy pattern to search for:

<pre     class="programlisting">

curl -silent URL | grep '&lt;title&gt;Nothing found for'

</pre>
</p><p>
That does the trick. If the output is non-zero, the link failed and
generated a 404 error, but if the link worked, it'll be the proper
title of the article, and the words &ldquo;Nothing found for&rdquo; will
appear.
</p><p>
That's most of the needed logic for the script. The only other step is
to simulate the rewrite rule so that all the links that do work aren't
flagged as a problem. Easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
newname="$(echo $name | sed 's/\.html/\//')"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is a super-common sequence that I use in scripts, actually with a
subshell invocation <tt  >$( )</tt> echoing a variable's current value, just to
push it through a <tt  >sed</tt> substitution, in this case replacing
.html with a trailing slash (which needs to be escaped with a
leading backslash, hence the complexity of the pattern).
</p><p>
Wrap this in a for loop that steps through all possible *.html files, and
here's what it looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in *.html ; do
  newname="$(echo $name | sed 's/\.html/\//')"
  test=$($curl $base/$newname | grep "$pattern")
  if [ -n "$test" ]
  then
    echo "* URL $base/$name fails to resolve."
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
That's boring though, because while I'm at it, I'd like to
know how many URLs were tested and how many errors were
encountered. I
mean, why not, right? Quantification = good.
</p><p>
It's easily added, as it turns out, with the addition of two new variables
(both of which need to be set to zero at the top of the script):

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in *.html ; do
  newname="$(echo $name | sed 's/\.html/\//')"
  test=$($curl $base/$newname | grep "$pattern")
  if [ -n "$test" ] ; then
    echo "* URL $base/$name fails to resolve."
    error=$(( $error + 1 ))
  fi
  count=$(( $count + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Then at the very end of the script, after all the specific errors are
reported, a status update:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo ""; echo "Checked $count links, found $error problems."
</pre>
</p><p>
Great. Let's run it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bad-links.sh | tail -5

* URL http://www.askdavetaylor.com/whats_a_fast_way_to_add_a_
&#8618;store_and_shopping_cart_to_my_site.html fails to resolve.

* URL http://www.askdavetaylor.com/whats_amazons_simple_
&#8618;storage_solution_s3.html fails to resolve.

* URL http://www.askdavetaylor.com/whats_my_yahoo_
&#8618;account_password_1.html fails to resolve.

* URL http://www.askdavetaylor.com/youtube_video_
&#8618;missing_hd_resolution.html fails to resolve.

Checked 3658 links, found 98 problems.
</pre>
</p><p>
Phew. Now I know the special cases and can apply custom 301 redirects to
fix them. By the time you read this article, all will be well on the site
(or better be).
</p><p>
Next month, back to ImageMagick, I promise&mdash;unless another fire erupts that I have to solve.
