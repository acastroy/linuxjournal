Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we love system administrators.
Partially, that's
because many of us <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> system administrators, but more than that, we all
realize just how important sysadmins are to any organization&mdash;and how
overlooked they usually are. This year, we decided to make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> system
administration-focused issues, because that's how much we care. (Also
because system administration is one of the more popular topics, and a
large percentage of our readers do some sort of sysadmin work. But, we do
care. Really.)
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts off the issue with some awesome information about
PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails. With the latest version of Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL has
been integrated more closely than ever before. In a nerdy version of the
&ldquo;your chocolate is in my peanut butter&rdquo; situation, Ruby on Rails is now far
more yummy. Dave Taylor, on the other hand, 
whips out his scripting Kung-fu to update all the old URLs that broke when
updating his content management system. CMSes are wonderful when it comes
to delivering content, but moving between systems means dealing with the
differences in how they create paths. Rahter than repost every article he's
ever written, Dave modifies the URLs with scripts. And, he shows us how he
does it.

Kyle Rankin and I both look at the lighter side of system
administration this month. We didn't plan it, but perhaps it's a sign that
every sysadmin needs a break from time to time. I covered my adventures
with a CuBox computer, which is more powerful than a Raspberry Pi and
about the size of a large ice cube. Whether you need a power-efficient
server or a sleek XBMC unit with built-in IR, the CuBox is cool enough
that I had to share. Kyle takes another stab at the Raspberry Pi this
month, and he describes how to turn the little beasties into gaming machines.
No, not those fancy new first-person-shooter type games, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> games,
like the Nintendo Entertainment System. Get your nostalgia primed, and
check out Kyle's experience with RetroPie. (And say goodbye to your
weekend!)
</p><p>
Alex Davies and Alessandro Orsaria bring us back into the server room with
their article on GlusterFS. As cloud computing drives bigger and bigger
data centers, sometimes in our own server rooms, GlusterFS is one popular
and powerful way to provide a distributed filesystem. Although many of us
remember expanding storage by notching out the corner of a floppy disk,
these days, petabytes of data can reside seamlessly across multiple
servers. Alex and Alessandro explain how. Dariusz Suchojad follows them
with his article on Zato, which is a platform for integrating Python into the
cloud.
</p><p>
Next up this issue is SIDUS, which stands for Single-Instance Distributing
Universal System. Emmanuel Quemener and Marianne Corvellec introduce us to
this unique system that drastically reduces maintenance and installation
time for new computer workstations. Not quite LTSP and not quite a fat
client installation, SIDUS allows for the reuse of an operating system over
the network. It's a fascinating concept and well worth the read. Then we
finish the issue off with a special report on OpenStack. Every system
administrator out there has at least heard of OpenStack, and in this
report, Tom Fitfield provides a crash course in the technology. Whether
you're an old hand or a newbie, Tom's information is invaluable to anyone
interested in cloud computing.
</p><p>
We also have our regular assortment of product announcements, reviews, 
tips and vendor information in this issue. Heck, we even hand-pick our ads
to find information that will be interesting and useful to our readers.
Whether you're a system administrator or just an avid fan of Linux, this
issue should entertain and inform. As for me, I'm planning to eat dessert
first and give RetroPie a try. If my boss complains, I'll just blame Kyle.
