<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>stable kernel series</b></span> recently got bit by an over-eagerness to accept
patches. Typically, the rule had been that <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> wouldn't
accept patches that had not gotten into <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>' development kernel
first. People sometimes complained that this was absurd, since the patches
in question always were intended for the stable tree, and so it seemed to
make no sense to wait for them to be accepted into a completely different,
development-centric tree. But the rule existed to ensure that the good and
useful stabilization patches wouldn't go only into the ephemeral stable
releases, but also would be incorporated into the long-term future of the
kernel (that is, Linus' tree).
</p><p>
Nevertheless, sometimes people complained. And, Greg did try to take patches
as soon as they crossed the threshold into Linus' git repository. But
recently he did this with a <span   class="bold"><b>genetlink</b></span> patch that seemed fine at first, but
it ended up having a bad interaction with other code that wasn't caught
until after the 3.0.92 stable kernel came out.
</p><p>
Greg viewed this as a bit of a wake-up call to slow down on accepting
patches until they were not only in Linus's tree, but also had a chance to
be tested for the duration of one -rc cycle. That would provide a much better
chance of shaking out any bugs and keep the stable kernels as stable as
one might reasonably expect.
</p><p>
Linus pointed out that tying the waiting period to an -rc cycle was fairly
arbitrary. He said waiting a week or so probably would be fine. He also
added that for particularly critical or well-discussed patches, a delay
probably would be unnecessary.
</p><p>
Greg posted a more formal description of his new patch-acceptance policy,
which also specified that if an official maintainer signed off on the
patch, or if Greg saw a sufficient amount of discussion about it, or for
that matter, if the patch was just obvious, then the delay for acceptance
could be skipped.
</p><p>
Greg's initial proposal also included his idea of waiting for a full -rc
cycle. <span   class="bold"><b>Nicholas A. Bellinger</b></span> had no
problem with that, and <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span>
said that even waiting for a full dot release would be fine. But Greg
vetoed that, saying three months would be too long.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Josh Boyer</b></span> offered to help out in some way, and Greg said it would be
useful to know when things were broken. He said, &ldquo;Right now, that doesn't
seem to happen much, so either not much is breaking, or I'm just not told
about it, I don't know which.&rdquo; So Josh volunteered to send any such
information he collected as part of his work on <span   class="bold"><b>Fedora</b></span> to Greg. Greg said
this would be great. Greg also suggested that patches going into
distribution kernels also should be sent to him as a matter of course,
&ldquo;as
those obviously are things that are needed for a valid reason that everyone
should be able to benefit from.&rdquo;
</p><p>
At some point in the discussion, Linus came back and again recommended that
Greg just wait a week to accept patches, rather than wait for an -rc
release. Linus pointed out that some people did test the bleeding-edge git
kernels, and there at least should be some encouragement for them to keep
doing so.
</p><p>
This led to a discussion of whether people actually should run the git
kernels in between -rc releases. <span   class="bold"><b>Borislav
Petkov</b></span> suggested that at any
point in time the raw git tree would be fairly arbitrary and possibly
broken. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Tony Luck</b></span> said that if the git tree never got any testing, 
all the arbitrariness and breakage simply would cascade forward into the
-rc release.
</p><p>
It does seem as though Greg will be more careful about when patches go into
the stable tree, and hopefully, some new people will start testing the raw
git kernels.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>device tree</b></span> (DT) bindings have begun a
major overhaul. <span   class="bold"><b>Grant Likely</b></span>
announced that maintainership would be changing to a group model to keep
up with the pace of change in that area. He asked for volunteers to join
in, and he said that the entire schema for specifying DT bindings will be
revised.
</p><p>
DT bindings are generalized, machine-parsable descriptions of certain
aspects of hardware. They make it possible for the kernel code to be
somewhat more generic and avoid the need to hard-code a lot of hardware-specific
details. It makes for a much cleaner and more readable kernel.
</p><p>
Grant said that <span   class="bold"><b>Tomasz Figa</b></span> was going to be leading the work on revising
the DT schema. This, he said, hopefully would result in something that
could be validated programmatically, while at the same time being human-readable, in order to double as documentation.
</p><p>
The development process itself also will change. At the time of Grant's
announcement, the process had become too frantic, and there was no
distinction between DT bindings that were clearly stable and those that
were in flux and still under development.
</p><p>
Tomasz suggested having a clear process for migrating any given DT binding
from a staging area into a stable area. Once stable, he said, they should
have the sanctity of an application binary interface (ABI), which typically
must never be allowed to break backward compatibility.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Gibson</b></span> also was very interested in this project. He'd made an earlier
attempt at schema validation, and he wanted to see if Tomasz could fare
better. He also pointed out that there was a perception problem among
users, and that they tended to think that a given DT binding&mdash;as being
distributed in the kernel&mdash;was valid for that kernel and no others. But
David said this was not the case, and that some effort should be made to
inform users that DT bindings are intended to be generalized descriptions
of hardware and not tied to any particular kernel version. But, he wasn't
sure how that could be done.
</p><p>
The discussion took many paths. At some point, someone suggested using
<span   class="bold"><b>XML</b></span>
with a corresponding document type definition as the DT schema. There was
some support for this, but Tomasz didn't like mixing XML with the existing
DT schema format.
</p><p>
The overarching discussion was open-ended, but clearly there are big
changes on the way, regarding the DT-binding specifications.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Flickr Uploader</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As luck would have it, shortly after I purchased a Flickr Pro
subscription, Yahoo decided to eliminate the pay-for option with Flickr
and give everyone a free Terabyte of space to store photos. Although I'm
still not convinced Flickr is the best way to store photos, I have
found it to be very flexible, so for now, my family members dump all their
photos to Flickr from all their devices. (And then I back them up with
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flickrbackup" target="_self">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flickrbackup</a> because I'm
paranoid.)
</p><p>
On my phone, a Galaxy S4, I find it cumbersome to upload photos directly
to Flickr, so I bought Flickr Uploader from the Google Play store,
and now all my photos are uploaded to Flickr instantly when I take
them. Options are available to limit uploading to Wi-Fi only,
or to upload only certain kinds of photos (camera photos but not
screenshots, for example). The application is $4.99, but the developer
has created &ldquo;coupons&rdquo; to get the application for a huge discount or
even free (<a href="https://github.com/rafali/flickr-uploader/wiki/Coupons" target="_self">https://github.com/rafali/flickr-uploader/wiki/Coupons</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577flickrf1.large.jpg"><img src="11577flickrf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I find the application to be smooth, stable and incredibly
convenient. It's important to realize, however, that if
you're the sort of person to take personal or compromising
photos, double- and triple-check your settings to make sure
you don't upload publicly viewable shots automatically! If
you're a Flickr user, check out Flickr Uploader today:

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Chrome Desktop Applications</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Hopefully by the time you're reading this, Chrome Desktop Applications
will be available for Linux. In the meantime, this is a Windows treat. The
ability to make a &ldquo;single-purpose&rdquo; browser has been around
Chrome/Chromium
for a long time, but with the new breed of Chrome Applications, the
browser is a base for a standalone, off-line application. According to
Google, the new Chrome apps will have the following features (from
<a href="http://snar.co/chromeapps" target="_self">snar.co/chromeapps</a>):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Work off-line: keep working or playing, even when you don't have an
Internet connection.
</p></li><li><p>
More app, less Chrome: no tabs, buttons or text boxes.
</p></li><li><p>
Connect to the cloud: access and save the documents locally and in the cloud.
</p></li><li><p>
Desktop notifications: you can get reminders, updates and even take action,
right from the notification center.
</p></li><li><p>
Local device support: interact with your USB, Bluetooth and other devices.
</p></li><li><p>
Automatic updates: apps update silently (unless permissions change).
</p></li><li><p>
Chrome App Launcher: appears on the taskbar when you install your first new
Chrome App.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11577fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Chrome dabbles with off-line abilities with many of its current Web
applications, but with the new Chrome Apps, this should go to an entire
new level. If the hype is correct, these should be local applications,
not just Web apps with off-line hooks. Also, although Chrome Apps are
Windows-only today, Google promises Linux support in the future.

<h2 class="title">FreeMat&mdash;Yet Another MATLAB Replacement</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many programs exist that try to serve as a replacement for
MATLAB. They all differ in their capabilities&mdash;some extending beyond
what is available in MATLAB, and others giving subsets of functions that
focus on some problem area. In this article, let's look at another
available option: FreeMat. 
</p><p>
The main Web site for FreeMat is hosted
on SourceForge. Installation for most Linux distributions should be
as easy as using your friendly neighborhood package manager. FreeMat
also is available as source code, as well as installation packages for
Windows and Mac OS X. Once it's installed, you can go ahead and start
it up. This brings up the main window with a working console that
should be displaying the license information for FreeMat (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577freef1.large.jpg"><img src="11577freef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start up FreeMat, you are given a fresh console.
</p></div></div><p>
As with most programs like FreeMat, you can do arithmetic right away. All
of the arithmetic operations are overloaded to do &ldquo;the
right thing&rdquo; automatically, based on the data types of the operands. The core data
types include integers (8, 16 and 32 bits, both signed and unsigned),
floating-point numbers (32 and 64 bits) and complex numbers (64 and 128
bits). Along with those, there is a core data structure, implemented as
an N-dimensional array. The default value for N is 6, but is arbitrary.
Also, FreeMat supports heterogeneous arrays, where different elements are
actually different data types. 
</p><p>
Commands in FreeMat are line-based. This
means that a command is finished and executed when you press the Enter
key. As soon as you do, the command is run, and the output is displayed
immediately within your console. You should notice that results that are
not saved to a variable are saved automatically to a temporary variable
named &ldquo;ans&rdquo;. You can use this temporary variable to access and reuse
the results from previous commands. For example, if you want to find
the volume of a cube of side length 3, you could so with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; 3 * 3
ans =
 9
--&gt; ans * 3
ans =
 27   
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, a much faster way would be to do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; 3 * 3 * 3
ans =
 27
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, you could do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; 3^3
ans =
 27
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't want to clutter up your console with the output from
intermediate calculations, you can tell FreeMat to hide that output by
adding a semicolon to the end of the line. So, instead of this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; sin(10)
ans =
   -0.5440
</pre>
</p><p>
you would get this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; sin(10);
--&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Assignment in FreeMat is done with the equals operator (=). Variable
names are untyped, so you can reuse the same name for different data
types in different parts of your worksheet. For example, you can store
the value of tan(10) in the variable a, and the value of 2 times a in
the variable b, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; a = tan(10)
a =
    0.6484
--&gt; b = 2 * a
b =
    1.2967
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the variables active in your current session are
all listed in the variable window on the left-hand side (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577freef2.large.jpg"><img src="11577freef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. All of the current variables, along with their values and data types,
are listed in the variable window.
</p></div></div><p>
The arithmetic operators are overloaded when it comes to interacting
with arrays too. For example, let's say you want to take all of
the elements of an array and double them. In a lower-level language,
like C or Fortran, you would need to write a fair bit of code to handle
looping through each element and multiplying it by 2. In FreeMat, this
is as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
a =
 1 2 3 4
--&gt; a * 2
ans =
 2 4 6 8
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are used to something like NumPY in the Python programming
language, this should seem very familiar. Indexing arrays is done with
brackets. FreeMat uses 1-based indexes, so if you wanted to get the
second value, you would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; a(2)
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can set the value at a particular index using the same
notation. So you would change the value of the third element with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; a(3) = 5
</pre>
</p><p>
These arrays all need to have the same data type. If you have need of
a heterogeneous list of elements, this is called a cell array. Cell
arrays are defined using curly braces. So, you could set up a name and
phone-number matrix using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; phone = { 'Name1', 5551223; 'name2', 5555678 }
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two new pieces of syntax introduced here. The first is how you
define a string. In FreeMat, strings are denoted with a set of single
quotation marks. So this cell array has two strings in it. The second new
syntax item is the use of a semicolon in the definition of your
array. This tells FreeMat that you're moving to a new row. In essence,
you're now creating a matrix instead of an array.
</p><p>
Plotting in FreeMat is similar to plotting in R or matplotlib. Graphics
functions are broken down into high-level and low-level functions. The
most basic high-level function is plot(). This function is overloaded
to try to do the right thing based on the input. A basic example would
be plotting a sine function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; t = -63:64;
--&gt; signal = sin(2*pi*t/32);
--&gt; plot(t, signal)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will pop up a new window to contain the results of the plot
function (Figure 3). You then can use low-level functions to alter
these plots. For example, you can set the title of your graph with
the function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; title('This is my plot')
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577freef3.large.jpg"><img src="11577freef3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Plots are generated and displayed in their own window.
</p></div></div><p>
There are low-level functions to alter almost all of the elements of
your plots.
</p><p>
One process that FreeMat tries to excel at is making the importation of
external code easy on the end user. The import function is used to import
a function from an external library and make it available to be used just
like any other FreeMat function. The signature of the import function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import(libraryname,symbol,function,return,arguments)
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, if you have some piece of code that is already written and
tuned in C to get the maximum performance, you simply can import it and
use it from within FreeMat with very little fuss.
</p><p>
Since FreeMat is as capable as MATLAB or Octave, you can assume that
I've barely covered everything offered by FreeMat here. Hopefully, you have
seen enough to spark your interest and will make some time to
go and explore even more.

<h2 class="title">Valve&mdash;It Really <span class="emphasis"><em>Does</em></span> Love Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've teased about Steam, speculated about Steam and even bragged about
Steam finally coming to Linux. Heck, check out the screenshot for just a partial
list of games already running natively under our beloved OS. Little
did I know that the folks at Valve not only planned to support Linux,
but they're also putting a big part of their future behind it as well!
</p><p>
Valve recently announced SteamOS
(<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS" target="_self">store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS</a>), which
is a Linux-based operating system designed from the ground
up to play games. Steam games. The operating system will be
free, and it also will be the OS running on Valve's next big thing,
SteamMachines (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines" target="_self">store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines</a>).
Although the hardware won't be available until sometime in 2014, the OS
should be out before then.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577gamef1.large.jpg"><img src="11577gamef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Will Valve be the company to bridge the gap between computer gaming
and console gaming? Will PC games translate to a television screen
smoothly? Will the SteamOS's &ldquo;game streaming&rdquo; technology effectively
bring the entire Steam library to Linux? I've learned enough not to
make any predictions, but I can tell you it's an exciting prospect,
and it's even more exciting because it's all running on Linux!

<h2 class="title">Fight the Good Fight with SmokePing</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #235, November 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My Internet connection is unstable. I do realize ISPs generally claim
some downtime is expected, and service is not guaranteed, and countless
other excuses are common for intermittent service. I currently pay
$120/month for business-class service, however, and I expect to get
reliable Internet access on a regular basis. The most frustrating part
is that the folks at my ISP don't believe I'm having intermittent problems, because
every time they look, it seems fine.
</p><p>
Enter SmokePing.
</p><p>
With past ISP problems, I've been able to run a continuous ping to an
outside IP address and show the tech-support representative that I
have packet loss. Unfortunately, a running ping command doesn't give a
history of <span   class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span> the packets are lost. With SmokePing, not only is there
a record of when packets are lost, but there's also a graphical representation
of how many packets were lost, and from several IP addresses to boot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11577smokef1.large.jpg"><img src="11577smokef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Notice packet loss to the Google DNS server, but none to my
gateway. So, the problem isn't with my house connection.
</p></div></div><p>
For my purposes, I keep track of pings to my local router, to the
gateway provided by my ISP, and then a Google IP address and a foreign
IP address. With that information, I usually not only can tell the ISP
when the packets drop, but also whether it's an issue between me and its
gateway or routing somewhere past my subnet. (For what it's worth,
the problem is almost <span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> between my router and my
ISP's gateway,
because there's some problem with its line coming to my office.)
</p><p>
If you need to prove packet loss, or if you just like to keep track of potential
problems between hosts, SmokePing is an awesome uptime tracker that comes
with colorful graphs and lots of useful information. For its incredible
usefulness and straightforward approach to monitoring, SmokePing gets
this month's Editors' Choice Award. Check it out at <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping" target="_self">oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping</a>.
