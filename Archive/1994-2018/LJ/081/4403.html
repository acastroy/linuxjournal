volume <span   class="emphasis"><em>un petit peu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ah, merci</em></span>. Monsieur Debussy was in fine form
when he wrote that, eh, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>? Wonderful.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>C'est de la tres belle musique,
Fran&ccedil;ois?</em></span> Ah, it is like that Englishman,
Shakespeare, who despite being English, certainly got it right when
he said, &ldquo;If music be the food of love, play on.&rdquo; Of course, food
requires the right wine and with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pell&eacute;as et
M&eacute;lisande</em></span> playing in the background, I sense a
Medoc may well be in order, say a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cos-d'Estournel</em></span>.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Aller, Fran&ccedil;ois.</em></span> Please bring
some up from the cellar.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Ah, mes amis.</em></span> Come in. Please, sit down.
Fran&ccedil;ois has prepared your usual tables. He will be along
shortly to take your orders when he returns with the wine. We were
listening to a little opera when I realized that a nice bottle of
wine would wonderfully enhance such delightful music.</p><p>Music, like food and cooking, is not a destination but a
lifelong journey. With Linux and a few recipes from open-source
kitchens around the world, everyone can now explore the world of
music from the sheer enjoyment of it to learning and performing.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>, can you not see it? Today, a simple
programmer. Tomorrow, a star upon the world's musical stage. They
say that you must first walk before the running,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? So it is with music. The lessons come
first, a little practice, practice, practice and suddenly you are
at Carnegie Hall, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>To get you started on this road, we must start with the
basics, with some note recognition and ear-training exercises. For
this part of our training, we will use <span   class="bold"><b>GNU
Solfege</b></span>.</p><p>GNU Solfege comes from the Linux kitchen of Tom Cato
Amundsen. This is a wonderful little program designed to help with
&ldquo;ear training.&rdquo; Essentially, ear training is a set of exercises
designed to help young musicians learn and identify musical
intervals, pitch, rhythm and so on. Another part of ear training is
sight-singing (or sight-reading). A student is provided with a
small tune (or chord) written out on a musical staff that they must
then sing. Learning to sight-read a tune can be done alone, but
certain things require an instructor or partner who can play
intervals and chords for you. This is where Solfege comes into
play. By definition, the meaning of the word &ldquo;Solf&eacute;ge&rdquo; is
a set of vocal exercises sung to vowel (a, o, u) or to the classic
syllables, do, re, mi and so on. Solf&eacute;ge requires that a
student learn to identify (and sing) correct notes and
intervals.</p><p>If you follow the SourceForge download link from the Solfege
page, you can get RPM and DEB packages, making installation a
breeze. But of course, the latest source tar ball is available in
gzipped format. Some prerequisites are required for Solfege to
install and work properly. These include
<span   class="bold"><b>Python 1.5.2</b></span>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>GNOME</b></span> libraries (at greater than
or equal to release 1.0.50) and a little something called
<span   class="bold"><b>PyGNOME</b></span> (at greater than or equal
to release 1.0.50). Odds are pretty good that you already have
Python installed on your system. The same may be true for the GNOME
libraries (especially if you run GNOME as your desktop). The
PyGNOME package (aka gnome-python) is often included with later
Linux distros, but that is not a guarantee. On my system, I needed
to install it from its source tar ball (available from the Solfege
web site):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gnome-python-1.0.53.tar.gz&lt;\n&gt;
cd gnome-python-1.0.53
make
make install
</pre><p>Once you have this in place, you are ready to install
Solfege. As I mentioned, the easiest thing to do is pull down
either the RPM or Debian DEB package from SourceForge. If you need
(or want) to do the build yourself, that also is quite simple:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf solfege-0.7-24.tar.gz&lt;\n&gt;
cd solfege-0.7.24
make
make install
</pre>


To run the program, simply type <b  >solfege</b> at the
command prompt (see Figure 1 for Solfege in action).
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4403f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Learning Scales with
Solfege</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, there is a small
possibility that you may encounter some problems here. By default,
Solfege tries to talk to your <b  >/dev/music</b> device.
On my system, the default MIDI device was
<b  >/dev/sequencer</b>, which required that
Fran&ccedil;ois open a 1987 Musigny while I reread the INSTALL
document. Not to worry though, the default device can be changed by
clicking on File followed by Preferences in the Solfege interface.
The next menu has a tab labeled Sound Setup where you can specify
your sound device or an external player such as
<span   class="bold"><b>Timidity</b></span>.</p><p>Ear training is a lifelong process for musicians; even
seasoned professionals may find &ldquo;Solfege&rdquo; useful.</p><p>Those of you who are already musicians, or who aspire to be
so, know the importance of rhythm and keeping time. A good
metronome is one of the musician's essential tools. Alex Roberts
knows this and to that end, has created
<span   class="bold"><b>gtick</b></span>, a small GTK program that
ticks off its beats in 1 (or none), 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4 time. You can
set your timing from 30 to 250 beats per minute.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4403f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The gtick Metronome
</p></div></div><p>You'll have no trouble building and using gtick. Just extract
the source (<b  >tar -xzvf gtick-0.1.3.tar.gz</b>),
<b  >cd</b> to the distribution directory and type
<b  >make</b>. The resulting binary, called gtick, can
then be copied to a place where you keep executables. For instance,
I copied mine into <b  >/usr/local/bin</b> with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp gtick /usr/local/bin
</pre><p>Another candidate for a nice metronome is David Lee Ludwig's
<span   class="bold"><b>gMetronome</b></span>, another GTK program.
This one uses a visual, moving-beat display; eight lights bounce
the beat back and forth from one side to the other. The beat itself
is adjustable from 0 to 250 beats per minute. At this time, this is
strictly a visual metronome rather than an audible one. Perhaps
<span   class="emphasis"><em>notre ami</em></span> David would like to talk to Alex,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4403f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. gMetronome: A Visual Beat
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Like gtick, gMetronome is a breeze to compile and run. After
extracting the source (<b  >tar -xzvf
gMetronome-0.1.0.tar.gz</b>), change directory to the newly
created directory, then type <b  >make</b> followed by
<b  >make install</b>. Type <b  >gmetronome</b>
and you are off.</p><p>In time, inspiration will demand that you capture the tunes
you fashion in your mind so that others may share in your musical
vision. With your Linux system and some great open-source tools,
you can begin to set that vision in a crisp, professional format,
either as distributed MIDI files, or paper scores. For your
convenience, I have already visited many of the Linux notation
kitchens, and I am happy to report that we can surely find
something to tempt your palate.</p><p>Forgive me, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but I must admit
at this time that while he can sing a respectable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>chanson</em></span>, your humble Chef is light years away
from being a musician. Consequently, a simple point-and-click music
notation system was the first thing I looked for. This brought me
to <span   class="bold"><b>NoteEdit</b></span> written by J&ouml;rg
Anders. NoteEdit is a nice-looking application with notes and rests
conveniently placed on a toolbar. With NoteEdit, you can select
different clefs, time and key signatures; choose between a variety
of note values with a mouse click; transpose; and more. When you
are convinced of your masterpiece, you can even export the final
product to a MIDI file or format it for printing using MusixTex.
For a snapshot of NoteEdit in action, have a look at Figure
4.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4403f4.large.jpg"><img src="4403f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Getting Creative with
NoteEdit</p></div></div>
</p><p>NoteEdit is a <span   class="bold"><b>QT</b></span> application
based on the 2.x development libraries from
<span   class="bold"><b>TrollTech</b></span>. If you are running the
new KDE version 2 desktop, you will already have these on your
system. To build NoteEdit, download the latest source and follow
these steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf noteedit-1.9.2.tgz&lt;\n&gt;
cd noteedit-1.9.2
./configure -without-libs
make
</pre><p>Notice that I ran the <b  >configure</b> script
<b  >-without-libs</b>. NoteEdit lets you build three
different varieties of the program. The most powerful build of
NoteEdit makes use of the <span   class="bold"><b>TSE3</b></span>
libraries. Using the libraries gives you the added capabilities of
importing from a MIDI file or attached MIDI keyboard. For tonight's
menu, I will concentrate on the basic recipe only. Adventurous
diners should visit the NoteEdit web site for further details.
</p><p>With our software built, we must first set an environment
variable before we can start the program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export NOTE_EDIT_HOME=/path_to/noteedit_dir&lt;\n&gt;
noteedit
</pre><p>That is all. Get creative. Have fun. Pour yourself a glass of
wine and let yourself go. Use the &ldquo;play&rdquo; button from time to time
to see how you are coming along. You can also save your current
masterpiece whenever you want and get back to it at a later time.
Before I talk to you about printing your work, let me introduce you
to one more music notation package.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rosegarden</b></span>, written by Chris
Cannam, Andy Green, Richard Bown and others, is certainly worth
taking a look at, though somewhat more complex than NoteEdit. As a
notation editor, the package offers multiple staffs, chords,
beaming, triplets, slurs and a notes palette so that you can point
and click your way to fame and fortune. This is also a MIDI
sequencer with piano roll display. Like NoteEdit, you can also
export your creation to MusixTex format for later printing.</p><p>Rosegarden can be compiled and built on Linux and a large
number of other UNIX systems. You can make the installation quite
easy by visiting the site and choosing one of the precompiled
binaries; these are available for many platforms including Linux
ELF. In order to try out Rosegarden, I downloaded the program
source and built it from scratch. Once again, a straightforward
build:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf rosegarden-2.1-sources.tar.gz&lt;\n&gt;
cd rosegarden-2.1
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>After you have built and installed the program, you start
Rosegarden by typing <b  >rosegarden</b>. I used
Rosegarden to import the same <span   class="emphasis"><em>magnum opus</em></span> that
I was working on with NoteEdit (I know it is terrible, but I did
mention that your humble chef does not usually write music). If you
are feeling quite brave, you can see my work in progress in Figure
5.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4403f5.large.jpg"><img src="4403f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Making Music in the
Rosegarden</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now, about printing.</p><p>Both NoteEdit and Rosegarden output their music in
<span   class="bold"><b>MusixTex</b></span> format. MusixTex is
essentially a set of extensions (fonts, programs, etc.) to the
Linux <span   class="bold"><b>TeX</b></span> package, making it
possible to print out high quality music scores. Sadly, there is no
simple &ldquo;Press here to print&rdquo; button on any of these packages so
you will have to dip into the MusixTex waters if you want to
publish your music. It's not all that bad, but exploring this fully
would require an article on its own. The NoteEdit web site has a
nice, quick primer on working with MusixTex, and I would suggest
you start there. The payoff for your hard work will be superb,
high-quality printed music.</p><p>Alas, music notation for Linux is a field that is still
maturing with developers heading off in many different directions.
We have visual notation systems (like NoteEdit and Rosegarden) as
well as text-only language software that converts your typed input
to postscript pages. Some are simple, others much more complex. The
beginner and the professional alike will surely find something to
satisfy their needs. As Fran&ccedil;ois starts to clean up your
plates, allow me to suggest a visit to Dave Phillips' web site
where Dave is the keeper and maintainer of the &ldquo;Sound and Midi
Software for Linux&rdquo; page. This is a great place to start looking
as your musical needs grow.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> It is already late,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? I fear <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
that we must send you all home and close Chez Marcel until next
time. Since you are all within walking distance of your homes, my
faithful waiter Fran&ccedil;ois, will top up your glasses once
again. Fran&ccedil;ois, pour yourself a glass as well. Let us all
sit quietly as we finish up and just listen to Monsieur
Debussy.</p><p>Until next time, your table will be waiting here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>.</p><p>&Agrave; votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="4403s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
