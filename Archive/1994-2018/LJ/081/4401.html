of the simple fact that geeks like games, and partly because of
recent developments in Linux multimedia. Over the past few years a
number of excellent Linux-oriented multimedia toolkits have
emerged, such as the GGI graphics interface and the ALSA sound
system. The SDL library has also made a bit of a splash recently.
SDL is a general-purpose, multimedia-programming library that
provides fast and portable access to graphics, sound, input
devices, threads and OpenGL rendering. The core SDL library is
portable to several flavors of UNIX as well as BeOS, MacOS and
Win32. This makes it an excellent choice for developing
cross-platform games without compromising performance.
</p><p>Unlike many multimedia toolkits, SDL does not actually talk
to the system's hardware. Instead, it serves as a layer between an
application and the underlying system. For instance, SDL's graphics
system might use the frame buffer console or X11 under Linux, but
DirectDraw under Windows. In either case, SDL's API is unchanged,
and the application need not worry about what's going on
underneath, and in some cases a carefully written SDL application
can be ported to a new platform with a quick recompile.</p><p>In this article we'll take a tour of SDL's video API from the
ground up. We'll also demonstrate how to collect input from the
keyboard. Most of this article has been excerpted from a chapter in
the author's upcoming book, on Linux game development (No Starch
Press and Loki Entertainment Software, scheduled for early
2001).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x290d710"></a>Getting SDL</h2></div></div><p>SDL is free software (under the LGPL), and it's available for
download at their web site
(<a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_self">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>).
In addition to the actual SDL library, the SDL home page is full of
example source code, demos, games and extensions. SDL is easy to
install from source, but the SDL home page also provides binaries
for several of the more common platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x290d870"></a>SDL's Design Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>If you've ever worked with Microsoft's DirectX toolkit,
you'll notice that SDL is a tiny library in comparison. The source
code to the core library weighs in at just under six megabytes, and
that includes a lot of extra code that would never be linked into a
Linux application. Don't be fooled, though&mdash;those six megabytes are
well used, and the core SDL library provides almost everything you
need to develop high-quality Linux games and media players. In
addition, the web site is home to a number of add-on libraries that
provide extra features such as image loading and advanced audio
mixing. By keeping these features separate from the core library,
SDL remains small and easy to learn.</p><p>The SDL library consists of several sub-API's, providing
cross-platform support for video, audio, input handling,
multithreading, OpenGL rendering contexts and other things that
game programmers appreciate. Unfortunately, we don't have enough
room to cover all of this, so we'll stick to video programming and
input handling, the two things you really need in order to get your
feet wet with SDL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x290d9d0"></a>The SDL Video API</h2></div></div><p>The SDL video API's sole purpose is to find a suitable video
device and set it up for your application to use. After it has
initialized the display (created a window or switched the video
card into a particular mode) SDL gets out of your way, providing
only a minimal set of functions for pushing blocks of pixels
around. SDL is not a drawing toolkit; what you do with the video
device after it is initialized is not SDL's business.</p><p>SDL uses structures called surfaces (of type
<b  >SDL_Surface</b>) to represent graphical data. A
surface is simply a block of memory for storing a rectangular
region of pixels (individual colored dots). Each surface has a
width, a height and a specific pixel format (more on this later).
SDL loads image files directly into surface structures, and the
screen is also a surface (albeit a special one).</p><p>The most important property of surfaces is that they can be
copied onto each other very quickly; that is, one surface's pixels
can be transferred to an identically-sized rectangular area of
another surface. This operation is called a blit (block image
transfer). Blits are a fundamental part of game programming because
they allow complete images to be composed out of pre-drawn graphics
(often created by artists with image processing software). Since
the screen is a surface like any other, entire images can be sent
to the screen with a single blitting operation. SDL provides a
generic function for performing fast blits between surfaces, and it
can even convert between surfaces of different pixel formats on the
fly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x290dbe0"></a>Setting up the Display</h2></div></div><p>Before we can begin blitting surfaces to the screen, we need
to initialize the SDL library and switch the display into an
appropriate mode. Take a look at Listing 1, the equivalent of
&ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; in SDL.</p><p><a href="4401l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Setting Up the
Display</a></p><p>This program includes the <b  >SDL.h</b> header
file, which is the master header for SDL. Every SDL application
should include this file. The program also includes two standard
headers, for the <b  >printf</b> and
<b  >atexit</b> functions.</p><p>We begin by calling <b  >SDL_Init</b> to initialize
SDL. This function takes an ORed list of arguments to indicate
which subsystems should be initialized; we are only interested in
the video subsystem, so we pass <b  >SDL_INIT_VIDEO</b>
(if we wanted audio, for instance, we would call this function with
<b  >SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO</b>). Unless a fatal
error occurs, this function should return zero. We also use C's
atexit facility to request that <b  >SDL_Quit</b> be
called before the program exits. This function makes sure that SDL
has a chance to shut down properly (which becomes especially
important if a fullscreen application crashes).</p><p>Next, we use the <b  >SDL_SetVideoMode</b> function
to inform the display of our desired resolution (in this case 640
pixels across by 480 pixels down) and color depth (16-bit packed
pixel). There is a catch here: SDL will try to set up the display
as requested, but it might fail. If this happens, SDL won't tell
us, but it will instead emulate the requested mode internally. This
is usually acceptable, since the emulation code is relatively fast,
and we would usually rather not deal with multiple modes
internally. <b  >SDL_SetVideoMode</b> returns a pointer
to the surface that represents the display. If something goes
wrong, this function returns NULL.</p><p>Finally, we report success and exit. The C library calls
<b  >SDL_Quit</b> automatically (since we registered it
with atexit), and SDL returns the video display to its original
mode. (We could also call <b  >SDL_Quit</b> explicitly if
we wanted to shut the system down before exiting our application;
there's no harm in calling it more than once.)</p><p>Now that we've created an SDL application, we need to compile
it. SDL applications are easy to build; assuming a proper
installation of SDL, they just require a few flags and libraries.
The standard SDL distribution includes a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>sdl-config</b></span> (similar to the
<span   class="bold"><b>gtk-config</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>glib-config</b></span> programs that ship
with the GTK+ toolkit) for supplying the appropriate commandline
arguments to gcc. The command <b  >sdl-config
--cflags</b> produces a list of the options that should be
passed to the compiler, and <b  >sdl-config --libs</b>
produces a list of libraries that should be linked in. We can use
backtick substitution to drop this into the gcc command line. If
SDL is installed on your system, you can compile this example with
the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcc sdltest.c -o sdltest `sdl-config --cflags --libs`
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x290e528"></a>Drawing Pixels Directly</h2></div></div><p>Putting data into an SDL surface is simple. Each
<b  >SDL_Surface</b> structure contains a pixels member.
This is a void pointer to the raw graphic image, and we can write
to it directly if we know which type of pixel the surface is set up
for. We must call the <b  >SDL_LockSurface</b> function
before we access this data (because some surfaces reside in special
memory areas and require special handling). When we are finished
with the surface, we must call <b  >SDL_UnlockSurface</b>
to release it. The width and the height of the image are given by
the <b  >w</b> and <b  >h</b> members of the
structure, and the pixel format is specified by the format member
(which is of type <b  >SDL_PixelFormat</b>). SDL often
emulates nonstandard screen resolutions with higher resolutions,
and the pitch member of the pixel format structure indicates the
actual width of the frame buffer. You should always use pitch
instead of w for calculating offsets into the pixels buffer, or
else your application might not work on some display
devices.</p><p>The example shown in Listing 2 will use the SDL pixel format
information to draw individual pixels on the screen. We have chosen
to use a 16-bit (hicolor) mode for demonstration purposes, but
other modes are equally simple to program.</p><p><a href="4401l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Drawing Individual Pixels
on the Screen</a></p><p>The code's comments give the play-by-play, but a few things
might not be obvious. This program employs a very general routine
for constructing hicolor pixel values; this routine will work with
any hicolor (16-bit) pixel format that SDL recognizes. Although we
could write a separate (faster) routine for each possible hicolor
data layout, this would require a lot of work and would only
marginally improve performance. The hicolor 565 (5 red bits, 6
green bits, and 5 blue bits) pixel format is perhaps the most
widely used and could be reasonably optimized, but 556 and 555 are
not uncommon. In addition, there is no guarantee that the bit
fields will be in the red-green-blue order. Our
<b  >CreateHicolorPixel</b> routine solves this problem
by referring to the data in the <b  >SDL_PixelFormat</b>
structure. For instance, the routine uses the
<b  >Rloss</b> member of the structure to determine how
many bits to drop from the 8-bit red component, and it then uses
the <b  >Rshift</b> member to determine where the red
bits should be located within the 16-bit pixel value.</p><p>Another important issue involves the
<b  >SDL_UpdateRect</b> function. As we mentioned
earlier, SDL sometimes emulates video modes if the video card is
unable to provide a certain mode itself. If the video card does not
support a requested 24-bit mode, for instance, SDL might select a
16-bit mode instead and return a fake frame buffer setup for 24-bit
pixels. This would allow your program to continue normally, and SDL
would handle the conversion from 24-bits to 16-bits on the fly
(with a slight performance loss). The
<b  >SDL_UpdateRect</b> function informs SDL that a
portion of the screen has been updated and that it should perform
the appropriate conversions to display that area. If a program does
not use this function, there is a chance that it will still work.
It is better to be on the safe side and call this function whenever
the frame buffer surface has been changed.</p><p>Finally, if you run the program you might notice that it runs
in a window instead of taking over the entire screen. To change
this, replace the zero in the <b  >SDL_SetVideoMode</b>
call with the constant <b  >SDL_FULLSCREEN</b>. Be
careful, though; fullscreen applications are harder to debug, and
they tend to mess things up badly when they crash.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x29055a0"></a>Drawing with Blits</h2></div></div><p>We've seen how to draw pixels directly to a surface, and
there's no reason one couldn't create an entire game with this
alone. However, there is a much better way to draw large amounts of
data to the screen. Our next example will load an entire surface
from a file and draw it with a single SDL surface copying function.
The code can be seen in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4401l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Drawing Large Amounts of
Data to the Screen</a></p><p>As you can see, the bitmap file is loaded into memory with
the <b  >SDL_LoadBMP</b> function. This function returns
a pointer to an <b  >SDL_Surface</b> structure containing
the image, or a <b  >NULL</b> pointer if the image cannot
be loaded. Once this file has been successfully loaded, the bitmap
is represented as an ordinary SDL surface, and a program can draw
it onto the screen or any other surface. Bitmaps use dynamically
allocated memory, and they should be freed when they are no longer
needed. The <b  >SDL_FreeSurface</b> function frees the
memory allocated to a bitmap.</p><p>The <b  >SDL_BlitSurface</b> function performs a
blit of one surface onto another, converting between pixel formats
as necessary. This function takes four arguments: a source surface
(the image to copy from), an <b  >SDL_Rect</b> structure
defining the rectangular region of the source surface to copy, a
destination surface (the image to copy to), and another
<b  >SDL_Rect</b> structure indicating the coordinates on
the destination that the image should be drawn to. These two
rectangles must be of the same width and height (SDL does not
currently perform stretching), but the <b  >x</b> and
<b  >y</b> starting coordinates of the regions may be
different.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x2905b20"></a>Colorkeys and Transparency</h2></div></div><p>Games often need to simulate transparency. For instance,
suppose that we have a bitmap of a game character against a solid
background, and we want to draw the character in a game level. It
would look silly to draw the character as is; the background would
be drawn too, and the character would be surrounded by a block of
solid color. It would be much better to draw only the pixels that
are actually part of the character and not its solid background. We
can do this with a colorkey blit. SDL provides support for this,
and it even provides support for run-length colorkey acceleration
(a nice trick for speeding up drawing). RLE acceleration provides
an enormous performance boost for blitting colorkeyed images, but
this is only practical for bitmaps that will not be modified during
the course of the program (since modifying an RLE image
necessitates unpacking and repacking the image).</p><p>A colorkey is a particular pixel value that a program
declares to be transparent (in SDL, this is done with the
<b  >SDL_SetColorKey</b> function). Pixels that match an
image's colorkey are not copied when the image is blitted. In our
example of a game character, we could set the colorkey to the color
of the solid background, and it would not be drawn. Colorkeys make
it simple to combine rectangular images of non-rectangular
objects.</p><p>In the next example we will use a colorkey blit to draw an
image of Tux against another image [see Listing 4, available at
ftp.linuxjournal.com.pub/lj/listings/issue81/]. Tux is stored against a
solid blue background, and so we will use blue (RGB 0, 0, 255) as
our colorkey. For comparison, we will also draw the same penguin
image without a colorkey.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4401f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x29060a0"></a>Simple Keyboard Handling</h2></div></div><p>SDL assigns a &ldquo;virtual keysym&rdquo; to each key on the keyboard.
These codes (integers) map at some level to the operating system's
keyboard scan codes (which in term map to the codes produced by the
keyboard's hardware), but SDL takes care of the mapping behind the
scenes. SDL provides a preprocessor symbol for each virtual keysym;
for instance, the Escape key corresponds to the symbol
<b  >SDLK_ESCAPE</b>. (You can find a list of valid
keysyms in SDL's documentation.) We use these codes whenever we
need to directly check the state (up or down) of a particular key,
and SDL uses them when it reports key events. Virtual keysyms are
represented by the <b  >SDLKey</b> data type.</p><p>Since we won't be messing with the event interface for now
(indeed, we haven't really even mentioned it), we'll need to ask
the keyboard explicity for its current state whenever we need to
know about a key. A program can obtain a snapshot of the entire
keyboard in the form of an array. The
<b  >SDL_GetKeyState</b> function returns a pointer to
SDL's internal keyboard state array, which is indexed with the
<b  >SDLK_ keysym</b> constants. You only need to call
this function once; the pointer remains valid for the duration of
the program. Each entry in the array is a simple
<b  >Uint8</b> flag indicating whether that key is
currently down. You should call <b  >SDL_PumpEvents</b>
periodically to update the data in the array.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2815580.0x2906410"></a>More, More, More!</h2></div></div><p>That should be enough to get you started with SDL. We've
skipped over a lot, notably animation, alpha blending and audio
playback. If you want to learn more about programming with this
library, the best place to start is the SDL Documentation Project

You might also want to stop by the #sdl channel on
irc.openprojects.net, where you're likely to find a good number of
SDL fans with varying amounts of experience. Have fun, and happy
