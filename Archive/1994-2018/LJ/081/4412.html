Penguin. Don't worry&mdash;the story is a preface to the nuts-and-bolts
sort of stuff you've come to expect in <i  >LJ</i>. In
fact, there are so many nuts and bolts to play with in OpenSSH that
this article spills over into next month's issue!
</p><p>This month we'll cover ssh's background and architecture, how
to build and/or install OpenSSH, how to use ssh as an encrypted
replacement for Telnet, how to set some basic ssh configuration
options and how to use scp for encrypted file transfers. Next month
I'll cover RSA/DSA authentication, local port-forwarding,
remote-command-execution and other more advanced, and extremely
powerful functions of ssh/OpenSSH.</p><p>In order to do this magnificent software justice, I'd like to
begin by talking about how it got here and some of the people who
brought it to us.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2b70768"></a>The Story of SSH</h2></div></div><p>One of the coolest things about UNIX has been that there is
not one but several different ways to administer systems from
remote consoles. Sad to say, most of these methods (Telnet, rsh and
X, to name a few) send everything over the network in clear text,
including passwords. The combination of our reliance on the
Internet with the proliferation of script kiddies and other
packet-sniffing deviants has made administrative clear-text network
applications obsolete.</p><p>But a few years ago Finnish &uuml;ber-hacker Tatu Ylonen
created a mind-blowingly cool thing called the Secure Shell, or
ssh. ssh is a suite of tools that roughly correspond to Sun's rsh,
rcp and rlogin commands, but with one very important difference:
paranoia. ssh lets you do everything rsh, rcp and rlogin do, using
your choice of libertarian-grade encryption and authentication
methods. But wait&mdash;there's a catch&mdash;ssh version 1 relies heavily on
RSA, an excellent, but as we say, encumbered (patented) technology
that requires any application that uses it to be licensed (paid
for) unless it's used in noncommercial settings (even in
noncommercial use ssh's legality has always been murky, especially
in the US). But wait, you say, RSA's US patents expired in
September 2000&mdash;problem solved, right? Almost: Tatu's got to earn a
living, so by the time RSA became less encumbered, ssh itself had
become more so as his company F-Secure tightened the licensing
reins. In fact, beginning with ssh version 2.0, unlicensed/free
commercial use (regardless of RSA issues) was no longer permitted.
All this despite Tatu's sincere desire that ssh become an Internet
standard, one of the requirements of which is that at least one
free implementation be available.</p><p>Enter Theo de Raadt and the OpenBSD team. OpenBSD, of course,
is the ultra-secure offshoot of NetBSD, a free version of BSD UNIX.
Theo and our open-source brethren in the OpenBSD project wanted to
include ssh in OpenBSD 2.6 but were wary of ssh's various
encumbrances. When they learned that the Swedish programmer Bjoern
Groenvall had released an improved version of ssh, 1.2.12 (the last
completely free-except-for-RSA version of Ylonen's ssh), the
OpenBSD guys rapidly got to work on updating and adapting it for a
larger audience. OpenSSH has been part of OpenBSD ever since and is
now portable to most version of UNIX.</p><p>OpenSSH built on Groenvall's work (his version, called OSSH,
is still available), adding support for later versions of the ssh
protocol and modularizing its cryptographic mechanisms in such a
way that it's possible to compile OpenSSH without any patented
algorithms whatsoever (i.e., without support for ssh v.1 protocols,
which depend on RSA). The other innovation the OpenBSD team brought
is the forking of the OpenSSH code-base into a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; version,
which is kept as simple and platform-independent as possible, and a
&ldquo;portable&rdquo; version, which can be compiled for a variety of
versions of UNIX besides OpenBSD.</p><p>This last innovation is of particular note to us Linux geeks:
the clean version is kept that way to maximize the code's
&ldquo;auditability&rdquo;, ensuring that it's fundamentally stable and
secure. Only after this code is blessed by Theo (a righteous
paranoiac) are portability enhancements added. Thus, we benefit
from a software package that is both extremely secure and 100%
Linux-compatible.</p><p>By the way, less than two months passed between the time the
OpenBSD crew discovered OSSH and the time they released OpenSSH
1.2.2; and only six and a half months after that they released the
fully-portable and ssh v.2-compatible OpenSSH 2.0. Even considering
that they were building on Ylonen's and Groenvall's work, this is a
remarkable achievement, especially considering the quality of the
end product and the fact that nobody gets paid for it!</p><p>So that's the story of ssh and OpenSSH so far. I hope you
agree that it's a pretty compelling one, as notable as OpenSSH
itself, which in all likelihood will very rapidly become the
preferred version of ssh for open-source versions of UNIX.</p><p>Are you all fired up about OpenSSH and ready to install it on
every UNIX system you control? Good. Let's get busy!</p><p>By the way: &ldquo;ssh v.1.x&rdquo; and &ldquo;ssh protocol v.1&rdquo; refer to
ssh's software-release and protocol, respectively, and are not
really synonymous. But since the package and protocol major version
numbers <span   class="emphasis"><em>roughly</em></span> correspond, from here on in
I'll use &ldquo;ssh v.1x&rdquo; to refer to RSA-based versions of ssh/OpenSSH
and &ldquo;ssh v.2x&rdquo; to refer to versions that support both RSA and
DSA. And if you don't know the difference between RSA and DSA,
suffice it to say that both do the same thing but DSA has no
patent- or license-restrictions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2b70b88"></a>How SSH Works</h2></div></div><p>Secure Shell works very similarly to Secure Sockets Layer web
transactions (it's no coincidence that the cryptographical
functions used by OpenSSH are provided by OpenSSL, a free version
of Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer source-code libraries). Both can
set up encrypted channels using generic &ldquo;host keys&rdquo; or with
published credentials (digital certificates) that can be verified
by a trusted certificate authority (such as VeriSign). Here's how
connections are built.</p><p>First, the client and the server exchange (public) host keys.
If the client machine has never encountered a given public key
before, both ssh and most web browsers ask the user whether to
accept the untrusted key. Next, they use these to negotiate a
session key that is used to encrypt all subsequent session data via
a block cipher such as Triple-DES (3DES), blowfish, or idea.</p><p>Then, the server attempts to authenticate the client using
RSA or DSA certificates. If this isn't possible, the client is
prompted for a standard username/password combination (optionally,
&ldquo;rhosts&rdquo; host-IP-based authentication with or without RSA keys
may be used; OpenSSH also supports KerberosIV and skey). Finally,
after successful authentication the session proper begins: either a
remote shell, a secure file transfer, a remote command, etc., is
begun over the encrypted tunnel.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, ssh is actually a suite of
tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>sshd&mdash;d&aelig;mon that acts as a server to all
other commands</p></li><li><p>ssh&mdash;primary end-user tool: remote shell, remote
command, and port-forwarding sessions</p></li><li><p>scp&mdash;tool for automated file transfers</p></li><li><p>sftp&mdash;tool for interactive file
transfers&mdash;COMMERCIAL SSH ONLY</p></li><li><p>ssh-keygen&mdash;generates private-public key pairs for
use in RSA and DSA authentication (including host keys)</p></li><li><p>ssh-agent&mdash;d&aelig;mon used to automate client's
RSA/DSA authentications</p></li><li><p>ssh-add&mdash;loads private keys into ssh-agent
process</p></li><li><p>ssh-askpass&mdash;X interface for ssh-add</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that sftp, which is essentially an ftp client with
encryption and strong authentication grafted on, is available only
in F-Secure's commercial versions of ssh version 2&mdash;I only mention
it here because you may come across a reference to it elsewhere and
wonder why you've only got scp.
</p><p>Of these tools, most users concern themselves only with ssh,
since &ldquo;encrypted Telnet&rdquo; is the simplest use of ssh. Scp,
ssh-agent and ssh-add, however, along with the strong
authentication and TCP port-forwarding capabilities of ssh itself,
make ssh considerably more flexible than that. Since we're paranoid
and want to encrypt as much of the stuff we fling over the networks
as possible, we really groove on this flexibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2b71420"></a>Getting and Installing OpenSSH</h2></div></div><p>The OpenSSH web site (see Resources) is the place to go for
the latest version of OpenSSH, both in source-code and RPM forms,
and also for OpenSSL, which is required by OpenSSH. Also required
is zlib, available at the freesoftware.com site (see
Resources).</p><p>Note that you may not be able to get by with RPM packages.
When I tried to install the RPMs from OpenSSH.com on my laptop,
running SuSE Linux, everything worked except sshd, which wouldn't
install due to SuSE's lack of a &ldquo;chkconfig&rdquo; package. Your
preferred flavor of Linux may or may not have the same problem
(unless it has chckconfig), or it may have its own RPM of OpenSSH
(for all I know, by the time you read this somebody may have
published RPMs for SuSE).</p><p>If RPMs won't work, you'll need to build OpenSSH (and
possibly OpenSSL and zlib) from source. To Linux old-timers,
&ldquo;rolling your own&rdquo; software installations is old hat, but if
you're not in that category don't despair. All three distributions
use &ldquo;.configure&rdquo; scripts that eliminate the need for most users
to edit any Makefiles. Assuming your system has gcc and the normal
assortment of system libraries and that these are reasonably
up-to-date, the build process is both fast and simple.</p><p>In my own case, after installing OpenSSL 0.9.5a and
zlib-1.1.3 (all version numbers, by the way, may be outdated by the
time you read this!) I followed these steps to build and install
OpenSSH 2.1.1p4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf openssh-2.1.1p4.tar.gz
cd openssh-2.1.1p4
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh
make
make install
</pre><p>Per instructions provided by the file &ldquo;INSTALL&rdquo; I fed the
configure script one customized option: rather than installing all
configuration-files in <b  >/etc</b>, I instructed it to
create and use a subdirectory, <b  >/etc/sshd</b>. Since
this version of OpenSSH supports both RSA and DSA keys, it makes
sense to minimize the amount of clutter ssh adds to
<b  >/etc</b>.
</p><p>For a client-only installation, this is all you need to do.
Note that one or more of the version numbers cited above may
already be dated by the time you read this article; be sure to
check the OpenSSH and zlib web sites for the latest
versions.</p><p>If you wish to run the Secure Shell D&aelig;mon sshd (i.e.,
you wish to accept ssh connections from remote hosts), you'll also
need to create startup scripts and, in the case of SuSE, edit
<b  >/etc/rc.config</b>. This has also been thought of
for you: the source distribution's &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; directory contains
some useful goodies.</p><p>The Red Hat directory contains &ldquo;sshd.init&rdquo;, which can be
copied to <b  >/etc/rc.d</b> and linked to in the
appropriate runlevel directory (<b  >/etc/rc.d/rc2.d</b>,
etc.). It also contains &ldquo;sshd.pam&rdquo;, which can be installed in
<b  >/etc/pam</b> if you use Pluggable Authentication
Modules (PAM) and &ldquo;openssh.spec&rdquo;, which can be used to create
your very own OpenSSH RPM package. These files are, obviously,
intended for use on Red Hat systems but will probably also work on
Red Hat-derived systems (Mandrake, Yellow Dog, etc.).</p><p>The suse directory also contains an &ldquo;openssh.spec&rdquo; file for
creating OpenSSH prpm packages for SuSE and an &ldquo;rc.sshd&rdquo; file to
install in <b  >/etc/rc.d</b> (actually
<b  >/sbin/init.d</b> in SuSE). In addition, it contains
&ldquo;rc.config.ssd&rdquo;, the contents of which must be added to
<b  >/etc/rc.config</b> in order for the rc.sshd script
to work properly. This is achieved by simply entering the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat ./rc.config.ssd &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.config
</pre><p>Create a symbolic link in rc2.d and/or rc3.d, and your SuSE
system is ready to serve up secured shells! Either reboot or type
<b  >/etc/rc.d/rc.sshd start</b> to start the
d&aelig;mon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2b71cb8"></a>SSH for the Masses: Doing the &ldquo;Encrypted
Telnet&rdquo; Thing</h2></div></div><p>What if all you need are interactive shell sessions on remote
systems <span   class="emphasis"><em>&agrave; la</em></span> Telnet? Chances are that
even without so much as looking at a configuration file, you need
to simply enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh remote.host.net
</pre><p>You will be prompted for a password (ssh will assume you wish
to use the same user name on the remote system as the one you're
currently logged in with locally), and if that succeeds, you're in!
That's arguably simpler and indisputably much more secure than
Telnet.
</p><p>If you need to use a different user name on the remote system
than the one you're logged in with locally, you need to add the
flag <b  >-l</b> followed by your remote username. For
example, if I'm logged on to my laptop as &ldquo;mick&rdquo; and wish to ssh
to kong-fu.mutantmonkeys.org as user &ldquo;mbauer&rdquo;, I'll use the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -l mbauer kong-fu.mutantmonkeys.org
</pre><p>What is this doing for me? Nothing seems much different from
Telnet. I may be asked whether to accept the remote server's public
key, it may take somewhat longer for the session to get started and
depending on network conditions, server load, etc., the session may
seem slightly slower than Telnet, but for the most part I won't
notice much difference.
</p><p>But I will have logged in without sending my username and
password over the network in clear text, and all session data will
be encrypted as well. I can do whatever I need to do, including
<b  >su -</b>, without worrying about eavesdroppers. And
all it costs me is a tiny bit of latency!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2f6a328"></a>Digging into Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>Configuring OpenSSH isn't complicated either. To control the
behavior of the ssh client and server there are only two files to
edit: <b  >ssh_config</b> and
<b  >sshd_config</b>. Depending on the package you
installed or the build you created, these files are either in
<b  >/etc</b> or some other place you specified using
<b  >.configure</b>'s <b  >-sysconfdir</b>
directory.</p><p>ssh_config is a global configuration file for ssh client
sessions initiated from the local host. Its settings are overridden
by command-line options and by users' individual configuration
files (kept, if they exist, in
<b  >$HOME/.ssh/config</b>). For example, if
<b  >/etc/ssh/ssh_config</b> contains the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Compression no
</pre><p>but the file <b  >/home/bobo/.ssh/config</b>
contains the line
<pre     class="programlisting">
Compression yes
</pre>


then whenever the user &ldquo;bobo&rdquo; initiates a ssh session,
compression will be enabled by default, even though for users
without this setting in their own
<b  >$HOME/.ssh/config</b> files compression will be
turned off. If, on the other hand, bobo invokes ssh with the
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -o Compression=no remote.host.net
</pre>


then compression will not be enabled for that session.
</p><p>In other words, the order of precedence for ssh options is,
in decreasing order, the ssh command-line invocation,
<b  >$HOME/.ssh/config</b>, and
<b  >/etc/ssh/ssh_config</b>.</p><p>ssh_config consists of a list of parameters, one line per
parameter, in the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
parameter value(s)
</pre><p>Some parameters are Boolean and can have a value of either
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Others can have a list of values separated by
commas. Most parameters are self-explanatory, and all are explained
in the ssh(1) man page. Table 1 shows a few of the most useful
and/or important ones (italicized text indicates possible values).
</p><p><a href="4412t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Some Basic Client Options
for ssh_config</a></p><p>There are many other options in addition to these; some of
them will be covered in Part II of this article. Refer to the ssh
man page for a complete list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2f6ac18"></a>Configuring and Running sshd, the Secure Shell
D&aelig;mon</h2></div></div><p>All of that's fine if the hosts you connect to are
administered by other people. But we haven't yet talked about
configuring your own host to accept ssh connections. As it happens,
this is very simple.</p><p>As with the ssh client, sshd's default behavior is configured
in a single file, &ldquo;sshd_config&rdquo; that resides either in
<b  >/etc</b> or wherever else you specified the ssh's
configuration directory. And as with the ssh client, settings in
its configuration file are overridden by command-line arguments.
Unlike the ssh client, however, there are no configuration files
for the d&aelig;mon in individual users' home directories; ordinary
users can't dictate how the d&aelig;mon behaves.</p><p>Table 2 describes a few of the things that can be set in
sshd_config.</p><p><a href="4412t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Setting Parameters in
sshd_config</a></p><p>There are many other parameters that can be set in
sshd_config. We'll cover some of those next month, but
understanding the above is enough to get started (assuming your
immediate need is to replace Telnet and ftp).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a78580.0x2f6af30"></a>Using scp for Encrypted File Transfers</h2></div></div><p>We'll cover one more ssh topic before we adjourn for this
month. The scp command, in most ways equivalent to the old
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> utility, is used to copy a
file or directory from one host to another. (In fact, scp is based
on rcp's source code.) In case you're unfamiliar with either,
they're noninteractive: each is invoked with a single command line,
in which you must specify the names and paths of both of what
you're copying and where you want it to go.</p><p>This noninteractive quality makes scp a bit less
user-friendly than ftp: like it or not, to use scp you need to read
its man page (or articles like this) and memorize a few flags. But
like most other command-line utilities, scp is far more useful in
scripts than interactive tools tend to be. Using scp &ldquo;on the
fly&rdquo;, though, is easy to learn. The basic syntax of the scp
command is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scp [ options ] sourcefilestring destfilestring
</pre><p>where the source and destination file strings can either be a
normal UNIX file/path string (e.g., <b  >"./docs/hello.txt",
"/home/me/mydoc.txt",</b> etc.) or a host-specific string in
the format
<pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>@<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote.host.name</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>path/filename</em></span>
</pre>


For example, suppose you're logged into the host &ldquo;crueller&rdquo; and
want to transfer the file &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to your home directory on the
remote host &ldquo;kolach&rdquo;. Suppose further that you've got the same
user name on both systems. The session would look something like
this (user input in bold):
<pre     class="programlisting">
crueller: &gt; scp ./recipe kolach:~
mick@kolach's password: *******
recipe         100% |**************&gt;| 13226    00:00
crueller: &gt;
</pre>


After typing the scp command line, we were prompted for our
password (our username, since we didn't specify one, was
automatically submitted for us using the username we're logged on
to crueller as). scp then copied the file over, showing us a handy
progress bar as it went along. And that's it!
</p><p>Suppose you're logged on to crueller as &ldquo;mick&rdquo; but have the
username &ldquo;mbauer&rdquo; on kolach and wish to write the file to
kolach's directory <b  >data/recipes/pastries.</b> Then
our command line would look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crueller: &gt; scp ./recipe mbauer@kolach:/data/recipies/pastries/
</pre><p>Now let's switch things around. Suppose we want to retrieve
the file <b  >/etc/oven.conf</b> from kolach (we're still
logged in to crueller). Then our command line looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
crueller: &gt; scp mbauer@kolach:/etc/oven.conf.
</pre>


Get the picture? The important thing to remember is that the source
must come before the destination.
</p><p>Although most users use ssh and scp for simple logins and
file transfers, respectively, this only scratches the surface of
what ssh can do. Next month we'll examine how RSA and DSA keys can
be used to make ssh transactions even more secure, how
&ldquo;null-passphrase&rdquo; keys can allow ssh commands to be included in
scripts, how to cache ssh credentials in RAM to avoid unnecessary
authentication prompts and how to tunnel other TCP services through
an encrypted ssh connection.</p><p><a href="4412s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
