read anything in <i  >LJ</i> that interested me.
Business, web programming and networking take up the bulk of your
publication, and I'm sure these things are of interest to many, but
not to me. Furthermore, many of the software/book reviews are
amateurish and almost all of them lack depth. For example, a review
of a math program that actually gave an example of how to do
something <span   class="emphasis"><em>nontrivial</em></span>, as opposed to &ldquo;this
program knows how to multiply matrices, isn't that neat&rdquo; would be
welcome. Useful tips for the garden-variety UNIX user would be
nice, but that's already covered quite well by <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span>. I also wouldn't mind seeing a well-written
article that provided some hard criticism of the shortcomings of
various Linux distributions and pulled no punches, but of course
you don't want to offend your advertisers.</p><p>&mdash;Tom Goldring</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d95580.0x1e8d348"></a>Backup Recovery Revisited</h2></div></div><p>I am an incarcerated subscriber. Until my recent transfer to
a pre-release center I worked with computers for ten years in
various industries within the Texas prison system. I have worked
with Linux off and on over the past five years. Our computers have
tended to be older machines handed down after their primary users
deemed them obsolete. Thus, they are more prone to hardware
failures. I have learned the hard way that backups are essential. I
have come to appreciate a backup and restoration process that is as
simple as possible&mdash;Keep It Short and Simple (KISS).</p><p>I read with interest Charles Curley's article &ldquo;Bare Metal
Recovery&rdquo; (November 2000). And, I have to credit him with devising
a sophisticated method of backing up and restoring a system. Good
work! However, his method is too sophisticated, and I balk at the
thought of having to repeat such a complex process for each machine
that I need to back up. The problem is that the restoration disk
contains the backup of the base system (&ldquo;metadata&rdquo;, as Mr. Curley
calls it) and, therefore, a restoration disk must be built for each
and every system. (Not to mention the need to resave the base
system to the restoration disk every time the configuration is
changed.) The restoration disk should only contain a minimal system
with the appropriate drivers and utilities and the restoration
software. The backup of the base system itself should be contained
on the normal backup media. This way a single restoration disk can
be used on any number of machines.</p><p>If you are using a backup utility that is too large to fit on
a floppy, then building a restoration disk on a Zip drive (or Jaz
drive or spare IDE hard drive) is appropriate. However, I noticed
that the venerable tar utility won the Favorite Backup Utility
category in your &ldquo;2000 Readers' Choice Awards&rdquo; (November 2000).
Hurrah! tar is my favorite, too. Why? Because with very little
effort I can restore a Linux system (or an entire department of
Linux boxes) from a single set of boot and root floppy disks. You
can build your own floppy-based system (re: &ldquo;Customize Linux from
the Bottom&mdash;Building Your Own Linux Base System&rdquo;, November 2000)
or you can use any of the many miniature distributions. I prefer to
use Slackware's boot and root disks (I may be a little out of date
here, not having used their newer disks since version 4.0.). Their
&ldquo;scsinet&rdquo; boot disk contains common SCSI and NIC drivers. If you
need a driver that is absent, you can build a custom kernel from
the source (same version, of course) and write it to the boot disk.
Their &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; root disk contains tar, file system and network
utilities. You may need to create a device node for your particular
backup device. I appreciate the convenience of Slackware's boot and
root disks. I have never had a need for anything else, and I have
had many occasions to restore a downed system or migrate a system
to another machine. tar is definitely the backup/restoration tool
du jour and a floppy-based system is the easiest means of restoring
one or many systems. KISS!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&mdash;Antonio Barta</p><p>I read your October 2000 &ldquo;Comparison of Backup Products&rdquo; by
Charles Curley with great interest. The article was very
surprising, especially since our product (Microlite BackupEDGE) was
not included in the test.</p><p>I say surprising because we've been in the Intel UNIX/Linux
backup marketplace since 1987. Also, we were the first commercial
vendor to introduce a disaster recovery component for Linux
products, back in April of 1999 at Comdex Spring.</p><p>In short, how did you miss us?</p><p>&mdash;D. Thomas Podnar, President Microlite
Corporationtom@microlite.com</p><p>The only reason I did not mention your product was simply
because I needed to limit the review in size and scope to keep it
down to a manageable size. As you know, there are a lot of good
products on the market, and plenty of gnuware and freeware products
as well. Had I taken the time to cover all of them, I'd still be at
it, and would take up an entire issue of the magazine if I ever got
it done. I do hope that my comments on the products I reviewed were
sufficiently general that the reader can learn something about
evaluating backup software in general.</p><p>&mdash;Charles Curley</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d95580.0x1e8d7c0"></a>Victor Yodaiken on Real-Time Linux</h2></div></div><p>Re your &ldquo;Real Hard Time&rdquo; article in the November issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>: your readers should know that
both TimeSys and Lineo use real-time technology taken from FSMLabs
RTLinux. What those companies add (other than a fascinating
interpretation of the GPL) is a misunderstanding of what makes
RTLinux useful. RTLinux adds a special multithreaded, real-time
process to Linux and rigorously prevents Linux from delaying the
operation of this process. The real-time process schedule, itself,
ignores Linux synchronization, and has access to the raw hardware.
Instead of adding &ldquo;features&rdquo; to the real-time process, we
encourage developers to break out of the box and take advantage of
a dual environment: hard real-time with a stripped down POSIX
threads API in this special process, and the stability and power of
Linux outside of the special process. The pedal-to-the-metal
performance and reliability of RTLinux are possible because our
design allows us to toss away many &ldquo;features&rdquo; that have been
considered essential in previous real-time operating
systems.</p><p>In my ever so humble opinion, some of the new arrivals to
Linux and RTLinux operate under the mistaken theory that simplicity
is a &ldquo;lack of maturity&rdquo; in the technology. But simplicity in both
Linux and in RTLinux is a deliberate design choice and is the
hard-won and hard-to-keep &ldquo;feature&rdquo; that we most prize. In horror
movies, the victims have to walk down the steps into the dark
basement to see exactly what is making that growling noise. Don't
they know that IRIX and RT-Mach and who knows how many other
victims have preceded them down the stairs&mdash;and none of them ever
came back?</p><p>&mdash;Victor Yodaikenyodaiken@fsmlabs.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Look for Victor and Edgar Hilton's article on

issue was vast and varied. Below are a few samplings from each side
along with the advertiser's response.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p><p>I think the picture of a naked programmer on the supplement
was a bit much, but still laughable. However, in the November 2000
<i  >LJ</i>, page 43 contains an ad by Qsol.com that
contains what some would call vulgar insinuation.</p><p>Personally, I think this type of sexism has now gone too far
in your magazine and sullies the character, professionalism and
image of <i  >LJ</i>, not to mention some of the people
who buy it. I ask you to please contain the college crowd a bit
more, and give us a magazine we can proudly display on our living
room coffee tables or at work without having to rip pages
out.</p><p>I for one will never use Qsol.com's products as I don't agree
with their advertising message.</p><p>&mdash;Gordon Cunninghamgcunnin2@bellsouth.net</p><p>Not that I want to be accused of being politically correct of
anything, but I bought my copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, November 2000, and found the advertisement
opposite page 42 a *leeetle* beyond the pale. I mean, [that
caption]--with that picture! I had a flashback to advertisements
from the 1970s.</p><p>God knows we have few enough women in this industry (and in
Open Source specifically) as it is, and adverts like this aren't
going to help us any.</p><p>Not that I want to stop a corporate citizen's rights to
&ldquo;individual speech&rdquo; or anything, but maybe someone might hit them
with a clue stick?</p><p>&mdash;Jeremy Allisonjeremy@valinux.com</p><p>As the proud owner of 150 copies of the Python supplement, I
read with rapt attention the many letters regarding its famous
nudie cover. This has all left me <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> curious
as to what kind of response you will get for the QSol ad on page 43
of the November 2000 issue. I hope you will print a sampling. It's
very interesting from a marketing perspective. I'm fairly sure you
wouldn't see this stuff in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>InfoWeek</em></span>, and the fact that you do see it in
<i  >LJ</i> tells me something about the markets Linux
is and isn't in.</p><p>Not that I ever want to see you turn into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span>. It's just that I've worked in Corporate
America and I can see where the negative response comes from. The
part of me that tries to sell Linux/Python solutions to this often
ultra conservative group feels that a print leader of the Linux
community such as <i  >LJ</i> needs to walk a more
conservative line.</p><p>But, thankfully, the rest of me says to heck with it. Let
someone else do <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> for Linux. I hope that
whatever you do, you continue to print articles with so much
delicious geeky detail and technically focused variety.</p><p>&mdash;Stephansdeibel@archaeopteryx.com</p><p>I would like to commend you on having the guts to print what
is probably one of the most creative ads I have seen in a long
while. The ad on page 43 of the November 2000 issue. A lesser
magazine (especially one that that just had problems with a cover
shot that included a naked man&mdash;another awesome show of backbone on
<i  >LJ</i>'s part) probably would have refused it. I
know you will probably take a lot of heat for it but, I am
impressed. I thought the add was a riot. My only problem is whether
to tear it out and pin it up in my cube or keep the article
together in the magazine. All things being equal I would much
rather deal with a company with a sense of humor than one that
refused a funny ad for fear of offending someone. In fact, all
things not being equal I would rather deal with a company with this
type of add. Please keep up the GREAT work and don't back down from
the people that will always complain.</p><p>&mdash;James Alspachjalspach@csione.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>We sincerely apologize to all those who have
