    And the winners are....
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4391_edchoice.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c863a0"></a></h2></div></div><p> As reported in the 1999 Editors' Choice
Awards, it's been another year of bursting developments and
blossoming advancements for our favorite operating system. Not only
is Linux becoming the hot OS of embedded environments, but the
first year of the new millennium has witnessed the expiration of
the RSA patent, allowing open-source security tools to be included
in Linux distributions. The SourceForge site, furnished by VA Linux
has quickly become perhaps the most valuable resource for
programming tools and information. More attention than ever is
being paid to the penguin OS as a desktop alternative by large
corporations and venture capitalists who are finally beginning to
understand the free business model and are, happily, coming to
accept the GNU GPL instead of coming up with their own incompatible
licenses. Additionally, an increasing amount of previously
proprietary software is becoming open source, such as Sun's
StarOffice, now free under the GNU GPL. All this translates to an
ever-enlarging field of competitors for the Editors' Choice Awards.
And not only are there more entries than ever, but almost all
entries are increasing in quality and functionality, making the
choice of our favorites akin to deciding on a drink at an open bar
with a one-drink limit. Sure you can have that Tom Collins, but
only at the expense of the White Russian. If some of our choices
rub you wrong, make it a stiff one and be reconciled.

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4391f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>We know, we know, we should have picked the rackmount version
of this easy-to-configure server. The &ldquo;RaQ&rdquo; is the one that
people have been buying by the truckload. But we like the cube
shape. It's so...cubical. The whole thing just works, even for
people who aren't Linux experts. It was the happy, new users who
clinched our decision in favor of this box. Read the QubeQuorner
weblog if you want to see some of the stuff that the user community
(Quommunity?) is up to.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86710"></a>+Web Server: VA Linux Systems 2200 series with
Debian</h2></div></div><p>VA Linux Systems has a good reputation for getting good
hardware and installing Linux on it. Last year, they got ambitious,
designed their own easy-open 2U chassis, and filled it with
hot-swap RAID drives and other quality parts. This year, the puzzle
is complete, as they put Debian on the latest 2200 series servers.
Now you can upgrade your software as easily as you swap a
drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86818"></a>+Enterprise Application Server: IBM eServer
zSeries</h2></div></div><p>Everybody has been jumping up and down at how clueful IBM has
become in the Linux department. But why change the name of the
System/390? That's like renaming the battleship
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Iowa.</em></span> But silly name or not, you have to love
a server that lets you start up a whole new instance of Linux for a
project without even going down to the server room to run another
Ethernet cable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86978"></a>+Office Workstation: ASL Merlin 60</h2></div></div><p>Except for a loud fan in the preproduction system we tested,
we like this box a lot. It's put together well from top-quality
components and supported by a small, friendly company. The CPU is
AMD's Duron, the cheap version of the celebrated Athlon, and we
like the well-supported Matrox video card and the reliable IBM hard
drive too. Just the thing for running the new, free StarOffice, or
designing your new web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86a80"></a>+Technical Workstation: Elinux.com</h2></div></div><p>Frankly, nobody has yet shown us a high-end Linux workstation
that has really knocked our socks off. The Linux workstation
industry is still in its infancy, and good 3-D support still
requires some tweaking and RTFM-ing. So, socks still firmly on our
feet, we visited elinux.com, browsed their selection of
Linux-compatible parts and built our own workstation. Maybe next
year there will be a workstation that impresses us right out of the
box, but we'll still like elinux.com for important stuff like SCSI
cards and name-brand RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86b88"></a>+Web Client: the Internet Junkbuster
Proxy</h2></div></div><p>Early this year, we heard quite a bit about privacy abuses by
the web advertising agency Doubleclick. So rather than getting
&ldquo;pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered&rdquo;
by their global-tracking database, we've installed privacy
protection software: the Internet Junkbuster Proxy.</p><p>If you travel with your laptop, put a copy on it too. Not
downloading banners can make hotel dial-up speeds tolerable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86ce8"></a>+Graphics Application:(tie) gif2png,
pngcrush</h2></div></div><p>Neither of our two choices for best graphics application even
has a GUI interface. Sometimes you need to script something, and
converting any unlicensed GIFs you may have lying around to the
legal PNG format is one of those times.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gif2png</b></span> includes a script to
grovel through your entire site and expunge the GIFs once and for
all. And, some software creates oversized PNGs when you &ldquo;save as
PNG&rdquo;, and <span   class="bold"><b>pngcrush</b></span> can go back
and do it right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86ef8"></a>+Backup Utility: Amanda</h2></div></div><p>There is a large selection of backup tools for Linux, and
we're glad, because it makes it easier to back up your new Linux
box where the Powers that Be have already chosen the backup
software to be used.</p><p>At <i  >Linux Journal</i> though, we run Amanda.
We can get whatever software we want at no charge because software
companies give us copies to butter us up. But our sysadmin team
chose Amanda, which stands for &ldquo;Advanced Maryland Automatic
Network Disk Archiver&rdquo;. There's an unrelated project called Amanda
at Berkeley, so be sure not to install the wrong software&mdash;the
Berkeley Amanda is the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array,
and you don't want to find yourself with a bunch of muon-tracking
data instead of backups of your files.</p><p>Amanda is classic, old-school free software&mdash;infinitely
configurable, not fancy, but reliable. It takes a while to learn
and set up, but once you've got it configured the way you want, it
should be trouble-free.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c87108"></a>+Communication Tool: Jabber</h2></div></div><p>In an earlier article we wrote, &ldquo;Jabber is built so wide
open that it's hard to see the limits of what can be done with
it.&rdquo; And we like the &ldquo;explosive combination&rdquo; of XML and instant
messaging. With Jabber, any two identities, whether human or
machine, can send and receive real-time messages that contain
pretty much anything and can do so in a structured way,
independent, if necessary, of intermediating protocols. Jabber is
going to be the basis of some fun applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c87210"></a>+3-D Application: Blender</h2></div></div><p>Think of Blender as the planter for the render farm&mdash;it's the
application that lets you design 3-D scenes. But fire it up and
you'll quickly realize that Blender is no Xpaint. This is some
heavy software and takes a real-time investment to learn. But we
judge a tree by its fruits, and digital art produced with Blender
is pretty impressive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c87318"></a>+Database: PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>Tim Perdue, a well-known PHP wizard, explained the benefits
of using PostgreSQL as a back-end database for his web projects:
&ldquo;To start, we will make use of Postgres' SELECT...FOR UPDATE
syntax, which effectively locks selected rows so you can update
them and commit your changes within a transaction.&rdquo;</p><p>And, he adds, &ldquo;With some databases, like MySQL, you can't
easily lock specific rows of data to prevent other processes from
decrementing the inventory while you are also trying to decrement
the inventory. What you wind up with is inaccurate numbers and a
useless inventory count.&rdquo; Now, we can't have that. If your
e-commerce site sells the last Furby twice, you're in big
trouble.</p><p>For &ldquo;big-database&rdquo; features and the configurability and
administration advantages of open source, we give PostgreSQL a big
thumbs-up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c874d0"></a>+Game: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of
Fortune</em></span></h2></div></div><p>If you invest your time and money in a computer game, you
want to see people suffer when you shoot them, right? Anatomically
correct gunshot wounds. Screams of agony. Simplistic plot. Put it
all together and what do you get? Hours of fun, that's what.</p><p>Weak stomach? Try GNOME <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freecell</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c876e0"></a>+Development Tool: Python</h2></div></div><p>Hell is other people's Perl. Enough said.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c877e8"></a>Office Application/Suite: StarOffice</h2></div></div><p>We must confess something right now. Here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we're just not big office suite users. We
basically get by with vi until we send articles to layout, and when
someone sends us a proprietary-format document, we just trash it
and add them to the bozo list. But every once in a while, in our
personal lives, we have to do up a batch of anti-DMCA flyers or
something. For that, there's StarOffice. A bit on the hoggish side,
but it gets the job done. And we'll buy beers for Sun people at the
next Linux show&mdash;thank you for putting the new version under the
GPL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c87948"></a>+Desktop Environment: KDE</h2></div></div><p>Remember how Matt Suhey didn't rap on the &ldquo;Super Bowl
Shuffle&rdquo; but he gained a bunch of yardage, including a touchdown,
in Super Bowl XX? KDE is the Matt Suhey of the Linux desktop.
Despite the attention paid to a certain other desktop project this
year, we're most impressed with the stability and just plain
well-thought-outitude of KDE. KWord is a promising word processor,
and all the desktop doodads work well too. Most of us at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> run KDE.</p><p>Troll Tech ended up fixing the KDE licensing mess with the
stroke of a pen, but the next licensing controversy could go the
other way, if the company involved turns out to be less cool than
Troll Tech. So, kids don't try the license incompatibility thing at
home.</p><p>By the way, that's Super Bowl 0x14 for those of you who
aren't NFL fans.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c87b58"></a>+Mobile Devices: Tuxtops</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4391f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Tuxtops is in a strange position, halfway between being a
hardware vendor like VA Linux Systems and being a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Consumer Reports</em></span> for Linux laptops. They're
too small to influence manufacturers' hardware selections, so they
have to take the best laptop they can get and put customized
software on it. But Tuxtops is a refreshing burst of honesty in a
shrink-wrapped world.</p><p>We like their &ldquo;Coming Clean&rdquo; pages, in which they list the
inadequacies in the hardware they ship. One page points out that
one system's Lucent modem is &ldquo;cranky and temperamental&rdquo;, even
with the supplied Linux driver, and advises buyers to &ldquo;ignore this
hardware and consider it vestigial&rdquo;. Thank you; I'll get the
optional PCMCIA modem instead of wasting my time. Funny, the more
bad things you say about your products, the better you look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7e700"></a>+Embedded Development Tool: Microwindows</h2></div></div><p>The Microwindows demo was one of our favorites at LinuxWorld.
Imagine a GUI project that includes X- and WinCE-compatible APIs,
alpha blending, proportional fonts, handwriting recognition, a VNC
client, a Minesweeper clone and more. Now imagine it in 100K. Can
you say Linux PDAs? Better put a waterproof cover on them; we're
drooling.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7e808"></a>+Real-Time Tool: Red Hat's RedBoot</h2></div></div><p>RedBoot is an embedded debug and bootstrap tool for running
embedded Linux systems on embedded platforms including ARM, MIPS,
MN10300, PowerPC, Hitachi SHx, v850 and x86. It supports booting
from flash or from the network.</p><p>RedBoot provides ways to address real-time timing
requirements that allow an application to respond quickly to real
world needs. It also provides some important tools to debug in this
environment, which in our opinion is an extremely important issue.
It is also completely open source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7e968"></a>+Toy: CueCat</h2></div></div><p>Meow! This free bar code scanner was handed out at Radio
Shack and included with some magazines (not ours). Not only did
people dissect the kitty to disable its serial number (see the
November 2000 issue) but they also wrote drivers and decoders to
use it for all kinds of things, including cataloging their vast
book collections.</p><p>The CueCat's manufacturer got into the fun by having their
lawyer send out some of the most pointless and ludicrous
threatening letters I've ever seen, which naturally made everyone
get more CueCats to find out what all the fuss was about.</p><p>Apparently the original purpose of the CueCat was to get
people to scan magazine ads instead of typing URLs, which must save
some companies the trouble of learning HTTP Redirects. But, out of
dumb business models come nifty toys.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7eb20"></a>+Book: <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network
Administrator's Guide</em></span>, Second Edition</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</em></span>,
by Olaf Kirch and Terry Dawson, has been a &ldquo;living document&rdquo; from
the Linux Documentation Project since 1993 and still contains one
of the best introductions to TCP/IP we've ever read. The new
edition, released this year, is relevant to more Linux users than
ever, since more and more of us are getting broadband Internet
connections and setting up home networks instead of just using a
PPP dialup. For users looking to take advantage of their DSL or
cable connections, we recommend this book, which is available from
the Linux Documentation Project web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7ecd8"></a>+Web Site: Advogato</h2></div></div><p>Once there was Usenet News and Linus Torvalds announced Linux
there. Then many threads of discussion moved to lists, and web
discussion boards, but forum after forum of intelligent
conversation was stormed and destroyed by flamers and idiots. This
year's chosen web site, Advogato, has been surprisingly
jackass-free and has given us thoughtful discussions on
password-protected textbooks, GNU autoconf, Bill Joy and choosing
the right C data types to make your code 64-bit clean. Advogato is
ruled by the cold equations of a reputation-ranking system, which
has, so far, worked to protect it from the tide of drivel that
washes over the rest of the &ldquo;community&rdquo; sites.</p><p>As a bonus, the Apache module that powers Advogato is fast,
free and in our humble opinion, elegant.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4391f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
+Product of the Year: TiVo
</p></div></div>
</p><p>If you think Linux isn't ready for end users, well, put the
TiVo in your pipe and smoke it. It's this year's hottest home
theater component&mdash;a Linux-powered box that actually lets you
&ldquo;pause&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; live TV. No more waiting for a
commercial to get another beer.</p><p><a href="4391s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
