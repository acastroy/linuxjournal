    Open Source and Open Standards: Chapters One through Three.
    A voyage through one of Loki's free software projects.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1131580.0x1229500"></a></h2></div></div><p>At Loki Entertainment Software, we deal
with lots of different kinds of software. From public domain, to
BSD-licensed source, to Free Software under GPL and LGPL, to
proprietary code under contract and NDAs, to closed source hardware
drivers, we encounter it all on a daily basis. Moreover, we also
write a variety of source. The games we port to Linux are not open
source, but our own work is available as free software in projects
like part of projects like Fenris, Setup, SMPEG or SDL.
</p><p>Crossing the fences from all sides over and over again, and
getting to know both the concerns of free software and open-source
advocates as well as the concerns of publishers and developers, our
priorities have changed. As important as open-source and free
software are, one of our projects in particular developed out of
the recognition that there is something even more important: open,
well-documented standards. That project is OpenAL, and its history
so far is a fair bit of education on how important standards
are&mdash;and how difficult it is to create them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1131580.0x1229660"></a>A Case of Need</h2></div></div><p>With the Linux ports of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heretic2</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear 2</em></span>, Loki encountered engines that
used spatialized sound above and beyond left-right panning.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heretic2</em></span> for a time served as a showcase for
audio hardware manufacturers: Aureal's A3D and Creative's EAX,
specifically, were both supported. Both competitors at that time
had ventured beyond the DirectSound3D feature set and were
following very different approaches to spatialized sound. Windows
game developers, caught between three different APIs (not counting
the large number of commercial audio SDKs offered for Windows),
more often than not chose to ignore the issue altogether and
refrained from implementing advanced features (unless they decided
to go with one of the SDK offerings that promised to provide a
convenient abstraction). The manufacturers stepped up and in many
cases guided the developer's hand in adding EAX or A3D support to
their engines. Spatialized 3-D sound became a checkbox item, a
feature to be listed on the game box, and for a while the Windows
game developers were offered an easy ride.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation for Linux users was quite
different. Driver support for the SB16 de facto standard had
stabilized, and PCI sound cards, all in all, worked reasonably well
under Linux. Yet, no ALSA or OSS-proprietary or open-source support
for the most advanced features and boards was readily
available.</p><p>Developers targeting Apple users found themselves in a
similar situation&mdash;while the multimedia APIs on Mac OS might be
more sophisticated and complete than the Linux solutions, they were
even less compatible with DirectSound and equally oblivious to EAX
and A3D features. Windows developers who cared about portability
faced an audio feature set full of shining promises, but without a
portable API. Given the vastly different approaches of the two main
competitors, things were bound to get worse&mdash;at a time when
Microsoft didn't even provide DirectSound3D for the NT platform
that many developers preferred.</p><p>Creative, a dominant force in the audio hardware market,
found itself challenged by Aureal, a company that attempted to take
its experience with high-end spatialized sound solutions into the
PC consumer market. Aureal proposed &ldquo;wavetracing&rdquo;, a proprietary
approach to generating spatialized sound by simulation of sound
propagation and acoustic properties of a scene&mdash;essentially, by
submitting scene geometry to the sound driver. It is important to
understand that to a much larger degree than graphics, audio
technology was, and still is, software-based. Both the viable
market for SDKs, like Miles Sound System or QSound's QMixer, and
the evolution of the competing hardware drivers are clear
indications of this. Aureal's advantage was their knowledge of
simulation, the calculation of early reflections and a lot of
optimization work for their drivers. Their disadvantage was the PC
consumer market, an environment in which cheap speakers are added
to budget solutions as an afterthought. Moving high-end audio
processing out of the laboratory and away from the individual
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), on a desktop where most
users and most developers didn't really spend much thought on
spatialization, proved to be extraordinarily difficult and, as we
now know, ultimately fatal.</p><p>Despite operating at diminishing returns for all their
efforts, Aureal managed to accomplish one thing: to awaken interest
and tentative user demand for better 3-D audio in games. For early
adopters, it became a selling point, and publishers and developers
followed eventually. Creative, which had their own road map to
future audio features, countered by emphasizing their own extended
feature set&mdash;a much simpler solution focused on stochastic
reverberation to emulate the effect of late reflections. In a way,
the early and late reflection solutions are complements but the
API's and implementations were fundamentally different, and
Creative had picked well: EAX was easier and simpler to use, and
for all the lack for simulation accuracy, stochastic reverb proved
to be a much more effective audio cue for the noisy, low-end
speaker desktop.</p><p>Both companies were considering Linux initiatives. On one
hand, Aureal had a complete software implementation of
&ldquo;wavetracing&rdquo;, eventually marketed as &ldquo;A2D&rdquo; to support the A3D
feature set on their competitors' sound cards that could have been
the base of a proprietary or even open-source sample
implementation. On the other hand, Aureal's code base was a heavily
optimized assembly, and a Linux port was not a foregone conclusion.
Creative, on the other hand, recruited Linux coders to develop
drivers in-house and looked for ways to support EAX under Linux.
Both APIs were written with respect to Microsoft's DirectX and COM,
but Aureal's geometry-based A3D API had also been inspired by the
OpenGL API. This was one of many examples on the influence of
OpenGL on the development of OpenAL.</p><p>Enter the game developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1131580.0x1229a80"></a>Scratching the Itch</h2></div></div><p>Even before the days of EAX and A3D, some game developers
were looking for a portable sound solution. The OpenGL-GameDev
mailing list, which hosts more than its average share of developers
interested in portable code, spawned in 1998 a list dedicated to
discussion of a new, open audio library&mdash;tentatively named OpenAL.
Proposals were written and posted, and several developers spent
significant time coming up with a good solution. However, it
quickly became apparent that between us, &ldquo;good&rdquo; was measured by
very different metrics. Some of the subscribers were mainly
interested in music and composition, solidly grounded in a sound
synthesis background. Others cared only about spatialized sound, as
it was in the days of DirectSound3D. Some preferred explicit,
sophisticated OOP design in the API, while others wanted solutions
that were less assuming. For all those efforts, little more than a
few headers and a white paper were written, and over the months the
project lost focus and tapered out. Lack of consensus and maybe a
lack of experience in cooperative efforts contributed to this early
failure, but to a much larger degree it was the lack of precise
objectives, and the sheer variety of &ldquo;audio&rdquo; features to deal
with, that doomed the first OpenAL effort not once, but twice. In
early 1999, a resurrection occurred, coinciding with a brief
mention of OpenAL in Jonathan Blow's roundup of Sound API's and
SDK's for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game Developer Magazine</em></span> (May 1999).
Published as a sidebar, Terry Sikes (who had written the 1998 white
paper) and I stated the objectives of OpenAL. At that time, Aureal
was considering a revised, portable A3D API, and our statement
emphasized interoperability with OpenGL as a desirable property for
a portable audio library, especially if processing geometry.
Neither Aureal nor the OpenAL mailing list made significant
progress in their separate efforts, and it wasn't until late 1999
that another company decided to get involved: Loki.</p><p>Work on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heretic2</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy
Gear 2</em></span> was commencing at that time, and while we were
not (and, truth to be told, still are not) in a position to support
EAX or A3D, it became obvious that some solution was needed. The
minimum we needed was a Linux implementation of the feature set of
DirectSound3D: distance attenuation and Doppler Effect,
spatialization in 3-D, pitch and directional sound cones. Beyond
that, it would obviously be desirable to talk to IHVs like Creative
and Aureal and nurture their tentative interest in Linux drivers.
Loki approached contributors to the original OpenAL discussion, set
up a mailing list, committed one developer, the esteemed Joseph I.
Valenzuela, full-time to the software sample implementation, and
the three of us set out to work. Michael Vance, the lead coder on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear 2</em></span>, and myself (working on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heretic2</em></span>) revisited the original OpenAL
discussion and the existing proposals. A number of decisions, in
particular the commitment to OpenGL-like conventions and API
design, were taken with an eye on the past failures. Of course, the
problem domain &ldquo;audio&rdquo; is very different from graphics by any
account, but a lot of discussions were avoided by applying GL-like
syntax wherever applicable. Initially, we expected a good deal of
the API to handle geometry in explicit ways, just as A3D did, but
we also applied the same reasoning to other parts of the OpenAL
interface. Mimicking GL only got us so far: OpenAL is essentially a
scene graph API, with a lot of explicit objects. We deviated from
GL on other accounts as well: OpenAL has less entry points and more
tokens, which has advantages for changing and deprecating API
mechanisms while preserving ABI backward compatibility. We adopted
a separation into AL, ALC, ALU and ALUT libraries (in loose analogy
to GL, GLX/WGL, GLU and GLUT) but almost exclusively focused on the
core AL API. Short-term itches led to immediate scratching, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear 2</em></span> was heading toward being the
first Loki game to ship along with the first OpenAL sample
implementation. Even at that early stage, our OpenAL maintainer
found himself in valiant struggle to keep the library in sync with
the ever-changing specification drafts.</p><p>It was well before the Game Developer's Conference (GDC) in
March 2000 in San Jose, that Creative expressed interest in OpenAL.
To complement their own Linux driver work, and with respect to
portability and acceptance, a vendor-neutral, OS agnostic API had
become increasingly attractive for IHV's. Microsoft did not exhibit
interest in extending DirectSound3D, and the Interactive Audio
Special Interest Group (IASIG), which had published Interactive 3-D
Level 1 and Level 2 guidelines, did not consider itself in the
business of specifying API's. Loki had tried its best to keep the
implementation and the specification suitable for purposes beyond
our short-term needs, and we were quite serious about the &ldquo;Open&rdquo;
part of the project, but the interest expressed by Creative and
others was a surprise that changed the rules. Beyond helping us in
getting Linux ports of games feature complete, OpenAL now had IHV
backing that might eventually establish it as a standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1131580.0x1229e48"></a>A Larger Stage</h2></div></div><p>Loki and Creative announced their initiative during GDC, and
we published the initial specification draft written by Michael
Vance. Since then, the scope and requirements have changed quite a
bit, and a lot of additional work was done during the last
half-year. While our original focus was solely on 3-D spatialized
sound, we now have to support stereo and multichannel formats, some
of which (like MP3) are quite proprietary. Compression and
streaming proved to be difficult issues. More than one solution was
implemented, and it was a suggestion from Ian Ollman on the OpenAL
mailing list which led to the adoption of buffer queueing to handle
streaming audio. The more actual and potential features we had to
account for, the more paranoia had to be applied to the API.
Backward compatibility was broken not once, not twice, but several
times, with extensions added to keep deprecated features available
for the games we had already shipped: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Soldier of
Fortune</em></span> followed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear 2</em></span> and
was followed by <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited</em></span>. By
now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal Tournament</em></span> uses OpenAL as well,
and upcoming ports of games based on the UT license will inherit
this feature. Cognitoy's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mindrover</em></span> uses OpenAL
under Linux, and they, as well as a few other Windows developers,
await the release of Win32 OpenAL drivers with hardware support. At
the moment, practically all games that use OpenAL do so under
Linux, but other platforms will hopefully follow soon.</p><p>Between three of us at Loki, and Jean-Marc Jot, Garin
Hiebert, Carlo Vogelsang and others from Creative Labs, the OpenAL
specification has progressed to a final draft of the version 1.0&mdash;a
reasonably complete, solid foundation that covers the DirectSound3D
feature set, at the same time deviating from it in many details.
For example, buffers are strictly separate from sources and are
shared among them. Some of the differences are rather subtle, like
the distinction between clamping and reference distances, or the
explicit definition of the reference velocity used in Doppler
calculations. In some cases, like the handling of multichannel
data, we still strive to get away with a minimal extension to the
API.</p><p>To a degree, the biggest accomplishment at this stage is not
so much the Specification Draft itself, but what we have learned in
the process. While we are still far from finished, we have
established a work flow and a reference for RFC's, proposals,
discussions and revisions. We borrowed a little from the IETF and
quite a lot from the way OpenGL is extended and modified. The
toolchain we currently rely on&mdash;the SGML version of the DocBook
DTD, and the respective Linux parser and formatting tools&mdash;comes
with a couple of loose ends, and while the document has become more
modular, the layout and rendering leaves a lot to be desired.
Extensions have been proposed for various features, but
implementations have not yet been provided. Our decision to follow
the example SGI set with OpenGL&mdash;in several senses&mdash;has preserved
the initial momentum that vanished from the earlier OpenAL efforts.
In a way, choosing the name &ldquo;OpenAL&rdquo; has to be understood as a
clear commitment to a vendor-neutral, open solution, and I think we
have kept the promise.</p><p>The next milestone will be the official closure on the final
draft of the 1.0 specification, followed by releases of hardware
OpenAL drivers for Windows, Linux and other platforms. To fulfill
its promise, OpenAL will depend on efficient driver support, a task
that has to be addressed by Creative and other IHVs. Loki
encourages IHVs to try open-source solutions, but the ultimate
decision is theirs. This is a necessary side effect of an open
standard&mdash;just as every free software project has the right to
implement the OpenAL API, companies can choose to implement
proprietary versions. Given the relative importance of optimized
implementations and improved algorithms for audio SDKs and drivers,
it will take time to make a case for shared infrastructure and open
source.</p><p>Beyond the current specification, we have now a much clearer
roadmap for the OpenAL 1.1 revision. The feature set defined by the
IASIG I3DL2 guidelines, which are largely based on submissions by
Creative, will be added as a vendor-specific extension, aiming for
a vendor neutral solution in 1.1. A lot of feature requests and
additions have to be reviewed, as issues we set aside for OpenAL
1.0 have to be resolved. Given the small amount of users at this
time, we have already gotten some rather unexpected and quite
surprising inquiries. The context handling API, ALC, will have to
prove itself on several platforms before we can confidently expect
that, unlike OpenGL, we will have a portable solution at the
context/device level as well. The API, currently minimizing entry
points at the expense of tokens, might find a different balance
once the semantics are found stable. Meanwhile, we continue to port
new games, and while each one has its own different idea about
resource and state management, we find the existing API to be quite
sufficient. Aside from new, orthogonal features like microphone
capture, the majority of the work required is related to streaming
and additional codecs. Ironically, the API road map does not aim
for handling reflection and occlusion geometry at this point. While
it still might make sense to explicitly support large reflectors,
the game engines are usually much better equipped to determine
obstruction and occlusion, and our objective for OpenAL has shifted
to allow the application coder to express the consequences of such
conditions. The battlefield has shifted to questions about use of
OpenAL for composition instead of straightforward spatialization,
generalization of vendor-specific features or abstraction of
proprietary solutions. HRTFs, initially considered to be outside
the scope of AL and better left to device configuration and driver
implementation, have emerged as a possible addition, based on
Sensaura's work in this area. Support for Dolby, which was on
Aureal's road map, would probably be desirable as well. The
implications of the Khronos Initiative for streaming multimedia,
spearheaded by SGI, with respect to OpenAL has to be
clarified&mdash;like OpenGL, extensions for interoperability might be
added to OpenAL in the future.</p><p>Beyond the design and coding work, OpenAL's organization will
have to evolve. What is currently a loose cooperation between
volunteers, with a few companies thrown into the mix, will have to
be established as a nonprofit organization. Again borrowing from
OpenGL's example, there will be an architecture review board, a
voting process and all the other structures that come with
incorporating open standards. Unlike OpenGL, the sample
implementation and the eventually written conformance test suite
will be open source. Much like OpenGL, the use of the trademark
will be restricted to those who passed the conformance test in some
authorized, official way.</p><p>The importance of all this is exemplified by Brian Paul's
Mesa: like no other free software project I can think of, his clean
room implementation of the OpenGL API has, over more than five
years, led to the hardware accelerated, 3-D-graphics-capable Linux
machines we have today. It was Mesa that provided the framework,
and 3dfx's Linux Glide that provided the driver, which brought
hardware rendering to Linux (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>) gaming in
the first place. Without SGI's diligent work on their OpenGL
specification, and their support for Brian Paul, we might not have
the DRI open-source solutions for Linux and probably would not have
the proprietary NVidia drivers either. If anything, we want OpenAL
to match what OpenGL accomplished for Linux and other non-Windows
platforms. For Loki, the most important goal now is to get hardware
support on Linux&mdash;and Windows: ultimately, we want our fellow game
developers to choose open standards over closed ones.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1131580.0x122a370"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Was it worth it? We did get more on our hands than we
bargained for, but if the work we have done so far helps in
establishing another portable API, the answer is a definite yes.
Linux has only just started to face the issues of standardization
and certification, and personally, my respect for the IETF has
multiplied several times. The Linux Standard Base (LSB) definitely
has their work cut out for them and will need all support it can
get. Beyond the LSB, the Linux Desktop will need a Multimedia API
supplement and Special Interest Group to give ISVs and IHVs alike
some ground to stand on&mdash;not to mention all those free software and
spare time projects struggling to be portable. It might well be
that Linux hackers and users alike underestimate the importance
that the DirectX set of services had for Windows at large and games
on Windows in particular. It is also possible that many Linux
developers still underestimate the importance of the desktop.
However, Linux is only one of many platforms that need a
comprehensive set of portable multimedia APIs. If OpenAL succeeds
in defining another building block for such an OS agnostic
&ldquo;OpenX&rdquo;, we will have accomplished much more than we initially
expected.</p><p><a href="4400s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
