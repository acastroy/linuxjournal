    Seven Linux enthusiasts decided that it would be cool to
    broadcast their own radio show over the Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fb5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Five great minds got together and decided
that broadcasting over the Internet would be cool&mdash;plain and
simple. Five great minds quickly turned to seven and an Internet
radio station at
<a href="http://www.opensourceradio.com" target="_self">http://www.opensourceradio.com/</a>
was born. The open-source Community has made this internet radio
station possible by supplying all the software components. Two main
hardware components are necessary to broadcast on the Internet: a
broadcast server and an encoder client. It is not a requirement to
separate the server and the client, they can be run on the same
machine, but we chose to use two different systems at two different
locations to generate our output.
</p><p>We play MP3-encoded material during our radio show. LAME and
Liveice convert the audio output to MP3-encoded specifications so
anyone with xmms or Winamp can decode our signal. Broadcasting
MP3-encoded material at this time does not require any licensing,
however it is anticipated that in the year 2001 royalties will be
collected by the agency holding the patent. You can obtain more
information regarding these issues at www.mp3licensing.com. If the
company that holds the patent imposes royalties, we plan to move to
a different encode, decode schema. Ogg Vorbis is a patent and
royalty-free compressed audio formatter that we anticipate moving
our broadcast server to in the near future. Ogg Vorbis is available
at <a href="http://www.xiph.org" target="_self">www.xiph.org</a>. Also, the
MP3 licensing does not cover issues regarding broadcasting
copyrighted material to a public audience so if you plan to run an
Internet radio station, be certain you have permission to broadcast
anything for which you do not hold the copyright.</p><p>We use standard hardware because we found quickly that
obscure components introduce unnecessary delays in the setup
process. The rest of this article details the setup of each
component in our internet radio station. We also describe any
problems that we encountered along the way. Please understand that
there are a million ways to create an internet radio station, and
the choices we made were not due to any alliance with any
vendor&mdash;we simply made it work in the following mannner.</p><p>Figure 1 gives an overview of our network that starts when it
gets our voices to an MP3 player. We speak into microphones, the
microphones convert our voice to analog and the mixer condenses the
stream into the line-in on the encoder client that runs Liveice.
Liveice picks up the stream and uses LAME to convert our voice from
analog to digital. Liveice then sends our digitized stream out onto
the Internet to our defined broadcast server that runs Icecast.
Icecast takes the incoming stream and broadcasts it onto the
Internet at both the destination and port
www.opensourceradio.com:8000. Once it is on the Internet, any
decoding client, such as an MP3 player, can pick up the stream and
decode our digital stream to audio output.</p><p>

Overview</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fba80"></a>Server Requirements</h2></div></div><p>We wanted to succeed right away so we acquired a domain,
static IP and a server with open ports. A static IP and domain are
not necessary, but by making everything static we don't need to
inform our listener base every time our ISP changes our IP. We also
connected our server to the Internet via a T1. This gives us the
bandwidth to provide high-quality broadcasting. Our broadcast
server, Linux3 and our static IP are provided by
www.doitwebcorp.com. The server is a standard networked PC running
Red Hat Linux 6.2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fbb88"></a>Server Setup</h2></div></div><p>We started by downloading the Icecast server software from
www.icecast.org. We chose to use version 1.3.7 because it was
considered the most stable release available at the time. We used
the default installation that locates the binaries in
/usr/local/icecast. The configuration of the Icecast server is very
simple, you only need to change one file. The icecast.conf file is
very informative. The sections we changed allow the encoder client
to send streaming audio to the broadcast server that will be
serving to the Internet. Our server is set up with the IP address
63.101.145.11 with the registered domain of
www.opensourceradio.com. If you compare the default icecast.conf
file to our example icecast.conf file, you will see the fields that
we changed. This is only a portion of the icecast.conf file, as it
is a very large file.</p><p><a href="4397l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Example Configuration
File for Icecast</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fbd40"></a>Starting Icecast</h2></div></div><p>Icecast is very simple to run. Go into the account you want
your broadcast server to run as and enter
<b  >/usr/local/icecast/bin/icecast</b>. This brings you
to console mode on the Icecast server. If you type a &ldquo;?&rdquo; at the
console you see all of the options that are available with Icecast.
We would like to note that from the console you can see when
someone connects to the site. If you start Icecast with a -b option
it pushes the console to the background. Figure 2 is a screen
capture of the startup of Icecast.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4397f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc058"></a>Icecast Console</h2></div></div><p>The Icecast console is a powerful tool that allows you to
control all aspects of the server. For example, if you wish to get
rid of particular listeners, you could use the kick command to boot
them. Another useful command is dump, which allows you to dump a
stream to a file. The full list of commands is available in the
Icecast web interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc160"></a>Web Administration Interface</h2></div></div><p>Icecast includes a web-based administration interface that
can be accessed by entering the URL
http://hostname.domain:port/admin, where hostname is your Icecast
server and port is the port number that you defined in the
icecast.conf file (see Listing 1). By default the web-based Icecast
administration utility is wide open to any system, so be sure to
set a password. The help section on the admin page gives detailed
descriptions on how to use the web interface. The descriptions
include topics that range from setting up user authorization to
even disabling the web interface. One of the most useful features
of the web interface is a dynamic listing of sources and listener
streams. You can configure the administration pages to meet your
needs. Refer to the admministration interface for more
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc268"></a>Server Security</h2></div></div><p>Any site on the Internet should be concerned with security.
We recommend that you read all the security documentation that
comes with the Icecast server. We also recommend that you do not
run the Icecast server as root. You should run the server as nobody
or a nonprivileged user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc370"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>We did not experience any problems with the Icecast setup and
configuration. Icecast itself is very similar to a typical web
server, and it is simple to configure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc478"></a>Encoder Client</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc580"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Our set up uses a remote encoder client that is not located
on the same system as our Icecast server. We use the Liveice client
software to generate the output to be streamed to the Icecast
server. We use a standard workstation, named zelda, running
Mandrake Linux 7.2 with a 16-bit SoundBlaster (ES1371) sound card.
We chose the SoundBlaster since it is a widely known and easily
supported piece of hardware for our purposes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19fc688"></a>Encoder Setup</h2></div></div><p>We started the Liveice software installation by downloading
the tar file that we found at
<a href="http://www.icecast.org" target="_self">http://www.icecast.org/</a>
in the third party applications section. We did not find an RPM at
icecast.org. Untar puts the files in our current working directory.
Liveice also requires that we run a make to compile the binaries.
The README file explains the full installation of Liveice. We put
the files in <b  >/usr/local</b> to make things simple
and accessible via the current path. We changed the liveice.cfg
file to point to the broadcast server. You can compare our
icecast.conf (above) and our liveice.cfg (below) with the defaults
to see where you have to make changes. The README file on the
Liveice client offers a better understanding of each parameter. The
most important paramenters include SERVER, PORT, PASSWORD and
USE_LAME3.</p><p>SERVER is the server name that we used setup to the Icecast
server. PORT is the port number on the Icecast server. The PASSWORD
field must match the Icecast password to allow for the socket
connection between Liveice and Icecast. The field USE_LAME3 tells
Liveice which encoder to use to convert from analog to digital. The
configuration we used works for our purposes, but there are
numerous other configurations that accomplish the same
output.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>LAME is an application that we downloaded from
http://www.sulaco.org/ and we untarred it in the
<b  >/usr/bin/</b> directory. If you put it in a
directory that isn't in your $PATH, you have to put the full path
to the encoder in the liveice.cfg file. The encoder is necessary to
turn your voice into a digital MP3 format to be received by the
Icecast server and broadcast over the Internet. We chose to use
LAME, but you can use any encoder engine that you wish to use.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19f35a0"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>We did not encounter any problems with either the LAME or
Liveice setup and configuration. They conform to the open-source
standard and are very simple to set up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19f36a8"></a>Line Input</h2></div></div><p>We purchased an audio mixer that allows multiple microphones
to send audio into the line-in port on the sound card.
<span   class="bold"><b>xqmixer</b></span> recognizes the sound card
as audio in to send the stream through LAME to be encoded and send
output through the Liveice client. After the Liveice client
receives the input, the client streams the output over the Internet
to our Icecast server. Icecast receives the stream from Liveice and
relays it back to the Internet in an MP3 format to be interpreted
by any MP3 decoder client that our listeners choose to use.
<span   class="bold"><b>Xmms</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Winamp</b></span> seem to be the most popular
programs to decode MP3 streams.</p><p>The mixer provides a greater range of input options. We can
run a CDROM, microphones or an MP3 player right into the mixer and
out to the Internet. The open-source radio show runs a full range
of input to give the true radio feel when we broadcast. We use an
audio mixer with six ports for input. Each host has his own
microphone that jacks into the mixer, which then connects into the
line-in port of the sound card. Any device that generates audio
output can be plugged into the line-in port on the sound
card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19f3910"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>Liveice requires specific audio input quality. The sound
card, while it receives input, is still controlled by the tools
within the operating system. In our case we use xqmixer to control
the sound card hardware. On xqmixer, the record volume controls the
streaming rate that Liveice receives as input. If the record volume
is set too low, you will not hear any output. If it is set too
high, Liveice clips the audio. Clipping is an audio engineering
term that describes what happens when the audio signal is too
strong for the hardware to handle&mdash;it &ldquo;clips&rdquo; off part of the
signal, making it sound terrible. We adjusted our sound quality by
tuning the record volume. It's simple: fire up your station and
listen to yourself. If you do not hear anything, increase the
record volume. If the playout is clipping, reduce the record volume
until you get it right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1903580.0x19f3a18"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The http://www.opensourceradio.com/ show runs every Thursday
night from 8:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. EST. We discuss open-source
issues and use the full range of our mixing and MP3 conversion
capabilities. Anyone can do what we have done. With the exception
of the mixer, the computer hardware and the T1 connection,
everything was free. You can easily download all of the software
from the Internet to create an Internet radio station. We would
also like to say that despite our sound, no small animals are
injured during the course of our broadcast.</p><p><a href="4397s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
