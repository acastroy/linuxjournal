    Help on getting these three powerhouses playing well together.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x1598348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently, I was looking for a calendar
system that would allow me to keep track of events, appointments
and project dates. Quite a few of the applications that I looked at
were written in PHP and used a database to keep track of events.
Since I had already planned on configuring an extra computer for
use as a web server, I figured that it wouldn't be much more work
to add PHP and MySQL to it. This article covers my experiences of
installing all the components and getting everything running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x1598450"></a>Equipment Used</h2></div></div><p>The computer I decided to make into my web server was an old
90 MHz Pentium computer with 40 MB of RAM and around a gigabyte of
hard drive space, running Caldera's OpenLinux 2.3.</p><p>I wanted to use the latest stable versions of Apache, PHP and
MySQL, so I uninstalled the existing Apache package and downloaded
the sources for Apache 1.3.12 and PHP 4.0.3, along with the
binaries for MySQL 3.22.32.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x15985b0"></a>Apache Dynamic Modules</h2></div></div><p>While Apache has always been module-based, Apache 1.3 can
load and unload modules, called Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs), as
they are needed. Apache 1.3 includes a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>apxs</b></span> (APache eXtenSion) that
automates the process of building DSO's outside of the Apache
source tree and configuring Apache to use them.</p><p>Two reasons for using dynamic modules in Apache are
performance and flexibility. Dynamic modules allow the PTP
interpreter to be loaded into the Apache process when needed. This
prevents the creation of a new interpreter process with each
request (as CGI requires), but allows Apache to load the module
only when needed, saving resources.</p><p>Dynamic modules also allow functionality to be added, removed
or changed without the need to recompile the entire Apache server
and possibly lose existing functionality.</p><p>While compiling PHP as a DSO on my home network was more of a
thought exercise than a requirement, it could be important in some
installations. Be aware that there are security issues dependent on
whether PHP is a dynamic module or run as a CGI. Take a look at the
documentation on the Apache and PHP sites for detailed security
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x1598818"></a>Installing the Software</h2></div></div><p>Since I was installing PHP as a dynamic Apache module, Apache
had to be installed before PHP.</p><p>While Apache is installed by default in most Linux
distributions, it may not support dynamic modules. To see if your
version of Apache supports them, execute the command <b  >httpd
-l</b> which lists the modules that have been compiled into
Apache (httpd may not e in your PATH, in which case you need to
find where Apache is currently installed). If
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_so.c</b></span> appears in the list of
modules, then your Apache server can use dynamic modules. If it
isn't in the list you can still use PHP, as a CGI program without
recompiling Apache. Enabling DSO will require a recompile.</p><p>To compile Apache to use dynamic modules, I used the
following configure command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure -enable-module=most --enable-shared=max.
</pre><p>These options enable most of the modules included with the
Apache source and indicates that they should be built as dynamic
shared objects. Other configuration variations are detailed in the
README.configure file in the Apache source directory.
</p><p>When the configure script was finished, I compiled and
installed Apache with the <b  >make</b> and <b  >make
install</b> commands. Next, I issued <b  >apachectl
start</b> to start the Apache server.</p><p>After Apache was installed and running, the next step was to
install MySQL because the PHP configure script needed to know where
it was. I unpacked the MySQL package that I had and followed the
directions for installing and starting the MySQL server.</p><p>Once Apache and MySQL were installed and running, it was time
to install PHP 4. I unpacked the PHP sources and ran the configure
script. The options depend on whether you want to use PHP as a
shared Apache module or as a stand alone program.</p><p>Since I wanted PHP to run as a dynamic Apache module and use
MySQL, I ran the configure script as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure -with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs&lt;\n&gt;
-with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql
</pre><p>This tells the configure script to build PHP as a shared
Apache module and to include support for MySQL. If your Apache and
MySQL base directories are where PHP expects to find them, you
don't need to specify the path names, but I found it easier to
specify them.
</p><p>The first time I ran the configure script it complained that
it couldn't find the <span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>bison</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>flex</b></span> utilities on my system. I
installed them from my Caldera CD and ran the configuration script
again, this time successfully.</p><p>Next, I compiled PHP by running the <b  >make</b>
command. Once all the source files were compiled successfully, I
installed PHP with the <b  >make install</b>
command.</p><p>Before Apache could use PHP, it had to know about the PHP
module and when to use it. The apxs program took care of telling
Apache about the PHP 4 module, so all that was left to do was tell
Apache about .php files. File types are controlled in the
httpd.conf file, and it usually includes lines about PHP that are
commented out. I uncommented the following line, <b  >Addtype
application/x-httpd-php .php</b>, and restarted Apache by
issuing the <b  >apachectl restart</b> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x15991b8"></a>Testing PHP</h2></div></div><p>Now that everything was installed, it was time to see if PHP
actually worked. For that I created the following simple
page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;\n&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;PHP Test&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;?phpinfo() ?&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Notice that PHP commands are contained by
<b  >&lt;?</b> and <b  >?&gt;</b> tags. I saved
the file as <b  >test.php</b> in Apache's htdocs
directory and aimed my browser at
<tt  >http://localhost/test.php</tt>
A page appeared with the PHP logo and quite a bit of
information about my PHP configuration, so I knew that PHP was
working. If you see <b  >&lt;?phpinfo() ?&gt;</b> and
nothing else, make sure that the line in httpd.conf that adds the
PHP type to Apache is uncommented and that Apache has been
restarted. If your problems persist, both the Apache and PHP web
sites contain information on using PHP and Apache together.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a0580.0x1599528"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Once I knew that Apache and PHP were working, I installed the
PHP calendar program that I had chosen by simply copying its PHP
files into a directory under Apache's htdocs directory. I now had a
web server, a very powerful HTML embedded scripting language and a
calendar system. In addition to costing nothing, I also have the
source code for all the software so I can see how they work.</p></div></div>
