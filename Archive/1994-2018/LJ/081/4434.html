music in your office? What about in elevators? I bet you sometimes
stand in the elevator thinking, &ldquo;You know, I bet if I just hit
this little red button.&rdquo; That type of thinking is caused by
elevator music. It never fails; unless you are employed by a
progressive company, you will end up listening to artists that
either: have been dead longer than you have been alive or make
their money reproducing songs &aacute; la elevator music.
</p><p>Obviously, this is a problem. A common solution for
management is either to put everybody in cubicles, where they end
up like trolls but can listen to their own music, or to dictate the
music to be played.</p><p>The advent of personal jukeboxes like the NOMAD from Creative
Labs (see Resources) can solve some of these problems. They have
long play times, and the NOMAD can store over 150 CDs of music,
something a walkman could never do. The problem with players is the
word &ldquo;personal&rdquo;. You can't share your general music interest;
plus, they are $500.00 US apiece.</p><p>The population of networks within the office and the
proliferation of MP3 technology has spawned a new type of player.
It is called MSERV. MSERV is a piece of open-source software that
allows an office to turn a PC-running Linux, or another open-source
operating system, into an MP3 jukebox; it's a lot like a personal
jukebox but with centralized capabilities for the entire
office.</p><p>When I first downloaded MSERV, I thought it was something
other than what it is; I thought it was a broadcast server. In my
mind it would be great to have over 500 CDs worth of music sitting
on one hard drive that I or anyone else could access from their
local web browser. We could set up our own play lists and listen to
any music we wanted, separately. After realizing exactly what MSERV
was, I had to readjust my thinking. I am glad that I did; MSERV
provided the people in our office a compromise with regard to the
music we listen to. A technical description of MSERV would be:
client/server, TCP/IP-based, central music deployment and ranking
software. In short, it is like a Web Board Poll for MP3
listeners.</p><p>From an end-user standpoint, MSERV is a dream come true. It
is specifically designed to play only the songs that people in the
office want to hear. For example, if you have ten people who all
enjoy the Eagles but only one who enjoys Yanni, that one person is
out of luck. Why? Because MSERV uses a ranking system to pick the
songs it plays. The ranking system is completely controlled by the
user.</p><p>Let's say you are plugging away at your current
geek-of-the-week task, and for some insane reason, a strange noise
starts emitting from the overhead speaker. You're not sure, but it
sounds like something your mother used to listen to. Instead of
complaining and grumbling through your day, you fire up the good
old web browser (hopefully not IE) and point it to the local MSERV
machine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;</em></span>, you were correct, it is
something your mother used to listen to. It's the Righteous
Brothers and you saw <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dirty Dancing</em></span> one too
many times to ever want to hear them again. Don't despair! MSERV
allows you, the end user, to rank them into oblivion with one
little click.</p><p>Of course, if everyone else loves them, they can rank them
right back up, and you will hear it hour after hour, but at least
some power has been given back to the end user.</p><p>The installation of MSERV is not difficult. The web site
offers source, tar and rpm-based versions of the software. If you
are running an RPM-based system (and the majority of systems out
there are), then you'd type, as root, <b  >rpm -i
mserv-0.33-1.i386.rpm</b>. This will install all of the
required components.</p><p>Once the program is installed, log in as a normal user. As
the non-root user, you may start MSERV by entering the
<b  >/usr/bin</b> directory and typing
<b  >MSERV</b>. When MSERV starts, it will create a
directory in the non-root users' home called
<b  >.mserv</b>. The <b  >.mserv</b> directory
is where the configuration and password files live.</p><p>MSERV comes with a web client. The web client is very simple
to install. It only requires that Perl be on your system and that
the ExecCGI option be turned on in the directory that you install
into. Just copy the web client files to the URL that you would like
to serve them from. For example, if your document root for your web
server is <b  >/usr/local/apache/htdocs</b>, you can
install the files in
<b  >/usr/local/apache/htdocs/mserv</b>. Once you have
edited the <b  >httpd.conf</b> for the ExecCGI option,
restart the Apache server. You should be able to point your web
browser to your URL and have MSERV come up.</p><p>Once Apache is loading the pages correctly, you will want to
change a couple of parameters in the
<span   class="bold"><b>mserv.cgi</b></span> program. You can find it
under the installed path. The main parameter you are looking for is
the $host line. The $host line is the line that tells MSERV where
to look for the programs.</p><p>If a web client is not what you are looking for, MSERV has a
CLI and MS Windows client as well. The CLI is a Command Line
Interface client and basically acts like a Telnet client. The MS
Windows client is written in Delphi. Unfortunately, we were unable
to test the Delphi version, as we don't run Windows.</p><p>The Delphi-based client is good for offices. As we all know,
the majority of offices out there still run MS Windows, and having
a Delphi client makes sense. Besides, consider it a proliferation
option. First an MP3 server on Linux, then a mail server, then a
web server, then a desktop, etc. Before long everybody will be
running KDE2, and nobody will know the difference.</p><p>If you are a developer, MSERV offers a wealth of
opportunities for improvement. That is not to say that MSERV is a
bad product, exactly the opposite. But like most open-source
projects, it needs polish. It needs a simple install and configure
program, something beyond RPM or compiling. It needs a prettier
front end, and it needs to be centralized, but also offer
broadcasting capabilities.</p><p>MSERV offers an opportunity to provide a new product to the
market. Here are some examples: a jukebox in the back of a car that
directly interfaces with the stereo&mdash;just like CD-based jukeboxes
but not limited to ten CDs per cartridge. Instead, you are limited
only to the size of the hard drive you put in it. You can purchase
an 82 gig hard drive for $300.00 US&mdash;82 gigs of hard drive space is
large enough to hold approximately 2,000 CDs worth of music.</p><p>Another example would be a set-top box. You could connect a
little box to your stereo at home and have all of your CDs
available instantly. You could even set it up so that as soon as
you put in a new CD it would check the CD information from CDDB and
start ripping the CD into an MP3 archive.</p><p>If you were to add remote control services to either of
these, you would have instant emperor-like status among couch
potatoes.</p><p>MSERV is only in release 0.33, and it is not considered
stable. We at Command Prompt, Inc. World Headquarters, a
three-person company, have been using it for almost three weeks.
The consensus is that we like it and that it is stable. If you have
a resident geek in-house, give MSERV a try. It's a fun little
product and actually provides a useful solution to a common
problem. The true power of the program is in the open-source nature
of the product. Anybody can develop for it, and anybody can extend
it. But then again, you're reading <i  >Linux Journal</i>. You already know this.</p><p><a href="4434s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
