liveliness, community. Consensus isn't important. What's important
is how the generative power of our thought makes life vivid and

ZELLERATE</h2></div></div><p>Once again we're writing about something before it's
happened, for publication afterward. Dig this: where I am, it's
still October, the windows are wide open on the 26th floor above
West 56th in Manhattan, and the leaves on the trees in Central Park
are just starting to turn color. Where you are, every one of those
leaves is mulch and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span> has long since
morphed into Zelerate.</p><p>Which is what really matters, for this story. The leaves fall
every year. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span> can shed its name but
once.</p><p>It makes sense, of course. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span>
was founded by two unrelated guys named Ferber (Coincidence? Yes).
And a quick check of Google (whose collection of umpty-thousand
Linux machines has intimate knowledge of 1,247,340,000 web pages)
discloses some persuasive statistics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>open = 31,000,000</p></li><li><p>sales = 18,100,000</p></li><li><p>open sales = 801,000</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;open sales&rdquo; = 5,180</p></li><li><p>zelerate = 0</p></li></ul></div><p>In other words, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span> was a good
example of applied generics. You couldn't ask for better camouflage
if your name ended with &ldquo;Solutions&rdquo;.
</p><p>So what's with Zelerate?</p><p>Paul Carlstrom, the company's director of corporate
communications, says this: &ldquo;Rob and Glenn (Ferber)...cofounded
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span> to offer open-source e-commerce
applications in 1998. A lot has occurred since that time: The GPL'd
software has caught the attention of a growing cadre of developers.
The product has matured rapidly. The installed base of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sales</em></span> AllCommerce has risen...&rdquo;</p><p>Soon, the company found itself doing &ldquo;accelerated commerce
solutions&rdquo;. And, &ldquo;because we feel you can't get from (a) to (z)
without knowing where (z) is located, we've chosen the last letter
of the alphabet to start our name.&rdquo;</p><p>Carlstrom also wants us to know that open source is what
primarily accounts for development speed&mdash;for two reasons.</p><p>One is that &ldquo;we have expanded the open-source model to
include customer-mandated direction as part of our development
process.&rdquo;</p><p>The other is that Zelerate isn't a product company. it sells
service. With enterprise-class applications, he explains,
&ldquo;e-commerce packages can cost in the hundreds of thousands of
dollars, and the customer will still end up paying more for
services and support than for the original licensing fees.&rdquo; By not
making development secretive, Zelerate allows constant customer
input to the development process.</p><p>There is a common belief that service companies can't grow
(or, to use last year's word, <span   class="emphasis"><em>scale</em></span>) as
fast&mdash;or as large&mdash;as product companies. This may not be a bad
thing in any case, but Zelerate is now named to test the
theory.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1851580.0x1942570"></a>Erratum--</h2></div></div><p>The references to IMAP in Mark Stacey's article, &ldquo;Linux as a

software engineering jobs in demand, particularly here in the
Valley. This month proves that it was no fluke. There is still a
continuing demand for both IT skills in general and software
engineering in particular. However, it does look like it is
leveling off. The demand now for software engineers appears to be
increasing at the same rate as for all IT positions. (Note: Chart
#1 is normalized for the number of jobs in January of this year.
That is, the number of openings in January 2000 has been taken as
1.00.)</p><p>

Language Demand Trends
</p></div></div>
</p><p>The demand for all the major computer languages have shown an
interesting set of trends since the start of this year. Chart #2
shows the demand for today's most popular computer languages. The
demand peaked in the April-May time frame when demand overall for
language skills was at its highest. Since then, demand for language
skills has decline until last month when things turned around.
Demand for the Internet-related languages, XML and Perl have
increased while the demand for Java and C/C++ has leveled off. My
conclusion is that the desire to connect systems together using
shared data definitions and universal scripting languages like Perl
is driving this demand. Visual Basic is the anomaly. Demand for it
increased, probably because of new prototyping being done.</p><p>
