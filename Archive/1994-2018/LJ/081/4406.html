    Learn how to implement middleware into the mod_perl/Apache
    design mix.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261b608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Several months ago, we took a long look
at Mason, a Web development environment that combines mod_perl,
Apache and templates. One of the examples was that of a system for
press releases, in which Mason components retrieve the latest press
releases from a database. The style of programming demonstrated in
this article could be characterized as &ldquo;two-tier&rdquo;, in which the
Mason components speak directly with a database, using Perl's DBI
mod_perl's Apache::DBI.
</p><p>But as several people on the Mason e-mail list noted, this
approach&mdash;in which the SQL statements are directly inside of Mason
components&mdash;is often unwise. Modifying the database definitions, or
even the brand of database server we use, forces us to change the
components themselves. In addition, non-web programs must
re-implement SQL calls within their own programs, rather than
reusing a commonly maintained and tested library.</p><p>We can solve both of these problems by adding an extra layer
of software, sometimes known as &ldquo;middleware&rdquo;, between the
database and the Mason components. This increasingly popular
architecture is known as a &ldquo;three-tiered&rdquo; approach, because it
means that we must work with three different sets of software
services: the database, a &ldquo;middleware&rdquo; abstraction layer, and the
implementation/presentation layer.</p><p>This month and next, we will look at a simple web-based
address book and appointment calendar that demonstrate this
three-tier approach. Along the way, I hope that you'll learn the
advantages and disadvantages of this approach and be able to weigh
it alongside other approaches when creating a web site. Once we
have looked into this general architecture, we will be well
prepared to look into Java Server Pages with Jakarta-Tomcat, and
application servers. We'll examine the pitfalls involved with this
approach, as well as how it can make development easier and more
scalable in the long run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261b818"></a>The Database</h2></div></div><p>The first tier, and perhaps the most significant, is the
relational database. I will use PostgreSQL for this example, but it
would not matter much if we used something like Oracle or
MySQL.</p><p>Before we design our database, we must have a specification
describing what we want to do. After all, the design of a database
depends in no small part on how we intend to use it.</p><p>For the purposes of this article, we will keep the
specification relatively short and ambiguous: I want to have an
addressbook that I can view, search and update via the Web. In
addition, I would like to be able to add, view and modify
appointments using my web browser.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we will need at least two
tables, one containing people and the other containing
appointments. Here is an initial stab at a definition of the people
table (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4406l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Defining the People
Table</a></p><p>In other words, we will always store a person's first name,
last name, country and e-mail address. Beyond that, we can store
their address, city, state, postal code and some comments about
them. This assumes that everyone we know has an e-mail address&mdash;an
assumption that is increasingly true, but not necessarily a good
attribute if you have friends and business contacts from outside of
the computer industry.</p><p>Each of the entries in our people table will be uniquely
identified by the person_id column, which is automatically
incremented by PostgreSQL. In addition, we ensure that we only add
each person once by checking for the uniqueness of their e-mail
address. This allows us to have more than one friend named John
Smith. It also means that we cannot store separate information
about a couple with a shared e-mail address. There also is no good
provision for handling people with multiple e-mail
addresses.</p><p>Adding a new person into the people table is relatively
easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People
        (first_name, last_name, address1, address2, email,
        city, state, postal_code, country, comments)
    VALUES
        ('Shai', 'Re\'em', '10
Helmonit', 'Apt. 7',
        'shai@lerner.co.il',
'Modi\'in', NULL,
        71700, 'Israel', 'Six-year-old
nephew')
    ;
</pre><p>Because most of the columns are NULL, I can even get away
with entering a bare minimum of columns:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People
        (first_name, last_name, email, country)
VALUES
        ('Hadar', 'Re\'em',
'hadar@lerner.co.il',
        'Israel')
    ;
</pre>


Now we will create an appointments table in which we will store
appointments with members of the people table:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Appointments (
     person_id    INT4       NOT NULL   REFERENCES People,
     start_time   TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,
     end_time     TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,
     notes        TEXT       NULL       CHECK
                (notes &lt;&gt;''),
        UNIQUE(start_time)
    );
</pre>


Once I have the appointments table defined, I can add a new
appointment by inserting a new row into appointments:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Appointments
        (person_id, start_time, end_time, notes)
    VALUES
        (1, 'November 22, 2000 19:00',
        'November 22, 2000 19:30', 'Read Dr. Seuss')
    ;
</pre>


But because person_id is defined so as to be a foreign key from
people, we can only add an appointment if we are meeting with
someone already in the people table. This might be adequate for our
purposes, but a more sophisticated (and well-specified) system
would presumably give us more flexibility. And of course, this
database will not let me indicate that I am meeting with more than
one person at a time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261bd98"></a>Middleware</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created our initial database design, we will
consider the design of our middleware layer, which insulates the
web application from the database. If we ever decide to switch to
another brand of database server, or even replace the database with
flat ASCII files or DBM files, the object layer will remain the
same.</p><p>In addition, non-web applications will be able to use this
layer in order to access the database, making it possible, for
instance, to write a set of routines that export our appointment
calendar into XML, or to import it from another program.</p><p>This middle tier is often called the &ldquo;business logic&rdquo; of an
application. The database makes it easy and safe for us to store
and retrieve information, and the Mason components make it easy for
us to create dynamic output for the end user. The middleware layer
will try to force the database to do as much of the computation as
possible, using built-in functions, views and stored procedures.
But the actual logic that determines our application's
functionality will reside in the middle tier.</p><p>Perl gives us at least two options when creating this layer.
One possibility is to create a basic Perl module that provides
subroutines and variables that can accomplish the tasks we need.
Such a procedural interface is relatively easy to write and
executes at the same speed as all other Perl subroutines.</p><p>But Perl also offers us the option of creating an object
module. While Perl objects are slightly harder to write, and their
methods execute more slowly than straight subroutines, they make it
easier to conceptualize and write programs.</p><p>Before we can create our middleware layer, we have to answer
some serious questions. What sorts of objects will we create? We
could create a single database object that handles all of our
queries for us, turning them into the appropriate SQL. But we will
occasionally want to retrieve information about people without any
regard for appointments, which means that we should have, if
nothing else, a people object, as well as a separate appointments
object. Because our database table definition forces us to
associate each appointment with one person, we can only define our
appointments object after the people object.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261c058"></a>People.pm</h2></div></div><p>Listing 2 contains a listing for People.pm, an object module
that performs some basic tasks for the people table that we created
earlier. The object is not complete and has some rough edges, but
should suffice for demonstrating how to access a relational
database via an object middleware layer.</p><p><a href="4406l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. People.pm, a Perl Object
Module That Communicates with the Package People</a></p><p>The basic idea is that you create a new instance of people,
and then manipulate the people in your appointment book with that
object. To retrieve all of the names of people in the database, you
can use the get_all_full_names method, as in this code fragment
(also see Listing 3):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use People;
# Create a People object
my $people = new People;
# Retrieve all of the full names
my @names = $people-&gt;get_all_full_names();
# Print the names
foreach my $name (@names)
{
    print "name\n";
}
</pre><p><a href="4406l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Retrieve-people.pl, a
Program That Uses People.pm to Retrieve Information from the
Database</a></p><p>To set or retrieve information about a particular person, you
must first identify which person you're talking about. Because our
middleware layer is meant to shield the user from having to think
or worry about primary keys and other database-specific IDs, we
will allow them to set the &ldquo;current person&rdquo; via either the first
and last name, or via the e-mail address.</p><p>The e-mail address is guaranteed to be unique in the database
layer, and thus using set_current_person_by_email is the most
reliable method available. Nevertheless, it's often useful to
identify people by first and last name, so we also offer the
set_current_person_by_name method. In the current implementation,
using the name to set the current person will match the first
returned row from the database, which might not necessarily be what
you want.</p><p>Once a program has set the current person, it can retrieve
information about that person using the get_current_info
method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Set the current person by name
$people-&gt;set_current_person_by_name("Shai","Re'em")
|| die "Error retrieving person.";
# Print the information
foreach my $key (sort keys %{$info})
{
        if (defined $info-&gt;{$key})
        {
                print "$key =&gt; $info-&gt;{$key}\n";
        }
}
</pre><p>Each instance of people will keep only two pieces of state:
the ID of the currently selected person
($self-&gt;{current_person}) and the database handle ($dbh) that
connects us to the database ($self-&gt;{dbh}). We keep the database
handle around because connecting to a database is a relatively
expensive operation. We can thus save ourselves some time by
connecting to the database in the constructor, and then using that
connection each time we invoke a method on this object.
</p><p>Of course, this means that the database connection will have
to be destroyed when the Perl object goes away&mdash;a somewhat tricky
task, given that Perl does not have explicit destructors, since it
is a garbage-collected language. The solution is to create a method
called DESTROY, which is invoked by Perl whenever the object is
destroyed. Our DESTROY method merely closes our connection to the
database, allowing the object to be removed without potentially
causing a memory leak in either the database client or
server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub DESTROY
{
        # Get myself
        my $self = shift;
        # Get the database handle
        my $dbh = $self-&gt;{dbh};
        # Close the database handle
        $dbh-&gt;disconnect;
        return;
}
</pre><p>We can even create a new person, invoking the new_person
method with a set of hash keys and values as arguments. These are
then translated by the middleware layer into an appropriate SQL
query:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Now insert a new person
my $success = $people-&gt;new_person
        (first_name =&gt; "Reuven",
        last_name =&gt; "Lerner",
        country =&gt; "Israel"
        email =&gt; 'reuven@lerner.co.il',
        phone =&gt; '08-973-2225');
print "Inserted successfully" if $success;
</pre>


Because Perl's undefined (&ldquo;undef&rdquo;) value is automatically
translated into an SQL &ldquo;NULL&rdquo; value, the optional columns will be
filled in with NULLs, as should be the case.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261c688"></a>Appointments</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a class that handles the people in our
database, we need to create an appointments class. For now, we will
only concern ourselves with inserting new appointments and
retrieving today's appointments.</p><p>The design of Appointments.pm (see Listing 4) is generally
similar to People.pm, particularly in the way that it opens a
database connection in the constructor and closes it in the
automatically invoked DESTROY method. Beyond this, however,
appointments keeps no state whatsoever. It merely acts as a conduit
to the database, allowing us to create new appointments and find
out with whom we are meeting today.</p><p><a href="4406l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
Appointments.p</a></p><p>For example, Listing 5 contains a short program that uses
Appointments.pm to create a new appointment. We must create an
instance of people and another of appointments. Once we have these
two objects, we can set the &ldquo;current person&rdquo; to be my niece
(&ldquo;Hadar Re'em&rdquo;), dying with an error if
set_current_person_by_name returns undef (indicating
failure).</p><p><a href="4406l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.
Insert-appointment.pl</a></p><p>Once we have successfully set the current person, we can
create an appointment with that person. The format of the date and
time are dictated by PostgreSQL, which accepts a variety of
formats.</p><p>We can similarly retrieve today's appointments using the
program in Listing 6 (print-appointments.pl). This program uses the
get_today method, which returns a list of hash references. Note
that the implementation of get_today uses DBI's fetchrow_hashref
method, which is known to be significantly slower than
fetchrow_arrayref. However, it makes life much more convenient,
allowing us to do print-appointments as seen in Listing 6.</p><p><a href="4406l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.
Print-appointments.pl</a></p><p>Finally, we can list all of today's appointments with a
particular person with the get_today_with_person method. Of course,
this means that we must create an instance of people and choose a
current person using one of the methods described earlier. The
implementation of get_today_with_person expects to receive an
instance of people as its first user-passed parameter, allowing us
to use the current person in our SQL query. The program in Listing
7 demonstrates how I can find all of today's appointments that I
have with my nephew Shai.</p><p><a href="4406l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7.
Print-appointments-with-shai.pl</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x261cc08"></a>Designing the Objects</h2></div></div><p>One of the major points of using objects in a middleware
layer is the fact that they provide a layer of abstraction. So long
as the interface is well defined and remains stable, the
implementation can change.</p><p>However, as with all programming techniques, designing good
objects can be difficult. Perl provides totally open access to an
object's internals, meaning that without a good API, programmers
using the object might be tempted to reach inside and work directly
with the implementation. This might mean that software will break
when the implementation changes&mdash;the very situation that using
objects was supposed to prevent!</p><p>In addition, we want our objects' implementations to be
relatively separate from each other. During my design of the people
and appointments objects, I was sorely tempted to allow
Appointments to get and use the numeric ID of the current person.
But of course, doing so would violate the abstraction barrier that
I created with my object. The solution, which is admittedly not as
elegant as I would like, was to create the get_current_person
method. This allows appointments to retrieve the current user,
without having to know where it comes from. In the end, of course,
the return value from get_current_person is placed in an SQL
statement and is compared with People.person_id, breaking the
abstraction somewhat.</p><p>Finally, notice how each of the objects here contains basic
logic, but does not store any state. It would be relatively simple,
for example, for our people object to retrieve all of the rows from
the people table, and to make them available to invoking objects
from within Perl. Indeed, such a solution would significantly
reduce the overhead of going to a database, and would allow us to
perform manipulations in Perl, rather than turning to SQL each
time.</p><p>But this solution causes many more problems than it solves.
For example, what happens if we create two instances of people? Now
we have two objects, each of which contains the full set of rows
from the people table. If one object modifies its state, that
modification will never be reflected in the second object. Worse
yet, what happens if both objects modify their state before storing
those changes in the database? Perhaps the database is designed to
resolve such locking issues, but our Perl objects are not.
Furthermore, what happens when we have 100,000 people in our people
table? Reading that much data into a database client is a waste of
memory, and of the high-performance data selection and manipulation
routines that a database server includes.</p><p>Our objects are thus pipelines to the database, giving our
web application the ability to talk to a database without having to
include any SQL or knowledge of the tables' layout. The objects, by
providing a standard API, make it possible to change the underlying
implementation without having to announce those changes to the
world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2523580.0x2a15118"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This month, we looked at the reasons behind three-tiered
architectures and started to look into a basic implementation of an
application that uses this architecture. As you can see, we can
already create small text-mode applications. Next month, we will
complete our implementation, giving us the skeleton for a simple
appointment book using mod_perl/Mason and PostgreSQL. We will also
discuss issues regarding the scalability of three-tier solutions,
as well as some of the pitfalls.</p><p><a href="4406s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
