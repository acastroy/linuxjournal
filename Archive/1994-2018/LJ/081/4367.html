    FIASCO provides state-of-the-art image and video compression.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c1d558"></a></h2></div></div><p>A picture is worth a thousand words&mdash;a
frequently used sentence to introduce the need for digital image
processing. And indeed, a wide variety of aspects in our life is
influenced by digital images in the meantime. For instance, in the
World Wide Web not only still pictures but also small video
sequences are used to enhance the design of web pages. However, the
usage of digital images has a major drawback. An enormous amount of
data has to be transmitted and stored each time an image or video
is requested.
</p><p>For example, a single uncompressed frame of a high definition
television (HDTV) screen (resolution of 1280x720 pixels, 24 bits
per pixel) requires more than 2MB memory. When assuming a display
rate of 60 frames per second (HDTV), one second of a video movie
already requires more than 165MB, summing up to a total of 2,000
compact discs for a movie of 120 minutes! Clearly, downloading such
an uncompressed video stream is impossible, even though fast
Internet connections like asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)
are getting more popular now.</p><p>So image and video compression systems&mdash;like FIASCO, the
fractal image and video codec&mdash;are mandatory in handling such
enormous amount of data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c1d710"></a>Image and Video Compression</h2></div></div><p>Different solutions are applicable to compress image data:
for instance, the resolution of the frames can be reduced as well
as the frame rate. However, this reduction is not sufficient. In
general, image sequences typically contain three different types of
redundancy that can be exploited (see Resources):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>spatial redundancy, which is due to the correlation
between neighboring pixels</p></li><li><p>spectral redundancy, which is due to the
correlation between different color bands (red, green and blue
components)</p></li><li><p>temporal redundancy, which is due to the
correlation between subsequent video frames</p></li></ul></div><p>The goal of any image compression system is to recognize and
remove these redundancies. The following two compression approaches
are widely used:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>lossless, or reversible: the decoded image is
numerically identical to the original image (the file size is
typically reduced by 50%); this is useful if the image is
computationally processed any further</p></li><li><p>the decoded image contains more or less artifacts
(file size less than 10% of the original amount of data); this is
useful in low bit-rate applications like the World Wide Web</p></li></ul></div>

Hence, lossy compression is mandatory for very low bit-rate
Internet video applications (16-64KBps). Several lossy image and
video coding standards have emerged in the last ten years, e.g.,
JPEG, MPEG and H.263. Most of these standards got a face-lift to
incorporate the results of the current research in this area, e.g.,
JPEG2000, MPEG-4 and H.263+ (see Resources). Moreover, a lot of new
algorithms have been investigated that have not found a way into a
standard, although they are quite appealing. Wavelet-based image
coders currently define the state-of-the-art in image coding.
However, these codecs still suffer from a slow runtime of the
decoder, making real-time (software-based) video decoding nearly
impossible. Additionally, most of these new methods are covered by
patents and proprietary formats, prohibiting open-source solutions.

a replacement for JPEG and MPEG for very low bit rates (see
Resources). It provides the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>state-of-the-art image and video compression
(combined in one application)</p></li><li><p>real-time software-based decoding</p></li><li><p>open-source implementation</p></li></ul></div><p>FIASCO compressed images are typically much smaller than JPEG
files (at low bit rates), while the image quality is still
acceptable. For example, see Figure 1 where you see images
compressed by JPEG and FIASCO (1:220 in Figure 1A and 1B and 1:100
in Figure 1C and 1D compression ratio, i.e., 0.5% and 1%
respectively, of the original file size).

Compression</h2></div></div><p>The coding method of FIASCO is basically a straightforward
generalization of the JPEG method. The JPEG algorithm subdivides an
image into a set of image blocks of 8x8 pixels. Each of these
blocks is then independently encoded by a linear combination of 64
basis images (the cosine basis, see Resources for details) as shown
in Figure 2. The coefficients of these block approximations are
then quantized and stored in the output file.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4367f2.large.jpg"><img src="4367f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. JPEG Compression Algorithm
</p></div></div><p>In Figure 2 the image is subdivided into 8x8 pixel blocks.
Each of them is approximated by a linear combination of the cosine
basis. The approximation coefficients (a and b in the figure) are
then quantized and stored in the JPEG file. FIASCO extends this
concept in the following ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The image is adaptively subdivided into subblocks
(squares or rectangles) of different size. Smaller blocks than
those used in smooth regions are used in difficult areas.</p></li><li><p>Each image block is approximated by image blocks of
a dynamic dictionary. The dictionary not only contains a fixed set
of basis images (e.g., the well-known JPEG cosine images) but also
all previously encoded image blocks. This method is related to text
compression algorithms, which also use dynamically generated
dictionaries (e.g., LZW compression).</p></li><li><p>When coding videos, only the difference between
subsequent frames is encoded by hierarchical motion
compensation.</p></li></ol></div><p>FIASCO exploits self-similarities within single pictures, and
also sequences of pictures, to remove spatial, spectral and
temporal redundancies, making it a typical fractal coding method.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c155a0"></a>FIASCO Source Package</h2></div></div><p>The FIASCO package is released under the terms of the GNU
General Public License and is built up of command line applications
and a library to compress, decode and visualize images and videos.
You just have to run the typical GNU build process
(<b  >./configure;make;make install</b>) to compile and
install the FIASCO package. FIASCO is entirely written in ANSI C
and should compile on most UNIX platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c15700"></a>Command Line Applications</h2></div></div><p>Usage of the commandline FIASCO coder and decoder is similar
to the <b  >cjpeg</b> and <b  >djpeg</b>
applications of the IJPEG package (Independent JPEG group), which
should be part of every Linux distribution.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cfiasco --quality=10 --output=video.fco frame0*.ppm
</pre><p>The above encodes the given video files (in raw PNM format)
with quality ten, writing a single FIASCO file
<b  >video.fco</b>. Please note that you cannot compare
the quality settings of FIASCO with JPEG. The typical quality range
of FIASCO is 1-100, which corresponds to a JPEG quality less than
five. FIASCO is intended for very low bit rates only; i.e., you
cannot compute compressed images that correspond to a JPEG quality
of 75.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dfiasco</b></span>, the FIASCO decoder,
is also used like djpeg:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dfiasco --output=image.ppm image.fco
</pre><p>This decodes the given FIASCO file and writes a new image in
PNM format. But <b  >dfiasco</b> also contains a display
module to show video frames in an X11 window. Currently, only an
Xlib-based window with the typical set of control buttons is
available (play, stop, forward, etc.). Hopefully, this simple
decoder and the FIASCO library provides a good starting point for
developers to support the FIASCO format in their favorite image and
video programs (Mozilla, GIMP, etc.). Please visit the home page of
FIASCO to get some compressed images and videos (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c15b78"></a>Compression Library</h2></div></div><p>The coding and decoding functionality of FIASCO is available
in a shared library. Data type definitions and function prototypes
are provided by the include file <b  >fiasco.h</b>, which
is installed in the <b  >$prefix/include</b>
directory.</p><p>You can simply compress images or videos in your application
by a function call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fiasco_coder (image_names, fiasco_name, quality, NULL)
</pre><p>This call compresses the image file(s) given by the array
<b  >image_names</b> with the predefined approximation
<b  >quality</b> (1.0-100.0) and creates the new FIASCO
output file <b  >fiasco_name</b>. Several advanced
compression parameters can be adjusted by using an optional
parameter object which I don't describe here, see the FIASCO manual
pages for details.
</p><p>In order to decode a FIASCO file in your application, you
have to instantiate an object of the decoder class
<b  >fiasco_decoder_t</b> with a call of the constructor
function <b  >fiasco_decoder_new (fiasco_name, NULL)</b>.
<b  >fiasco_name</b> specifies the file to decode whereas
the second parameter is an optional parameter object to adjust the
behavior of the decoder.</p><p>Individual frames are then decoded by subsequent calls of the
method <b  >fiasco_decoder_get_frame</b>. These frames
are returned in an internal FIASCO format, which then can be
rendered in different ways to fit the needs of your application.
For more information about the compression library, refer to the
manual pages shipped with FIASCO.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b25580.0x1c16150"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>FIASCO provides a powerful compression library that is
intended to replace JPEG and MPEG for low bit-rate applications.
FIASCO is an asymmetric compression method; you get software-based,
real-time decoding at the cost of slow encoding times. FIASCO is
especially suited in an application context where images or videos
are compressed only once but requested and decoded several times
(e.g., world wide web applications). Finally, if FIASCO were to be
combined with an open-source sound and speech compression (e.g.
Vorbis, see Resources), a complete video compression system for low
bit rates would be available for free.</p><p><a href="4367s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p>@aa:Ullrich Hafner (hafner@bigfoot.de,
