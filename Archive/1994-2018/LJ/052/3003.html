    Mr. Nelson gives his opinions on how a business can
    subscribe to the Open Source philosophy and still make
    money.

these days. Big companies and small companies alike are either
releasing their software as Open Source or considering it. On the
forefront of their minds is &ldquo;Yes, it's more reliable; yes, it
meets more users' needs. But how do we make money on it?&rdquo;
</p><p>First, we must be clear that no industry is sacrosanct in any
economy. Almost all companies rely on special protection from the
government, called intellectual property rights. These rights,
covering both copyright and patent laws, exist because they are
thought to be economically efficient&mdash;that is, they create more
than they destroy. Should that prove wrong&mdash;that protecting
computer software as intellectual property actually makes society
poorer&mdash;then the computer industry will just have to rely solely on
contract law. If society is better off with all software as Open
Source, then that is how it will be, even if it makes computer
programmers worse off financially.</p><p>Open Source software need not impoverish all
programmers&mdash;indeed, there is good evidence that the deleterious
effects of switching to all Open Source software would be only
short term. Remember the Luddites? The dislocations in the weaving
industry were only temporary. Forty years later, the industry was
employing just as many weavers and, of course, weaving a greater
amount of cloth.</p><p>If you want to see this model in action, look through this
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. You'll see ad after
ad, most of them for Open Source software. The way to make money in
a free market is to solve someone's problem and take a cut of the
benefit they receive. There are many different ways to do so, as
reading the ads proves.</p><p>Second, I have been assuming that Open Source software is
applicable to all types of software. This is not clearly true or
false. What is definitely true is that an operating system can be
Open Source and be successful, as all the readers of this magazine
know. Perhaps other types of software are not as amenable to Open
Source distribution. If this is the case, then the creators of such
Open Source software will either not exist in the first place or
will go out of business. For this type of software, the proprietary
model would work best.</p><p>People have gotten rich from Open Source software, and still
are. As long as you have an industry where people can get rich,
you've got plenty of incentive to enter the industry.</p><p>The big question being discussed on the Free Software
Business mailing list (fsb-subscribe@crynwr.com) is: &ldquo;How do you
create a piece of software which requires a large up-front
investment of human energy?&rdquo;</p><p>Companies such as Netscape or Corel can easily afford to free
a major piece of code. The software has been proprietary for a
number of years and has recouped its initial investment. The Crynwr
Packet Driver Collection started small and was initially useful
with only one driver in it, so it doesn't fit the open model. The
first released version of Linux was a real UNIX kernel with a file
system and serial port drivers. To the extent that it needed an
up-front investment, Linus has been paid back for it.</p><p>No, recovering the investment is a tough job without
intellectual property laws. Problem is, they're needed precisely
for only those tough jobs. More than any other type of intellectual
property, creation of most computer software involves very little
capital costs. Invoking the coercion of the state (even as far as
stealing a person's thoughts, when independent creation occurs) is
less and less appropriate. Software creation is cheaper now than
when PCs were new. The areas where Open Software cannot succeed
seem smaller and smaller.</p></div></div>

      <span   class="bold"><b>Russell Nelson</b></span>
      has been developing Open
      Source software long before the term existed. His first freed
      software, Freemacs, came out 15 years ago. He was the progenitor of
      the Clarkson Packet Driver Collection, the first freed software to
      be recognized by <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span>'s Technical Excellence
      awards. Currently, he works for Crynwr Software, founded in 1991,
      an Open Source support firm. He can be reached at
