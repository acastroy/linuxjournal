normally tranquil Duke University Campus was transformed into a
raucous playground for geeks and hackers as the Fourth Annual Linux
Expo was held at Duke's Bryan Center.
</p><p>By all accounts, this year's Expo was a smashing success. Red
Hat's Marketing Director, Lisa Sullivan, deserves special thanks
for organizing and directing the event. Many others, from Key Note
Speaker Linus Torvalds to the blue-shirted Duke University catering
staff, were instrumental in making it a memorable three
days.</p><p>According to Sullivan, approximately 1500 visitors were
registered as paid attendees, while another 350 to 500 were
registered as speakers, VIPs or other gratis attendees. Attendees
ranged from as far away as Korea, Finland, Colombia and Alaska.
Some 34 exhibitors showed their products and services.</p><p>The speakers included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Eric S. Raymond gave an inspired, scholarly
overview of hacker motivation in his &ldquo;Homesteading the Noosphere&rdquo;
speech.</p></li><li><p>Miguel de Icaza, despite troubles with the overhead
projector, shared much about the technical details and future
features of &ldquo;GNOME, The GNU Network Object Model Environment&rdquo;
GUI.</p></li><li><p>Mark Mathews described his success as a consultant
and Linux programmer in his talk, &ldquo;Developing Linux Software for
Fun&mdash;Turns into Profit&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall described his encounters with
Linux users worldwide during &ldquo;Linux Around the World&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div><p>The exhibitors included:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Corel Computer Corporation displayed their new
Linux-based NetWinder Network Computer.</p></li><li><p>Digital Equipment Corporation exhibited their
latest generation Alpha processors.</p></li><li><p>Linux Hardware Solutions showed off some of their
line of, well, Linux hardware solutions.</p></li><li><p>Caldera, Red Hat and Turbo Linux were there
presenting their latest Linux distributions.</p></li></ul></div>

Of course, the single most popular event was Friday evening's
keynote address by Linus Torvalds. An estimated 1000 to 1200 folks
were on hand. In his typically unpretentious, casual and brutally
honest style, Linus filled us in on his future vision for the Linux
kernel. Linus first took a moment to thank everyone who has helped
him with the stable kernel releases, especially Alan Cox. Linus
went on to say he is happy with the way Linux is going, especially
with the way new markets are opening up and new applications are
being made available.
</p><p>Here are some highlights of Linus's views on important topics
for the future of the Linux Kernel:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The 2.2 release: look for a code freeze in about a
month with the next stable release, Kernel 2.2, to follow as soon
as late July or early August.</p></li><li><p>SMP: Symmetrical Multi-Processing is currently one
of Linus's favorite features of the kernel; expect continued
development and enhancement of SMP in future releases.</p></li><li><p>Merced: Linus is not particularly impressed with or
concerned about Intel's upcoming 64-bit processor, code-named
Merced&mdash;he actually prefers DEC's Alpha architecture. He did say
porting Linux to Merced should be no problem once GCC is optimized
for Merced.</p></li><li><p>Java: While Linus would like to see an officially
supported Java Development Kit from Sun, he is still not impressed
with Java and would prefer to stay out of the Microsoft/Sun clash
over Java purity.</p></li><li><p>Emulation: Linus would prefer to see native Linux
applications and does not like the idea of emulating other
operating systems for the purpose of running applications.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, Linus had much more to say, but the gist of his
speech was that with more time and some more good luck, Linux will
continue to move towards complete world domination. Judging from
the air of excitement and the buzz of optimism pervading this
year's Linux Expo, Linus is exactly right.
