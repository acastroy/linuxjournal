It has
nothing to do with colour coordination or disagreements over
wallpaper design. It has everything to do with the fact that almost
every square inch of available floor space is given over to the
storage of outdated and mostly unused computer equipment. I have
everything from an Apple LaserWriter-I to CP/M laptops to a
complete 486 tower system stacked in there. Does this sound
familiar to anyone?</p><p>While that particular 486 tower is too noisy for home use,
another 486 system, a desktop Compaq Prolinea 4/33, is one of my
favourite workhorses. Originally consigned to the corporate junk
heap, I rescued it, swapped the old 127MB disk for a more modern
2.1GB model, installed Linux and then configured it to be the main
NFS/Samba server on my home network. In addition to that task, I
use it as an xhost server for a Sun IPC (the IPC has a much nicer
keyboard and a higher definition display than the Compaq), as a
PLIP server for a 386 laptop and also as a compile engine for all
of the other 386 class machines in my motley stable. However, while
the hour or so required for a kernel compile is much better than
the overnight wait required for an i386 machine to complete the
same task, it is still fairly tedious, especially when working on
experimental changes, so for some time now I've been on the lookout
for a viable upgrade.</p><p>Unfortunately, bringing yet another system into the house
doesn't pass the good housekeeping test. (Besides which, I don't
have the cash available for a new system and Pentium Pro machines
haven't yet started to appear on the company junk heap.) While a
motherboard upgrade looked promising initially, the unique internal
layout of the Prolinea, specifically the orientation of the ISA
expansion slots, would have meant having to buy a chassis as well
as the motherboard. Add the cost of that to my wife's
understandable reluctance to allow anything resembling yet another
computer into the house, and the obvious answer was to opt for an
upgrade processor instead.</p><p>A quick check of the local shops here in rural Japan proved
disappointing, with a dearth of 486 upgrade options. A couple of
shops did carry the standard Intel Over-Drive kit, but at a truly
extortionist price. As it happened though, I had recently received
a catalogue from a U.S. mail-order house and a check showed 486 to
586/133MHz upgrades at a very attractive price&mdash;only $109.95 for a
kit, with the added promise of a much greater performance increase
than the Intel version. Was it too good to be true? Well, there was
only one way to find out, and at that price I wasn't going to be
too much out of pocket even if it turned out to be a complete
lemon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c06580.0x1cfec38"></a>The Kit</h2></div></div><p>The Evergreen 486 upgrade kit comes in a fairly bulky box,
with most of the volume being taken up by pre-formed packing
designed to prevent damage to the pins on the upgrade processor.
The kit contains the processor assembly, a chip removal tool, a
diskette containing a diagnostic program, an instruction manual and
a $10 refund voucher (which, in my case, had expired one week
before I actually received the kit).</p><p>The processor assembly consists of a plastic, flat-pack chip
mounted on a small PCB with three configuration jumpers to one
side. The chip has a heat-sink and fan assembly already attached.
There are no external power connections for the fan (operating
power being drawn through the socket). The CPU is a 133MHz 5x86
processor from AMD with 16KB of internal cache. The clock speed
multiplier is jumper selectable, making the processor a drop-in
replacement for 25, 33, 40, 50, 66 or 80MHz 486SX or 486DX chips.
The other two jumpers are used to select over-drive or main
processor socket placement and the cache mode.</p><p>The instruction manual is straightforward, with clear
illustrations of the various socket configurations which a typical
user might encounter. The jumper settings are well explained, with
the notable exception of the cache configuration jumper (more on
this later). It also contains lots of sound, common-sense advice,
such as marking the orientation of pin-1 of your original processor
on the mother board <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> removing it from
the socket. (Many motherboards have the silk-screen markings
obscured by other components.) In addition, some 22 of a total of
72 pages are dedicated to a fairly comprehensive troubleshooting
guide. On the down side (and pretty much as you'd expect), it
doesn't contain any mention of operating systems other than DOS or
Windows.</p><p>This extends to the diagnostic diskette, too. The diagnostic
program, <span   class="bold"><b>etdiag</b></span>, will run only
under DOS and, because it is designed to measure system
performance, it cannot be run under DOSEMU in Linux. This can be
something of a problem in a Microsoft-free zone, but I did discover
that etdiag would run under at least two versions of DOS which are
readily available from the Internet: one a completely free version
and the other a cut-down, evaluation version of a commercial
product&mdash;refer to the resources sidebar for URLs. One of the neat
things about etdiag is that it will recommend a specific upgrade
processor model, based on what it discovers about your system
during the initial test, and because Evergreen makes the diagnostic
available from their web site, you can use this facility before
buying an upgrade kit.</p><p>The actual chip replacement process shouldn't cause anyone
too much trouble. The chip removal tool supplied with the kit is
somewhat thicker than ones I've encountered previously, but with a
little bit of patience and minimal effort I was able to ease my
original processor out of its socket and replace it with the
Evergreen unit. I checked to make sure the fan was turning and the
system had completed its power-on self test successfully before
replacing the system top cover.</p><p>Booting the diagnostic again confirmed the new chip type,
higher internal clock speed and increased cache memory were
identified correctly. The Dhrystone rating for the CPU (measured
under etdiag) had also jumped from the original value of 15384 to a
very respectable 39370, increase in performance of two and a half
times. Booting Linux showed a BogoMIPs rating increase of exactly
four, from 16.59 with the original 33MHz 486 chip, to 66.36 for the
133MHz 586 chip, which is pretty much what you'd expect with a
quadrupled clock.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c06580.0x1cfefa8"></a>Running Linux</h2></div></div><p>While overall performance is very subjective (few of us use
exactly the same mix of tools and applications), I have to say
that, for me, the upgrade was a huge improvement. The machine felt
completely different with applications starting and running faster
and boot-up and shut-down times greatly reduced.</p><p>A kernel compile ran almost exactly twice as fast, with the
upgraded machine completing a <b  >make clean; make
zImage</b> in 31:36.66 seconds, a task which the original 486
processor completed in an elapsed time (measured using
/usr/bin/time) of 1:00:30.24 (slightly over one hour). Given that
the rest of the system (main memory and the I/O subsystem) was
unchanged, this is quite a respectable increase in performance.
Perhaps the biggest perceived change was to the performance of
xhosted applications. Netscape, always a CPU and memory hog,
started up much faster, as did xterms, a clock and the other
applications which I normally run. X performance on the system also
improved, but with the current, low resolution monitor and standard
VGA video card, I don't envisage using it as a true desktop machine
very much (perhaps that's the next upgrade target area). Network
(NFS/Samba) performance seemed pretty much unchanged.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c06580.0x1cff160"></a>The Down Side</h2></div></div><p>There isn't one. Nothing needs to be recompiled or changed in
any way. There are no reliability issues. The fan on the Evergreen
unit is completely inaudible when the covers are on the
system.</p><p>The only fault I have with the whole kit is that mysterious
cache configuration jumper. It is clearly shown in the
illustrations, but ignored in the body of the text. The appendix
contains a brief explanation of the differences between
write-through and write-back cache. The kit comes with the jumper
pre-set to a default of write-through and while it is unlikely
anyone could get into trouble using this setting, a simple comment,
even if only &ldquo;leave well alone&rdquo;, would have been better than
nothing at all.</p><p>This lack of information on the cache configuration setting
led to my trying out Evergreen's technical support by e-mail. They
responded to my question within 48 hours, to let me know that the
write-back cache option will work only with systems which have been
specifically designed with that option in mind. The fact that
Evergreen's tech-support responded within a reasonable time and
that their web site is an easily accessible, round-the-clock source
of information is of no little importance with a product where some
degree of &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; is involved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c06580.0x1cff318"></a>Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>For anyone owning nothing more powerful than a 486 and on a
limited budget, this upgrade path is certainly one which I would
recommend. Overall system performance has been improved with no
decrease in reliability. There were no operating system changes
involved and my existing kernel worked fine.</p><p>With all of this coming at a cost roughly equivalent to
one-tenth of the cheapest, bottom-end system from a mainstream
manufacturer, it has to qualify as perhaps the cheapest, legal way
to get yourself a &ldquo;new&rdquo; machine. Not only that, but your
&ldquo;significant other&rdquo; need never know.</p><p><a href="2640s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
