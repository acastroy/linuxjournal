    The new kid on the
    block&mdash;Stampede Linux.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2937f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1706580.0x17fe4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> Stampede Linux was created because of
our dissatisfaction with other distributions. We found that while
other distributions had many useful features, none of them had
everything we wanted. While the development team recognizes
perfection is an unachievable goal, the driving force behind the
development of Stampede Linux is to create a perfect distribution.
</p><p>The Stampede Linux Project was founded by Matt Wood, who
heads the development team and is the backbone of everything
relating to Stampede. His original intention for Stampede was for
it to be a Pentium-compiled rebuild of Slackware&mdash;a private
distribution for use by himself and a couple of friends. However,
Stampede has grown to be much more; it dropped its Slackware ties
early in the development process.</p><p>Perhaps the most frequent question we're asked during this
development period is: &ldquo;Why another distribution?&rdquo; Several
reasons provide the answer:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>None of the current distributions are optimized for
newer machines. We don't believe Pentium/Pentium Pro/Pentium II/K6
machines should be running code written and optimized for 386 or
486 machines. All of Stampede's binaries and packages are compiled
using the Pentium GCC Compiler.</p></li><li><p>There isn't a distribution centered mainly around
up-to-date and current packages, as well as security. We believe
that having a secure system (in conjunction with updated packages)
is the only way a distribution should be created. Rather than
giving the user the option to install packages to increase
security, Stampede will be as secure as possible, and give the user
the option to install packages to decrease security.</p></li><li><p>Although most distributions are fairly easy to
install, we find that for the new user they aren't easy enough. If
the Linux revolution is going to take place, simpler and more
intuitive installation and configuration programs must be
developed.</p></li></ul></div><p>These reasons have led to the implementation of several key
features. First off, all packages are compiled with the Pentium GCC
Compiler, a variation of the GCC Compiler with optimizations for
Pentium class chips. This is important because PGCC increases
performance of a Pentium-compatible system and usually results in a
10-30% faster system. The Pentium GCC compiler is also fully
compatible with i386+ processors and clones. (Information on PGCC
can be found at http://www.goof.com/pcg/).
</p><p>All Stampede stable binaries are also compiled
<span   class="bold"><b>without</b></span> debugging
(<b  >-g</b>) information, delivering a smaller, faster
binary. We are considering the release of a separate package which
includes debugging information, for those who want it.</p><p>Stampede Linux also uses gnulibc2 (libc6), a much faster
version of the standard C libraries. This version includes a more
stable interface, thread-safe functions, an improved math library,
new functions from POSIX and XPG4.2, and is 64-bit clean. However,
it is still under development and is available only for GNU-based
(both Hurd and Linux) systems. More information on GNU libc can be
found at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html.</p><p>The Stampede Linux Package (SLP) Management system is also
progressing quite nicely. Unlike some other distributions, using
this package is totally optional. If you wish, you can stick with
gzipped tar (or bz2) files and not use the SLP files. However, we
believe that most users will want to use the package format because
of its portability. The development team plans to have automatic
upgrading of packages implemented by version 1.0 of
Stampede.</p><p>Stampede plans on using BSD-like init scripts to configure
all of the system run-level maintenance, but developing these
scripts does not yet have a high priority. Even though these
scripts are easy to configure, we still plan to create a set of
configuration tools which allow a simple, straightforward way of
setting up and changing the init scripts.</p><p>Another feature worth mentioning is the boot/root disks. With
Slackware, finding and downloading the correct boot disk seemed to
annoy almost everyone on the development team. So, we have decided
to create a third disk, a modules disk. Anything that can be
compiled as a module instead of being built into the kernel will go
onto the module disk. This will include CD-ROM, Ethernet and hard
disk drivers. Doing this should make it easier for newcomers to
Linux to find the right boot disk.</p><p>The setup program is also notable. We have designed it in
such a manner that it auto-detects the packages on the source
media, and then asks you which ones to install. This method makes
it much easier for us to add and update packages and package sets,
as well as for the user to create or install their own. There will
also be an option to select from a number of different automated
installs. This will be a big plus for those who are new to Linux,
and also to those who prefer not to answer questions during the
install.</p><p>The development process of Stampede is quite unique. The
Stampede Linux development team consists of people in different
areas of the world who collaborate their efforts over the Internet
by e-mail and IRC. While it does happen that tasks are assigned to
certain individuals, most of the time one of us comes up with an
idea, or gets one from a user or mailing list, and then works on
it. If it gets the official okay from Matt, it goes into the
distribution. Personal preference is a factor in determining which
tools and programs we choose to include in the distribution, but we
try to create and include programs which are easy for the new user,
yet powerful enough for the more advanced.</p><p>During this development stage, we try to maintain a good
balance between functionality and stability. We feel that as long
as a program isn't too buggy or awkward to the user, it is worth
including. We don't stick with software just because it's in other
distributions. We realize that by using programs such as gnulibc2
and PGCC, and our new package format, we are taking a potential
risk that users who have become accustomed to the older software
may run into trouble at this time. However, we believe the
advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages. We also have
confidence in our method because of our plans for SLP. With the
automatic package updating mentioned earlier, there should be no
problems.</p><p>Like other computer programming projects, we have obstacles
we are trying to overcome. One of the main obstacles we face in our
development is that all testing must be done on our own personal
computers. Since at this point we have no money to buy equipment,
it is hard for us to test Stampede on different computers. We need
testers with different equipment. However, we still plan to become
a non-profit organization, dependent on user efforts and donations
to help us further development.</p><p>Odd bugs seem to be giving us a lot of trouble at this time.
Since we can't always tell whether something is going wrong because
we placed it in the incorrect place, compiled it wrong or coded it
badly, it is hard for us to find bugs in the actual software.
Thankfully, this seems to be less and less of a problem as
development progresses and the system becomes more stable as a
whole.</p><p>Any and all ideas given to us are taken into consideration.
If it is worthwhile to the user to have in the distribution, it is
worthwhile for us to include. It's hard to say what we have planned
for future versions, because any new idea we have, we try to
squeeze into version 1.0.</p><p>However, here are some things we hope to see in Stampede's
future:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ports to different architectures: we recently found
someone to help port to SPARC, and we also have members of the
development team who plan to start on a Power PC port.</p></li><li><p>A central system configuration utility: this will
most likely be for the X Window System, written in GTK (which all
our X utilities use). It will include sections to add/remove users
and groups, configure the init scripts and much more.</p></li><li><p>A more automated package update process: as
mentioned earlier, automation is something we strive for, as we
believe this will not only help new users, but will also give
experienced users less worry. We are beginning development of the
Stampede Linux Package Daemon
(<span   class="bold"><b>slpd</b></span>), which will optionally
query a central server at given periods of time and check for
package updates, then download and install them.</p></li></ul></div><p>Development of Stampede Linux is moving ahead at an
incredibly fast pace. We have a very talented team of developers,
and all are devoted to making Stampede Linux the best distribution
available. The creation of Stampede is only 50% coding, because
putting it all together and making sure it all runs smoothly has
proven to be an equally big task. However, we take things one day
at a time and deal with each obstacle as it comes. We aren't in
this for the money or to outdo anyone. We are fully supportive of
the Open Source cause. We simply want what you want&mdash;a distribution
that is fast, stable, secure and robust. It is our goal to prove
that there is always room for improvement.</p></div></div>
