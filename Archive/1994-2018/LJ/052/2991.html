Lerner</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #52, August 1998</div></div><div><p>
    Continuing the discussion of mod_perl, Mr. Lerner tells us
    about the DBI specification and the Apache::DBI module.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20cc500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we started to look at
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, a module for the Apache
web server that puts a copy of Perl inside of our HTTP server. Not
only does mod_perl save us the overhead of forking a new process
and invoking Perl each time a CGI program is run, but it caches
programs once they are compiled, reducing start-up time even
further.
</p><p>As with everything else in life, there are trade-offs for
using mod_perl. CGI programs can be written in any language and can
be run by any web server on any platform. By contrast, mod_perl
only works with Apache (which runs under most UNIX versions and is
about to be released for Win32), and requires that programs be
written in Perl. If you are interested in maximum portability, you
might consider sticking with CGI. But if you are like me and spend
most of your time working with Apache and Perl anyway, you might
seriously consider moving toward mod_perl.</p><p>However, this is not the end of the story. Even if mod_perl
were infinitely faster than CGI's fork-and-execute method, a major
bottleneck would still remain: opening a connection to a database
server.</p><p>If your web application talks to a relational database
server, it has to open a connection before it can send a query.
That initial dialogue between your program and the database server
can take quite a while, both because of the initial TCP connection
that must be established and because database servers were not
designed for single-query connections. Many servers expect you to
connect once, send a number of requests, receive a number of
responses and disconnect when done. Web applications, by contrast,
tend to open a connection for each query, which can unnecessarily
slow your programs.</p><p>Luckily for us, the folks who wrote mod_perl created a module
designed to solve this problem.
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::DBI</b></span>, as it is called,
takes advantage of mod_perl's variable persistence (i.e., the fact
that variable values are kept from one invocation of a program to
another) to keep database connections open. Each invocation of a
program using Apache::DBI has only to send a query to the database
and act on the returned response.</p><p>This month, we look at the DBI specification in general, and
the Apache::DBI module in particular. We also take a quick look at
the <span   class="bold"><b>Benchmark</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>LWP</b></span> modules, which can help
profile code in general, and which will allow us to see just how
much faster mod_perl and Apache::DBI can make our programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20cc920"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>To get mod_perl working with Apache, you will need to compile
and install the latest versions of both programs. (Full
instructions are available in last month's &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;.) To
take advantage of all of Apache::DBI's features, you will need to
compile mod_perl with more than the default options. These options
can be specified by adding <b  >OPTIONNAME=1</b> on the
same line as the initial invocation of Makefile.PL, the first stage
of the compilation and installation process.</p><p>I found it easiest (if a bit wasteful) to compile using the
<b  >EVERYTHING</b> flag, which turns on all of the
mod_perl options, even those that are unnecessary for Apache::DBI.
To do this, type the following in the initial mod_perl
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL EVERYTHING=1
</pre><p>The rest of the mod_perl and Apache configuration continues
as described last month. See the INSTALL document that comes with
mod_perl to learn how to turn on only those features you need,
rather than using <b  >EVERYTHING=1</b>.
</p><p>Apache::DBI works automatically with programs that use
mod_perl. In other words, any program that uses Apache::Registry
(more or less the mod_perl equivalent of CGI) automatically gets
the benefits of Apache::DBI, assuming that the latter is specified
in the configuration file (described below). You can configure a
directory to use Apache::Registry in much the same way as you can
configure it to use CGI, with directives in the srm.conf file such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Deal with mod_perl
&lt;Location /perl-bin&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Registry
Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>You can then instruct mod_perl to load Apache::DBI in all
directories using Apache::Registry by inserting the following
directive into srm.conf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PerlModule Apache::DBI
</pre>


Now you will need to restart your server, most likely while logged
in as root, by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# killall -v -1 httpd
</pre>


The server is now ready to talk to the database using mod_perl.
Before we can take advantage of Apache::DBI, though, we will need
to investigate DBI a bit more carefully.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20ccdf0"></a>What is DBI?</h2></div></div><p>There are dozens (perhaps hundreds) of databases on the
market, some of which run under Linux. One product which I have
used, both in my own consulting work and in the pages of this
column, is MySQL, a &ldquo;mostly free&rdquo; database (in the author's
words) distributed by TcX DataKonsult AB. The &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; sidebar
contains information on where you can download the source and
binaries for MySQL.</p><p>The CGI programs we wrote in our previous encounters with
MySQL used the <span   class="bold"><b>Mysql</b></span> module for
Perl, which gives us access to all of MySQL's features. Mysql.pm
continues to work just fine for most applications.</p><p>However, if you are interested in keeping up with the latest
standards and trends within the Perl community, you should switch
(as I have) to DBI, the generic database interface for Perl
programs. DBI allows you to use the same code on any number of
databases. That is, you can write a program that talks to MySQL,
Sybase, Oracle or any other database product&mdash;and you will have to
change only one word in order to port the program to another
database product. This makes Perl a very powerful and portable
database-access language.</p><p>DBI is divided into two parts: the generic
<span   class="bold"><b>DBI</b></span> module engine, which can be
downloaded from CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, and a
DBD (database driver) for the particular brand of database you wish
to access. There is only one DBI module, but there is a different
DBD for each database you might wish to access. (See &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;
for information on where you can obtain DBI and DBDs.) If you plan
to use more than one database server, you will have to install more
than one DBD. You can install as many DBDs as you want; they are
installed in parallel, and thus do not conflict.</p><p>If you are using MySQL, then you will have to download the
driver for Msql, the database on whose interface the MySQL API was
modeled. Before it compiles and installs the necessary modules, the
<span   class="bold"><b>Msql-modules</b></span> package asks whether
you want to install DBDs for Msql, MySQL or both.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20cd160"></a>Using DBI</h2></div></div><p>Once you have installed DBI and the appropriate DBD, you will
be able to do just about everything you would normally expect from
a database. The syntax is a bit different from the syntax we have
seen in previous installments of &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;, but is
conceptually quite similar. It should not take you very long to
start using DBI, once you have seen some examples.</p><p>Connections to the database are kept in a database handle,
normally stored in a variable called <b  >$dbh</b>. The
database handle not only gives you a compact, object-oriented way
to access database methods, but also means that you can connect to
multiple databases at the same time, giving each connection its own
database handle. (This might be useful when moving information from
Sybase to Oracle, for example.)</p><p>The basic syntax is fairly straightforward:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $username,
        $password);
</pre><p>As you can see, the <span   class="bold"><b>connect</b></span>
method takes three arguments. The first,
<b  >$data_source</b>, defines the database you wish to
access, as well as the name of the computer on which the server
sits and the access port on that computer. The second two arguments
are theoretically optional, but most configurations will (and
should) require them.
</p><p>For example, most test programs on my home computer use the
following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:mysql:test:localhost");
</pre><p>Because I use the unprotected &ldquo;test&rdquo; database, no user name
or password is necessary. A production site on which user names and
passwords are required would use syntax like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:mysql:classifieds:dbserver",
        "classy" "51haf3");
</pre>


In the above line of code, we are again connecting with the MySQL
DBD. But this time, we are connecting to the database named
<b  >classifieds</b> on a machine named
<b  >dbserver</b>, with the username
<b  >classy</b> and password <b  >51haf3</b>.
Remember that user names and passwords on database systems are
unrelated to user names and passwords on UNIX systems. For security
purposes, you should use different passwords (and perhaps even
different user names) with your databases than are actually in use
on your system.
</p><p>If the connection succeeds, <b  >$dbh</b> can be
used as an entry point into the database. If the connection fails,
<b  >$dbh</b> remains undefined. This allows us to use
the following error-checking code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;log_and_die($DBI::errstr) unless $dbh;
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>&amp;log_and_die</b></span> routine
is one of my old favorites (and probably familiar to long-time
readers of this column), printing an error message on the screen
and then exiting gracefully. Complete listings including the
subroutine &amp;log_and_die are available at
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue52/2991.tgz.
</p><p>Now that we are connected to the database server, we can feed
it one or more queries in SQL, Structured Query Language.</p><p>If we want to insert a value into a table in the database, we
can simply say something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$sql = "INSERT INTO test_insert (contents) VALUES
(\"$random\") ";
</pre><p>Putting the SQL query into a scalar variable before using it
is not required, but helps if and when you need to debug the code.
(This way, you can easily add a &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement in the middle
of your program.)
</p><p>With the query all set, we tell the database to perform the
requested action using the <span   class="bold"><b>do</b></span>
method. This returns a variable which I call
<b  >$successful_insert</b>; much like
<b  >$dbh</b>, <b  >$successful_insert</b> is
defined only if the query was successful:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$successful_insert = $dbh-&gt;do($sql);
print "&lt;P&gt;Success!&lt;/P&gt;\n" if $successful_insert;
</pre><p>Finally, we disconnect from the database. This is not
completely necessary, since Perl will close connections when we are
no longer using them. Nevertheless, it is always a good programming
practice to clean up:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh-&gt;disconnect;
</pre>


The above syntax is good for any SQL query from which we do not
expect a result, namely <b  >INSERT</b>,
<b  >DELETE</b> and <b  >UPDATE</b>. (For more
information about SQL, see Resources for some book
recommendations.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20c4758"></a>Retrieving Rows with SELECT</h2></div></div><p>If we want to retrieve matching rows from the database, we
need to modify the syntax just a bit. After all, we expect to not
only receive a report on whether the database was able to perform
our requested action, but also see the results.</p><p>Assuming we are connected to the database, we set
<b  >$sql</b> to our SQL query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$sql = "SELECT id,contents FROM test_insert";
</pre><p>We then use the <span   class="bold"><b>prepare</b></span>
method to send our query, as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
</pre>


The <b  >$dbh-&gt;prepare</b> result is known as a
&ldquo;statement handle&rdquo;, which is traditionally named
<b  >$sth</b>. Just as <b  >$dbh</b> allows us
to perform operations on the database to which we have connected,
<b  >$sth</b> allows us to perform operations on the
statement we have just sent. And just as <b  >$dbh</b> is
undefined in the case of an error, so too is
<b  >$sth</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;log_and_die($sth-&gt;errstr) unless $sth;
</pre>


Assuming that <b  >$sth</b> was sent to the database
successfully, we tell the database to execute our query, checking
for problems with the return code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sth-&gt;execute || &amp;log_and_die($sth-&gt;err);
</pre>


Now comes the fun part, namely iterating through each of the rows
returned to us. We can find out how many rows were returned as a
result of our query by checking the value of
<b  >$sth-&gt;rows</b>. We can then retrieve each of the
returned rows, one by one (with one column value per row), using
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b>. When there are no more rows
to retrieve, <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b> returns false,
which means that we can use it within a &ldquo;while&rdquo; loop. Indeed,
this is a fairly standard idiom in the DBI world:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Loop through returned rows
while (@row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow)
{
# Grab the columns from the row
$id = $row[0];
$contents = $row[1];
# Print the ID and the contents
print "&lt;P&gt;$id:\"$contents\"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
}
</pre>


When we are finished with this statement, we use the
<span   class="bold"><b>finish</b></span> method associated with the
statement, which is analogous to the
<span   class="bold"><b>disconnect</b></span> method for the database
handle:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sth-&gt;finish;
</pre>


Now that we have reviewed all of this in theory, let's put it into
practice. First, we will create a small table in the &ldquo;test&rdquo;
database in MySQL, by running the
<span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span> client program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql test
</pre>


Once we see the <b  >mysql&gt;</b> prompt, we can create
our small test table:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE test_insert
 (id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY
        KEY, contents VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        UNIQUE (contents));
</pre>


The above defines our table, <b  >test_insert</b>, to
have two columns. The first column, <b  >id</b>, is
defined to contain an unsigned integer. The integer, whose presence
is mandatory (<b  >NOT NULL</b>), is automatically
incremented every time we insert a row into the table and can be
used as a unique index into the table. The second column,
<b  >contents</b>, is a variable-length character string
whose presence is mandatory (<b  >NOT NULL</b>) and which
cannot be repeated in another record (<b  >UNIQUE</b>).
</p><p>The CGI program in <a href="2991l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
demonstrates all of the above, first inserting a number of rows
into the table and then retrieving them. Most DBI programs are as
simple as this one, although many either store or retrieve
information, rather than do both.</p><p>One of the problems with a standard like DBI is that the
interface follows the least common denominator. That is, there are
differences between database packages in addition to their
administration and speed; just about every package includes a
number of non-standard SQL commands and features in order to
differentiate itself from the competition. If you are interested in
using such features, you might have to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>func</b></span> DBI method, which enables
proprietary database extensions. Of course, doing so means that
your program is no longer portable to other databases, which might
be a concern if you switch to another vendor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20c54c0"></a>Moving the Program to Apache::DBI</h2></div></div><p>We have now compiled Apache to use mod_perl, configured a
perl-bin directory for serving mod_perl programs and configured
Apache to insert the Apache::DBI module for all programs within the
perl-bin directory. We are all set to take our sample DBI program
and use it with mod_perl.</p><p>How must we modify the program in order to get it to work
with mod_perl? Actually, we needn't make any modifications at all,
if we have configured our copy of Apache as described above. All we
need to do is copy our program into perl-bin, set the appropriate
permissions and give it a whirl. Here's what I wrote on my
computer, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
~httpd/cgi-bin% cp dbi-demo.pl ../perl-bin/
~httpd/cgi-bin% chmod ug+x ../perl-bin/dbi-demo.pl
</pre><p>I changed the URL in an open browser window such that it
pointed to perl-bin rather than cgi-bin, and&mdash;voil&agrave;--it all
just worked.</p><p>When I first started to use mod_perl and Apache::DBI, I
wasn't sure how much faster programs would run. The execution
certainly seemed faster, but I wasn't sure how much of an
improvement I was seeing. I decided to use Perl's Benchmark module,
comparing the execution speed of two different programs. I would
try to insert 100 random text strings into a database, first using
a CGI program and then using an Apache::DBI version of the same
program (which, as we now know, simply means a version of the
program placed in the perl-bin directory).</p><p>Benchmarking is a tricky and subtle business, and there are
undoubtedly factors which I neglected when calculating these
results. Even so, they seem to bear witness to the amazing
performance difference between CGI and mod_perl. I'm sure if I were
to spend a great deal more time working on my Apache and/or MySQL
configuration, I could get even better performance out of my lowly
75 MHz Pentium running Red Hat 4.2. However, the relative numbers
should speak for themselves.</p><p>First, let's examine the test I performed. I used the same
test_insert table in MySQL as we saw before. I then wrote a CGI
program, similar to the one we saw before, which connects to the
database and inserts a random value into the
<b  >contents</b> column. The resulting program is shown
in <a href="2991l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd4580.0x20c5888"></a>How Fast is it?</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have our test program, how can we actually test
it? I wrote a short Perl program using Benchmark.pm, in
<a href="2991l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a> The
<span   class="bold"><b>timethese</b></span> function is imported by
Benchmark.pm, which we bring in at the beginning of the program. We
also bring in <b  >LWP::Simple</b>, part of the &ldquo;Library
for WWW access in Perl&rdquo; that makes it a snap to write a small web
client. How simple? Well, the following one-liner returns the HTML
contents at http://www.linuxjournal.com/:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -e 'use LWP::Simple;
print get "http://www.linuxjournal.com";'
</pre><p>Perl does not format the output for you. That's the
difference between a web browser and a web client; the former is
meant to retrieve information for humans, while the latter is meant
to retrieve information for programs. In this particular case, we
just want to simulate 100 retrievals of each of our programs via
the web. Any timing differences will thus be due to the program on
the server side&mdash;which, since they are identical, means that the
differences will be due to mod_perl and Apache::DBI.
</p><p>How much faster is the Apache::DBI version than its CGI
counterpart? Here are the results I got running time-db.pl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[1086] ~% ./time-db.pl
Benchmark: timing 100 iterations ...
Apache::DBI: 24 secs (1.77 usr 0.67 sys = 2.44 cpu)
Plain CGI: 394 secs (1.10 usr 0.61 sys = 1.71 cpu)
</pre><p>That's quite a difference. When I first ran this benchmark, I
was convinced that the plain CGI program had somehow gotten stuck.
Alas, that was not the case; the overhead associated with CGI was
simply too great.
</p><p>Here is a second run of the same benchmark, just for
comparison.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[1099] ~% ./time-db.pl
Benchmark: timing 100 iterations ...
Apache::DBI: 28 secs (1.89 usr 0.61 sys = 2.50 cpu)
Plain CGI: 355 secs (1.15 usr 0.62 sys = 1.77 cpu)
</pre><p>Yes, it looks like CGI is indeed much slower. By the way, you
can see that Apache::DBI used more CPU time than plain CGI&mdash;which
means that the time was spent forking the new Perl process, rather
than performing our program's computations.
</p><p>What if we take out the Apache::DBI directive in srm.conf and
restart the server? That would give us an indication of how much
overhead was being used opening the database connection. As you can
see, things do indeed slow down&mdash;although admittedly not by a huge
amount:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[1104] ~% ./time-db.pl
Benchmark: timing 100 iterations ...
Apache::DBI: 34 secs (1.97 usr 0.63 sys = 2.60 cpu)
Plain CGI: 460 secs (1.19 usr 0.60 sys = 1.79 cpu)
</pre><p>The moral, then, seems to be that moving from CGI to mod_perl
gives a huge performance boost, and that moving from DBI to
Apache::DBI gives a moderate performance boost. The more database
accesses your web applications do, the more useful these
technologies will probably be in your work. Perl has always been
known as a useful language, but rarely as one that can help you
write fast software. Now, with mod_perl and Apache::DBI, you can
write web applications quickly, and watch them run quickly as well.
