    Implementing a fall-back e-mail server is easy to do by
    setting the proper entries in the DNS server and running
    sendmail on a Debian Linux system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b44a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One Friday morning several months ago,
the Microsoft Exchange e-mail server I'm in charge of crashed. At
the time, I was a fairly new Windows NT administrator. The server,
which we call tuccster, was not running properly again until late
the following Sunday evening.
</p><p>Unfortunately, at this point my problems had just begun. Our
departmental e-mail server had been down for nearly three days and
megabytes of important e-mail were spooled on remote servers all
over the Internet. There was no way to predict when the mail would
arrive and how much e-mail might never show up. Since different
e-mail servers try to re-send e-mail at different intervals, what
did show up would arrive out of chronological order. While I had
learned a lot about Windows NT disaster recovery, the whole event
was a major inconvenience for the users in my department and a
horrible embarrassment for me.</p><p>While I'm not convinced I could have prevented the failure of
Microsoft Exchange, I could have set up a fall-back e-mail server
to spool all incoming mail while tuccster was down. Shortly after
the mishap, I was able to find an old Gateway 486/66 with an
Ethernet card that was being replaced with a faster Pentium system.
Using Debian Linux and sendmail, I set up a fall-back e-mail server
that receives and spools any incoming e-mail whenever tuccster, the
primary Windows-based server, is down. The addition of a web server
and a simple CGI script written in Perl provided a simple user
interface into the system. I configured the web server so that a
web browser could be used from certain trusted hosts to check if
anything is waiting in the sendmail queue. Once our primary server
is ready to begin receiving e-mail, the sendmail queue can be
flushed by clicking a link on the same web page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b4660"></a>DNS MX Records</h2></div></div><p>A &ldquo;fall-back e-mail server&rdquo; is an old idea on the
Internet&mdash;the functionality to set one up is actually built into
the Domain Name Server (DNS) protocol. The intent was that every
important e-mail server would have a backup in place. A Domain Name
Server contains many types of records. The most common of these
types are SOA records which indicate authority for a domain's data;
NS records which list name servers for a domain;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> records which map a name to an address; PTR
records which perform the reverse, mapping an address to a name;
and MX records which describe &ldquo;mail exchangers&rdquo;. MX records allow
one to define the actual host responsible for receiving mail
directed at any particular host. The host actually responsible for
receiving e-mail need not be the host to which the mail appears to
be addressed.</p><p>To illustrate why this would be useful, imagine a set of
workstations called larry, curly and moe. To reduce the load on
curly and moe, we would like all incoming e-mail to be directed to
larry, regardless of the host to which the mail was actually
addressed. MX records provide a way to achieve this goal. Suppose
we program our DNS server with the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
larry.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
curly.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
moe.tucc.uab.edu.    IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
</pre><p>If somebody tries to send e-mail to foo@moe.tucc.uab.edu, the
mail transport agent (MTA) should look up the DNS record and see
that larry is responsible for all e-mail directed to moe. Not all
MTAs properly implement MX redirection. The mail will then be
delivered to larry as if it were addressed to
foo@larry.tucc.uab.edu.
</p><p>While this is useful, it is not all that can be accomplished
with MX records. The number appearing in the example between &ldquo;MX&rdquo;
and &ldquo;larry.tucc.uab.edu&rdquo; is a preference value. Suppose I was
worried that student projects running on larry might cause the
system to crash periodically, or that larry was running a
less-than-robust e-mail server. I could set up curly as a fall-back
server by using the following DNS entries:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
larry.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
larry.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  2  curly.tucc.uab.edu.
curly.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
curly.tucc.uab.edu.  IN  MX  2  curly.tucc.uab.edu.
moe.tucc.uab.edu.    IN  MX  1  larry.tucc.uab.edu.
moe.tucc.uab.edu.    IN  MX  2  curly.tucc.uab.edu.
</pre><p>Now suppose that larry is down for some reason. A remote host
attempting to send e-mail to larry would discover that larry is
unavailable. It would then learn from DNS that curly is the next
preferred e-mail server for larry. The remote host will send the
message to curly. The mail transport agent (such as sendmail) on
curly will then realize that larry is preferred over curly as a
mail exchange. It then spools the message locally, periodically
attempting to pass the message on until it succeeds.

Linux</h2></div></div><p>You've probably guessed by now that I used this very same
technique to set up my fall-back e-mail server. Serendipitously,
one of the older 486 computers in the department was slated for
replacement with a shiny new Pentium-based PC. This computer, with
16MB of RAM, a 600MB hard drive and an Ethernet card was the
perfect computer for the job. Setting up the computer was
relatively easy. I chose to install the Debian distribution, since
I'm most familiar with it. I could just as easily have used any of
the other distributions. The components essential to my setup are
the latest version of sendmail, the Apache web server (although
NCSA, CERN or another web server would have worked) and Perl. I
also installed other tools, such as Emacs, gcc, make, rcs and vi to
make myself more comfortable while working on the system.</p><p>These utilities also allowed me to rebuild the kernel without
using another system, and they should come in handy if I ever have
to repair the system after some sort of mishap. I left all X11
libraries off the system to save disk space. After compiling a
kernel containing just the modules I needed to run the system, I
created a rescue boot floppy with this same kernel. There's no
reason not to be prepared for the worst. Finally, I dubbed the
system bartleby, after the downtrodden scrivener in the Dead Letter
Office of Herman Melville's short story <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bartleby the
Scrivener</em></span>.</p><p>The next step was to choose an appropriate location for
bartleby to live. Simply placing bartleby in the same room as
tuccster would provide adequate backup if tuccster crashed of its
own accord again. However, by now I had disaster recovery on the
brain and wanted to protect against other sorts of failures. I
finally settled on a location in our mainframe room, which is
located in a different building. This placed bartleby on a
different subnet than tuccster, so no e-mail would be lost if our
own subnet failed. Being in the mainframe room also meant that
bartleby was located on a protected power system.</p><p>Long after tuccster has been automatically shut down by its
UPS, bartleby will be merrily spooling any incoming e-mail. The
wisdom of placing the system on a separate subnet was proven
several months later when our own subnet was accidently
disconnected by maintenance workers. With bartleby properly in
place, all that was left was adding the appropriate entry to our
DNS and configuring sendmail and the web server.</p><p>Just as in my example with the Three Stooges, I wanted to add
MX records to our domain name server so that both bartleby and
tuccster were listed as MX hosts for tuccster, with tuccster as the
preferred host. The two MX records as I entered them are shown in
<a href="2469l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>While configuring sendmail is often something to fear, it was
easy in this case. <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> will
correctly process deferred e-mail by default. All that was
necessary was configuring sendmail to send and receive e-mail
directed to and from bartleby, something handled automatically by
the Debian package install script. Once I finished the sendmail
install, bartleby was working correctly as a fall-back e-mail
server. The next time I brought tuccster down for maintenance, I
examined the sendmail queue on bartleby using the <b  >sendmail
-bp</b> command. Sure enough, several e-mail messages were in
the queue, waiting for tuccster to wake up again. After I brought
tuccster back on-line, I flushed the queue using the
<b  >sendmail -q</b> command.</p><p>It is possible to adjust the frequency with which sendmail
attempts to process any spooled messages by appending a time
argument to the <b  >-q</b> command when sendmail is
first started. The Debian package for sendmail includes a macro at
the beginning of the sendmail startup script that makes setting
this value easy. I set mine to 30 minutes (the actual command-line
argument is <b  >-q30m</b>). The sendmail man page
describes the syntax for the <b  >-q</b> command. I
automatically shut down the Exchange server late each Friday night
to save its message store to tape. I wanted bartleby to flush its
queue automatically so any messages that were deferred during the
backup would arrive properly without human intervention. You may
wish to lengthen the time between queue flushes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b4fa8"></a>Creating a Simple Web-based Interface</h2></div></div><p>The system as I had it set up was pretty good. However, it
did require at least a minimal understanding of the UNIX shell to
log in and check or flush the sendmail queue. I wanted to make the
system as foolproof as possible in the event something happened
while I was away from the office. I settled on a simple CGI script
written in Perl. This script (see <a href="2469l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>) displays the current contents of the sendmail queue, as
well as the output from the <span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span>
command. This allows someone to see at a glance what e-mail
messages are spooled in the system and how much disk space remains.
If the sendmail queue is not empty, a link is created that can be
clicked to flush the queue.</p><p>Since this is the only service this web server provides, I
called it &ldquo;index.cgi&rdquo; and placed it in the root of the server
directory. Adding &ldquo;index.cgi&rdquo; to the DirectoryIndex list in the
srm.conf configuration file causes the script to be executed
automatically when the server is accessed. I also adjusted the
MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers values in the httpd.conf file,
so that no spare servers are left running. In this case, I don't
mind slowing the response time to free up a little extra memory.
There were a few final security issues to contemplate. I consider
the listing of the sendmail queue to be &ldquo;sensitive but
unclassified&rdquo; information. By this, I mean I don't feel an
intruder would find the information contained therein particularly
useful, but then again I don't see the need to make the information
easily available to the entire Internet. The action of flushing the
queue is nearly harmless on its own, though I suppose it would be
possible to mount a denial-of-service attack by repeatedly flushing
the queue. In the end, I decided to allow non-password based access
from a handful of machines in the department.</p><p>Each of these machines is located in the office of an
administrator who might have a reason to check the queue. I
implemented these restrictions with the Apache directives shown in
<a href="2469l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> in the access.conf
file.</p><p>I could have added the standard plaintext password
authentication available through nearly every web browser, but I
don't believe it would have added enough real security to offset
the inconvenience. A screen shot of this web interface is shown
below.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2469f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>I decided to restrict shell access to myself. Furthermore, I
installed the s/key system from Bell Labs to avoid plaintext
passwords and used TCP Wrappers to restrict the hosts that can log
into the system. While there is little to be gained (other than,
perhaps, traffic analysis) from examining the sendmail queue, much
could be gained from unrestricted access to any incoming e-mail
message.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b5478"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Setting up a fall-back e-mail server using a Linux system
running on older hardware is an excellent tool to preserve incoming
e-mail in the event of a disaster on your primary server. While I
am backing up a Microsoft Exchange server, the same technique can
be used to back up an SMTP server from any vendor. Setting up the
fall-back server costs nearly nothing other than the time required
for configuration. Having a very stable system completely
independent of the rest of our network has also proven useful.
Since I first configured bartleby, I have set up a collection of
relatively simple scripts to watch other services on our network
and page me in the event of an irregularity.</p><p>A fall-back e-mail system is a good way to sneak Linux into a
low profile but &ldquo;mission-critical&rdquo; application in your
organization. Once you've proven Linux is a &ldquo;real&rdquo; operating
system to any skeptical decision maker, you can begin to utilize it
in higher-profile roles.</p></div></div>
