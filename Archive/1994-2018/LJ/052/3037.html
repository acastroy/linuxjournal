    <i  >LJ</i>'s publisher flies to the east coast for the annual
    UniForum conference and spends more time at Linux track
    sessions than on the beach.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x27043a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I am writing this article as I fly back
from the UniForum Association Spring '98 Conference. This was only
the second East Coast conference held by UniForum in its 17-year
history. It was held in Ocean City, Maryland&mdash;a beautiful town by
the Atlantic Ocean.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3037f2forcd.large.jpg"><img src="3037f2forcd.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Ocean City, Maryland
</p></div></div><p>UniForum is an advocacy organization that promotes the use of
Open Computing solutions&mdash;or, to put it in succinct terms, the use
of UNIX and UNIX-like solutions. UniForum and Usenix have tended to
complement each other with UniForum being the conference for suits
and Usenix the conference for T-shirts.</p><p>The conference was a two and a half day event that looked
light on paper. Once there, I discovered there was too much to do
in such a short time. For the first two days, there were three
tracks: <span   class="emphasis"><em>New Open Software Development Model and
Linux</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Computing</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Best of SCO Forum</em></span>. All tracks included common
Plenary and Keynote sessions. On the third day there were two
three-hour sessions: one presented by the Open Group and the other
by Linux International. I attended all the Linux track sessions as
well as the common sessions.</p><p>Monday's Plenary session was Eric Raymond's presentation of
his paper <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span> which
is credited with convincing Netscape to take their Open Source
stance.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3037f5forcd.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Eric Raymond
</p></div></div><p>If you haven't heard the talk or read the paper, it is
available on our Linux Resources page.</p><p>After Jon Hall introduced the Linux track, Frank Hecker, who
is a systems engineer at Netscape, gave a talk entitled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Why and the How</em></span> that filled in the
background of Netscape's decision to embrace the Open Source model.
For those of us who have been involved in what I call &ldquo;revolution
from below&rdquo;--that is, attempting to sell Linux or Open Source to
those in the trenches and let it move up the corporate
ladder&mdash;Frank had some interesting things to say. He said the
engineers didn't believe Open Source could happen with Netscape.
So, Frank went to Marc Andreessen with the idea, and the rest is
history.</p><p>After Frank's talk, we got together for the keynote lunch
where Ralph Nader spoke on the Microsoft monopoly and how Linux
could be a big player in an alternate solution.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3037f3forcd.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Ralph Nader
</p></div></div><p>It was a treat to get to meet Ralph and to hear the word
Linux come out of his mouth just a few days after hearing Marc
Andreessen say it. I brought up how U.S. government procurements
used to require a POSIX-compliant operating system be made
available with any system they purchased, and Ralph and his
staffers are going to look into why that requirement was dropped. I
asked him to keep <i  >LJ</i> up to date on any
findings, but you might also wish to check out his web site at
http://www.essential.org/.</p><p>Two afternoon sessions were held in the Linux track. The
first was presented by Ron Workman of Cygnus Solutions, and the
second was presented by me. Covering mine is easy&mdash;I went through a
series of articles which have appeared in our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means
Business</em></span> column, illustrating how companies identified a
problem, then used Linux to address that problem.</p><p>Ron's talk addressed Open Source software from a different
direction: how a company can succeed in the business of supporting
freely available software. Cygnus was founded in 1989 to provide
commercial support for open Internet technologies and has grown to
160 employees. The company has succeeded by offering consulting and
support on such products as the Free Software Foundation's GNU C
Compiler.</p><p>Monday evening was filled with good food and bad beer (Coors
Light?&mdash;lucky Linus wasn't there) at a beach party hosted by Red
Hat Software. Like most parties at these conferences, the evening
was filled with meeting others and talking about computers, the
UNIX market and telling Microsoft jokes. I found it a valuable time
to get to know people better, for example, Morgan Von Essen and
Garry Paxinos of Metro Link, and to thank Alan Fedder and Kathy
Goetz of UniForum for organizing the conference.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3037f1forcd.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Tuesday morning started with a Plenary by Eid Eid, President
of Corel Computer (see <i  >LJ</i>, Issue 48). If I had
to choose one person who provided me with the most new information,
I would choose Eid. I did cheat a little however, as I also talked
to him extensively over lunch.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3037f4forcd.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Eid Eid
</p></div></div><p>Eid's Plenary was a pleasant combination of future fantasy
and a look at what is available today. The fantasy part consisted
of describing a day in the life of Mr. Twenty O'One, illustrating
what we should expect in the near future (2001 isn't that far away)
from our personal communicator: voice- and e-mail access, voice
commands and an interface to the Corel NetWinder.</p><p>At the office, Mr. Twenty O'One will have a typical
Intel-based PC but most of his work will be done on his personal
communicator and his NetWinder. The NetWinder is much faster for
doing common tasks because, while it is a complete Linux system,
common tasks (everything from e-mail to video conferencing and
replying to e-mail with a voice message automatically appended to
e-mail) are trivial to access.</p><p>After this fictional introduction, Eid went on to cover the
pieces which actually exist today, including the NetWinder, video
conferencing, XML and capable portable systems. He went on to say
that we need to make all the interfaces and standards open so any
vendor can produce pieces which interoperate. I expect some people
were surprised when he said, &ldquo;Corel, Lotus and others will have no
choice but to provide some source code for commercial products in
the near future.&rdquo;</p><p>Eid also pointed out that Microsoft controls over 50% of the
money made on PC applications. Eid was the Chief Technical Officer
for Corel Corporation, makers of CorelDraw and owner of Corel
Computer before becoming President of Corel Computer. He explained
how Corel had been a Microsoft partner until Corel acquired
WordPerfect, then Microsoft started hiding technology from
them.</p><p>As many of us have concluded in the past, Eid believes you
cannot successfully fight Microsoft, but went on to point out what
you can do. He sees the network computer as the new wave, being
less costly and more maintainable. The network computer opens up a
new market and, done right, it can become a market as large as
today's personal computer market.</p><p>The morning session in the Linux Track included a
presentation by Don Rosenberg of Stromian Technologies on making
money with Open Source as an OEM/VAR. Differing from Ron Workman's
presentation of the previous day, Don's presentation was a
mini-tutorial on how to get into a market and how to make the right
distribution choices along the way.</p><p>Next, Morgan Von Essen, President of Metro Link, with the
help of Garry Paxinos, Vice President, presented a talk on Metro
Link's cooperative work with the XFree86 community&mdash;another model
of a commercial enterprise working with the free software
community. In this case, they developed technology needed for their
commercial customers and then gave that technology back to the
XFree86 community. Doing this makes it easier for Metro Link to
continue development, because their work becomes standard in new
XFree86 releases.</p><p>Tuesday's keynote lunch was presented by Janpieter Scheerder
who was President of Sunsoft and has now moved to head the storage
division of Sun. He talked about WebTone and made some very
interesting points demonstrating how the non-Microsoft community is
growing faster than the Microsoft community. His pointed out that
while MS Windows sales are growing at 13% a year, companies like
Cisco are growing at 30%, and that while there are over 100,000,000
MS/PC users, that number is a small minority of the six billion
people on the planet. He also pointed out that every Quicken user
who registers their product is a UNIX user since the Quicken
on-line registration server runs on Sun systems.</p><p>Janpieter explained that today most ISVs will port their
product to either NT or Solaris. By mentioning an old Dutch saying,
&ldquo;the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&rdquo; he clearly sees Linux as an
ally. By the same reasoning, we need to see Sun ports as potential
Linux ports of the future.</p><p>Janpieter, like Eid, pointed out that the network computer is
in&mdash;all we need is a $150 device to connect to the Internet. He
then went on to talk about two subjects: first
&ldquo;OPEN-standardization&rdquo; and then Java. This got a reaction from
both Eric Raymond and Eid Eid, who both pointed out that for Java
to be the answer, its standard needs to be open. There was no
resolution, but I am sure we were heard.</p><p>The afternoon Linux track brought Bob Young, discussing the
size of the Linux market or, more accurately, explaining how hard
it is to come up with an accurate estimate. Bob also announced the
availability of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Extreme Linux</em></span> CD which
includes all the Beowulf RPMs for those of you who want to build
your own supercomputer. Jon Hall of Linux International closed the
track with some general comments and preparation work for the
workshop the following morning.</p><p>On Wednesday the Linux track attendees changed their plans
and attended the first hour of a presentation entitled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>What Exciting Technology is Emerging?</em></span> by The
Open Group, the organization that owns the UNIX brand and
standards. In this presentation, the Open Group announced the
UNIX'98 standard.</p><p>Historically, vendors such as Digital, Hewlett-Packard and
Sun have paid a lot of money to use the UNIX brand. This money goes
to support The Open Group's work on the standards and enforcement
of the trademark. While it would be great for Linux or a Linux
distribution to be UNIX branded, the cost is prohibitive.</p><p>The Open Group has now recognized the advantage of getting
the Linux community on board. While Sun and others anchor the high
end of the Open Systems community, having an entry-level system
compatible with the standard would be a plus. This is not yet a
done deal. While the use of the UNIX trademark is limited to those
who have paid the fees, the opportunity will be present for a
system to be conformant with the standard. Stay tuned, this could
be the <span   class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> necessary to tighten the bond
between Linux and the rest of the UNIX community.</p><p>For more information on the UNIX'98 standard, see the web
page http://www.UNIX-systems.org/. Version 2 in HTML can be browsed
or downloaded at http://www.UNIX-systems.org/go/unix/.</p><p>The melding of minds with regard to UNIX standards, Open
Computing and Open Source software needs a venue and UniForum has
elected to be that venue. Here's what Alan Fedder, President of
UniForum had to say about it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>UniForum Association is the only forum for open
discussion and open debate about open computing. Where else could
Eric Raymond and Mike Lambert [of The Open Group] debate each
other, listen to each other, and have a better understanding of
each other's position? Where else could you hear Ralph Nader, Eid
Eid, Janpieter Scheerer, Eric Raymond&mdash;all quoting Eric Raymond?
Momentous things happened at the UniForum Spring Conference in
Ocean City&mdash;and I honestly believe that five years from now, 5,000
people will be telling each other they were there when UNIX was
saved.</p></blockquote></div><p>In conclusion, I found attending the conference to be truly
worthwhile and look forward to going again next year.</p></div></div>
