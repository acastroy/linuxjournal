    So you've heard a lot about the power of Linux and you're
    eager to try it out for yourself. But where do you start?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x29382f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Whether you're a long-time Linux user or
a total newbie who needs to obtain Linux software for that first
install, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the vast amount of
Linux information available. Finding the best approach to getting
help on a particular problem is no simple task. Since Linux is an
independent happening&mdash;no company or sole entity
<span   class="emphasis"><em>owns</em></span> what is essentially a continually-growing
resource, free for all humanity&mdash;this tangle of information can be
confusing. Here's an attempt to outline the most efficient means of
getting help with Linux.
</p><p>First, understand that no matter what your skill level,
you're not alone. Help is always available&mdash;in fact, one of the
strengths of the free software movement is that you don't have to
wait on a tech support line, or rely on any one business (and local
business hours) for help&mdash;individuals and companies all over the
world can provide all levels of support.</p><p>There are four basic routes to getting help with Linux; the
one you choose for any particular problem will depend on what that
problem is. These routes almost always overlap, and eventually
you'll probably have dealt with all four in varying degrees. They
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Books and Media</p></li><li><p>The Internet</p></li><li><p>Regional user groups</p></li><li><p>Consultants</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x2938818"></a>Books and Media</h2></div></div><p>If you already have a computer you want to run Linux on, and
you're ready to begin fiddling with the hardware settings, then
this is a good place to begin. Books are also the best desktop
reference to keep handy when you need quick information&mdash;and you
can take them along when you're away from a computer. For
beginners, a good book is quite a deal because it often comes
bundled with a Linux CD-ROM.</p><p>Note, however, that like any other popular subject, the
mileage of any given Linux book will vary&mdash;they range from
excellent tomes of which a shopworn copy is an absolute
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> for every Linux guru's lair, to those
that contain inaccuracies and typos. This same warning also applies
to the many Linux CD-ROMs available.</p><p>When you are in the market for a CD-ROM, make sure that you
are getting a recent distribution; these can be obtained from many
vendors, such as Cheap Bytes, Prime Time Freeware and Linux System
Labs, often for as little as a few dollars. Be wary of older
CD-ROMs; using older versions of the software may be more trouble
than they're worth&mdash;the active and continual development of the
Linux system means that the software on old CD-ROMs will be
significantly different from the bleeding edge Linux that's out in
the field. Since Linux is constantly getting easier to install and
use and hardware compatibilities are always being added, you will
save yourself some grief by installing from the newest version you
can get.</p><p>On that note, be careful of the publication date on any books
you might be considering. As a rule, any technical book or CD is
outdated to some degree upon publication. It is generally safe to
assume that <span   class="emphasis"><em>any Linux book or CD over a year and a half
old is hopelessly out of date</em></span>. Furthermore, if you find
a Linux book or CD more than <span   class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> years old,
consider it an object of Internet and computing antiquity&mdash;maybe
keep it for historical purposes or as a conversation piece.</p><p>When it comes to applied computing&mdash;and specifically the
Internet/UNIX world&mdash;the books published by O'Reilly &amp;
Associates seem to be without peer. Their <span   class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP Network
Administration</em></span> by Craig Hunt is a must-have for learning
the basics of Internet networking, and they've done the same with
their selection of fine books on Linux. The latest edition of their
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, by Matt Welsh and Lar
Kaufman, is perhaps the finest all-around general-purpose Linux
overview currently available.</p><p>The Free Software Foundation also publishes many books
documenting free software, including the GNU Emacs editor; unlike
most other publishers of technical manuals, the FSF's books are as
free as the software they write about, and buying these books is a
good way to show support for this organization.</p><p>As far as CD-ROMs are concerned, you will probably want to
stick with those containing either (or both) the Debian or Red Hat
distributions of Linux. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>distribution</em></span> is
necessary; it is simply a collection of the various programs and
applications which make up a running, usable Linux system, along
with some way of upgrading or maintaining the system. They all
contain the same Linux programs and software, but each one collects
them differently and has a different means for installation and
upgrades.</p><p>Slackware was an early distribution that was excellent for
its time, but seems to have taken a back seat recently as far as
popularity goes. There are many other less popular distributions,
each with its own strengths and weaknesses&mdash;but for a beginner,
sticking with one of the top two (Debian and Red Hat) is probably
your best bet. As was pointed out on IRC recently, distributions
are to Linux like flavors are to ice cream&mdash;there's much more than
just vanilla and chocolate out there, and which one you eventually
settle down with will depend on your own taste.</p><p>Debian GNU/Linux is a free distribution that, like Linux
itself, is assembled by a loose collection of enthusiasts. Red Hat
is a commercial product (<span   class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> assembled by
Linux enthusiasts) that most consider to be much easier to install
and maintain.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x2938e48"></a>The Internet</h2></div></div><p>On-line is where all the action is, for sure! Like most free
software, Linux was developed in its entirety by a virtual
community on the Internet, and the Internet is where you'll always
find the latest and greatest in Linux developments. You're missing
out on a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> if you're not connected to the
Internet. The ISP Hookup HOWTO gives all the details.</p><p>If you want, you can download Linux right off the Net and
onto your computer. I've done this myself, and it's still my
preferred method of installation on systems that don't have a
CD-ROM drive. But be warned: this could take quite some time with a
regular modem connection.</p><p>The general path to take when downloading Linux from the Net
is first to download a set of installation disks&mdash;typically 5-10
diskettes&mdash;from which you install a bare-bones Linux system on your
computer. Then use your existing Internet connection (a modem and
an ISP dial-up account, for instance) to reconnect and download the
specific applications and packages that you need. Instructions on
how to do this are at both the Red Hat and Debian web sites.</p><p>I also like to frequent the 2GB+ Linux software repository at
Sunsite, a machine hosted by the University of North Carolina.
(There are mirrors of it worldwide.) They also host an excellent
hands-on tutorial for total newbies who want to learn how to use
Linux.</p><p>Not only is the Net where all the developments are taking
place, but this is also where some of the best help and
documentation can be found. If you want to learn how to do
something with Linux, or have a question about some aspect of your
Linux system, here is the way to go about finding an answer on the
Net (see Resources for addresses):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Check the HOWTOs</b></span>.
The Linux HOWTOs are part of the Linux Documentation Project and a
useful collection of up-to-the-minute tutorials on how to do
various things with your system.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Look it up at the
LDP</b></span>. The Linux Documentation Project is an intense
collection of free documentation on Linux, including the HOWTOs and
several full-fledged Linux books (some of which are available from
O'Reilly and others).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Search netnews</b></span>.
Usenet, or &ldquo;netnews&rdquo;, is a huge, ongoing discussion base on the
Net, and the Linux newsgroups are among Usenet's busiest. Searching
it with tools such as DejaNews and AltaVista and entering &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;
and key terms that relate to your search will often yield positive
results.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wade through Linux
links</b></span>. The Linux Resources Page is hosted by the
pro-Linux consultants at SSC (publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>), and contains links to just about every Linux
resource on the Net. Worth searching here are the archives to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s digital sister publication.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ask on IRC</b></span>. The
#linux and #linuxhelp channels on IRC can provide you with instant
help from a live person. Used sparingly, this can be an excellent
resource for quickly finding out just what you need to know.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Post on netnews</b></span>.
If you still haven't found your answer, open up your news-reader
software and post your question to the appropriate Linux newsgroup
on Usenet. You'll be answered by a live human (probably several)
who will help you for free. There's only one catch: once you too
become a Linux guru, return the favor and spend a little time on
Usenet helping out a newbie with a problem for which you know the
solution.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x2939898"></a>Regional User Groups</h2></div></div><p>Regional Linux User Groups have been popularized by the folks
at SSC and have really taken off in the past six months. Called
GLUE&mdash;Groups of Linux Users Everywhere&mdash;the idea of regional LUGs
has spread to the point that there is now a LUG in almost every
major city, and in many out-of-the-way places, too.</p><p>Talking to the folks at a LUG can be extremely helpful if
you're a total newbie and need help with Linux. It's also a great
way to see some of the amazing things that others are doing with
Linux in your area&mdash;I always come out of our LUG meetings here in
Cleveland having learned something new. And LUGs hosting Linux
&ldquo;Install Fests&rdquo; are not uncommon; this is a meeting where you can
bring in your computer, and LUG volunteers will install Linux on it
for you for free (or a small donation).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x29399f8"></a>Consultants</h2></div></div><p>You may represent a company or other entity with specialized
needs or requiring a great deal of support; if so, there is a whole
<span   class="emphasis"><em>world</em></span> of Linux consultants out there. Start
with the Linux-Consultants HOWTO (see Resources), but note that a
number of traditional computer consulting firms and even ISPs now
provide Linux consulting services.</p><p>Another rising trend is companies who provide preconfigured
Linux systems. If you don't yet have the hardware, this can be a
good way to purchase a running Linux system and not have to bother
with installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2840580.0x2939bb0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>These sources will almost certainly be able to fulfill any
need you have in starting out with, or getting help on, a
particular aspect of Linux. Yes, mastering Linux does require some
effort, but the best things in life always do. That does not mean
running Linux is any more difficult than non-free software or
requires you to be a programmer&mdash;in fact,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anyone</em></span> can learn Linux! It's just that you do
have to put some thought into the process, as you did when you
learned to drive a car or to speak a foreign language. Those were
worthwhile tasks, and you will find that the time spent learning
Linux is, too.</p><p><a href="2500s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
