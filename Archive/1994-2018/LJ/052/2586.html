    Mr. Pruett tells us how his company creates on-the-fly plots
    of database information for web display.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5a500"></a></h2></div></div><p>I work at Virginia Power, an electric
utility that services a large section of the southeastern United
States. Part of my group's job is to collect and archive data from
thousands of devices in the field, such as electrical transformers
and circuits. Our use of Linux to collect this data is a story in
itself (see &ldquo;SCADA&mdash;Linux Still Hard At Work&rdquo; in the January and
February 1995 issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>).
</p><p>To make this vast amount of data accessible throughout our
company, my group built a set of Intranet applications. These
applications are accessible to anyone on our company network using
a standard web browser.</p><p>Using one of these applications, our users can generate
graphic plots of data from our databases. For example, an engineer
may want to see a plot of the electrical load on a particular
transformer during the course of a month. Our program can extract
data from our database, create a plot of that data and display the
graphic through the user's web browser in a matter of
seconds.</p><p>Using tools that come with most standard Linux distributions,
you too can build web-based plots on demand. The tools you will
need include Perl, the <span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span>
graphics package, and the <span   class="bold"><b>NetPBM</b></span>
graphics conversion tools. I'll assume you already have a web
server up and running. We use the Apache web server, but the
techniques described here will work with other web servers
too.</p><p>Before I show you how to tie these tools together, you'll
need to get and install gnuplot and the NetPBM packages. See
&ldquo;Resources&rdquo; for information on Internet sites and Linux
distributions where you can get these packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5a870"></a>What is gnuplot?</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> is a
device-independent plotting package that has been available for
various Unices, as well as other platforms, for many years. It
features its own language for creating and displaying two- and
three-dimensional plots. Commands can be entered interactively, one
at a time, or can be placed together into a gnuplot script file and
run as a batch job.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> supports a wide
variety of output devices. The most useful of these devices can be
an X window. You can run gnuplot from an xterm under X Windows, and
it can plot your data into a separate X window. This is a good way
for those unfamiliar with gnuplot to learn all about the various
commands.</p><p>Since gnuplot can take its commands from script files and its
data from simple text files, it's the perfect tool to automate the
generation of graphics when requested by a web server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5aad8"></a>Plotting access_log Data</h2></div></div><p>I doubt you have much interest in plotting load curves of
electrical transformers, so I'll present a more generally useful
example. The example is a CGI Perl script that plots web server
hits over the course of a given day.</p><p>The script will require some understanding of Perl; the small
amount of CGI knowledge required will be explained as
needed.</p><p>First, let's describe what the script needs to do. Every time
a person requests information from an Apache web server, the
request is logged to a file called <b  >access_log</b>.
This log resides in the web server's log directory. The exact
location of this directory depends on how you have set up your web
server. Each line of the log represents a single web hit. A line
from an Apache server's <b  >access_log</b> file looks
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foobar.mydomain.org
- - [01/Sep/1997:17:14:31 -0400]
"GET /images/gnuplot_10270.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 9538
</pre><p>This line indicates that a web browser at foobar.mydomain.org
requested the file /images/gnuplot_10270.gif to be sent to it at
5:14 PM on September 1. All lines in the log have the same format,
so we should be able to extract just those lines that match the
date we're seeking.
</p><p>We can also tell the hour and minute of the access. We'll
want to keep a count of the number of accesses for each minute of
our target day. This data will be sent to gnuplot so it can create
our plot. We'll want to create a simple x-y line plot of the data,
with time of day on the x axis and number of hits on the y
axis.</p><p>Once the graph has been plotted, we'll need to convert it to
a graphics format that can be displayed with a web browser.
Finally, we'll need to build an HTML page to send back to the
browser. This page will have an image tag in it that points back to
the graphics file we just created.</p><p>Don't worry if this seems like a lot of hoops to jump
through. It can all be done in seven short steps with less than 100
lines of code. The complete Perl script is shown in
<a href="2586l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. The code is divided
into numbered sections for easy reference. Let's look at the script
one section at a time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5af50"></a>Section 1: Where to Find the Files</h2></div></div><p>The first section of Listing 1 requires little explanation. I
just assign variables for file names and directories that will be
used later. This is the section you might change if your web
server's directories are different from mine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5b058"></a>Section 2: The Date to Search For</h2></div></div><p>The Perl script is meant to be started when a web browser
requests it. In other words, it is a CGI program. A Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) program provides a standard mechanism for providing
&ldquo;interactive content&rdquo; over the Internet. Instead of requesting a
static HTML document, the web browser asks the web server to run a
program that will dynamically create an HTML document. CGI programs
can be written in any language, but Perl is by far the most common
language for CGI programming today.</p><p>My CGI script will actually run as a stand-alone program from
the command line, although it isn't particularly useful when run
that way. Running as a CGI program, it gains one important aspect:
access to the <span   class="bold"><b>QUERY_STRING</b></span>
environment variable. The
<span   class="bold"><b>QUERY_STRING</b></span> environment variable
is one way to pass information to a CGI program. If
<span   class="bold"><b>QUERY_STRING</b></span> has been defined,
then our program expects it to contain a date. This date should be
in dd/mmm/yyyy format (e.g., 12/Sep/1997). That's the same format
Apache uses to log its dates.</p><p>If <span   class="bold"><b>QUERY_STRING</b></span> isn't
defined, we'll assume we should look for access data for today's
date. In either case, the date we're seeking is stored in the
variable <b  >$date</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5b3c8"></a>Section 3: Searching the access_log File</h2></div></div><p>In section 3 of Listing 1, we open the Apache access log and
begin looking for lines that contain our target date. When we find
a date that matches, we extract the hour and minute and place them
in the variables <b  >$inhour</b> and
<b  >$inmin</b>.</p><p>It's at this point that we run into a slight conceptual
problem. We want to plot time of day on the x axis of our plot, but
what we actually have is hours and minutes. What value will be
plotted on the x axis? What we want is a time line from 12:01 AM to
midnight. If we just turned times into integers, we would get
values like 1024 for 10:24 AM.
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> could plot this, but since
there are only 60 minutes in an hour, there would be a gap at the
end of each plotted hour. There are many ways to solve this
problem. The one I used was simply to scale the minutes 0 to 59 to
a value between 0 and 99. The hours are then multiplied by 100 and
the converted minutes are added to them. Thus, the time 1:30 PM
becomes the integer value 1350. Our plot will only have tic marks
for hours, so no one will notice our little conversion.</p><p>So in this section of code, we convert the hours and minutes
to an integer value and use it as an array index for an array of
counters called <b  >$accesses</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5b6e0"></a>Section 4: Getting the Data Ready for
gnuplot</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> can plot the data it
reads from a text file. We need to write a file for gnuplot, where
each line of the file contains two integer values. The first value
will be our time value (the x axis) and the second value will be
the number of web hits at that time (the y axis). The file will
contain 2401 values. Here are a few lines from an example
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0808  1
0809  0
0810  1
0811  2
0812  0
0813  21
0814  0
0815  12
</pre><p>This file shows a few minutes during the 8 o'clock hour. We
create the file by printing out the data in our $accesses array.
Here we encounter another little &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;. Perl creates something
called &ldquo;sparse arrays&rdquo;. This just means that array elements are
created as they are defined. In other words, if there were no
accesses at 8:12 AM, as in our sample data above, then no
corresponding array element is created. It's undefined.
</p><p>Normally in Perl, you can traverse an array using a
<b  >foreach</b> loop. In our case though, we need to
output data for all time intervals, even those times when no
accesses took place. We need this so we have a contiguous set of
data for gnuplot to graph.</p><p>This is actually very easy to do. In section 4 of Listing 1,
we set up a simple <b  >for</b> loop. Using Perl's
defined function, we determine if an array element exists. If it
does, we simply print the index value as our x value and the access
count as our y value. If the array element isn't defined, we know
there were no accesses at that time, so we print out a zero as our
y value.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1a5ba50"></a>Section 5: Building a gnuplot Command
File</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> will automatically
label the x and y axes with values from our data set. If the
maximum number of web hits for any time interval in the data set
was 48, then gnuplot might create tic marks on the y axis at 0, 10,
20, 30, 40 and 50. This would be fine for the y axis, but remember
that the x axis contains a calculated time value that might not
make much sense to a person reading our graph.</p><p>Luckily, we can override the default tic marks and create our
own. That's the job of the <b  >for</b> loop at the
beginning of section five. We create a text string that will be
embedded in the gnuplot command file we are about to create.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> creates plots based
on a set of commands you provide it. Actually, gnuplot has only two
commands for plotting data, <span   class="bold"><b>plot</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>splot</b></span>, and we'll be using the
simpler of the two in our program. The other command we'll use is
<span   class="bold"><b>set</b></span> to enable and disable
particular options and features in gnuplot. The Perl print
statement in section five of Listing 1 handles writing a gnuplot
command file to disk.</p><p>Those not overly familiar with Perl may find this variation
of the print statement somewhat confusing. Let's look at that
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print GPFILE &lt;&lt;EOM;
</pre><p>This print command tells Perl to write every line in the Perl
script following it to the file opened with the GPFILE file handle.
It stops printing lines to the file when Perl encounters the line
in the script consisting only of the letters EOM. So all the lines
in section five following the print statement and continuing to the
EOM line are not Perl statements at all, but are gnuplot commands
that will be written by Perl to the gnuplot command file.
</p><p>The print command will also substitute the Perl variable
references with their values, so the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set title "Web Server Accesses $mon $day, $year"
</pre><p>might be written to the file as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set title "Web Server Accesses Aug 12, 1997"
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1e542d0"></a>Section 6: Creating the Plot Graphic</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a data file and a gnuplot command file, how
do we get our plot? And how do we show it to the user? This turns
out to be the easy part.</p><p>First, we need to talk a bit more about gnuplot. I mentioned
earlier that gnuplot can display to a variety of devices, including
X terminals. But gnuplot can also write a file in portable pixmap
format (PPM). In section five of the Perl script, note that we
write the gnuplot command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set term pbm color
</pre><p>to the gnuplot command file. This tells gnuplot to write the
output to a file.
</p><p>However, this only takes us part of the way. Web browsers
don't know what to do with PPM files; they usually want either a
GIF or JPEG file. That's where the NetPBM package comes in. This is
a set of command line utilities that convert from one format to
another. One of those tools is exactly what we're looking for: the
aptly named <span   class="bold"><b>ppmtogif</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>ppmtogif</b></span> is a simple filter
program. It takes a PPM image file from standard input and writes a
GIF file to standard output. Since most web browsers support GIF,
ppmtogif fits our needs perfectly.</p><p>Thus, section six turns out to be almost trivial. We use a
Perl system call to run our UNIX commands, then run gnuplot using
the command file we created in section five (which in turn will
read the data file we built in section four).
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> sends the graphic in PPM
format to standard output, and the ppmtogif filter turns it into a
GIF file that is redirected to a disk file. We now have our graph
in GIF format on disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1e54698"></a>Section 7: Displaying the Plot in a
Browser</h2></div></div><p>The final step (section 7 of Listing 1) is to display the
graph in the user's web browser. Remember this is a CGI program, so
the browser that invoked the CGI Perl script is waiting to receive
something from our web server. What we'll deliver is a brief HTML
page containing an HTML image tag that points to the GIF file we
just created.</p><p>We use the same technique, a multi-line print statement, to
create the HTML the browser will receive. Note that we must prepend
a &ldquo;content-type&rdquo; preamble to the data we send back to the
browser. This lets it know to expect an HTML page, rather than some
other type of data.</p><p>The user generates the plot by typing in the URL of the CGI
script in their browser. If the server is called
<span   class="bold"><b>myserver</b></span> and our script is saved
as <span   class="bold"><b>usage_graph_cgi</b></span> in the web
server's cgi-bin directory, then they would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://myserver/cgi-bin/usage_graph_cgi
</pre><p>To specify a date other than today, the user appends the date
to the end of the URL, separated by a question mark:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://myserver/cgi-bin/usage_graph_cgi?11/Sep/1997
</pre>


If all goes well, and there's no reason why it shouldn't, the user
should see a page that looks something like Figure 1.

our Perl program is run, so we must get rid of them when they're no
longer needed.</p><p>In my case, each night I simply run a script under crontab
that deletes any GIF files created during the day. Since most of
our applications are run during the daytime hours, the chances of
deleting a GIF file I still need are very small.</p><p>This scheme might not be acceptable in every situation, so
you may need to devise a different way to clean up the GIF files
that collect on your web server. [The
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command will fit this purpose
admirably&mdash;Ed]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1962580.0x1e54dd0"></a>Reviewing the Steps</h2></div></div><p>While I've provided a specific example of on-demand plotting,
the techniques used can be applied to any type of data you might
want to plot. If you can extract the data to a simple text file,
and if the data lends itself to two- or three-dimensional plotting,
you can deliver it to the Web. The basic steps are always the
same:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Build a text file with the data to plot.</p></li><li><p>Build a gnuplot command file.</p></li><li><p>Run gnuplot to build the plot in PPM format.</p></li><li><p>Convert the plot to GIF format using
ppmtogif.</p></li><li><p>Build an HTML page with the image tag and send it
to the browser.</p></li></ul></div><p>Tying together tools like gnuplot and NetPBM to quickly build
a useful program shows that software doesn't necessarily have to
come packaged in the latest object-oriented component, tied
together with ActiveX or CORBA. Often, good solid tools, text files
and a touch of Perl will more than suffice to do the job.</p><p><a href="2586s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
