    Mr. Elliston is working on a protocol for using SCSI devices
    to network Linux clusters in order to transfer data at high
    speeds.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf43a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I was introduced to the UNIX operating
system about seven years ago, and I soon became familiar with the
networking companion to UNIX: TCP/IP (transmission control
protocol/Internet protocol). As time progressed, I evolved from
being a user of the UNIX command-line TCP/IP utilities, i.e.,
TELNET and FTP, to gaining an understanding of the internal
workings of the protocols.
</p><p>One point, reinforced by every book on TCP/IP I have read, is
that IP was designed to be encapsulated in almost any of the
available data link protocols. This design makes it an
inter-networking protocol; it is inconsequential that a computer on
the opposite side of the globe is connected to a token ring and
your machine is connected to an Ethernet. I found this concept so
impressive that I examined the various types of existing IP
encapsulation. At the time, there was IP in IP, IP in IPX, IP in
PPP, IP over Ethernet using NCR's WaveLAN spread-spectrum network
adapters and others.</p><p>Before ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) and 100 Mbps Ethernet
were readily available, I started thinking about what other bus
networks existed for networking computers. There was ARCnet and
token ring, but these media offered throughput capacities
comparable to Ethernet. Moreover, I was interested in experimenting
with coarse-grained parallel processing using a set of cheap PCs
sitting in the same room where applications not only had to
dispatch jobs, but also exchange large data sets in order to
accomplish their tasks. In this situation, network latency was not
a great concern, but throughput was.</p><p>Perhaps due to its analogous operation to Ethernet, the SCSI
(small computer system interface) protocol popped into my head. It
was very fast&mdash;SCSI-2 adapters were commonplace at the time. SCSI
shares some attributes of Ethernet, making it suitable as a network
data link: each &ldquo;station&rdquo; has an identifier, only one &ldquo;station&rdquo;
can use the bus at any time, and each end of the bus must be
terminated with a terminator of a characteristic impedance. SCSI
provided a miniature Ethernet, only much faster.</p><p>I acquired the ANSI SCSI standards documentation and started
doing the background research that would be necessary to undertake
such a project. After a great deal of reading and advancing from
SCSI-1 to SCSI-2, I started thinking about a design which could
elegantly handle the encapsulation of IP version 4. I immediately
recognized the forthcoming issues of IP version 6, but chose to
ignore them, given that I wanted to get something running
immediately. I also reasoned that I wouldn't be doing much harm by
developing yet another protocol that would be disrupted by IP
version 6.</p><p>My design led to the RFC (Request for Comments) draft
document entitled &ldquo;IP Encapsulation over the Small Computer
Systems Interface&rdquo;, which can be found at
ftp://ftp.internic.net/rfc/rfc2143.txt.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf4660"></a>Background of SCSI</h2></div></div><p>SCSI is a peripheral interconnection technology designed to
offer hardware manufacturers a standardized protocol and hardware
description in order to build peripherals and computers which can
be interconnected. For example, the Apple Macintosh was an early
mass-produced computer which allowed the connection of SCSI
devices.</p><p>SCSI devices communicate with each other by sending data
packets across a shared bus. The device uses a hardware handshake
to acquire the bus&mdash;all other devices must be silent while another
device uses the bus. Unlike Ethernet, the bus is not accessed using
a collision detection mechanism. Instead, devices follow a stateful
algorithm to acquire the bus. When idle, the bus is in a state, or
phase, known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>bus-free phase</em></span>. If a
device wishes to access the bus, it enters an <span   class="emphasis"><em>arbitration
phase</em></span>, but only if the bus was previously in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bus-free phase</em></span>. Clearly, there exists the
classic problem in mutual exclusion where two devices check the
state of the bus, both finding it in the bus-free phase, and go
into arbitration. In this situation, the device with the highest
SCSI ID always wins. This could prove significant when designing a
network of machines running IP over SCSI.</p><p>After arbitration, the device enters a <span   class="emphasis"><em>selection
phase</em></span> in which the target SCSI device's ID is placed on
the data bus. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>command phase</em></span> is used to
transfer the command data to the target. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>reselection</em></span> phase is entered when the target
device wishes to respond to the initiator. This allows the bus to
be used by other devices while a device is performing its task. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>data-in</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>data-out</em></span>
phases are used to actually transfer data between the initiator and
the target. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>message-in</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>message-out</em></span> phases are available to transfer
additional control information between the initiator and the
target. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>status</em></span> phase is used to transfer a
status byte from the target back to the initiator to indicate the
result of the operation. For instance, a tape drive might return a
status code to indicate that the media was not loaded.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf4be0"></a>Design</h2></div></div><p>At the beginning of the project, I specified some overall
goals. These goals have had a major impact on the scope of my &ldquo;IP
over SCSI&rdquo; project. Some people found items worthy of
criticism&mdash;and on occasion, they were right. The main thing is to
realize that some of the issues raised just didn't fit the scope of
the current project. They will be addressed in a later
implementation. The goals I set were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Take a purist's approach and develop a means of
carrying IP datagrams across a SCSI bus. This means that the
limitations of SCSI such as the number of addressable stations
would have to be accepted and that larger networks would need to be
constructed using conventional strategies such as situating IP
gateways between these small SCSI networks. This has an interesting
consequence which will be discussed later.</p></li><li><p>Develop a protocol that is simple to specify and
easy to implement.</p></li><li><p>Implement the protocol within the Linux kernel as a
modular network interface (in the sense that it can be loaded and
unloaded using the kernel module tools). My reasons for using Linux
are fairly obvious: PC-based SCSI adapters are much more readily
available than SCSI adapters for any other system, and the Linux
kernel source code is freely available to study and modify.
Furthermore, most of the kernel developers are happy to correspond
via e-mail to explain chunks of source code or areas where
documentation is lacking.</p></li><li><p>Implement the network interface in such a way that
it would operate correctly regardless of the model of a SCSI host
adapter. This may introduce further performance penalties, but is
obviously desirable for most applications.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf5000"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Given these design goals, I developed a network driver which
had the following attributes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Linux SCSI mid-layer was utilized to satisfy
the requirement of interfacing to host adapters regardless of
manufacturer. This undoubtedly raises some performance issues, but
I have not yet identified them. The SCSI mid-layer does not
acknowledge the requirement to initialize a host adapter into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>target mode</em></span>, which means, unfortunately, that
every Linux low-level SCSI device driver will require modification
if it is indeed to be capable of ever supporting target mode or
supporting IP over SCSI. I have modified the Adaptec 1522 device
driver in this way, but there appears to be a lot of work involved
in modifying all of the Linux SCSI drivers.</p></li><li><p>IP datagrams can be transmitted from any SCSI host
adapter to any other host adapter. These adapters may potentially
be in the same host or, more likely, in independent hosts.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf5318"></a>Applications</h2></div></div><p>When I designed IP over SCSI, my intentions were to permit a
number of closely situated machines running Linux to communicate
using their existing base of software applications without
modification, but at much higher speeds. This has minimal value,
however, as networks such as Ethernet seem to serve most people's
needs.</p><p>Other applications, which have not yet been fully exploited,
could benefit a great deal from high-speed interconnectivity
between hosts. I was recently a witness to a demonstration of the
PVM (parallel virtual machine) manager running a massive
computation on 31 Pentium-based Linux machines, and we observed
that the bottleneck was the network used to transmit units of
&ldquo;work&rdquo; and the subsequent results between the machines.</p><p>I, therefore, see that IP over SCSI has a number of immediate
applications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A high-speed networking facility for
general-purpose applications (e.g., using it as a dedicated network
for file sharing with NFS in a research laboratory), while Ethernet
could be used for all other applications.</p></li><li><p>A means of connecting existing, closely situated
machines for high-speed applications such as FTP mirroring or Web
search engines.</p></li><li><p>Clustering and coarse-grained hypercubes
constructed using the inter-networking concept: small networks of
hosts connected via SCSI and interconnected to all other such
networks via one or more SCSI interconnections. Here, each
multi-homed host, equipped with multiple SCSI adapters, acts as an
IP gateway between the connected networks. Structures such as these
are conceivable:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">

the fact that a SCSI-1 bus, for example, is unable to support a
total of nine hosts.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afc580.0x1bf58f0"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>The encapsulation protocol for IP over SCSI has been
documented and drafted a number of times and has passed through the
Internet Engineering Task Force and is now published as a RFC
document (RFC 2143).</p><p>There has been a good deal of interest in this concept.
Another Linux user and recent computer science graduate, Randy
Scott, has implemented the IP over SCSI protocol with success. His
project does not exactly meet the protocol given in the RFC, but it
does prove that the concept works. Randy's work, however,
illustrates that there is an issue of performance when it comes to
IP networking in the Linux kernel, most of which was beyond his
control. It is understood that there is some doubt as to whether a
network interface could have a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of
64KB.</p><p>My own implementation has not been getting as much attention
from me as I would like. Until recently, work was progressing well.
I have a modular network interface which can be brought on-line
using <span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span>, and IP packets can be
sent onto the SCSI bus and the correct SCSI ID selected using my
implementation of an address resolution protocol (ARP).</p><p>The next step is to verify the modifications made to the
device driver for initializing target mode, then receive data from
the SCSI bus and pass it up the protocol stack. I would be grateful
to receive any help in completing this project from interested
individuals.</p></div></div>
