Guide to Linux</em></span> is geared to
the Linux newcomer who has some DOS and Windows experience. When
introducing new concepts or ideas, it relates them to the
DOS/Windows equivalents if possible. The tone is conversational and
relaxed, even humorous at times.
</p><p>The book is bundled with a copy of WGS Linux Pro 4.1a. This
distribution is based on Red Hat Linux 3.0.3. It comes with several
enhancements to the standard Red Hat distribution, the most notable
of which is the ability to configure and begin installation from
within DOS or Windows. Red Hat 3.0.3 is a few years old, but WGS's
philosophy (as described in the CD-ROM's README.TXT) is to use the
&ldquo;greatest, not the latest&rdquo;.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't have an opportunity to install WGS
Linux Pro. The book deals with several features unique to that
distribution, and readers who choose to install WGS Linux Pro will
get some very good, detailed help from the book. Chapter 1, for
example, gives explicit, step-by-step information to guide a new
user through the WGS Linux Pro installation process. This task is
difficult to generalize, and the advantage of bundling a specific
Linux distribution is evident here. This is in pleasant contrast to
some other books I've read where the accompanying CD-ROM seems to
be more of an afterthought than a companion to the book.</p><p>The book is divided into chapters, each focusing closely on
an area of Linux. A typical chapter provides an introduction to a
topic, followed by a summary and exploration of tools associated
with the topic, and concludes with a pointer to more information
on-line or in print.</p><p>Chapter 3 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The No B.S Guide to Linux</em></span>
covers the requisite introduction to fundamental UNIX concepts such
as the hierarchal file system and file name case sensitivity. It
also details shell features such as command-line completion, wild
cards, pipes and process control.</p><p>Chapter 4 introduces a loose collection of utilities useful
in the everyday operation of a Linux system. Most of the commands
discussed don't have much in common. The chapter covers file and
directory manipulation, printing, job scheduling with
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span>, printer setup and usage, user
listings, examples of the find command and several other
indispensable utilities.</p><p>There is a cursory look at three text editors (vi, Emacs and
pico) in Chapter 5. Although the chapter is fairly short, it gives
enough of an introduction to these editors to give you the ability
to open a file, navigate through it, make any necessary changes and
save it.</p><p>The X Window System is discussed in Chapter 7, but only
briefly. The chapter provides a working knowledge of how to start
X, how to launch some common clients, and how to do some simple
customizations. A few more X applications are mentioned in Chapter
11, which discusses the Internet and some popular clients for
accessing it. Chapter 7 concludes with what seems to be a slightly
out-of-place discussion on shareware, freeware, commercial Linux
applications and their locations.</p><p>The chapter on programming, disappointingly, breezes through
what is one of Linux's most attractive points. A wealth of
programming tools are available for Linux, but the author covers
only the shell in depth. However, this is in line with a target
audience of DOS/Windows users, who may not be interested in using
Linux as a development environment. A few web sites are provided
for those who wish to further explore other languages.</p><p>A few chapters I haven't mentioned in detail. They cover
things from text file manipulation using pipelines of shell
commands, to connecting to the Internet and sending e-mail, as well
as other topics. In addition, the appendices provide an exhaustive
list of the contents of the CD-ROM, the Linux Hardware
Compatibility HOWTO and the GNU General Public License.</p><p>Someone looking for a weighty reference book won't find it in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The No B.S. Guide to Linux</em></span>. What you will
find, however, is a readable, thorough and, at times, entertaining
introduction to Linux. Although it is a little shallow for the more
technically minded, it is well suited to someone apprehensive of
being overwhelmed by a totally new operating system. It does a very
good job of taking a potentially dry subject and making it
interesting and understandable.</p></div></div>
