Retransmit from a radio scanner to the Internet via Ices and Icecast.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2798580.0x2890240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Sioux Empire Amateur Radio Club operates a repeater on 146.895MHz
with the call name W0ZWY. On Tuesday evenings, it provides a time for club
announcements. I like to listen in when I can, but sometimes I am still
at work when the announcements start and can't get to my radio. I found
a way to solve this problem by using a UHF/VHF scanner, Linux, Ices and
Icecast. By rebroadcasting the transmission over the Internet, I can
listen to the local club repeater anytime, anywhere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2798580.0x28903f8"></a>
Tuning In</h2></div></div><p>
The first step was to find a VHF tuner that could tune to 146.895MHz and
output analog audio to a sound card. I found that the least expensive
way to go was to buy a consumer-grade UHF/VHF scanner. The scanner
needed to have either a line-level output or a headphone jack. I found
that line-level outputs are rare, but there are a number of scanners
with headphone jacks. I also wanted one with a digital tuner so that it
would not drift off frequency over time. I found a Radio Shack PRO-2050
on eBay for around $75 US that met all my requirements.
</p><p>
Using an F-to-BNC adapter, I connected the scanner's antenna jack to
the off-air TV antenna on the roof of my house. This worked well because
146.895MHz lies right between off-air TV channels 6 and 7. I spent some
time setting the squelch as high as I could, so there would not be
static when no one was transmitting. Figure 1 shows my scanner with the
audio cable plugged in to the headphone jack.

Getting Connected</h2></div></div><p>
In order to put the audio on the Internet, it first must be encoded.
Then,
that encoded information can be made available for streaming to clients on
the Internet. For these tasks, Icecast and Ices make a great team. Icecast
is a media streaming program that supports Ogg Vorbis or MP3
streams. It
receives encoded media from one or more sources and makes it available for
streaming to multiple clients. Ices is an Ogg Vorbis audio encoder that
works well with Icecast. I chose Ogg because it is a patent- and royalty-free format. Plenty of players can decode Ogg. XMMS on
Linux and Winamp on Windows are the most common. If you are interested
in using MP3 encoding, check out LiveIce by following the link in 
the Resources for this article.
</p><p>
The encoding and streaming tasks can be done on the same machine, but I
chose to do them on separate machines. This makes it easier to add more
sources later. Additionally, it removes some of the processing burden
from the streaming machine.
</p><p>
For the encoding computer, I chose a 233MHz Pentium I computer that had
been unused for many years. I connected the headphone jack from the
scanner to the line-in jack on the sound card using a 3.5mm-to-3.5mm
audio cable that came from an old set of computer speakers. I connected
the network interface to my LAN and set the IP address to 192.168.1.21.
</p><p>
For the streaming computer, I chose to use my existing router, which
doubles as a Web server. The main reasons I chose it are that I already
own it and it has my only public IP address. This computer has two
network interfaces. One is connected to my cable modem and has a public IP
address. The other interface is connected to my LAN and has the private
IP address 192.168.1.1. Another way to accomplish this would be to use
a consumer-grade cable/DSL router and forward port 8000 to the streaming
computer's IP address.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows a diagram of my network, including the scanner, encoder,
streamer and cable modem.

Icecast Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
My streaming computer is running Mandriva. Icecast is available from
Mandriva's contrib RPM repository. Once I added that repository,
installing Icecast was as easy as typing <tt  >urpmi
icecast</tt> from the command
prompt. If you want to install from source, you can download the latest
release from the Icecast Web site (see Resources). Simply click the
download link, extract the archive, and run the familiar commands
<tt  >./configure; make; make install</tt>.
</p><p>
The Icecast configuration file is an XML file and usually resides in
/etc/icecast.xml. I was able to use most of the default settings, but
I highlight some of the changes I did make here.
</p><p>
The limits section of the file allows you to set the maximum number
of source streams (encoders) and the maximum number of clients that can
connect to the streaming computer at once. The upload data rate on my
cable modem is limited to 256Kbps by my ISP. As such, I need to limit
the maximum number of clients to be sure that I don't use all of my
upload bandwidth:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;limits&gt;
    &lt;clients&gt;10&lt;/clients&gt;
    &lt;sources&gt;2&lt;/sources&gt;
&lt;/limits&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The authentication section is where you specify the user names and
passwords. The source-password is the password used by the encoding
machine when it connects. The relay-password is used by relays, which I
am not using in my configuration. The admin-user and admin-password
allow access to the administration Web page. It is important to change
all passwords from the default for security:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;authentication&gt;
    &lt;source-password&gt;hackme&lt;/source-password&gt;
    &lt;relay-password&gt;hackme&lt;/relay-password&gt;
    &lt;admin-user&gt;admin&lt;/admin-user&gt;
    &lt;admin-password&gt;hackme&lt;/admin-password&gt;
&lt;/authentication&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The hostname is used so that Icecast knows what address to append to
the beginning of the links on the Web page:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;hostname&gt;example.com&lt;/hostname&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The listen-socket allows you to set the port on which Icecast listens;
8000 is the default:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;listen-socket&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;8000&lt;/port&gt;
&lt;/listen-socket&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Once the configuration file is all ready, you can start Icecast by running
the init script: <tt  >/etc/init.d/icecast start</tt>. If there are any errors
during startup, look in the log files to debug them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2798580.0x2891108"></a>
Ices Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
My encoding computer is also running Mandriva. Because this machine
is running only at 233MHz with 64MB of RAM, I decided to do a minimal
install and leave off the window manager. Ices is also available from the
contrib repository. So once again, typing <tt  >urpmi
ices</tt> is all it took
to install Ices. However, you can download the latest releases from the Ices
Web site (see Resources). Make sure you use the 2.0 series if you want to
use Ogg. It also requires that libshout is installed. Once you have that,
you can extract the archive and run <tt  >./configure; make; make
install</tt>
to get everything installed.
</p><p>
The Ices configuration file is also an XML file. It is usually stored
in /etc/ices.conf.
</p><p>
The beginning of the configuration file has some settings that dictate
how Ices runs. It can be helpful to change these during the initial
setup, so
that Ices runs in the foreground and sends messages to the console. These
messages can be very helpful in debugging problems on initial setup. Once
everything is set up and running, make sure Ices runs
in the background and logs messages to a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;background&gt;1&lt;/background&gt;
&lt;logpath&gt;/var/log/ices&lt;/logpath&gt;
&lt;logfile&gt;ices.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
&lt;loglevel&gt;3&lt;/loglevel&gt;
&lt;consolelog&gt;0&lt;/consolelog&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The rest of the file is under the stream section. This is where you
configure settings specific to this particular audio stream. Within the
stream section, the metadata section is where you specify information
about the stream. This information will be displayed on the Icecast
Web page:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;metadata&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;W0ZWY 146.895 MHz&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;genre&gt;Live&lt;/genre&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Live feed of the 
        W0ZWY repeater&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The input section is the place to define where the audio actually comes
from. There are many possibilities, including options for playlists and
scripts. Because I want to encode live audio, I used the oss module. Don't be
alarmed if your system uses the ALSA sound system instead of OSS. ALSA
has OSS compatibility, so this module works with both ALSA and
OSS. Use the device parameter to specify the sound device from which to get data. On most systems it will be /dev/dsp. The rate parameter specifies
the sample rate of the data in hertz. Most devices use 44100. Use the
channels parameter to specify the number of channels available for
capture. For most devices this will be 2 (stereo):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;input&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;oss&lt;/module&gt;
    &lt;param name='device'&gt;/dev/dsp&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name='rate'&gt;44100&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name='channels'&gt;2&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/input&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The instance section allows you to specify the number of instances of
this stream. You might have more than one instance if you want to send
the stream to more than one server, or if you want to have different
versions of the same stream at different bitrates. For my system, I 
want only one instance.
</p><p>
The first part of the instance section is where you specify the
streaming server information. The hostname tells Ices where to send the
data. The port and password must match the values you specified in the
Icecast configuration file. The mount option specifies what the name
of the stream will be called.
</p><p>
The encode section specifies how the audio will be encoded. The easy way
to do it is to set the sample rate and channels to match the input
section above. But, I didn't need that much quality for my stream. So,
I used the downmix and resample sections to tell Ices to resample
the audio to 11127Hz and downmix it to 1 channel (mono). There are two
options you can use to adjust the final bitrate of the stream: quality
and nominal-bitrate. Notice that I commented out nominal-bitrate
and set quality to 2:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;instance&gt;
    &lt;hostname&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/hostname&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;8000&lt;/port&gt;
    &lt;password&gt;hackme&lt;/password&gt;
    &lt;mount&gt;/146.895.ogg&lt;/mount&gt;

    &lt;encode&gt;
        &lt;quality&gt;2&lt;/quality&gt;
        &lt;!--nominal-bitrate&gt;32000&lt;/nominal-bitrate--&gt;
        &lt;samplerate&gt;11127&lt;/samplerate&gt;
        &lt;channels&gt;1&lt;/channels&gt;
    &lt;/encode&gt;

    &lt;downmix&gt;1&lt;/downmix&gt;

    &lt;resample&gt;
        &lt;in-rate&gt;44100&lt;/in-rate&gt;
        &lt;out-rate&gt;11127&lt;/out-rate&gt;
    &lt;/resample&gt;
&lt;/instance&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Once the configuration file is all ready, make sure that Ices
has permission to access the audio device through /dev/dsp. Mandriva
creates an audio group, which owns the /dev/dsp file. It also creates
an ices user and group when ices is installed. I simply added ices
as a member of the audio group in the /etc/groups file by editing the
audio group:

<pre     class="programlisting">
audio:x:81:ices
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you can start Ices by running the init script: <tt  >/etc/init.d/ices
start</tt>. If there are any errors during startup, look in the log files to
debug them. It also can be helpful to examine the Icecast log files
on your streaming computer to debug problems.
</p><p>
Once everything is up and running, you can access the Icecast status page
on the port you specified in the configuration file. Figure 3 shows an
example of an Icecast status page. Clicking on Click to Listen 
launches your audio player.

Fine-Tuning</h2></div></div><p>
Once I had everything set up and running, I spent a fair amount of time
fine-tuning the audio. The first thing I found was that the audio level
was quite low. Normally, when I want to turn up the audio level, I use
KMix. But, I hadn't installed a window manager on my encoding computer. My
system uses ALSA as the sound system, and I found out that there is a
great curses-based mixer for ALSA named Alsamixer. It allows you to use
the arrow keys to change settings. Figure 4 shows the settings I chose
for my card. My final preference was to have the Master and PCM both at
100%. I also chose to mute everything else, because I knew they would not
be in use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9280f4.large.jpg"><img src="9280f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Alsamixer Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Now that the audio was loud enough, I still had another problem. The
audio sounded choppy. After looking around for a while, I realized
that the processor usage was at 100%. I tried to reduce the bitrate by
changing the value of the nominal-bitrate setting. With the bitrate
set sufficiently low, the audio sounded good. I guess you can't encode
very high-quality audio with a 233MHz processor.
</p><p>
When the audio sounded good, my goal was to lower the bitrate as much as
possible while keeping an acceptable level of audio quality. In my case,
an &ldquo;acceptable level&rdquo; is quite low. The traffic on the W0ZWY repeater
is only voice, because it is illegal to transmit music in the amateur
radio bands.
</p><p>
Three aspects of the encoded audio will affect its quality
and bitrate: number of channels, sample rate and bitrate. I started
by setting the downmix to 1, because the scanner is only mono. Then,
I incrementally decreased the sample rate until I found the lowest
setting that rendered acceptable audio; 11127Hz ended up being the
minimum. Instead of setting the bitrate with the nominal-bitrate
setting, I used the quality setting. The quality setting directly
affects the final bitrate. With a few tries, I chose a quality level of 2.
</p><p>
With my final settings, the bitrate stays around 30Kbps, and the processor
hovers around 40% usage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2798580.0x2c8a0c0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There are probably many other applications where this type of system
would be useful. Keep in mind, however, if you are interested in using
this type of system for streaming music, make sure you have
permission from the artists and recording studios.
</p><p>
This combination of open-source projects really worked well
together. Setting up everything was quite simple. I spent most of
my time tweaking the quality and sample rate settings. The traffic on my
streamer is quite low. I usually have only one or two connections per
week. But, it was fun to learn, and it is my little way of participating
in the amateur radio community.
