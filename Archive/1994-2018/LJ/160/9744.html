We at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> have taken a dim view of the Microsoft/Novell deal and
Microsoft's attempts to monetize the work of the Open Source community by
offering covenants not to sue. However, in an effort to remain fair and
balanced in our coverage of these controversial issues, we are publishing
the following testimonial from a happy Microsoft customer who wishes to
remain anonymous because he doesn't exist.
</p><p>
Dear <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Editor,
</p><p>
I must take issue with the negative stance <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> has adopted with
respect to Microsoft software patents, licensing and covenants not to
sue. Our company represents one of the customers to whom Microsoft Senior
Vice President Bob Muglia refers when he says, &ldquo;Customers have indicated
to us that it's problematic to them that when they work with open-source
software, they don't have similar intellectual property protection.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I find this to be so true. Our company simply could not adopt open-source software without intellectual property protection. Open source
represented a grave liability to us because no company claimed control
over it. Put simply, how could we have confidence that someone would not
sue us for using Linux unless we paid someone not to sue? We were anxious
to pay protection money to solve this problem, but to whom would we pay
it? We would gladly have paid Red Hat, but Red Hat did not threaten to
sue us, so what would be the point? That's the problem with Linux. It
is not owned by a single entity with the power to license protection,
and those who distribute it are remiss in threatening to sue in order
to make intellectual property protection available to paying customers.
</p><p>
We feel Linux advocates and developers should be grateful that Microsoft
stepped up to the plate in this regard. Now that Microsoft has graciously
offered to solve this dilemma for us by threatening to sue us for using
Linux, we have finally found a reason to adopt Linux and open source. We
now know where to send our protection money.
</p><p>
Technically speaking, SCO was the first to offer us a covenant not
to sue, and we were almost ready to adopt Linux in a big way when SCO
provided us this option. We backed away when IBM and Novell tried to
make it difficult for SCO to follow through. Why? IBM is much bigger
than SCO. If IBM created enough trouble to put SCO out of business,
it would set us back to square one, without anyone to pay protection
money. This was a risk we were not willing to accept.
</p><p>
Then Microsoft approached us behind the scenes and offered us a sweet
deal. We agreed to pay Microsoft $20 for every copy of Linux we would
install, in return for which Microsoft promised not to sue us for $400 per
copy throughout the terms of the agreement. This deal not only provided
us with the intellectual property protection we customers demand, as
noted by Bob Muglia, it also saves us $380 per copy of Linux until the
agreement expires! Think of it. Even if we deploy only 1,000 copies of
Linux, that's a $380,000 savings. With an economic incentive like that,
how can anyone question Microsoft's commitment to the open-source model?
</p><p>
This is not the first time Microsoft volunteered to assist us with
intellectual property protection. Some years ago, Microsoft conducted an
audit of our Windows and Office licenses, which brought to our attention
the fact that we had not organized and stored our product licenses
properly. Microsoft solved our problem easily by selling us all the
replacement licenses we needed. It may seem unreasonable to some people
to pay twice for the same software, but we beg to differ. We think of
it as paying not for software, but for peace of mind, which is what
intellectual property protection is all about.
</p><p>
Some like-minded customers advised us to adopt SUSE Linux, as it is
covered under the Microsoft/Novell covenant not to sue. We consider this
an acceptable option, but not the ideal one. It is much more effective
to deal directly with the threatening party.
</p><p>
Think of it this way. Our regular fire insurance covers accidental
fires. We've had two accidental warehouse fires (minor ones, thankfully)
since we bought the policy. In what way did our insurance protect
us against accidental fires? It didn't help at all. In contrast, we
donate money in a manila envelope each month to another
&ldquo;insurance&rdquo;
company who has sworn to protect us against arson. Since we started
making those payments, we've seen a 100% reduction in fires caused by
arson. You can't argue with that kind of success, and it's all because
we deal directly with the source of arson fires.
</p><p>
I hope this testimony has opened your eyes at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. It's not
too late for you to secure your own intellectual property protection.
