No Agape for Latin</h4><p>
Agape is not Latin. It is Greek. What does this say about the rest of
his article? [See Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall's Beachhead in the June
2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.]
</p><p>
&mdash;Tobin
</p><p>
Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall's heart was in the right place, but his research was
defective. Agape is Greek, not Latin. I submit this small criticism in
the highest sense of the word.
</p><p>
&mdash;Daryl
</p><p>
A note for Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall: I was always taught (and Wikipedia confirms)
that agape is of Greek origin, not Latin. Otherwise, it was an
interesting stroll down memory lane. What gives?
</p><p>
&mdash;John E. Young
</p><p>
Maddog, I enjoyed your article, but I almost didn't make it past the second
paragraph; agape is a transliteration from Greek not Latin&mdash;a compiler
error I presume.
</p><p>
I can assure you assembly language is still kicking&mdash;the last assembly
language (IBM 360 type, now z/Arch type) program I wrote was yesterday.
</p><p>
&mdash;Richard Pace
</p><p>
One can only hope that Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall learned his programming
languages better than he learned his Latin. In his June 2007
column, he says that he named his boat <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span> from the Latin word
meaning &ldquo;the highest form of love&rdquo;. The word agape is not Latin,
as Hall suggests, but Greek, and being one of several Classical Greek
words for different types of love, it generally is understood to mean
something like &ldquo;brotherly love&rdquo; or charity. Maybe maddog needs to debug
his Latin.
</p><p>
&mdash;Max E. Klinger
</p><p>
The origin of the word agape is Greek, but Latin assimilated it. As Jon's
teacher taught Latin, not Greek, she was correct in teaching agape as a
Latin word. One other note: agape is often translated as charity, but
philia is the Greek for brotherly love.&mdash;Ed.

More FORTRAN before Interface</h4><p>
A heartfelt thanks to Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall for both his article on
languages in the June 2007 issue and his dedication of that issue to
John Backus. While my career diverges wildly on details from Jon's,
there was enough commonality to draw a hearty &ldquo;Amen, Brother
Jon&rdquo; at
the end of his column. I also started with FORTRAN II (on CDC Big
Iron) in the late 1960s as an astronomy student, and was drawn into a
computer systems class that was mostly a class on CDC's assembly
language and CDC computer architecture. Knowing how all those 0s and
1s work together to get all that hardware to do what you want is
definitely an essential knowledge to anyone writing serious code.
I've not written anything at the machine level in decades, but, as
Jon said, what I learned in programming &ldquo;kindergarten&rdquo; is in the back
of my mind any time I write any code, be it in FORTAN (still my
primary language), Java, PostScript, Python or whatever language I
need to use.

Never Fight a Land War in Asia</h4><p>
First off, love the magazine. I look forward to each issue even with a
large portion of it being over my head.
</p><p>
I often spend time telling people of the merits of Linux and that we are
winning&mdash;much like Doc Searls' &ldquo;Picking New Fights&rdquo;
article in the June 2007
issue. But I never fail to run into the standard, &ldquo;what about obscure
hardware or newer hardware that doesn't run on Linux? With Windows, it
just works.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I then have to explain that, no, it doesn't &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. The
manufacturers simply write drivers under Windows, and if they would get
pressure to write for Linux, it would &ldquo;just work&rdquo; there as well. Our
answer is that the manufacturers are the ones that should spend time
testing for compatibility. That would, in turn, also free up Linux
programmers to write other useful stuff.
</p><p>
Nick Petreley, in /var/opinion [June 2007], fell victim to one of the classic
blunders. The first of which is never get involved in a land war in
Asia. The second, which is only slightly less known, is never go in
against a Sicilian when death is on the line, and the third (even slightlier 
less known) is always blame the manufacturer for incompatibility.
</p><p>
We blame ATI for crummy Linux drivers, and not Linux itself, right?
ATI, the manufacturer, we say, should be responsible for basic support and
contribution to the Linux community to support its hardware, correct?
So why doesn't jEdit create an Ubuntu package and submit it?
</p><p>
I realize it wasn't a specific complaint against Ubuntu, but the same
assumption is there&mdash;that it's Ubuntu's responsibility to go out and do
the legwork. Better yet, how about Nick making an Ubuntu package and
submitting it?
</p><p>
You guys are great. I just wanted to share with you my initial
impression. I know that one day everything will hopefully just gel
together. If you have a program you like, ask to make it available
for your favorite distro, etc.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kermit Jones  <br><br>
</p><p>
I love the references to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Princess Bride</em></span>, thanks. If I had time to create
packages for Ubuntu, I would.&mdash;Ed.

To Doc from Doc</h4><p>
I just read your June 2007 column and felt compelled to write about a
few issues. [See Doc Searls' &ldquo;Picking New Fights&rdquo;.]
</p><p>
I am a Chiropractor, running a small office in Sandy, Utah. 
Perhaps I have overlooked the buzz of Linux enthusiasts coding for
healthcare projects. Any ideas on this? 
</p><p>
Another area I find lacking...is small business. I am a regular in several channels on
irc.freenode.net as bonez39, in #utah and #debian. I have many friends
there, who are talented coders, well versed in Linux and a host of
tools and languages. Where it becomes disheartening for me, running a small
business, is when I seek out other small business owners, in such
channels.
</p><p>
It seems that I find only programmer/coder types, and further, it seems
that people running small businesses are too busy running the business to mingle
in such groups. Do you know of any groups devoted to small-business owners, who
also hope to run things efficiently and effectively with Linux?
</p><p>
Amen to the fight against the telcos. I recently switched over at my
office from Qwest, where 1.5 was the maximum rate for broadband, up to 4+Mb with
Comcast. This is at the base business rate, so I can keep my overhead
down. 
</p><p>
What can I, as one business owner, do to motivate patients, friends and
family to further the open mobile and freedom movement with telcos?
</p><p>
You've got a new devoted reader here! Thanks for a great piece this
month.

I Never Metaprogramming I Didn't Like</h4><p>
I was really pleased to see the article on metaprogramming in the
June 2007 issue. [See Ariel Ortiz's &ldquo;An Introduction to
Metaprogramming&rdquo;.] After more than a decade of writing Fortran programs that
write PostScript programs, and shell scripts that write Fortran, and awk
scripts that make the PostScript frames that a shell script turns into a
GIF animation, I finally came across the word metaprogramming a couple
of years ago. Certainly a major motivation for this kind of work is to
make the machine produce the boilerplate for some programming language.
I liked the article, but I was surprised to see bash ignored, except
for an oblique mention that &ldquo;Some languages have a facility called
eval.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Finally, after all the interesting articles, there's Nick Petreley's
opinion column. Is it just me, or has <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> become a lot more interesting
since he took the helm? Thanks to you all, in any case.

Who Owns OpenGL?</h4><p>
In the editor's comment to the &ldquo;Miniature OpenGL Development
System&rdquo; letter in the June 2007 issue, you claim that &ldquo;Microsoft
owns the patent to OpenGL&rdquo;.
</p><p>
That is not true, and it's a bad example of spreading FUD that I wouldn't have
expected from you.
</p><p>
Microsoft bought some patents from Silicon Graphics in 2002 that may be
applicable to parts of OpenGL. (And very little has ever surfaced
again, but then again, with patents you never know.)


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ulrich Hertlein  <br><br>
</p><p>
I sit partially corrected. Microsoft has staked claims on important
portions of OpenGL, not the entire thing.&mdash;Ed.
