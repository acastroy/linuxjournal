<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #160, August 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> recently said that the
whole <span   class="bold"><b>software suspend</b></span> debate between
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek's swsusp</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Nigel Cunningham's suspend2</b></span> was entirely
misguided. Linus said he no longer has faith that either project can
succeed. His hope now, he said, was that some new person would step in and
take the whole concept in an entirely new direction. He also said that he
believes software suspend is indeed a kernel issue and not something that
should be entirely in user space. If he finds a solution he likes, he'll
incorporate it into the kernel.
</p><p>
It also seems that Linus himself has solved some of the basic development
issues, and various people are now telling him his ideas are crazy.
Typically when this happens, folks will hurl insults at Linus for weeks or
months, while he'll just continue to explain his ideas. Eventually, some kind
of tipping point is reached, and a general perspective shift occurs. At this
point, one or more folks will rush off to code up the new idea.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Hourihane</b></span> of <span   class="bold"><b>Tungsten Graphics</b></span> has been working on an <span   class="bold"><b>FBDev driver</b></span> for
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel's LE80578 chipset</b></span>. Intel actually
had been funding the work through
Tungsten, and Alan posted his code recently to the linux-kernel mailing
list. In response to various technical suggestions, Alan also posted updated
patches addressing those issues&mdash;typically a sign that a piece of code is
likely to be included in the official kernel sooner rather than later.
</p><p>
The question of what will become of the <span   class="bold"><b>Reiser4
filesystem</b></span> is still open.
It could be adopted into the official kernel; it could transform from a
primarily corporate project to a primarily volunteer one; it could become
unmaintained and disappear completely. There are many possibilities. But, the
fact of Hans Reiser's murder trial does not change most of the issues
surrounding whether to include the code in the kernel.
</p><p>
One thing holding the project back is that kernel developers are still
reluctant to give significant feedback on the code. Hans' habit of
rejecting all commentary and engaging in ad hominem attacks on the
commentators has left a mark that even his absence on murder charges has not
eroded. A lot of folks who had put in a significant amount of time on giving
analysis of Reiser4 code simply have moved on to other projects, and no one
has arisen to take their place.
</p><p>
Without reviewers, the likelihood of Reiser4 going into the kernel
diminishes greatly. A number of relatively large technical issues are
standing in the way of inclusion, and reviews by kernel developers were one
of the key ways the Reiser4 developers could understand those issues.
</p><p>
It seems possible that <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> might try to jump-start some kind of
<span   class="bold"><b>review process</b></span> by accepting the patches into his -mm tree, with the implied
threat/promise of submitting them to Linus Torvalds. This would certainly
have a number of kernel developers up in arms and cause them to take a much closer look
at the code. But, it also is a fairly drastic measure for Andrew to take.
</p><p>
It's also possible that any sort of review process might take too long.
The <span   class="bold"><b>Namesys engineers</b></span> who maintain Reiser4 are having to confront a
diminishing amount of funds available to support the project. At least one
Namesys engineer, <span   class="bold"><b>Edward Shishkin</b></span>, has said he would still devote about 25%
of his time to Reiser4 on a volunteer basis if his employment at Namesys
went away.
</p><p>
As usually happens when issues like these are brought out in the
open, recent discussions on linux-kernel have resulted in several folks
showing interest in reviewing the Reiser4 code. None of the reviewers from
the old days seem very interested, but maybe this new set of reviewers will
be able to provide enough commentary to smooth the path a little bit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> continues his long-standing efforts to clean up the kernel. A
lot of kernel code hangs around in the kernel for a long time, even after a
better alternative comes along, and even when that better alternative makes its
way into the official source tree.
</p><p>
In the current case, <span   class="bold"><b>X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ</b></span> is the new code, allowing users to
change the clock speed of their CPUs on the fly, which can amount to a large
power savings. The old code, X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI, has been
deprecated for a long time, and now its time has come.
</p><p>
Adrian posted a patch removing the older code, and there was a small bit of
discussion&mdash;whether to include the patch in 2.6.21 or 2.6.22, and how to
communicate the change to users who might rely on the older code.
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill
Davidsen</b></span> was particularly worried about this latter possibility, until
Adrian reminded him that the older code had been marked as deprecated for a
long time, and the feature-removal-schedule.txt file contained a clear
explanation of the replacement.

<h2 class="title">JavaFX Mobile: It Only Starts with the Phones</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #160, August 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
First there was the Qtopia Greenphone
(<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/greenphone" target="_self">www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/greenphone</a>) from
Trolltech: &ldquo;a
Linux mobile development device open for unlimited software
innovation&rdquo;. Then there was OpenMoko
(<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Introduction" target="_self">wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Introduction</a>): &ldquo;the world's first
integrated open-source mobile communications platform&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now there's JavaFX Mobile: &ldquo;a complete mobile operating and application
environment built around Java and Linux open-source technologies&rdquo;. Not
coincidentally, the phone Sun used to demonstrate JavaFX Mobile at
JavaOne in May 2007 was the OpenMoko design (known as Neo1973) that we
covered in the February 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
Sun and Java have been around the cell-phone business for a long time.
And, the platform has come a long way since the time I joked to Sun CEO
Jonathan Schwartz that Java to me was &ldquo;the logo I had to stare at for
16 seconds after I hit the wrong button on my cell phone&rdquo;.
</p><p>
But, this is a huge new move, for five reasons. First, Java is being
GPL'd (which was the cover story of our June 2007 issue). Second, Sun wants
to fill the world with mobile phones that are open to development by
players other than the phone builders and their carrier partners. Third,
Sun actually has clout with phone makers. Fourth, it's not stopping
at phones, but looking to put this in all kinds of embedded devices.
Fifth, but hardly last, Schwartz &amp; Co. have a bone to pick with Steve
Jobs, who has dissed Java while getting huge PR for Apple's new (and
closed) iPhone.
</p><p>
There are lots of dots to connect here.
</p><p>
There's SavaJe, the source of the code base for JavaFX Mobile, recently
acquired by Sun. There are connections between SavaJe and longtime Linux
hardware developer Tadpole Technology.
</p><p>
There's Ed Zander, the Motorola CEO who used to be Sun's President and
CEO, and who can't be happy to have seen Motorola's phone
&ldquo;partnership&rdquo;
with Apple go south. Would Motorola be willing to go zig in the open
direction while Apple zags in the closed? Good chance.
</p><p>
There's Eric Schmidt, the former Java development chief at Sun who is
now CEO of Google. He's on Apple's board, but still, it's a connection.
</p><p>
Then, there's what Jonathan Schwartz says on his blog
(<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/when_not_where" target="_self">blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/when_not_where</a>): he wants the
world to have an open platform that allows &ldquo;any consumer electronics
manufacturer to accelerate the delivery of Java/Linux-based devices,
from phones to set tops and dashboards and everything else imaginable,
without fear of format lock-in or disintermediation from a
competitor&rdquo;.
All this from &ldquo;a company with no agenda to disintermediate content owners and every interest in propelling the Open Source community (every
portion of the content Sun contributes to the JavaFX product and
community will be via the GPL license, at the core of Java and
GNU/Linux)&rdquo;.
</p><p>
He also wants this to make phones cheap as well as open, to &ldquo;play a
central role in bringing the Internet to the planet&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;be the
software to build the devices to bridge the digital
divide&rdquo;&mdash;like the
One Laptop Per Child, only half the price or less.
</p><p>
Encouraging stuff. It'll be interesting to see what happens.

Support open spectrum. Demand real competition. Ask for investigations
of past spectrum auctions and the return of frequencies obtained
through fraud. Demand that systems be built-out. It will take political
pressure to create the kind of competitive wireless market in which
something like a $30 Internet phone can be made available. Time to bring
it.

<h2 class="title">Thin Clients Rock</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #160, August 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When you introduce Linux to a group of people unfamiliar with the
idea, it's a lot like giving cough syrup to a five-year-old. Average
users tend to lose sight of the things Linux can do for them and
focus on the rough edges. As Linux &ldquo;people&rdquo;, our job is often just as
political as it is technical, because let's face it, the software is
generally the easiest part of the equation.
</p><p>
In 2003, Michigan's educational funding started a downward trend that
continues into present day (2007). Every school in our state feels
it, and every school is competing to keep students. In an unfortunate
twist, 2003 also was the year we needed to change our student
management system from our old, now defunct, Macintosh-based system to
a Microsoft Windows-based solution. My suggested method to accomplish
that was Linux&mdash;specifically, Linux thin clients.
</p><p>
I created a menu of proposals for the school board. One described the
cost to switch entirely to a Microsoft-based infrastructure. This
included workstations, servers, licensing, staff training and
additional third-party needs, such as antivirus software and Microsoft Office. The
other option required purchasing a handful of servers and using
donated computers as thin clients. We would base the system on the
Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP). The first proposal came in at about
$500,000 for the first year, and the latter came in at about $150,000.
 I didn't have to do much more selling&mdash;&ldquo;Linux&rdquo; was the school
board's new favorite word.
</p><p>
It's important to note that I easily could have quoted the cost at
$50,000 and still had a functional network. One of the biggest
mistakes we as OSS advocates make is not spending enough money. Don't
scrimp on hardware when you are saving so much on software. It's
important to find a balance between savings and functionality. For
example, the bare minimum I needed to convert our district to thin-client technology was:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A fast LTSP server per 50&ndash;75 thin clients to handle the booting.
</p></li><li><p>
A Windows Terminal Server and appropriate licensing.
</p></li><li><p>
Actual thin clients (we were a Macintosh school, and at that point,
old Mac hardware couldn't be used for thin clients, so we had to
acquire new ones).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, my quote also included the following additional purchases:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Two more fast servers to support additional thin clients and/or load
balancing.
</p></li><li><p>
A complete network upgrade (switches and so on) to a 1Gb backbone.
</p></li><li><p>
Microsoft Office licenses to ease the transition to OSS for naysayers.
</p></li><li><p>
New 17" monitors instead of recycled 15" monitors.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The board approved the transition to Linux. We ordered the hardware and
jumped feet first into an exciting summer.
</p><p>
LTSP is a system that works on top of basically any Linux
distribution. I've always been rather fond of Debian, but for this
huge install, I wanted to use something that had been tried and
tested. The folks over at K12LTSP have taken Fedora and created an
installer that integrates LTSP and scores of tweaks that really make
the thin clients shine. The support from their mailing list is
usually quick and always provides more help than any phone support I've ever
used. In fact, the developers usually are available in real time on
IRC if you have a mission-critical question. Unless you have a real
aversion to Fedora-based distributions, there's really not any good
reason to go elsewhere.
</p><p>
One of the more difficult parts of implementing a wide-scale thin-client rollout is to estimate server requirements. There is no simple
way to determine how many thin clients a given server can handle. The
requirements vary enormously depending on the applications that will
run from the thin clients. A best guideline, based on discussion with
the LTSP developers, is the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Get the fastest processors you can afford. Dual/quad is better than single.
</p></li><li><p>
Hard drives, as long as file storage is done remotely, really don't
have to be super fast.
</p></li><li><p>
Reserve 512MB of RAM for the server and 100MB per thin client.
</p></li><li><p>
50 clients is a lot on a server. For more than that, consider
multiple servers.
</p></li><li><p>
Gigabit Ethernet on a switched network is a must. Dual gigabit is better.
</p></li><li><p>
File serving for a large network is best done from a separate NFS
server, which has the fastest drives you can afford.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Following those guidelines, I figured in order to support the 75 thin
clients I needed, I should get three LTSP servers, one file server and
one Windows Terminal Server (for the Windows application we needed).
</p><p>
During the installation, one of my biggest worries was not having enough
horsepower to run all the thin clients. The first concern was network
bandwidth. We did purchase new switches throughout the district, but
I wasn't familiar with Ethernet channel bonding, and I didn't want to
experiment with the idea on the first day of school. I decided to
split the network traffic into two segments. All traffic between the
LTSP servers and the thin clients traveled over eth0 on our main
network, and all file transfers between the LTSP servers and the NFS
server flowed through a separate, gigabit switch over eth1. That
effectively isolated the two main bandwidth usages and avoided the need
for channel bonding. The solution was very effective.
</p><p>
I was still concerned about the performance issue and didn't want my
ignorance to make LTSP or Linux look bad on day one. To make sure
bandwidth and processor usage wouldn't be a problem, I decided to
give the users a <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> spartan desktop when they logged in. The
software I chose for a minimalistic Linux experience was:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
XDM as the login manager, because it's so minimal and easy to lock down.
</p></li><li><p>
IceWM for the windows manager.
</p></li><li><p>
Nautilus for file management, without the desktop feature enabled
(no background or desktop icons).
</p></li><li><p>
A custom, very limited, &ldquo;Start&rdquo; menu, with only the programs 
needed available.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The school year started, and from a technical standpoint, the system
performed better than I anticipated. The servers were minimally
loaded, and I never even had to bring the second and third LTSP
servers on-line. That first day was great, but my excitement was short-lived.
</p><p>
Our teachers <span   class="emphasis"><em>hated</em></span> the thin clients. There were nasty complaints,
grievances and even personal attacks pointed at me. In hindsight, I
easily could have avoided the problems. Currently, four years later,
almost the entire staff loves the thin clients. I have more requests for
thin clients in the classroom than I have the hardware to handle. Now,
four
years later, I see the results I expected that first day of school in
2003. 
</p><p>
The following are a few ways to introduce Linux successfully,
specifically thin clients, to an organization, while avoiding some of
the errors we made along the way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I started testing LTSP with a willing teacher back in 2001 when it
was very new. That 4th-grade classroom found a ton of bugs, but
worked through them and really loved the technology. It was the right
idea to start in such a way, but my focus was too narrow. Multiple
pilot programs, with staff demonstrations, are a very effective way to
get people talking positively about Linux. With LTSP, pilot programs
are easy, because a standard workstation class computer easily can act
as a server, supporting 4&ndash;6 thin clients. A few small-scale labs
really showcase the power of thin clients, and they usually are almost free
to implement. When staff members see firsthand the benefits OSS can
offer, especially when money is tight, they are much more willing to
try something new.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux is great. Thin clients are amazing. It's not necessary to
claim thin clients are better in every way than traditional
workstations. I made the mistake of talking about all the good things
thin-client technology meant and failed to point out the
shortcomings. As Linux users, we're very familiar with the reasons to
use OSS, because we've already learned that the benefits outweigh the
drawbacks. It's important to let new users judge those things for
themselves and come to a decision on their own (see the sidebar
outlining some pros and cons of thin clients). It's vital to be up
front and informative on both sides. In fact, stressing the shortcomings
sometimes pleasantly surprises people when they realize how
unimportant those faults really are.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Pros:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Cost: thin clients are cheap to buy and cheap to replace.
</p></li><li><p>
Consistency: because everyone is logging in to the
same server remotely, the user experience is the same, regardless of the
location.
</p></li><li><p>
Quick repair: if something goes wrong with hardware, a quick
replacement offers the exact same user experience, and the tech-support people can repair the hardware at their leisure.
</p></li><li><p>
Quiet, cool and low power consumption.
</p></li><li><p>
They are fast! Because thin clients perform at the speed of the
server, the end user gets to experience the responsiveness of a
$10,000 server instead of a low-end workstation.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Cons:</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Proprietary software is not as widely available for Linux.
Connecting to a Windows Terminal Server helps a bit with that, but at
a significant additional cost.
</p></li><li><p>
Floppy, CD and USB Flash drive support is fairly good now, but the 
experience is different from having a local drive.
</p></li><li><p>
Multimedia is the real downside. Sound works for some things but
not for others. Video streaming can work for short clips, but not
nearly as nicely as on a full workstation.
</p></li><li><p>
It's different, and different is uncomfortable.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Even though it sounds backwards, my advice is to point out the things
LTSP can't do. If you educate users regarding those faults, all
that's left to discover are the wonderful things thin clients can do.

We hired a consultant. In our case, it was late in the game, and it
was much more responsive than proactive. Hiring a professional
consultant will be money well spent. I don't mean it's necessary to
hire a consultant due to lack of personal ability, but rather as a
political move with the advantage of another hired brain. The fact of
the matter is, consultants actually do very little of the work. We
hired a well-known educational technology consulting company in
Michigan&mdash;Trimble Consulting. If I could do it over again, I
happily would have traded one of my servers for a single day of their help
and wisdom. That said, it is important to hire wisely. 
Consultants should be able to do the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Understand Linux, or at least not be afraid of it.
</p></li><li><p>
Know they're there to help the integration process, not determine whether
it's wise.
</p></li><li><p>
Be the bad guys. They should be willing to take blame. 
Consultants are paid a lot and are used to taking the heat off local
technicians.
</p></li><li><p>
Communicate very well and translate technical lingo into lay terms.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Hiring consultants is different from hiring helpers. As I
said, on the job work-wise, they do very little. The benefits they
offer behind the scenes are incredible. The credibility they add to a
project is priceless.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Here are some example explanations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A thin client is basically a remote keyboard, mouse and monitor
that hooks to a giant, powerful computer. Several people plug in to
the same giant server and share the power.
</p></li><li><p>
An Ethernet network is a lot like a garden hose. Every thin
client's hose hooks to a big valve, so the giant server needs a really
big hose in order to get the information to all the thin clients.
</p></li><li><p>
A USB Flash drive is like a floppy drive that holds a lot more
information. It's also easier to carry and less likely to lose data.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You get the idea. Communication is key, and being able to communicate
very complex ideas simply is a huge asset. In fact, looking back
over the past four years, our biggest difficulties were not technical,
but social. In general, people are not keen to change, so helping
them understand the process makes the change less foreign. It's
impossible to over-communicate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Our thin clients were donated Pentium 133 computers. Even in 2003,
Pentium 133s were ancient. The big problem is that they looked as old
as they were. In fact, most of them had been marked with permanent
markers, and many of them had CD drawers broken off the front. They
looked terrible.
</p><p>
So on the first day of school, teachers didn't notice the speed that a dual
Xeon 3.2GHz server with 6GB of RAM gives a person. The brand-new
gigabit backbone in the closet didn't impress them. The deafening
sounds of cooling fans in the server room didn't make them feel
special. They saw old, junky computers on the first day of school.
In fact, the computers looked worse than the Macintosh 5400s they left
behind the year before. I did get new 17" monitors, and brand-new
optical mice (which were pretty new technology then), but in the end,
they just saw cruddy old desktops. When staff members found out
the &ldquo;new&rdquo; computers couldn't even play audio CDs, they were sure
they'd been sold out.
</p><p>
In retrospect, for an additional 10% on the original purchase, I could
have gotten everyone an actual thin-client device, such as the type sold
by the LTSP developers at <a href="http://www.disklessworkstations.com" target="_self">www.disklessworkstations.com</a>. If that number
would have been 15% more than the original, they could have had thin-client devices with LCD displays. Never underestimate the power of
fancy new toys to win over hearts.
</p><p>
As I mentioned earlier, our four-year transition to thin
clients has been a bumpy road. In the end, OSS was powerful enough to
overcome even my shortsightedness. Our staff and our student
body love Linux. We've expanded our number of thin clients from the
original 75 to a couple hundred. This year, we introduced our first
24-station thin-client lab in the middle school. In fact, this year
was the first year I needed all three of those original servers. I'm
ashamed to admit that for three years, I had two brand-new servers
unplugged. Thankfully, that's no longer the case.

The Linux Foundation now has a travel fund for developers who need to
attend technical conferences but can't make it on their own. The fund is
open to &ldquo;elite community developers with a proven track record of
open-source development achievements and who don't otherwise have access to
funding for attending technical events&rdquo;. In other words, it's
&ldquo;for the
rock stars of the open-source world&rdquo;, as Jim Zemlin, Executive Director
of the Linux Foundation, puts it.
</p><p>
The fund covers travel to &ldquo;LF Collaboration Summits, the Linux
Foundation's
Japan Symposiums, the Kernel Summit, Ottawa Linux Symposium,
Linux.conf.au, desktop conferences, such as Guadec and Akademy, and other
technical conferences where true collaboration takes place&rdquo;. More
pointedly, it &ldquo;does not offer sponsorships to tradeshows or
nontechnical conferences&rdquo;.
