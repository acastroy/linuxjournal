Finally, a company that understands Internet media distribution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b60580.0x1c58298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
On April 2, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs along with EMI CEO Eric
Nicoli announced DRM-free downloads at a new cost of $1.29 US&mdash;a fee
that's $.30 
more than the current DRM-formatted music. Shouldn't music be DRM-free
anyway and not come at an extra cost? That's not what iTunes is saying
or showing, as it still is going to sell DRM music for $.99 
and DRM-free music for even more. Why put up with these over-priced
songs,
not only from iTunes but also from other on-line stores, such as Microsoft's MSN
Music that sells over-priced music, and like iTunes, the music comes with
DRM. 

</p><p>
The new DRM-free songs on iTunes will be in MP3 and WMA formats 
and supposedly will be of &ldquo;superior quality&rdquo;. That
mention of superior
quality, however, is merely to cover up the extra price and save iTunes
from the UK's fair trading pressure of infringement on European trading
regulations. Why should you have to deal with a company that makes you
pay more for freedom? Freedom is not something you should have to pay
for. Why pay for freedom when you can choose an on-line site
that gives you options the other record-label companies
don't offer? 
</p><p>
Such a site exists, and it gives you many choices,
including how you want to receive an album, such as a downloaded DRM-free
format (MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC or AAC) or a purchased CD that will be mailed
to you, all without the extra &ldquo;freedom fee&rdquo;. This site also
lets you
choose to pay what you think a particular album is worth, and it gives
you the option of re-downloading a purchased song if you lose it due to a 
faulty hard drive or misplaced
file. This site also gives you the option to back up music on another
device, without restrictions on the number of devices on which you can store
your music&mdash;something iTunes does not allow, and it's something I know I want to
be able to do with music I purchase. And, the best thing of all, this
site allows you the freedom to
share an album and give the gift of music to your friends. If you buy an
album, you can share it with up to three friends (based on the honor
system).
</p><p>
What if I tell you it's all possible with Magnatune&mdash;the company that says
&ldquo;We Are Not Evil&rdquo;, and it's just that, not evil. Magnatune
allows customers to
do everything mentioned above&mdash;plus more. It's not only an independent,
on-line record label, but also a company that wants to change how music is
distributed and open up possibilities for less-known bands and artists. The
artists and bands on Magnatune are not highly rated with albums or songs in
the Top 100, but they still are great to listen to and download. All Magnatune
needs is only one top artist to switch over to put it on
the map as a mainstream label company. Magnatune takes big strides to
label great-sounding artists, and one out of 300 artists gets signed.

What Magnatune Believes</h2></div></div><p>
This is straight from Magnatune's site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
All music should be shareware. Just as with software, you want to
preview, evaluate and pass along good music to others&mdash;in the process
of buying it.
</p></li><li><p>
Find a way of getting music from musicians to audiences that's
inexpensive and supports musicians. Otherwise, musical diversity will
continue to suffer greatly under the current system where only mega-hits
make money.
</p></li><li><p>
Musicians need to be in control and enjoy the process of having
their music released. The systematic destruction of musicians' lives is
unacceptable: musicians are very close to staging a revolution (and some
already have).
</p></li><li><p>
Creativity needs to be encouraged; today's copyright system of &ldquo;all
rights reserved&rdquo; is too strict. We support the Creative Commons
&ldquo;some
rights reserved&rdquo; system, which allows derivative works, sampling and
no-cost noncommercial use.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b60580.0x1c58b88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>&ldquo;Listen to more than 500 hand-picked complete albums. If you like what
you
hear, download an album for as little as $5 (you choose the price), or buy
a real CD, or license our music for commercial use. You'll get MP3s and
WAVs, and no copy protection (DRM), ever.&rdquo; (From <a href="http://magnatune.com" target="_self">magnatune.com</a>.)

Magnatune in the Open Source Community and Becoming a Freedom Fighter
for Music and Media</h2></div></div><p>
Magnatune recently has taken part in
the Linux community, allowing you 
to search and listen to its podcast and music directories without purchase from the KDE Amarok 1.4.4
player. This try-before-you-buy philosophy gives you the opportunity to listen to not just one song from an album,
but the full album, before deciding how much
you are willing to pay for it&mdash;if you choose to purchase it
at all. The great thing with
Magnatune's search-and-buy feature being put into the Amarok player is
that it allows
you to purchase an album from the player instead of going to the site, making
it easy to search Magnatune's massive album collection for specific genres, such as
Classical, Electronica, Jazz and Blues, Metal and Punk, New Age and Rock.
Once your purchase is complete, the song or album can be put into
any type of music player, such as an iPod or any other MP3 player. As I
said before, Magnatune lets you pay what you think the album is
worth. It does have a starting price of $5, with a maximum of $18 (the
typical purchasing price for an album is $8). Each song
is DRM-Free (at the price of about $.50 a song) and can be downloaded in
many formats to work on just about any music player and device. The best part
is that 50% of the sale price of each album goes directly to the artist.

Another great thing about Magnatune that blows iTunes out of
the water is its daily free song give-away, compared to iTunes weekly
song give-away. Some people hear the word free and think something must be wrong
or of poor quality, but people who use or develop open-source
and free software know that's not the case. What makes Magnatune's daily
DRM-free music give-away special is not only freedom, but also that the songs are
great to listen to and have amazing sound quality. But, that's not
all, Magnatune changes genres every day for the give-away. I plan to visit the
site on a daily basis to download the free song and browse for other
songs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9722f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Magnatune also has joined and supports the partly open-source Second
Life, which has become an on-line phenomenon that allows you to live a
second on-line virtual life, while making money on-line and
joining groups and meeting new people. If you're a member of the Second Life
world, Magnatune allows you to choose a genre to listen to while you're in
the game or in Magnatune's furnished tents, giving you a relaxing area to 
hang out with other Magnatune users, making it a better community yet
again. When you teleport to Magnatune's hang-out location, don't forget
to get a free Magnatune T-shirt for your avatar. Best of all, Magnatune
considers Second Life's playing of
its streams to be promotional use of its music and grants you a
license to use that music for free. Magnatune also says it will grant you
a collecting society waiver, so that if ASCAP or BMI ever asks you to
pay for the music you're using on Second Life, you can point them
to <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/second_life" target="_self">magnatune.com/info/second_life</a>.
</p><p>
Open Music has become one of the largest
projects that's made Magnatune so well known in the music industry and
Open Source community. Open Music is music that is shareable, available in
&ldquo;source code&rdquo; form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for
noncommercial use. It is the concept of open-source computer software
applied to music. Think of Open Music as open-source software, allowing
you not only to edit and sell it, but also to share the wealth with the
artist and Magnatune, or just give it back to the community so others
can then edit what you edited to make it even better. And, it's all under
the Creative Commons, including Magnatune's main site. One example of
this Open Music Project is the new
Amarok Live CD Project. Magnatune allowed the Amarok Project members and
community to bundle tracks from the Magnatune store that were licensed
under the attribution/noncommercial/share-alike version of the well-known Creative Commons license.

&ldquo;This is very exciting news about Magnatune. This is precisely the kind
of innovation that will solve the current crisis in music.&rdquo;&mdash;Lawrence
Lessig, founder and chairman of Creative Commons
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b60580.0x1c59738"></a>
The Business Model behind Magnatune</h2></div></div><p>
Besides joining the Second Life community and starting the Open
Music Project, Magnatune now has a MySpace site with more than 1,300
friends. Another on-line
community site Magnatune uses for advertising and marketing is YouTube.
Yes,
Magnatune has a YouTube page that has, at the time of this writing, 17 videos that include
information on Magnatune. And, you can watch and listen to artists from Magnatune 
on YouTube, over and over again, without having to
purchase or pay a royalty to watch the video. Because those free services
are used for marketing, the company and artists save money that they would
normally need for getting their names and labels out to the public. You
also can be a part of the Magnatune's marketing team by requesting free
recruiting cards or printing Magnatune mini-posters and handing them out.
</p><p>
Magnatune's founder John Buckman's idea was to target people who listen to
music in the background while they do other work (while writing
this article, I'm listening to Rocket City Riot, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Last Of The Pleasure
Seekers</em></span> from Magnatune) or music that gets little
radio airplay or major record distribution, but that has a fairly large
audience. Targeting those audiences is what keeps Magnatune's
business going in the long run.
</p><p>
One of the biggest ways Magnatune stays in business is the commercial
licensing it offers for the music it sells. It allows the music to be
used in films and television, on the Internet and for presentations. And, the license
contracts are royalty-free, meaning you don't have to pay more if
a project is successful. The 
license and the cost to use the music depend on the project. Magnatune
gives you a price quote in a matter of seconds from the site, and the
prices are a lot better than other commercial licensing fees and are 30%
lower than industry standard.
</p><p>
Music is not the only way Magnatune makes money. It sells
other merchandise, such as posters, clothing and mugs. As with the
albums, 50% of those sales go to the artist.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b60580.0x1c599a0"></a>
Running on Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
Magnatune does not just support open source, it also runs on it. Its
servers run Linux with the most widely available HTTP server on the
Internet&mdash;Apache 2 supporting and using PHP and OpenSSL. 
Magnatune uses a MySQL database to store and log
purchase information, and it's also used for searches on the
main site, such as for an artist or track. When the search is done, a
Perl script creates the track listings and playlists so transactions
can be made.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
So, if you're an open-source advocate and like
to listen to music that's not mainstream while supporting artists instead of putting
money in the label companies' pockets, visit
Magnatune's Web site and sign up for the free song of
the day and maybe buy some albums while you're there. And, if you're an
artist, Magnatune is just the place to check out, especially if
want to get your feet wet in the music industry. Magnatune is there to
help artists reach audiences and receive a profit (note that albums must have at
least 40 minutes of music). 
Then, you can listen to your album on Amarok's open-source media
player while making an
average of $1,500 US (according to Magnatune) if your album is accepted. So
let's
forget about iTunes and make the migration to a community-based project
with a great business model.
