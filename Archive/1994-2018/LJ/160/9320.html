AlphaMail takes a unique approach to providing a Web-based IMAP client.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd012f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
AlphaMail is a high-performance, feature-rich, open-source Web mail
system created at the University of Oregon. The interface includes
message snippets in indexes, UTF8 composition and numerous viewers
for attachments (such as image icon preview and file listings from
tarballs). It also tries to strike a balance between desirable features
and too much interface noise. It was created to address several problems
that exist with other open-source and commercial Web mail systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd014a8"></a>
Performance</h2></div></div><p>
The first concern AlphaMail addresses is performance. Almost all Web mail systems
(such as Horde's IMP Web mail Client and SquirrelMail) use IMAP from
within the Web server, which is incapable of persisting an IMAP session.
</p><p>
The IMAP protocol is designed to optimize access through persistent
access, so this is an inherent and recognized problem. The problem
is usually mitigated with an IMAP proxy that maintains a persistent
connection. The problems with this solution are multifaceted.
</p><p>
One problem is that the code in the Web mail client itself cannot
depend on the state of the IMAP connection and must repeat commands as
if each mouse click were a new IMAP session. This is a problem, because
the sequence of required events for a new session in the IMAP protocol
include authenticating and selecting the desired folder. The benchmarks
of several IMAP servers indicate that the repetition of the folder
selection command, even if the folder is already authenticated and
selected (that is, through a proxy), can cause significant extra server load.
</p><p>
These inefficiencies could be addressed through improvements in the
IMAP server and proxy algorithms, but another problem is intractable:
a proxy cannot improve the protocol. The fact that the Web mail client
is using IMAP forces it to behave as a complete standalone client. If
the developers want to add a complex feature, such as conversation views
(&agrave; la Google mail), which requires complex message cross-referencing across
several folders, the protocol itself becomes a major impediment.
</p><p>
AlphaMail solves these problems by including a middleware layer that
uses a simplified and extensible protocol for the Web application and
is responsible for optimizing access to the mail servers. The protocol
supports highly specialized commands that allow the Web code to 
ask for the information needed for a page directly, without having to make any
assumptions about the state of the IMAP connection.
</p><p>
This has the additional advantage that the IMAP protocol handling in
the middleware layer can be written in a high-performance language (in
this case C++), can cache results and can optimize the interaction. The
middleware program is known as the imap_webcache, because it caches both
data and network connections for the mail interaction.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd01768"></a>
Accessibility</h2></div></div><p>
The next concern was accessibility. Information systems in higher
education, government and many other environments must support access
for everyone. AlphaMail still is actively being tuned for access by
the disabled, but it is already optimized for other access concerns. For
example, site security policies might require or recommend that members
of the community disable browser features that regularly appear in US-CERT
advisories, such as JavaScript. The only Web e-mail I could find that
did not require JavaScript for even basic functionality was SquirrelMail,
and it was deemed too risky from a performance standpoint.
</p><p>
AlphaMail includes JavaScript enhancements, but those enhancements
have traditional CGI alternatives that become active if JavaScript is
disabled on the browser. All critical functions of the system will work
with any browser, independent of capabilities and settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd018c8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
AlphaMail supports GNU autoconf and has been built cleanly on many
Linux variants, FreeBSD, Solaris and Darwin (OS X). The easiest platform
to install is Fedora Core 5 via yum(1), as described on the AlphaMail
home page.
</p><p>
I highly recommend using Fedora Core 5 on a test machine to avoid the
headaches of dependency resolution for your initial trial run. The actual
build is pretty much what you'd expect, but solving runtime dependencies
can be challenging.
</p><p>
If you decide on a source build, first you need to install the
Boost C++ libraries (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd01a80"></a>
Installing Boost</h2></div></div><p>
You need the Boost Jam utility (usually named bjam) as well as
version 1.33 or better of the Boost C++ libraries. Jam is sort of a
combination between GNU autoconf and make. Follow the instructions from
the Boost Web site for details, but essentially, extract the files
and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# bjam install
</pre>
</p><p>
In rare circumstances, you may want to pass options (such as an
installation prefix). See the Getting Started guide on the Boost Web
site if you have special needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd01c38"></a>
Building AlphaMail from Source</h2></div></div><p>
The build is very much what you would expect:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./configure
# make
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
The configure script checks your system for dependencies and
tells you what is missing or out of date. You should be able to
complete all three steps as long as you have Boost installed, even if
Perl dependencies are not met.
</p><p>
Be aware that some versions of g++ have a bug that will cause the compiler
to go into an infinite loop while building imap_webcache. Two of the
files in the source (IMAPFolder_rules.cc and RFC2822.cc) can trip this
bug, but even with a good compiler, these files take a large amount of
time and space to build, so expect the compile to run for a few minutes.
</p><p>
On some systems, there can be problems with the location of files. For
example, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, Kerberos dependencies cause
OpenSSL code to fail to compile, which can be corrected by passing a
value for CXXFLAGS:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/kerberos/include" ./configure
</pre>
</p><p>
As with any other GNU autoconf system, check the config.log if the
configuration script fails to complete.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd01f50"></a>
Installing Runtime Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>
The biggest difficulty on most distributions is not building AlphaMail,
but rather meeting all of the prerequisites. Many distributions come
with an older version of mod_perl, libapreq and other Perl modules.
</p><p>
Make sure that you have libapreq2 and mod_perl &gt;= 2.0 installed before
messing with the other Perl dependencies, because some of them rely on one
or both. Once this is done, you should be able to install the remaining
Perl dependencies with your package manager or cpan(1).
</p><p>
You need to use cpan(1) if the packaged versions of a module do not
exist or are too old. See the sidebar on avoiding packaging conflicts
with your distribution's package manager.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd02108"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Avoiding Package Management Conflicts When Using cpan(1)</b></p><p>
Many Linux administrators do not like to use cpan(1) due to competition
between the files installed by the cpan utility and the distribution's
package manager. In production systems, therefore, it is desirable to
install Perl modules in a place where the package manager will not
see them.
</p><p>
AlphaMail looks for its own libraries in /usr/local/lib/alphamail (if
you chose the default prefix during the build), and you can install Perl
dependencies there without having to change anything about the runtime
configuration of the system.
</p><p>
First, set your environment to indicate you would like Perl to look in an
additional location (this is needed only during the build, the runtime
system already includes this path during startup):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/lib/alphamail
</pre>
</p><p>
If you use an alternate prefix during configure, alter the /usr/local
part of this to match.
</p><p>
Next, run cpan(1) and (re)configure it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cpan
cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg 
 &#8618;'PREFIX=/tmp/unneeded LIB=/usr/local/lib/alphamail'
</pre>
</p><p>
The PREFIX argument tells the build process what the general installation
prefix is; whereas, LIB tells it where to install the actual module
code. I use /tmp/unneeded for PREFIX and remove the files afterward,
because
AlphaMail needs only the library. Set PREFIX to something like /usr/local
if you need the manual pages or other extras that come with these modules.
</p><p>
If you want to save the cpan settings for future sessions, do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan&gt; o conf commit
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, install or upgrade the necessary Perl modules (which are listed when
you run configure):

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan&gt; install Time::HiRes
...
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to use these modules in your own scripts (or need to change
where an AlphaMail script looks for them), add the following line
near the top of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
use lib qw(/usr/local/lib/alphamail);
</pre>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd02790"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The build instructs you to create template configuration files with
the alphamail_genconfig utility. This script prompts you for all of
the necessary configuration options for a basic installation and creates
the necessary files in a location you provide.
</p><p>
You need a special user for a sandbox and knowledge of what user your
Web server runs as before starting configuration. I recommend creating
a user named sandbox for the former. Logins for this user should not
be enabled.
</p><p>
The configuration will ask for an installation prefix, which is whatever
you passed to configure. This is usually /usr/local, and the script will
verify correctness before continuing.
</p><p>
You will be asked to provide an IMAP prefix and separator for each IMAP
server you want to access with AlphaMail. Some IMAP servers use slash (/)
for the separator; others use dot (.). The prefix is a subfolder where
users put all their other mail folders. For example, if users have
shell access and their mail folders are stored in their home directories,
it might be policy to put all of them in a directory named mail,
in which case the prefix is probably mail.
</p><p>
It is important to note that some Web servers (such as Cyrus) use INBOX for
the prefix and dot (.) for the separator. The following procedure can
help you determine what to use. First, connect to the IMAP server from
the command line, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# openssl s_client -connect imap.example.com:993 # For SSL
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xd02a50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# telnet imap.example.com 143  # for no SSL
</pre>
</p><p>
These commands connect you to the IMAP server and allow you to
enter protocol commands. Type the following (the numbers are part of the commands):

<pre     class="programlisting">
1 login username password
2 list "" "%"
3 logout
</pre>
</p><p>
The username and password, of course, should be real user credentials
for a typical IMAP account. The responses to the second command should
look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX.Spam"
* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX.Trash"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xcf95a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which indicates that . is the separator and makes it pretty obvious
that INBOX is a common prefix (in this case all entries start with
INBOX.).
</p><p>
The prefix parameter is primarily an interface optimization: the interface
removes the prefix when displaying most folder names in order to
make things more compact. You can hand-edit any of the parameters in the
resulting alphamail_config file, which is a commented text file. The
entry for defining a pair of typical IMAP servers that serve two mail
exchanges looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
imap_servers: example.com=imap.example.com:993[INBOX.], 
&#8618;example.net=imap.example.net:143[/]
</pre>
</p><p>
The above setting indicates that users should be able to select their
mail domain on login (example.com or example.net), and associates these
with a corresponding IMAP server, port, prefix and IMAP path separator.
</p><p>
The separator in the brackets is always required, but the prefix is
not. The notation [/] means no prefix, with slash as the separator. The
IMAP connections will be insecure if you use anything but the SSL
alternate port 993.
</p><p>
Attachment viewers and other external programs run in a sandbox that uses
a chroot jail, user ID protections and other filesystem restrictions
to ensure that a bug in a viewer cannot compromise anything more than
the file the user is trying to view, which by definition would be the
file containing the exploit. This is where you will use the extra user
you created earlier.
</p><p>
The sandbox utility is installed in /usr/local/libexec/sandbox, by
default, and is a setuid program. It is important that the permissions of
this executable allow execution by the Web server, but it is a security
hazard to allow any other user access to the utility. I recommend
that AlphaMail be run on a standalone system that serves only Web mail
and nothing else, with no shell access for users.
</p><p>
The configuration also asks you to configure the large file-sharing
system. This option allows users to upload files to the AlphaMail
system, so that others can download them later. Large file sharing is
useful when someone needs to send a file that is larger than is allowed
or recommended as part of an e-mail message. File sharing has several
safeguards to prevent abuse, including terms-of-use agreements, size
limits, password protection, encryption, download limits and time-based
expirations. Choosing a zero size for the size limit in file sharing
disables the feature.
</p><p>
The final step is to edit the Apache configuration. Make sure that
mod_perl2 and libapreq2 are loaded with directives, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LoadModule apreq_module modules/mod_apreq2.so
LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xcf99c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, include the generated alphamail.conf Apache configuration file. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Include /usr/local/etc/alphamail/apache/alphamail.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xcf9b20"></a>
Running AlphaMail</h2></div></div><p>
Apache and imap_webcache must be running for AlphaMail to work. Startup
order does not matter. A sample Red Hat init script for the Web cache is
included and will be installed in /usr/local/share/alphamail/util/init.d.
</p><p>
A garbage collection script must be run periodically from cron. AlphaMail
writes numerous files as the mail system operates, most of which are
decoded MIME messages and attachments. These files cannot be 
cleaned reliably by the Web software, as there are no guarantees about user
behavior. The script is called garbage_sweeper and is well documented
in the Administration Guide.
</p><p>
AlphaMail is in production use at the University of Oregon. The
performance and usability results have been very encouraging, and the
former are available at the AlphaMail home page.
</p><p>
However, the system is still new, and there are some latent bugs that
have yet to be solved. The imap_webcache itself is a rather complicated
piece of software that may have occasional problems. As a result,
I recommend running an included utility called the hang_detector (in
/usr/local/share/alphamail/util by default). You must edit this script
before using it, and it requires a valid IMAP user in order to work.
</p><p>
It runs a full query against the Web cache every 15 seconds and is capable
of restarting the imap_webcache (via the included init script). It is
also capable of sending mail to administrators if desired.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xcf9d88"></a>
Common Problems</h2></div></div><p>
There are several places where you can run into difficulty on a new
installation. The Administrator's Guide included with AlphaMail has many
tips on how to solve these issues.
</p><p>
One of the most puzzling problems is produced by accessing the service
via an incorrect domain name. The cookie that maintains the session
is tied to the server domain that you specify during configuration
and is stored in a parameter in the AlphaMail apache configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PerlSetVar alphamailDomain server.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
If the user is able to access the login page with an unqualified hostname (such as server), the cookie will not be exchanged properly
and login will fail without any error whatsoever. The login is actually
succeeding, but the browser is not sending the cookie back because of
the mismatched URL.
</p><p>
Fortunately, most users connect though a link or type an insecure
HTTP URL. The former is never a problem, and a redirect does a nice
job of correcting the latter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost _default_:80&gt;
   RedirectMatch ^/alphamail/?$ https://server.example.com/
   &#8618;alphamail/index.html
   RedirectMatch ^/alphamail/mail/?$ https://server.example.com/
   &#8618;alphamail/mail/index.html
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Other problems usually involve dependencies, configuration errors,
incorrect permissions or missing auxiliary directories. The best
indication of these are errors in alphamail_ui.log, which by default is
created in /var/log.
</p><p>
SELinux also can be the source of problems. I have not run AlphaMail
with SELinux, and unless you are willing to create your own security
profile, you probably will need to turn it off or disable enforcing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc09580.0xcfa0f8"></a>
The Future of AlphaMail</h2></div></div><p>
AlphaMail development has been mostly concerned with performance and
core functionality to this point, and I don't expect these two issues
to become any less important in the future, as the product is directed
at environments that have a large and diverse user community.
</p><p>
It is quite feature-rich, but certainly not all-inclusive. Limiting
feature creep is an ongoing requirement, because the critical concern is
easy and reliable access to essential functionality, not global coverage
of mail client features.
</p><p>
Still, there are plans for significant improvements and additions, such
as an internationalized interface, optional Ajax components that would
improve client interaction and conversation views.
