LMMS&mdash;Linux MultiMedia Studio</h2></div></div><p>
Initial screenshots of LMMS will give you a hint of FruityLoops and
the like, but in reality, LMMS takes a completely different tack. LMMS
takes on a micro-managed approach, and it probably will appeal to 
control freaks who want to generate their own samples or instruments
from scratch. With the ability to layer instruments and tracks, you can
create whole songs from the ground up.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9690f1.large.jpg"><img src="9690f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
LMMS&mdash;the Music Suite for the Ultimate Control Freak
</p></div></div><p>
Unlike most compositional software under Linux, LMMS takes an alternative
approach to midi for many circumstances, by synthesizing through wave
instead. This sidesteps the often annoying process of making midi
work under Linux, although midi still can be used and is very much a
part of LMMS. By tweaking all the knobs and available options, you
can generate entirely original sounds and use them in any way you see fit.
</p><p>
I managed to generate some brilliant effects and samples for my own
musical projects. This likely will appeal most
to dance-music DJs and also to fans
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nine Inch Nails</em></span> or the more recent <span   class="emphasis"><em>Massive
Attack</em></span>-style music for those
who want unique samples, or it will appeal to fans of retro 1980s synthesized sound
for those who want to make whole orchestrations.
</p><p>
Installation is a breeze, as LMMS resides in many distributions'
repositories. Under Debian-based distributions, all I had to do was a simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install lmms
</pre>
</p><p>
For those who can't find a binary for their system, however, a simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
(as root or sudo) 
# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e6580.0x14de8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with the source is all that is required. Thankfully, LMMS doesn't
have too many strange dependencies, so it should compile 
right off the bat for most systems.
</p><p>
Once you dive into the world of LMMS, a steep learning curve
presents itself. Some tutorials and demos are included, but these will
leave most users in the dark on many issues (but they are worth
examining as they do uncover the uses of many GUI items). The demos are
indeed worth a look and show off the capabilities of the program. The
demos include
Bach's &ldquo;Preludium and Fuge in A Minor&rdquo;, which is impressive when
you watch the keys played in real time under each instrument's settings,
and other cool demos are included that range from general dance music
to the occasional more atmospheric piece.
</p><p>
The best tip for exploring LMMS for the first time is to click on
the yellow star on the left whose tab is titled My presets. From here,
you can play around with some already-tweaked instrument settings and 
various GUI buttons and sound settings until you come up with something
that sounds interesting and the interface becomes more familiar. Also,
be sure to look at the green musical note above the yellow star,
titled My samples. This contains the base instruments to begin with
and offers a large variety, including (but not limited to) some
impressive drum samples, Latin guitars, as well as some amazing string,
choir and atmospheric effects.
</p><p>
Despite all of the features and demos, however, it's worth visiting
the LMMS Wiki. Documentation is still lacking for this project,
but hopefully this improves in the future, particularly in relation
to chord compositions and note editing. Documentation issues aside,
the program is quite stable at the moment and can at least be used as a
good beat sequencer. If you can figure out the interface for instrument
composition, whole tracks also will be at your fingertips.
</p><p>
Some other impressive features are JACK and LADSPA support, but best
of all is the ability to mix an instrument in surround as opposed to
just stereo. When I asked lead developer Tobias Doerffel about the
development status, he mentioned that LMMS is still rather unstable on
64-bit platforms, but after this is fixed, it will be in a quite usable
state. He also wants to include a mixer that mixes all of the tracks as
well as improve the available JACK support.
</p><p>
Currently, this is fairly mature beta software that looks extremely
promising, and it is lacking only decent documentation&mdash;definitely
worth a look for any home musician.

inotail&mdash;Inotify Enhanced Tail</h2></div></div><p>
For all you system administrators out there keeping track of important log files
with tail, this is definitely worth a look. When using the follow mode
(<tt  >tail -f filename</tt>), tail re-reads a file once a second by default. inotail
takes a different approach by making use of a newer kernel feature, the
inotify API. Instead of a clumsy cyclical update based purely on time,
inotail listens to special events sent by the kernel using the new
API.
</p><p>
After testing inotail, I was happy to see its results. I simply took a text
file and read it with the command <tt  >inotail -f
test.txt</tt>. With the text
file, I added lines one at a time and saved the document each time as I
added a line. As soon as I pressed Save, the inotail screen output instantly
updated without a hitch. Okay, so it's not exactly going to impress your
mates, but system administrators probably are going to find an instant use
for this far more elegant approach to keeping an eye on file updates.
</p><p>
I'm afraid that you still will have to compile this one from source,
but it isn't hard. According to developer Tobiad Klauser's Web site,
inotail should be in the Debian repository soon, but it isn't there at the
time of this writing. To
compile and install inotail, simply extract the tarball (available on the
main page of the Web site), and go to the new directory. Enter the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make 
(as root or sudo) 
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
As with most source compilations, this places the executable
in /usr/local/bin by default. If you would rather place it in
/usr/bin, enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make prefix=/usr install
</pre>
</p><p>
The only real factor hampering this project for now is time. inotail
requires at least a 2.6.13 kernel, which still is fairly young
for many system administrators who tend to use somewhat older and more mature
distributions than the rest of us. After a year or so has passed, when inotail
has been accepted into the Debian archive and administrators have upgraded
their distributions, inotail should be finding its way into many an
admin's toolbox.

Karmen</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9690f2.large.jpg"><img src="9690f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Karmen&mdash;for a Clean and Minimalist Environment
</p></div></div><p>
For those of you who like minimalist window managers, Karmen may be your
future choice. Designed to &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, it has no dependencies except
Xlib and no configuration file to fiddle around with. According to the
README file, these are its main goals for full release:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Intuitive, efficient window management.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a high-quality look and feel.
</p></li><li><p>
Standards compliance (ICCCM and EWMH/NetWM).
</p></li><li><p>
Work well as a standalone window manager.
</p></li><li><p>
Work well with other desktop utilities and environments.
</p></li><li><p>
Focus on window management and let other tools do the rest.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Head to the main Web site to grab the latest tarball. Indeed, installing
it was a cinch. Doing a simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
(as root or sudo) 
# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e6580.0x14dfcb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
was all that was required, and as it says on the tin, there are no weird little
dependencies to get in the way. It also happens to
be quick and sleek, and each time I turned my head back around to look at the monitor,
<tt  >configure</tt>, <tt  >make</tt> or
<tt  >make install</tt> was already done!
</p><p>
Once you have the Karmen desktop running, moving windows around is
nice and familiar in a KDE/GNOME/Windows way, with clicking to focus
and window resizing working in the intuitive way users have come to
expect. Rather than the all-too-common annoyance of having to click
on a window's titlebar to change focus that plagues many lightweight
window managers, Karmen lets you switch window focus by clicking within
a window's body. Maximizing is a different affair though; whereas two
obvious minus and close buttons sit at the top right of a window,
maximizing requires that you double-click the titlebar&mdash;not immediately
obvious. For a list of windows (whether active or minimized), right-click
on the desktop, and a new menu appears, allowing you to bring
to focus any windows currently running.
</p><p>
Another interesting note: Karmen seems to be quite a keyboard-driven
window manager. For instance, to tell a window to stay on top of others,
click the titlebar with the Shift key held down. Shift-clicking again 
disables the stay-on-top property of the window. A welcome addition
to minimalist window managers, pressing the familiar old Alt-Tab cycles between windows. In fact, most basic GUI functions can be performed via
the keyboard, generally by using a combination of Alt and another key.
</p><p>
However, Karmen is quite young in its development, with some strong
limitations in its current form. Still lacking is any kind of menu for
major functions, such as logging out or choosing a simple xterm. Indeed,
Karmen still requires that you kill its process manually to exit&mdash;obviously something that will be changed in the future, but a definite
indicator of a project that's still in its infancy. Lacking too are
startup scripts to start the window manager cleanly; you either have
to make your own script or edit .xinitrc. For those who can't be bothered
with this, you also could start Karmen from the command line, but you
have to add <tt  >&amp; xterm</tt> specifically after the
command. Thankfully, these
topics are touched upon in a nice man page&mdash;a professional touch at
this early stage. Also, for now, Karmen is a strictly one-desktop affair,
but hopefully this also will change.
</p><p>
All limitations aside, however, developer Johan Veenhuizen's approach
seems to be one of working on individual sections cleanly and then moving
on. The coding is indeed very clean and stable&mdash;although in its
infancy&mdash;and looks like it will be a snazzy little desktop once finished. I reckon Karmen
definitely will find a home with many niche users once it matures.

GAMGI&mdash;General Atomistic Modeling Interface</h2></div></div><p>
For this last project, I thought I'd throw in something for the mad
scientists out there. According to the home page, GAMGI's goals are to
provide the community with a free software package to construct, view and
analyze atomic structures, and to make it as powerful and as simple to
use as possible. GAMGI's developers also are probably the most hard-core
free-software advocates I've seen since Stallman himself. Scattered
throughout the installation instructions and user manuals are loads
of exhortations to harness the power of source and compile it yourself,
as well as many other passionate free-software-related endeavors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9690f3.large.jpg"><img src="9690f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
GAMGI&mdash;for the mad scientist. Can you believe that thing
is a heroin molecule?
</p></div></div><p>
Here are GAMGI's stated aims from these obviously passionate developers:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
GAMGI aims to be useful for: 1) the scientific community working in
atomistic modeling, which needs a graphic interface to build and analyze
atomic structures; 2) the scientific community at large, which needs a
graphic interface to study atomic structures and to prepare images for
presentations; 3) teaching the atomic structure of matter in schools and
universities, even inviting students to run GAMGI at home; 4) science
promotion, in exhibitions and science museums.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Installation can be a little tricky for the newbie, but anyone comfortable
with things such as make's role or symlinking should be okay. GAMGI
is designed to be as standardized as possible in its requirements, and
it should work with any standard X11 installation, though it does have one
or two esoteric library requirements. Glib and GTK should be fine with
most systems, as well as FreeType, but you may have to seek out and
install Expat and Gtkglarea.
</p><p>
For those seeking a simple binary, an RPM is usually provided at GAMGI's
download page. The RPM is designed to be LSB-compliant and should convert
easily with a utility such as alien for Debian-based systems. At
the time of this writing, however, the link was taken down, so please check
the site again at a later date or bug the developers. For those seeking
to compile from source (keeping the developers happy), a few more steps
than your run-of-the-mill tarball need to be taken. First,
it's easiest if GAMGI is extracted and compiled somewhere public, such
as /usr/local/src, as you probably will want to symlink to the compiled
binary later. Grab the tarball from the given link and extract it.
</p><p>
Once extracted, simply open a console and make your way to the src
directory under the new folder. Now run the command
<tt  >make</tt>, and if all
goes well, GAMGI should compile successfully. If
<tt  >make</tt> returns errors,
check that you have all of the needed libraries installed. If they are,
your shared libraries may be installed to another path than what GAMGI's
make script is expecting. Edit the make_local file in the src
directory and continue. Once compilation has completed, you can run the
gamgi binary from the src directory, or symlink to it for easier
access with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -s /usr/local/src/gamgi-(version)/src/gamgi 
 &#8618;/usr/bin/gamgi
</pre>
</p><p>
Once all that nasty stuff is out of the way, the weird science can
begin. Some interesting templates and tutorials have been included in
GAMGI's dat directory. From the menu, choose File&rarr;Import and choose an
atomic structure at random. Ever wondered what adrenaline looks like? Try
molecule/drugs/adrenaline.xml. Presto! An adrenaline molecule appears
in the main black window. To play around with the view, press and hold
the left, middle or right mouse buttons and move the mouse around. The
left button controls rotation, the middle buttons controls the X and Y
axes, and the right button controls the zoom function. You have to admit,
it is pretty cool to play with!
</p><p>
To explore further, there are a bunch of other menus related to
all things atomic, but I haven't the foggiest idea how to use any of
them (or what they even do). I think this is best left to the atomic
scientists. Check the doc directory for further instructions,
and have a read through the well-constructed HTML manual pages, or
head over to the GAMGI home page and converse with fellow white-coated
boffins. Either way, I'm sure I'll sleep easy tonight now that I know what a
propane molecule looks like and have confirmed that I am, indeed, a geek!
