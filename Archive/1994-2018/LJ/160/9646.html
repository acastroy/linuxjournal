Create a virtual private network between your Nokia E61 phone and a Linux
gateway.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218f580.0x2287240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A virtual private network (VPN) allows you to send traffic across an
untrusted network without exposing the content of that
traffic. Conceptually, this is done by creating a pipe between two hosts
where all network traffic transferred is protected by cryptography.
</p><p>
The example in this article is connecting a Nokia E61 device to a home
network through a VPN over the Internet. The Nokia E61 is a smartphone
that has Wi-Fi support as well as a VPN client. A similar procedure
might work for other phone models using the same VPN client
software, though the hardware was not on hand to test this. The Linux
side was run on Fedora Linux 6; other distros might have slight path
and package name changes.
</p><p>
The VPN support on the Nokia E61 uses IP security (IPSec). Openswan is an
IPSec server that is configured on the Linux machine to provide the
other end of the virtual network.
</p><p>
I should mention one caveat up front: I've been unable to configure
the VPN client on the phone to connect to a server that does not have
a static IP address.
</p><p>
To keep notation simple, I refer to the phone as e61 and the
server running Openswan as vserv. The IP address of the e61 is
irrelevant to the article, as you likely will be moving around
to different Wi-Fi hotspots with the phone. When a VPN is set up, the e61
gets another IP address, which the e61 refers to as the virtual IP
address. Once the VPN is set up, this virtual IP address is where
all traffic to and from the e61 is sent. For this article, I use a
192.168.x.x IP address for this e61 VPN address. As the non-VPN IP
address of the e61 is mostly irrelevant, unless I explicitly mention 
otherwise, the e61 IP address will be this non-Internet-routable IP 
address.
</p><p>
Unlike the other network settings on the phone, you cannot 
configure the VPN manually using the e61 itself. You have to create a package
containing all the information about the VPN and install that package
on the phone. These packages are the SIS files. A VPN SIS file also must
be digitally signed before the e61 will allow you to install it.
Signed SIS files normally have an sisx extension. The most difficult 
part of setting up the e61 to talk to Openswan is in creating the sisx
file to install on the phone.
</p><p>
The SIS file still must be digitally signed, even if you have set the
configuration parameter Software installation to All in App
Mgr/Options/Settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218f580.0x2287660"></a>
The Contents of the sisx Package</h2></div></div><p>
The sisx package is composed of three files. Two of these are 
boilerplate-type package metadata (the VPN.pin and VPN.pkg files).
</p><p>
Getting the boilerplate files out of the way, the VPN.pin file is
mostly uninteresting and is shown in Listing 1, and the VPN.pkg
file is shown in Listing 2. Both files should work fine without
any changes. Note that the paths shown in Listing 2 are to be
interpreted relative to the phone itself and should not be changed.

The VPN.pol file shown in Listing 3 defines the meat of how to connect to the VPN and
what key to use for authentication. 
</p><p>
Some things need to be changed in VPN.pol before using it. The main changes
are the static IP address of the Openswan server (192.168.0.1) and the
password to use to connect. The server's IP address appears more than
once in the configuration file. To avoid any confusion about virtual
IP addresses mentioned above, this IP address is the one from which vserv
can be reached publicly from the Internet. The password is in the last
field: the KEY. The number is the string length of the key that
follows after a space.
</p><p>
If USE_XAUTH is set to true, when establishing the VPN connection
the e61 prompts you for a user name and password with which to connect.
This provides an additional level of security. In the event that the
e61 is stolen, the thief will have to know your user name and password
in order to access your VPN.
</p><p>
Openswan can use either PAM or a separate config file to test the
user name and password on the server (more on this later).

Creating the sisx VPN Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
Three Windows executables are used to create a signed SIS file.
DevCertRequest.exe is used once to create a certificate to sign the
SIS file; makesis.exe and signsis.exe then are used to create the
package and sign it. The last two commands are part of the S60 SDK
available for free from Nokia's Web site. All of these Windows
executables can be run in Wine, though you need to have MFC42.DLL and
MSVCP60.dll available to run DevCertRequest.
</p><p>
It's best to get the certificate in order to begin; register for
free at <a href="http://symbiansigned.com" target="_self">symbiansigned.com</a>, and download the DevCertRequest executable.
Registration requires your name, e-mail address, organization, address
and phone number.
</p><p>
DevCertRequest is used only to input a few settings and generate a key
and a certificate sign request (.csr file). Unfortunately, the
DevCertRequest executable is actually an installer, so you have to
install this application and then execute it 
(Figure 1). For this article,
DevCertRequest_30_10_2006_v2.0.exe was used. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9646f1.large.jpg"><img src="9646f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Installing the DevCertRequest Application in Wine
</p></div></div><p>
After all the pain of installing DevCertRequest, using it consists of
five simple steps, and it isn't needed again afterward. You give
the location for the new csr file (monkeyiq.csr); the location
for your new private key (monkeyiq-private-key.key) and a password for
it; your country, state and company; the IMEI of your phone
(as DevCertRequest tells you, keying *#06# on the phone will show it)
and which capabilities you want for your certificate; and a
confirmation that the information is correct.
</p><p>
To create the certificate itself, you have to return to
<a href="http://symbiansigned.com" target="_self">symbiansigned.com</a> and upload the csr file. First
log in, and then select
the My Symbian Signed tab. In the side panel, the Developer Certificates
option has the Request sub-option. At the bottom of this page, you can
upload the csr file (Figure 2). The next page allows you to
download your certificate (Figure 3).

The makesis.exe and signsis.exe files can be extracted from the
&ldquo;S60 Platform for Symbian OS&rdquo; SDK,
as shown in Listing 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218f580.0x2288898"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

With the certificate (monkeyiq.csr) file, you now can roll the sisx file
with the code shown in Listing 5. Make sure
the three files that make up the package use the carriage return
plus new line combination to terminate each line instead of the standard
Linux new line only; see unix2dos(1). These three files are the pol,
pkg and pin files shown in Listings 3, 2 and 1,
respectively.

Installing the VPN sisx and Final e61 Setup</h2></div></div><p>
Any method can be used to transfer the sisx file to the e61. I've used
Bluetooth push, in which case it can be installed on the e61 directly
from the incoming messages list. As this sisx file contains a
password, it is better to transfer it to the phone using a wired
method.
</p><p>
Using a mini-SD card in the e61 and plugging in the USB connection
cable to the phone and a Linux machine likely will bring up a file
browser for the mounted SD card on the e61. Copy the file to 
a convenient location, such as Documents/vpn on the e61, and eject or unmount the
SD card to force a disk sync before removing the cable (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9646f4.large.jpg"><img src="9646f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Copy the VPN file to a subdirectory of Documents on the memory
card.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the sisx file is copied to the e61 memory card, the
Menu/Office/File Manager on the e61 lets you navigate to the VPN
directory on your memory card. When you click the joystick on the VPN sisx
file, the phone asks if you want to install it. Right after clicking
on the sisx file, you should see something like that shown in Figure 5.
After inspecting some metadata, you'll see the ominous-looking
screen shown in Figure 6. As you have just created the package from a bunch
of text files and you've looked over them for nasties, this security
warning shouldn't really be much of a problem to ignore.

Figure 6. As we made the package, we trust that this is not really a
security issue.
</p></div></div><p>
The VPN sisx file can be prepared for use by going to
Menu&rarr;Tools&rarr;Settings&rarr;Connection&rarr;VPN. Select VPN access points and
Options&rarr;New access point. Set the connection name to something
memorable, and set the policy name and access point. A convenient
access point is EasyWLAN. You also might want to set the proxy server
address and port. It's nice to be able to surf the Internet and
get to Intranet servers over the VPN. Directing all Web traffic to the
VPN has the added bonus that the Wi-Fi hotspot you are using isn't able to
record the Web sites you visit. The final stage is shown in
Figure 7.
</p><p>
If you are already using WEP to connect locally and want to continue
to do so and be able to test the VPN locally, define another VPN
access point, setting its Internet access point to your WEP access
point. Having the second VPN config means you won't be prompted for
the WEP key when connecting locally. There is little gain in doing
VPN over WEP except for not having to loosen the security on your
wireless access point.

Setting Up the Linux Openswan End</h2></div></div><p>
Packages are shown at <a href="http://rpmseek.com" target="_self">rpmseek.com</a> for Fedora, Mandriva and SUSE
Linux. Debian.org also lists an Openswan package. On a Fedora Linux
machine, Openswan can be installed simply by using <tt  >yum install
openswan</tt>.
As mentioned previously, I used a Fedora Linux machine for this article;
other distributions may have subtle differences.
</p><p>
The two main areas for configuring Openswan are the /etc/ipsec.conf file
and a handful of files in /etc/ipsec.d. The main config file can be
left as it stands. A few settings that might be of interest are
<tt  >forwardcontrol=yes</tt> to turn packet forwarding on and off when Openswan
is started and stopped. The other interesting option is the interfaces
setting, allowing you to control which IPSec interface is bound to
which network interface&mdash;for example, <tt  >interfaces="%defaultroute
ipsec2=eth1 ipsec3=ppp1"</tt>. If no interfaces parameter is
specified,
Openswan works on the network interface that has the default
route. For Internet VPN connections, this is fine.
</p><p>
Another parameter that might come in handy in the ipsec.conf file is
setting <tt  >plutodebug=all</tt>, and reading your syslog files if you can't 
connect.
</p><p>
To describe a connection to Openswan for the e61, create a config file
/etc/ipsec.d/e61.conf, as shown in Listing 6. The pfs setting is
for perfect forward security. Unfortunately, I've had no luck using
this option and connecting from the e61. As shown in the VPN config
for the e61, I've listed the left value as
<tt  >%defaultroute</tt>, so
Openswan will substitute the IP address of the network interface to which
the default route points. As the default route is to the Internet,
this works well. I've also used the DNS name of the vserv as leftid;
this should be optional. You need to substitute your DNS name
for monkeyiq.example.org in the config file.
The rightsourceip is the virtual IP address that the e61 will use when
talking over the VPN. For the firewall rules (shown later),
I have assigned the hostname for the e61 to 192.168.6.252 in /etc/hosts.

Finally, the USE_XAUTH option in the VPN policy needs Openswan to
have a user name and password lookup for this connection. The Openswan
README.XAUTH file recommends against using PAM for this. The password
file can be created using htpasswd from the Apache package, as shown in
Listing 8. A sample of the passwd file is shown in Listing 9.

A Hole in the Wall&mdash;iptables</h2></div></div><p>
Trying to debug packet logs on the machine that is running as the
IPSec server can be a little difficult. Packets that arrive encrypted
are decrypted and put onto the network interface to appear as though
they have arrived without any encryption. Part of a packet log is
shown in Listing 10, showing a packet that appears
to have come from the e61's IP address without any encryption. The log
is further complicated because the WEP setup gives the e61 the same IP
address as the VPN does. For traffic from the Internet, the top two
packets will have a random IP address instead of the e61. To get a clearer
picture of the packet data, connecting the e61 through a laptop to
vserv allows proper packet snooping on the laptop. The imaps packet in
Listing 10 will not be seen by the laptop&mdash;only a
bidirectional stream of ESP packets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218f580.0x2280d58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
The iptables commands shown in Listing 11 provide a base to
allow the e61 to connect to the IPSec server from the
Internet. 
</p><p>
The packet filtering rules are quite simple. Allow Internet Security
Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) packets to enter and
exit the server and allow any Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
traffic, assuming that the IPSec server will be responsible for sorting
out fraudulent packets. VPN traffic itself is sent through the ESP
packets; the ISAKMP is used at the VPN session startup, and those packets
also are logged, so that the syslog monitor can alert you of strange
connection attempts or door knocking.
</p><p>
Because the non-encrypted traffic is placed on the network interface
when Openswan is done with it, the rules have to allow e-mail and squid
connections from the e61 IP address. I need to have these rules here
because normally no connections can be initiated on the network
interface connected to the Internet. If you filter outward traffic too,
you have to allow packets from these services to the e61 to be
sent to the Internet network interface (to be encrypted by Openswan
before being sent to the proper Internet address).
</p><p>
The firewall rules are designed to be used with a default policy of
drop. The logging commands can be added or removed to help debugging
by searching for the relevant log prefix in /var/log/messages to see
which packets are moving around before the firewall may drop them.
The script shown in Listing 12 undoes what was done
by Listing 11 to disable remote access again.
</p><p>
You also might want to consider using a Single Packet Authorization
(SPA) client on the e61 and setting up the server to open the
firewall ISAKMP port only after a successful SPA. See Michael Rash's
&ldquo;Single Packet Authorization&rdquo; article in the April
2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for more information on SPA.

Connecting!</h2></div></div><p>
One more complication exists for using some of the publicly available
Wi-Fi hotspots. Depending on where on the globe you are, many of these
hotspots follow the pattern that when you try to open a Web site, they
redirect you to their Wi-Fi login page, you authenticate to them, and
then you can use the Internet. If you simply open up a VPN access point
on the e61 that is set to use the EasyWLAN as its Internet access
point, things will not work. The e61 will start the Wi-Fi
connection and immediately try to send data to set up a VPN
connection. As you have to authenticate with the Wi-Fi hotspot before
this,
it will let traffic through, but then things will come crashing down.
</p><p>
A way to get around this is to open the Web browser and directly
connect just using EasyWLAN without any VPN whatsoever. Once you have
authenticated to the hotspot, leave the browser running and use the menu
key to get back to the main menu, and then open the e-mail client. For the
access point this time, use the VPN that has EasyWLAN set as its
Internet access point. The existing Wi-Fi connection is reused, and the
VPN is layered on top. To get secure Web browsing, you can then leave
the e-mail program by holding the menu key and going back to the
browser. Exit the browser, and the still-running e-mail program holds the
VPN open. Start the browser again, and select the VPN as your
access point.
</p><p>
Of course, if the Wi-Fi network you are connecting to allows
connections without this preamble, opening any application that
wants a data connection should allow you to select the new VPN as your
access point. Also, if the Wi-Fi hotspot remembers your MAC address
and allows reconnection without explicitly having to log in each time,
you can start the VPN directly on subsequent connections.
</p><p>
Once the VPN has connected to vserv, the e61 prompts you for the
user name and password to use for XAUTH verification 
(Figure 8).
</p><p>
After XAUTH verification, you should be able to use the VPN without
noticing it. In this case, I can browse the Internet using my LANs
proxy server to fetch the data
(Figure 9).

What's Next</h2></div></div><p>
Being able to use a DNS name in the e61 VPN policy would be wonderful
for folks who don't have cheap access to static IP addresses. I'm
still investigating how to connect using public key cryptography
instead of the preshared key as shown in this article. For connecting a
single e61 to the network, using a large enough preshared key should
still be quite secure.
