Save your quarters; you won't need them when you build your vintage arcade
player.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e00580.0x1ef82f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I grow weary of hearing how bad Linux is for gaming. In this article, 
I buck that stereotype and show how to use penguin power to relive
the '80s. In this cool project, I describe how to construct a fully functional
arcade cabinet. When complete, you'll be able to play all the old
coin-op games from your childhood in the coin-free luxury of your living
room (or garage&mdash;depending on the tolerance of individual
spouses).
</p><p>
The system uses software based on the MAME (Multi-Arcade Machine
Emulator) Project to play the original classics emulated in
Linux. MAME uses software to emulate the original arcade hardware.
This article explains how to connect the original joysticks and buttons, and even
gives some pointers regarding purchasing rights to the original games.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e00580.0x1ef8558"></a>
The Biggest Case Mod You'll Ever See</h2></div></div><p>
First off, it's the arcade case that makes this project truly awesome.
If you don't have an actual arcade cabinet, with original arcade
controls, you might as well go back to playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zork</em></span> on your TSR-80 for
your dose of nostalgia. The cabinet is what makes this cool, period.
It's up to you to decide whether to make a cabinet or buy a used one.
If you make the whole thing from scratch, the design is completely up
to you. The downside is that doing this requires some woodworking skills. I
have no such skills. In fact, to me, &ldquo;saw&rdquo; is a type of waveform on an
oscilloscope. So, I opted to purchase an old arcade machine and gut it
out. Unless you are a woodworker, this is the way I'd suggest doing
it. As a bonus, I got all the buttons and controls I needed for free,
and the case even smelled a little like a pizza parlor. (Okay, that
might be my imagination.)
</p><p>
To find used cabinets, look up &ldquo;coin op&rdquo; or
&ldquo;arcade&rdquo; in the phone
book. It was my particular fortune to find a man willing to give me
two used cabinets for $30. I did have to listen to a litany on the
downfall of the arcade generation and how kids these days don't
appreciate the classic games. I think he threw in the second case for
me when I mentioned that I was rebuilding it because I wanted to
relive my youth. He liked that idea almost as much as I did. Keep in
mind that if you happen to get an arcade monitor, it's possible actually to
use it, but it requires more work. For the purpose of this
article, I assume you're using a standard computer monitor.
</p><p>
After I bought my wife flowers and took her out to dinner, I was
allowed to bring one of the cases into the house and start the fun.
My particular case was from an old <span   class="emphasis"><em>Neo-Geo</em></span> game, and I chose to leave
the somewhat damaged decal on the side (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f1.large.jpg"><img src="9732f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You can see the cabinet won't win any beauty
contests, but it's just dripping with nostalgia.
</p></div></div><p>
If you are, in fact, a woodworker, you may want to purchase the
particle board and make a truly custom cabinet. There are designs
and original measurement specifications for some common arcade
machines on <a href="http://www.arcadecontrols.com" target="_self">www.arcadecontrols.com</a>. In fact, that
site has tons
of information on constructing a MAME machine from the ground up, and
it's an invaluable Web site. To be honest though, even if I were able to start
from scratch, I actually prefer the used cabinet. There's something
special about knowing it's the real deal, even if the insides are all
different.
</p><p>
The most difficult part of construction, for me, was getting the
monitor properly mounted. I used an old 17" Apple monitor that was
destined for the trash. As you can see in Figure 2, the monitor shelf
has to be at the right angle so that the face of the screen is flush
with the Plexiglas front. I'm sure there are woodworking shortcuts
for figuring out how to get the angle correct, but I ended up with
some really complicated geometry equations involving SINE and COSINE.
Yep, I'm a geek.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f2.large.jpg"><img src="9732f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. I most likely could have gotten just as close
with a guess, but I must confess a lot of math went into the angle
calculation for this shelf!
</p></div></div><p>
The shelf below is to hold the computer. All I did there was line up
the shelf with the coin door in the front, so I could reach in to
power the computer on and off. (The coin mechanism
actually can be wired and used, but mine was broken, so I never
installed it. Maybe next time.)
</p><p>
The last bit of woodworking is the most complicated. You must decide
what button layout you desire. I'm the kind of person who spends 20
minutes looking at a dinner menu, so a decision like this was
bordering on impossible for me to make. I read, I Googled, I
compared and I surveyed. My suggestion is that you avoid all that and
go with the layout I chose. Why? Because it works for most games,
and you can always change it later. Figure 3 shows the button layout I
chose, which happens to be a standard <span   class="emphasis"><em>Street Fighter
II</em></span> layout.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f3.large.jpg"><img src="9732f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. I really was lucky with the free buttons I got
with the cabinets. I couldn't have planned the colors any better if I
tried. You'll see evidence of my woodworking shortcomings by the
extra hole I drilled.
</p></div></div><p>
You'll notice an extra joystick in the middle, which is not part of
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Street Fighter</em></span> layout. It's an original
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ms. Pac-Man</em></span> joystick that
my wife got as a belated high-school graduation gift. (We're an odd
family.) It's wired directly to the player-one joystick, so don't
worry if you don't have such a beast, it's not really additional, just
an alternate. 
</p><p>
The joystick and button holes will vary in size, but
standard buttons use 1 1/8" holes. Feel free to lay the buttons out
however you like. I went out of my way to make sure the buttons were
perfectly placed, but there aren't rules for these things. Don't
forget a button for inserting coins! Mine is sticking out of the
front of the machine, about where you'd put in a quarter if it were an
actual arcade.
</p><p>
Now you should have a mostly empty case with a monitor shelf,
computer shelf and a wooden control panel full of holes. If you are
doing this work in the house, and you happen to be married, take this
time to vacuum. You can thank me later.
</p><p>
If you are the artistic type and want to paint the control panel and
cabinet, go ahead and do so. I couldn't wait, and to this day my
cabinet has a raw-wood control panel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e00580.0x1ef9210"></a>
Goodbye Keyboard, Hello Solder</h2></div></div><p>
This is where the magic happens. If you're anything like me, you've
already tried MAME on your computer and played the classic games with
your keyboard. It's fun, but it's definitely not the same as the original.
In this step, we connect the real arcade controls to the computer.
First, if you weren't lucky enough to get used joysticks and
buttons on the cabinet, you need to buy some. There are a few
places to buy arcade controls, but one of the most popular is Happ
Controls (<a href="http://www.happcontrols.com" target="_self">www.happcontrols.com</a>). If you check out the controls
section of the Arcade Controls Web site mentioned previously, you'll find a plethora of
vendors for such things.
</p><p>
Once you have the actual buttons and joysticks, you need to decide
whether you want to buy a keyboard encoder or hack a keyboard
yourself. The former option is easier and more reliable, but the latter
offers a certain geeky charm. I chose the latter. There are very in-depth instructions on the Arcade Controls Web site regarding how to
figure out button layouts properly, but see the Keyboard Hacking sidebar for a quick
description, so you can decide for yourself which way to
go. If you do choose to hack a keyboard, I encourage you to come
up with a better way to connect the wires than I did. Figure 4 shows
my horrible rat's nest of wires. It's ugly, but it works.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f4.large.jpg"><img src="9732f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. This photo pretty much speaks for itself. It's
a great example of how not to organize wires.
</p></div></div><p>
Whether you choose to create your own keyboard controller or purchase
one from a place like Hagstrom Electronics, you still have to
connect the wires to the arcade controls. Because I'm terrible at
woodworking, you'd think there would be a certain balance in the
universe that would suggest I could solder well. Let me assure you
that balance does not exist. I thought it would be really great to
avoid soldering to all the buttons. I bought some spade connectors
that would slide right onto the terminals (Figure 5). Although the
idea still sounds great, it turns out that the microswitches in the
buttons and joysticks really need a solid connection. Unless you want
to take apart your control panel to wiggle wires every so often (like
me), I highly suggest you solder everything. Invite a friend, because
I'm under the opinion that soldering takes three hands. Perhaps your two hands
are better than mine, but at least the friend can hold a light.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f5.large.jpg"><img src="9732f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. My goal was to avoid soldering. The spade
plugs look great, but they honestly don't make a very good
connection&mdash;another example of what not to do.

How Many GHz to Emulate 2.5MHz?</h2></div></div><p>
So now, you should have a cabinet, mounted controls, some sort of
keyboard interface and an empty shelf waiting for a computer. The
last step is to put in a computer and install the software. The
horsepower you'll need really depends on what games you want to play.
If you are planning to play the classics, like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Asteroids</em></span>, a
Pentium II should suffice. If, however, you want to play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Street
Fighter II</em></span>, or any newer games, you should get a Pentium III or 4. I
have a middle-of-the-road Pentium 4. If you want my advice,
I'd say to use what you've got. If you feel the need to invest more
later, you always can do so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e00580.0x1ef99f8"></a>
It's Penguin Time!</h2></div></div><p>
To run MAME in an arcade cabinet, you must configure two separate
programs: MAME itself and a front end. Because MAME is a command-line
program, you need a front end to launch the games with the joysticks and
buttons. This last step is really my favorite part. If you thought
my indecisiveness regarding the button layout was excessive, you
don't want to know how long I spent determining what software to run.
Obviously, I chose to run Linux. Check out the Options sidebar for some
comparisons on a few common choices regarding distros and front ends.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e00580.0x1ef9b00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Options</b></p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Software: AdvanceCD, custom Linux install.</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pros: creates a custom CD or bootable USB key that boots directly into
the AdvanceMENU front end.
</p></li><li><p>
Cons: really tough to configure if you don't use the standard button
layouts. If your hardware isn't detected properly, it's also hard to
fix. Also it's kind of slow, especially if booting from USB 1.1.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Software: LinCade, based on Gentoo.</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pros: also uses the nice AdvanceMENU front end, and it's a little more
configurable, with the option to add and modify games after the
install.
</p></li><li><p>
Cons: still very difficult to configure if you don't use the standard
MAME button layout.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Software: KnoppixMame, based on Knoppix.</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pros: great hardware detection.
</p></li><li><p>
Cons: really not designed for an arcade cabinet, but rather for
someone with a keyboard and mouse.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Software: standard Ubuntu and WahCade front end.</b></span>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pros: very easy to configure. The Ubuntu install handles all the hardware
detection. This is the option I chose.
</p></li><li><p>
Cons: not specifically designed for an arcade cabinet.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
I chose to install a stock Ubuntu distribution. Really any distro
would have worked, but I just happen to like Ubuntu's single CD install.
Also, the WahCade front end has a really nice .deb installer, so
Ubuntu's Debian roots really made sense. First, install Ubuntu like a
normal desktop user. I chose to install Feisty Fawn, because it's the
most recent release, and I happened to have a CD already burned. I'd
highly suggest running the installation using the same monitor you
plan to use in the arcade cabinet. It will save a lot of hassle later
on.
</p><p>
After Ubuntu is installed, open up a terminal window, and install
xMame (the X Window System version of MAME):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo apt-get install xmame-x
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, go to <a href="http://www.anti-particle.com" target="_self">www.anti-particle.com</a> and get the latest version of
WahCade. You'll want to get the .deb file. To install it, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo dpkg -i wahcade-xxx.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you're ready to configure things. The installation instructions
at the WahCade home page are pretty clear, but make sure to follow them
carefully. You'll have to do a few command-line things and figure
out where you want to store ROMs and such. There is a really nice GUI
configuration tool, in which you can assign the proper keys (from your
joysticks) to control the interface. Once you have the front end
configured and ROMs in place, which admittedly will take a while, go
ahead and fire up WahCade. Make sure to add the -fullscreen and
-skip_disclaimer options for xmame, the latter because it's difficult
to type OK with just a joystick. (MAME displays a disclaimer by
default that forces you to type OK in order to continue.)
</p><p>
If everything is configured correctly, you should see the WahCade
program and be able to select and launch games accordingly
(Figure 6). I hate to admit this, but I spent <span   class="emphasis"><em>hours</em></span> trying to figure out how
to configure the buttons for xmame. I tried to edit config files, but
it was too complicated for me to figure out. In the end, it turns out
MAME has a built-in method for reassigning keys. When I realized how
simple it really was, I could have kicked myself. I still might.
Simply press the Tab key once you're inside a game, and you get a nice
configuration screen where you can configure either the default keys
or the game-specific keys.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9732f6.large.jpg"><img src="9732f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Here's the main WahCade screen. This
screenshot was provided by Andy Balcombe, the WahCade developer.
Thanks Andy!
</p></div></div><p>
One of the beauties of MAME is that it's possible to assign a command
to a combination keystroke. For example, I didn't want to install a
button just to exit a game, so I mapped &ldquo;exit game&rdquo; to pressing Player
1 and Player 2 simultaneously. It really limits the amount of buttons
needed. MAME also has an option to pause, which is something the
original arcade never had, but it's very nice for home use. The
yellow button on my control panel is mapped to pause.
</p><p>
Once MAME and WahCade are working, you need to automate the process.
Set the GNOME login manager to log in the user account automatically,
and create an .xsession file that avoids the GNOME environment and
launches WahCade directly. Here's an example of how to create an
.xsession file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat &gt; ~/.xsession
# wahcade
# ^D  (actually press control-D)
#
# chmod +x ~/.xsession (this makes it executable)
</pre>
</p><p>
So there you have it, an arcade system, complete with real controls
and original games. You can customize your system to fit your needs.
Perhaps you want a headphone jack, so you can play without disturbing
others. Maybe you want to add music support and have your arcade
machine double as a jukebox. Because the cabinet has a full computer
with Linux under the hood, the possibilities are really endless. Have
fun!

Obtaining Legal ROMs</b></p><p>
MAME ROMs are easily located for download on the Internet, but the
legality of using those ROMs are questionable. There are a couple
ways to ensure that you have the legal right to your ROMs.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Buy the actual motherboard from the original game. This may sound
far fetched, but it's not too difficult to purchase broken arcade
boards from either local coin-op vendors or on-line from eBay. Because
you're just looking for the legal right to use the downloaded ROM, it
doesn't really matter if the board is broken.
</p></li><li><p>
You can buy the X-Arcade keyboard, which comes with a handful of
classic ROMs.
</p></li><li><p>
Check out <a href="http://arcadecontrols.com" target="_self">arcadecontrols.com</a>. There are some free, noncommercial
games available for download and some more ideas regarding obtaining
legal ROMs. It often is difficult to find whom to buy the rights from,
even if you want to spend the cash.
