    Linux is not Unix, but since Linux is a Unix &ldquo;clone&rdquo;, wars
    in the Unix world affect the Linux world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe24580.0xf1c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>For years, Unix vendors fought each other
for market share by each implementing their own proprietary
extensions to Unix, each trying to use their own extensions to sell
their version of Unix&mdash;usually on their own hardware. No one blames
them for competing, but the result was not good for the whole Unix
marketplace. Many slightly different products, which had different
names but somehow were all understood to be Unix, more or less,
bewildered and bothered consumers.
</p><p>Because they recognized the damage this situation could
cause, Unix vendors have been making interesting noises for years
about closer co-operation with each other. Novell bought Unix, then
gave the Unix trademark to X/Open, to create an open branding
process in order to help bring the Unix world together. X/Open then
released the Single Unix Specification, to which all vendors'
versions of Unix are required to conform in order to use the
trademark. To an amazing extent, this has been a success; quite a
few products that could not use the trademark before have now been
&ldquo;branded&rdquo;.</p><p>Last fall, at Unix Expo, HP and SCO announced that they were
working together to buy Unix development rights from Novell, and
that they were going to develop the new standard 64-bit Unix. While
several versions of Unix have been more or less 64-bit in the past,
the Single Unix Specification (SUS) does not explicitly address
64-bit issues, and SCO and HP (especially HP) were going to supply
the Unix world with 64-bit Unix.</p><p>This was expected to provide the Unix world with,
essentially, 64-bit additions to the SUS, which would be
implemented in every 64-bit version of Unix.</p><p>The careful reader will have already noted my use of the past
tense. Welcome to reality in the Unix world. SCO and HP recently
made it quite clear that they intend for their extensions and
additions to be available only from SCO and HP. They will provide
the whole Unix world with a unified 64-bit Unix, all right,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>provided</em></span> that everyone uses
<span   class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> operating system on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> hardware. Welcome back to market
fragmentation&mdash;called &ldquo;product differentiation&rdquo; by the spin
doctors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe24580.0xf1c608"></a>Yes, This is Relevant</h2></div></div><p>No, this isn't just a tale of woe. The Linux community used
to be unified because of a simple lack of need for competition.
Now, Linux distributions are somewhat differentiated, but most
Linux vendors work together, recognizing that their long-term
chances of survival are far better working together than fighting.
Unlike the Unix community, the Linux community has stayed generally
unified in the face of commercial interest.</p><p>Linux, though it started out as a toy, has for some time been
real competition for &ldquo;Real Unix&rdquo;. Ignoring the licensing issues
for the moment, Linux looks a lot like a vendor-differentiated
version of Unix. While a few Unix versions have extra features that
Linux does not (yet), such as journaling file systems, process
migration, and fail-over server capability (See
<span   class="bold"><b><a href="1272s1.html" target="_self">Huh?</a></b></span>),
Linux has features that distinguish it as well. For example, Linux
has high-quality networking with support for many protocols; few
commercial versions of Unix can provide Novell, Appletalk, SMB, and
AX.25 in addition to standard TCP/IP networking.</p><p>Linux also uses memory frugally; with Linux, it is perfectly
reasonable to use a machine with only 4MB of RAM&mdash;with most
versions of Unix, that's not even enough to boot, let alone do
useful work. Linux has more complete hardware support, especially
for legacy hardware, than most (all?) versions of Unix for Intel
x86 computers. Linux distributions usually include far more
application software than is generally included in a Unix
distribution. And, last but not least, Linux comes with source
code.</p><p>Most versions of Unix support one, or at most two different
CPU architectures. Sun's Solaris supports SPARC and Intel x86.
SGI's Irix supports MIPS. SCO supports Intel x86. Digital Unix
supports the Alpha. Linux currently supports Intel x86, Alpha,
SPARC, Motorola 68K, PowerPC, MIPS, and Acorn ARM. The source code
is now designed to make adding new architectures easy.</p><p>Linux is also now a 64-bit operating system. More properly,
it is mostly bit-size-independent; it operates as a 32-bit
operating system on a 32-bit CPU, a 64-bit operating system on a
64-bit CPU, and on a 16-bit CPU, the subset of Linux that can be
fit into memory operates as a 16-bit operating system (see
<a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/Linux8086.html" target="_self">www.linux.org.uk/Linux8086.html</a>).</p><p>Ignoring license issues, Linux and the various versions of
Unix are pretty similar; they have the same core functionality, and
each has a few extensions or features which differentiate
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe24580.0xf1c9d0"></a>Potential</h2></div></div><p>But licensing issues cannot be ignored. For every CPU that
Linux supports, Unix or another clone is available. What Linux
provides that Unix does not is a unified feature set across all the
supported machines. The fact that Linux is licensed under the GPL
means that a feature written on one architecture is available to
the others, unless it is really by nature
architecture-specific&mdash;and <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> few features
are.</p><p>This feature-sharing among architectures helps give Linux the
potential to outstrip Unix development in the long run. It
certainly makes Unix vendors sweat, and with good reason. Linux has
the long-term potential to cause Unix vendors to cooperate more
fully with each other; if they refuse, Linux has the potential to
eat away at a large part of their current markets.</p><p>Caveat venditor.</p></div></div>
