    This article offers a look at the capabilities of CND and
    its market niche.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc2580.0xeba348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The <a href="0117s1.html" target="_self">Caldera
Network Desktop</a> (CND) is not just another Linux
distribution. Some people will be very happy to hear this; others
will be disappointed. Rather than an in-depth product review, this
article offers some first impressions and talks about where CND is
a good fit.
</p><p>Starting in Fall 1993, with the first Yggdrasil release,
Linux has been evolving in the commercial arena. That is, prior to
that time, most newcomers found Linux on the Internet or in the
hands of a friend and worked from there. Yggdrasil changed that,
and other vendors (including Walnut Creek, CraftWorks, and Red Hat)
continue to offer commercial products.</p><p>Like Yggdrasil, a pioneer that took Linux into a different
arena, Caldera has done it again, expanding the possible Linux
market into a whole new area. What needs to be addressed is: what
is this new market, and who, along with Caldera, will need to get
involved to service this market? But before we get into that, here
are my initial experiences with installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc2580.0xeba558"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>When I opened the package I found a manual, a CD in a jewel
case, a very skinny mouse pad (that gets mixed reviews in our
office), and two floppy disks. I was pleased to find the floppies
but very surprised there were only two, since Red Hat (which
Caldera is based on) uses two root disks plus a boot floppy that
you must select from 72 possible choices.</p><p>It turns out Caldera is using a new installation system and
only one floppy is required. One of the two is for standard
computers, the other is for laptops with PCMCIA cards.</p><p>I quickly thumbed through the manual as I searched for some
free disk space on biggie, the machine I have used to load and test
most of the Linux distributions on the planet. The documentation
looks good, covering most of what you need to know without becoming
a text for techno-nerds.</p><p>I slipped in the boot disk and CD and booted up the system.
It came up to a boot screen where I entered my one required
boot-time parameter so my SCSI controller could be found. All
worked well and I was ready to start answering questions.</p><p>Without going into great detail, LISA (Linux Installation and
System Administration) is a text-mode installation system that was
very easy to use and asked the right number of questions. By that I
mean, if something needs to be asked, it is, but users aren't
pelted with questions about things they might not care about or
understand.</p><p>All went well until the X installation. At that point the
system refused to believe I had an S3-based video board and kept
defaulting to VGA mode. The board I have is a brand-X, but I have
it running fine under Slackware, Red Hat and Yggdrasil.</p><p>I finally gave up and changed to a name-brand video board
that was one of the choices on the X configuration menu and all
worked fine. The X server is X Inside, which is, I understand from
talking to others, very good and fast. While it supports cards that
are not supported by the free server (like the Matrox line) it has
a reputation for not liking some clone cards.</p><p>At this point, I decided I needed to try installing CND on
another computer to see how well it worked. I chose my Toshiba
T3600 notebook which is currently running Slackware 2.3. I plugged
in a New Media BusToaster card and SCSI CD-ROM drive and booted it
up from the PCMCIA floppy. After booting, it asked me to insert my
PCMCIA card, wait five seconds and press return. I did. It
successfully identified the card, but then died because the module
to talk to the card was not on the boot disk. While I could have
found the module, made another boot disk, and tried again, I
decided to quit and hope that version 1.1 addresses that
problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc2580.0xeba8c8"></a>Once It Is Running...</h2></div></div><p>On boot after installation, all came up fine. My only
complaint is that it starts about every possible server and daemon
in the world. While this does make it easy for people who don't
know what they want, it also means editing rc files for those who
need to streamline their system.</p><p>Once CND is up and running, it offers a drag and drop
desktop. But, you already know that from the reviews of the preview
version and the Caldera ads. So, once again, I wanted to make it do
all the stuff I had been doing with other Linux distributions, and
my first effort was to get my PPP link back up and running.</p><p>There was no GUI-based setup for PPP, so I looked in the
manual. Sure enough, PPP was in the index. The reference basically
said to read the PPP HOWTO (which is on the CD). This wasn't fatal,
as I merely copied the PPP stuff I had under Slackware over and it
worked fine. But again, there was nothing easier about setting it
up under CND.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc2580.0xebaa80"></a>The New Market</h2></div></div><p>While the information above may sound depressing, I don't
really feel that it is. While Joe Average may want to convince his
wife that CND is a good buy because it looks like MS Windows, I
don't think this is the primary market. If Caldera hired me to be
their marketing manager, I would tell them their markets are the
office desktop and custom office situations. They don't have to
hire me to do this, though, as it appears they already know. For
example, they have established Value Added Reseller (VAR) and
Independent Software Vendor (ISV) programs.</p><p>If I wanted to get Linux into the office market, I could pick
a particular segment of the office market (like education, medical
office, etc.), develop the packages needed (probably some sort of
database), get up to speed installing CND, and start selling a
bunch of software.</p><p>Better yet, pick some specific hardware and get into the
market with a total hardware/software solution. Also, since CND
includes commercial NetWare client and administration tools,
getting CND on desktops in a Novell-based office makes a lot of
sense.</p><p>In conclusion, CND is not another Slackware or Red Hat. It is
designed for the end-user, &ldquo;I don't know what a Linux is&rdquo; market.
With one hundred million or more PCs out there, CND has a very good
chance to move Linux into new places.</p></div></div>
