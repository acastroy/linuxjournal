    Your Linux computer can be made to do the right thing at the
    right time.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdf72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux utilities
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> are related commands. The cron
utility allows you to schedule a repetitive task to take place at
any regular interval desired, and the at command lets you specify a
one-time action to take place at some desired time. You might use
crontab, for example, to perform a backup each morning at 2 a.m.,
and use at to remind yourself of an appointment later in the day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdf74a8"></a>Using crontab</h2></div></div><p>The word &ldquo;crontab&rdquo; is a Unixism for &ldquo;chron table&rdquo;, or
time table. You create a table in the required format, specifying
commands and times to execute the commands. Commands you put in the
table can be any executable programs&mdash;for example, a command in
/usr/bin or a shell script you wrote. You use the crontab command
to create, edit, or list the table, and the system cron daemon
reads the table and executes the commands at the times
specified.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdf75b0"></a>The cron Daemon</h2></div></div><p>The cron daemon is normally executed at system startup and
does not exit. On my Linux system, the cron daemon is actually
Matthew Dillon's <span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span>, and is
started in /etc/rc.d/rc.M with the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/crond -l10 &gt;/var/adm/cron 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>On some Linux systems, Paul Vixie's cron daemon is used, in
which case the name of the daemon is simply
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>. Also, on systems with newer
versions of init, cron is started from the /etc/init.d/cron
script.</p><p>You can check to see if a cron daemon is running on your
system with a command such as the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ps -ax | grep cron
raithel  733  pp0 S   0:00 grep cron
root      25   ?  S   0:00 /usr/sbin/crond -l10
</pre><p>In this case, we see that the
<span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span> daemon is indeed
running.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdf7978"></a>The crontab Table</h2></div></div><p>When the cron daemon starts, it reads the various crontab
tables in the crontab directory, normally /usr/spool/cron/crontabs.
To create or change your crontab file, use crontab's
<span   class="bold"><b>-e</b></span> option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ crontab -e
</pre><p>You are placed in a text editor with a copy of your current
crontab file, if it exists, or a blank file, if it does not. The
text editor you get is determined by the setting of your
<b  >VISUAL</b> environment variable (or
<b  >EDITOR</b>, if <b  >VISUAL</b> is not set)
and is usually the <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> editor, if
you have not specified otherwise.</p><p>To schedule commands with crontab, you must use the format
cron recognizes in a crontab file. The format is not exactly
mnemonic, so I create a crontab file with a header commented out
that provides the necessary information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# minute (0-59),
#    hour (0-23),
#       day of the month (1-31),
#          month of the year (1-12),
#             day of the week (0-6, 0=Sunday),
#                command
</pre><p>Each crontab entry is a single line composed of these six
fields, separated by white space. Specify the minute a command is
to be executed with the digits 0 through 59 in the first field, the
hour with 0 through 23 in the second field, the day of the month
with 1 through 31 in the third field, the month of the year with 1
through 12 in the fourth field, and the day of the week with 0
through 6 in the fifth field. Place the command to be executed in
the sixth field.</p><p>At first glance it may appear that redundant or conflicting
information is required because there are two &ldquo;day&rdquo; fields&mdash;day
of the month and day of the week, but this is really just to permit
different scheduling algorithms. For instance, you may want to be
reminded to attend a meeting every Tuesday or to pick up your
paycheck every 15th of the month. Enter an asterisk (*) in the day
field you are not using. You can use both day fields if you prefer
to have the command execute on, say, the fifteenth of the month
<span   class="bold"><b>as well as</b></span> every Tuesday.</p><p>Ranges are specified with a dash. If you want to specify the
eighth through the fifteenth days of the month, enter
<b  >8-15</b> in the third field. Non-consecutive entries
in a field are separated by commas, so <b  >1,15</b> in
the third field means the first and fifteenth of the month. To
specify all values for a field, for example every month of the
year, enter an asterisk (<b  >*</b>) in the field. (Note
that to specify every day you must enter <b  >*</b> in
<span   class="bold"><b>both</b></span> day fields.)</p><p>Here is an example crontab file with two entries:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# minute (0-59),
#   hour (0-23),
#      day of the month (1-31),
#            month of the year (1-12),
#               day of the week (0-6, 0=Sunday)
#                  command
12  4  *     *  *  /usr/local/bin/backup
5   3  10-15 4  *  echo "taxes due" | mail jones
</pre><p>The first line after the comments causes a backup script to
execute early each morning at 4:12 a.m., and the second line causes
the user jones to get a mail message for six days in April as a
reminder that taxes are due. In general, it's a good idea to
execute crontab commands at off hours like these to reduce any
effect on system load during normal usage hours.</p><p>If you don't specifically redirect standard error and
standard output, they are mailed to you as owner of the crontab
file when the command executes. In the example above, if the user
jones cannot be found, you would be mailed the output as well as an
error message.</p><p>After editing the crontab file, save it and exit from the
editor. A file is created for you in the crontab directory. For
example, the crontab for root is the file
/usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root. This file is read by the system cron
daemon and stored in an internal format, where it will remain to be
periodically executed until it is changed or deleted.</p><p>To view your current crontab file, use the
<b  >-l</b> (for &ldquo;list&rdquo;) option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ crontab -l
</pre><p>To delete your file, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ crontab -d
</pre><p>If you are superuser, you can delete any user's crontab file
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# crontab -d <span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>username</tt></i></b>
is the user's login name.</p><p>The crontab commands discussed above work fine on my Linux
system and should work on System V and BSD Unix systems, as well.
One thing to be aware of when using crontab on other systems or
moving crontab files to other systems is that some cron daemons
allow the superuser to restrict crontab service by the creation of
cron.allow and cron.deny files. Refer to the specific system
documentation for details.</p><p>Also, most versions of cron provide an /etc/crontab file
which has an extra field in it&mdash;the user as which to execute the
command. Again, check the documentation for your version of cron
for more details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdf86e0"></a>Using at</h2></div></div><p>Use <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> when you want to
execute a command or multiple commands once at some future
time.</p><p>In Linux, the at command requires that the atrun command be
started in root's crontab file. Many Linux distributions ship with
at enabled, but some do not. To enable the at utility on your
system, become superuser and edit root's crontab file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ su root
Password:
# crontab -e
</pre><p>and add the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
* * * * * <span   class="emphasis"><em>directory</em></span>/atrun
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>directory</tt></i></b>
is the location where the atrun executable is stored. On my system
that's /usr/lib, so the entry is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
* * * * * /usr/lib/atrun
</pre><p>This causes atrun to be executed every minute. After a minute
or so of adding the atrun line and saving the crontab file, any
existing at commands are evaluated and executed if the time is
right. (Before this, you may have been able to enter at commands,
but they were never executed.)</p><p>To demonstrate the at command, let's have it print &ldquo;hello&rdquo;
on your current terminal window after a few minutes. First, get the
time and your current terminal device:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ date
Tue Oct  3 15:33:37 PDT 1995
$ tty
/dev/ttyp2
</pre><p>Now run the at command. Specify a time in the command line,
press Return, and then enter the command, followed by another
Return and a Ctrl-D:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at 15:35
echo "hello" &gt; /dev/ttyp2
^D
Job c00ceb20b.00 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre><p>The at command takes input up to the end-of-file character
(generated by pressing ctrl-D while at the beginning of a line.) It
reports the job number and informs you that it will use /bin/sh to
execute the command. In two minutes, <b  >hello</b>
should appear on the display of /dev/ttyp2. Note that you can enter
a series of commands, one per line&mdash;at will read each line up to
the end-of-file and execute the file as a /bin/sh shell script at
the specified time.</p><p>Suppose you want to set an alarm. One way to tell at to do
something is to use the relative form of timing, specifying a time
relative to <b  >now</b>. If you want your computer to
beep at you in 25 minutes, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at now + 25 minutes
echo ^G &gt; /dev/ttyp4
^D
Job c00ceb7fb.00 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre><p>and you are beeped in 25 minutes. There is a great deal of
flexibility allowed in entering time specifications. For example,
at recognizes military time, &ldquo;am&rdquo; and &ldquo;pm&rdquo;, month
abbreviations, time notation that includes the year, and so on. My
at man page even claims at accepts <b  >teatime</b>,
<b  >noon</b>, and other constructs. Refer to the at man
page for more examples of valid time specifications.</p><p>You must tell at your tty location, or it won't send output
to your terminal window. If you prefer, you can receive
mail:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at 4:55pm Friday
echo '5 p.m. meeting with Carol' | mail raithel
^D
Job c00ceb7fb.01 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre><p>To get a list of your pending at jobs, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ atq
</pre><p>If you are superuser, atq shows you the pending at jobs of
all users. To delete a job, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ atrm <span   class="emphasis"><em>job_number</em></span>
</pre><p>where
<b  ><i><tt>job_number</tt></i></b> is the job
number returned by atq. The superuser can also remove other user's
jobs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdefbd0"></a>A Reminder Script Using at</h2></div></div><p>The following is a simple script that makes it easier for me
to use at to send myself reminders. The script sends mail to the
user containing the message line(s) entered at the prompt at the
time specified. It also displays some syntax examples of how to
specify time, which I find a useful memory refresher.</p><p>Notice the script, as written, requires you to have a Msgs
directory in your home directory. I created $HOME/Msgs, rather than
using something like /usr/tmp, so the messages are more private
until they are deleted by the script.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
echo "Enter your reminder message.
When finished, enter a period (.) at
the beginning of a line and press Enter.
(Or press Ctrl-C or DEL to exit.)"
while :
do
    read MESSAGE
    if [ "$MESSAGE" = "." ]
    then
        break
    else
        echo $MESSAGE &gt; $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
    fi
done
cat &lt;&lt; !!
Enter time and day you want to receive
the message, for example:
      0815am Jan 24
      8:15am Jan 24
      now + 1 day
      5 pm Friday
Then press Enter.
!!
read TIME
echo \
  "at $TIME mail $LOGNAME $HOME/Msgs/message.$$"
at $TIME  &lt;&lt; !!
mail $LOGNAME &lt; $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
rm -f $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
!!
exit 0
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcff580.0xdefd88"></a>Some Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>The user's interface to the crontab and at commands is very
similar across different versions of Unix, but implementations of
underlying directory structures, daemons, and access controls may
differ. Be sure to review your system documentation to take
advantage of all aspects of these powerful commands.</p><p>There's practically no limit to the use of crontab and at,
but let me offer a few words of warning. First, consider security
issues when enabling user crontab and at permissions. Obviously, a
disgruntled co-worker could leave a &ldquo;time-bomb&rdquo; of some sort,
limited only by his other permission restrictions. Many versions of
crontab and at allow you to specify &ldquo;allow&rdquo; and &ldquo;deny&rdquo; files to
control which users have access to the utilities. You could also
use root's crontab to check for and remove user crontabs (or any
other files) if you want to.</p><p>Also, debug your crontab file entries thoroughly. Check that
they are working. These entries are usually scheduled to execute at
times of low-usage, so it is unlikely you'll be around to observe
them at the time.</p><p>John Raithel is a consulting technical writer specializing in
