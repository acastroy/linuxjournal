heard of the MySQL relational database server from TcX
DataKonsultAB, of 0. It's free, easy to install, works like a
champ, and has had excellent treatment by Reuven Lerner in his
column, At the Forge (see <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
August 2000).
</p><p>Many first-time MySQL users, upon reading the MySQL manual
which comes with the source code, have undoubtedly balked at the
manual's instructions on creating a new user:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
VALUES('localhost'bill'PASSWORD('semperfi'n&gt;
      'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'Y'
</pre><p>The SQL &ldquo;create user&rdquo; and &ldquo;grant...&rdquo; commands work with
MySQL too, but they require typing practically as meticulous as the
above. At this point, some of us have lamented the lack of a
graphical front end to all this. Something like Oracle's
<span   class="bold"><b>svrmgrm</b></span> utility would sure be
nice.
</p><p>Happily, there is a graphical client for MySQL, and it's
available from the same people who make MySQL. It's called
mysqlgui. There are some other graphical interfaces to MySQL, for
example, xmysql and xmysqladmin, but MySQLGUI is unique in that it
performs both client and administrative operations in a single
package.</p><p>None of the books currently available on MySQL mention
MySQLGUI at all. Even the MySQL.com web site does not give it any
attention. I came upon it by chance at the MySQL web site and
decided to download it and give it a try.</p><p>MySQLGUI is available in three formats: source code, static
binary and semi-static binary. I got the static binary, and it has
worked fine. Although the accompanying documentation stresses that
MySQLGUI is beta software, I haven't managed to crash it
yet.</p><p>MySQLGUI is the work of Sinisia Milivojevic, of Larnaka,
Cyprus. He reports that MySQLGUI actually has a large base of users
worldwide. Its status as beta software notwithstanding, MySQLGUI is
very stable&mdash;almost devoid of known bugs. It is built with the fltk
library. TcX are planning a new GUI client within the coming year,
one based on the QT or GTK libraries instead. The basic look may
change somewhat in the new version, but all functionality will be
retained.</p><p>Although the documentation on MySQLGUI is a bit spartan, its
built-in functionality is rich indeed. You have to get it up and
running and experiment with it to appreciate it. It quickly becomes
apparent that a great deal of thought and planning went into
MySQLGUI's development. Here is a brief synopsis of MySQLGUI's
features.</p><p>Assuming you have MySQL server installed and running, you
need only download the MySQLGUI source or binary and run mysqlgui
from an xterm.</p><p>The MySQL Client greeting displays, followed by a user
password dialog. After entering the user's password (if any), the
MySQL Client main dialog takes over. It is the master control panel
from which all other tools are launched. It also is where you can
connect to the server, select a database, and run interactive
queries against one or more tables. Figure 1 shows the main dialog
with a user connected, a table selected, a query entered and the
query results displayed. Clicking on the column headings in the
query results window will sort the results based on that column's
values. The first click sorts ascending, a second click sorts
descending, and a third click unsorts. Saving the optionally sorted
results to a file is a simple click away (see Figure 1). This ad
hoc sorting functionality saves many keystrokes when compared to
the MySQL command line client. Any SQL command can be executed in
the query input field&mdash;not just queries. And the commands entered
are saved in the lower command history area, where they may be
recalled and re-executed later (even in subsequent
sessions).</p><p>

</p><p>MySQLGUI really shines when working with users. For this
purpose, it has the Grant/Revoke tool. Figure 2 shows us about to
create a new user, &ldquo;annette&rdquo;. She will have select, insert,
update, and delete privileges on the &ldquo;cigars&rdquo; database on
localhost. This is much easier, faster and more intuitive than
either of the command-line procedures above. One thing perhaps not
obvious is that we use the Grant/Revoke tool to create a new user.
There is no Create User tool. However, doing it this way allows you
to create a user and grant her privileges all in one shot.
MySQLGUI, like the MySQL server, was designed to be fast, not
fancy. Similar tools enable creating/dropping databases, tables and
indices.</p><p>

</p><p>Another useful tool is Table 0. Given time, you can
accumulate a lot of databases and tables. Tables often have similar
names. Figure 3 shows the database and table 0 tool. It allows you
to browse all the databases and tables on your computer. This is
quite useful, and I tend to keep this window open all the time when
working with MySQLGUI.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4286f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Table 0 Tool</p></div></div>
</p><p>I have touched on just a few of MySQLGUI's main features
here. Suffice to say that it can perform any operation that one can
perform with the command-line client. For simply issuing queries
and sorting through your data, it may be all you need. And if
you're a developer, it can cut down time spent formulating queries
and administering your system. MySQLGUI is a first-class piece of
work.</p><p><a href="4286s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
