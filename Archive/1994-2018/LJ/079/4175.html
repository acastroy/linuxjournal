very expensive hockey puck. Imagine you have had a fire, and your
computer case now looks like something Salvador Dal&iacute; would
like to paint. Now what?
</p><p>Bare metal recovery is the process of rebuilding a computer
after a catastrophic failure. This article is a step-by-step
tutorial on how to back up a Linux computer to be able to make a
bare metal recovery, and how to make that bare metal
recovery.</p><p>The normal bare metal restoration process is: install the
operating system from the product disks, install the backup
software (so you can restore your data), and then restore your
data. Then, you get to restore functionality by verifying your
configuration files, permissions, etc.</p><p>The process here will save installing the operating system
product disk. It will also restore only the files that were backed
up from the production computer, so your configuration will be
intact when you restore the system. This should save you hours of
verifying configurations and data.</p><p>The target computer for this article is a Pentium computer
with a Red Hat 5.2 Linux server installation on one IDE hard drive.
It does not have vast amounts of data because the computer was set
up as a &ldquo;sacrificial&rdquo; test bed. That is, I did not want to test
this process with a production computer and production data. Also,
I did a fresh &ldquo;server&rdquo; install before I started the testing so
that I could always reinstall if I needed to revert to a known
configuration.</p><p>The target computer does not have any other operating systems
on it. While it simplifies the exercise at hand, it also means if
you have a dual boot system, you will have to experiment to get the
non-Linux OS to restore.</p><p>The process shown below is not easy. Practice it before you
need it! Do as I did, and practice on a sacrificial
computer.</p><p>Nota Bene: The sample commands will show, in most cases, what
I had to type to recover the target system. You may have to use
similar commands, but with different parameters. For example, below
we show how to make a swap device on /dev/hda9. It is up to you to
be sure you duplicate your setup, and not the test computer's
setup.</p><p>The basic procedure is set out by W. Curtis Preston in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Backup &amp; Recovery</em></span>, (
<a href="http://www.ora.com" target="_self">http://www.ora.com/</a>,
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/unixbr" target="_self">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/unixbr/</a>),
which I favorably reviewed in <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
October 2000. However, the book is a bit thin on the ground. For
example, exactly which files do you back up? What metadata do you
need to preserve, and how?</p><p>We will start with the assumption that you have backed up
your system with a typical backup tool such as Amanda, Bru,
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>, Arkeia or
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span>. The question, then, is how
to get from toasted hardware to the point where you can run the
restoration tool that will restore your data.</p><p>Users of Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)-based Linux
distributions should also save RPM metadata as part of their normal
backups. Something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Va &gt; /etc/rpmVa.txt
</pre><p>in your backup script will give you a basis for comparison
after a bare metal restoration.
</p><p>To get to this point, you need to have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Your hardware up and running again, with
replacement components as needed. The BIOS should be correctly
configured, including time, date and hard drive parameters.</p></li><li><p>A parallel port Iomega Zip drive or equivalent. You
will need at least 30MB of space.</p></li><li><p>Your backup media.</p></li><li><p>A minimal Linux system that will allow you to run
the restoration software.</p></li></ul></div><p>To get there, you need at least two stages of backup, and
possibly three. Exactly what you back up and in which stage you
back it up is determined by your restoration process. For example,
if you are restoring a tape server, you may not need networking
during the restoration process, so only back up networking in your
regular backups.
</p><p>You will restore in stages as well. In stage one, we build
partitions, file systems, etc., and restore a minimal file system
from the Zip disk. The goal of stage one is to be able to boot a
running computer with a network connection, tape drives,
restoration software or whatever we need for stage two.</p><p>The second stage, if it is necessary, consists of restoring
backup software and any relevant databases. For example, suppose
you use Arkeia and build a bare metal recovery Zip disk for your
backup server. Arkeia keeps a huge database on the server's hard
drives. You can recover the database from the tapes, if you want.
Instead, why not tar and <span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> the
whole Arkeia directory (at /usr/knox), and save that to another
computer over nfs? Stage one, as we have defined it, does not
include X, so you will have some experimenting to do to back up X
as well as your backup program.</p><p>Of course, if you are using some other backup program, you
may have some work to do to. You will have to find out which
directories and files it needs to run. If you use tar, gzip, cpio,
<span   class="bold"><b>mt</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span> for your backup and recovery
tools, they will be saved to and restored from our Zip disk as part
of the stage one process described below.</p><p>The last stage is a total restoration from tape or other
media. After you have done that last stage, you should be able to
boot to a fully restored and operational system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x1df40b0"></a>Preparation</h2></div></div><p>First, do your normal backups on their regular schedule. This
article is useless if you don't do that.</p><p>Next, build yourself a rescue disk. I use
<span   class="bold"><b>tomsrtbt</b></span>, available at
<a href="http://www.toms.net/~toehser/rb" target="_self">http://www.toms.net/~toehser/rb/</a>.
It is well documented and packs a lot of useful tools onto one
floppy diskette. There is an active list for it, and the one
question I had was quickly and accurately answered. I like that in
a product my shop may depend on one day.</p><p>Next, figure out how to do the operating system backup you
will need so that you can restore your normal backup. I followed
Preston's advice and used an Iomega parallel port Zip drive. They
get approximately 90MB of useful storage to a disk. Since the
scripts I developed for the stage one backup save about 30MB of
data, one Zip disk should be plenty for the job at hand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x1df4318"></a>Installing the Zip Drive</h2></div></div><p>Much of this is covered in the Zip Drive HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/ZIP-Drive.html" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/ZIP-Drive.html</a>),
so I'll show you exactly what I did. Your mileage may vary. You may
have already done a lot of this, in which case your setup may vary.
For me the procedure was simplified by not having a printer share
the parallel port with the Zip drive.</p><p>First, install the driver for the Zip drive, and make a mount
point for it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# modprobe ppa
[root@tester /etc]# mkdir /mnt/zip
</pre><p>Insert a suitable line into your fstab:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda4       /mnt/zip        vfat    noauto  0 0
</pre>


Save fstab. Put a Zip disk in the drive. Then you should be able to
mount the Zip drive:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# mount /mnt/zip
[root@tester /etc]# ls -l /mnt/zip
total 277
drwxr-xr-x  2 root   root    16384 Dec 31  1969 .

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   265728 Jan 30 1998 50ways.exe
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x1df4630"></a>Putting ex2fs on the Zip Disk</h2></div></div><p>Zip drives come formatted for MS-DOS or Windows (FAT) or the
Mac. The FAT format is somewhat inefficient for what we are doing,
although not fatally so. Our test computer setup put about 26MB
onto the Zip disk, so you can skip installing the ext2fs on your
Zip disk.</p><p>Here is how to replace the FAT file system on the Zip disk
with an ext2fs. First, unmount the Zip drive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# umount /mnt/zip
</pre><p>Then run fdisk and see what you have:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# fdisk /dev/sda

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/sda: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 96 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes

Device Boot     Start   End     Blocks  Id      System
/dev/sda4  *    1       96      98288   6       DOS 16-bit &gt;=32M

Command (m for help):
</pre>


For reasons known only to Murphy and Iomega, FAT Iomega Zip disks
have only one partition, partition four. Delete the offending
partition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): d
Partition number (1-4): 4

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/sda: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 96 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes

Device Boot     Start   End     Blocks  Id      System
</pre>


Per the Zip drive HOWTO, we will make a new partition as partition
1:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): n
Command action
   e   extended
   p   primary partition (1-4)
p
Partition number (1-4): 1
First cylinder (1-96): 1
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK  ([1]-96):  96
</pre>


Displaying the partition table indicates that it was marked as a
Linux ext2fs partition for us, so we don't have to change the file
system id:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/sda: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 96 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes

Device Boot     Start   End     Blocks  Id      System
/dev/sda1       1       96      98288   83      Linux native
</pre>


Use the <span   class="bold"><b>w</b></span> command to write the
partition table and exit. We now have to make a file system on the
freshly minted partition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# mke2fs /dev/sda1
mke2fs 1.12, 9-Jul-98 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Linux ext2 file system format
File system label=
24576 inodes, 98288 blocks
4914 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=1
Block size=1024 (log=0)
Fragment size=1024 (log=0)
12 block groups
8192 blocks per group, 8192 fragments per group
2048 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
  8193, 16385, 24577, 32769, 40961, 49153, 57345,
  65537, 73729, 81921, 90113

Writing inode tables: done
Writing superblocks and file system accounting information: done
</pre>


Now we go back to fstab and add a new entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda1    /mnt/zip    ext2   noauto    0 0
</pre>


This lets us specify which file system we have on the Zip disk by
mounting the device file rather than the mount point. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester /etc]# mount /dev/sda1
</pre>


The order in which you place the two lines in /etc/fstab is
important. The first one determines whether the default partition
mount will try to mount if you specify /mnt/zip. So put this line
above the entry you made earlier. We will use this in the script
that saves the stage one data to the Zip disk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x1df4b00"></a>Creating the Stage One Backup</h2></div></div><p>Having made your production backups, what additional
information do you need to back up in order to rebuild your system?
You need to preserve your partition information so that you can
rebuild them. This and other metadata are preserved in the script
<span   class="bold"><b>save.metadata</b></span> (see Listing
1).</p><p><a href="4175l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
save.metadata</a></p><p>Unfortunately, fdisk does not yet export partition
information in a manner that allows you to reimport it from a file.
Since you have to rebuild your partitions by hand using fdisk, we
will save it as a human-readable text file.</p><p>Fortunately, the price of hard drives is plummeting almost as
fast as the public's trust in politicians after an election. So it
is good that the hand-editing process allows the flexibility
necessary to use a larger replacement drive.</p><p>The script saves the partition information in the file
fdisk.hda in the root of the Zip disk. It is a good idea to print
this file and your /etc/fstab. Then, you can work from hard copy
while you restore the partition data. You can save a tree by
toggling between two virtual consoles, running fdisk in one and
catting /etc/fstab or /fdisk.hda as needed, but this strikes me as
error prone.</p><p>You will also want to preserve files relevant to your
restoration method. For example, if you use nfs to save your data,
you will need to preserve hosts.allow, hosts.deny, exports, etc.
Also, if you are using any network backed restoration process, such
as Amanda or Quick Restore, you will need to preserve networking
files like <b  >HOSTNAME</b>, hosts, etc. and the
relevant software tree.</p><p>The simplest way to handle these and similar questions is to
preserve the entire /etc directory.</p><p>Preston cheats when he backs up his system. There is no way a
100MB Zip drive is going to hold a server installation of Red Hat
5.2. A 250MB Zip disk will hold a fresh server installation, but
probably won't hold a production server. We have to be much more
selective than simply preserving the whole kazoo. What files do we
need?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The boot directory.</p></li><li><p>The /etc directory and subdirectories.</p></li><li><p>Directories needed at boot time.</p></li><li><p>Device files in /dev.</p></li></ul></div><p>To determine the directories needed at boot, we look at the
boot initialization file <b  >/etc/rc.sysinit</b>. It
sets its path like so:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
export PATH
</pre>


Trial and error indicated that we needed some other directories as
well, such as /dev. In retrospect, of course we need /dev. In
Linux, you can't do much without device files.
</p><p>In reading the script save.metadata (see Listing 1), again
note that we aren't necessarily saving files that are called with
absolute paths. We may require several iterations of backup, test
the bare metal restore, reinstall from CD and try again, before we
have a working backup script. While I worked on this article, I
made five such interations before I had a successful restoration.
That is one reason why it is essential to use scripts whenever
possible. Test thoroughly!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x21ed640"></a>Booting tomsrtbt</h2></div></div><p>The first thing to do before starting the restoration process
is to verify that the hardware time is set correctly. Use the BIOS
setup for this. How close to exact you have to set the time depends
on your applications. For restoration, within a few minutes of
exact time should be accurate enough. This will allow time-critical
events to pick up where they left off when you finally launch the
restored system.</p><p>Before booting tomsrtbt, make sure your Zip drive is placed
on a parallel port, either /dev/lp0 or /dev/lp1. The startup
software will load the parallel port Zip drive driver for
you.</p><p>I have one of those ne2000 clone Ethernet cards in my test
system. This, it turns out, gives the 3c59x driver in the tomsrtbt
kernel fits. The workaround is to tell the kernel to ignore its
address range. At the LILO prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zImage reserve=0x300,32
</pre><p>The next step is to set the video mode. I usually like to see
as much on the screen as I can. So when the option to select a
video mode comes, I use mode 6, 80 columns by 60 lines. Your
hardware may or may not be able to handle high resolutions like
that, so experiment with it.
</p><p>Once tomsrtbt has booted and you have a console, mount the
Zip drive. It is probably a good idea to mount it read only:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -o ro
</pre><p>Check to be sure it is there:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ls -l /mnt
</pre>


Then clean out the first two sectors of the hard drive:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=2
</pre>


This sets the master boot record (MBR) to all zeros. It wipes out
all record of the partitions and any boot code, such as LILO.
</p><p>Then, using the hard copy of fdisk.hda you made earlier, use
fdisk to partition the hard drive. Make the first cylinder a
primary partition. After that, you will build one or more extended
partitions with one to four logical partitions. Primary and
extended partitions are numbered one to four. Partitions five and
up are logical partitions. Notice also that the extended partitions
overlap the logical partitions they contain. The partition number
of a partition is the last one or two numbers in the device name,
so /dev/hda5 is partition number five on hda.</p><p>You can have more than one primary partition, but this is
unwise. Each primary partition precludes an extended partition,
which can be subdivided into logical partitions. Extended
partitions are far more flexible:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# fdisk

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hda: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 1023 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes

Device Boot     Start   End     Blocks  Id      System

Command (m for help):
</pre><p>We will make a new partition as partition 1:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): n
Command action
   e   extended
   p   primary partition (1-4)
p
Partition number (1-4): 1
First cylinder (1-1023): 1
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-1023): 9
</pre>


Now we will make the extended partition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): n
Command action
   e   extended
   p   primary partition (1-4)
e
Partition number (1-4): 2
First cylinder (1-1023): 10
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (10-1023): 1022
</pre>


Note that the hard drive has 1,023 cylinders, and we only made the
extended partition go to 1,022, wasting a cylinder. The reason is
that we are duplicating the setup Red Hat gave us on the original
installation.
</p><p>Now for a logical partition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): n
Command action
   l   Logical (5 or over)
   p   primary partition (1-4)
l
First cylinder (10-1022): 10"
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-1022): 368
</pre><p>And so on for each partition that your fdisk.hda file
indicates you should have.
</p><p>Set the file system ID on your swap partition(s) to Linux
Swap (82) using the t command.</p><p>Don't forget to use the a command to set a partition active,
or bootable. In a Linux-only installation, this is usually the
first partition, but can be another one. It will be the partition
that mounts as /boot (see your printout of fstab):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Command (m for help): a

</pre><p>Then, we have to manually build and mount a partition to each
directory. Since what is now /target will eventually become /, we
mount what will be / to /target:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /target
# mount /dev/hda8 /target
</pre>


Next, we build the directories we need in /target, and mount to
them, like so for each directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /target/boot
# mount /dev/hda1 /target/boot
</pre>


You can determine which directories and mountspace points to build
and mount from /mnt/etc/fstab. Fortunately, umask is already set
correctly for almost all the directories we need to build.
</p><p>And so on for each partition. Referring to /mnt/ls.root.txt,
make sure you also set the proper modes for the directories you are
building.</p><p>Do not try to mount the extended or swap partitions, though.
You don't need to, and it won't do you any good, anyway.</p><p>To check your progress, use the command mount with no
parameters.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mount
/dev/ram0 on / type minix (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/ram1 on /usr type minix (rw)
/dev/ram3 on /tmp type minix (rw)
/dev/sda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda8 on /target type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /target/boot type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda6 on /target/home type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda5 on /target/usr type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda7 on /target/var type ext2 (rw)
</pre><p>Once you have created all your directories and mounted
partitions to them, you can run the script
/mnt/root.bin/restore.metadata (see Listing 2). This will restore
the contents of the Zip drive to the hard drive.
</p><p><a href="4175l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Restore script! Zip to
HD</a></p><p>You should see a directory of the Zip disk's root directory,
then a list of the archive files as they are restored.
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> on tomsrtbt will tell you that
tar's block size is 20, and that's fine. You can ignore it. Be sure
that LILO prints out its results:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Added linux *
</pre><p>That will be followed by the output from a <b  >df
-m</b> command.
</p><p>If you normally boot directly to X, that could cause
problems. To be safe, change your boot run level temporarily. In
/etc/inittab, find the line that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:5:initdefault:
</pre><p>and change it to this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault:
</pre>


Now, you can gracefully reboot. Remove the tomsrtbt floppy from
your floppy drive if you haven't already done so, and give the
computer the three-fingered salute, or its equivalent, &ldquo;shutdown
-r now&rdquo;. The computer will shut down and reboot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x21ee820"></a>Second Stage Restoration</h2></div></div><p>As the computer reboots, go back to the BIOS and verify that
the clock is more or less correct.</p><p>Once you have verified the clock, exit the BIOS and reboot,
this time to the hard drive. You will see a lot of error messages,
mostly along the lines of &ldquo;I can't find blah! Waahhh!&rdquo; Well, if
you have done your homework correctly up until now, those error
messages won't matter. You don't need linuxconf or apache to do
what you need to do.</p><p>You should be able to log into a root console (no X, no
users, sorry). You should now be able to use the network, for
example, to NFS mount the backup of your system.</p><p>If you did the two stage backup I suggested for Arkeia, you
can restore Arkeia's database and executables. Now, you should be
able to run <span   class="bold"><b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/arkeia
start</b></span> and start the server. If you have the GUI
installed on another computer with X installed, you should be able
to log in to Arkeia on your tape server, and prepare your
restoration.</p><p>When you restore, read the documentation for your restoration
programs carefully. For example, tar does not normally restore
certain characteristics of files, like suid bits. File permissions
are set by the user's umask. To restore your files exactly as you
saved them, use tar's p option. Similarly, make sure your
restoration software will restore everything exactly as you saved
it.</p><p>To restore the test computer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@tester ~]# restore.all
</pre><p>If you used tar for your backup and restoration, and used the
-k (keep old files, don't overwrite) option, you will see a lot of
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar: usr/sbin/rpcinfo: Could not create file:  File exists
tar: usr/sbin/zdump: Could not create file:  File exists
tar: usr/sbin/zic: Could not create file:  File exists
tar: usr/sbin/ab: Could not create file:  File exists
</pre>


This is normal, as tar is refusing to overwrite files you restored
during the first stage of restoration.
</p><p>Just to be paranoid, run LILO after you perform your
restoration. I doubt it is necessary, but if it is necessary, it's
a lot easier than the alternative. You will notice I have it in my
script, restore.all (see Listing 3).</p><p><a href="4175l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. restore.all
Script</a></p><p>Now reboot. On the way down, you will see a lot of error
messages, such as &ldquo;no such pid.&rdquo; This is a normal part of the
process. The shutdown code is using the pid files from d&aelig;mons
that were running when the backup was made to shut down
d&aelig;mons that were not started on the last boot. Of course
there's no such pid.</p><p>Your system should come up normally, with a lot fewer errors
than it had before. The acid test of how well your restore works on
an RPM based system is to verify all packages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Va
</pre><p>Some files, such as configuration and log files, will have
changed in the normal course of things, and you should be able to
mentally filter those out of the report.
</p><p>If you took my advice earlier and keep RPM metadata as a
normal part of your backup process, you should be able to diff the
two files, thereby speeding up this step considerably.</p><p>You should be up and running. It is time to test your
applications, especially those that run as d&aelig;mons. The more
sophisticated the application, the more testing you may need to do.
If you have remote users, disable them from using the system, or
make it &ldquo;read only&rdquo; while you test it. This is especially
important for databases, to prevent making any corruption or data
loss worse than it already might be.</p><p>If you normally boot to X, and disabled it above, test X
before you re-enable it. Re-enable it by changing that one line in
/etc/inittab back to: <b  >id:5:initdefault:</b></p><p>You should now be ready to rock and roll&mdash;and for some
Aspirin and a couch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x21ef060"></a>Some Advice for Disaster Recovery</h2></div></div><p>You should take your Zip disk for each computer and the
printouts you made, and place them in a secure location in your
shop. You should also store copies of these in your off-site
storage location. The major purpose of off-site backup storage is
to enable disaster recovery, and restoring each host onto
replacement hardware is a part of disaster recovery.</p><p>You should also have several tomsrtbt floppies and possibly
some Zip drives in your off-site storage as well. Have copies of
the tomsrtbt distribution on several of your computers so that they
back each other up. In addition, you should probably keep copies of
this article, with your site-specific annotations on it, with your
backups and in your off-site backup storage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cfb580.0x2100da0"></a>What Now?</h2></div></div><p>This article is the result of experiments on one computer. No
doubt you will find some other directories or files you need to
back up in your first stage backup. I have not dealt with saving
and restoring X on the first stage. Nor have I dealt with other
operating systems in a dual boot system, or with processors other
than Intel.</p><p>I would appreciate your feedback as you test and improve
these scripts on your own computers. I also encourage vendors of
backup software to document how to do a minimal backup of their
products. I'd like to see the whole Linux community sleep just a
little better at night.</p></div></div>
