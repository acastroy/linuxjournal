<i  >Linux Journal</i> (&ldquo;Uncollapsing Open Source
Distinctions: Talking with Craig Burton&rdquo;, p. 16), I said
&ldquo;historically, the Open Source movement has tried to move away
from the Free Software movement's anti-commercial rhetoric and
policies.&rdquo;</p><p>A few days ago I got an e-mail from Richard Stallman, under
the subject &ldquo;Who's anti-commercial?&rdquo;. His answer: not him. And
not the Free Software movement, either:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We do not have anti-commercial rhetoric or
policies, and I'm surprised you would say this.
</p><p>I know why some people say we are &ldquo;anti-commercial&rdquo;. We
criticize a common business practice, and people who do that are
often accused of being &ldquo;anti-commercial&rdquo;. But, the fact is that
if a program does not allow commercial use, or if you can't sell
copies, we reject it.</p><p>We do not compromise our principles to cater to business;
business today is so used to such treatment that anyone who stands
firm when business says &ldquo;Change!&rdquo; is likely to be called
anti-commercial. For instance, the GPL is designed to prohibit some
anti-social practices, and this applies to business just as to
individuals and schools. If people say the GPL is not
&ldquo;business-friendly&rdquo;, they probably mean it dares to say no to
some of the things their businesses want to do.</p><p>But the GPL extends the same rights to business as it does to
everyone else. And we try to cooperate with business in ways that
are consistent with our principles. For example, I asked publishing
company people for advice when writing the GNU FDL.</p><p>So would you please post a correction to that statement about
us?</p></blockquote></div><p>Since I was making distinctions between two movements, I
decided to share Richard's correspondence with the prime mover of
the other one, Eric S. Raymond, hoping to triangulate a bit on the
full extent of my error. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;did I step in it
here, or (so far as what he quotes) am I right? Or sort of right?&rdquo;
</p><p>ESR wrote back, &ldquo;It's a tough call. No, the official
interpretation of FSF doctrine is not anti-commercial. In that
sense, yes, you stepped in it.&rdquo;</p><p>An on-the-other-hand explanation (OTOH) followed, but it's
not one that RMS found agreeable. Nor was RMS's disagreement with
ESR's OTOH agreeable with ESR. The e-mail volley between the two
gentlemen continues to fill my in-box, so I'll leave that one alone
for now.</p><p>Meanwhile, I invite readers to visit the Free Software
Foundation site at
<a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_self">http://www.fsf.org/</a>. Here
is part of the FSF's explanation of free software:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Free software&rdquo; is a matter of liberty, not
price. To understand the concept, you should think of &ldquo;free
speech&rdquo;, not &ldquo;free beer.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Free software&rdquo; refers to the users' freedom to run, copy,
distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely,
it refers to four kinds of freedom for the users of the
software:</p></blockquote></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The freedom to run the program for any purpose
(freedom 0).</p></li><li><p>The freedom to study how the program works and
adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.</p></li><li><p>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help
your neighbor (freedom 2).</p></li><li><p>The freedom to improve the program, and release
your improvements to the public, so that the whole community
benefits. (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</p></li></ul></div><p>A program is free software if users have all of these
freedoms. Thus, you should be free to redistribute copies, with or
without modifications, gratis or charging a fee, to anyone
anywhere. Being free to do this means (among other things) that you
do not have to ask or pay for permission.
</p><p>So the statement, and I, stand corrected. For my thoughts
about related matters, see this month's &ldquo;Linux for Suits&rdquo; on page
20.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x29a2ce8"></a>TRENDS</h2></div></div><p>by Reginald Charney</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x29a2df0"></a>Languages</h2></div></div><p>Over the last 15 months, the languages with the most growth
have been those directly related to the Internet. Thus, XML, Perl,
HTML, and Java have flourished. However, even these high-flyers
have suffered reversals in the last few months (see
<a href="http://www.accu-usa.org" target="_self">www.accu-usa.org</a>
for more details). It is interesting to note that the highest
flyers are also showing the most deceleration in demand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x29a2f50"></a>Platforms</h2></div></div><p>One of the major changes in the demand deceleration of
platforms is that Windows 2000 has now joined the other platforms
that are experiencing decreased demand. Interestingly enough, while
demand for individual flavors of Windows has decreased, overall
demand for Windows is still growing, albeit slowly. This includes
all dialects of Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x29a3058"></a>What's Hot, What's Not</h2></div></div><p>You must have been on an island not to know that LinuxWorld
was in San Jose in August. It had so many exhibitors that some of
them overflowed the exhibit hall and ended up out in the hallways.
Rumor has it that next year's West Coast LinuxWorld will move to
San Francisco's Moscone Center to handle the anticipated larger
crowds. There also was a lot of big names there: IBM, Dell, Compaq
SGI, HP, Sun, as well as the usual Linux crowd, such as VA Linux
and all the major Linux distributors. The BSD folks also had an
interesting presence.</p><p>If anything can be said about future trends, it has to be
Linux for embedded systems. In contrast, last fall's theme was
Linux in the business world, and this year delivered great growth
in that arena. At this show, most of the software exhibitors were
providers of B2B solutions. Two products caught my eye: the color
PDA, Compaq iPaq, running PocketLinux; and the black and white
Helio. At $500 and $200, respectively, they will give Palm a real
run for its money

office of my old company in 1990 or so. It took the form of a
spreadsheet that we gradually filled with overused buzzwords. To
qualify, they had to work in a phrase the way a blank tile works in
Scrabble: you can use it anywhere, but it has no value.</p><p>We sorted these words into a series of columns: adverbs,
adjectives, adnouns (nouns used as adjectives), nouns, prefixes and
suffixes. After the columns began to overflow, I thought &ldquo;Hmm...BS
seems to be programmable. Let's make something here.&rdquo; So I got
together with Ray Miller of Turtlelips Productions and we (mostly
Ray) crafted a Hypercard stack that put together random buzzphrases
from the table, based on various user-defined combinations of
modifiers, nouns, prefixes and suffixes. BuzzPhraser made a bit of
news and then quickly became one of the most-downloaded files on
both AOL and Compuserve.</p><p>Several years ago, Charles Roth (the prime author of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Caucus</em></span>, the primo conferencing software)
kindly adapted BuzzPhraser to the Web, where it has served ever
since, burping up useful but value-free generica for publicists and

a piece called &ldquo;Thinkful Wishing&rdquo; that envisioned &ldquo;a Linux-based
iMac&rdquo;. Here was his design: &ldquo;Use nothing but end-of-life
components with no fan and no floppy so it can be built dirt cheap.
Boot from the CD-ROM drive. Solder everything onto the boards
including memory, with the possible exception of a communications
slot. We're talking about a black and white box here: simple and
reliable as an old phone. Shoot for a $500+ price point, complete
with all network connections, OS and software, including management
agents. Put the money in memory and display, which ought to be
active matrix, if there's any way.&rdquo; It goes on, but you get the
drift.</p><p>Pretty soon you will be able to get one, pretty much to that
spec, from New Internet Computer, or NIC,
<a href="http://www.thinknic.com" target="_self">http://www.thinknic.com/</a>.
If that name sounds vaguely familiar, perhaps its because yes,
indeed, this is the latest incarnation of Oracle CEO Larry
Ellison's thin client. While the original &ldquo;NC&rdquo;, or Network
Computer, was conceived as a kind of terminal, the NIC is a Linux
workstation. It boots Linux 2.2 off the CD-ROM, along with Netscape
Navigator 4.7 and a catalog of plug-ins. The hardware is a roster
of generics: 266MHz processor, 64MB RAM, 24x CD-ROM, 2 USB ports,
10/100 base T MB Ethernet, keyboard, mouse, speakers. Applications
and storage will reportedly be handled by a remote server (though
it can save to &ldquo;a capable third-party Internet storage system&rdquo;.
It will run Windows applications too, through the Citrix MetaFrame
client. Price: $199.99 (US). Bundled with a 15'' (800 X 600)
monitor, $329.98. The company offers a free ISP, or you can use
your own.</p><p>The CEO of The New Internet Computer Company is Gina Smith,
the high- profile veteran technology columnist, radio and TV
personality. Smith's most recent gig was cohosting CNET News.com.
The scope of the company's ambitions is apparent in two facts that
appear to guarantee a market for the boxes. One is Larry Ellison's
stated commitment to spend $100 million to computerize schools. The
other is Oracle's recent donation of 500 NICs to the Chicago Public
School System, with a promise to match another 500 donated by the
National Association of College and University Business Officers
(NACUBO), which is chaired by General Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret).
In May, Oracle also donated 1200 NICs to the Dallas Independent
School District.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x2d9cbc0"></a>BLOCKING DOUBLECLICK.NET</h2></div></div><p>Theory: If you tell your name server it is in charge of the

article titled &ldquo;Selecting Hardware for a Linux System&rdquo;. Dust off
the copy from your archives, or read it at the
<i  >LJ</i> web site
(<a href="../007/2850.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue7/2850.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28aa580.0x2cafba8"></a>STOP THE PRESSES: HARD REAL TIME</h2></div></div><p>While Linux has quickly emerged as a winning embedded
operating system, the main reason has never been speed. In fact,
some forms of embedded Linux, such as Lineo's popular Embedix, make
Linux a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; RTOS (Real Time Operating System) by combining it
with a second kernel built for real-time work. MontaVista Software,
Inc., however, has been implementing Linux itself as an RTOS since
the company was formed early last year, and has worked to improve
the performance of the Linux kernel to the point where it
qualifies&mdash;all by itself&mdash;as a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; real-time OS. At press time
(September 9) for this issue, MontaVista has delivered what it
claims is a hard real-time Linux kernel, based on the current 2.4
code version. The company claims that this new kernel is fully
preemptable, and provides a 30-fold improvement in performance over
the 2.4 base. Claimed worst case application responsiveness will be
in the hundreds of microseconds. In an interview for
<i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> (this month's
supplement to <i  >LJ</i>), James Ready, Montavista's
president &amp; CEO, said, &ldquo;This isn't just a better embedded
Linux. It's a better Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>As for the new kernel itself, Ready explains that the real
issue is not just responsiveness to interrupts, but preemptability.
Also that making Linux preemptable involved leveraging the same
engineering work that yields Symmetric Multi-Processing
(SMP).</p><p>Hard Hat Linux is MontaVista's embedded Linux brand. The new
version, which is expected to come out of peer review by January,
will offer a real-time scheduler that features deterministic
real-time application selection and dispatching, without altering
standard Linux scheduling. There will also be an optional interrupt
accelerator, based on technology from RTLinux, which is a product
of FSMLabs of Albuquerque, New Mexico. This has a 5x claimed
interrupt responsiveness improvement. The first prototype is for
IA32 platforms and was available immediately at press time from
<a href="ftp://ftp.mvista.com" target="_self">ftp://ftp.mvista.com/</a> A
technical paper explaining MontaVista's real-time developments is
available at
