    The details on proper application location.

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), there are differing ideas
about where to install one's applications and software packages.
Some prefer to install in /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/, yet others
prefer the /opt/ directory. Your preferences may vary depending on
whether you have a UNIX System V, Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD), or GNU/Linux background.
</p><p>The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 1 (FHS), Version 2.1, was
written to eliminate these differences by specifying detailed
guidelines as to where system services, configurations and software
should be located on a UNIX or UNIX-based operating system. In
detail, the FHS explains the content and purpose for each of the
primary directories (see Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4121f1.large.jpg"><img src="4121f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Schema of Primary Directories in FHS
</p></div></div><p>In a nutshell, the base operating system's, or the
distribution's applications are to be installed in /sbin/, /bin/,
and /usr/. The system administrator can build packages from source
and install them into the /usr/local/bin/ directory. However, the
binary-only packages of nonessential applications and add-on
software products should be installed in /opt/&lt;package&gt;/
directories, where &lt;package&gt; is the name that describes a
software suite. The binary executables should be located in their
respective /opt/&lt;package&gt;/bin/ subdirectory. If there are any
accompanying UNIX manual pages, they should be installed in the
/opt/&lt;package&gt;/man/ sub-directories.</p><p>The System V Application Binary Interface [AT&amp;T 1990],
the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard V.2 (iBCS2), the Common
Operating System Environment (COSE), the Linux Standard Base (LSB),
and the UNIX community in general have already established the
/opt/ directory for add-on software.</p><p>The system administrator should create a separate disk
partition for the /opt/ file system, and endusers should add
/opt/&lt;package&gt;/bin/ and /opt/bin/ to their PATH environment
variable. Usually the end-user's shell will find applications in
their respective /opt/&lt;package&gt;/bin/ directories; however,
the system administrator may have created symbolic links or wrapper
scripts in /opt/bin/ for each package.</p><p>Host specific configurations for /opt/ binary executables
should go in /etc/opt/&lt;package&gt;/ directories. These are the
proper locations for configuration files of the /opt/ packages,
because /etc/ is where all host specific system configurations
reside on a UNIX-based operating system.</p><p>Variable files in a package, or files that change during the
normal course of system runtime, should be kept in the
/var/opt/&lt;package&gt;/ directories. The contents of /var/ are
host specific and the directory is usually configured in its own
file system to prevent the accidental filling of the root file
system.</p><p>An exception to these rules is when it is necessary, or makes
sense, for a package to install or create files elsewhere. For
example, if a package were to create a new device, then it would be
created in the /dev/ directory.</p><p>Now that we know the rules of the Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard for add-on software packages, let's try to package and
install a fictional software suite called Whizbang. If we are to
follow the LSB specification, we should use the RPM Package
Manager2 (RPM) and try to package our software for the /opt/
directory. This is shown at lines 18-20 of the whizbang-1.2-3.spec
configuration file (see Listing 1). Line 8 shows how to make it
relocatable so that the system administrator can install it
elsewhere if so desired. However, installing in a nonstandard
directory is not advisable.</p><p><a href="4121l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Let's build Whizbang's RPM package as shown below. Using the
whizbang-1.2-3.spec as the input file, RPM can build and produce a
source package file whizbang-1.2-3.src.rpm and a binary package
file whizbang-1.2-3.i386.rpm.</p><p>The book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maximum RPM</em></span>, by Edward Bailey,
or the RPM web site,
<a href="http://www.rpm.org" target="_self">http://www.rpm.org/</a>, are
excellent resources for learning to create RPM packages. For now,
don't worry about the details, but recognize that there is a
guideline on where to install most everything. To create the
whizbang-1.2-3.i386, do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/whizbang-1.2-3.spec
Processing files: whizbang
Finding provides...
Finding requires...
Prereqs: /bin/sh
Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/whizbang-1.2-3.src.rpm
Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/whizbang-1.2-3.i386.rpm
</pre><p>Using the whizbang-1.2-3.i386.rpm binary package we just
created above, we can now install it onto the system as show below:
</p><p># rpm -i
\/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/whizbang-1.2-3.i386.rpm</p><p>Now that whizbang is installed in /opt/whiz/bin/, try to run
it from the command line. Did your shell find it? Was
/opt/whiz/bin/ in your PATH environment variable? What if we wanted
to make it more convenient for the enduser by creating a symbolic
link to /opt/whiz/bin/whizbang from /opt/bin/whizbang? This could
be done during the post-install phase of the RPM installation, as
shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
%post
P=$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX
mkdir $P/bin &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
ln -fs $P/whiz/bin/whizbang $P/bin/whizbang
mkdir $P/man/man1 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
ln -fs $P/whiz/man/whizbang.1 $P/man/man1/whizbang.1
# EOF
</pre><p>This &ldquo;relocatable&rdquo; post-install code would be added at line
20 in Listing 1; however, the RPM <b  >%postun</b>
uninstall solution to remove the symbolic links is left as an
exercise for the reader.
</p><p>Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to install a software
suite somewhere other than for where it was originally packaged.
Now let's uninstall the whizbang-1.2-3 RPM package, and reinstall
it in an alternate location.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -e whizbang-1.2-3
# rpm -i --prefix /usr/local
# /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/whizbang-1.2-3.i386.rpm
</pre><p>In summary, binary-only packages of nonessential applications
and add-on software products should be installed in the
/opt/&lt;package&gt;/bin/ directory. We've seen the basics on how
to create a relocatable RPM package and how to build it, and we
have demonstrated its flexibility by being able to override the
default /opt/ destination and selecting an alternate location.
Following the FHS standard is the first step in making your
GNU/Linux application more LSB3 compliant.
