    Recent changes in the areas of both software and hardware are
    combining to revolutionize networking.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfd8580.0x10d03f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Revolution is defined as a sudden and
fundamental change, and having seen the effects of one revolution
does not always allow us to foresee those of the next. Revolutions
can cause new waves of innovation and shifts in power and control,
changes that are unnerving and exciting at the same time.
</p><p>One might say that the computer world is experiencing
revolutions in the areas of both hardware and software. What might
happen in the networking arena when they intersect and amplify one
another? Of particular interest is how possible changes will affect
the functionality of the solutions available to endusers, now that
it is suddenly possible to build a new generation of network
appliances that are more powerful and incorporate richer
functionality than traditional router appliances and other
networking equipment. The potential impact of Linux on networking
is even more significant than the impact it has already had on the
server market.</p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s, computer networks were
predominately host-based, with mainframes or midrange systems
constituting most of the processing power. Users were directly
connected to the host using simple, non-intelligent
terminals.</p><p>In the early 1990s, computer network protocols converged into
a few standards and were adopted for use with desktop computers.
Local area networks became a requirement for almost any type of
business. While network services were distributed among many
servers, the network connectivity migrated from host computers to
specialized hardware designed and built to perform internetworking
functions. These specialized network appliances (routers, switches
and access servers) allowed more reliable, cost-effective and
efficient networking. Network connectivity (provided by a router)
and network services (running on the servers) are seen as separate
entities. This is how most people understand networking today, but
cheap hardware and open-source software is beginning to change
this.</p><p>The PC revolution that consolidated in the late 1980s
extended computing power to almost every office desktop. Fueled by
a high level of competition and the establishment of
industry-standard hardware and software, PCs became more affordable
and more powerful. With the Internet, an explosion in the demand
for home computers was triggered. PC manufacturers were able to
leverage the volumes driven, and prices of PC-related hardware
dropped sharply. An article in the May 1995 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
Magazine</em></span> said, &ldquo;As of spring, the touchstone price is
$1,999 (US) for a Pentium/75 multimedia system with 8MB RAM, a
700MB hard disk, and a 15-inch monitor.&rdquo; In January of 1997, when
the first PCs for under $1,000 were offered, the same magazine
wrote, &ldquo;So what does $999 get you? You can buy a 120MHz or 133MHz
system, for less than $1,000.&rdquo; As we start a new decade, consumer
PC prices have dropped further. Today, we can buy desktop computers
with CPUs running over 500MHz, 128MB of RAM and many built-in
peripherals for a few hundred dollars. That is about the same price
you would pay for a typical access router with much less impressive
hardware specifications.</p><p>Because the architecture of servers and desktops are similar,
manufacturers can take advantage of the low cost of components to
build inexpensive server systems. Although cost was one of the
important factors in the substitution of servers for routers, this
is no longer necessarily the case. Standard hardware components are
becoming so inexpensive that it is almost impossible for the
manufacturer of a proprietary hardware device to be competitive.
This trend is reaching a threshold where the addition of a catalyst
could trigger a paradigm shift.</p><p>Linux may be that catalyst. Distributed without restrictions
on use and installation, it is always provided with source code. It
is not necessarily free (zero cost), but anyone can change or
improve it to meet specific requirements. Frequently, those
requirements are shared by others, and the changes or improvements
are fed back to the community.</p><p>According to the latest IDC numbers (August 2000), Linux was
the second most popular server OS in 1999, with 24% of new server
licenses, and is the fastest growing one (the Windows platforms
together have 36%). The favorite for Internet-related applications,
it is growing quickly in the enterprise market for corporate
applications. Due to its roots in the Internet, Linux developed
strong networking support, better than other commercial operating
systems. Because it is open source and receives the contributions
of a huge developer community, Linux is more flexible and evolves
much faster as well. The Linux operating system has features,
security and robustness comparable to a specialized,
internetworking operating system. Put it together with commodity
hardware and the result is a very powerful network platform.</p><p>It's obvious that Linux is changing the server market
landscape: 24% of the market is substantial, regardless of your
preference. While it remains to be seen whether Linux will change
the client/desktop market, its impact on the networking market is
sure.</p><p>In this early stage of the revolution, there is still a need
for technology integrators to make these benefits widely available.
Some technical users are doing the integration themselves. They get
communication boards, integrate them with standard PC hardware, and
build their own Linux-based network boxes. One such example is
Internet Service Providers who, instead of buying a PPP remote
access server to provide dial-up Internet access, use Linux servers
with multiport serial boards connected to modem banks to perform
the same function. Some technology integrators, however, are
already delivering a successful new generation of network appliance
products. For example, the Cobalt Qube is an all-in-one Internet
gateway for small-and medium-size businesses, that can be fitted
with a routing board for WAN connectivity. The whole solution
integrates all the Internet functionality needed, including network
services and connectivity, is very easy to set up and manage, and
costs about the same as the less functional access router it
replaces.</p><p>But this new network device is not simply a more affordable
replacement for the traditional router. It has the added advantages
of expandability and flexibility. As routers were once better
adapted for the network of the past, the new network appliance is
better adapted to the realities of the future.</p><p>Users end up getting new products that are cheaper, better
and easier to use; products that replace the router or access
server, incorporate new networking services, and can be easily
customized to each different application. It is a different kind of
product.</p><p>To fully understand the impact of Linux in this mix, it's
necessary to consider the latest IDC numbers (available at
<a href="http://www.idc.com/itforecaster/itf20000808.stm" target="_self">www.idc.com/itforecaster/itf20000808.stm</a>).
The total client and server OS market was about $17 billion in
1999. Windows generated almost $8 billion in revenues, while Linux
generated less than $100 million. Considering that Linux now has a
substantial share of the market, those numbers are shocking. From
the user standpoint, the value of a solution is the same,
independent of the OS being used; so one would expect revenues to
be proportional to the market share. If Microsoft is making $8
billion on Windows, where are the Linux revenues? Because Linux
combines open architecture and the business models implied in the
open-source model, its &ldquo;revenues&rdquo; translate almost directly into
savings for endusers&mdash;savings that can be used to pay for
integration and services that produce better solutions for each
user.</p><p>This gives some idea of the impact and the shift in control
and power that Linux brings to the table. But our focus is
networking, rather than general purpose OS. According to the last
Data Communications' market forecast, the size of the network
equipment market in 1999 was $70 billion in the U.S. and $120
billion worldwide. All of this money is going to the equipment
manufacturers, holders of proprietary software and hardware
technology, such as Cisco and Nortel.</p><p>So, when open architectures replace proprietary boxes, a lot
of money will change hands. In the networking market, this is
happening in both software and hardware at the same time, the
impact is amplified.</p><p>In the past, proprietary solutions were used because they
were cost-effective compared to server-based solutions. Linux and
standard hardware frees the market, allowing technology integrators
to produce better solutions and be competitive without the need to
drive large volumes (the large volumes are already integral to
open-source and standard hardware). The need for better solutions
drives the change, and open-source and commodity hardware enables
it.</p><p>These changes have important consequences. Today, users
depend on proprietary networking box solutions for features and
functionality. They work well for connectivity but cannot have
services added or be customized in terms of functionality. Users
are driven by economics to separate network connectivity from
network services, and to choose solutions that are many times more
cumbersome and difficult to manage. In the near future, however,
additional functionality will be incorporated into the connectivity
product, and using an open platform will make incorporating new
hardware or software technologies simpler and quicker. Users and
technology integrators will not depend on a sole technology
provider, and control will shift toward the enduser.</p><p>As with any change, at first it is not easy to perceive all
the benefits of a new approach. For networking, all the elements
are in place and changes are coming. New possibilities will be
discovered along the way, and those discoveries will lead to a new,
more powerful approach to networking.</p></div></div>
