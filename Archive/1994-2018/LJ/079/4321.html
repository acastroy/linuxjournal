    A $70 CPU may be all that you need for responsive word processing, photo
    editing, and coding. We take a first look at AMD's Duron, an excellent
    choice for midrange desktop Linux machines.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4321f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16da580.0x17d2710"></a></h2></div></div><p> I have seen the future of desktop Linux
systems, and its name is Duron. A lot of economy-minded Linux
hobbyists became AMD K6 fans back when Intel's offerings were
either pricey Pentium II or wimpy early Celeron. AMD is still
cranking out perfectly respectable K6-2s and -3s that will do very
nicely for most of today's applications. But, software gets bigger
about as fast as users get less patient, so the Duron looks ready
to step into K6's role as the CPU of choice for people who need
responsiveness more than extreme processor power. That is, most
users. A CPU that's too fast is a waste of money, so you're better
off sticking with the economy CPU and spending your money on the
other components.
</p><p>A 600MHz Duron costs somewhere around $60-$70 (US) right now,
and this is cheaper than the Intel Celeron. And clock-for-clock,
Duron beats Celeron. So if you need an &ldquo;Intel Inside&rdquo; sticker for
some reason, buy that separately instead of paying the extra 20
bucks to get the CPU that comes with it. Basically, a Duron is an
AMD Athlon with a couple of minuses and one plus. It has less cache
than the higher-priced Athlon and is not available at the fastest
clock speeds. But, Duron comes in the &ldquo;Socket A&rdquo; form factor,
which just seems sturdier than slot CPUs and is lower to the board,
allowing for smaller cases.</p><p>All this would be very nice for hackers, but not terribly
relevant for the business desktop market, if all we had was last
year's desktop applications. But now, Sun's decision to release
StarOffice under the GNU GPL is a big opportunity for IT
departments looking to save money at the cost of subjecting
Microsoft-Office desktop users to a little pain and suffering in
terms of compatibility and training.</p><p>Most corporations are probably going to play it &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for
now, and throw money at licensing and Windows support staff to
preserve the Microsoft Office status quo. If your company has an
Excel or Access power user among the executives, that's all you can
do, short-term. Just as companies moved out of vibrant cities into
brain-dead suburbs in the 1970s to be close to where the boss
lives, your employer will probably keep Microsoft Office because
that's what the executives know. But, if your big cheeses don't
have any computer skills, they're going to complain equally about
whatever desktop applications you give them. You might as well go
with the no-license-fee, easy-to-support GPL alternative, so they
don't complain about the IT budget too. Be realistic.</p><p>StarOffice and Duron are the enabling technology for a big
boom in Linux desktop systems. But Linux vendors are all building
servers, servers, servers, right? Wrong. ASL, Inc. is a Linux
vendor that has been quietly plugging away since 1995. Even though
most of the other Linux vendors have been racking up server sales
almost exclusively, ASL's President and CEO, Jeff Nguyen, says that
their business has been about 50/50 servers and workstations. The
company recently chose the desktop-friendly Mandrake distribution
as its default install. They're now rolling out a line of
Duron-based desktop systems.</p><p>ASL's Duron box came with a slick, professional out-of-box
experience. The packing slip, complete with a full list of
components, is a good thing to have on file in case you ever need
to reinstall software. The mouse, keyboard, power cord and manuals
were packed nicely on top of a convenient lift-off cardboard
insert, and the machine itself came out and practically set itself
up.</p><p>I can never resist taking a peek inside the case when the
system arrives, so one thumbscrew and two Philips later, I was
looking at the ASL system's guts. The case opens up all the way
around&mdash;pop the thumbscrew and the top slides off, then the sides
slide up. Quality components throughout&mdash;IBM hard drive, Matrox
video card, Ensoniq sound and the same Intel Ethernet card
everybody uses. Motherboard chipset by VIA, a company that built a
good reputation for solid K6 chipsets. If you're like most Linux
users, you never put all the screws back in, so rest assured that
this case stays together with just the thumbscrew.</p><p>But is it fast? Realizing the essential bogusness of
benchmarks as applied to regular desktop use, I ran the GIMP, xaos,
and other CPU-hog programs on the Duron, alongside the same
programs on a much more expensive Athlon system clocked at 800MHz.
And you know what? The speed is indistinguishable. If you want to
crack RSA keys or do heavy rendering, you should probably look at
times posted by people who use your software of choice; for regular
use, just get the Duron. The pre-GPL StarOffice 5.1, in particular,
was nice and responsive, and I would be happy to find this machine
in my cubicle upon starting a new job.</p><p>Although it has one little Duron CPU and one IDE hard drive,
the fans installed on the prototype look adequate for a much hotter
system. It's a big case, about the same size as the one VA Linux
Systems used for dual Xeon workstations. And the fans, front and
back, are loud. Like web server loud. All this to cool one IDE
drive and one little socketed CPU?</p><p>Not for long, Nguyen says. ASL's future Duron machines will
use a Micro ATX version of the same motherboard, so ASL will be
able to make almost identical Duron-based systems in new, smaller
cases with ElanVital's &ldquo;Whisper Technology&rdquo;. ElanVital claims
that they can reduce overall noise from 37 decibels to about 30
decibels with the Whisper system, which consists of a CPU heatsink
and fan, a flexible tube for bringing outside air to the CPU fan,
and a power supply with a thermostatically controlled fan. Good to
see somebody's thinking about the human factors. Any Linux box
people have to work next to should be quiet. I said, any Linux box
people have to work next to should be quiet.</p><p>The noisy fans are going away, but I ran into a couple of
problems with ASL's preinstalled software. First, the kernel wasn't
configured to support DHCP, which is surprising for a desktop
system. However, you can expect DHCP out of the box if you order an
ASL system now; John Kim, a Linux system engineer at ASL, says
they'll be making DHCP work out of the box now that I've brought it
to their attention. An easy fix for them to do, since anybody can
customize Linux.</p><p>Second, I ran into a problem with mangled fonts in StarOffice
when running the Accelerated-X from Xi Graphics that ASL installs
by default. I reloaded the box with the stock Mandrake disks
supplied, and the problem didn't show up under XFree86. Kim says
that ASL is going to try to replicate the problem and check into it
with Xi Graphics, but no word back from them yet.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not really a problem. You can order the
system without the proprietary X server, and if you're going out on
a limb to put free software on the business desktop, why leave
yourself with one piece of proprietary software to track? The
Accelerated-X install requires you to enter a serial number from
the package, which is just not worth the hassle. XFree86 works,
works well and installs automatically if you set things up right.
Even if you're not going to hack or customize it at all,
proprietary software bought and paid for is still inferior to the
free stuff because of the administration burden of keeping track of
licenses.</p><p>Despite the glitches, I can recommend this machine for almost
everyone, and especially for people who have to keep track of an
office full of them. Duron is a good CPU, all the other components
are top-quality, and ASL has experience in the Linux desktop
business. Order one of ASL's Duron boxes with your company's choice
of free software&mdash;they'll do custom loads for you&mdash;but be sure to
ask them to hold the proprietary X server. Otherwise, what's the
point?</p></div></div>
