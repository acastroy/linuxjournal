MontaVista's announcement was not met with universal approval.
Both its most direct competitors, Utah-based Lineo and TimeSys
Corporation had the following responses:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Through our acquisition and integration of
Zentropix, Lineo has been delivering hard real-time Linux for more
than a year now. We have real customers using our hard real-time
solutions today in the areas of flight simulation,
weather-monitoring systems, heart-monitoring systems, industrial
controls and many others.
</p><p>The Lineo real-time solution achieves guaranteed hard
real-time microsecond response times today. This is very different
from the &ldquo;relatively fully preemptable kernel&rdquo;, announced by this
competitor.</p><p>Lineo continues to actively support and promote real-time
technologies. For more information about Lineo's real-time
technologies, please visit
<a href="http://www.lineo.com/products/realtime_linux/index.html" target="_self">www.lineo.com/products/realtime_linux/index.html</a>.</p><p>Lineo also makes hard real time available from our
open-source site
(<a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/projects.html" target="_self">opensource.lineo.com/projects.html</a>).
Users can download a full-version of RTAI (real-time application
interface) and AtomicRTAI from this site.</p><p>At LinuxWorld in San Jose this year, Lineo announced it would
integrate real-time technology into the Embedix SDK, which Lineo
will ship in Q4 of this year.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2190580.0x2288a80"></a>TimeSys Corporation:</h2></div></div><p>A competitor of TimeSys recently announced that they are
&ldquo;the first to deliver hard real-time Linux&rdquo;. TimeSys would like
to point out that this statement is false based on the following
facts:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>TimeSys has delivered to the market in May 2000,
our TimeSys Linux/RT product that incorporates direct extensions to
the Linux kernel that provides a strong platform for building hard
real-time applications. These kernel extensions included support
for guaranteed and deadline-aware CPU reservations with
enforcement, 256 levels of fixed-priority scheduling, support for
priority inheritance, support for periodic tasks, and
high-resolution clocks and timers. These Linux kernel extensions,
called the &ldquo;Resource Kernel (RK)&rdquo; have been downloadable from our
web site
(<a href="http://www.timesys.com/products" target="_self">www.timesys.com/products</a>)
since May 2000. RK extensions are binary-compatible with Linux by
definition and can actually allow Linux applications to be given
real-time and QoS guarantees without accessing or modifying the
application source code.</p></li><li><p>It is well known in the real-time systems community
that fixed-priority scheduling combined with priority inheritance
support and high-resolution timers is sufficient to build hard
real-time systems. In fact, the most popular framework for building
hard real-time systems is called RMA (Rate-Monotonic Analysis),
which requires only these primitives. RMA is the ONLY framework
supported by all major standards in the real-time systems
marketplace, including Real-Time Extensions to POSIX, Real-Time
Java, Real-Time CORBA, Real-Time UML, Ada 83 and Ada95. The
competition does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> support QoS guarantees,
priority inheritance, high-resolution timers or periodic
tasks.</p></li><li><p>In addition, to the direct Linux kernel extensions
described in (1) above, TimeSys Linux/RT 1.0 and 1.1 also includes
the RTAI layer from DIAPM, Italy. The RTAI layer is an independent
higher-priority real-time kernel that runs below Linux. TimeSys
Linux/RT includes both this higher-performance (but
non-Linux-binary-compatible RTAI) layer <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
the Resource Kernel extensions. The two are mutually exclusive, but
both support hard real-time applications.</p></li><li><p>TimeSys Linux/RT capabilities are not hidden or
abstract; they can be explicitly visualized by the use of the
TimeTrace product from TimeSys (please see
www.timesys.com/products). The exact sequence of scheduling events
and system calls occurring on multiple TimeSys Linux/RT targets can
be viewed on a host and verified for strict correctness. In fact,
code segments and system calls that take less than tens of
nanoseconds can be measured <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> adding any
code to an application.</p></li></ol></div></div></div>
