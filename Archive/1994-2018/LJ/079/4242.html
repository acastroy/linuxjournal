top as the next battleground for delivering digital content. These
vendors want to provide a variety of functions, including digital
television, video on demand, program guides, program recording, web
access, e-mail, shopping and games. However, there is no clear
picture of which combination of functions will succeed. Today,
Linux is a minor player in this market but could become more
popular, depending on how the market develops.
</p><p>The key players on the set top are the cable and satellite TV
providers. They are currently replacing their &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; decoder
boxes with interactive set-top boxes (STBs) at a rate of one
million units per month. Most of the initial deployment has been in
Europe, but the United States is beginning to ramp as well. For
example, Adelphia Communications plans to upgrade more than 25% of
its 5.5 million subscribers by the end of 2001. These STBs provide
shopping, e-mail, web access and other interactive services, along
with standard TV programming. TV providers are eager to roll out
these new units to reap an expected bonanza of new service
revenues. Forrester Research estimates that interactive TV services
will generate as much as nine billion dollars (US) in annual
revenue by 2004.</p><p>To deliver these services, STBs rely on a variety of software
customized to display video and web pages on a television set. Some
use middleware, such as Liberate or OpenTV, running on top of a
simple real-time operating system (RTOS). Others use complete STB
operating systems like Microsoft TV (based on Windows CE) and
PowerTV. Service providers can build their own applications on top
of these (APIs) using Java or other popular languages.</p><p>With few exceptions, Linux is being passed over for use in
these applications. Coollogic has developed a set-top box based on
its Coollinux version of Linux, but this product has few adopters.
Liberate and OpenTV could run on top of embedded Linux. However,
many of Linux's key features&mdash;such as robust networking support and
range of APIs&mdash;have already been duplicated in these middleware
products, which have the bonus of being able to work around the
shortcomings of a simpler RTOS. A generic Linux simply can't
compete against the customized platforms available from companies
targeting the rapidly growing STB market.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4242f1.jpg"></div><p>While not a prime choice for STBs, Linux does have a foothold
in devices that might be called set-top companions. These are
devices (such as digital video recorders (DVRs) and Internet access
devices) that connect to the TV but are typically downstream of the
decoder box. The biggest win for Linux has been the Tivo DVR,
widely praised as a groundbreaking device. But Tivo sales remain
well below one million units, mainly because of its high price
($299 US plus $10 per month).</p><p>Video game makers are also fighting for a place on the set
top. Led by Sony PlayStation, more than 20 million video consoles
were sold last year. Few of these devices deliver any functions
other than gaming, but this is rapidly changing, as the Sega
Dreamcast now offers web access and Sony's PlayStation 2 adds DVD
playback as well. Microsoft's X-Box, due next year, will offer both
of these features.</p><p>Single-function devices, such as Tivo and WebTV, will be the
first losers on the set top. Just about everything that connects to
the TV will soon have web access, and DVR functions will be easily
added to any STB with a hard drive, such as the X-Box or Phillips'
AOL-TV unit. By integrating DVR and web functions into other
devices, vendors can deliver these functions at a much lower cost
than in stand-alone products and greatly increase deployment.
Furthermore, adding these features to other products reduces the
number of boxes and wires connected to the TV. User interfaces for
these multifunction devices, however, must be carefully designed to
provide simple access to all functions.</p><p>The fiercest battle will be between interactive decoder boxes
and video consoles. As long as broadcast TV is the primary use of
the television set, the decoder box will be difficult to displace,
since the cable and satellite companies use proprietary digital
formats to deliver their content. On the other hand, video consoles
have highly desired content that is also available only in
proprietary formats.</p><p>In the end, most homes will have an all-in-one decoder box
that supplies a variety of interactive functions. With the possible
exception of DVR, which requires an expensive hard drive, these
functions will have no up-front cost, just a monthly fee. Other
homes may have a simple decoder box and use the video game console
for web access and other advanced functions. Unfortunately, this
scenario leaves little room for Linux. Several major vendors are
well ahead in delivering TV-optimized operating systems and
middleware. Video consoles all use proprietary operating systems
optimized for gaming performance. Linux is great for a company like
Tivo that needs to put together a new product quickly. In the long
run, though, the only chance for Linux to succeed in this market is
if Coollogic, or a similar company, can convince major STB vendors
to adopt the platform.</p></div></div>
