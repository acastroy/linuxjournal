that /dev/hdb4 would be mounted to /usr and /dev/hdb2/ on / and
/dev/hda1 on /boot. My problem is when I restart or halt Linux at
the stage when it unmounts the file systems, I get this error:
/usr: device is busy. And then it freezes there. When I start the
system again, it takes a long time to check it dev/hdb4. I would
like to know how to fix this.  &mdash;Charles Diaz-Alejandro,
oguara@bellsouth.net</p><p>It sounds like there must be a process that is still running
when the system drops runlevels. If that process has any files open
or accesses to that partition, it is possible that
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> will not be successful. What
you might try booting into single-user mode and then looking at how
many processes you have and which ones they are specifically.
Runlevel 1 should have very few processes because they get killed
when you switch runlevels&mdash;it is possible that one of the processes
is not responding or cannot be terminated properly. What you could
try doing while in single-user mode is to remount the /usr
partition read-only with <b  >mount -o remount,ro
/usr</b>. If this fails due to &ldquo;busy&rdquo; errors, then try
killing off some of the higher-numbered processes. You probably
don't want to kill the very low-numbered ones, though. After each
kill, try to remount the /usr read-only until it succeeds. Then you
will know which process is causing the hangup. It may also be due
to the amd process. I have seen amd and nfs cause mishaps like
this. Once you know which process it is, you can disable the
service or at least work towards getting it fixed properly.  &mdash;Andy
Bradford, andyb@calderasystems.com</p><p>The system prefers not to unmount a file system if a file
within it is opened or if a process has its current working
directory within the file system. Most distributions try to remount
the file system read-only if umount fails, in order to avoid the
file system check pass on next boot. Mounting read-only fails only
if a file in the partition is opened for writing. If your mount
command is not to ancient, change the
<span   class="bold"><b>umount</b></span> to <b  >umount
-r</b> (manual says: &ldquo;In case unmounting fails, try to
remount read-only.&rdquo;) I can't tell why your umount fails, but you
can try to find the guilty process by calling &ldquo;fuser&rdquo; in the
shutdown script before the umount command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fuser -m /usr; ps afx; sleep 10
</pre><p>(The &ldquo;ps&rdquo; helps in understanding what the process
IDs are). Refer to man fuser for any details.
&mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it
</p><p>It's probably due to a minor bug in Mandrake. One way to find
out is do add this just before the end of
/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(fuser -vm /usr; ps auxww )| more
read a
</pre><p>(before the &ldquo;# Now halt or reboot&rdquo; section). This
would usually require you to copy /usr/sbin/fuser to /sbin/fuser to
that it's accessible, but since /usr is not being unmounted, it
should still be accessible in /usr. Fuser should show you a list of
processes that still use the /usr mountpoint and you can look up
their number. Then, depending on the output, you can modify the
halt script to kill those processes (although the halt script
should already kill everything) or ask MandrakeSoft why those
processes don't get killed and your partition doesn't get
unmounted.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com

This would enable my computer to sort of power down and sleep when
no activity is detected.  &mdash;Ronnie Bell, ronbell@cais.com
</p><p>If your kernel has APM compiled in (and I believe the default
Red Hat 6.2 kernel does), you can use the standby button on your PC
case if you have one and configure it to put the machine on standby
if you do a short press. From the command line, you can also use
<b  >apm -s</b> or <b  >apm -S</b> for suspend
and standby.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p><p>The kernel automatically halts the CPU when there is no work
to be done, enabling the CPU to enter a low-power mode (the CPU is
reactivated when there's more work to do; this is all transparent
to you). You can also configure APM (Advanced Power Management)
support in your kernel, assuming you have a laptop with an
APM-compatible BIOS. For even more power savings, you can tell the
X server to use DPMS (the Display Power Management System) to turn
off your monitor after a long enough period of keyboard/mouse
inactivity. I do that with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xset +dpms
xset dpms 600 1800 3600
</pre><p>This puts the monitor in standby mode after 10
minutes (600 seconds), goes to suspend mode after 30 minutes (1,800
seconds) and turns it completely off after 60 minutes (3,600
seconds). Each of these levels increases the power savings. Adjust
the numbers to suit your working style, but be aware that your
video card and monitor must support DPMS in order for this to
work&mdash;otherwise, nothing special will happen. As an alternative to
the xset command, you can enable DPMS support in your XF86Config
file; search for &ldquo;power_saver&rdquo; in the XF86Config man page for
more information. Finally, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>hdparm</b></span> command to spin
down your hard disk. I don't personally recommend this, if only
because spinning the drive down and back up reportedly causes as
much wear and tear as six hours of use, but you can do it if you
want to (read <span   class="bold"><b>man hdparm</b></span> for
details). I'm willing to make some sacrifices for the good of the
planet, but sacrificing my Linux disk is simply too much to ask.
:-)&mdash;Scott Maxwell, maxwell@ScottMaxwell.orgi
</p><p>You should use the apmd package, which is available from Red
Hat's distribution. Of course, the &ldquo;apmd&rdquo; d&lt;\#230&gt;mon
should be started at boot time (try &ldquo;setup&rdquo; or &ldquo;linuxconf&rdquo; to
add it to the system services).  &mdash;Pierre Ficheux,
pficheux@com1.fr</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5c580.0x1b549d0"></a>Who Am I?</h2></div></div><p>I'm running Red Hat 6.1 on a Dell machine and I have DSL
Internet access through Telocity. Until I got the Telocity service,
my computer always thought of itself solely as
&ldquo;localhost.localdomain&rdquo;. (For example, my bash prompt would read
&ldquo;[jenny@localhost tmp]$ &rdquo;). This seemed lame, but caused no
problems. After Telocity came into my life, it mostly thought of
itself as dsl-216-227-xxx-xxx.telocity.com. I'm not completely
sure, but I think my prompt changed accordingly. After a recent
reboot, though, we're back to &ldquo;localhost.localdomain&rdquo; and certain
pieces of software with license managers that use the server's name
are not working anymore. The licenses had been set up during the
DSL phase. I've gotten them working again, but I'm afraid that one
day my machine will go back to being dsl-blah-blah-blah and I'll
have to fix it all again. Where does my computer's true identity
reside? At what point in the boot process or on a running system
does that get decided? How can I eradicate one of these identities
entirely? What is the role of /etc/hosts? Could I have it both ways
and have both entries in there? If so, would the IP address for
dsl-blah-blah-blah need to be the loopback address 127.0.0.1, or my
IP address from Telocity? For the record, the output from
<b  >uname -n</b> (today, at least) is
localhost.localdomain. And here's my /etc/hosts file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@localhost splus]#  cat /etc/hosts 172.16.87.2
windoze.localdomain  windoze 127.0.0.1  localhost.localdomain
localhost
</pre><p>Thanks very much!
&mdash;Jennifer Bryan, jennybryan@telocity.com
</p><p>Red Hat keeps the machine name in three places: /etc/HOSTNAME
(which is largely ignored; it's for compatibility with Slackware),
/etc/sysconfig/network (HOSTNAME and DOMAINNAME) or /etc/hosts. You
can change your machine's host name from the shell prompt with
<span   class="bold"><b>hostname</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moremagic:~# hostname foo
moremagic:~# hostname
foo
moremagic:~# bash
foo:~# exit
exit
moremagic:~# hostname moremagic.merlins.org
moremagic:~# hostname
moremagic.merlins.org
</pre><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com
</p><p>Actually, your machine is &ldquo;localhost.localdomain&rdquo; when the
Ethernet interface is down (ie the system is not connected to the
network). Once the eth0 interface is up, the name of your system is
&ldquo;dsl-216-227-xxx-xxx.telocity.com&rdquo;. According to the description
of the problem, I think you don't use a fixed IP address, so your
IP (and so your name) will change every time you reboot the system.
If your license is configured for a static IP address, it would
work only when your dynamic address matches the license address. I
don't know a lot about your license manager, but maybe it's
possible to use the Linux &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; net driver configured for the
address defined in the license manager. Here is an example of
dummy0 configuration on my system (assuming 192.168.3.3 is the
static address used by license manager):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig dummy0 192.168.3.3 up
route route add 192.168.3.3 dummy0
</pre><p>If connected to the Net, your system will reply
both to the dynamic DSL IP address and the static dummy IP address.
If not connected, the system will reply only to the dummy IP
address used by the license manager. Another solution is to get a
static DSL IP address from your ISP. It's more expensive, but will
work every time. I don't think /etc/hosts could help you in case of
dynamic IP. The file is useful for adding hosts name+address or
name aliases you don't want to add to your DNS.

in an X session and I use my mouse (I've tried the Microsoft
Intellimouse, and the Logitech First Mouse), sometimes my system
locks up and I can't exit the session even forcefully. The mice
I've been trying function normally otherwise, and I've tried using
them in both PS/2 and serial ports with both the generic and
specific drivers. This lock happens only when I use the mouse, but
it doesn't happen immediately&mdash;it can happen after five minutes of
use or 45 minutes of use. There doesn't seem to be a pattern. The
techs at Red Hat didn't have a clue, and I'm getting pretty
desperate. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  &mdash;Mike,
shirleymg@netscape.net
</p><p>Considering that a PS/2 mouse uses interrupt 12, which no
self-respecting motherboard should assign to anything else, unless
you have an ISA card that uses that interrupt, it's probably not a
mouse conflict. It's not necessarily the mouse; it could simply be
your X server or your graphics card. Try to see if upgrading X
works, and if that still doesn't help, try swapping the graphics
card with another type.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p><p>If this happens only with PS/2 mice, then it may be due to a
problem in some versions of the kernel driver. A PS/2 mouse is
managed by the keyboard controller, so if you lose one, you lose
both. Try upgrading to the latest version of the kernel release you
are using. Since you report the problem with any kind of mouse, I
don't think it's related to mouse activity. Please try to resort to
the &ldquo;Magic SysRq&rdquo; feature to print out some system information
when the lock happens. Using the magic SysRq feature, you should
also be able to kill X; if not, you should reproduce the problem in
text mode. If no information can be extracted, then the system is
locked hard, and it looks more like a hardware problem than a
software one. Maybe the processor shuts down for overheating or
something similar.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5c580.0x1b55268"></a>Text-Based Installation</h2></div></div><p>How can I do an install with Corel 1.1 in
text-based mode? Or, rephrasing the question:
I'm trying to install Corel 1.1 on a laptop. Since Corel is
GUI-based from the get-go, I get an unreadable screen during the
install. I was able to do a Red Hat 6.2 install on the laptop,
since I was able to put it into text mode during the install. Any
words of wisdom on Linux laptop installs?  &mdash;Ed, Ed.Werzyn@POBox.com
</p><p>I think Corel requires a Vesa 2.0-compliant video card to
install and doesn't offer a text mode install. If you really want
to install Corel nonetheless, you can install it onto another
machine, boot from an NFS+network+pcmcia boot floppy or CD
(<a href="http://www.toms.net/rb" target="_self">http://www.toms.net/rb/</a>
for instance) and do an NFS copy of your installed distribution
over to your laptop.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5c580.0x1b55420"></a>Invisible Typing</h2></div></div><p>Hi, I seem to be having a slight problem. When I ctrl-alt
F1-F6 from X or quit out of the wm, I am greeted with a blank
console; everything I type on that console is blindly written. This
happens anytime I go into X and back out to a console. I can issue
a reset and I will get the console back, but soon as I go back to X
and then back out, it's again blacked out (or no fonts/text
showing). I have edited /etc/inittab for the alt + uparrow to issue
a reset, but this is a workaround and very annoying. Does anyone
know what is actually screwed up and how to fix? I recently
compiled X 4.01 and it was fine up until the time I rebooted a day
or so later for a kernel compile. I have seen this problem before,
so it's not an X 4.01-specific problem. It's an &ldquo;I screwed
something up&rdquo; problem, I am guessing. I am not running
SVGAtextmode, nor are the fonts on console scrambled, they are just
blacked out.
&mdash;Steve Udell, hettar@home.com</p><p>If you aren't running your text mode in 80x25, try doing
that. Some video drivers don't restore nondefault text modes very
