server message blocks (SMB) networking services in a mixed
operating system network. This 13-chapter book offers the reader
foundational information, advanced topics and explores
administrative issues. The book is designed and written to present
the steps involved with building Samba servers. The book's examples
focus on running SMB services on top of NetBIOS over a TCP/IP
network. The book is well illustrated with screen captures,
figures, tables, file listings and sample file segments.</p><p>The target audience leans toward NT administrators involved
in UNIX integration. Nevertheless, UNIX administrators involved in
NT integration will also find a wealth of information on providing
SMB networking services to Windows clients.</p><p>There is a movement to publish a Common Internet File System
(CIFS) file access protocol for Internet use. CIFS is based on the
SMB protocol. Several sections of the book discuss using SMB and
CIFS server resources lumping them together in several discussions.
Visit the
<a href="http://www.cifs.com" target="_self">http://www.cifs.com/</a> web
site for specific details and the status of CIFS.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>SAMBA Black Book</em></span> opens with a quick tour
of networking, obtaining and installing Samba, and provides the
steps for setting up Samba file and print servers. Next, Microsoft
client use of Samba servers, configuring Win95/98/NT to use a
SMB/CIFS server resource, and steps for using SMB/CIFS from a UNIX
machine are presented. Following this are steps for using SMB/CIFS
in complex network environments and using Samba as a domain
controller.</p><p>Advanced topics include automating Samba, using it as a FAX
server, and performance tuning. Solutions to complex mixed
operating system networking challenges are offered as well.
Examples of the solutions offered include browsing through multiple
subnets, running databases on Samba servers, operations through an
IP filtering firewall, user login authentication, Microsoft Windows
roaming profile support, and backup and recovery of a mixed
operating system network.</p><p>Next, steps for securing Samba servers and Samba
troubleshooting are provided. Chapter 13 contains a collection of
tidbits such as Samba bug fixes, some early words about Windows
2000 and Samba, and the forthcoming Samba Win NT printer
support.</p><p>Information is well laid out and labeled. Major topic titles
are written as statements of knowledge or a task to be performed.
&ldquo;Using NetBIOS&rdquo;, &ldquo;Understanding SMB&rdquo; and &ldquo;Setting Up a Share&rdquo;
are some example titles. Each chapter opens with the major topic
titles repackaged as a list of Immediate Solution statements.
&ldquo;Setting Access Rights on Shares for Different User Groups&rdquo; is
one Immediate Solution statement from Chapter 4. The book presents
only the information needed to understand the idea or accomplish
the task. I feel this approach keeps the book very focused&mdash;the
words lean and the content meaningful.</p><p>Readers knowledgeable about a subject area can easily skip
over chapters or sections of chapters without hindering their
implementation of Samba. I found myself reading the first few
chapters sequentially, then began skipping around, reading only
that which supported the task I was performing or information I was
seeking. For example, I wanted to know what programs made up Samba.
I found a detailed discussion of the Samba executables. Each Samba
executable was first divided into one of three groups: servers,
clients or utility. Next, the author presented the purpose of each
program. Then he moved on to discuss the characteristics and use of
the program's options. This explanation gave me a good feel for the
location of Samba functionality.</p><p>Appendix A of this book lists sources for Samba and Samba
documentation. Internal <span   class="bold"><b>smb.conf</b></span>
constructs, parameters and legal parameter values are discussed.
Appendix B is a delightful touch. It contains a list of additional
resources, organized according to chapter and subject area.</p><p>Many acronyms are used in this book. The index did not help
me when I wanted to find the first use of an acronym and its
associated explanation. One example is CIFS. I remember reading
about CIFS in several places, yet I could not find the acronym nor
the phrase &ldquo;Common Internet File System&rdquo; listed in the
index.</p><p>The accompanying CD-ROM reportedly contains a complete copy
of the Samba FTP site and copies of configuration scripts contained
in the book. Various programs mentioned in the book are also
included on the CD-ROM. Binaries for some Linux distributions,
commercial flavors of UNIX and related operating systems.</p><p>According to the book, binaries supporting 19 operating
systems were included. I selected Novell, MVS, IRIX, AIX and
Solaris operating systems from the list. I could not find a binary,
or reference to a specific binary, for Novell, MVS or IRIX on the
CD-ROM. Granted, this may not be a problem for most people, I
mention it only to point out that there are some differences
between what the book says is on the CD-ROM and what I could find
on it. The latest release (at the time of pressing the CD-ROM) of
the RFCs is included.</p><p>Technology often travels faster than book publishing. As the
author suggests, visit the Samba web site
(<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">http://www.samba.org/</a>)
to obtain the latest release of Samba and its documentation. From
what I read on the Samba 2.07 announcement page, the solutions
offered in <span   class="emphasis"><em>SAMBA Black Book</em></span> should still
apply.</p></div></div>
