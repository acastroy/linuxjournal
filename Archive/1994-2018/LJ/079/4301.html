    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262d580.0x27254a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> It's strange how often
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> essential tools of trade are readily
dismissed as gadgets (mandatory usage being &ldquo;mere gadgets&rdquo;). The
doohickeys that <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> cherish are, of course,
totally pathetic in my eyes, revealing you as a &ldquo;sharper image&rdquo;
slave to self-defeating, fashionable mechanisms. Price and pride of
ownership (closely related, nay, tightly bound) have clearly
blinded you to the rational basics that guide my purchases.
</p><p>The origin of &ldquo;gadget&rdquo; is, as the more honest
lexicographers say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>orig. uncertain</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>etym. obscure</em></span>. Some guess at the French
<span   class="emphasis"><em>g&acirc;chette</em></span>, but this was originally the
safety lock-catch on a door or pistol, a reference to security and
hard to reconcile with our modern &ldquo;mere&rdquo; gadgetry. Later,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>g&acirc;chette</em></span> moved to become the pistol's
&ldquo;trigger&rdquo; (as in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Elle a la g&acirc;chette
facile</em></span>, &ldquo;She's trigger happy&rdquo;) which is perhaps more
cognate with current gadget usage (see Note). She clicks to
conquer, opening car/garage/home doors and TV channels, and,
replacing old-fashioned scholarship, clicks to access the webbed
windows of opportunity. Losing your clicker (I risk a
gender-switch) is gadget-impotence, akin to Milton's blindness.
Fear not: there's a meta-gadget you can click that will locate
(beep-beep) your misplaced clicker. Lord knows what deeper levels
of technology exist for recovering lost meta-gadgets. And now that
mice, keyboards, modems and monitors (more) are becoming
footprint-loose, wireless &ldquo;remotes&rdquo;, there's a growing chance of
mislocation.</p><p>My own amateur spin is that &ldquo;gadget&rdquo; has morphologically
diminutive implications (easy for me to say) that have added to its
derogatory usages. I would back-form the term &ldquo;gadge&rdquo; to describe
my own solidly justified possessions, regardless of price,
conversation-party-piece, physical size and weight.</p><p>We are, patient readers, converging to a topic relevant to
Linux, the OS we all love. I refer to the test known as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>productivity</em></span>, an apparently simple econometric
criterion that should (fat chance) dictate all our choices. The TV
gadget heyday ads of the 1950s and '60s showed a trim USA
super-efficient Mum clicking breakfast for hubby and her 2.7
adorable kids, then clicking the washing up. The general mantra
&ldquo;labor saving&rdquo; (since applied to all forms of automation) left
open the questions, &ldquo;Saved at what cost?&rdquo; and &ldquo;time saved to do
what else?&rdquo; There's the ancient Time &amp; Motion quip: Expert:
&ldquo;If you follow our plan, you could paint twice as many fences.&rdquo;
Tom, the painter: &ldquo;But there aren't twice as many fences to
paint.&rdquo;</p><p>The equation has been obscured by the more subjective notion
of &ldquo;personal productivity&rdquo;, yet even at the corporative level,
after endlessly refined techniques and &ldquo;studies at well-known West
Coast Universities&rdquo;, it remains dubious whether we can ever
well-order our choices of computer languages, operating systems,
development methodologies or guiding columnists.</p><p>Except to assert that my gadges are the best.</p><p><a href="4301s1.html" target="_self">Note</a></p></div></div>
