and yet many others continue to appear. Some are as small as DLX
which sits on a single floppy; others are as big as Red Hat 6.2,
packed in five CDs. Things seem to become more complex and harder
to manage as systems grow. How is a Linux system put together from
pieces of free code? How can we assemble and customize our own
system for a particular purpose? It seems to be a hard task.
</p><p>However, from the view of the base system, in principle, all
distributions are assembled in a similar way. The difference is
that big ones are armed with more packages and more fancy stuff
targeted at more general audiences, and small ones have fewer
goodies and are aimed at relatively narrow and specific user
groups.</p><p>Fully featured Linux distributions are usually unnecessarily
big for specialized situations. For example, embedded applications
need a slim base for their particular situations, and there are
already small Linux distributions available for these purposes.
However, because there are so many factors to consider, no one can
claim that their distribution is comprehensive and satisfies all
customers.</p><p>Usually an application needs a customized base system to work
efficiently. You can pay for a solution from many Linux service
providers, or you can do it yourself. Sometimes knowing how to
build the base system on your own is more beneficial. With such
skills and knowledge, engineers can easily control and improve the
system's behavior for the needs of their customers. DIY
(Do-It-Yourself) is not just fun, but strategically important in
some cases, and more people are recognizing the value Linux offers.
By doing so, you acquire the ability to customize not only the
Linux kernel but also all other components of your system to
achieve the optimizations best suited for your requirements.</p><p>This article tries to tell readers that building your own
base Linux is not a daunting task. It tells our experiences and
gives a brief introduction to building and customizing a Linux
system. It is a base system: small, clean and ready to go. We try
to make the complex simple, without losing generality and
effectiveness. We show how to make the building steps as easy as
1-2-3, and how to customize this system to be minimal, accommodated
in one floppy. After all, it should be good enough to be used as a
start point for a base system to run any typical applications. This
is possible because we build the system directly from unchanged
sources. This allows us to always use the latest stable versions
and make all required kernel services available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19fa818"></a>Linux System</h2></div></div><p>A system is simply defined as a combination of inherently
connected parts. A Linux system (only considering software in this
article) is a combination of a Linux kernel and other components
which make the kernel useful. All software components except the
kernel need to be resident in a root file system (there may be a
few other file systems, but they must be mounted under the root
tree to become visible). So, technically, we can simply consider a
Linux system as a combination of a kernel and a root file system.
All Linux distributions are arranged in this way. For example, a
fully installed Linux system is a kernel plus a big root file
system. A Linux installation disk and a rescue system are used to
install a full system and to repair problem systems, respectively.
They are also organized in the same way; that is, consisting of a
kernel and an initial root file system, but the initial root file
system is small and only holds a few basic components necessary to
do limited jobs (see Figure 1). The Linux kernel has been coded to
take special measures to locate the root file system, either from a
normal file system or from a compressed image of an initial root
file system.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4287f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Linux System
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19faad8"></a>The Approach</h2></div></div><p>Given an application, we want to run it above the kernel
using shared libraries on a box. Assume the application doesn't
require any rare features which Linux doesn't provide at the
moment. We want a base system that can run this application and
provide some basic control and management as well. A typical case
of the base system is shown in Figure 2. Note that this figure is
not complete because a utility may be statically linked, which
doesn't require a shared library and a utility may be an a.out
style, which doesn't use a dynamic loader.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4287f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Base System
</p></div></div><p>If the application is self-sufficient, that is, statically
linked with everything required at runtime, it can run right over
the kernel without any support from shared libraries. The base
system in this case may mean only the Linux kernel itself. However,
almost all systems need support from one or more utilities to
manage things like file operations and system monitoring, using
commands like mount and ps. We consider a base system to be a
combination of the kernel, the dynamic loader, a set of libraries
and a set of utilities.</p><p>Like many other systems, our goal is to show how to create
the system on a floppy with both the kernel and a compressed image
of an initial root file system, as shown in Figure 3. This
compressed initial root file system will be uncompressed by the
kernel and put into a ramdisk, that is, a space of RAM set aside to
hold a small Linux file system. Creating such a base system is
often straight-forward, but rather tedious for most people. We
simplify the procedure. The idea is to design a well-organized
hierarchy of makefiles which will extract sources, compile, and
setup the contents of the initial ramdisk, then prepare and pack
the whole system.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4287f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Arrangement of System Components
</p></div></div><p>Customization of the above base system depends on the
requirements of the application that will run on the box. Choose a
configuration for the kernel, a dynamic loader, a set of libraries
that are necessary for the application and utilities, and a set of
basic utilities which are required to control and manage the
system. Then, compile all these things in a consistent environment.
After that, package the results and make it bootable. If something
is missing, you are free to add it to the list, and make it
again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19fb058"></a>Our Modest Goal</h2></div></div><p>A curious reader might ask why we do this and what it is good
for. Like many others, we want to run some complex software on a
box, something that can be generalized as a multitasking
application on a typical PC-like machine without hard disk or
monitor. We need an OS kernel and some elements as the base
experimental platform. This platform should be robust, maintainable
and customizable. Writing a good OS kernel for this purpose is too
scaring for many. Thanks to Linux and the Open Source community, we
now have an excellent option.</p><p>Basic materials are ready and available for free. Now it is
time to pick up pieces we need, assemble our own engine and control
it. Then, it is time to enjoy.</p><p>Before we start, we need to know the answer to some key
questions: How to compile the kernel? How to compile a shared
library? How to create an initial root file system? How to put the
kernel image and compressed file system onto a floppy or EPROM? How
to run an application using shared libraries? How to debug? There
are many questions like these. The answers are already documented,
not, as far as we know, in a single place, but scattered over a
wide range of documents. We don't want to write a comprehensive
document for these questions but, rather, tell our story and major
part of our answers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19fb210"></a>Steps</h2></div></div><p>Once the plan has been made for customization, detailed steps
can be put into action. General steps in our work are described in
the following.</p><p>1. Setup the development environment
Install a full Linux distribution such as Red Hat 6.0 as the
development platform. Make sure it's gcc-supported. To make things
easy, assume the target machine on which we run our customized
system and the host machine, that is, the development machine, are
using the same type of CPUs, in our case Intel x86. Otherwise, we
have to prepare a cross-compiler.
2. Customize the kernel
Get the latest stable kernel source (version 2.2.13 at this
article's writing). How to configure and compile the kernel are
well documented in the source files. We don't want to repeat the
details here. But we need to choose support for initial ramdisk,
loadable modules and other necessary options. If we use the serial
console port, choose serial console support. If we have a piece of
hardware we want to set up, like an Ethernet card, we can select
them as modules. Then we can install and use these modules in our
base system.
3. Prepare the standard libraries
Get the latest stable standard library glibc (versions 2.2.1). This
includes almost everything we want: the dynamic loader, the
standard C library and math lib, etc. Although we don't need all
that glibc provides, it's better to build them all together, then
choose what we want. The documents in the glibc source tree tell in
detail how to compile it. Because we use it for our target machine,
we have to compile it using the kernel header files consistent with
Step 2. This can be specified using
<b  >--with-headers</b> during configuration. Also, we
have to install all library header files so that the compilation of
other components for the target machine can use them.
4. Let the compiler know how to cross-compile
After installing kernel and glibc header files, we need to prepare
the compiler, gcc, to use them. Glibc2-HOWTO describes this in more
detail. Briefly, we need to tell gcc where to find specifications
using the option <b  >-b</b>. In our case, because the
target and the host machine are basically the same, we need to use
only the host machine specs. This can be found by using the command
<b  >gcc -v</b>. For example, on my box, the reply is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
(egcs-1.1.2 release)
</pre>


Compile other components of the system by adding the option
<b  >-b</b> as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -b i386-redhat-linux
</pre>


5. Select and prepare utilities and other libraries
To compile a utility program such as mount or libraries other than
those in glibc, such as termcap, consistently, we have to tell the
compiler where to find all the header (include) files and the
libraries. First, we tell the compiler not to search header files
in default paths by specifying <b  >--nostdinc</b>.
Second, tell the compiler we are compiling sources for the target
machine by using option <b  >-b $MACHINE</b>, as
described in Step 2. Third, state exactly where to find the kernel
header files and the standard library header files by specifying
option <b  >-I</b>. Fourth, tell the loader what
libraries to use and where to find them by using
<b  >-L</b> and <b  >-l</b> options.
6. Build applications
Like compiling for utilities and libraries, we need to
cross-compile our applications in order to use them on the base
system. There are no particular considerations needed from the
system view, except to make sure everything on which the
application is dependent is installed already.
7. Package things together
Once all the components are ready, we need to arrange them in such
a way that the system be booted, and any everything can be
correctly located. This issue is discussed in more detail in the
following section.
8. Move on
Use the base system as a start point for whatever you want to do.
More features can be added, as needed, over the base system. A
separate section is devoted to this issue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19fb738"></a>Creating a Base System</h2></div></div><p>As far as we know, it is hard to find a document that tell us
in detail how to put images, executables, binaries and scripts
together; in other words, to package things together, to assemble a
system. Different systems may take different approaches to
packaging, although components can be created in the same way. The
easiest and most popular way is packaging on floppies. The general
steps of packaging a bootable system on a single floppy, that is a
boot/root floppy, can be summarized in the following few
steps:</p><p>1. Create individual items needed for the system, such as the
kernel image, libraries, executables, scripts and configuration
etc.2. Create the directory structure of the initial root file
system for the base system.3. Move things to the root file system
and create items like device nodes.4. Create the compressed root
file system.5. Tell the kernel where to find the initial root file
system image by setting some flags in the kernel image.6. Write the
kernel and the compressed root image to a floppy and make it
bootable.
To show more details, we wrote a set of makefiles. They are
actually instructions to implement the above steps and to create a
small base system from freely available packages. We run a simple
application called a netperf sever which tests TCP/IP stack
performance and is also freely available from the Web. We provide
these instructions in Resources. It may not be simple to run, but
curious readers can dig into the lines and find how to build a base
system from scratch.
</p><p>An application can be started in different ways depending on
how the base system is configured. In most of cases, a Linux kernel
is configured to run a startup script or a binary executable,
called <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>linuxrc</b></span>, in the initial root file
system after the kernel is up. This init program usually does
things like remount the root file system to allow read/write
permissions, mount other file systems like proc, and initialize
other parts of the system, such as starting a shell interface or
running the application immediately. The SysVInit program is very
popular in most Linux distributions for this purpose.</p><p>For our base system, we don't need a complex init sequence to
demonstrate. So, we simply write a shell script like the following.
Anyone is free to change and add more commands to it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -n -o remount,rw /
mount /proc /proc -t proc
echo  MyCompanyName, Version X.Y. Built Z, August 2000
exec /bin/sh
</pre><p>As an exercise, it might look better if you have the above
echo line in your application, and start the application at the end
of the script instead of running the standard shell. An example in
C++:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cout &lt;&lt; COMPANY &lt;&lt; VERSION_NO &lt;&lt; BUILD_NO &lt;&lt;
__DATE__ &lt;&lt; __TIME__;
</pre>


In our case, the system prompts after it is up.
<pre     class="programlisting">
pipe-elinux&gt; MyCompanyName, Version X.Y,
Build Z, August 2000
pipe-elinux&gt;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19fbb58"></a>Making It More Attractive</h2></div></div><p>After the base system is up, you might think it is not much
use without any interesting applications. But it is a base from
which you could start your big project. One by one, you can
gradually add things into this base system, making it more and more
attractive. The following examples might be worth
considering:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a init program : SysVInit is a good choice, but it
seems too big for simple applications</p></li><li><p>a security facility: add login support</p></li><li><p>an editor : vi or emacs</p></li><li><p>more networking services: telnet or ftp
d&aelig;mons</p></li><li><p>a GUI : X is a choice</p></li><li><p>non-volatile storage: flash memory and hard disk
support.</p></li><li><p>add more loadable modules</p></li><li><p>use rpm to manage packages</p></li></ul></div><p>We don't really need to recompile every package we choose,
because we can easily find a binary already compiled for a
processor. Like our system, the host and the target machines are
the same type, so, we can just use most of the binaries found on
the host machine. For example, for the utility
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>, we just copy the binary into
our base system; and then it runs. Things are not always that
simple, however. Because most often we have to sort out the
dependencies for an executable, that is, the shared libraries it
needs and configuration files it reads, usually we don't know until
we run it. However, some tools can help us with this.
<span   class="bold"><b>ldd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>strace</b></span> can tell us these
dependencies. For example, once I tried successfully to run Emacs
on the base system by simply copying the executable (emacs-nox), a
few shared libs and configuration files to the base system. This
usually helps us a lot during the development and saves a lot of
time.
</p><p>You might not be satisfied with booting from floppies.
Instead, you can implement booting from EPROM or others. To do
this, you have to redesign your packaging approach, but the
components are mostly unchanged. What's specific here is the kernel
image loader. Booting can be implemented like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>boot from EPROM</p></li><li><p>boot from Networks</p></li><li><p>boot from devices like flash, hard disk partition,
CD-ROM and ZIP disks; that is, any devices other than
floppies</p></li><li><p>boot from other OS</p></li></ul></div><p>If you like and want to spend more time, you can make your
system as fancy as many other successful systems already in the
field.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1902580.0x19f2ff0"></a>Problem Solving</h2></div></div><p>One of the advantages of using Linux is that there are many
documents and tools to help you customize your system and solve
problems. The code is no secret. Everything inside and outside is
open. Besides, there are many other useful sources in print and on
the Web. There is no other system which can compare to Linux in
this respect, not even Free BSD, let alone any proprietary
operating systems.</p><p>Typically, for a problem, we might work out a few different
solutions. We always want to pick the best one, of course, but it
is not easy to know which is the best until we have tried each of
them. To solve a problem, in many cases, we can find answers by
consulting Linux HOWTOS and docs, or asking Linux guys in our
organization. As an alternative, you can post a message on a Linux
newsgroup and hope someone on there can give you a quick reply. If
you want to pay, there are many Linux-related companies providing
technical services as well. (If the problem is stubborn, as the
last straw, kick your buggy box a few times, as I did sometimes.
You must be careful&mdash;don't break it and then reboot. That should
work; otherwise repeat the problem-solving sequence from the
beginning again.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> is an excellent
debugging support for applications on the base system. If we don't
want or are unable to run a full gdb on the target system, that is,
the base system, we can run small remote gdb facilities as either a
gdb stub or a gdb server on the target. Besides, things like the
syslogd d&aelig;mon can also help debugging on the target
system.</p><p>There are many good problem-solving strategies. Whatever
approaches we use, the goal is to find the proper solution. It is
usually safe to follow a successful example. For example, we learn
something by checking things inside a Red Hat rescue system. We can
do this simply with the following few commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat rescue.img | gzip -d &gt; rescue_root.img
mkdir rescue_root
mount -o loop rescue_root.img rescue_root
</pre><p>Here rescue.img is the compressed rescue floppy image found
in the Red Hat distribution's images directory. Then we can check
its contents by:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ls rescue_root
</pre>


It displays:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bin dev etc lib lost+found mnt proc sbin tmp usr
</pre>


You get all the detail in the floppy.

Linux base system. For a particular situation, it could be rather
complex, especially when modifications at the code level are
required, such as to support specialized hardware. But, we have
shown that it is a manageable task. Our purpose is to make things
simple in order to encourage people to take the challenge. By
creating our own customized base system with a moderate effort, we
get a power engine which can drive us into the bright
future.</p><p><a href="4287s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
