    Can't afford Don Marti's &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; Linux
    box? Well, read on&mdash;Jasonw
    outlines options for the economically challenged.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Don Marti's a big spender. In his
article, &ldquo;Building the Ultimate Linux Workstation&rdquo;, he waxes
technical, recommending various components needed to build the
mother of all Linux workstations (see page 80). He has little
regard for expense, and his Linux box is top-of-the-line all the
way. That's all well and good, but the thing would cost some
unthrifty soul at least $3,000 (US). If you have that kind of cash,
Don can tell you where to spend it, so read his article (before
reading this), as he provides good general advice on selecting
components for your system.
</p><p>Of course, reading Don's article will no doubt set your mouth
to watering, but the hefty price tag may send you back my way. I'm
bitter, but resigned to the fact that I simply cannot afford Don's
screamer of a system. However, I needed a computer for home, and
didn't have much money. To be exact, I needed to stay under $1,000.
So I began searching for components and discovered that putting
together a zippy, dependable Linux box can be done for as little as
$800. I checked out workstations from VA Linux and Dell, amongst
others, but found that by putting it together myself, I could save
$500 for a comparable system. More importantly, I'm building the
system from scratch. I chose the components and I'm responsible for
putting them together. It wasn't terribly difficult and the
knowledge gained is immeasurable. How much do I love my new
computer? Very, very much!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149f5b0"></a>Options for Penny-Pinchers</h2></div></div><p>Sacrifices are in order when building an economical system.
To save money, you shop for what you need, not for what you want.
This means looking for discontinued parts or &ldquo;last year's
models&rdquo;. It also means locking up your ego. Sure, I would like to
have two CPUs and multiple SCSI hard drives, but I don't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> that stuff.</p><p>I'm not into gaming and I don't do much fooling around with
the GIMP. I write, I surf, I e-mail. This means one CPU, one hard
drive, decent video and sound cards, a solid motherboard, a
refurbished monitor and as much memory as can be afforded. Yes,
refurbished. Not ideal, but you can spend as little as $150 for a
sufficient monitor. However, we are talking about your eyes, so
take care to spend as much as you can&mdash;make the monitor a top
priority. I was lucky enough to have a spare monitor, but I did
some searching and good deals abound.</p><p>Research is very important. Take some time to find the best
deals. At one point, I had found a processor for $69 and nearly
bought it. The next day I stumbled upon the same processor for $56!
If you really need to save money, exhaust your resources. But you
should be able to stick with companies you recognize and
trust.</p><p>I spent a week scouring the Internet, and bought my
components from various sites. My components arrived within a week
of placing the order. Sure, I paid for shipping, but I still saved
money, since Seattle computer stores just weren't price
competitive. The Internet connects you directly to hundreds of
stores with sales, discontinued items and so on. Working with a low
budget put me at the mercy of Internet shopping, but I have no
complaints thus far. If shopping via the Internet scares you, then
research the companies you buy from&mdash;it will only take a few
minutes. The system I put together consists of the following
components:</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149f818"></a>Motherboard</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Type:</b></span> Super Socket 7 503+
Baby AT<span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $80 US
(<a href="http://www.aberdeeninc.com" target="_self">http://www.aberdeeninc.com/</a>)
<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span> VIA Apollo MVP3 chip set,
2-DIMM and 4-SIMM sockets, 3x PCI, 3x ISA, 1x AGP, ECC and PC100
memory support, and up to four IDE drives</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> has used Socket 7
motherboards for years. They are workhorses and the one I chose is
both affordable and powerful. This is a step or two down from the
top, but the board is solid. Its main strength is memory. There are
four (72-Pin) SIMM sockets and two (168-Pin) DIMM sockets, which
allows for as much as 512MB of system memory. Cache memory is 1MB.
This all means my initiation into the world of Quake may not be too
far off. It also means that this board should allow me to run most
of the applications I want. The board will accommodate up to four
IDE drives, and works with AMD K6 processors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149fb30"></a>Processor</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Type:</b></span> K6-2 3-D
500MHz<span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $56 US
(<a href="http://computersupersale.com" target="_self">http://computersupersale.com/</a>)
<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span> 321-Pin (CPGA)/ZIF Socket 7
(P54C/P54CS/P55C MMX), RISC86, 64-bit (pipelined) 100MHz, On-Chip
Split 64KB (L1) Cache</p><p>Don Marti says, &ldquo;A CPU that's too fast is a waste of money,
so you're better off sticking with the economy CPU and spending
your money on the other components.&rdquo; So, I bought an AMD K6-2
processor. It works well with the Socket 7 motherboard and was a
mere $56! I do not believe the chip is discontinued, but it doesn't
receive the same marketing push as, say, the Duron. Less marketing,
in this case, equals lower cost. It doesn't mean lower
quality.</p><p>I wasn't too worried about having a superfast processor,
since my needs don't require it, but this processor should run
Linux fast enough and, more importantly, the low price allowed me
to spend more on memory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x149fe48"></a>Memory</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Amount:</b></span>

(<a href="http://solutions4sure.com" target="_self">http://solutions4sure.com/</a>)
<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span> 100MHz DIMM, 1 module,
100MHz memory bandwidth</p><p>Get as much memory as you can afford. I planned my spending
in order to afford at least 128MB, which allows me to run multiple
applications simultaneously. For $140 I have as much memory as I
should need, for now. However, my motherboard supports up to 512MB,
so once my raise goes through, I should be able to invest in more,
more, more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14a0108"></a>Hard Drive</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Type:</b></span>

<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span> Ultra ATA/66 interface,
15.3GB, 512KB cache buffer, 5,400RPM</p><p>Ideally, I would like to have two drives, but this is not the
&ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; Linux box, so one will have to do. Money constraints
pushed me toward IDE, instead of SCSI, but at least I was able to
get 15.3GB for a low price. Another drive can always be added later
(buy a case with space), which would allow me to run Linux on one
and store personal files on the other. As Don Marti recommends,
&ldquo;Don't rely on a spare hard drive in the same machine as the only
backup for the main drive...backup over the Net to another system,
or use tape.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14a03c8"></a>Sound Card</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Type:</b></span> Ensoniq
AudioPCI<span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $24.99 US
(<a href="http://www.computersupersale.com" target="_self">http://www.computersupersale.com/</a>)
<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span> 2MB or 4MB memory, 16-bit
stereo digital audio, MT-32 compatible instrument set</p><p>This was a no-brainer, since Creative is one of the better
sound card manufacturers. Don Marti rates the Soundblaster Live! as
the card for his ultimate box and I have jumped a few notches down
with the AudioPCI card, which he recommends. This is a good, basic
card that serves up CD-quality sounds and getting it to work with
Linux is easy. It's perfect for a low-end Linux box and should meet
most user needs. Again, the price is right&mdash;just $25! Don't forget
to write &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; on your warranty card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14a0688"></a>Video Card</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Type:</b></span> ATI 3-D Rage
IIC<span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $45 US
(<a href="http://www.aberdeeninc.com" target="_self">http://www.aberdeeninc.com/</a>)
<span   class="bold"><b>Specs:</b></span>8MB, 66MHz AGP Bus,
528MB/sec. peak, MPEG/DVD acceleration</p><p>The video card is the only part of the machine that I am not
completely satisfied with. I went with the ATI card to save money,
but it just isn't the right one, I fear. The verdict is still out,
but scrolling up and down, as well as cursor movement is slow. I
don't know how much patience I will have for that, so I will be
changing the card as soon as I can afford one. I most certainly am
not against all ATI cards, so their high-end cards may be worth a
look.</p><p>Dan Wilder, <span   class="emphasis"><em><i>LJ</i>'s</em></span> technical manager,
recommends offerings from 3dfx or Matrox. These cards will be more
than double the price of my ATI card, but well worth it for gamers.
As with a monitor, the video card will have a direct relationship
with your eyes, so I recommend spending a bit more on graphics. A
lot more if you're playing games. The card I chose will work fine
for my needs, but a 16MB card would be better for gaming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14a0a50"></a>Case and Fans</h2></div></div><p>The only mistake I made while ordering components was
committed on the case. First, I should have bought one locally,
which would have saved shipping costs. Duh! Second, I bought an ATX
case, which won't work with my AT motherboard and added to my
shipping costs. Doh! I returned the ATX case and cruised over to a
local shop for a mid-tower AT case. It set me back $30 and included
a 300W power supply. It has a removable side panel, room for extra
drives, and space for multiple fans. It isn't see through or blue,
nor does it resemble a penguin. Functionality before style is the
motto of the thrifty spender.</p><p>Don Marti (page 80) has useful recommendations for the number
of fans your system will need. I currently have three (one for the
CPU, one mounted toward the front and one nearer the back) and am
considering adding another. They are cheap and keeping your system
cool is too important. All in all, I spent $50 on three
fans.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14a0bb0"></a>The Rest</h2></div></div><p>I <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need a modem, but haven't bought
one yet, which means I am without the Internet at home. This
explains why I'm at work on a Sunday, as well. I intend to buy a US
Robotics v.90 external for about $75. Using an external modem has
the benefit of reducing the temperature within your case and
provides easy access for you. Plus, most external modems are
compatible with Linux and all external modems with a serial port
are compatible with any device with an RS-232-compatible serial
port (i.e., the Palm PDA).</p><p>I already had a keyboard and mouse, but these are cheap and
would hardly add much expense. The same can be said for a floppy
drive, which I found new for $10. You will probably want a CD-ROM,
especially for installing your distribution. I had an older one,
which worked fine for installation purposes. However, if you can
get by without a CD-ROM, you might be better off saving up for an
external CD burner, which is my plan.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a7580.0x14975f8"></a>The Results</h2></div></div><p>While Don was out spending thousands of dollars on his
system, I spent hours and hours searching for the lowest-priced
components, in order to keep my system low-priced. All told, this
isn't a screamer of a system, but at least it yells. For under
$1,000, I managed to put together a respectable system that I
intend to show off to friends and family. It's mine&mdash;I built
it!</p><p><a href="4327s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
