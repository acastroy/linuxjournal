    Cutting this scanning kitty up to to discover the hideout

RatShack (&ldquo;You've got questions. We've got blank stares.&rdquo;)
yesterday along with a few other odds and ends. [see
<a href="http://www.getcat.com" target="_self">http://www.getcat.com/</a>
to get your own free CueCat&mdash;Editor.] If the store actually carried
the stuff in their commercial sales catalog, I'd be a happy
camper&mdash;I don't need an animated Elvis Presley phone, I need a
local source of microcontrollers and specialized ICs. But I
digress.
</p><p>One of the things that has a few people worried is that the
clerk at Radio Shack takes down your name and address in their
system before giving you a CueCat. However, there doesn't appear to
be a way of tying a particular CueCat to a person at the time of
purchase (although Digital Convergence can most likely trace a
CueCat back to a particular Radio Shack). Although each CueCat has
a unique serial identifier, each CueCat package has the exact same
bar code on the front (which is what the clerk scans in). My goal
was to find where that serial identifier lurks inside the
CueCat....</p><p>I opened up the package and immediately began to open up the
scanner (see Figures 1 and 2).</p><p>

Figure 2. Scan of the Top Side of PCB
</p></div></div><p>I carefully removed the shield and forcefully removed the
serial EEPROM (see Figure 3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4325f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Image of the Board with the Shield
Removed</p></div></div>
</p><p>The component that caught my eye was the small 8-pin device
(U1) on the top side of the board (see Figure 4). For a detailed
list of the semiconductor devices see the sidebar.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4325f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. A Small 8-Pin Device</p></div></div>
</p><p><a href="4325s1.html" target="_self">Semiconductor Devices of the
CueCat</a></p><p>The scan doesn't really show the markings at all, but it's an
ATC 93LC46, which is a 1kbit serial EEPROM. Unfortunately, ATC
doesn't have datasheets for the device available on their page. Not
to worry, as other manufacturers, such as Microchip and Holtek,
have 93LC46s available. The datasheet for Holtek's HT93LC46 is
located here, and it's a closer match than the Microchip unit, as
it implements an ORG pin to control how the memory is accessed (in
the above picture, the ORG pin is tied to VSS&mdash;this would make the
unit addressable by 128 8-bit words if it was actually a Holtek
93LC46, but the ATC unit appears to be set up the opposite
way&mdash;more on this later).</p><p>The first thing I tried was removing the 93LC46 from the
board. However, I'm really not equipped to desolder SMT devices, so
this was rather futile. So, I simply soldered some wirewrap wire
onto the pins to see what's going on. I hooked my trusty scope up
to them and found that the data is read out of the 93LC46 only on
power up of the CueCat (about 100ms after power up, to be
exact).</p><p>After this, I tried hooking up the 93LC46 to a PIC
microcontroller (with a little bit of code that I whipped up) to
see what lurks inside the serial EEPROM. Unfortunately, I managed
to wipe the contents of the EEPROM (looks like it reads back all
locations as 0xFF now). Oh well, at least I don't have that pesky
serial number in there anymore.</p><p>Unfortunately, hooking up a microcontroller to erase the
EEPROM is a little out of range for your average privacy-concerned
individual. I'm guessing it should be possible to disable the
serial number by cutting the CLK line to the EEPROM, which should
be easy for anyone with a keen eye and a sharp X-acto knife.</p><p>I'll have to wait until I get another CueCat before
investigating what's inside the EEPROM. In the meantime, I've been
looking to find exactly what EEPROM data areas are being scanned.
With my trusty Tek TDS 210, I took a closer look at the CS (chip
select), SK (clock) and DI (data input) lines. For those
interested, the 93LC46 is an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
device&mdash;it uses a synchronous serial line to transfer data (your
computer's serial port is asynchronous and doesn't use a separate
clock line). The CS line is used to tell that particular chip that
it's being talked to, otherwise it will ignore data being sent to
it.</p><p>The 93LC46 is sent a total of nine commands (they are all
read commands, but more on this later). The CS line goes high a
total of nine times (the first CS &lt;\#145&gt;pulse' is extremely
long, as the CS line goes high as soon as the CueCat is powered
on), and I used this as a baseline to see what was happening on the
SK clock line (since my scope has only two channels, I can't look
at every pin at once). I noted that there were 27 clock pulses
during each CS &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; and I could see a gap between clock pulses
where the CS line went high-low-high. I hooked up the SK and DI
lines to the scope and took a look at exactly what bits were being
sent: CS &ldquo;Pulse&rdquo; Data Clocked In</p><p>1 0110000001111111...2 0110000010111111...3
0110000011111111...4 0110000100111111...5 0110000101111111...6
0110000110111111...7 0110000111111111...8 0110001000111111...9
0110001001111111...</p><p>Okay, now the first thing to note is that the leading
<b  >0</b> is basically garbage, as the first
<b  >1</b> is really a start bit (and not yet the
beginning of a command). Also, the trailing 1s aren't really bits
sent to the EEPROM&mdash;these are clock pulses provided for the EEPROM
to write out its data on the DO line. So what we really have is a
command like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
10000110
</pre><p>followed by a high DI line. The first two bits are the
command, followed by the address. In the 93LC46,
<span   class="bold"><b>10</b></span> is the read command. But what's
this? We only have six bits to define the address and a lot more
than eight clock pulses after the command is sent&mdash;the EEPROM must
be organized as 64 16-bit words!
</p><p>So, the microcontroller reads in a total of 9 16-bit words
from addresses 0x01 through 0x09 (I have no idea why they didn't
start at 0x00). Note in this sample scan,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.C3nZC3nZC3nYCNr2C3fWCNnY.fHmc.C3DZCxPWCNzWDNnX.&lt;\n&gt;
     000000001175023101      UPA     040293153502
</pre><p>that the serial ID field is 18 characters long (or 9 16-bit
words). I wonder if they're hiding anything nifty in the other 55
words? And why did they use a serial EEPROM? I would think that
something like Dallas Semiconductor's silicon serial number would
be a smaller, cheaper, totally non-volatile alternative, but maybe
this gives DC better control over assigning IDs (perhaps there's a
&ldquo;special&rdquo; bar code that can be scanned in to rewrite the
EEPROM?). I'm glad they used a 93LC46, though&mdash;you can desolder
them and use them for other stuff...
</p><p>Anyhow, I'm itching to try disabling the serial ID by cutting
one of the traces to the 93LC46&mdash;I don't have a virgin CueCat to
try it on, but if anyone wants to give it a shot, cutting any of
the traces shown by the yellow cut marks, indicated in Figure 5,
should disable the serial number (or give floating voltages to
really whack out what the microcontroller is reading back&mdash;you may
even be able to get some &lt;\#145&gt;random' serial numbers
generated this way).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4325f6.large.jpg"><img src="4325f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Cuts From Top to Bottom Disable the DI
(data in), SK (clock) and CS</p></div></div>
</p><p>Or, you can slice the line, indicated in Figure 6, by the
microcontroller to sever the DO (data out) line (I'd be inclined to
try this one myself&mdash;the floating voltages could be fun here).
Remember&mdash;you should need to cut only one line to disable the
serial ID&mdash;take your pick.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4325f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Cut Here to Disable the DO (data out) line.
</p></div></div><p>If anyone decides to give it a try, let me know how it turns
out&mdash;your CueCat should still be able to read bar codes without any
problem.</p><p>I picked up another CueCat last night&mdash;this one is the
68-1965-A model (supposedly more common) rather than the 68-1965
which is shown here. I'll be tearing apart this one later and
posting the innards. How can you tell the difference? The A model
has four small screws holding it together, the older one has two
larger screws. The A has a small grommet for the wire on the cat's
butt and a large black square for the scanning window, rather than
the smaller rectangular opening on the 68-1965.</p><p>Oh, and if any lawyers representing Digital Convergence want
to send me threatening letters, cease &amp; desist orders, or more
hardware to disassemble (I'd appreciate a USB CueCat when they
become available). Note in advance, however, that any legal mumbo
jumbo will be met with a polite &ldquo;s&mdash;w you!&rdquo;</p><p><a href="4325s2.html" target="_self">Reprint Permissions</a></p></div></div>
