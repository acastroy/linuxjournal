</p><p>I can't stand listening to Ralph Nader. His rap resonates with a
lot of people, but for me the guy is strumming on a brick.</p><p>See, I love business. And I love markets, which are the
social environments of business. They're fascinating to me,
especially right now, when the sociology of business is changing so
rapidly. Many of those changes start with the sociology of
software&mdash;most notably the Free Software and Open Source movements.
That makes business <span   class="emphasis"><em>really interesting</em></span> right
now.</p><p>But Ralph hates business. Ever since he made consumer
advocate a job title and became its permanent exemplar, he's been
out to protect consumers from producers, no matter what.</p><p>Pick any big business and Ralph has a beef with its
producers. Take air travel, for example. Since airline
deregulation, a system built primarily to serve the world's upper
business castes has been transformed into a bus system for
everybody. As affordable transportation, a coach seat from New York
to Chicago on American Airlines today is about the same price as it
was on Greyhound in 1960.</p><p>Considering what it's asked to do&mdash;transport millions of
people millions of miles at great altitudes at explosive speeds in
fuel-engorged metal contraptions between airports built to handle
far less traffic, every day, and do it while killing people at a
rate far lower than automobiles&mdash;the airline industry delivers a
service that routinizes the miraculous on a grand scale.</p><p>But, it has problems. There are lost bags, late arrivals,
suspicious cancellations, bad food, stale air...all the stuff
comedians have been joking about for generations. So comes the
question: What do we do about all those problems?</p><p>Well, it depends on whether &ldquo;we&rdquo; are <span   class="emphasis"><em>the
government</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>the market</em></span>. Ralph
thinks <span   class="emphasis"><em>We the People</em></span> means <span   class="emphasis"><em>We the
Government</em></span>. So do most of your basic Democrats. Your
basic Republicans think <span   class="emphasis"><em>We the People</em></span> means
<span   class="emphasis"><em>We the Market</em></span>. So Democrats like solving
problems with Big Government while Republicans like solving
problems with big market.</p><p>The problem is that neither side has ever seen a big market
in which there has been much balance of power between supply and
demand. Supply has pretty much controlled demand ever since
Industry won the Industrial Revolution. That's why those of us who
listened in history class remember a little something about James
Watt's steam engine, James Hargreaves' spinning jenny and Eli
Whitney's cotton gin, while we remember zip about the angry losers
who broke into Hargreaves' home in 1768 and smashed twenty of his
jennies. On the road of history, those guys were pavement.</p><p>We do remember something about the Luddites.</p><p>Here's some context from the French historian Elie Halevy,
who wrote the six-volume <span   class="emphasis"><em>History of the English People in
the Nineteenth Century</em></span> . In the first volume, originally
published in 1913, he writes: &ldquo;The equilibrium of society was
overthrown to the detriment of the country districts, and to the
advantage of the towns which were rapidly increasingly both in
number and in size.&rdquo;</p><p>Production, Halevy notes, changed from a local and
artisan-based system to a centralized factory-based system,
requiring workers and their families to abandon their rural homes
and move to the cities and towns surrounding the new factories.
This was no abstraction. It was the relocation and enslavement of a
defeated people: &ldquo;In these vast urban masses and in the
manufacturing districts surrounding them the established social
fabric was completely shattered.&rdquo;</p><p>Luddites were craftspeople who refused to admit defeat. &ldquo;A
movement of insurrection on a large scale was organized in 1811,&rdquo;
Halevy writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For two years the Luddites, as these revolted
workmen were called, smashed (knitting) frames by the hundred,
pillaged houses, and assaulted or killed obnoxious persons. The
agitation spread to the neighboring districts and caused panic
throughout the length and breadth of England. Cobbett extolled the
Radicalism of Nottingham; Byron sang the praises of the
Luddites.</p></blockquote></div><p>So does <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Working Class Encyclopedia</em></span>
(<a href="http://hammer.prohosting.com/~penz/encycl" target="_self">http://hammer.prohosting.com/~penz/encycl/</a>),
but with a different spin:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The original Luddites operated in the Midland
counties of England in 1811 and 1812. They did not roam the
country, destroying any machine they found, as popular belief has
it. They did their research and attacked only the looms belonging
to scab Weavers who undercut the price of Handweavers. Often looms
belonging to different Weavers were set up in the same room within
a factory. The looms of fair-priced Weavers were left
untouched.</p></blockquote></div>

Note the capitalization of the noun &ldquo;Weaver&rdquo;. This is a handy
reminder to check your surname for the fossil remnant of an
ancestor's role in a real marketplace. If it's Weaver, Weber,
Tanner, Smith, Baker, Shoemaker, Shumacher, Merchant, Marchand,
Hunter, Farmer or Fermier, your signature is a living reminder of
the time when markets were profoundly social, when one's &ldquo;living&rdquo;
and one's name were the same thing. Supply and Demand, Production
and Consumption were all no farther apart than Vendor and
Customer&mdash;the distance of one handshake.
</p><p>The hearts of their cultures were the markets where they met
and did business.</p><p>The beginning of the Industrial Revolution was the end of
craft. While a few people continued to produce goods on their own,
their economic significance was trivial. What mattered were the
mines, factories, mills and transport systems that made and moved
goods from production to consumption.</p><p>Markets were reconceived as commercial habitats where schools
of fishlike creatures called consumers were organized by appetite
and fed products pumped down distribution pipes that terminated in
retail outlets. The culture this produced was often called
&ldquo;consumerism&rdquo;, but the better label is producerism: an economic
and cultural system where producers were in charge.</p><p>This is the vast economic machine that Ralph Nader&mdash;the
ultimate Luddite&mdash;is out to break. So he attacks it everywhere
producers make life hard for consumers, such as coach class in
airplanes. &ldquo;One would think that buying an airline ticket for a
seat on the plane would include knees along with toes and torsos,&rdquo;
Ralph writes. &ldquo;But since airline deregulation over twenty years
ago, passengers who do not fork up the dollars for a first class
seat are treated more as cattle than as customers when it comes to
space.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, not entirely. Airlines also had to find ways to handle
demand for more passengers on a finite number of routes. Still,
some airlines are starting to treat coach passengers as full-bodied
bipeds again. American Airlines, Ralph observes, &ldquo;will give them
three to five extra inches of space in about a year.&rdquo; Then, he
adds, &ldquo;Hooray for small favors.&rdquo;</p><p>He sees no reason why big government shouldn't correct the
airline industry. &ldquo;Within the next 60 days the Aviation Consumers
Action Project (ACAP) will file a petition with the FAA and the
Department of Transportation to set minimum leg standards, unless
the industry follows American Airline's lead in increasing coach
class leg room to tolerable levels&rdquo;, Ralph writes. He also calls
for a Six-Footer's Club, &ldquo;to advance normal comforts for tall
people&rdquo;. If you want to find out more, he provides a PO box in
Washington, D.C., plus a phone number, but not a web site (although
I found the quoted piece at
<a href="http://www.nader.org" target="_self">http://www.nader.org/</a>).</p><p>As a working (and consuming) class hero, Ralph is right up
there with Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg and C&eacute;sar Chavez. No
other individual has had more influence on the biggest industry in
the United States&mdash;automobiles&mdash;than Ralph Nader. The man has
single-mouthedly saved thousands of lives. We owe him.</p><p>So why can't I listen to him?</p><p>Because he has already won and doesn't know it. The
Industrial Age is over, and the Information Age is well underway.
Workers are walking away from rusty old industrial machines that
are dying for a single transcendent reason: they mistook people for
parts. Now those people are going off to ply their crafts as
competent human components of better, smaller machines&mdash;or large
machines with better, smaller, more craftlike, i.e.,
autonomous&mdash;parts. These are machines they run, not machines that
run them.</p><p>Consumers&mdash;those poor victims Ralph still fights for&mdash;are
starting to discover what they really are, which is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>customers</em></span>. If they don't like what they find
in the market, it has never been easier for them to go make those
things themselves, or to draw the attention of smart producers to
the presence of demand. In this new age, the threshold of
enterprise is so low it verges on zero. The thresholds of creation
and innovation aren't much higher, which is why product and service
choices spread wide everywhere supply hears demand. And what choice
does supply have but to listen? If they don't, somebody with better
ears will get the business.</p><p>The world is working like a real marketplace again, for a
single reason: it's wired that way.</p><p>Who wired it? Try the Open Source development community,
including the Free Software movement from which it grew. If you
want to see a model of a craft-driven world in which every
&ldquo;worker&rdquo; is a free, autonomous and effective agent, this is it.
Show me a large technology producer (e.g., IBM, Dell and HP) that
now proclaims itself as Linux-committed, and I'll show you a
company in compliance with its software engineers as well as its
customers' software engineers. All of those engineers like Linux
and open-source software because it's easy to craft. It still might
not be easy to use, but the software craftspeople are taking care
of that. This was made especially clear by the GNOME, Helix Code
and Eazel developers at LinuxWorld Expo in August 2000. Finally, we
had an answer to the innovation vs. implementation question. These
geeks can do both, thank you.</p><p>These are the same geeks Ralph addressed at The Bazaar last
December, (his speech is at
<a href="http://www.cptech.org/ms/harm.html" target="_self">www.cptech.org/ms/harm.html</a>).
In that speech, he expressed extreme agreement with the
government's case&mdash;and judgment&mdash;against Microsoft. I just checked
on Altavista to see how many pages link to that speech. Try six. A
total of 1,748 pages point to the Consumer Project on Technology
(<a href="http://www.cptech.org" target="_self">http://www.cptech.org/</a>)
domain, where the speech resides. Ralph's own home page
(<a href="http://www.ralphnader.org" target="_self">http://www.ralphnader.org/</a>)
makes an even sadder case, attracting a whopping total of five
inbound links.</p><p>Perspective: Slashdot's number is 28,303. Which goes to show
there aren't a whole lot of consumers left in the Open Source
development world.</p><p>Or anywhere, which is Ralph's real problem. Ralph has a
vested interest in the consumer, just like a Marxist has a vested
interest in the worker. His heart is in the right place, but that
place is being vacated by people who are starting to notice they
have real power that power doesn't come from social and political
movements, or from those movements' leaders. It comes from
themselves.</p><p>Consumers and workers are rhetorical relics. The Net is
uniting both, and they're throwing off their chains. Industrial
communism and capitalism are both terminal. They can't survive in a
networked marketplace, where &ldquo;We the People&rdquo; means exactly what
it says.</p><p>We have real challenges in this marketplace, not the least of
which is understanding how it's going to work, now that &ldquo;the
People&rdquo; are working both sides of the supply-and-demand handshake.
What are the new social contracts? What laws do we really need, and
why are we keeping the ones we don't? How can we truly help those
who can't help themselves? What are our agreements about privacy
and anonymity, and how do we organize them? How do we build the
needed infrastructure around our new Commons, and how do we keep
those stuck with dead industrial market models from wasting our
time?</p><p>We can find a democratic answer in the networked market's
most honest voting mechanism. It's called the hyperlink. If what
you say doesn't attract many, maybe there's no market for
it.</p></div></div>
