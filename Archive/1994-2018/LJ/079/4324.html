    I'd like to introduce a <i  >Linux Journal</i> supplemental
    issue which will hit the streets October 10, 2000: <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a8580.0x21a04a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> In 1968, when I got my first job in
computing, we didn't call that room full of computers with a disk
drive the size of a Volkswagen an embedded system. But it was. I
worked for Collins Radio and what we were working on was a
message-switching system. Today, however, that same computing power
could easily fit in a 1U rackmount box or be implemented on a
Netwinder or Cobalt Qube.
</p><p>The point is that calling a system embedded doesn't have
anything to do with its size, but whether it performs some
dedicated task. Besides the changes in size over the years, there
have been cost changes. While my microwave doesn't have an embedded
processor in it, most, do as do most traffic light controllers and
virtually every printer in the world.</p><p>Doing an inventory of what is around me at home, here is my
list of things that I know have embedded processors: Palm
organizer, cell phone, FAX/answering machine, scanner, digital
camera, video camera, dish TV receiver, VCR, stereo, laser printer,
DSL modem car. At work I can add microwave, label maker, phone
system, voice-mail system and conference phone.</p><p>This doesn't count other items that most likely have them as
well: disk drives, tape drives, monitors, TV and clock radio. This
is a big change from 1968. With $50 (US) products out there in the
embedded market, there is a lot more to consider than just making a
product that works.</p><p>We want to help you take the next step. Hardware costs have
fallen dramatically, making it possible to put computers into
relatively inexpensive products. Efficient code can reduce RAM and
ROM requirements. But there are additional costs besides hardware.
The OS for your product, development time, development tools and
licensing all cost money. Shipping a product with bugs can cost you
money and reputation.</p><p>With that I'd like to introduce a <i  >Linux Journal</i> supplemental issue which will hit the streets
October 10, 2000: <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>. In
this special issue you can look forward to conversations
about:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>industry news&mdash;emphasizing open-source software
solutions</p></li><li><p>reviews of products to reduce development time and
improve testing</p></li><li><p>case studies that will save you time</p></li><li><p>design solutions that show you why embedded Linux
is the cost-effective answer</p></li><li><p>hardware vs. software considerations</p></li></ul></div><p>Current <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscribers who
live within North America will receive this special supplement at
no additional charge. This issue will also be heavily distributed
at upcoming trade shows, other industry events, and to targeted
mailing lists.
</p><p>We're certain you'll enjoy this upcoming <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> supplement. We look forward to your feedback!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Phil Hughes Publisher</p></div></div>
