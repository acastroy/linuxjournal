famous image processing program realized that Motif (a toolkit for
X Windows) wasn't as good as they had thought, but there wasn't
much else out there to choose from. So they wrote their own widget
set, GTK+. Then, later on, came GNOME, which wrapped around GTK+
and provided higher-level widgets (like the calendar and the
calculator). It can all get rather confusing at times, which is
where <span   class="emphasis"><em>The GNOME/GTK+ Programming Bible</em></span> comes
in.</p><p>The book is a solid introduction and reference to both GTK+
and GNOME programming. It is liberally scattered with code (roughly
a third of the book consists of examples and sample code, all of
which is on the accompanying CD-ROM), and includes line-by-line
explanations for most of the samples.</p><p>Chapter One introduces GTK+ and GNOME, explaining how GTK+ is
object-oriented although it's written in C, as well as sketching
out what signals and callbacks are. The second chapter is a
tutorial on a very basic GTK+ program, a window with a button. It
also covers how to create a basic GNOME window. In Chapter Three,
you learn how GTK+ and GNOME pop-ups and dialogs work. The GTK+
method of packing widgets is, admittedly, different from most other
windowing systems, and the fourth chapter covers just that by
explaining packing boxes and tables. Virtually infinite flexibility
comes with the ability to pack widgets inside of other widgets
(i.e., tables within boxes within notebooks within scrolled windows
within tables, ad infinitum). Chapter Five explains how this works,
showing you the way to endless hours of packing pleasure. The glues
that hold GTK+ together&mdash;events, signals and callbacks&mdash;are
described in Chapter Six.One main point of GUIs is the ability to
have graphical representations on the screen, &lt;\#225&gt; la
icons and other pictures. Chapter Seven explains the XBM and XPM
formats and how to use them in your programs. Finally, the eighth
chapter covers menus and toolbars&mdash;stock menus, disabling/enabling
menu items, and radio/toggle buttons in toolbars and menus.</p><p>Part II contains step-by-step instructions on a variety of
GTK+/GNOME subjects. Chapter 9 covers the GnomeCanvas widget,
Chapter Ten describes the GTKDrawingArea widget, and Chapter 11
explains how to use graphic contexts. Input devices are important
in any type of interface, so Chapter 12 is devoted entirely to the
mouse and the keyboard. Chapter 13 provides some basic instruction
on using fonts, and Chapter 14 shares some tricks for working with
widgets. GNOME applets are covered in the fifteenth chapter, and
drag-and-drop is described in the sixteenth. MDI (Multiple Document
Interface, used for having more than one document open at a time)
is explained in Chapter 17. From time to time, you'll realize the
widget you need doesn't exist. There may be something similar, but
it doesn't quite do what you want. Chapter 18 shows you how to
create your own widget, either from scratch or based on another
one. Chapter 19 explores configuration (manipulating the config
files found in your ~/.gnome directory) and
internationalization.</p><p>The third part of the book is primarily a reference; and a
very useful one at that. I would recommend this book for the third
part and the appendices alone. For those who would rather compile
it themselves instead of downloading a prepackaged version, chapter
20 explains how to install and build the GNOME source code. Chapter
21 is a list of GTK+ widgets, from
<span   class="bold"><b>GtkAccelLabel to GtkWindow</b></span>, with
information on each (such as inheritance, function lists and
example code). Chapter 22 does the same for GNOME widgets. While
GNOME is multi-platform, it is primarily used under Linux; thus,
there are some Linux-specific issues which are covered in Chapter
23. Finally, for those programmers migrating over from Windows,
Chapter 24 provides a comparative, point-by-point study of how
Win32 and GNOME programming differ.</p><p>The appendices are quite useful as well, and they are where
much of the meat in the reference section is located. The first
appendix simply describes the contents of the CD-ROM, while the
second explains how to set up your machine for software development
with GNOME. The third appendix lays out the inheritance for each
widget in GTK+ and GNOME, the fifth explains how to set and get
arguments, and the fourth covers enumerated types used in GTK+ and
GNOME (such as GTK_ACCEL_SIGNAL_VISIBLE). The sixth appendix lists
all the signals, and the final appendix provides a useful list of
functions, sorted by return type.</p><p>Is it worth the money? If you're interested in programming
with GTK+ and/or GNOME, then the answer is a resounding yes. And
even if you're not, it's a cool-looking Linux book that can sit on
your desk and make you look smarter.</p></div></div>
