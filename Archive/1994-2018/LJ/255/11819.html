Connect to the Internet, work with your files, lock your workspace,
listen to music and do so much more with the
help of Bluetooth technology.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x22591f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In an effort to bring more comfort and security to listening to music
via headphones while cycling, Swedish telecom vendor Ericsson invented
Bluetooth&mdash;a wireless connectivity technology, which dates back to
1994. Since then, the standards behind Bluetooth have greatly evolved, but
it still remains a niche technology, not widely used outside traditional
business applications.
</p><p>
How can you benefit from using Linux on a Bluetooth-equipped PC? There
are many use cases, some of which are unconventional and even
mind-blowing. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x2259408"></a>
Friendly Recon</h2></div></div><p>
Bluetooth in Linux is powered by the BlueZ software stack. It includes
basic tools for remote device discovery and setup. Using it, you can
collect some helpful information about the devices and people
around you.
</p><p>
To start, let's see what devices are reachable for local
discovery:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hcitool scan
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll get a list of devices with their BD_ADDR values (similar to MAC)
and possibly text descriptions. These descriptions are optional, and some
users advisedly leave them blank. But still there's a way to find some
information on such devices. You can find the class code of a device if
you run the <tt  >hcitool inq</tt> command. After that, you can analyze it with the
Bclassify utility (<a href="http://github.com/mikeryan/btclassify" target="_self">github.com/mikeryan/btclassify</a>), which accepts class
code as an input parameter and gives back class disentanglement. Here
is the example 0x5a020c code:


<pre     class="programlisting">
atolstoy@linux:~/Downloads/btclassify-master&gt; ./btclassify.py 
 &#8618;0x5a020c
0x5a020c: Phone (Smartphone): Telephony, Object Transfer, 
 &#8618;Capturing, Networking
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can find what services are supported by the device. Here is
the sample output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
atolstoy@linux:~&gt; sdptool browse 11:22:33:44:55:66 | 
 &#8618;grep Service\ Name
Service Name: Headset Gateway
Service Name: Handsfree Gateway
Service Name: Sim Access Server
Service Name: AV Remote Control Target
Service Name: Advanced Audio
Service Name: Android Network Access Point
Service Name: Android Network User
Service Name: OBEX Phonebook Access Server
Service Name: SMS Message Access
Service Name: OBEX Object Push
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that <tt  >sdptool</tt> works even when the device is not discoverable, but
is somewhere nearby. Using that technique, you can discover smartphones,
headsets, printers, wearable gadgets and, of course, desktops and
laptops. On many Mac OS X systems, Bluetooth is set in discoverable
mode silently and forever, plus it carries the owner's name in the device's
description, which is perfect for amateur social engineering.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x22598d8"></a>
Handle and Browse Your Files</h2></div></div><p>
Although a Bluetooth connection is not very speedy when it comes to
transferring files, it still is a viable option. In Linux, there are
several ways to access your device's memory via Bluetooth, and all of
them play with the OBEX protocol.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11819f1.large.jpg"><img src="11819f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. If your neighborhood is densely populated, you'll see an
abundance of ready-to-connect Bluetooth devices.
</p></div></div><p>
To make use of it, you'll need a phone or a smartphone that supports
ObexFTP service. Most legacy devices do, but some modern Android
smartphones don't include ObexFS support by default. Luckily, you 
easily can fix it by installing a third-party Obex server from Google Play
(like this: <a href="http://bit.ly/1BjUkEw" target="_self">bit.ly/1BjUkEw</a>) and re-connecting your device with the Linux
PC. After that, both GNOME Bluetooth and Bluedevil will show you an option
for browsing the device, and if you click it, a Nautilus/Nemo/Dolphin
window will appear with your device's contents.
</p><p>
However, let's go a little further this time and mount a Bluetooth device
as a regular filesystem.
</p><p>
Assuming that you know its BD address and created a directory for
mounting, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obexfs -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 /path/to/directory
</pre>
</p><p>
To unmount it, use the <tt  >fusermount</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fusermount -u /path/to/directory
</pre>
</p><p>
You even can do an auto-mounting of your Bluetooth filesystem in the
traditional UNIX-style way. Just add the following line to your
/etc/fstab:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obexfs#-b11-22-33-44-55-66 /path/to/directory 
 &#8618;fuse allow_other 0 0 
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, only the current user will see the mounted filesystem. That's
why the <tt  >allow_other</tt> option is needed. Keep in mind that it might be a
security risk to allow everybody to see remote filesystems.
</p><p>
The <tt  >obexftp</tt> command is used for sending and receiving files without
mounting a filesystem. You can send any file to your device by issuing
a command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obexftp -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -p /some/file/to.put
</pre>
</p><p>
The file will land in the default &ldquo;Received files&rdquo; directory on your
device. To retrieve a file from the phone, just change the command
a little:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obexftp -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -g to.get
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x225a220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where the &ldquo;to.get&rdquo; file must reside in the phone's shared
folder. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x225a380"></a>
Play with Proximity</h2></div></div><p>
The Bluetooth receiver in Linux is managed via the BlueZ software stack,
which, in turn, can scan your surroundings for other Bluetooth devices. A
common case is a desktop or laptop PC, which you can pair with your
smartphone. On the PC side, the Bluetooth adapter not only scans the range
(it's the <tt  >hcitool scan</tt> command), but it also estimates the strength of
the signal. The stronger the signal, the closer the device is. You can make
use of it if you associate a change in proximity with some action. For
example, you can lock your PC when you're away and unlock it when you
approach it again. From a third-party's view, this will look like magic.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11819f2.large.jpg"><img src="11819f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. After spending a couple minutes to fine-tune proximity
settings, you can surprise your friends with a PC that responds to your
approach.
</p></div></div><p>
Linux has 
a ready-to-use solution for this purpose, and it's
called Blueproximity. The utility is a Python wrapper over the
<tt  >rfcomm</tt> and
<tt  >hcitool</tt> commands, with a nice GTK2 user interface. Blueproximity is
widely available across most Linux distributions, so just install it
using your standard package manager.
</p><p>
After you launch the application, a tray icon will appear on your
panel. Click it to open the Blueproximity settings window. Make sure
you've enabled the Bluetooth discovery on your phone, and then press the
&ldquo;Scan for devices&rdquo; button. Select your phone (a caption will help you
recognize it) and then go to the Proximity details tab. Here you can
adjust the locking and unlocking distance and duration. Drag the sliders to make
the values work best. The values depend on your room configuration, Bluetooth
adapter active range and numerous other details. But to make things
work, go to the Locking tab and make sure the commands there work for
you. The Blueproximity defaults are designed to work in GNOME, Mate, XFCE,
Cinnamon and Unity environments, so if you happen to use one of those,
no changes are needed. In the case of KDE, use the following replacements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qdbus org.kde.screensaver /ScreenSaver Lock 
 &#8618;// for locking the screen
qdbus | grep kscreenlocker_greet | xargs -I {} qdbus 
 &#8618;{} /MainApplication quit // for unlocking
qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver 
 &#8618;SimulateUserActivity // for simulating user activity.
</pre>
</p><p>
After you close the Settings window, you're ready for a test run.
Walk back and forth to make sure that the values in Blueproximity are
comfortable, and try the auto-locking and unlocking trick. If for
some reason you need to monitor the proximity without bringing the
Blueproximity setting window to the front, use the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
watch -n 0.5 hcitool rssi 11:22:33:44:55:66
</pre>
</p><p>
where 0.5 is the refresh period and 11:22:33:44:55:66 is your phone's BD
ADDR address. To find your address, simply run <tt  >hcitool
scan</tt>
on the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x225aa60"></a>
Back in Dial-up Times</h2></div></div><p>
It's always good to have a backup Internet connection. Sometimes your main
provider fails, or there is some service downtime, or whatever. Having
another connection via your mobile carrier is great, but you may want
to share this connection on your desktop PC. Basically, there are two
methods for accomplishing it: launching a Wi-Fi ad hoc spot on a phone
and connecting with Bluetooth. Let's look at the latter case.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11819f3.large.jpg"><img src="11819f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Although it looks like a retro type of connectivity, PPP perfectly
supports all the latest tech novelties, including broadband LTE.
</p></div></div><p>
Pairing your phone with a PC via Bluetooth is commonly done for browsing
files, while binding makes the phone accessible as a /dev/rfcommX device
(usually rfcomm0). This is a network device, and it can be used in the
same way as a dial-up modem. After that, you can set a
PPP (point-to-point) connection either with NetworkManager, KPPP,
wvdial or the standard network-managing commands of your system (like
the legacy <tt  >ifup</tt>/<tt  >ifdown</tt>
commands). Here, I cover the KPPP method. Once
you install the KPPP package, you're ready to go.
</p><p>
First, make sure your phone can access the Internet&mdash;this can
narrow your search for a bottleneck if something goes wrong. Mobile phones
are capable of doing this since the early 2000s, although 3G and LTE speeds
came later. Then enable Bluetooth on the phone and make it discoverable
(for security reasons, it is disabled by default on most devices).
</p><p>
On the desktop side, you'll need to pair your phone with a PC. In the
past, this was done manually by changing the BlueZ config files, but on
modern desktops, all you have to do is use either the GNOME Bluetooth applet
or Bluedevil to create a simple pairing.
</p><p>
Check whether your device has emerged on the PC side by issuing the
<tt  >sudo
ls /dev/rfcomm*</tt> command. If it's not there, you'll need to do things
manually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hcitool scan // find your phone's address
sdptool search DUN // find the channel for dial-up networking (DUN)
rfcomm bind 11:22:33:44:55:66 1 (where 1 is a channel number)
sudo chmod 777 /dev/rfcomm0 // that will let us run KPPP 
 &#8618;without root privileges
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, it's time to run KPPP and set the connection details. Click
Configure&rarr;Modems&rarr;New, and select /dev/rfcomm0 as your device. Press
the &ldquo;Query Modem...&rdquo; button, and make sure that the modem device responds.
</p><p>
To establish a connection, you will need to alter the &ldquo;Initialization
string 1&rdquo;, which is in the &ldquo;Modem Commands&rdquo; window. The string differs
between carriers, so you'll need to get the proper one. For example,
Verizon in the US accepts the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AT+CGDCONT=3,"IPV4V6","vzwinternet","0.0.0.0",0,0
</pre>
</p><p>
When your modem is set up, create a standard connection in KPPP. The only
thing you need to know is the dial-in number, which can look like *99***3#
(for example, for Verizon). The user name and password fields can be left blank or filled
with random characters, as they're not required. Finally, press the
Connect button in the main KPPP window and wait for a successful link.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x2653498"></a>
Audio Playback</h2></div></div><p>
A useful and impressive trick is streaming your audio playback
from your Bluetooth-enabled phone to your desktop PC (perhaps with 
powerful speakers attached). Or, it can be applied to your car system,
so you can listen to your favorite tunes while driving.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11819f4.large.jpg"><img src="11819f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Previous versions of BlueZ in Linux required extra skill to
stream audio to remote output. Now all the setup steps are just a few clicks
away.
</p></div></div><p>
The setup procedure is straightforward, because your phone services are
discovered automatically when it is paired with a PC. After that, open
your Pulseaudio control window (Pavucontrol or Audio and Video Settings
in KDE's system settings) and find your phone as an Input device. In the case
of Android phones, enable multimedia streaming in the Bluetooth settings,
and you're done.
</p><p>
Thanks to Pulseaudio, you can use your Bluetooth headset in a similar
way&mdash;set it as a priority recording and playback device. To do this,
you'll have to switch the profile from A2DP (high-quality stereo) to
HSF/HFP (headset mode). It plays and records only in mono, but you can
get an extra benefit from Pulseaudio by utilizing it as a built-in noise and
echo filter. For example, let's launch Skype with that filter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PULSE_PROP="filter.want=echo-cancel" skype
</pre>
</p><p>
You can switch between Pulseaudio output (sinks) and input (sources)
devices using the <tt  >pactl</tt> and
<tt  >pacmd</tt> commands, which work the same way
on any Linux system.
</p><p>
The opposite way is limited though. You can stream audio from your
Linux PC to a headset or Bluetooth speakers, but in the case of Android
phones, it's possible only via Wi-Fi, not Bluetooth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x2653a18"></a>
Extract Contacts and SMS</h2></div></div><p>
This mostly applies to older phones, like the Nokia S40 and S60
phones, Sony Ericsson and so on. These phones still are widely used as
backup phones, because they're rugged, friendly and easy to use. Unlike modern
smartphones running Android or iOS, these mobile phones don't have advanced
sync options with on-line services. Instead, you can retrieve various data
stored on such a phone via Bluetooth. This is particularly useful if
you own an old mobile phone, and there's no way to get into its memory other
than wirelessly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11819f5.large.jpg"><img src="11819f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A phone itself might not be worth a penny, but if it stores
precious content, it can be carefully retrieved and saved by Wammu.
</p></div></div><p>
On Linux, there's a mature and feature-rich application for that purpose:
Wammu. Go ahead and install it from your favorite Linux distribution (it's
available almost everywhere). Once it is installed, launch it and follow
the first-time connection wizard. When prompted about connection type,
choose Bluetooth, enable it on the phone and click Next. The wizard
may ask you a few more details about the connection, but you should
be finished in a minute or two. Thousands of phones are supported,
so your model most likely will be on the whitelist.
</p><p>
In the main Wammu window, choose Phone&rarr;Connect, and make sure the
connection is established. Now you can retrieve data from the phone,
including Contacts (either on SIM or in phone memory, or both), Calls
History, Messages, To-Dos and Calendar. All of those options are available
from the Retrieve menu. Whatever you choose, no changes will be made
on the phone side, so it's absolutely safe.
</p><p>
The left part of the Wammu window hosts a category tree, where you
can switch from one data section to another. You can add, edit or remove
items and contents, which is far more comfortable than struggling with
phone controls and reading a tiny screen. One of Wammu's best features is
the ability to back up and restore retrieved data. Look under the Backups
menu for importing/exporting and saving options. If you wish to transfer
data from one phone to another, there's no better choice than Wammu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2161580.0x2653de0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi</b></p><p>
Many actions can be done via both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so you may
be curious about why one would use Bluetooth. The technologies are totally
different. They have different purposes and even different power
requirements. Bluetooth devices emit a signal that travels for about 30
feet, while Wi-Fi signals travel about ten times as far, which results
in much a higher power consumption in the case of Wi-Fi.
</p><p>
Bluetooth also can be a better solution for older PCs that you might want
to breathe new life into.
Instead of obtaining a Wi-Fi module,
try a Bluetooth USB dongle. This will result in a much more versatile
usage, including Internet access.
