A few months back, I accidentally left my phone on the nightstand, and
spent an entire day without my cell phone. It was a terrible experience.
Don't get me wrong, I fully understand the concept of taking a vacation
from technology. I also realize there are times when using a mobile device
is inappropriate. The terrible part was that although I functioned perfectly
fine, being disconnected was incredibly inconvenient. It wasn't until that
day that I finally realized just how much more I can accomplish simply by being
connected. As technologists, we all celebrate the awesome world of mobile
computing, and this month, we devote <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> to the concept as well.

Reuven M. Lerner and I both tackle databases this month. Reuven describes
how to handle table relationships inside Django. If you're a Python
programmer, Django is an incredibly powerful Web framework, and most Web
apps rely on databases for their back-end data storage. My article is far
less developer-centric, as I discuss how to interact with a MySQL database
directly from the command line. Programs like PHPMyadmin and Adminer are
great, but it's important for a system administrator to know how the
command-line interface works as well.
</p><p>
Dave Taylor goes back to the basics with shell scripting this month and
explains how to take advantage of functions. Separating parts of code
into reusable functions is a very efficient way to program in any language,
and with shell scripting, it also makes the code much easier to read and
understand. Instead of focusing on software, in this issue, Kyle Rankin
focuses on hardware.
Specifically, he talks about the current 3D
printing hardware in part two of his four-part series on 3D printing. Whether
you've been fiddling with 3D printing since it became mainstream a few
years ago or are just getting into the game now, Kyle's series will
bring you up to date in no time.

Although many folks still think &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo; is the name of the wireless
earpieces often seen on folks in power suits, we all know that it's
actually just the wireless communication technology. Almost all mobile
devices and computers have Bluetooth built in nowadays, and Alexander
Tolstoy discusses how to take advantage of that availability. 
He shows a handful of hacks you can do to make use of that
personal area network space with such a funny name.
</p><p>
Andrey Katsman takes a deep look at, well, everything. Specifically he
discusses The Internet of Things, or how our entire world is beginning to
join in a giant network. Andrey talks about microcontrollers, connectivity
and how Linux is playing a vital role in not really taking over the world,
but rather becoming what &ldquo;the world&rdquo; means. If you enjoy living in the
future as much as I do, you don't want to miss his article.
</p><p>
Finally, Michael Pozhidaev dives into an important and fascinating topic.
How do you best create a user interface for a computer that is effective
and useful for the blind? So much of how we design interfaces is based on
visual layouts, non-visual functionality often takes a big hit. Michael
introduces us to Luwrain this month, which is a Linux distribution designed
to forget about eye candy and focus on usability for those who can't see
the eye candy anyway. By designing interfaces that are useful and effective
for sensory input and output other than visual, ideally we can come up with
better user interfaces in general.

Mobile technology is a buzzword that might be starting to lose its meaning
in modern culture. We're getting to the point where most technology is
mobile, and soon we'll either be wearing or holding in our hands all the
technology we interact with on a daily basis. As I write this on a desktop
computer, however, I realize we're not quite there. This issue explores a
lot of mobile-related topics, and it also contains tech tips,
product announcements, and many other useful items that all continue to
blur the line between mobile and non-mobile. We hope you enjoy this issue,
which you probably are reading on a mobile device! (As long as you
remembered to charge it, that is.)
