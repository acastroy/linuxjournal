Django provides excellent support for relationships among database tables.
Here's how you can define those relationships in your projects.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251f580.0x2617358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last few articles, I've looked at Django, a powerful
Python-based Web framework. I discussed how Django projects are
built out of individual, reusable applications. I also covered how Django's
templates provide flexibility, while avoiding the use of
explicit code within the template files themselves. Then I showed how you
can use Django's ORM (object-relational manager) to define your
models, which then were translated into table-creation queries in SQL.
Finally, I explained how you can, through your models, access the
database&mdash;creating, modifying and even deleting database records using Python
objects.
</p><p>
So in this article, I'm going to finish this exploration of Django, looking
at one final part of any application that uses a relational database:
how you can define, and then use, associations among
your Django models.
</p><p>
Relational databases have been around for several decades, and despite
the hype surrounding NoSQL databases of various sorts, one of their
great strengths is the ease with which you can combine information from
different sources, mix and match them together, and then produce a
result. Perhaps this isn't always true; in particular, relational
databases often work poorly with hierarchical data. But the idea that
you can read from several tables, combine them in a variety of ways,
and get precisely the answer you were looking for, is not only
powerful, but also addictive once you get used to it.
</p><p>
Thus, if you're using Django along with a relational database, you're
likely going to want to use those relations with your Django models.
However, it's not always obvious how you can do this. Here,
I take a look at the three different types of relationships you can
create among models (and thus SQL tables) and see how Django
supports those relationships.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251f580.0x2617618"></a>
One-to-One Relationships</h2></div></div><p>
The first and easiest to understand relationship between models is
the one-to-one relationship. This means each model has one and only
one corresponding model in another class. (At the database level, it
means every row has one and only one row in another table.)
</p><p>
For example, let's say I'm in charge of a bus company, in
which each bus is assigned to a specific driver. For every driver,
there is a bus. And, for every bus, there is a driver. The
relationship in this case is one-to-one.
</p><p>
I created a small Django project (&ldquo;buscompany&rdquo;) to demonstrate
this
and an application (&ldquo;schedule&rdquo;) inside that project:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ django-admin.py startproject buscompany
$ cd buscompany
$ python manage.py startapp schedule
</pre>
</p><p>
In order for my Django project to recognize and work with my new
application, I need to add it to the application's settings. This
means going into the application's settings.py and adding the
following line to the definition of <tt  >INSTALLED_APPS</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
'schedule'
</pre>
</p><p>
Once an application is installed
into a Django project, the project will recognize the application's
model and other definitions.
</p><p>
Inside the &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; application, I then create two models: one
for buses, and the other for drivers. Both of these are defined in
schedule/models.py:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Driver(models.Model):
first_name = models.TextField()
last_name = models.TextField()
birthdate = models.DateField()

def __str__(self):
    return "{} {}".format(self.first_name,
              self.last_name)


class Bus(models.Model):
registration_number = models.TextField()
license_plate = models.TextField()
purchased_on = models.DateField()
driver = models.OneToOneField(Driver)

def __str__(self):
    return "Vehicle license {}".format(self.license_plate)
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, I have defined a <tt  >Driver</tt> class, and a
<tt  >Bus</tt> class. In
particular, note the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; attribute
defined in <tt  >Bus</tt>, and that it is defined to be an instance of
<tt  >models.OneToOneField</tt>. I indicate that this attribute should be linked
to the <tt  >Driver</tt> class by passing it as a parameter to
<tt  >models.OneToOneField</tt>.
</p><p>
Once I have created these basic model definitions, I can put them
into practice by creating and then running the migrations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the migrations have been run, the database will contain the
models I want. But more important, an instance of
<tt  >Bus</tt> now
can be linked to an instance of <tt  >Driver</tt>. For example,
next I create a
driver using the Django management shell:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python manage.py shell
&gt;&gt;&gt; from schedule.models import Bus, Driver

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Driver(birthdate='1980-01-01', first_name='Mr.',
&gt;&gt;&gt; last_name='Driver')
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.save()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.id       # Returns 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can use this new driver's ID when creating a new
<tt  >Bus</tt> object:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bus(driver_id=1, license_plate='abc123',
            purchased_on='2015-01-01', registration_number=123)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.save()
</pre>
</p><p>
With the above in place, I can get the driver via the bus, and vice
versa:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(b.driver)
'Mr. Driver'

&gt;&gt;&gt; str(d.bus)
'Vehicle license abc123'
</pre>
</p><p>
And of course, if I want to retrieve specific fields from an
associated object, I can do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.bus.registration_number
u'123'
</pre>
</p><p>
With this relationship in place, I now can produce a table of drivers
and buses that the bus company's management can use to see the
current allocation of drivers and buses.
</p><p>
I want to add two quick points to the above design. First and
foremost, a one-to-one relationship is inherently double-sided. That
is, both models effectively see a one-to-one relationship. You can,
in Django, define the relationship on whichever object you wish. The
results will be the same; the appropriate attributes will be created
in both directions.
</p><p>
The second thing to notice, and remember, is that Django assumes,
unless you explicitly say otherwise, that database columns
are NOT
NULL. This means if I try to create a bus without an associated
driver:


<pre     class="programlisting">
b2 = Bus(license_plate='abc456',
     purchased_on='2015-02-02', registration_number=456)
b2.save()
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251f580.0x2618590"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Django will throw an IntegrityError exception, because I have not
specified anything for the <tt  >driver_id</tt> column. When
creating your models, you will have to
decide whether you want to have the added
flexibility of NOT NULL columns&mdash;which, in this case, might indicate
that a bus has not (yet) been allocated to a driver&mdash;or the added
integrity of NOT NULL columns.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251f580.0x26186f0"></a>
One-to-Many Relationships</h2></div></div><p>
The above works well when you have a simple, one-to-one relationship.
However, life is a bit more complex than that. You often encounter
situations where you need a one-to-many relationship. For example,
let's assume my bus company wants to make the most of its buses.
Thus, there isn't just one driver associated with a bus, but rather a
number of possible drivers associated with a bus.
</p><p>
As things currently stand, that's not possible; a given bus can 
have only a single driver at a time. In order to change this, and to allow
multiple drivers to drive the same bus (although not simultaneously,
one would hope), I need to change the association. Instead of a
one-to-one relationship between buses and drivers, there now will be a
one-to-many relationship.
</p><p>
In SQL, you would accomplish this by having two separate tables: one
for drivers and one for buses. Because one bus could have multiple
drivers, I would put a &ldquo;bus&rdquo; foreign key in the drivers table. In
this way, each driver would point to a single bus, but a bus could be
affiliated with multiple drivers.
</p><p>
When one table references another in the database world, it's called
using a &ldquo;foreign key&rdquo;. And so it shouldn't come as a surprise that in
Django, I need to modify my models, removing the
<tt  >OneToOneField</tt>
from <tt  >Bus</tt> and adding a
<tt  >ForeignKey</tt> field in <tt  >Driver</tt>.
The models 
then will look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.db import models

class Bus(models.Model):
registration_number = models.TextField()
license_plate = models.TextField()
purchased_on = models.DateField()

def __str__(self):
    return "Vehicle license {}".format(self.license_plate)

class Driver(models.Model):
first_name = models.TextField()
last_name = models.TextField()
birthdate = models.DateField()
bus = models.ForeignKey(Bus)

def __str__(self):
    return "{} {}".format(self.first_name,
              self.last_name)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I flipped the order of the models definitions, so that
<tt  >Bus</tt>
would be recognized as a known class name to Python when I define the
<tt  >Driver</tt> class.
</p><p>
As always in Django, I then tell the system to create a migration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python manage.py makemigrations
</pre>
</p><p>
But in this particular case, because I already have added some records
to my database, Django refuses to continue. It warns me that I'm
asking to create a new field (&ldquo;bus&rdquo;) on the
<tt  >Driver</tt> model, but that
because there already are records, and because the field is defined as
&ldquo;not null&rdquo; (the default in Django), the migration cannot work. Django
thus gives me the choice between providing a default for existing
records or for quitting from the migrations and trying again later.
I decided to choose a default and then entered 1, the ID of the bus
in my system.
</p><p>
Once that was done, Django finished making the migrations. I ran them
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ python manage.py migrate

$ python manage.py shell

&gt;&gt;&gt; from schedule.models import Bus, Driver
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Driver.objects.first()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.bus
&lt;Bus: Vehicle license abc123&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
So far, so good&mdash;my driver has a bus. Let's add another driver for
the same bus:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = Driver(birthdate='1980-02-02', first_name='Ms.',
                last_name='AlsoDriver', bus_id=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2.save()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2.bus
&lt;Bus: Vehicle license abc123&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now I have two drivers who work with the same bus. Does the bus know
this? Let's find out:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bus.objects.first()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.driver_set.all()
[&lt;Driver: Mr. Driver&gt;, &lt;Driver: Ms. AlsoDriver&gt;]

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, I find that when I retrieve the
<tt  >driver_set</tt> from the
bus and then ask Django to provide me with the objects themselves, I
get the two drivers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251f580.0x260fa80"></a>
Many-to-Many Relationships</h2></div></div><p>
The above is fine if each driver uses only a single bus. But it's more
likely that each driver will use a number of different buses, and that
each bus will have a number of different drivers. In such a case, this
existing model will not allow me to describe the data; instead of a
one-to-many relationship, I need a many-to-many relationship. This
is a common thing in the data-modeling world; consider the
relationship between authors and books, or ingredients and recipes, or
classes in school, and you'll see that a many-to-many relationship is
often the best (and only) way to model things correctly.
</p><p>
In a relational database, there's no way for two tables to 
have a many-to-many relationship directly. Rather, you have to create a
&ldquo;join
table&rdquo;, a third table in which the relations are listed. Django
understands this and allows you to define a many-to-many relationship
by creating a <tt  >ManyToManyField</tt> on one of the models. Django then
creates the join table for you. Let's modify my Driver model, so that
they'll have this relationship:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Driver(models.Model):
first_name = models.TextField()
last_name = models.TextField()
birthdate = models.DateField()
bus = models.ManyToManyField(Bus)

def __str__(self):
    return "{} {}".format(self.first_name,
              self.last_name)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I put the <tt  >ManyToManyField</tt> only on one of the classes and
not both of them. I then create and run my migrations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I re-enter the Django shell and re-configure the associations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Driver.objects.get(id=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.bus.add(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.save()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.bus.add(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.save()

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.bus.all()
[&lt;Bus: Vehicle license abc123&gt;, 
 &#8618;&lt;Bus: Vehicle license xyz987&gt;]
</pre>
</p><p>
After executing the above, I similarly added a second driver to each
of the buses. Do I see the results of this on the other side? Let's
find out:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bus.objects.get(id=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.driver_set.all()
[&lt;Driver: Mr. Driver&gt;, &lt;Driver: Ms. AlsoDriver&gt;]

</pre>
</p><p>
Indeed, you can see that associating a bus and driver can be
done from either side. The fact that a join table exists is
transparent; Django creates and maintains that table for you,
part of its general approach of helping you concentrate on the
important aspects of your projects, rather than the nuts and bolts that
happen behind the scenes.
</p><p>
This concludes my tour of many of Django's major features, which
started a few months ago. If you're a Python developer, and if
you are interested in creating complex Web applications, there's
no doubt that Django is the way to go. If you're looking to do
something simpler, I'd suggest Flask&mdash;but only you know how
complex your system will be. There's no doubt that if you have an
ambitious Web application that will use a database, Django is up to
the task and is worth serious consideration.
