    A computer consultant's experience in converting the SBT
    accounting system to Linux for the Maxwell House Department
    Stores.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x28204a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are many customized versions of
SBT's accounting system programs because SBT
(<a href="http://www.sbt.com" target="_self">http://www.sbt.com/</a>) has
been supplying source code with the multi-user versions of their
software for many years. The system I upgraded from SCO Xenix to
Caldera OpenLinux used SBT's Accounts Receivable/Inventory program
as the basis for a point-of-sale system. Both the original SBT
programs and the add-ons were written in SCO Foxbase plus, one of
the dBase-compatible languages. My client, Steve Maxwell, had been
using the program for about ten years to run his department stores,
and was pleased with its performance and stability. Unfortunately,
when I tested how well this software worked with dates in the year
2000, it failed. SCO Foxbase did not work correctly after 1999.
</p><p>While I was looking into the available solutions to the
problem, I found, in addition to an upgrade from SCO, a couple of
dBase-compatible languages also available for Linux. I liked a
product called FlagShip from Multisoft (sold in the U.S. by Linux
Mall,
<a href="http://www.linuxmall.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxmall.com/</a>),
because my initial tests indicated it would compile the original
SBT source code with only a few changes, which I'll detail later,
and it produced very fast code. It was also the least expensive
solution, at less than $600. FlagShip compiles the source code in a
two-step process that converts the original dBase source into C
code, which is then compiled by Linux's C compiler into a native
executable.</p><p>From the client's point of view, one of the major advantages
of the upgrade to Linux was it allowed him to use much of his
existing hardware, including the many terminals, receipt printers,
bar code scanners and so on, as well as his main computers. The
only hardware we had to replace was a 60MB tape drive and a
multiport serial card. Both were no longer manufactured and were
not supported by Linux. We upgraded the multiport serial board to a
Cyclades Cyclom Y board, and upgraded the tape drive to a Hewlett
Packard IDE 5GB unit with BRU backup software. The ability to
recycle major components saved tens of thousands of dollars. By
using the original programs, we also avoided training costs.</p><p>Since this was my first Xenix-to-Linux conversion, I was
fairly concerned I would run into an unforeseen problem that would
make the project fail. In this regard, I was fortunate to have a
very experienced client. Steve Maxwell had been involved in the
development of the original Xenix version of the programs, and had
been maintaining the system without outside support. I felt much
better having a truly smart client around, because I ran into
trouble right away: I couldn't get the information on the Xenix
system over to the Linux system. Although Linux can read Xenix file
systems, I was not able to get Linux to read the Xenix hard drive
that held the original source code and data. I was able to get the
information off of the Xenix system using a program Steve called
<span   class="bold"><b>Term</b></span>, which has both Xenix and DOS
versions. I wound up with all needed files on the DOS partition of
my Linux development system. This turned out to be quite useful in
that it allowed me to use all the DOS development tools, in
addition to the Linux tools, and produced code I could debug in
either environment.</p><p>I started the conversion by doing the Y2K work. I converted
anything that had to do with dates from the original format of 8
bytes of character data (e.g., 01/01/90) to dBase's date type. This
is the approach used by SBT for its DOS and Windows products. I
used the <b  >SET&nbsp;CENTURY&nbsp;ON</b> command to
enable four-digit years, then made the necessary changes to convert
the date where needed. This turned out to be relatively
easy.</p><p>In the next step of the conversion, I built a stripped-down
copy of the department store's system, consisting of a main
computer and a single point-of-sale workstation (a dumb terminal,
bar code scanner and receipt printer). I also set up some system
printers in the configuration used by the store.</p><p>None of the available Linux terminal types worked, and when I
logged out from the terminal, I didn't get a login prompt again.
This was something I hadn't expected and was a pain to resolve. I
eventually produced a custom <b  >terminfo</b> entry by
reverse engineering the Xenix termcap settings. The login problem
was solved by using <span   class="bold"><b>mingetty</b></span>
instead of the standard <span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span>
program. After resolving these problems I had a working
single-terminal version of the system.</p><p>The way SCO Foxplus handles a multi-user file is different
than the way FlagShip handles it. Basically, I stripped out the
Foxplus code and added the FlagShip code as needed, an easy
process, but a bit tedious since I had to add a block of FlagShip
code at each point in the program the
<span   class="bold"><b>USE</b></span> command appeared. In about a
month, I had finished all conversions and installed the Linux hard
drive (which I'd done the development on) as the main store
computer. I kept the Xenix hard drive handy, in case there was some
more trouble in the upgrade. Amazingly enough, the Linux version
worked on the first try. After that, I made minor changes to the
code to optimize the way the printers worked, but the Linux system
was up and running and I never needed to go back to Xenix.</p><p>The original point-of-sale programs supported multiple stores
by updating a set of master files through a complicated operation
involving transaction files created at each store and a batch
update process. I was able to simplify this by using Linux's
powerful communication features to connect the branch store
directly to the main store via the Internet.</p><p>I obtained two dedicated IP addresses from Gilanet, the local
ISP that serves the two towns where the stores are located, and
configured the automatic dialer program to bring up the links
during store hours and shut them down when not needed. Bill Stites,
the system administrator from Gilanet, provided great support in
getting the Internet connections working. Bill uses Caldera
OpenLinux internally for some of his Gilanet servers.</p><p>When we started this project, Steve Maxwell and I had wanted
to complete the upgrade prior to the busy Christmas season. As it
turned out, even with the problems, I was able to complete the work
in about half the expected time. The system runs
beautifully.</p></div></div>
