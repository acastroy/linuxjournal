    Of course, science, life and society being what they are (send
    me a $1,000 check for this month's definitions), the hard/soft
    debate is doomed to waffle on.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2554580.0x264c4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> There are, they say, hard and soft
sciences, not to be confused with difficult vs. easy, but more
related to claims of objective, measurable, repeatable precision
(we stout hardies) versus subjective, hand-waving,
proofs-by-assertion (you big softies). The spectrum of fuzziness
typically ranges from pure mathematics and physics at the
diamond-tipped top, then descends via chemistry and biology (almost
converging to synonyms), ending with a series of &ldquo;life&rdquo; and
&ldquo;social&rdquo; sciences. The latter at least co-opt the intentions and
vocabulary of the scientific method and rightly escape the
&ldquo;beyond-the-soggy-pale&rdquo; category of pseudo-science (astrology,
UFOlogy, pyramidiotology, hidden-Bible cryptology ... <span   class="emphasis"><em>ad
astra, ad nauseam</em></span>). Honest &ldquo;theology&rdquo; wriggles through
the colander by rejecting the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; model.
</p><p>Of course, science, life and society being what they are
(send me a $1,000 check for this month's definitions), the
hard/soft debate is doomed to waffle on. The paradox is that
comparing the hardnesses of any two disciplines requires a valid
metric&mdash;and that metric will depend on the hardness of the hardest
involved domain. You can hear the magic predicate
<span   class="emphasis"><em>meta</em></span> creeping into the equation. It reminds us
that the very foundations of the purest of pure mathematics (formal
set theory) were softened (nay, Osterized and Cuisinarted) by
G&ouml;del's meta-mathematical shocks in 1931.</p><p>It's still difficult to accept that the hardest queen of the
sciences proved so brittle after millennia of complacency. Harder
still to note that everyday mathematics and all the dependent
sciences rumbled on, regardless. However, there was a clear dent in
the traditional hierarchy.</p><p>We may avoid an arithmetical
<b  >operator&gt;&gt;</b> with a sort of
&ldquo;diamond-scratches-glass&rdquo; ordering, but that moves us to
unprovable, contentious, domain-dependent, metaphorical comparisons
(e.g., in Political Science, we readily declare that Lincoln was a
better president than Clinton).</p><p>There are other parameters available for comparing sciences.
Some, such as &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo;, are possibly more determinable and
worthy of discussion. Thus, cosmology (already disputed in the
hard/soft science ratings since we can't, as yet or ever, repeat
the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; experiment, do a tachyon glide into the local
wormhole, or contact our nearest parallel universe) seems to offer
useless theories and predictions: whether the cosmos expands
forever or collapses after 10 billion years is, to most readers of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Angela's Ashes</em></span>, hardly even worth
mentioning.</p><p>What of our provably most useful sciences: economics and
computer science? Demi-soft economics has been dubbed the
&ldquo;dismal&rdquo; science, while semi-hard computer science must surely be
the most boring (most of its formal results, dated 1935, are proofs
that &ldquo;this is impossible&mdash;don't bother!&rdquo;) Yet hand-in-hand, both
sciences have triggered the most undismal, unboring IPO
stock-market episodes since the South Sea bubble. What is anything
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> worth? Forget the Marxian
cosource-sweat-value-added axioms. If dazed bidders offer $1
million for a single Yahoo Japan share, then that is, by
definition, its current &ldquo;worth&rdquo;. Next question? Red Hat may or
may not fairly distribute its IPO gains, but they missed out 500%
by not calling themselves e-Red e-Hat e-Linux. And just wait until
I launch e-skb-gnu-e-free-hardware.com.</p></div></div>
