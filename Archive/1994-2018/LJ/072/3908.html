to make my partitions for Linux, it gives me an error saying &ldquo;boot
partition too big&rdquo;. I tried to use
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> and it says my hard drive
has 1655 cylinders, not 1024, and it will cause problems. How can I
get around this?  &mdash;Will Brown, willj3@mindspring.com
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Create a primary partition (the first one) with
10MB; its mount point should be /boot. This is the directory where
all the boot images reside, and it</em></span> needs to be under the
1024 cylinder. The root partition (/) can then be any size, and
will not have any problems.  &mdash;Paulo Wollny,
paulo@wollny.com.br</p><p>Most PC bioses are still unable to access data beyond the
1024th cylinder. This prevents LILO from booting a kernel that's
lying beyond the 1024th cylinder. To get around this, short of
getting an alternate architecture without all those ancestral PC
limitations, you need to have your boot partition (either /boot if
you have one, or your root partition otherwise) completely under
the 1024th cylinder.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199b580.0x1a933f8"></a>Home Networking</h2></div></div><p>I am setting up a small LAN at home with a server running Red
Hat 6.1 and a workstation running Windows 98. I've set each up with
a static IP address (192.168.1.1-2) and a netmask of 255.255.255.0.
My problem is that I can't even ping my Linux box using the host
name. I can ping it using the IP address, and I can ping my Windows
98 box from the Linux box using either the host name or the IP
address. I'd appreciate any suggestions you may have.</p><p>I had an older version of Linux (Red Hat 5.3, I believe) on
the server, and it was working perfectly. I've set up the 6.1
version the same way and it won't work.  &mdash;Greg Wright,
grewright@netzero.net</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>You didn't mention whether you've configured DNS
services at home, so I'll assume you have not. In that case, you
need to add an entry to your c:\windows\hosts file. List the IP
address of the system you are trying to ping, followed by the host
name you wish to use in your ping test. Be sure you do</em></span>
not include the domain name in this entry. You can copy the file
hosts.sam if you need a sample.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,

office (192.168.1.0) and the other at the branch (192.168.2.0). I
used two Cisco 800 routers to connect them. I can use TCP/IP
normally (ping, ftp, http from one host to another). My problem is
I cannot see the remote PCs in Windows Explorer at the office. I
configured a Linux server with DNS, mail and FTP, but it still
doesn't work. At the office, I'm running IPX (there is a Netware
3.11 server) and TCP/IP protocols. Someone told me I must set up a
Windows NT running WINS service. I don't want to install Windows
NT. Any ideas?  &mdash;Carlos Germ&aacute;n Siufi,
csiufi@puntoar.net.ar</p><p>This question involves Windows networking, and more
specifically, netbios name lookup. Netbios, which is at the core of
Windows networking, was very badly designed and grew from there.
While UNIX uses DNS for name lookup, Windows originally used a
complicated name lookup scheme based on the election of a local
name browser on your subnet and broadcast queries for each name
lookup. Because it is broadcast-based, it doesn't work across
subnets (which is your configuration), and it was &ldquo;improved&rdquo; with
the addition of WINS.</p><p>The typical solution is indeed to use a WINS server, which is
some kind of dynamic DNS equivalent, although it isn't as robust.
However, you do not need to run Windows to provide WINS service;
Samba
(<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">http://www.samba.org/</a>)
can do this just fine. While using a WINS server would typically
require you to configure each Windows machine, Samba can function
as a proxy between local broadcast queries and a remote WINS
server. You ought to grab Samba and read its documentation for more
info. You may also want to consider getting one of the Samba
books.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199b580.0x1a93818"></a>Setting Display Mode</h2></div></div><p>I need to know how to set my display mode when I start the X
Window System. It always runs X at 320x300 or something really huge
and I can't do anything. I use&mdash;Jim, jim@stat.net</p><p>Red Hat's X configuration tool is called
<span   class="bold"><b>Xconfigurator</b></span>. If it doesn't work
for you, then you should first check that your graphics card is
supported by your version of XFree86 at
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/#resources" target="_self">http://www.xfree86.org/#resources/</a>.
It may be that your video card is supported by a later version of
X, in which case you should upgrade. If your video card is recent,
it is most likely Vesa 2-compatible, and you can use the VesaFB
server:

Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199b580.0x1a93a80"></a>Ethernet Cards</h2></div></div><p>I want to convert my existing proxy server for my home
network to Linux. But every distribution I have used has never
detected both network cards until SuSE 6.3. I can manually get the
card on the LAN to find the DHCP server, and the NT gives it an IP
address, but can never ping that server; if I change it to a static
IP address, it pings the NT server fine. The real problem is I have
a cable modem on the other NIC, on which I have set up DHCPclient.
I have viewed and edited the sbin/init.d/dhclient file to make sure
it has the <b  >ifconfig $NETDEV 0.0.0.0 up</b> statement
in it. I have read the FAQ and I still cannot get this to
work.  &mdash;Stephen Heaton, srheaton@mediaone.net</p><p>All recent distributions work more or less the same in regard
to more than one Ethernet card if they are PCI, as they can all be
autodetected easily. You may, however, need to add an alias for
eth1 in /etc/conf.modules. For example, your conf.modules could
look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias eth0 tulip
alias eth1 eepro100
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>After that, you simply need to ifconfig each card
in the usual fashion.</em></span>
</p><p>Are you sure that Linux does receive a correct IP, netmask
and broadcast from the DHCP server? You should type ifconfig eth0
(or eth1) and compare the info you're getting from DHCP with the
info you're setting by hand.</p><p>The last part, I'm not too sure about. I myself haven't had
much luck with SuSE's DHCP client, while Red Hat's dhcp client has
worked better for me with no special configuration required.  &mdash;Marc
