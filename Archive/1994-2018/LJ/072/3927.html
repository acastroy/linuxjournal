    As of the end of last year, there were over 68 million
    hosts attached to the Internet, and those hosts average
    four users each.

the ARPANET was installed in Len Kleinrock's lab at UCLA. A month
later, the second went into Doug Engelbart's at SRI in Menlo Park,
CA.
</p><p>As of the end of last year, there were over 68 million hosts
attached to the Internet, and those hosts average four users each.
A quarter of a billion folks all over the world.</p><p>I really do mean all over.</p><p>The latest analysis by MIDS
(<a href="http://www.mids.org" target="_self">http://www.mids.org/</a>) of
the data assembled by Network Wizards shows host sites in over 200
countries or territories&mdash;far more than the members of the
UN.</p><p>MIDS noted a year ago that while the Internet was growing,
the growth rate, which had shown a factor of two or better (i.e.,
the size of the Internet doubled each year) for just over a decade,
was beginning to slow. The four most recent data points (January
1998, July 1998, January 1999, July 1999) show the growth rate to
be 1.5 now. This is still a lot.</p><p>The 68 million of January 2000 is projected to become 100
million this year, 150 million at the end of 2001, and 225 million
at the end of 2002.</p><p>If we assume the average will stay at four, that's a billion
people in less than three years.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2587580.0x267f978"></a>Why Has the Growth Been So Incredible?</h2></div></div><p>I think there are several factors: first, the advent of the
Hayes modem. The progress from 1969 to 1975 brought us from the
half-rack that was used in the original ARPANET to the shoebox of
the acoustic modem. The subsequent reduction in size (and cost) was
vital. Second, there was the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of the desktop
computer&mdash;the Apple, the LISA and the IBM PC (then the XT and the
AT). I'm not trying to be detailed or expansive here: I know about
the Osborne and the Kaypro, etc.</p><p>With these two developments, you could have a machine at
home, plug it into your phone line and communicate with others.
That is, if your line had modular plugs; otherwise, you either
bought a plug with four circular pins on one end and an RJ-11 on
the other, or you wired into your line at the wall and attached a
cable with an RJ-11 at the end&mdash;both were &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; acts where Ma
Bell was concerned.</p><p>In October 1981, there were 213 hosts on the Net. In February
1986, there were 2308. From 1986 to 1997, the number of hosts
doubled every year (the actual slope of the line is 2.176). But
since January 1998, as I noted above, that growth rate has
fallen.</p><p>I wouldn't worry about this.</p><p>Every technology goes from a lab to being the toy of an
in-group to being a utility. When it first becomes a utility,
people rush to buy and participate, then there is a
slackening.</p><p>But don't fret. In July 1999, Malawi, Kiribata, Eritrea and
Somalia joined the Internet. In January 1999, they were preceded by
Sao Tome, Samoa and Tuvalo. There are so few additions because
there are so few countries left unconnected.</p><p>The scale of that penetration and interconnection is quite
important. MIDS' analysis of the July 1999 data lists over 250
geographic entities. I don't use &ldquo;countries&rdquo;, because Guam,
Antarctica and the Vatican City (for example) aren't countries. But
that's still more places on the Internet than countries belonging
to the United Nations.</p><p>Doc Searls pointed out some months ago that about a third of
the Net servers were powered by Linux. As the Internet grows,
Linux's use will grow with it. There's no way that Windows (which
comes in third, after UNIX and Linux) will overtake Linux in the
Internet back rooms&mdash;nor, I imagine, in the corporate
intranets.</p><p>I'd put my money on technology by Torvalds, Gosling,
Ousterhout, Allman, Wall, et al., from companies like Transmeta,
VALS, Red Hat, Caldera; not on Wintel.</p></div></div>
