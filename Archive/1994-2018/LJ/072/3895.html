    In this episode, Mr. Hammel tells us all about Enlightenment
    0.16.1.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x27cd4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It's a simple fact of the desktop world:
artists, like all other users, want lots of screen space.
Enlightenment gives it to them, when they want it, and on their
terms. Enlightenment, usually referred to as E, allows users more
control of their desktop than just about any other window manager.
Where Window Maker and AfterStep are highly configurable, E is
downright malleable, bending and twisting to the delight of its
users.
</p><p>Window managers today share some common threads. They usually
allow some level of configuration for the Title Bar. Most have some
form of pager that allows the user to switch between virtual
desktops and, in some cases, multiple pages within each desktop.
They all support icons and most have either some form of icon box
or a way of specifying where icons should be displayed on the
desktop. All have menus for accessing applications and managing the
system as a whole.</p><p>E takes all this a bit further. Perhaps you've seen the fancy
window borders for which E gained its fame. Those are the themes
you've heard so much about, the personalization that the Windows
world calls &ldquo;skins&rdquo;. What you may not have seen are the various
ways you can jump from desktop to desktop. You can drag windows
between any page on any desktop, using the fully configurable
pagers (one pager for each desktop). You can also slide desktops
around, like giant sheets of paper, so that the top sheet only
partially obscures the one below it. None of the other window
managers has this particular feature. Some might call it fluff, but
having quick access to your desktops in a point-and-click manner is
a real joy for heavy users like me.</p><p>In this article, I will look at the configuration and use of
E from the perspective of an artist&mdash;someone who wants to define
not only his own unique look for the desktop, but also how the
desktop should work. Although key and mouse bindings are completely
configurable right from the desktop in E, I'm going to discuss
configuration using the default bindings. I'll also use the default
themes, just so you don't get too confused by my own unique
world.</p><p>I will assume you are not afraid of compiling and installing
from source-code distributions. E is a powerful system, but it's
young and still in early development. You can find fairly recent
versions of E with most recent Linux distributions, although you
may specifically have to request to have it installed.
Additionally, since E is young and in a constant state of being
updated, you will want to be familiar with building and installing
software if you plan on getting serious with E. Getting and
installing E are discussed in the article &ldquo;Enlightenment Basics&rdquo;,
which can be found in this month's &ldquo;Strictly On-Line&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x27cd710"></a>Up and Running&mdash;The First Time</h2></div></div><p>Once you have the E environment ready, you can configure your
login account to use it. The X Window System is arguably the most
configurable user environment ever created (second only to Martha
Stewart's kitchen). There are many ways you can configure your
window manager after it's running, but determining which window
manager to run can often be confusing. Big-name distributors of
Linux desperately try to hide the apparent complexities of
configuration from the user so that the desktop appears
automatically configured. Fortunately, try as they might, it's easy
to find a way around this.</p><p>The key comes in two parts:
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> (and its compatriot,
<span   class="bold"><b>xinit</b></span>) and the $HOME/.Xclients
configuration file. <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> is a
shell script with a history that goes back to the early days of X.
It's a fairly simple script, created to make using the more complex
xinit (which is used to start the X server and any initial
applications) easier for the typical user. Developers tend to build
complex systems, only to spend the rest of their lives adding front
ends and wrappers around them to simplify them for &ldquo;the typical
user&rdquo;. <span   class="bold"><b>xinit</b></span> will exist on all
Linux systems with X installed.
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> should be on all systems,
although a few distributors may remove it in favor of their own
homegrown version. If you're using one of those, dump it. There are
cases where keeping historical pieces of software available, even
if more advanced pieces become available, is advantageous. This is
one of those cases. You should be able to find both xinit and
startx under /usr/X11R6/bin.</p><p><a href="3895s1.html" target="_self">X Session</a></p><p>As long as you use startx/xinit to launch your X session, you
can make use of the .Xclients configuration file to determine what
X will start. <span   class="bold"><b>xinit</b></span> eventually
reads this file, which should be located in your $HOME directory,
starts the X server, then runs the commands specified in .Xclients.
For example, you might specify that two xterms, xclock and xcalc
all start up along with E. Such a configuration might look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xterm &amp;
xterm -bg black -fg wheat -geom 80x30\
   -font 7x13 &amp;
xclock &amp;
xcalc &amp;&lt;\n&gt; enlightenment
</pre><p>Notice that this file looks like an ordinary shell script,
but you don't have to specify the shell to use (i.e., there is no
<b  >#!/bin/sh</b> line at the top of the file) because
the standard shell, /bin/sh, is used. Each line is a command to
run, and, with the exception of the window manager line, each
command must be placed in the background using the ampersand. The
last command is normally the window manager of choice. No matter
which command is last, it shouldn't be placed in the background. If
it were, xinit (via startx) would then see that the commands file
(.Xclients) has completed. This would cause xinit to exit, bringing
your X session to an end and returning you to the text console.
</p><p>Create an Xclients file like the one in the previous example.
If X is already running, which is likely for most users who
accepted the default configurations provided by their Linux
distributions, you can still use any editor (I use
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>) and save the file to
$HOME/.Xclients. This won't affect your current X session, but when
you log out and log back in the next time, you'll get the new
configuration. Quick tip: if you get lost, rename .Xclients to
.Xclients.orig and exit your X session. The next time you start
your X session, you should be back to where you were
previously.</p><p>Now you have a simple Xclients file and you're ready to start
your X session. If you use a graphical login, you're all set. Your
new configuration will start up on your next login. If you use a
text console login and manually start your X session, just type
<b  >startx</b>. In either case, should you get lost or
confused and want a quick exit, you can type
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >BACKSPACE</b>
to kill the X server and return to either the graphical login or
text console. Quick Tip 2: remember that
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >F2</b>
should take you to a text login console, and
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >F7</b>
should take you back to your X session or graphical login.</p><p>The first time you start E, you'll see something like Figure
1. E comes with a built-in help system. The large window in the
middle of the screen is the Document Viewer, which is used to
navigate the help system. This window opens the first time you use
E and will open each subsequent time until you exit the Document
Viewer. The on-line help isn't difficult to follow, and you should
read through it thoroughly at least once. If you look closely,
you'll also see one of the informational dialogs from E. This one
states that a default menu configuration has been built for
you.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3895f1.large.jpg"><img src="3895f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Default Desktop</p></div></div>
</p><p>&ldquo;Enlightenment Basics&rdquo; described the fnlib library. That
library gives E access to some interesting fonts. The Document
Viewer, showing the on-line help, shows the default font for this
application. This is your first clue as to how E differs from other
window managers. You can create some very unusual scalable fonts
for use in E. The best way to learn how to do so is to examine the
documentation provided with the fnlib source-code
distribution.</p><p>What happens to the applications started with .Xclients? Most
will exit once the .Xclients script exits, and that happens when
you exit your window manager. But if some applications don't exit,
you can add code (just like any shell script) to .Xclients to force
those applications to exit. Remember that in an emergency, you can
kill off your X session with
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >BACKSPACE</b>,
although once you become familiar with E's menu system, you should
use the menu options provided for exiting.</p><p>Now, back to your first login. What you're looking at
requires a little explanation. First, most modern window managers
provide multiple virtual desktops. You start out with two desktops
with E's default configuration. You can tell that there are two
because you have two pagers (lower-left corner of Figure 1). Each
desktop can have multiple pages. E's default provides two pages per
desktop. The number of desktops and pages per desktop are all
configurable using graphical interfaces (i.e., you don't have to
edit configuration files manually to change these). We'll talk a
little more about configuration a little later, after we've
finished our tour of the E environment.</p><p>Across the top of Figure 1 is the drag bar. This bar is to
desktops what the Title Bar is to windows; it allows you to drag
desktops up and down. Unlike other window managers, you can
actually view and work in two desktops at the same time with
E.</p><p>In the lower-right corner of Figure 1 is the default Icon
box. It has a slider along its bottom edge, which can be used to
scroll icons left and right if there are more icons than can be
displayed in the box. Like most things in E, the size of the icons,
their arrangement (rows and columns), the number of icon boxes and
many other items can be configured using graphical configuration
utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x27ce630"></a>A Shady Desktop: Getting More Screen
Space</h2></div></div><p>Desktop users often find that their biggest problem is having
enough screen space for all the windows they need open at the same
time. Linux users are fortunate in that X was designed to make
adding virtual space possible in all sorts of ways, and E makes use
of nearly all of them.</p><p>We've already mentioned pagers, a concept that has been
around awhile. Most users have probably heard or seen them even if
they have not actually used them. E takes saving screen space a
little further by allowing you to &ldquo;roll up&rdquo; windows into their
Title Bars. The animated effect looks a little like a drawer
sliding into a chest. To roll up a window, click the middle mouse
button on the Title Bar. Click it again to roll it back out. The
animated movement of the window sliding into the Title Bar can be
toggled on or off, which is useful on memory-limited systems. When
disabled, the window simply disappears, leaving only the Title Bar
visible. This rolling in and out of windows is called
&ldquo;shading&rdquo;.</p><p>Shading works for just about any window in E. This includes
the pager windows and the icon box. The only windows that can't be
shaded are menus. Desktops don't get shaded per se, but they can be
slid up and down using the drag bar. The position and direction of
slide for drag bars is configurable.</p><p>While shading saves you space, you can manage your windows
better by grouping them together. Shading a window that's part of a
group will shade all other windows in that same group. Grouping
windows is done using the Title Bar menu&mdash;click the left mouse
button on the title to see this menu. Windows belonging to the same
Window groups can be iconified, killed, moved and shaded all at the
same time. Grouping of windows is a feature found in current
versions of WindowMaker and Afterstep, two other popular window
managers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x27ce840"></a>Touring the Desktop: User Menus</h2></div></div><p>We can now take a look at the default menu configuration. I'm
assuming you either use a three-button mouse or have your X server
configured to simulate three buttons. The latter isn't difficult to
do, but we're talking about E here, not the X server. Refer to your
X server documentation for how to simulate using a three-button
mouse.</p><p>Clicking the left mouse button over the root window (i.e.,
the background) will bring up the Enlightenment menu, which is
where you can get access to the rest of the root menus. Become
familiar with the Help system option in this menu. You'll be
referring back to it on a regular basis.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3895f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Default Enlightenment Menu
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3895f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Settings Menu
</p></div></div><p>Clicking the right mouse button over the root window will
open the Settings menu. This is where you want to be in order to
configure some aspects of E. Options include window focus and
auto-raise, desktop backgrounds, and special effects like animated
shading of windows and window sliding. The last option causes
windows to slide in from one edge of the screen when you change to
the page and desktop where they live. Animation options should be
turned off on low-end systems and ones with limited memory, to
improve overall performance.</p><p>Title bars have menus which are opened with right mouse
clicks in the title area. This menu allows you to force windows to
be &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;, which means they are visible no matter what page or
desktop is in focus. Here, too, you can set a given window's Window
Group, stacking order and border style. You can also use this menu
to close windows of applications which may be misbehaving.</p><p>Menus are available for many other E features. The icon box's
menu can be opened with the right mouse button clicked along its
edges or inside the box. One option in this menu is the Iconbox
Settings window. Here you'll find many options, including changing
the box's orientation (horizontal or vertical), automatic resizing
of the icon box, showing or hiding the icon names and backgrounds,
and whether or not to use a transparent background in the
box.</p><p>The pagers have two menus which are also opened with right
mouse clicks. Since pagers are just like any other application,
their Title Bars (which are just as likely to be along a side as
along the top of the pager window) have a menu like any other
application's window. This differs from the pager's menu, opened
with a right mouse click inside the pager itself. This menu offers
you the option of setting high or low-quality display of windows
and images in the pager, as well as a Pager Settings window. This
window allows you to set a few pager-specific options. If you're on
a low-end system, or one with limited memory (like a laptop), you
will want to disable the continuous screen scan option in this
window.</p><p>Finally, the drag bar has a small menu which allows you to
jump directly to windows in other desktops. A middle mouse-button
click on the drag bar will show titles of all windows in all
desktops. Selecting a title will jump you to that window. If the
window is in the current desktop page but hidden by other windows,
it will raise that window to the top of all windows. If you
left-click on the drag bar and drag down, you can expose
lower-layer desktops. A window can be dragged between desktops
(onto the same relative page) in this manner. For example, if the
window is in the currently visible desktop and you pull the drag
bar down a little to expose the next higher level desktop, you can
drag the window's title bar into the next higher level desktop.
When you release the mouse button, the window's desktop is moved.
Again, E provides many different methods for accomplishing the same
task. Moving windows between desktops can also be done using
various menu options.</p><p>The drag bar is just another way of doing what the pagers do,
but without taking up any extra screen space. You can disable the
pagers completely and just use the drag bar to move around your
desktops. The drag bar is long and thin&mdash;E works hard to save
screen space&mdash;and can be configured so it sits along any edge of
the display.</p><p>By default, E configures menus to be opened using an animated
display. On slower systems or systems with limited memory, it is
better to disable this feature using the Settings menu (right-click
in root window).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x2bc71c8"></a>Touring the Desktop: Pagers</h2></div></div><p>Virtual screen space gives you added room to keep windows
open. In essence, they are an alternative to iconizing windows.
Icons are nice, but without meaningful icons to represent the real
window's application, icons can be more confusing than
helpful.</p><p>Pagers get around this ambiguity by simply leaving the
windows open. You jump to and fro between virtual desktops with
multiple pages. Think of each desktop as a desk in a different cube
with multiple drawers. Each drawer would be a page in the desktop.
The main difference is that it's easier to work on the virtual
desktops than it is to swap papers to and from the desk and
drawers.</p><p>E's pagers are fairly sophisticated, compared to pagers for
other window managers. First, the background image used on a
desktop can be displayed in each page of the pager, making it
easier to delineate the pages. Each window in a pager is a
miniature version of the real one, complete with window borders,
window contents and images. The miniaturized windows in the pager
can be zoomed when the mouse is over them, although for things like
ordinary xterms, this isn't very helpful. What is useful is having
the window title displayed when the mouse is over a window in the
pager. This allows you to identify any window in any page of any
desktop instantly&mdash;and a simple middle mouse button click on that
window in its pager will jump you right to the window.</p><p>Having different backgrounds for each desktop is also
supported. Figure 4 shows a desktop configured with 3 pagers along
the right side, each with a different desktop background image and
a 2x2 page configuration. A Netscape image and multicolored sticky
notes are visible in various pages.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3895f4.large.jpg"><img src="3895f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Example of Multiple
Pagers</p></div></div>
</p><p>This example shows a modified configuration using a theme
different from the default, personalized backgrounds and pagers
with different configurations. Compare Figure 1 with Figure 4, and
you'll see just how varied the E environment can look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x2bc7640"></a>Epplets</h2></div></div><p>One of the newer features of E is its ability to support
small programs, called epplets, to perform simple functions. The
epplets are usually small C programs, but you can also create small
scripts run by eesh, the Enlightenment shell. Epplets can be
stand-alone programs which have their own user interface, or they
can let E handle the user interface for them&mdash;a sort of embedded
application.</p><p>Currently, there are only a few small epplets, provided
mostly by loyal E enthusiasts. E itself comes with a few scripts,
but no epplets. None of the epplets do anything overly interesting,
although it's highly likely that functions like automatic
connection to the Internet will be provided in the future using
epplets. The most interesting of the epplets is probably
<span   class="bold"><b>gkrellm</b></span>, an all-in-one epplet that
displays system performance, time and other useful information. You
can expect that future extensibility of E will come in the form of
expanded support for epplets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x2bc77f8"></a>Personalizing the Desktop</h2></div></div><p>After all this, why should you consider E? In a nutshell--
configurability. E offers you the most options to making the
desktop yours&mdash;your style, your feel, your world. You live on
computers day in and day out. Why shouldn't it be a more personal
place?</p><p>E has a considerable amount of graphical configuration
support. In fact, nearly all features of E are configurable using
simple graphical interfaces that you can access via the Settings
menu or from feature-specific menus. The only parts of E that
require manual intervention are adding menu options to the root
menus and developing themes.</p><p>The Settings menu allows you to change the way the window
manager works in many ways: opaque vs. transparent window moves,
autofocus and autoraise for windows, desktop, tooltip and audio
settings, and even a few special effects. It's important to scan
through these settings, especially if you're running on a
memory-limited laptop. Enlightenment is designed to allow you to
add more flash to your desktop if your system has the CPU and
memory to deal with it. But if it can't, E also allows you to
disable some of the resource hogs.</p><p>Changing the root menus is fairly easy. Just edit the
file.menu and/or user_apps.menu files under your
$HOME/.enlightenment directory, which was created the first time
you started E. You can add new submenus for the root menus in this
way. The file.menu file corresponds to the User Menus menu (opened
with a left mouse click on the root window). The user_apps.menu
displays as the User Applications List menu, an option from the
&ldquo;User Menus&rdquo; menu.</p><p>E checks the entries in these menu files to see if the
program associated with a menu option can be found. If the program
can't be found, then that entry won't be displayed in the menu. You
can use fully qualified path names for programs. If the application
is in a directory listed in your PATH environment variable, you
just need to specify the program name.</p><p>Changing menus lets you have quick access to starting
applications. How do you force an application to always start on a
particular desktop page? E can remember open applications, but you
have to specify manually which windows to reopen the next time you
start an X session. To do this, hold down the
<b  >ALT</b> key while you right-click in a window; a
menu will open. Select the &ldquo;Remember...&rdquo; option, and in the
dialog that opens, select the options you want E to remember for
this application. The next time you start E, it will start the
application with the parameters you specified.</p><p>Note that this differs from how we started X the first time,
using the .Xclients file. That file is used by xinit to start
applications every time you start an X session&mdash;Enlightenment
doesn't know anything about those applications. The
<b  >ALT</b>-right mouse click method just mentioned
tells Enlightenment to restart an application after E is started.
The choice here is whether to allow xinit or E to start your
applications. To make life easier, the only line you want in your
.Xclients file is the command to start Enlightenment; then, use E
to manage the starting of any other applications.</p><p>Dragging windows can have many effects. Dragging a window
from a pager over the root window will drop that window onto the
current page and desktop. You can drag windows from the pager into
the icon box to iconize the window without actually going to the
desktop the window lives in. The icon box can be resized by holding
down the <b  >ALT</b> key and clicking the middle mouse
button&mdash;not intuitive, but easy enough once you know what to
do.</p><p>The background for any desktop can be set using the &ldquo;Desktop
Background Settings...&rdquo; option in the Settings menu. User's
backgrounds in just about any format (for example, TIFF, JPEG and
PNG as long as your version of imlib was built to support these)
can be copied to ~/.enlightenment/backgrounds. Changes to this
directory will be recognized only if you restart E; however, this
is easy to do using the &ldquo;User Menus&rdquo; menu.</p><p>How would someone go about figuring out how to change the
themes? How do you find out how to create stylized buttons, Title
Bars and so forth? This is the current limitation in E (and,
actually, in many other Linux desktops). Simple themes can specify
background images for windows and desktops, and images to use for
icons. E allows more sophisticated control of the display by
allowing you to specify window borders, title bars, edges, corners
and various other bits and pieces. The bad news is there isn't yet
any documentation anywhere that accurately describes how to do
this. The good news is that whenever something minimal is provided
by the developers, I'll be able to turn that into something more
detailed for you.</p><p>Despite the lack of information on creating your own themes,
many prepackaged themes are available for E from the official site
for Linux themes: Themes.org. This site has sections devoted to the
various window managers which support some form of themed
environments. I looked through a number of the user-contributed
themes for E that you can find here, but didn't find any that were
visually more appealing than the BlueSteel theme provided in the
default installation of E. Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the
user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x2bc7d78"></a>Performance Issues</h2></div></div><p>Most of my research for this article and others in this
series has been done on two systems: a Pentium II 400MHz box with
256MB of memory and an IBM ThinkPad i1410 (Celeron 200MHz) with
32MB of memory. By using two significantly different systems, I was
able to compare some visible performance differences for the
various window managers.</p><p>Performance on the Thinkpad was reasonable, even with
animations turned on. The slide-show change to different desktops
is a little jumpy, but not really slow. Translucent moves&mdash;windows
appear partially transparent when being dragged around the
desktop&mdash;were extremely slow, and shaded moves were nearly
unusable. Use Shaded moves only if you plan on shading the windows
first or have a fast CPU. Technical moves are fairly interesting
visually and quite fast, since they draw only the boundaries of the
windows. Box moves aren't as visually stimulating, but are quite
fast. Box and Technical moves are the options of choice for slower,
memory-limited systems.</p><p>Another thing to look at for performance issues is the Imlib
Configuration tool. By default, you can get to this from the User
Menus--&gt;User Application List--&gt; Imlib Settings option (left
mouse click in the root window). From here, you can set the color
quality of the window rendering, and the amount of cache to use for
images and pixmaps. The Color Correction page is quite interesting,
although its effect is not obvious unless you have high-quality
background images. On lower-end systems, try reducing the Image
Cache, Pixmap Cache and Shared Memory sizes to their lowest
settings. Also, disable the High Quality mode for 15/16bpp systems.
Many laptops are likely to run in 15/16bpp, so you'll want the High
Quality mode disabled on these systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d5580.0x2bc7f30"></a>In the End...</h2></div></div><p>E is still in development, so it may possibly cause system
lockups. I tried to access the Audio features from the Settings
Menu, even though I had turned off the sound options during
compilation, and this caused a segmentation fault. Interestingly
enough, E caught this problem and offered me the option of
restarting or continuing. Although the fault is a problem, it
handled it gracefully.</p><p>E is cool and more than likely has a very interesting future
to come. It's fairly stable&mdash;I had only two lockups in all my
testing on both systems&mdash;but lacks end-user information to make
serious use of all its features. It comes with one of the most
interesting default interfaces available. Many people are
recognizing the potential of E. It works happily in both the GNOME
and KDE environments.</p><p>E is also resource-intensive&mdash;it can chew up memory fairly
quickly. Because it's still in development, installation can be a
pain for the inexperienced user. You need to understand how to
build and install multiple software packages just to get it running
properly. Configuration of menus can be complex and requires manual
editing. Stylized, themed interfaces are possible, but it's not yet
clear how to create these. There isn't any real documentation that
begins to explain the process.</p><p>My purpose here was to talk about what the desktop
environment can be to end users&mdash;distinctively personalized. E
offers the potential for this more than any other window manager,
but it's a long way from the simplicity that typical desktop users
expect. Its complexity notwithstanding, if you've got the
determination to experiment and research the default configurations
on your own, you may find that E will have its place in your
world.</p><p><a href="3895s1.html" target="_self">X Session Technical
