    Everything you need to know to make those Internet and

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2a580.0xc224a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have a fairly complicated home network
that uses many of the different features of Linux. While my network
setup is probably more complicated than what you'll ever need in
your home, you may find that you want to use some of the same
features. In this article, I'll describe how my computers are
physically connected, discuss how I want my network to work, and
then explain how I used various aspects of Linux to accomplish
those goals.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2a580.0xc225b0"></a>The Physical Layer</h2></div></div><p>I have three desktop computers and a laptop, with Internet
access provided by a cable modem and an ISDN line. One of the
desktop computers runs Linux and handles communication between the
Internet and the internal network.</p><p>The cable modem is an external device that converts the cable
signal into an Ethernet signal. I also use an external ISDN modem
that works the same way. Each of these is connected to a separate
Ethernet card in my central Linux system.</p><p>The three desktop computers are connected to each other using
Ethernet with a hub. The laptop, however, doesn't have Ethernet, so
it connects to my central Linux system using a cable between the
parallel ports.</p><p>So, the central computer has three Ethernet cards: one for
the cable modem, one for the ISDN modem, and one for the hub
connecting to the other machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2a580.0xc227c0"></a>How It Should Work</h2></div></div><p>First, let me explain how my Internet connections work. The
cable modem provides a single dynamic IP address and a fast
connection to the general Internet. The ISDN line provided by my
company connects to its internal network, and provides a 16 IP
address subnet for the ISDN line.</p><p>I want all my computers to communicate with each other, my
company's intranet and the general Internet. I want to use the IP
addresses that come with the ISDN line for my internal
network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2a580.0xc22920"></a>Subnets and Routing</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I did was partition my network into subnets.
Forget anything you've heard about different classes of IP
addresses; they're not relevant for home networking. The issue here
is subnetting. The idea is that you have a block of contiguous IP
addresses, and you want to split them into separate smaller blocks.
The only restriction is that the number of addresses on each block
must be a power of two.</p><p>When subnetting, the first address of each block is called
the &ldquo;network&rdquo; address. Don't use it for anything. The last
address of the block is the &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; address. This, also, is
not used for any particular machine. The &ldquo;netmask&rdquo; is
255.255.255.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is
256 minus the number of addresses in the subnet.</p><p>IP routing is handled as either a network or on an
address-by-address basis. For a network, you specify the network
address and the netmask instead of just a single IP number. In
either case, you have to tell it how to get to that address. If the
machines are on a directly connected network, you can just specify
a network interface; otherwise, you have to give it the address of
another machine that will do forwarding for you.</p><p>For my network, I assigned the 16 IP addresses that came with
my ISDN modem as follows: 4 for a subnet connecting the ISDN modem
and my main Linux system, 4 for the PLIP subnet connecting my
laptop and 8 for the Ethernet connecting my desktop systems. The
cable modem provides a single IP address for the Ethernet interface
it connects to, while the ISDN modem acts like a router with its
own IP address.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2a580.0xc22be0"></a>How It All Works</h2></div></div><p>I completely rewrote my startup scripts for initializing my
network. Probably the best way to understand my network is to step
through the initialization script for my main Linux system and
explain what it does. Like most systems, my startup scripts are
written for /bin/sh (which is actually bash, but I don't use any
fancy bash features).</p><p>Since the tools for Linux 2.2 are different from those in
Linux 2.0, the scripts check which version I'm running, allowing me
to use whichever kernel I choose to boot.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Determine kernel version
KVERSION=`/usr/bin/awk '{printf("%3.3s\n,$3)}'\
/proc/version`
</pre><p>Now I go through and set up each of the network interfaces.
The loopback device is there for making network connections to my
own machine. Every Linux system should already have this
configured.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Attach the loopback device.
/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0 lo
</pre>


I built all the Ethernet drivers as modules. This allows me easy
control over which interface is eth0, as opposed to eth1. You will
notice I use options to specify the I/O address of my NE2000 card.
This is because I have the unusual combination of an ISA and a PCI
NE2000 card, and they use separate drivers.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up the cable modem,
:echo setting up eth0
modprobe ne io=0x300,1,1,1
</pre>


The cable modem uses DHCP to determine its IP address, and there's
a different version of the DHCP client daemon for 2.2.
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "starting dhcpcd"
[ $KVERSION = "2.0" ] &amp;&amp; {
        /sbin/dhcpcd.old -r eth0
} || {
        /sbin/dhcpcd eth0
}
echo "
</pre>


The second Ethernet card is connected to the ISDN modem. The ISDN
modem acts like a router, so it has its own IP address (.209). I
add a route for the subnet to use eth1, and I add another route for
my employer's network to be gatewayed through the ISDN line.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up the ISDN line
echo setting up eth1
modprobe ne2k-pci
ifconfig eth1 inet 172.25.5.210 netmask 255.255.255.252 \ broadcast 172.25.5.211
route add -net 172.25.5.208 netmask 255.255.255.252 eth1
route add -net 168.159.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0\
gw 172.25.5.209
</pre>


The third Ethernet interface is for my internal network.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up the LAN
echo setting up eth2
modprobe tulip options=11
ifconfig eth2 inet 172.25.5.217 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 172.25.5.223
route add -net 172.25.5.216 netmask\
255.255.255.248 eth2
</pre>


For my laptop, setting up PLIP is just like setting up another
Ethernet port. Because I have a separate parallel port with a
printer attached, I use modules for both PLIP and LP and specify
options to <span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span> so it gets the
right port for each one.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up PLIP
# see
# http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/PLIP.html
echo setting up plip0
[ $KVERSION = "2.2" ] &amp;&amp; {
        modprobe lp parport=1
        echo 7 &gt; /proc/parport/0/irq
        modprobe plip parport=0
} || {
        modprobe lp io=0x378
        modprobe plip io=0x3bc irq=7
}
/sbin/ifconfig plip0 172.25.5.213 netmask \
255.255.255.252 pointopoint 172.25.5.214 up
/sbin/route  add -net 172.25.5.212 netmask \
255.255.255.252 dev plip0
</pre>


We will use IP Masquerade to allow us to share the single IP
address provided by the cable modem, so we want to load the modules
to provide support for masquerading protocols needing special help.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Load IP Masquerade modules
# Note that some of these only exist for 2.2
# kernels
modprobe ip_masq_ftp
modprobe ip_masq_irc
modprobe ip_masq_raudio
modprobe ip_masq_cuseeme
[ $KVERSION = "2.2" ] &amp;&amp; {
        modprobe ip_masq_vdolive.o
        modprobe ip_masq_quake.o
}
</pre>


Now for the masquerading, firewalling and such. All of this changed
in the 2.2 kernel, but the ideas are the same. First, we set up our
forwarding rules. These tell Linux what to do when it receives an
IP packet from one machine that is destined for another. Anything
from the internal machines destined for the Internet should be
masqueraded. We also need to allow forwarding of packets between
the different interfaces. What we don't want is to allow
connections from the general Internet to be forwarded or
masqueraded&mdash;coming in from the cable modem should be addressed to
the IP number assigned for that interface. Hence, my default policy
is to forward, and I have special rules to masquerade packets
destined to go out the cable modem or come in from the cable modem.
</p><p>Note that the order of the forwarding rules is important. The
kernel must see the rules for masquerading before the rule for
denying forwarding on the interface.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up IP Masquerading
# This has to be done carefully to only masquerade
# packets that originate from my network. Otherwise,
# someone on the outside could route through my
# system to hide their identity
echo Setting up IP Masquerade
[ $KVERSION = "2.2" ] &amp;&amp; {
        echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        ipchains -P forward ACCEPT
        ipchains -A forward -i eth0 -s \
172.25.5.216/255.255.255.248 -j
        MASQ
        ipchains -A forward -i eth0 -s \
172.25.5.212/255.255.255.252 -j
        MASQ
        ipchains -A forward -i eth0 -j DENY
} || {
        /sbin/ipfwadm -F -p accept
        /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -S \
172.25.5.216/255.255.255.248 -D 0.0.0.0/0 -W
eth0
        /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -S \
172.25.5.212/255.255.255.252 -D 0.0.0.0/0 -W \
eth0
        /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a deny -W eth0
}
</pre><p>Now, I like to run X on several machines, connecting to them
from accounts on remote Internet hosts. The X server accepts
connections on port 6000+<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> is the number following the colon in the
DISPLAY variable. Hence, I want to forward connections to port 6001
to port 6000 on an internal machine, doing a sort of reverse IP
masquerade. With 2.2, I use port forwarding. With 2.0, I use a
user-space daemon, since port forwarding isn't part of the standard
2.0 kernel. Note this is insecure, since the internal machine
thinks all the forwarded connections are coming from my other Linux
box.
</p><p><a href="3575l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>This gets a bit complicated, because the normal way of doing
port forwarding requires you to specify the IP address the packet
was addressed to. Since my IP address is dynamically assigned, I
wanted to keep my rules independent of my IP address. Hence, I do a
two-step process using &ldquo;firewall marking&rdquo;. I create a marking
rule that assigns a numbered mark to any incoming packet for port
6001, and then I do port forwarding based on that mark. (See
Listing 1.)</p><p><a href="3575l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The last step is adding some firewall rules (see Listing 2)
to block out the general Internet connections I don't want. For
example, I run Sendmail, but only for sending mail, as I receive
mail elsewhere. Instead of keeping up on all the security issues
concerning Sendmail, I just block any attempts to connect to it
from outside. You can use <b  >DENY</b> or
<b  >REJECT</b>. The difference is that
<b  >REJECT</b> will send back a packet saying
&ldquo;connection refused&rdquo;, while <b  >DENY</b> will totally
ignore the connection attempt.</p><p>Now we have a problem with the ISDN modem, because when it
sends packets out for my various machines, it thinks they're all on
one big subnet. It doesn't realize it needs to send everything to
my central Linux system, which will then route things. Since I
didn't want to bother the people who configured the modem, I
instead used bridging to solve the problem. Bridging is somewhat
like routing, but at a different level. Routing uses IP addresses;
bridging uses Ethernet addresses. When bridging is turned on, Linux
figures out the Ethernet addresses of all the systems on each
interface, and if it sees a packet addressed to a machine on a
different interface from that machine, it retransmits the packet on
the right interface. What is important is that a bridge
transparently connects Ethernet segments. It works at the Ethernet
level, so any IP-level stuff (such as firewalling, masquerading and
subnetting) is completely bypassed. You don't even have to assign
IP addresses to the interfaces when bridging. In order for it to
work, you have to put the interfaces into &ldquo;promiscuous&rdquo; mode, so
they will listen for Ethernet packets which aren't addressed to
them.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Set up bridging so that incoming ISDN packets
# that don't know that
# I'm acting as a router will be intercepted and
# passed on
ifconfig eth1 promisc
ifconfig eth2 promisc
brcfg -ena
</pre><p><a href="3575l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>
</p><p>Bridging works at the Ethernet level, so PLIP, which is an
IP-level interface, can't be a part of a bridge. But, I still want
to do the same thing for my laptop. The solution is to use proxy
ARP (see Listing 3). The idea is to use the &ldquo;address resolution
protocol&rdquo;, which maps between IP addresses and Ethernet addresses,
to tell the ISDN modem my Linux gateway is supposed to receive
packets for the IP number I've assigned to my laptop. Think of ARP
as the glue that connects Ethernet to IP networking.</p><p>For the client systems, I configure their network interfaces
the same way I configured the corresponding interface above, only
changing the IP address. I then add a route for the subnet and set
the default route to be my Linux box. It also works fine if the
client is running MacOS or Windows. Here's an example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Configure network interface and routes
ifconfig eth0 inet 172.25.5.218 netmask \&lt;\n&gt;
255.255.255.248 broadcast 172.25.5.223
route add -net 172.25.5.216 netmask \&lt;\n&gt;
255.255.255.248 eth0
route add default gw 172.25.5.217
</pre><p>Of course, I also had to recompile my kernel, explicitly
enabling every feature I used. Some of them are flagged as
&ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, but they have been completely stable in my
experience (although you do need to tell the kernel to allow
&ldquo;experimental&rdquo; features during configuration). The only
networking kernel patch I've used is an update of the version of
the Tulip card driver, because my card is rather strange.
</p><p>Be careful, though: even people who really know what they're
doing can make mistakes. If you find any security holes in my
network, please let <i  >Linux Journal</i> know, so
others won't make the same mistake.</p><p></p></div></div>
