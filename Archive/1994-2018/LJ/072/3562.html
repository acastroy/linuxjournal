good within a narrow specialty. You can use the book intensively
and learn much from it, in which case it is worth what you pay for
it. If you are only casually interested in the subject, the book
isn't worth the price of admission and you should look for
something else. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Practical Guide to SNMPv3 and Network
Management</em></span> is one of those books.</p><p>Engineering students working on SNMP (simple network
management protocol) and engineers designing and implementing SNMP
entities (devices and network management software) will benefit the
most from this book. If you are a network administrator who uses
SNMP engines but you don't &ldquo;get under the hood&rdquo; very often, then
this book is probably overkill. It is aimed specifically at SNMP
version 3, with historical references to older versions of SNMP. If
you need a more general introduction to SNMP, the classic one is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Simple Book</em></span> by Marshall T. Rose, now in
its second edition.</p><p>The book assumes a cursory familiarity with SNMP, but does
not require any knowledge of the underlying protocols (UDP, IPX,
etc.). There is an introduction to SNMP, so if you have never dealt
with versions of SNMP prior to 3, it will bring you up to speed
with a historical perspective. Since any network of reasonable size
will have a mixed bag of SNMP versions on it, this historical
perspective is essential.</p><p>The book builds on some basic blocks, such as a detailed
description of the character set allowed for the data type
<b  >DisplayString</b>. There is a table of control
characters indicating what they do. These basic building blocks may
be tedious to read about, but they are essential if you want to
avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>Much of the text is accompanied by pseudo-code, written in
the author's own pseudo-code language. The language is a bit
disconcerting to start with, but easy enough to learn. The
pseudo-code examples are detailed, well-commented and occasionally
extend across multiple pages. The pseudo-code examples should port
readily to C.</p><p>The author divides SNMP into three areas. First is the SNMP
protocol itself. This consists of the messages SNMP uses, their
formats and how SNMP entities interchange them. Second is the
Structure of Management Information (SMI), a set of rules for
ordering information on a managed device. Third is the structured
collection of information on a managed device or a management
information base (MIB).</p><p>After the introduction and a chapter on the basics, the
author takes us on a tour of MIB-II, as modified by experience, if
not formal standards. We are presented with an item-by-item list of
the entries in MIB-II. However, the author also gives his own
opinions from time to time. I'm glad to have the benefit of
Zeltserman's 16 years of experience building networks and network
devices.</p><p>Sometimes, however, the author's experience gets in the way.
MIB-II is divided into several groups, one of which is the EGP
group. He simply informs us that it isn't used any more, so he
doesn't describe it. Given the thorough detail in most of the book,
that terse statement is disconcerting. It's okay for folks
implementing a brand-new SNMP entity. But for those readers who
might have to deal with an older entity, it would be nice to know
why the EGP group is no longer used. Even better would be to
document it and say why it isn't used any more, leaving the
decision to the reader. Any serious reader of this book has access
to other literature and especially to the RFCs, so this is
certainly a deficiency the reader could quickly remedy, if need
be.</p><p>The next chapter introduces the architecture of the SMNPv3
framework. It introduces some concepts new to SNMPv3, particularly
the modularity of the framework, and new security and
administration features.</p><p>One portion of SNMPv3 engines consists of applications for
such things as generating and responding to commands and
notifications (formerly traps). This is the subject of Chapter
5.</p><p>Chapter 6 begins coverage of security, which SNMPv1 veterans
will find changed and considerably enlarged. Authentication and the
data encryption algorithm are discussed.</p><p>Chapter 7 covers view-based access control. This is a
security technique that allows the administrator to determine which
users may see and modify certain views into an MIB.</p><p>Chapter 8 deals with coexistence. This is the problem of
translating from older versions of SNMP to SNMPv3. This becomes
problematic either when a proxy may have to translate, or when an
entity supports multiple versions of SNMP.</p><p>RMON2 is covered in Chapter 9. Where previous versions of
RMON dealt only with the physical address (MAC address for
Ethernet), RMON2 goes to higher-level protocols and lets you
analyze traffic for specific protocols.</p><p>A shortcoming common to many technical books is the failure
to explore the implications of the subject for personal privacy, a
right rapidly vanishing from the Internet. Because RMON2 can look
at an individual computer's application layer network traffic, it
has clear implications for personal privacy at home and work. This,
in turn, brings up ethical questions, such as: do network
administrators want to provide proof that Joe is looking at porn
web sites&mdash;or Dilbert&mdash;on company time? Is it our business that Sue
is using e-mail to set up an assignation with a man not her
husband? Yet, the author provides no warning to that effect.</p><p>The final chapter describes a number of Cisco private MIBs.
Cisco has done an excellent job of documenting their private MIBs,
and has a large share of the market, so the Cisco private MIBs are
an excellent choice. Still, a comparable HP MIB or two, say, would
have made an interesting comparison. The gist of the chapter
suggests how the network manager can take advantage of private
MIBs.</p><p>One private MIB the author explores is the Ping MIB, which
like the TCP/IP networking utility of the same name, lets you
measure instantaneous network response times. This has clear
implications for network tuning. This and other private MIBs may
lead one to speculate that beneath the dull exteriors of some Cisco
boxes beats the heart of a penguin.</p><p>The book has an index. It appears to list every object
described in the book, which makes it an excellent reference work.
However, some concepts are missing, and that makes the book harder
to use as a high-level reference work.</p><p>The bottom line: if you are serious about SNMPv3, get this
book.</p></div></div>
