secrecy-shrouded startup Transmeta Corporation, he couldn't tell
anyone what he was working on. Now, the wraps are off a
revolutionary new idea: a chip that combines the low power of a
RISC chip with the software versatility of an x86 processor. This
combination enables a new class of lighter, longer-lasting mobile
devices with PC compatibility, and yes, some of these devices run
Linux. The new chip (see Figure 1), dubbed Crusoe after the famous
traveler, achieves this combination of features without any RISC or
x86 hardware. Instead, it runs so-called code-morphing software on
VLIW (very long instruction word) hardware to execute standard PC
software. This unique combination delivers the low cost, low power
and software compatibility needed in a mobile PC or a portable web
pad.

Figure 2. Dave Ditzel
</p></div></div><p>Dave Ditzel (see Figure 2), a former Bell Labs and Sun CPU
architect, founded Transmeta in 1995 to pursue a novel approach to
x86 microprocessor design. Whereas Intel and AMD take power-hungry
desktop PC processors and cripple them to fit into a notebook PC,
Transmeta decided to design a new mobile x86 processor from the
ground up. As a result, the company's Crusoe chips dissipate as
little as one-fifth the power of Intel's Mobile Pentium III. To
minimize power, Crusoe uses a simple yet powerful VLIW architecture
that requires far fewer transistors than Pentium III or AMD's
Athlon. These traditional chips execute several instructions at
once to improve performance. Standard x86 programs, however, assume
the processor executes one instruction at a time. Therefore, a huge
portion of a Pentium III or Athlon chip is devoted to checking and
arranging instructions so they can be safely executed
together.</p><p>A VLIW design, such as Crusoe, avoids this overhead. Each
Crusoe instruction contains the equivalent of four x86
instructions, all prearranged for optimum execution. With no
checking or reordering logic, the processor can execute all four
instructions at once and immediately begin the next set of four
instructions. As a result, the processing logic in Crusoe requires
75% fewer transistors than in Pentium III. This difference provides
several advantages. Each transistor on a chip consumes electricity;
with far fewer transistors, Crusoe needs less power to operate. The
missing transistors also make Crusoe less expensive to build than a
Pentium III. The simpler chip requires less time to design and is
easier to test&mdash;important issues for a small company such as
Transmeta.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a8580.0x21a0b30"></a>Code-Morphing Delivers Compatibility</h2></div></div><p>Alone, a VLIW chip is incapable of running programs designed
for an x86 processor. But the Crusoe chips are paired with
Transmeta's patented code-morphing software (CMS), which converts
x86 programs into VLIW instructions that the chips can understand.
Although Transmeta is a chip company, developing this software was
a more daunting task than developing the chip itself.</p><p>The CMS, which Torvalds helped to develop, analyzes an x86
program and feeds the corresponding VLIW instructions to the
processor. This translation is done on the fly and is invisible to
the user. The CMS translates only those portions of the program
that are in use; for example, when executing Microsoft Word, the
&ldquo;mail merge&rdquo; module is not translated unless it is
invoked.</p><p>Translated code blocks are saved in a translation cache; on
subsequent iterations, no retranslation is needed. Since programs
often execute the same loops and subroutines over and over, the
translation cache is very effective. But the CMS has the odd
property that it executes a program relatively slowly to start, but
faster over time. Translations are not saved when the user quits an
application, so the learning process starts anew each time the
application is launched. The overhead of code morphing reduces the
raw performance of the VLIW engine, but over time, this overhead is
amortized across many iterations of frequently used code blocks.
Transmeta's VP of Product Development, Doug Laird, claims that the
667MHz Crusoe chip will match the performance of a 500MHz Pentium
III, although the company has not released benchmark data to
support this claim.</p><p>Many popular PC benchmarks use a particular feature of an
application very briefly before moving on, reducing the advantage
of the translation cache. This problem makes measuring the
performance of the Crusoe chip difficult. Real users, in contrast,
typically use the same features again and again. For Transmeta to
compete well against Intel, end users must perceive Crusoe to be
just as fast as Pentium III.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a8580.0x21a0d40"></a>Hardware and Software Designed Together</h2></div></div><p>Processor designers and software designers typically work for
different companies. If they do work at the same company, they
rarely deign to speak to one another. At Transmeta, these engineers
work hand in hand. The unique combination of hardware and
code-morphing software allows them to solve problems in ways no
other company can.</p><p>This is because the CMS is the only code that uses Crusoe's
VLIW instructions; all other software for the chip is written in
x86 code. Therefore, the processor designers are freed from the
burden of maintaining compatibility; in fact, the first two
Transmeta chips are not even compatible with each other! Each uses
its own version of the CMS, and both are fully compatible with all
x86 programs through code morphing. If the hardware team wants to
give the chip a feature that improves performance or reduces cost,
they need only clear it with their compatriots in CMS land, and the
change can be made. Conversely, a bug in the hardware design can
often be solved by telling the CMS &ldquo;don't do that&rdquo;, avoiding a
costly and time-consuming redesign of the chip.</p><p>The biggest fear of an Intel CPU engineer is that their
design will have a bug that prevents some application from running
correctly. The infamous Pentium floating-point bug cost the company
hundreds of millions of dollars in 1995. In contrast, if the CMS
doesn't execute an x86 application correctly, the CMS can usually
be patched and reissued within a matter of days. Crusoe may be the
first microprocessor to be upgraded in the field. CMS engineers
also ask for and receive hardware changes that accelerate x86
execution. Previous attempts to implement x86 compatibility in
software, such as Sun's WABI (x86 on SPARC) and Digital's FX!32
(x86 on Alpha), failed because they didn't offer the right
combination of 100% compatibility and competitive performance.
Neither SPARC nor Alpha offers any support for x86 in hardware,
whereas the Crusoe chips include small but important circuits that
speed the code-morphing software beyond what previous efforts
achieved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a8580.0x21a0ef8"></a>Competing in Mobile PCs</h2></div></div><p>With its low power and x86 compatibility, Crusoe is an
obvious fit for a notebook PC. The processor runs Microsoft Windows
and standard PC software, just like a system that uses an Intel or
AMD processor. Its low power extends battery life and reduces the
amount of heat the processor gives off. With a cooler chip,
notebook makers can take out fans and heat sinks that add weight,
burn power and make noise. Not satisfied with the inherent benefits
of its VLIW design, Transmeta developed its LongRun technology to
further trim Crusoe's power consumption. During operation, the CMS
monitors the workload of the processor and dynamically adjusts its
clock speed to match. Unlike other chips, Crusoe can reduce its
voltage as well as its clock speed; because CMOS power equals
cv&lt;+&gt;2&lt;+&gt;f, at 50% workload the chip needs less than
20% of its peak power.</p><p>LongRun was announced the day after Intel's SpeedStep
technology, which also changes clock speed and voltage in mobile
systems. SpeedStep processors go faster when the notebook PC is
plugged into the wall, but SpeedStep has no effect in battery mode.
In contrast, LongRun conserves power, extending battery life when a
notebook user is on the go. The low power of Crusoe will extend the
battery life of traditional notebook PCs, but only by 30% or so in
most situations. That's because the CPU typically consumes about a
quarter of the battery's output, with most of the rest used by the
display backlight, hard drive and CD-ROM drive. Transmeta likes to
focus on applications, such as DVD, that are more CPU-intensive and
therefore have a bigger advantage on Crusoe. But simply adding
Crusoe to today's notebook PCs will not result in an eight-hour
battery life.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a8580.0x21a1058"></a>Creating a New Class of Devices</h2></div></div><p>Crusoe's power advantage is more critical in the emerging
market for portable web devices. In a wireless web pad with no
drives (see Figure 3), the CPU is a large part of the power budget.
Intel suggests its Celeron processor for these devices, but Celeron
burns too much power for extended battery life. Intel's StrongArm
chip uses even less power than Crusoe, but doesn't offer x86
compatibility.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3942f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Prototype Web Pad Using Crusoe Chip
</p></div></div><p>Why is x86 compatibility important? After all, these devices
don't run Windows or Windows software; they use an embedded
operating system, in some cases the new Mobile Linux, and a browser
that has been compiled specifically for the internal
processor.</p><p>Transmeta points out that many browser plug-ins are written
in x86 code. To get the full web experience, a web pad must be able
to download and execute new plug-ins. Without these plug-ins, some
web pages simply won't work. To offer the same experience for a
StrongArm web pad, a system vendor would have to fund the porting
of each new plug-in to the StrongArm instruction set.</p><p>Instead, Crusoe offers out-of-the-box compatibility with all
web content. In addition, it gives the system maker the choice of
Linux, Windows CE, or any other operating system that already runs
on the x86 platform. Crusoe also supports all of the popular x86
software-development tools. The chip's low power and x86
compatibility give it a clear advantage in this market
segment.</p><p>The bad news is that the market for web pads is basically
nonexistent, limiting Transmeta's potential sales. Crusoe burns too
much power for today's most popular portable web device, the Palm
VII. But this market could grow to tens of millions of units over
the next five years, and Transmeta is poised to grow along with
it.</p><p>By boldly combining hardware and software in a new way,
Transmeta has built a processor with clear advantages in power and
compatibility. If Transmeta delivers on its performance claims,
Crusoe should launch a new class of devices which let you take the
Web wherever you go. With their code-morphing software, Crusoe
devices will run nearly any operating system. But as Transmeta's
Torvalds says with a smile, they will run Linux just a little bit
better.</p></div></div>
