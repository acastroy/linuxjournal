    What's new at Novell...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2602580.0x26fa500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) is a client-server protocol for obtaining directory-based
information. It was originally developed at the University of
Michigan as a method to access X.500 directory information over
TCP/IP.
</p><p>Today, LDAP servers are typically stand-alone applications
rather than gateways to X.500 directories. This isn't a terribly
surprising development, since X.500 can be difficult to implement
and resource-intensive for X.500 clients.</p><p>LDAP is an Internet standard controlled by the IETF and is
used in products by Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, Netscape and many
others.</p><p>While the description of LDAP sounds fairly boring, it's an
incredibly useful tool. Most users' first experience with LDAP will
be looking up someone's e-mail address on a large LDAP server like
Bigfoot. Check out your address book in Netscape, and you'll see
that you can use various LDAP servers to search for people.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2602580.0x26fa710"></a>Novell</h2></div></div><p>Founded in 1983 as a LAN specialist, Novell is now best known
for NetWare and Novell Directory Services (NDS), and is present in
over 80% of Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>Novell's major competitor in the commercial network directory
market is Microsoft, which is planning to unveil their Active
Directory as part of the Windows 2000 release.</p><p>In January, Novell announced the planned release of their
LDAP Libraries for C Software Development Kit. The new SDK will
allow developers to use the LDAP API to access Novell's NDS
eDirectory. While this was possible before using third-party LDAP
libraries, this is the first Novell developer library to support
the LDAP API. The LDAP SDK will be released as part of the Novell
Developer Kit (NDK) in March.</p><p>The SDK is based on the OpenLDAP Project's client library,
written in C. Created to promote and develop commercial-grade
open-source LDAP applications and tools, the OpenLDAP Project is
coordinated by the OpenLDAP Foundation, a not-for-profit
corporation.</p><p>How will this new relationship between Novell and OpenLDAP
benefit OpenLDAP and the Open Source community? Novell is now a
member of the OpenLDAP development community and is contributing
enhancements, bug fixes, testing and documentation.</p><p>According to OpenLDAP's chief architect Kurt Zeilenga,
&ldquo;Novell developers are active on project mailing lists and have
contributed a number of minor enhancements and bug fixes. We look
forward to more significant contributions from Novell.&rdquo;</p><p>The impact of Novell's contribution to the OpenLDAP project
will not likely be seen by OpenLDAP users until the release of
OpenLDAP 2.0, scheduled for general release sometime in the first
quarter of 2000.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Novell's plans extend beyond just helping
the OpenLDAP Project. This includes enhancing the OpenLDAP client
libraries by adding NDS-specific extensions that will eventually be
available as source code from Novell, creating tutorials and
enhanced API documentation and providing commercial technical
support. Novell will offer commercial support through its Developer
Support program, ranging from free newsgroup access to paid support
technicians.</p><p>Novell's customers also stand to benefit from the LDAP SDK.
Kris Magnusson, open-source architect for Novell, believes,
&ldquo;Novell's LDAP SDK promotes an open standard, LDAP v3, as the
preferred access mechanism for NDS eDirectory. Because developers
will be able to use the LDAP v3 Internet standard to access NDS
eDirectory, they can write to a single, open SDK.&rdquo;</p><p>In order to use the Novell LDAP SDK, Windows developers will
use an InstallShield-based self-extracting executable, while
NetWare installation will take place through Novell Installation
Services. Linux and UNIX users will install source or binary
packages distributed as &ldquo;tarballs&rdquo;, a common choice for
open-source projects.</p><p>Using open-source products as part of commercial products is
becoming increasingly popular, and OpenLDAP's software is a perfect
fit. As part of their eServer product, Caldera Systems has also
included OpenLDAP's software.</p><p>Novell's adoption of OpenLDAP's open-source SDK and
commitment to contribute source code and documentation signal a
change in corporate strategy. Novell's LDAP SDK plans provide clear
benefits to both the Open Source community and Novell, resulting in
a win-win solution.</p><p><a href="3876s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
