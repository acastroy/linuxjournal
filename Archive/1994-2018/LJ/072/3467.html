    Mr. Anderson describes some general principles and
    techniques for installing and maintaining configurations on
    a large number of hosts and describes in detail the local
    configuration system at Edinburgh University.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x29686b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The difficulty of installing and setting
up Linux is often mentioned as one of the reasons it is not more
widely used. People usually assume that editing the traditional
UNIX configuration files is more difficult than using the graphical
interfaces provided by operating systems like Microsoft Windows.
For a novice user with a single machine, this may be true, and most
commercial UNIX vendors now supply GUI-based tools for at least
some aspects of system configuration. Under Linux, projects like
COAS (see Resources 1) and the Red Hat distribution are starting to
cater to this need.
</p><p>For a large installation with tens or hundreds of machines,
the GUI approach does not work&mdash;entering individual configuration
data for 200 machines is simply not practical. As well as the
ability to install large numbers of machines, big sites usually
need more control over the configuration; for example, they might
need to install new machines with a configuration which is
guaranteed to be identical to an existing one. Machines are also
likely to need periodical reconfiguring as their use changes, or
simply to keep up to date with the latest software and
patches.</p><p>To do this effectively requires a good deal of automation,
and large UNIX sites have been developing their own tools for many
years (see Resources 2). The flexibility and accessibility of UNIX
configuration files makes Linux particularly suitable for
automation, and those sites attempting to install and manage large
numbers of NT systems are often likely to find the process more
difficult (see Resources 3).</p><p>The Division of Informatics at Edinburgh University has over
500 UNIX machines, with a wide variety of different configurations.
Most of them are installed and maintained automatically using the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LCFG</em></span> (Local ConFiGuration) system, originally
developed several years ago (see Resources 4). Both client and
server configurations can be easily reproduced to replace failed
machines or to create tens of identical systems for a new
laboratory. Reconfiguration is thus a continuous process; for
example, machines adjust every night to ensure they are carrying
the latest versions of the required software. Linux (we use a
version of the Red Hat distribution) has proven itself well-suited
to this environment, and it has recently overtaken Solaris to
become the most popular desktop system, both for staff use and
student laboratories.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2968920"></a>Make-Up of a Good Configuration System</h2></div></div><p>An automatic configuration system should be able to build
working machines from scratch with no manual intervention. This
includes configuration of the basic operating system (disk
partitions, network adaptors), loading of required software, and
configuration of application-specific services such as web servers.
This allows failed machines to be recreated quickly, using
replacement hardware, and new machines to be installed efficiently,
even by junior staff. As a side effect, it also avoids the need for
backups of any system partition.</p><p>The set of configuration information that drives this build
process defines the <span   class="emphasis"><em>personality</em></span> of an
individual machine, and it is extremely useful if this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>specification</em></span> is available in an explicit form
(such as a plaintext file or a database). Machines can then be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cloned</em></span> simply by copying their specification
and applying the automatic build. This is important for installing
multiple similar machines, such as in a student laboratory. The
master copy of the specification should be held remotely from the
machine, so that it is available even when the machine is down.
This allows programs to automatically verify individual
configurations and even the relationships between machines, such as
ensuring every client's specified DNS server is actually configured
to run a name daemon. The specification can also be generated from
higher-level descriptions of a machine's function. An inheritance
model is very useful, since many machine configurations can be
conveniently described as small variations of a generic
configuration for a particular class.</p><p>Traditional configuration systems are often
<span   class="emphasis"><em>static</em></span>, in the sense that the configuration is
applied only at the time the machine is installed. Most
vendor-supplied installation processes fall into this category, as
do systems based on cloning by copying disk images. If subsequent
changes to the configuration have to be applied manually, the
configuration is almost certain to &ldquo;rot&rdquo;, and it is impossible to
be confident that all machines are correctly configured. Obvious
misconfigurations simply result in users having malfunctioning
machines. More subtle misconfigurations may go unnoticed and pose
serious security problems, for example. Even though a fully
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dynamic</em></span> system is not practical, an ideal
system will continually adjust the configuration to conform to the
specification. Some parameters can be changed immediately to track
a change in the specification; some, such as a network address, may
be changed only when the machine reboots; and others, such as a
disk partitioning, may require a complete rebuild.</p><p>If a configuration system is incomplete and manual
intervention is necessary, many of the benefits are lost. However,
constructing a comprehensive system to cover every conceivable
parameter is clearly impractical. The key problem is trying to
create an extensible framework flexible enough to allow new
parameters and <span   class="emphasis"><em>components</em></span> to be incorporated
with little effort. An individual instance of the system can then
evolve at a particular site to suit the local requirements. If it
is going to be extended on demand by working administrators, the
framework needs to be extremely lightweight and comprehensible in a
short amount of time. It must be easy to create components in a
familiar language, and to interface them to new subsystems which
require configuration. Open-source software is an advantage, since
it is often easy to base a new extension on one that already
exists.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2968d40"></a>The LCFG Framework</h2></div></div><p>Before the introduction of LCFG, we were configuring machines
using a typical range of techniques, including vendor installs and
disk copying (cloning). These were followed by the application of a
monolithic script which applied assorted &ldquo;tweaks&rdquo; for all the
different configuration variations. This met with virtually none of
the requirements listed above and was a nightmare to manage.</p><p>The available alternatives ranged from large commercial
systems (too expensive and probably too inflexible) to systems
developed at individual sites for their own use (often not much of
an improvement over our existing process). More recently,
interesting tools such as COAS and the GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>cfengine</b></span> (see Resources 5) have
appeared, but we are still not aware of any comparable system which
addresses quite the same set of requirements as LCFG.</p><p>Given limited development resources, we attempted to design
an initial system as a number of independent subsystems, intending
to use temporary implementations for some of the ones where we
could leverage existing technology:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Resource Repository</em></span>: design a
standard syntax for representing resources (individual
configuration parameters). These would be stored in a central place
where they could be analysed and processed as well as distributed
to individual machines.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Resource Compiler</em></span>: preprocess
the resources so that we could create configurations by inheritance
and avoid specifying large numbers of low-level resources
explicitly.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Distribution Mechanism</em></span>:
distribute the master copy of the resources to clients on demand in
a robust way.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Component Framework</em></span>: provide a
framework which allows components to be easily written for
configuring new subsystems and services, using the resources from
the repository.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Core Components</em></span>: implement a
number of core components, including basic OS installation and the
standard daemons. We wanted some of these to act as exemplars to
make it as easy as possible for other people to create new
components.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x29694d0"></a>The Resources</h2></div></div><p>Items of configuration data are represented as key,value
pairs, in a way similar to X resources. The key consists of three
parts: the hostname, the component and the attribute. For example,
the nameserver (cul) for the host wyrgly is configured by the DNS
component:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wyrgly.dns.servers: cul.dcs.ed.ac.uk
</pre><p>Notice that this specification is a rather abstract
representation, not directly tied to the form in which the
configuration is actually required by the machine, in this case, as
a line in the resolv.conf file. This allows the same representation
to be used for different platforms, and it permits high-level
programs to analyse and generate the resources easily . The LCFG
components on each machine are responsible for translating these
resources into the appropriate form for the particular platform.
COAS uses a similar representation for configuration parameters.
</p><p>The resources are currently stored in simple text files, with
one file per host. This collection of files forms the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>repository</em></span>. We intend to provide a
special-purpose language for specifying these resources; it would
support inheritance, default configurations, validation and some
concept of higher-level specifications. However, we are currently
using a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; solution based on the C preprocessor,
followed by a short Perl script to preprocess the resources. The C
preprocessor provides file inclusion and macros, which can be used
for primitive inheritance. The Perl script allows inherited
resources to be modified with regular expressions. Wild cards are
also supported to provide default values.</p><p>In practice, most machines have very short resource files
which simply inherit some standard templates. Machines can be
cloned simply by copying these resource files. Often, a few
resources are overridden to provide slight variations. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;generic_client.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux.h&gt;
#include &lt;portable.h&gt;
amd.localhome:  paul
auth.users:     paul
</pre><p>The name of the host is not necessary in the resource keys,
because this is generated from the name of the resource file.
</p><p>Resources are currently distributed to clients using NIS
(Sun's Network Information System). This is another &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;
solution which is far from ideal; we hope to replace it in the near
future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2969898"></a>The Component Framework</h2></div></div><p>A number of components on each machine take the resources
from the repository and implement the specified configuration in
whatever way is appropriate for that particular platform. The
components are currently implemented as shell scripts which take a
standard set of <span   class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> arguments, rather like
the rc.d startup scripts under Red Hat Linux:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>START</b></span>: executed
when the system boots.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>STOP</b></span>: executed
when the system shuts down.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>RUN</b></span>: executed
periodically (from <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>).</p></li></ul></div><p>A client-server program (<span   class="bold"><b>om</b></span>)
also allows methods to be executed on demand on multiple remote
machines. Components may have other arbitrary methods in addition
to the standard ones.
</p><p>Different types of components will perform different actions
at different times. Typically, a daemon might be started at boot
time, reloaded periodically, and stopped at shutdown. Some
components however, might simply perform a reconfiguration at boot
time, or start only in response to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>RUN</em></span>
method (for example, a backup system).</p><p>Component scripts normally inherit a set of subroutines from
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>generic</em></span> component. This provides default
methods and various utility procedures for operations such as
resource retrieval. This makes simple components easy to write, and
scripts are frequently quite short.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2d62220"></a>Some Important Components</h2></div></div><p>A typical host runs 20 to 30 components, controlling
subsystems such as web servers, printers, NIS services, NFS
configuration and various other daemons. Two components are worth
mentioning in more detail.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>boot</b></span> component is the
only one run directly from the system startup files. This uses
resources to determine which other components to start. The set of
services running on a particular machine is therefore controlled by
the boot resources.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span> component
normally runs nightly, as well as at boot time. This uses the
extremely useful <span   class="bold"><b>updaterpms</b></span>
program which compares the RPMs installed on a machine with those
specified via the resources. RPMs are automatically installed or
deleted to synchronise the state of the machine with the
specification. This means that all machines in the same class are
always guaranteed to have identical sets of up-to-date packages.
Changing an inherited resource file will automatically reconfigure
the RPMs carried by all machines in the class.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2d624e0"></a>Machine Installation</h2></div></div><p>As much configuration as possible is performed dynamically by
the various components. However, some configuration, such as disk
partitioning, must be hard-wired at installation time. New machines
are booted using an installation floppy, which mounts a root file
system from the network, a CD or Zip drive. The boot process runs a
special <span   class="bold"><b>install</b></span> component which
determines all necessary install-time parameters by interpreting
the machine's <span   class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span> resources. A very
minimal template is installed on the new system and the
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span> component is used to load
the initial set of RPMs.</p><p>This supports completely unattended builds of new machines,
as well as rebuilds of existing machines. If there is any doubt
about the integrity of a system, it is normal for us to simply
rebuild it from scratch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2870580.0x2d62748"></a>Problems and Future Plans</h2></div></div><p>The concept of an open, lightweight framework has been very
important; many people have contributed components so that
virtually everything which varies between our machines is now
handled by LCFG. This has made the system very successful; however,
much of the implementation is still based on technologies
originally intended to be temporary. We are currently planning to
expand the use of LCFG beyond our own department and this is
motivating a redesign of some of the subsystems, although the basic
architecture will remain the same:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We hope to implement a new syntax for specifying
the resources, together with a special-purpose resource
compiler.</p></li><li><p>We hope to replace the NIS distribution with
something simpler which is available earlier in the boot
sequence.</p></li><li><p>We would like to re-implement the components in
Perl, using Perl inheritance to provide generic operations.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other items on the wish list include caching support for
portables and secure signing of resources.
