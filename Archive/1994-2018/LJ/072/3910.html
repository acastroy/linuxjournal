    A look at how the kernel schedules tasks for both
    uni-processor and multi-processor machines.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a1580.0x11993a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we started a new series on
Linux kernel internals. In that first part, we looked at how Linux
manages processes and why in many ways Linux is better at creating
and maintaining processes than many commercial UNIX systems.
</p><p>This time, we dwell a bit on the subject of scheduling. Much
to my surprise, here again, Linux goes the unorthodox way and
disregards conventional wisdom in kernel theory. The results are
excellent. Let's see how.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a1580.0x1199500"></a>Scheduling Classes</h2></div></div><p>In Linux 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> there are three classes
of processes, as can be seen from the data definition for the
scheduler (from linux/include/linux/sched.h):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* Scheduling Policies
*/
#define SCHED_OTHER  0
#define SCHED_FIFO   1
#define SCHED_RR     2
</pre><p>SCHED_OTHER tasks are the normal user tasks (default).
</p><p>Tasks running in <b  >SCHED_FIFO</b> will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> be preempted. They will leave the CPU
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for waiting sync kernel events or if an
explicit sleep or reschedule has been requested from user
space.</p><p>Tasks running in SCHED_RR are real time (RT), but they will
leave the CPU if there is another real-time task in the run queue.
So the CPU power will be distributed between all
<b  >SCHED_RR</b> tasks. If at least one RT task is
running, no other <b  >SCHED_OTHER</b> task will be
allowed to run in any CPU. Each RT task has an
<b  >rt_priority</b> so the <b  >SCHED_RR</b>
class will be allowed to distribute the CPU power between all the
SCHED_RR tasks at will. The <b  >rt_priority</b> of the
<b  >SCHED_RR</b> class works exactly as the normal
priority field for of the <b  >SCHED_OTHER</b> (default)
class.</p><p>Only the root user can change the class of the current task
via the <span   class="bold"><b>sched_setscheduler</b></span>
syscall.</p><p>One of the tasks of a kernel is to make sure the system
remains firmly under its control even in situations of misbehaving
programs. One such misbehaving program might
<span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> too many processes too
quickly. Thus, the kernel becomes so busy with itself that it
cannot cater to its other responsibilities. I found out that Linux
has no limit to how fast user-land programs can spawn children.
HP-UX, Solaris and AIX have a limit of one fork per processor tick
(called a jiffie under Linux). The patch in Listing 1 (see
Resources) will allow a maximum of one fork per jiffie (one jiffie
is usually 1/100 second, except on the Alpha architecture where it
is 1/1024).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a1580.0x1199c90"></a>Tangled in the Threads</h2></div></div><p>Threads are necessary to allow your process to make use of
multiple processors. Linux doesn't really make any distinction
between a process and a thread from a memory management and
scheduling point of view. Some operating systems, like Solaris,
manage threads within the user process by means of a thread
scheduling library. The kernel sees only the process and doesn't
know which thread, if any, is actually executing inside the user
process. This saves the kernel from managing lists with thousands
of entries for each thread for each process.</p><p>Obviously, the threads emulated on the top of one single user
process won't be allowed to run concurrently on SMP, so the
user-space approach won't scale very well on an SMP machine.
Threading is strictly necessary only when all threads will be
CPU-bound and not mainly I/O-oriented. If all the threads are
CPU-bound, you definitely want to be able to scale for SMP.</p><p>Using threads only to wait for events is overkill. On the
other hand, having threads sleeping is a waste of resources and
performance. Almost all subsystems in Linux (such as TCP/IP) offer
async event registration. Using async event via the
<b  >SIGIO</b> signal is similar to IRQ-driven
handling.</p><p>With the user-space approach, you will at least avoid the TLB
(translation lookaside buffer) flushing, as all the threads will
share the same address space.</p><p>The advantage of having threads managed in user space through
the threads library is the kernel will spend the scheduling CPU
cost in user space. It is true that in user space, you may choose
to implement a very fast round-robin scheduler that may cut down
the scheduling cost, compared to the clever (but more expensive, in
terms of execution path) Linux scheduler.</p><p>Speaking of SMP, as of Linux 2.4 I found there is no way to
declare the processor affinity of any given user-space
process.</p><p>The scheduler could keep track of the CPU affinity
declaration of a process, or it could just determine a preferred
CPU for a process by itself. The other day, together with Andrea
Arcangeli of Italy, I designed the simple kernel patch in Listing 2
(see Resources) that implements processor affinity. Notice that
processor affinity makes the most sense when other processes are
excluded from running on this CPU. A better way to implement this
patch would be to have the system administrator set affinity with
an external call like <span   class="bold"><b>nice</b></span>.</p><p>The 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> SMP kernel scheduler has some
bugs that sometimes make it less effective than the UP
(UniProcessor) scheduler. Nevertheless, Andrea fixed all such bugs
and rewrote the heuristics from scratch and the SMP scheduler gives
an impressive SMP improvement under load. The SMP changes are just
in the 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels, and I plan to integrate
it in 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> also. You can get Andrea's patch
at
<a href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/SMP-scheduler-2_2_11-E" target="_self">ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/SMP-scheduler-2_2_11-E</a>.
That patch can be used against 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 and speeds up both
kernels on SMP systems. The patch was merged into 2.3.15, but not
yet in 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> because it's a performance issue
only and not a true bug fix.</p><p>The SMP scheduler heuristic mechanism works as a function of
(not in any particular order):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the idle CPUs</p></li><li><p>the last CPU where the
<span   class="bold"><b>wakenup</b></span> task was running</p></li><li><p>the memory management of the task (for optimising
kernel-threads reschedule)</p></li><li><p>the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of the tasks running on the busy
CPUs</p></li><li><p>the time necessary to invalidate the L2 cache on
the running CPU (<b  >cacheflush_time</b>)</p></li><li><p>the average time slice
(<b  >avg_slice</b>) of the wakenup task (how much time
the task runs before returning to sleep)</p></li></ul></div><p>The algorithm collects the above data and chooses the best
CPU on which to reschedule the wakenup task.
</p><p>There are two paths involved in the Linux scheduler
behavior:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>schedule</b></span>: the
running/current task is a SCHED_OTHER task that expired its time
slice (so the kernel runs a schedule while returning from the timer
IRQ for switching to the next running task).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>reschedule_idle</b></span>: a
task got a wakeup (usually from an IRQ), and so we try to
reschedule such wakenup task in the best CPU by invoking a schedule
on it (it's a kind of controlled schedule).</p></li></ul></div><p>Both paths share the
<span   class="bold"><b>goodness</b></span> function. The goodness
function can be considered the core of the SMP scheduler. It
calculates the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a task as a function of the
following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the task currently running</p></li><li><p>the task that wants to run</p></li><li><p>the current CPU</p></li></ul></div>

The source for the goodness function can be found in Listing 3 (see
Resources).
</p><p><a href="3910l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>A plain schedule only works based on goodness. As you can see
in Listing 3, a plain schedule is SMP-aware. The goodness of the
potential next task increases if its last CPU is the current
CPU.</p><p>Nevertheless, reschedule_idle is far more critical for CPU
affinity and scheduler latencies; for example, if you comment out
reschedule_idle, the scheduler latency will become infinite. Also,
reschedule_idle takes care of the cache-flush time and the task
average time slice, and this is the truly interesting part of the
SMP scheduler. In UP, reschedule_idle is not as interesting as the
SMP version. Listing 4 (see Resources) is the reschedule_idle
implementation taken from 2.3.26 (soon 2.4).</p><p>The final objective of reschedule_idle is to call a schedule
on a CPU in order to reschedule the wakenup task in it. We use
goodness in reschedule_idle because we want to predict the effect
of the future schedule that we'll send to that CPU. By predicting
the effect of the future schedule, we can choose the best CPU to
reschedule at wakeup time. This, of course, saves us the trouble of
executing on a CPU without the proper TLB settings. If the CPU to
reschedule is not the current one, we send a reschedule event via
inter-CPU message passing (SMP-IPI interrupt on i386).</p><p>To make it very clear: the goodness function is the core of
the Linux scheduler and is SMP aware, while reschedule_idle is the
core of the clever SMP heuristics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a1580.0x15932d0"></a>Kernel Preemption and User Preemption</h2></div></div><p>Linux can only do user preemption. Linus Torvalds, it seems,
doesn't believe in kernel preemption. That's not as bad as it may
seem; all is fine for semaphores. Critical sections protected by
semaphores can be preempted at any time, as every contention will
end in a schedule and there can't be any deadlock. However,
critical sections protected by fast spin locks or by hand locks
cannot be preempted unless we block the timer IRQ. So all spin
locks should be IRQ-safe. Also, by avoiding kernel preemption, the
kernel becomes more robust and simpler, since a lot of complicated
code can be saved this way.</p><p>By the way, there are tools to monitor the scheduler latency
in order to allow the interested hacker to catch potential code
sections that need conditional schedules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a1580.0x1593430"></a>Implications for Linux</h2></div></div><p>Linux, due to its GPL nature, allows us to do things faster
than others, because you can adapt and recompile your own kernel
instead of using a standard fit-all kernel. For example, in some
popular proprietary operating systems such as Solaris 7, many code
sections have been packaged within
<span   class="bold"><b>spin_lock</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>spin_unlock</b></span> to make the same code
work well in both UP and SMP systems. While vendors of these
commercial operating systems tout this as a clear advantage for
heavy SMP systems, these locks actually bog down UP systems and
simple SMP machines, because the same binary driver must work on
both SMP and UP kernels. A
<span   class="bold"><b>spin_unlock</b></span> is one locked ASM
instruction:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define spin_unlock_string \
        "lock ; btrl $0,%0"
</pre><p>and calling such clear-bit instruction through a function
pointer is complete <span   class="emphasis"><em>overkill</em></span>.
</p><p>Linux, on the other hand, has in-line code sections for UP
and SMP systems, adapting to the machine it is running on.
Therefore, if only a UniProcessor system is hosting the kernel, no
time is lost locking a code section that doesn't need it.</p><p>Last but not least, as we saw above, the goodness function
makes the SMP scheduler in Linux very clever. Having a clever SMP
scheduler is critical for performance. If the scheduler is not
SMP-aware, OS theory teaches us that the performance on an SMP
machine can be even worse than on a UP machine. (This was happening
in 2.2.x <span   class="emphasis"><em>without the new heuristics, but has now been
fixed.)</em></span></p><p>That's it for this month. I hope you gained some deeper
understanding of how Linux schedules tasks on UP and SMP
systems.</p><p><a href="3910s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
