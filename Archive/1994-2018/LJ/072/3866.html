    Setting up a Linux gateway can be a rewarding experience in
    both home and commercial environments.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x13715b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Networks are extremely common these
days&mdash;you see them in businesses, schools, even homes. Networking
is popular because it allows users to share resources. You can
share files, printers and a myriad of other devices in a network.
Now, wouldn't it be great if you could share an Internet
connection? With Linux, you can.
</p><p>Setting up Linux as an Internet gateway is not difficult to
do. A Linux gateway allows two or more computers to use the
Internet at the same time. While doing so, only the gateway's IP
address will be visible on the Internet. The rest of the computers
will be &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; behind the gateway. This is called IP
masquerading.</p><p>What can you do with this setup? Well, if you have four
computers connected to the gateway, you can surf the Web from any
of the four computers at the same time. You can run telnet
sessions, go on IRC (Internet relay chat), read newsgroups,
etc.&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> anything you can do on the
Internet can be done. Of course, there are certain things that may
need your attention, and I will discuss them as well as setting up
both Linux and Windows machines to use the gateway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x13717c0"></a>What You Need</h2></div></div><p>First of all, you need a working TCP/IP network. I assume
your network is up and running, and all your machines are able to
&ldquo;see&rdquo; each other.</p><p>I will discuss setting up IP masquerading using Linux kernel
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and ipchains 1.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.
If for some reason you are running an early kernel such as
1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, please refer to
Chris Kostick's articles on IP masquerading in issues 27 and 43 of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Also, please make sure you have a copy of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
IP Masquerade mini HOWTO</em></span>
(<a href="http://ipmasq.cjb.net" target="_self">http://ipmasq.cjb.net/</a>)
by Ambrose Au and David Ranch. It contains much more detailed
information on setting up IP masquerading, including setting up
Macintosh and Windows NT clients. It also contains a useful FAQ
should you run into problems. This article is based on that mini
HOWTO as well as personal experience.</p><p>I also assume you are familiar with basic Linux system
administration, and that you know how to recompile your kernel and
modify your <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x1371c90"></a>What Do You Want to Do?</h2></div></div><p>The next thing to figure out is what you want to do. How many
machines are on the network? Which machine do you wish to set up as
the gateway? Which machines will be the clients? What operating
system is each machine running? The answers to these questions can
be complex and unique, so for the purposes of this article, we will
use the setup shown in Figure 1. This is a three-node network with
a Linux gateway (antioch), a Linux client (nazareth) and a Windows
95 client (lystra).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3866f1.large.jpg"><img src="3866f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Gateway Setup
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x1371f50"></a>Setting Up the Gateway</h2></div></div><p>Let's start by setting up the gateway, which in our case is
antioch (192.168.0.1). Antioch runs Linux
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, and in order for it to become a
gateway, we need to turn on certain kernel options. My gateway has
the kernel options shown in Table 1 turned on.</p><p><a href="3866t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>After booting our newly compiled kernel, we will have to load
a few kernel modules using either
<span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/insmod ip_masq_user
/sbin/insmod ip_masq_raudio
/sbin/insmod ip_masq_ftp
/sbin/insmod ip_masq_irc
</pre><p>It would be wise to add these lines into one of your init
scripts so they will run on every startup. There are other kernel
modules related to IP masquerading; for a full list, type the
command
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/modprobe -l | grep ip_masq
</pre>


Linux 2.2 does not turn on IP forwarding by default. To find out
whether IP forwarding is switched on, check the contents of the
file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward. If it is <b  >0</b>,
IP forwarding is off; if <b  >1</b>, it is on.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
0
# echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
1
</pre>


Again, it is wise to add the line which turns on IP forwarding (the
one with the <span   class="bold"><b>echo</b></span> command) to one
of your init scripts.
</p><p>Now we come to an interesting situation. How do we know who
gets to use the gateway and who doesn't? This is where
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> comes in. My current
policy is to deny access to the gateway from everybody unless
explicitly allowed. For example, let's say we want only our client
machines nazareth and lystra to access our gateway and no one else.
In order to do this, we have to issue the following
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.0.2/255.255.255.0\
  -j MASQ
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.0.3/255.255.255.0\
  -j MASQ
</pre><p>If, on the other hand, we want everybody on the network
192.168.0.* to use the gateway, we can issue these commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0\
  -j MASQ
</pre>


Note that we assume the netmask is 255.255.255.0. If your netmask
is different, simply change the values accordingly. There are many
other things you can do with ipchains; however, they are beyond the
scope of this article. I trust that the two simple examples above
will get you started. (See also &ldquo;Building a Firewall with IP
Chains&rdquo; by Pedro Bueno,
<a href="../068/3622.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issue/issue68/3622.html</a>.)
</p><p>That's it! The gateway is now up and running. Remember to add
the relevant lines to the startup scripts. Also remember to connect
to the Internet before testing your gateway. Now let's set up the
clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x1372738"></a>Setting Up the Linux Client</h2></div></div><p>Setting up the Linux client (nazareth, 192.168.0.2) is very
easy. All you need do is issue the following command on
nazareth:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add default gw antioch
</pre><p>Now try pinging an external site (let's say www.ssc.com) to
see if it responds:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ping www.ssc.com
</pre>


If it responds, you are in business! If it doesn't, check the FAQ
included with the mini-HOWTO for solutions to frequently
encountered problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x1372948"></a>Setting Up the Windows Client</h2></div></div><p>Setting up the Windows client is a bit more troublesome. Here
are the steps involved:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Go to the Control Panel and double-click
Network.</p></li><li><p>Locate the icon that represents your TCP/IP
protocol for your network interface card. Open up its
Properties.</p></li><li><p>Click on the Gateway tab. Add 192.168.0.1 as the
gateway.</p></li><li><p>Click on the DNS Configuration tab. Under DNS
Server search order, add your ISP's DNS server IP addresses.</p></li><li><p>Press OK on all the dialog boxes.</p></li><li><p>Reboot the machine.</p></li></ol></div><p>Again, test your gateway by accessing an external site (use
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> or your web browser or
whatever). If all goes well, you should be able to do most things
you usually do on the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x176b1c8"></a>Precautions</h2></div></div><p>There are a few things you should be aware of when setting up
your Linux gateway.</p><p>First of all, certain Internet applications may not work well
with our setup. For a list of what works and what does not, see the
latest version of the IP Masquerade mini HOWTO.</p><p>A few applications may require you to load specific kernel
modules. In our case, for example, we have already loaded
<span   class="bold"><b>ip_masq_raudio</b></span>, which will take
care of any Real Audio connections. If you want to run Quake,
VDOLive or CUSeeMe, you will need to load their respective kernel
modules.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that applications on your
Linux client machine may not work properly if your gateway is not
connected to the Internet. One such application may be sendmail.
Therefore, if you know your gateway is off-line, you may want to
remove your gateway's IP address from your Linux client's routing
table. To do so, just issue the following command on the Linux
client machine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route del default
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1279580.0x176b488"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>A Linux gateway offers a great solution to using and sharing
a connection to an external network. Linux is extremely suitable
for use as a gateway for both home and commercial networks because
it is low in cost and reliable.</p></div></div>
