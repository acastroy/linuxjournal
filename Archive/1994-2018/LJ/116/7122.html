</p><p>Next to adventure, this game or a variation of it has to be about the oldest computer game. I remember playing a game like this years ago in which two artillery guns lobbed crude-looking bombs at each other. But even before that, in the days when I was using punched paper tape and an acoustic 75-baud modem to connect to a mainframe, I remember playing a game where you input gravity and wind, then set angle and round velocity and tried to hit a computer gun before it hit you. Although light-years beyond either of those primitive games, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Atanks</em></span> is basically the same, only with more and better weapons and shields. Requires: liballeg, libpthread, libXext, libX11, libdl, libstdc++, libm, libgcc_s and glibc.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7122f1.jpg"></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa5580.0x1b9d2f0"></a>diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2></div></div><p>by Zach Brown</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bryan O'Sullivan</b></span> has produced <span   class="bold"><b>Netplug</b></span>, a d&aelig;mon that monitors whether network cables are plugged in and responds by bringing up or shutting down the system's network connection. This is useful for laptops and other systems that move around a lot or that are part of a Beowulf or other cluster. Netplug performs a similar task to the existing <span   class="bold"><b>ifplugd</b></span> Project by <span   class="bold"><b>Lennart Poettering</b></span> and others, and there may be some movement toward integrating the two projects.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/kcore</b></span> interface to system memory may be going away in 2.6 because of the difficulty in maintaining it across the range of architectures and even across multiple versions of a single architecture. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> feels that few people actually use the interface, judging from the lack of complaints whenever it breaks; he believes it may be more trouble than it's worth. It turns out, however, that some developers do use the interface for debugging purposes, although they all agree a much better solution would be to include a proper debugger in the kernel itself. Linus always has been reluctant to do this, because he feels it lowers the quality of developers' debugging efforts.</p><p>Several developers have lodged complaints with Linus Torvalds, because he occasionally modifies changelog entries for patches that already have been accepted into the <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span> repository. Some developers call this censorship, some say it could lead to legal hassles, and some say it avoids proper version control because the history of the changelog entry is lost. But Linus feels it is good practice to make sure all changelog entries are well formed and accurately describe their corresponding patches. And, it was he who asked <span   class="bold"><b>Larry McVoy</b></span> to add the <tt  >bk comment</tt> command, which easily allows such modifications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>NFS</b></span> behaves a bit differently in 2.6 from the way it behaved in 2.4, resulting in a true incompatibility between the two stable series. The problem seems to boil down to a <tt  >#define NFSEXP_CROSSMNT</tt> expression that always had a slightly inaccurate meaning, one that was corrected in the 2.6-test kernels. Changing it back would mean re-introducing the inaccuracy, so it looks as though the incompatibility will stick around. The incompatibility occurs when third-party code includes the header file containing the affected #define. A simple workaround exists to fix all affected source code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Junio C. Hamano</b></span> brought <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span>'s <span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span> compressed filesystem code from 2.4 up to the 2.6-test tree. SquashFS appears to be the most promising compressed filesystem currently available for Linux, although it still provides only one-time write access; thereafter only read access is available. Full read-write access may be added in the future, however. Meanwhile, its predecessor, CramFS, is looking for another maintainer. <span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Quinlan</b></span> remains the official maintainer, but he would prefer to step down if a suitable replacement can be found.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa5580.0x1b9dad8"></a>Asymptopia Flash Card: <a href="http://www.asymptopia.com" target="_self">www.asymptopia.com</a></h2></div></div><p>by David Bandel</p><p>Want to study while you're working at your computer?

On one side were those who felt that calculators were, on the whole, a good tool and that students should be taught to use them. On the other side were those who felt that calculators were a crutch, that their use would pollute the minds of impressionable youth and that their appearance was a sure sign of The End Times.</p><p>What both optimists and pessimists believed, however, deep down, was that their opinions mattered. &ldquo;Someday&rdquo;, each of them thought, &ldquo;someone is going to ask me what we should do about these here calculators.&rdquo; What the adults didn't understand, but me and my 5th grade posse did, was that calculators, having arrived, were never going away.</p><p>&mdash;Clay Shirky, <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/20030701.shtml#46771" target="_self">www.corante.com/many/20030701.shtml#46771</a></p></div></div>
