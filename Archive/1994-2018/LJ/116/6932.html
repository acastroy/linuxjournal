CD-ROM content needs a search engine that can run in
any browser, straight from static index files. JavaScript and XML make
it possible.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x272f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently was working on a CD-ROM catalog for a client, and he requested that it
have keyword search ability. My searches for solutions to such a
request kept turning up proprietary OS software that required an
install on the user's machine and a license fee paid per copy distributed.
Such installation requirements are limiting and
would cost a lot over time. Furthermore, all of the CD-ROM users were not going to be
using a single proprietary OS, so this automatically reduced the potential
customer base. While sitting back to think about the situation, a
package in my mailbox caught my eye&mdash;the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Archive CD. I figured
if anybody had solved this problem, it was sure to be on the
<i  >LJ</i> Archive.
Imagine my disappointment upon discovering that the <i  >LJ</i>
Archive CD has a
really good index but no search engine. If a solution was to be found,
I would have to find it myself.
This article is about scratching that proverbial itch with jsFind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x272f450"></a>
Licensing</h2></div></div><p>
One of my earliest considerations was how to distribute and license
my solution, jsFind.
I showed early versions of it to colleagues, and they felt I should follow the
model in which I license the code and then market it. jsFind
then would be using the same model as other competing search engines
for this type of content.
Personally, I would
rather spend my time coding than marketing, and I suspect the total market
is not very large. I would rather get informative CD-ROMs and be
able to search them easily using any browser and platform I choose.
</p><p>
The GNU Public License (GPL) was more in line with my goals.
By freely distributing jsFind, it would be marketed based on its own merits,
gaining improvements and contributions as it grows.
At the risk of preaching to
the choir, one of the goals of proprietary systems is to lock users in to being
required to use their system by every possible means. For example, when one gets
a CD-ROM and is required to use a specific
browser and a specific OS to use the search engine, then that user is forced to
access a copy of that OS. CD-ROM producers also are forced to keep
buying development tools for that OS in order to stay current. The
result is consumers and producers are locked in to the
proprietary OS vendor.
Releasing jsFind under the
GPL would break the cycle.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x272f5b0"></a>
How It Was Done</h2></div></div><p>
The jsFind keyword search engine itself is a small JavaScript program of about
500 lines. A browser that supports DOM Level 3
JavaScript extensions can load XML files. The current versions
of Mozilla, Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer all support these extensions, and
the upcoming release of Konqueror will do so as well. The index is stored as a
set of XML files, and the JavaScript searches through these in
an efficient manner to generate results of a keyword search. These
results then can be posted back to the Web page that requested them, also using
JavaScript.
</p><p>
One of the key dependencies of jsFind is that a CD-ROM be a set of static
information. Unlike Web search engines or any other dynamic data set,
once pressed, a CD-ROM isn't going to change. SWISH-E is better
suited for dynamic indexing, especially when one has the luxury of
configuring a server to do the keyword searches. Therefore, jsFind is based on the
idea that the only thing available is a standard Web browser with
JavaScript and a set of browseable files&mdash;a severe restriction on possible
solutions.
</p><p>
Most indexing method algorithms try to strike a balance between
insert, update, delete and select times. Because a CD-ROM is static, there
will never be a delete or update. Insert takes place prior to CD burning and can
be quite time consuming. Select time is critical for user
responsiveness. An additional constraint of small space is required,
because
a typical CD-ROM can't hold more than 700MB.
</p><p>
Re-examining indexing methods based on these constraints yielded
an interesting solution: B-trees and hashes are the two most commonly
used indexing methods. I chose to use B-trees due to the fact that a filesystem
organizes files in a tree; this could be used to store
the structure of the B-tree, saving some precious space in the process.
Second, the key/link pairs could be analyzed, and a balanced B-tree
could be created. The structure of the XML files themselves was kept as
minimal as possible, so single-letter tags were used as a space-saving
move.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x272f7c0"></a>
Description of B-trees</h2></div></div><p>
A B-tree is a data structure used frequently in database indexing
and storage routines. It offers efficient search times, and storage/retrieval
is done in blocks that works well with current hardware.
A B-tree consists of nodes (or blocks) that have an ordered list of keys.
Each key references an associated data set. If a requested key falls between
two keys in the ordering, a reference is provided to another node of keys.
A balanced B-tree is one in which the maximum number of nodes that could
be loaded on a search stays at a minimum.
</p><p>
jsFind creates a B-tree by using XML files for the nodes of the tree, and
the directories on the filesystem correspond to references to another
set of nodes. This allows for part of the structure of the B-tree to be
encoded on the filesystem. If all the XML files are in the same directory,
file open times might become long, so using the filesystem efficiently
requires subdirectories.

Short Tutorial</h2></div></div><p>
End users need not worry about any of this. They simply can type words to
search for on a Web page, and jsFind returns links to pages
containing those keywords. No install, no worries, just a seamless
experience.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6932f2.large.jpg"><img src="6932f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Example Search Results
</p></div></div><p>
As a developer of content, however, your life is not so simple. The jsFind
toolset tries to make your job as easy as possible, though. To start,
you need Perl and a fair
amount of CPU time to generate the index. Most likely you also need a copy
of all the target browsers so you can test the results. An example
with a Makefile can be found in the jsFind distribution, but several steps need
to be tailored to your individual needs.
</p><p>
The first step is to get a data set consisting of keywords and links; the
input format needs to be XML. I used SWISH-E with a custom patch to extract
and create an index and then exported the results to the XML format suitable for processing
with jsFind's Perl scripts. Assuming the SWISH-E index is in the file
mystuff.index, the following command exports the file to XML:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ swish-e -f mystuff.index -T INDEX_XML &gt; mystuff.xml
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x272fea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The structure of this XML file is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;index&gt;
 &lt;word&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;akeywordhere&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;path freq="11" title="Something neat"&gt;
    /cdrom/blah.html
  &lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;path freq="10" title="More cool stuff"&gt;
    /cdrom/blah2.html
 &lt;/path&gt;
 &lt;/word&gt;
 &lt;word&gt;
 ...

&lt;/index&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x2730000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The XML file is sorted by order of keyword name.
</p><p>
The resulting data set still is probably too large, because SWISH-E
doesn't concern itself with filtering out words like &ldquo;and&rdquo;,
&ldquo;this&rdquo;
and other common English words. Two Perl programs can be used
to filter the result, occurrences.pl and filter.pl.
occurrences.pl creates a list of keywords and determines the number of
times they occur in an index:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ occurrences.pl mystuff.xml | sort -n -k 2 \
  &gt; mystuff.keys
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x2730268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This file has a keyword on each line followed by the number of
occurrences:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tail mystuff.keys
you 134910
for 138811
i 149471
in 168657
is 179815
of 252424
and 273283
a 299319
to 349069
the 646262
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, the mind-numbing task of creating a keyword exclusion file
is performed. Edit the key file and leave in all the words that should be
excluded from the final index. Even better than creating your
own file, get a copy of the
300 most common words in English from ZingMan at <a href="http://www.zingman.com/commonWords.html" target="_self">www.zingman.com/commonWords.html</a>.
</p><p>
Next, run the filter. The Perl script
filter.pl included in this package filters a result set.
It currently is set to exclude any single-character index keys
(except the letter C), any key that starts with two numeric digits
(so things like 3com and 0xe3 are okay) and anything in the specified
exclusion file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ filter.pl mystuff.xml mystuff.keys &gt; \
  mystuff-filtered.xml
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2637580.0x2730528"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This step takes quite a bit of time. Make
sure the final size of the file falls within the limits of the space available. The
final index should be about 75% of the size of the filtered index. If it's too
big, whittle it down to size with a longer keyword exclusion file.
</p><p>
The second big step is creating the index itself. A script is provided
to break this index down into a set of B-tree XML files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkindex.pl mystuff-filtered.xml 25
blocksize: 20
keycount: 101958
depth: 4
blockcount: 5098
maximum keys: 194480
fill ratio: 0.524259563965446
bottom fill: 92698
Working: 11%
</pre>
</p><p>
Parameters are the next thing to consider. The blockcount states
how many B-tree blocks need to be created. Each block creates
one key nodes file and one data nodes file, and one
directory. If the total number of files and directories is too high,
increase the
blocksize until it fits. The depth shows the number of levels in
the tree. If the blocksize gets too large, search times slow down, so
bottom fill is how it is kept balanced. Once that number of keys is put
in the bottom row, the bottom row is closed to further node creation,
thus creating a balanced tree.
</p><p>
If all works well, you should end up with three files
in the current directory: 0.xml, _0.xml and the directory 0.
These are the index files. The next step is to follow the provided example
for integrating the results into your HTML/JavaScript. The results then are passed to
a provided routine and need to be posted back to the current Web page. The example
does this using JavaScript to create dynamic HTML.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Many improvements to jsFind are possible, and they'll come as it is
used by open-source users. Such features as having an
image archive search with thumbnails, multipage result sets and stronger
browser compatibility checks all are possible using this code as a springboard.
</p><p>
The 2002 <i  >LJ</i> Archive CD-ROM
contains the jsFind search engine. If you're a
developer of CD-ROM content, please consider using
jsFind over solutions with proprietary OSes. Doing so will
be cheaper and will connect you with a larger potential
user base. As an end user, I hope to be delivered
from having to install a program and dual-boot
simply to search content on a CD-ROM.
Other innovative uses for the software might be possible as well,
so consider it to be one more tool in the open-source
toolbox.
