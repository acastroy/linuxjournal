The Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA)
overview in <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s August 2003 issue, &ldquo;Take
Control of TCPA&rdquo; written by Dave Safford, Jeff Kravitz
and Leendert van Doorn, discusses some of the
TCPA system's security features. The article does not
consider, however, that the remote attestation feature of
TCPA is likely to cause harm unless a simple fix
is applied.
</p><p>
TCPA's basic rationale is correct: today's PC architecture lacks
hardware features that would improve computer security. For instance,
current PCs have no secure key storage mechanism. If you keep your GPG
key on your computer, as most GPG users do, someone who breaks in
is able to read it from disk and copy it.
</p><p>
The PC also is vulnerable to keyloggers and screen-grabbers. An
attacker can watch you by installing code
to record what you type and can capture what appears on your monitor.
</p><p>
TCPA improves computer security by addressing these weaknesses with
corresponding hardware improvements. One of these, the secure key
storage mechanism described in &ldquo;Take Control of TCPA&rdquo;, lets you prevent
keys from being stolen, even in the case of a root compromise.
</p><p>
The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) also may develop hardware to defend
against software keyloggers and screen-grabbers and to support stronger
memory isolation than what exists in most popular operating systems today.
Even if your system is compromised, your data and communications still could
be protected. This approach would help programmers limit the
privilege of software, even operating systems&mdash;that's good security
design.
</p><p>
But trusted computing architects have gone astray in designing
&ldquo;system software integrity measurement&rdquo;, which Safford et al.
note &ldquo;can
be used to detect software compromise&rdquo;. The TCPA
software attestation mechanisms go beyond this; they're built to
enforce policies even against the wishes of the
computer owner.
</p><p>
Even as the attestation features prove <span   class="emphasis"><em>to you</em></span>
that your computer's software is unaltered, they also can be used to
prove <span   class="emphasis"><em>to a third party</em></span> that your computer's software is unaltered. If
you, as the computer owner, make a change, a third party
sees that the content of your attestation is different.
That's fine if the third party has your interests at
heart,
but computer owners and third parties with whom they interact
often have different interests.
</p><p>
Creating a reliable way for a
third party to determine what software you're using is a
pernicious project. Today, it's trivial to fool &ldquo;Internet Explorer
only&rdquo; sites: change how your browser identifies itself, and there is
nothing the other end can do.
With TCPA's remote attestation, a site that insists on an attestation
would receive the whole truth or a highly suspicious &ldquo;No
Comment&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Another casualty might be the software interoperability that we
currently take for granted. For example, today you can access Microsoft file
servers with a Samba client.
With a software attestation scheme that treats you as an adversary,
software publishers and service providers would have a remarkably
sophisticated toolset for locking out competition, forcing upgrades or
downgrades and deliberately breaking interoperability.
Software publishers could control their customers' backups or migration
paths or build monopoly power over after-market products and services.
That some will do so seems beyond dispute.
</p><p>
In the past, anticonsumer misfeatures and barriers to interoperability
were remedied by reverse engineering. But the TCPA security design
allows software publishers to hamper this practice severely. They can
create encrypted network protocols and file formats&mdash;with keys tucked
away in hardware rather than accessible in memory. Thus, the same security
features that protect your computer and its software against intruders
can be turned against you.
</p><p>
Fortunately, this problem is fixable. TCG should empower computer owners to
override attestations deliberately to defeat policies of which they
disapprove. Giving the owner this choice preserves an essential
part of the status quo: third parties can never know for sure what's running on
your PC. TCG already defines a platform owner concept. The TCG
specification also should provide for a facility by which the platform
owner, when physically present, can force the TPM chip to generate an
attestation as if the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) contained values of the owner's choice
instead of their actual values.
</p><p>
APIs and a clear user interface for the override
mechanism could be specified by an appropriate TCG committee. Only
the platform owner should be able to do this; whenever a machine
provides an inaccurate attestation, it does so for what its owner
considered an appropriate reason. This change would do nothing to
undermine the basic security benefits of the TCPA hardware, including
those outlined in the Safford article; <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> still could tell whether
your computer had been altered.
</p><p>
EFF (<a href="http://www.eff.org" target="_self">www.eff.org</a>) has been in regular contact with the TCG organization and its
members. So far, these companies have resisted the Owner Override idea.
We can use your help in the future to get them to fix trusted computing
so that it benefits computer owners.
