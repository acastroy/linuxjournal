    The good news brought by the announcement is that a lot of money
    is likely to
    be made using Linux as it penetrates the enterprise market and
    makes further gains as an Internet OS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e27580.0x1f1f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>On September 29, 1998 at ISPCON Fall '98
in San Jose, the computer industry was galvanized when Red Hat
Software announced that Intel, Netscape Communications and venture
capital firms Greylock and Benchmark Partners had taken minority
equity positions in the company. Red Hat further announced that
with the investment they would establish an Enterprise Computing
Division to offer enterprise-grade products and services for
support of global and mission-critical applications.
</p><p>The good news brought by the announcement is that a lot of
money is likely to be made using Linux as it penetrates the
enterprise market and makes further gains as an Internet OS.</p><p>The undisclosed size of the investments was not what caused
the excitement --it was the &ldquo;who&rdquo;. Intel was taking a direct,
financial interest in the fortunes of this upstart OS called Linux.
Everyone recognized this to be a major turning point. There could
be only one reason for Intel's interest in Linux&mdash;opportunity for
profit.</p><p>Only the week before, Intel's CEO Craig Barrett, speaking to
the British House of Commons, said that estimates of Internet world
trade by the year 2002 currently stood at between $450 billion and
$500 billion.</p><p>Linux has established itself as the leading Internet server
OS, capturing 27% of the market, while Windows NT has established a
reputation as notoriously unscalable and unstable. Because of the
unique leverage of its Open Source development model, Linux is also
rapidly becoming the dominant UNIX platform.</p><p>When Oracle, Informix, Computer Associates, Sybase and IBM
all invest in porting their products to Linux and Netscape
Communications invests both money and products in Linux, we can be
sure they see a major opportunity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e27580.0x1f1f608"></a>Any Bad News?</h2></div></div><p>Free software advocates have concerns about whether the entry
of big business may actually harm the movement. In particular,
buying a stake in only one Linux distribution may deepen already
existing divisions. All distributions use essentially the same
software; however, Intel's decision to buy into Red Hat amounts to
an endorsement that will give Red Hat a decided sales
advantage.</p><p>Another concern is that Intel may have a corrupting
influence. Considerable resentment has already been aroused with
the proprietary Intel-endorsed I2O specification. Will comparable
adulterations be introduced into the products Intel helps Red Hat
produce?</p><p>To weigh these concerns, we must consider that advocates have
been trying for years to get free software accepted. Enterprise is
now asking for Linux, but Linux is not ready. Many free software
projects are struggling to produce a product with volunteer help.
When we wanted free software, it seemed only logical that we invest
our time and energy to create it. Now that enterprise wants free
software, it is just as logical for enterprise to make whatever
investment is required to create the products it wants.</p><p>This is a challenging and pivotal time for free software.
Publicly held corporations do not have a moral imperative to
protect the spirit of free software but only to bring the greatest
return to their shareholders. Many of the free software licenses
offer no protection against turning free into proprietary software.
Of the Open Source licenses most often used, the GPL offers the
most protection that the source code, its distribution and the
products derived from it will stay free. Linux and the most
essential software development tools are protected by the GPL.
Therefore, we need not fear the entry of big business into free
software.</p><p>Red Hat is deeply committed to the free software movement.
There is little possibility that Red Hat will begin producing
proprietary products with Intel's money.</p><p>This investment should result in more widely deployed free
software. The concern that Red Hat is gaining an unfair advantage
over other distributions will prove unfounded when it gives the
software it develops back to the free software community. This good
will most certainly offset current concerns.</p><p>Red Hat has shown itself well deserving of the opportunity
this investment gives them to lead Linux into the
enterprise.</p><p><a href="3171s1.html" target="_self">Quotes</a></p></div></div>
