    The smtpd package is a useful mail daemon for stopping spam,
    thereby saving money and resources.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbd4348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Internet has been around since the
1970s with people using it mainly for electronic mail (e-mail).
This is still true even today as we see increasing numbers of
multimedia-based applications on the Internet. People still use
e-mail more than web browsers and file transfer programs. The
reason is simple&mdash;it is a low-cost yet effective method for
communicating with others all over the world. More and more people
are getting onto the Internet, and the first thing they do is get
an e-mail address.
</p><p>Realizing this, certain individuals and even organizations
have taken the opportunity to send unsolicited e-mail to Internet
users. Most of this mail is commercial advertising. They send
thousands of copies of the same message to a list of e-mail
addresses obtained from either Usenet postings or companies' home
pages. Such action is called spamming.</p><p>The consequence of spam is that the receiver ends up paying
for the cost of the e-mail, since the ISP (Internet Service
Provider) usually charges on the basis of connect time and
downloading mail takes time. At companies where each employee has
an e-mail address and the company has a fixed line for e-mail, that
line can become quite expensive if it is targeted by
spammers.</p><p>To hide their identity, spammers usually send from a forged
e-mail address and use mail servers that have not been configured
to prevent such activities. Relaying, as it is usually called, will
cause the targeted e-mail server to send mail on behalf of the
spammer to hundreds or even thousands of users. Spamming can
seriously affect the performance of the mail server and cause
massive bandwidth loss for the company affected. Not only will the
mail server's performance be affected, but recipients of the spam
will be given the impression that the company is in business with
the spammer.</p><p>For more information on this, visit the number one anti-spam
site on the Internet at http://spam.abuse.net/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbd45b0"></a>The smtpd Package</h2></div></div><p>My company was recently the target of a spammer who used our
mail server as a relay. The spammer was using an account from a
well-known service provider, and my guess is that it was probably a
trial account. I had not installed any preventions against such
attacks and was thus targeted. When I discovered the attack, I
dropped all my current work and began searching for a solution. I
started by looking at the Sendmail home page
(http://www.sendmail.org/). It had links that led to more tools and
tips for spam prevention. I chose to implement the solution based
on the <span   class="bold"><b>smtpd</b></span> package from Obtuse
Systems Corporation for the following reasons:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>smptd</b></span> is a small
package with only two executable files to manage and one
configuration file to tweak.</p></li><li><p>It works nicely with my mail server (Sendmail
v8.8.8).</p></li><li><p>The configuration file is very flexible and easy to
configure.</p></li></ol></div><p>As of this writing, the smtpd package is at version 2.0 and
can be obtained from
ftp://ftp.obtuse.com/pub/smtpd/smtpd-2.0.tar.gz.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>smtpd</b></span> works with other MTAs
(Mail Transport Agent), but I have been using only Sendmail. The
latest Sendmail can be retrieved from
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/ucb/src/sendmail/sendmail.8.9.1.tar.gz.</p><p>Note that you must have a working MTA before installing
smtpd. It acts only as a mail proxy, storing and forwarding mail to
other MTAs for the actual delivery.</p><p>Briefly, here's how smtpd works: the smtpd daemon runs and
accepts mail instead of your regular mail server. It accepts mail
from the Internet as well as your own domain.
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpd</b></span> can be configured to reject
mail based on several criteria:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>IP address of the sender</p></li><li><p>Host name or domain of sender</p></li><li><p>E-mail address of sender</p></li><li><p>E-mail address of receiver</p></li></ol></div><p>Based on the configuration file, the mail is either rejected
or accepted and spooled. The second program,
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpfwdd</b></span>, will do the actual
forwarding of the spooled mail to the MTA (Sendmail in this case).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xbd4fa8"></a>Compiling and Installing the Package</h2></div></div><p>Once you've obtained the package, unarchive the files to a
directory. Assuming the files are to be put in the directory
/usr/src/smtpd-2.0, do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src
tar xvzf ~/smtpd-2.0.tar.gz
cd smtpd-2.0
</pre><p>Now, by typing <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>, you'll
see many files and subdirectories. Be sure to read README and
INSTALL as these files contain valuable information on the
installation of the mail proxy.
</p><p>To compile the package, do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Choose a user and group for running the smtpd
daemon. Your choice must be defined as a trusted user in the
sendmail.cf file. I chose to use the user
<b  >daemon</b>. If you are not sure what to use as
trusted user, check the /etc/sendmail.cf file for lines like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Trusted users #
Troot
Tdaemon
Tuucp
</pre>


In this example, the trusted users are <b  >root</b>,
<b  >daemon</b> and <b  >uucp</b>. Do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use <b  >root</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpd</b></span> works without any root
privileges; thus, it is more secure to run it as some other
user.</p></li><li><p>Create a directory in which smtpd can store spooled
mail before smtpfwdd processes it. Change permissions and also the
user/group of that directory so only that user has full rights to
it. If you put it in the /home/smtpd/spool directory, execute these
commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /home/smtpd
mkdir /home/smtpd/spool
chown -R daemon.daemon /home/smtpd
chmod 700 /home/smtpd
ls -lad /home/smtpd
</pre>


The output from <b  >ls</b> will look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
drwx------ 3 daemon daemon 1024 Mar 26 01:34
 /home/smtpd/
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Edit the Makefile in the source directory to
reflect your choice. The changes we need to make for our example
are as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SMTP_USER = daemon
SMTP_GROUP = daemon
SPOOLDIR = /home/smtpd
SPOOLSUBDIR = /spool
EHLO_KLUDGE=1
JUNIPER_SUPPORT=0
#LD_LIBS=-lresolv
CHECK_IDENT = 0
</pre>


<b  >EHLO_KLUDGE</b> is needed to fix a bug in Netscape
Communicator. <b  >JUNIPER_SUPPORT</b> is set to 0 unless
you're using Obtuse's Firewall Kernel. <b  >LD_LIBS</b>
is commented out, as my Linux distribution does not require the
external library libresolv. <b  >CHECK_IDENT</b> has been
set to 0 to disable IDENT checking. I personally do not believe in
IDENT checks&mdash;they take time and do not return any useful
information.
</p><p>By default, the Makefile has been configured to be compiled
on Linux, so no other changes need to be made.</p></li><li><p>In the source directory, type
<b  >make</b> to compile smtpd and smtpfwdd.</p></li><li><p>Once the compilation is finished, you will find two
executable files in the directory. Copy them to another location in
your PATH. To copy them to the /usr/local/sbin directory, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp smtpd /usr/local/sbin
cp smtpfwdd /usr/local/sbin
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Create a few subdirectories under the /home/smtpd/
directory by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/smtpd
mkdir etc usr
mkdir usr/lib
mkdir usr/lib/zoneinfo
</pre>


Because smtpd does a <span   class="bold"><b>chroot</b></span> to the
directory /home/smtpd, we need to copy (or make symbolic links)
into this directory some files that are required for the proper
execution of smtpd/smtpfwdd. The files and the directory in which
each should be located are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/resolv.conf <b  >-&gt;</b>
/home/smtpd/etc/resolv.conf</p></li><li><p>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime
<b  >-&gt;</b>
/home/smtpd/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>The file resolv.conf is needed so that smtpd can do DNS
queries (look up IP addresses of hosts). The file localtime has
your time zone setting and is required to put the proper time stamp
on e-mail. The location of localtime may be different on your
system, so you'll have to find the exact path and create a
duplicate under the /home/smtpd directory.</p></li><li><p>Configure smtpd and smtpfwdd to replace the running
mail server.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xfce380"></a>Configuring smtpd</h2></div></div><p>The mail proxy reads its configuration from a file
(smtpd_check_rules) in the /etc directory, in our example,
/home/smtpd/etc/smtpd_check_rules. Each line in the file beginning
with a # is a comment. Blank lines are allowed. Rules have the
following format (one line):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[allow|deny|noto]:<span   class="emphasis"><em>SourceList</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>FromList</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>ToList</em></span>[:<span   class="emphasis"><em>XXX message</em></span>]
</pre><p>where XXX is the error message number. The first rule that
matches will be taken and the check ended, so placement of rules
should be done carefully.
</p><p>The first field states the action to either allow an SMTP
connection, deny the SMTP connection and close the session or
<span   class="bold"><b>noto</b></span> which will return an error
for the matching rule but will still continue for the
session.</p><p>The second field is a list of IP addresses and/or host names
to match the source SMTP connection. IP addresses may be specified
with a netmask to include a whole network. The format of this is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>XX.XX.XX.XX/bits</em></span> where bits is the netmask
bits for the network. For instance, a network 192.168.0.0 with
netmask 255.255.255.0 would be written as 192.168.0.0/24. A few
special reserved identifiers that can be used are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >ALL</b>: any IP address and host
name</p></li><li><p><b  >KNOWN</b>: only IP and host names
which are DNS resolvable</p></li><li><p><b  >UNKNOWN</b>: IP and host names which
are not DNS resolvable</p></li><li><p><b  >EXCEPT</b>: exceptions</p></li><li><p><b  >*</b>: wild-card character</p></li></ul></div><p>The third and fourth fields are used to match e-mail
addresses and have the format user@host. The special word
<b  >ALL</b> can also be used in these fields.
</p><p>The fifth field is optional and is used to return error
messages from <span   class="bold"><b>deny</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>noto</b></span> to the SMTP client. The
following special variables can be used to return information in
the error messages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >%F</b>: mail from address</p></li><li><p><b  >%T</b>: recipient address</p></li><li><p><b  >%H</b>: connecting host name</p></li><li><p><b  >%I</b>: connecting IP address</p></li><li><p><b  >%U</b>: user from the host</p></li></ul></div><p>All three fields (<b  >SourceList</b>,
<b  >FromList</b> and <b  >ToList</b>) must be
matched in order for action to be taken.
</p><p><a href="2948l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is an example of a
set of rules that assumes the internal network is 10.0.0.0 and a
mail hub is at 10.0.0.9. Note that <b  >noto_delay</b>
will pause for a certain amount of seconds before action is taken.
This option was introduced to delay relayers and spammers and the
parameters that control this timeout are set in the
Makefile:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NOTO_DELAY = 60
DENY_DELAY = 60
</pre><p>A few other configurations can be done that I have not shown
here, namely the <b  >NS=</b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern-check</em></span> and the use of the IDENT
protocol for identifying users. Users who need a more detailed
setup of this file should read the file smtpd_address_check.txt in
the source directory. Examples for filtering spams and relays can
be downloaded from Obtuse's FTP site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xfcf878"></a>Running smtpd</h2></div></div><p>After creating the configuration file, the running mail
daemon must be stopped and replaced with smtpd/smtpfwdd. For
Sendmail, this can be done by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ps ax | grep sendmail
24569 ? S 0:00 sendmail: accepting connections on port 25
&gt; kill 24569
</pre><p>This will effectively shutdown the mail daemon. Now, check
for queued mail that the daemon has not yet sent out by issuing the
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/lib/sendmail -bp
</pre>


If the mail queue is not empty, flush the queue by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/lib/sendmail -q
</pre>


If mail is still in the queue after awhile, this command can be
resent at a later time so the installation of smtpd/smtpfwdd can
continue. No new mail will be accepted while the mail daemon is
down.
</p><p>Start the smtpd daemon by issuing the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/sbin/smtpd -c /home/smtpd -d /spool\
-u daemon -g daemon -D
-L
</pre><p>The smtpd daemon will start accepting mail and spool it to
the /home/smtpd/spool directory. The parameters on the command line
are defined as follows:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >-c /home/smtpd</b>: the smtpd home
directory</p></li><li><p><b  >-d /spool</b>: the directory where
spooled mail should be stored</p></li><li><p><b  >-u daemon -g daemon</b>: user/group
smtpd</p></li><li><p><b  >-D</b>: instruction to run as daemon
and listen on the SMTP port</p></li><li><p><b  >-L</b>: instruction to suppress
children in daemon mode from making an
<span   class="bold"><b>openlog</b></span> call</p></li></ul></div>

Once smtpd is running, check the directory&mdash;it will be full of
files with the prefix <span   class="bold"><b>smtp</b></span>. These
files are the spooled mail messages and need to be processed by the
MTA. This is the job of smtpfwdd. We run smtpfwdd by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/sbin/smtpfwdd -d /home/smtpd/spool -u\
daemon -g daemon
</pre>


Once it begins running, smtpfwdd will check the spool directory
/home/smtpd/spool and starts processing the spooled mail by running
the MTA, in this case Sendmail.
</p><p>A good idea is to run the MTA in such a way that it
periodically processes its mail queue and sends out any mail
present. Note that we actually have two spool directories here: one
used by smtpd and the other by sendmail (usually in
/var/spool/mqueue). To run sendmail in non-daemon mode in order to
process the queue every 15 minutes, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/lib/sendmail -q15m
</pre><p>Once everything is running fine, edit your startup files to
run smtpd/smtpfwdd by default instead of sendmail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xadc580.0xee0c88"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The Internet is no longer the &ldquo;friendly global village&rdquo; we
once thought it was. Living among the netizens are unscrupulous
individuals and even companies that take advantage of the openness
of the Internet for their own benefit while making others bear the
cost. We must take preventive measures against these attacks if we
want to avoid becoming victims. Proper policy on the e-mail server
will help to ensure this. With smtpd in place, you will have more
control of your e-mail server.</p></div></div>
