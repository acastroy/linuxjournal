teaching problem I have. Wave motion of all types, including those
on the surface of a body of water, can be decomposed into trains of
sinusoidal waves which propagate at different speeds and
amplitudes. If the frequencies of these waves are similar, the wave
motion is characterized by wave groups. In the simplest case of a
wave group, take two waves that propagate at nearly the same speed,
while the group they create by superposition travels at a different
speed (depending on water depth for water waves). Now, how do you
clearly present this concept to a class?
</p><p>Or, on the other hand, what happens when the two wave trains
are traveling in opposite directions? Is there a wave group? If the
two oppositely directed wave trains have the same frequency, a
standing wave system results with no propagation of energy. How do
you conveniently introduce these latter variations on the same
theme?</p><p>Finally, what happens when more wave trains are added or when
a wave group reflects back onto itself?</p><p>The traditional method of explaining these ideas to a class
is to take chalk in hand and draw pictures illustrating the
concepts. These pictures, however carefully drawn, are static and
fail to transmit the idea that the waves and wave groups are
dynamic entities, moving at different speeds and superimposing to
create the resulting wave forms.</p><p>An alternate method is to use a graphical computer program,
allowing students to see the result of superimposing wave trains
with any frequencies, amplitudes and directions they wish. By
trying different combinations of wave amplitudes, directions and
wave periods, students can empirically discover the behavior of the
water surface. Also, by allowing them to see the separate wave
component waves, it is clear, for example, that a standing wave is
comprised of two oppositely directed progressive wave
trains.</p><p>The graphical program I use to demonstrate this concept and
more than a dozen others was developed with Java on my Linux
computer. By writing these programs as applets, they are available
via the Internet to students with a Java-enabled browser
(preferably Netscape Navigator), to use in classroom instruction,
or for anyone who is curious about waves and coastal
processes.</p><p><a href="2554f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. The

professor develops the notes for a course. A textbook is often used
to provide either a structure to the course material or to augment
the professor's lectures. These textbooks thus provide a passive
means of utilizing the expertise of another individual to augment
the professor's own knowledge, or they contain a desirable format
or outline for presenting the material. However, the textbook
forces the instructor to adopt most, if not all, of the author's
style or approach to a subject. A major financial commitment is
made by the students, who must invest in one or more texts.</p><p>Java and the Internet provide another avenue of utilizing
other pedagogies without making a large investment of time or money
in someone else's approach. In addition, the applets can provide
useful graphical and computational tools.</p><p>The applets discussed here are provided on the Internet
(address given in the following section) and are used by a number
of other professors around the world to augment classroom
instruction as homework, and as laboratory experiments for courses
in water wave theory and coastal processes. They were written to
support two graduate courses taught at the University of Delaware.
Each applet illustrates a single concept, such as the particle
motions and velocities under a wave of the user's choice. By typing
in new data, the user can explore different scenarios, such as the
nonlinear influence of wave height on water wave speed (Stream
Function Wave Theory applet).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c0580.0x27b89d0"></a>Java and the Applets</h2></div></div><p>Using Java-enabled web browsers, these programs can be run
locally by accessing my web site that hosts the applet code. As an
alternative, these programs can also be provided as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>applications</em></span>, which run locally on the user's
machine equipped with Java&mdash;especially easy for Linux machines that
recognize Java byte code.</p><p>My contribution is the Java Applets for Coastal Engineering
site that I have developed. This web site provides Java applets
which can assist in the teaching of water waves and coastal
processes and provide useful tools for others. The applets are
hosted at http://www.coastal.udel.edu/faculty/rad/ on my Coastal
Engineering Java Page. The index.html page at this URL lists the
titles of the applets, a terse description of their purposes, and
dates that indicate when the Java code for the applet and the HTML
page was last modified. Clicking on an applet title on the list
results in the applet running on the user's computer. The applet
generally consists of several graphical windows: the first allows
the user to input data to the applet and the second shows the
results of the computation. In addition, HTML text associated with
the applet provides a description of the use of the applet, the
concepts it illustrates, and some idea of this theory in the Java
program.</p><p>Once compiled, all the program elements become separate code
segments, referred to as classes. These elements have been
converted by the compiler into machine-independent byte code, which
is downloaded by clicking on the applet's name on the Coastal
Engineering Java Page. The user's browser converts the byte code
into a local version of the applet, which then runs on his/her
machine. The load on my machine is the downloading of the byte
code.</p><p>While the web site is hosted by a Sun workstation, the
programming and debugging was done with a PC running Linux and the
Linux port of Java. The site, http://www.blackdown.org/, has the
latest information on the Linux port of Java, an HTML version of
the Java-Linux HOW-TO and a list of mirror sites for downloading
the Java Development Kit (now JDK 1.1.5). Another reference is the
October 1996 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
(http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue30/), which had a number of
articles on Java.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c0580.0x27b8c90"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>As this project has developed, the applets have evolved, in
part due to user comments and suggestions. The HTML page for each
applet has a <b  >mailto:</b> tag to allow the user to
send e-mail directly to me. Also, I have learned new Java tricks
and thought of improvements. So, the code-change dates are provided
on the index page. Future improvements will include homework-type
problems with each applet.</p><p>After several months of hosting the applets, it became clear
that some academic programs were being hampered by long download
times in using the applets over the Internet. I now provide an
archive file created with <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>
containing all the source code and HTML pages, so that the Java
programs can be run locally at other universities. This tar file
contains a Makefile, which provides a convenient way for the system
administrator to compile all the source code at once. After
installation, the local user points a web browser at the directory
containing the applets and then proceeds in the same way as the
user on the Internet, but faster. If you want to try this or see
the source code, the anonymous FTP site is www.coastal.udel.edu and
the file javapp.tar.Z is in the /pub/programs directory.</p><p>I could improve access speed for the Internet user in a
couple of ways. For each applet, I could compress all the class
files for a particular applet into a single zip file, reducing the
number of times the downloading browser has to connect with my
machine. (For Internet Explorer users, the files would need to be
in CAB format.) Another option would be to move to the Java bean
model. The problem with this solution is that the language is
evolving rapidly, so the applets would also have to evolve.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c0580.0x27b8ef8"></a>Implications</h2></div></div><p>I view the pedagogical advantages of applets such as these to
be paramount and potentially leading to large changes in the way
education material is delivered (until the next more convenient
tool comes along). Another major implication deals with free
delivery of course content. What is the motivation for people to
provide these programs and what is the benefit to their
institutions, particularly if there is a reduced need for
textbooks?</p><p>Several scenarios may play out in the future. Free course
content may soon dominate the Internet. This would follow the model
of the Linux operating system and other free software packages.
What do the developers get? Recognition. What do the institutions
get? The same as they now get with textbooks&mdash;recognition.
Alternatively, the advent of methods to bill small amounts of money
safely over the Internet might permit such sites to charge for each
use. This will most likely happen for sites that deliver an entire
course on-line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c0580.0x27b9058"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Java offers a new and flexible way to provide active
educational content to augment classroom instruction, both for the
local institution and institutions everywhere. Through the Internet
or local downloads of applets or applications, the examples
developed by one instructor can be shared by all.</p><p><a href="2554s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
