system. Through the shell, a user can type commands for file
maintenance, launch various application programs, and automate
tedious day-to-day system administration. Some computer systems
(such as Windows 95) don't come with a shell, but Linux includes a
multitude. Most Linux systems have csh, sh, tcsh, ksh and bash
pre-installed. <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> seems to have
become the standard shell for Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>, an acronym for
&ldquo;Bourne again shell&rdquo;, is a large, complicated and powerful
program. It has been developed over many years and is intended as
the standard shell for GNU systems. The GNU distributions of bash
come with a manual page and info-style documentation. If you are
familiar with UNIX shell programming, then those will probably be
all you need to get bash to do what you want. On the other hand, if
you've read the man pages a few times and are still scratching your
head, you may need more help.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Bash Shell</em></span>, as the authors
summarize in their preface, &ldquo;is designed to address casual UNIX
and Linux users who are just above the raw beginner level. You
should be familiar with the process of logging in, entering
commands, and doing some simple things with files.&rdquo; After reading
the book a few times, I agree; however, the usefulness of this book
goes beyond simply being a beginner's tutorial. If you haven't
earned all the stars on your UNIX-wizard cap, you will find it an
often-used reference.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Bash Shell</em></span> is a 320-page
book divided into eleven chapters, five appendices and an index. It
is written in an easy-to-follow style which avoids, as much as
possible, the terse style of man pages and jargon. The layout and
typesetting make it easy to navigate though the various
explanations and examples.</p><p>The first three chapters give an overview of the functions of
a shell, the extensive command-line editing capabilities of bash
and the setting up of a customized environment. The section on
command-line editing is one I will read a few more times&mdash;the more
I understand and begin to use bash's power, the less typing I do.
Considering the state of my typing ability, this is a Good
Thing.</p><p>The next five chapters are certainly the most valuable&mdash;they
deal with actually programming bash. All the command words,
variables and built-in functions are covered. Much of this expands
on material in the man/info documentation, with additional comments
on when you might want to use a particular command, its history,
and in some cases the suggestion that you may never need to use it.
Furthermore, most of the explanations are accompanied by examples
showing exactly how and when to use the command and its arguments.
In good pedagogical style, the authors present a simple example;
then, as the reader learns more features, the examples are
revisited and expanded until one has a useful and solid shell
program. Suggested exercises are included for the reader to work on
in order to improve programming skills.</p><p>If you've done any programming, you know about the tedious
chore of tracking down bugs in your programs. Writing scripts in
bash is no different&mdash;you will have bugs, and sometimes they will
be hard to find. Actually, with the arcane syntax of shell scripts,
they may be very hard to find. Chapter nine will help. The standard
debugging methods (lots and lots of print statements) are covered,
and an extensive debugger is presented by the author. The most
interesting part of the debugger is that it is actually a bash
script&mdash;neat.</p><p>The final two chapters deal with the rather mundane topics of
installing bash as your user shell, some security issues, and
obtaining and installing bash on your own system. Fortunately,
since bash comes pre-installed as the standard shell on most Linux
systems, this section can be skimmed through.</p><p>The five appendices contain the expected reference lists, BNF
(Barkus-Naur Form) syntax, etc.&mdash;good, useful information. Finally,
the 14-page index makes it easy to use the book as a standard
desktop reference.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Bash Shell</em></span> was written for
the 2.x version of bash; however, any features which are not
supported by earlier versions of bash are noted.</p><p>Programming in a shell language like bash is quite different
from using a high-level language like C. To me, it seems that bash
has been kludged together by a large number of individuals who,
when adding needed features, merged their preferred syntax into the
shell language. The result is that the bash language can be rather
convoluted, and it is easy for a beginner to get bogged down in
details. For this reason alone, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Bash
Shell</em></span> is an important tool. Be aware that writing shell
scripts, especially if you have root permissions, can be dangerous
to the health of your system. Fortunately, the authors warn you
when their examples can compromise system integrity or
security.</p><p>The examples are short enough for the user to type in, and
also available from O'Reilly's FTP site&mdash;well, the authors state
they are. I followed the instructions in the book and downloaded
the source file. Unfortunately, the file is for the first edition
of the book and misses the entire debug script. I contacted
O'Reilly by e-mail and received a courteous and timely reply
advising me that they would contact the book editor to track down
the source. Perhaps by the time this review is in print, the
correct source will be available.</p><p>We have learned to expect professional, well-written,
technically correct books from O'Reilly, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning The
Bash Shell</em></span> is no exception. Writing technical reference
books is always a difficult task. It is even more trying when the
knowledge base of the intended audience is as varied as the book's
potential readers. I think the authors have succeeded in making
both an introductory primer for new users and a valuable reference
for the more experienced. I highly recommend this book to anyone
who wants to become more productive using bash, as well as those
who wish to learn to write moderately complex shell scripts.</p></div></div>
