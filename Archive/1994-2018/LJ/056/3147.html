keyboard designed specifically with programmers in mind. While not
a single bit of fuzz is actually on the keyboard, its size makes it
cute, if not disorienting, to people used to the standard IBM PC
keyboard.

</p><p>According to PFU America, the keyboard's design makes it
easier for programmers to reach the keys they want quickly and
efficiently. They claim having fewer keys on the keyboard increases
efficiency by preventing users from overextending their fingers on
certain keystrokes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e58a28"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The Happy Hacking Keyboard arrived in a tiny box shortly
after I agreed to do a review of the product. Inside were the
keyboard and three cables (for a PS/2, Macintosh and Sun computer)
along with the usual manual and warranty information.</p><p>PFU America recently changed the package, and lowered the
price. The Happy Hacking Keyboard now comes with only one cable (of
the customer's choice), but additional cables are available for
$35.00 each. The cables are expensive because they are handmade by
the people at PFU America.</p><p>The manual was fairly straightforward&mdash;after all, almost
everyone knows how to hook up a keyboard. However, with the many
cables that accompanied the keyboard, it was comforting to know
that documentation was available should it be needed.</p><p>After the computer was powered down, I said goodbye to my 101
Enhanced keyboard and hello to blissful days of Happy Hacking. Or
so I thought&mdash;I had to grab a PS/2 to AT keyboard adapter
first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e58c38"></a>Life is a Series of Adjustments</h2></div></div><p>The keyboard is streamlined, containing only 60 keys. A
function key is included that can be used in combination with other
keys; as a result, awkward finger positioning is sometimes
required. My first days using the keyboard reminded me of playing
Twister and trying to reach the red dot by squeezing my arm past
two opponents while keeping my feet on the orange and blue dots on
opposite sides of the mat. In fact, two weeks later, I was still
finding myself reverting to my old PC keyboarding habits. Some
complex key sequences were hard to complete correctly, as old
habits die hard.</p><p>Also, in the beginning, the backspace key didn't work;
however, this turned out to be primarily my fault. Being lazy and
excited to test out the new keyboard, I refrained from reading all
the way through the manual to the final (third) page where a table
and accompanying figure would have taught me how to program the
keyboard using a slider switch. Eventually, I toggled the switch
and had the backspace key working to my satisfaction.</p><p>Since I started using Linux before Windows 95 was introduced
(I stopped using MS products long before that), I did not miss the
extra &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; keys found on most PC keyboards. I did, however,
have to get used to console cruising with the new keyboard.
Switching from X to the console requires a four finger/key
combination (<b  >ctrl-alt-fn-f*</b>, where fn is the
function key), while cruising through consoles requires a three
finger/key combination
(<b  >alt-fn-<i><tt>arrow-key</tt></i></b>).</p><p>Even in a non-<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>-type editor
without command mode movement keys, the Happy Hacking Keyboard
makes the user adjust to finding the location of the arrow pad and
remembering to hit the function key. In all fairness, it took me
less than a week to become oriented with the key locations. (It
does remain comical to watch others try to wander through the key
selections for the first time.)</p><p>Unlike a laptop, the size and shape of the keys are the same
as on a PC keyboard, making it easier to adjust. I never overreach
the true location of the keys and don't have a difficult time
typing something on other people's computers (who don't have a
Happy Hacking Keyboard). However, I am now known to complain about
how &ldquo;weird&rdquo; other keyboards are.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e59000"></a>Happy Hacking</h2></div></div><p>While the keyboard did not cure me of my sarcastic nature, I
did find the escape key much easier to reach since it's located to
the immediate left of the &ldquo;1&rdquo; key. In vi, I can quickly switch
out of insert mode since I never have to look down to relocate the
escape key or reposition my fingers afterwards; thus, cruising
through vi has become even easier.</p><p>For XEmacs programming, the control key is located in the
&ldquo;right&rdquo; place, directly left of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; key. This makes it easy
to use without any odd movements or taking your fingers away from
the home row. (Yes, I learned to type before I learned to
program.)</p><p>Both of these key locations, escape and control, have allowed
me to quickly negotiate commands without having to reposition my
fingers. This has the benefit of reducing the frustration of trying
to return to the home keys after each command&mdash;my fingers never
wind up in odd locations as they did on a typical PC
keyboard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e591b8"></a>Disgruntled Gamer</h2></div></div><p>As a part-time game player (Linux Quake), I'm accustomed to
using the keyboard for all player movements, such as turns and
running. With this keyboard, I'd have to hold the function key down
constantly (to select the arrow keys) or figure out how to use the
mouse. Otherwise, keeping the function key depressed (two keys away
from the arrow keys) and trying to fumble around with the arrows
might increase the probability of developing carpal tunnel
syndrome.</p><p>After a few games of Quake, I think I'll be comfortable with
the bizarre fingering required. Also, using the keyboard to program
in XEmacs helped in the adjustment needed to get into the gaming
world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e59318"></a>Technical Support and On-line
Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Documentation is also available on-line. While I haven't had
to use their tech support e-mail, it is readily available&mdash;my
contact at PFU America was quick to reply to any e-mail I sent.
Furthermore, all of the information needed to install and hook up
the keyboard can be found on-line. All of the information in the
manual is included in their on-line documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d60580.0x1e59420"></a>In Closing</h2></div></div><p>Overall, I would be hard-pressed to sum up this review with
anything but a positive remark. With the price tag recently
dropping by $40, the keyboard is more affordable. I'm sure other
hackers will be quite happy to own it.</p><p>For someone who hasn't experienced the keyboard, it's hard to
believe everything reported about the Happy Hacking Keyboard by PFU
America. In fact, I was skeptical about the remarks I had heard
before I became a Happy Hacking Keyboard user. Now, one month after
laying my fingers on it, I can't imagine using any other keyboard.
I wonder if PFU America makes a Happy Hacking tote bag.</p></div></div>
