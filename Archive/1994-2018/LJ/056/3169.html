however, the SMTP mailer (Sendmail) and the POP3 mailer clash to
the extent that some mail is coming into Netscape and some is going
to Sendmail, accessed via
<span   class="bold"><b>elm</b></span>.</p><p>I would like all mail to go through Netscape (POP3) via the
ISP. How do I stop Sendmail or halt it? Thanks in advance for any
help. &mdash;Bill Lunnon, bill@mirrim.demon.co.uk</p><p>Sendmail is most likely sending out mail using your
full host name. When a recipient replies to a message you sent from
elm, the reply is sent directly to your computer and not to your
mailbox at your ISP. The easiest workaround is to set
the <b  >Reply-to:</b> field in
Netscape's mail preferences to your correct e-mail address. A
better solution is to edit the /etc/sendmail.cf file to set the
domain Sendmail masquerades as. This will exclude your host name
from mail sent out using Sendmail. &mdash;Peter Struijk,

systems under the /home directory (I have a number of user accounts
here), so I restored /home using a
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> backup file. Ever since then,
I have not been able to get information when running various things
like <span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>whoami</b></span>.</p><p>When I do whoami, I get the following message instead of the
alias name: &ldquo;<b  >whoami: cannot find user name for UID
500</b>&rdquo; where I used to see <b  >grb</b>. When I
do a finger while logged on as myself or another user, I get this
message: &ldquo;<b  >No one logged on</b>&rdquo; instead of a list
of users logged onto the system.</p><p>When I type the command <b  >ls -al</b>, I get the
user ID number and group ID number instead of the login name: e.g.,
instead of user and group ID both being <b  >grb</b>,
they have the value <b  >500</b>, which is correct
according to what I assigned when originally setting up the
accounts. However, I used to see the alias names.</p><p>I cannot get the Caldera Desktop to run while logged in as
any user, and before, everything ran just fine. When running the
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> program&mdash;it tries to
initialize and I even see a color background&mdash;the server bombs and
goes back to the /dev/tty screen. Looking at the Xerror logs
doesn't give me any information as to why it is now failing.</p><p>I can still start a customized X session with a TWM-type
desktop while running the XwinPro PC X package on my PC. I can also
run programs on the client X server with no problem. I am at a loss
as to what to do to get the system restored or corrected at this
point. Can you offer an explanation and a possible fix to this
problem? Thank you in advance for any help you may offer. &mdash;George
R. Boyko, grb99@nni.com</p><p>These symptoms sound a lot like problems with permissions.
This crops up sometimes when you restore with
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>. If you do not set your umask
to 0 before doing the restore, then tar will obey the current umask
when restoring files. In addition, tar finalizes permissions at the
end of the restore process. So, it is possible to end up with
incorrect ownership or permissions if the restore is interrupted
before completion. If you restored /home by doing a full backup and
then stopping it once /home had been restored, you could end up
with home directories or other files with wrong ownership or
permission bits.</p><p>To fix your problem, you will have to check that
all of the directories in /home are owned by their proper owners
and that the permissions give at least user read and write.
Use <b  >chmod -R</b> and
<b  >chown -R</b> to recursively change
permissions or ownership of directories.</p><p>You should also check the /etc/passwd and the
/etc/group files to be sure they are world-readable
(<b  >chmod a+r</b>). If they are
not, this would explain the problem with ls reporting UID instead
of name. Also, verify that the files /var/log/wtmp and
/var/run/utmp are world-readable as well. If they are not, this
would explain the problem with finger.</p><p>As for the Caldera Desktop and X, that could be a problem
with the permissions of /tmp or /var/tmp. Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod a+rwxt /tmp /var/tmp
</pre><p>to set proper permissions (world read-write,
sticky) on those directories. &mdash;Bob Huack,

type the word &ldquo;single&rdquo; at the LILO prompt. This would immediately
drop me into the system as root. It was extremely useful when
something wasn't working. Recently I had a need for it, and it
didn't work.</p><p>Did it truly go away? If so, when and why? How can I put it
back? Is there some way of specifying the runlevel from LILO?  &mdash;Walt
Stoneburner, wls@wls.wwco.com</p><p>Try using
<b  >linux&nbsp;single</b>. If your default
boot configuration in /etc/lilo.conf is not named
<b  >linux</b>, substitute the proper
label.</p><p>Similarly, you can specify the runlevel from the
boot prompt with <b  >linux&nbsp;N</b>,
where <b  >N</b> is the
runlevel number. You should be able to use an
<b  >append=</b> statement in lilo.conf to do this as
well, although it is probably simpler just to edit the /etc/inittab
file. &mdash;Bob Huack, bobh@wasatch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d2580.0x17cb420"></a>VSF Error Messages</h2></div></div><p>I am using Red Hat 5.1. How do I correct a VSF error message?
I recently compiled a new kernel from the newly released Red Hat
2.0.35 source tree.</p><p>I did a <b  >make dep; make clean; make zImage</b>.
Everything went fine during the compile phase. I ran LILO and set
up my lilo.conf file to test my new kernel. Now, every time I boot,
my system stops and displays:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
VFS: Cannot open root device 16:01 Kernel panic:
VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 16:01
</pre><p>How do I resolve this problem?  &mdash;Marlon, yu133048@yorku.ca
</p><p>The kernel tries to mount your root directory from /dev/hdc1
(16:01 is a hex number representing the /dev/hdc1 as major:minor
number).</p><p>It looks as if you don't have a valid Linux
partition on /dev/hdc1. You should add
<b  >root=/dev/hda1</b> (or whatever your root
partition is) to the LILO prompt or to the
<b  >append=</b> line in /etc/lilo.conf. The
LILO-mini-HOWTO describes this in detail. &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,

am a networking student at a local college. Besides learning about
networking with NT, Windows 95/98 and Novell, I am also learning to
speak Linux. I have Red Hat 5.0 and can install it without any
problems. My problem is not with installing or running the system
(so far), but rather it stems from hardware compatibility, as I
would like to run (in different partitions, of course) NT, Windows
95 and Linux (and possibly Novell) on the same machine.</p><p>I have gone through the compatibility lists for both NT and
Linux and found (from the hardware vendors I've contacted) that
most, if not all, of the hardware listed in both the compatibility
lists is outdated and can barely be obtained. I need NICs and video
cards that are compatible with NT, Windows 95, Linux and Novell for
the same machine.</p><p>Granted, I could not and would not venture to try to learn
all the operating systems at the same time while hoping to maintain
sanity, but I will be running a Windows NT server and Linux on one
machine and Windows 95 and an NT Workstation on another as I
venture to learn one system at a time and put some time into
learning Linux in whatever spare time I have.</p><p>A contact for a Linux hardware vendor in my area (Miami,
Florida) would be awesome. Any help with this will be greatly
appreciated. &mdash;Tim Rodriguez, twr@bellsouth.net</p><p>Lots of NICs and video cards are compatible with both Linux
and Windows. I do admit most recent hardware such as video cards
may not be immediately supported by Linux (though they come with a
Windows 95 driver), but I don't think you'll have to wait too long
to see them working on Linux.</p><p>High-performance graphics cards such as ATI AGP are supported
by XFree86, and a version of XSuSE is available for the latest G200
Matrox card. If you want to use up-to-date graphic adapters, you
can consider Linux commercial servers such as XiGraphics
(http://www.xigraphics.com/) which supports most high-performance
adapters.</p><p>For Ethernet cards, you should check out
