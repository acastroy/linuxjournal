introduction to Linux programming. It does not attempt to teach
programming or C, but serves as a topical reference for experienced
C programmers to become familiar with the Linux programming model.
</p><p>The book is divided into four major parts. Part One,
&ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo;, contains three short chapters covering the
history of Linux, licenses and copyright issues, and the
availability and locations of Linux documentation, mailing lists
and other books and sources of information.</p><p>Part Two provides an introduction to the Linux development
environment and tools. Some of the coverage is minimal; for
example, the section on the GNU debugger,
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>, contains only a short list of
the essential debugger commands and references to two other books
which offer tutorials on the debugger. More extended coverage is
given to memory debugging tools. This includes source examples and
information about creating and using libraries. There is also brief
but important coverage of <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>,
the <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> compiler and its options,
system calls and common error codes.</p><p>The twelve chapters of Part Three, &ldquo;System Programming&rdquo;,
comprise the bulk of the book. These chapters, as elsewhere, are
heavily subdivided into subsections, which I found a little
distracting on first reading, but quite convenient for relocating
information later.</p><p>The authors give an excellent balance of breadth and depth of
coverage, with chapters focusing on processes, simple and advanced
file handling, directory operations, signals, job control, terminal
handling, socket programming, dates and timing, random numbers and
console programming. Virtually all of these topics are augmented
with small source code examples.</p><p>A larger example program,
<span   class="bold"><b>ladsh</b></span>, is a simplified UNIX
command shell which is developed over the course of several
chapters and eventually supports simple built-in commands, command
execution, I/O redirection and job control. The final version of
this program is 710 lines of code, and working through its
development provides a good exercise in tying together some of the
basic elements of Linux system programming.</p><p>Part Four describes a few important development libraries
such as the S-Lang terminal library, the Berkeley database library
and the <span   class="bold"><b>popt</b></span> option parsing
library. This section also provides brief discussions of regular
expressions, dynamic loading with
<span   class="bold"><b>dl</b></span>, and the names and user
databases.</p><p>Finally, three appendices cover direct I/O port access, the
final source version of the ladsh program and the GNU
licenses.</p><p>Overall, the book is well-organized and the writing and
explanations are clear and concise. Although designed explicitly as
a reference for experienced C programmers making the switch to
Linux, I would recommend it as a good additional resource for
anyone just beginning to learn C in a Linux environment.</p></div></div>
