    The experiences of the members of an Italian project in
    establishing wireless networking with Linux in Africa.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd82c38"></a></h2></div></div><p>Global connectivity in Africa is in an
early stage due to installation costs, insufficient basic
infrastructures, low quality of available telecommunication
services and limited financial support. The application of wireless
technology is an effective choice to overcome some of these
problems, at least within smaller areas. This is true even if
transmission speeds are lower than the ones achieved by wired
networks.
</p><p>Within a university campus, it is easier to install a radio
link system than to place cables or expensive optical fibers in the
ground. Furthermore, radio installations are easier to protect from
external natural phenomena such as flood, landslide, etc. At first
glance, wireless LANs look more expensive than wired LANs, but in
the long term they have lower maintenance costs and are relatively
easy to configure. The use of Linux and standard
radio-communication technologies, in conjunction with the many
Linux software applications, makes this task even easier.</p><p>With this scenario in mind, the &ldquo;Programme of Training and
System Development on Networking and Radio Communications&rdquo; was
initiated in 1995 at the Abdus Salam ICTP, Trieste, Italy. The
objective of this programme is to provide technical assistance and
training to academic and scientific institutions in developing
countries&mdash;institutions with a need for small area computer
networks and a connection to the Internet, either directly or
through national networks.</p><p>The Abdus Salam ICTP in Italy and the Obafemi Awolowo
University (OAU) of Ile-Ife in Nigeria agreed to collaborate in the
establishment and future evolution of a Pilot Educational and
Research Computer Network at OAU. Such a network, based principally
on personal computers running Linux, today provides connectivity
between several faculties and departments on the campus.</p><p>Training technical staff on the hardware (PCs, cabling, radio
techniques) and software (network and system administration) took
place initially in Trieste. The developmental and simulation work
was completed in four months, ending in January 1996, when all the
necessary equipment was sent to OAU. The system was installed in
April 1996. At that time, staff members of other Nigerian
universities came to Ile-Ife in order to benefit from this exercise
and be introduced to Linux for the first time. Besides getting
acquainted with the new technology, this experience led to further
connections to the OAUNET. The campus network has been in operation
since June 1996 without any major problems and has proven to be
highly beneficial for academic life at the University.</p><p><a href="2720f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Diagram of Wireless Network at OAU</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd82fa8"></a>The First Campus Network</h2></div></div><p>As shown in Figure 1, the wireless campus network (OAUNET) is
based on a radio system in the UHF band; it initially involved
three separate buildings and had the capacity to be rapidly
extended to other university structures. The wireless link uses a
spread-spectrum, direct-sequence technique providing data
transmission at 2Mbps. The so-called &ldquo;spread-spectrum&rdquo; is a
digital coding method in which the signal is transformed or spread
so that it cannot be received by any receiver except the designated
one that understands the transmitted signal code. It minimizes
interference to other users and normally does not require an
operation license in the ISM (International Scientific and Medical
Band), depending on the regulation adopted by the country.</p><p>Inside each building, an Ethernet 10-BASE 2 cabling structure
is installed in order to keep the initial costs as low as possible
(i.e., no hubs, less cable) and to ensure the local availability of
spares (BNC), etc. In each of these buildings, a Linux PC acts as
&ldquo;faculty server&rdquo; and provides mail services for the local users
and does routing to the backbone. This strategy has been selected
to keep the user-generated traffic local and reduce the access to
the main backbone. All services are TCP/IP-based to keep the system
as standard as possible with Internet protocols, avoiding future
modifications when full connectivity might be provided to the
university.</p><p>The academic network gateway and the main mail host are
located the Department of Computer Science at the university. Due
to national regulations and the lack of a permanent connection to
the Internet, the gateway is linked on a dial-up base
(<span   class="bold"><b>uucp</b></span>) using an international
direct-dialing line to the ICTP computer network in Trieste, Italy.
Software was developed by OAU staff with some assistance from ICTP
to refine the basic uucp mail transfer: a custom
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> delivery program batches
mail in intermediate-sized, BSMTP (batch simple mail transfer
protocol) formatted files; these files are compressed as much as
possible before being transferred over uucp. To cope with telephone
line instabilities, a uucp relay was placed in Lagos; the uucp
configuration takes care of selecting the path either directly to
Trieste or through the Lagos relay, automatically choosing the one
that works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83210"></a>Sticking to Linux</h2></div></div><p>Previous in-house experiences with the UNIX system (SunOS and
Sun Solaris) led us to test, within the project, the commercial
Solaris 2.4 (x86 version) and Linux. While this version of Solaris
required specific hardware components to function on the available
(486) PCs, Linux was found to be more flexible than Solaris in
terms of hardware compatibility and low memory requirements. On top
of that, the possibility of having high-quality free compilers and
software applications motivated us to continue using Linux. In
1995, Windows NT was just starting to become popular, so this
possibility was not considered. At that time, Linux was also
unknown in the Nigerian academic world. The main operating systems
available there were MS-DOS and Windows 3.1.</p><p>The Linux distribution chosen was Slackware. Although more
difficult to install than other distributions, right from the first
trials the system configuration (start-up scripts, etc.) was easier
to locate, understand, manage and, most importantly, to teach.
After a whole cycle of Linux setup experiences and training,
autonomous management of all aspects is today a reality. Part of
the system installed at the OAU is shown in Figure 2.</p><p><a href="2720f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. OAU
Computer Room</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83478"></a>Campus Wireless Connectivity</h2></div></div><p>In order to achieve campus wireless connectivity, the
requirements needed from the system administrator's point of view
were to have a network working all day and night, the least amount
of human intervention and reasonable throughput (bandwidth). The
technology adopted to do this job was, as mentioned above, spread
spectrum.</p><p>The first attempts were implemented using a direct-sequence,
spread-spectrum card supported by the Linux kernel. Most recently,
alternative spread-spectrum equipment that does not require Linux
kernel support is being tested, not because of Linux unreliability,
but because this new equipment has an Ethernet interface instead of
an ISA (industry standard architecture) card that plugs into a PC.
This configuration makes the installation of a wireless link much
easier and more flexible, because you can place the radio unit very
close to the antenna (keeping attenuation very low) and connect it
to the PC using a UTP (unshielded twisted pair) cable. In the case
of an ISA card, the RF output is at the rear of the PC, and it is
there that the antenna is connected. Due to the small output power
and the attenuation of the cable, it is not advisable to use more
than 10m of coax. This new equipment uses a different spreading
method called frequency hopping and provides a higher
bandwidth.</p><p>The possibility of using packet radio technologies, which are
well supported and documented under Linux (AX-25 HOW-TO), was
analyzed at the beginning of the project. However, due to the
specific training required, implementation of this technology was
postponed. An advantage of the present spread-spectrum installation
(running two years without major interventions) is that it is
almost plug, play and go.</p><p>The local network is stable and does not suffer if there is a
failure of the main power supply, because a standby generator and
UPS facilities are available. The number of registered users of the
network increased from 150 in August 1996 to about 290 in September
1996 to more than 600 at present.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83688"></a>On-Line Services</h2></div></div><p>Campus-wide services such as e-mail, FTP, WWW and NFS are
available today within the OAUNET. As connection to the rest of the
world is done on a dial-up line, only e-mail exchange is provided
freely to local users. There is no limitation on the amount and
size of the information being transferred on campus.</p><p>Some of the communication applications like TALK or WRITE
became important due to poor performance of the local PABX (private
automatic branch exchange). For example, after the launch of the
network, people who used to walk to another location to speak with
an administrative officer or colleague now enjoy a TALK between two
buildings located a few kilometers apart. To reduce bandwidth
usage, only text-based conference tools are implemented. We will
also experiment with voice-over input in the future.</p><p>All of these new communication tools are certainly providing
a revolutionary change in the local academic life.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83840"></a>Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>The next phase of the wireless network requires the
installation of other Internet services on the OAUNET. For example,
arrangements are being made to provide connectivity to the library
and other faculties such as Agriculture.</p><p>The success of the Ile-Ife experience stimulated cooperation
with other Nigerian universities. A large program of cooperation
with the National Universities Commission for the establishment of
a national academic network started in 1996 and is still
progressing. Linux is part of the technical basis of this activity.
The most interesting applications of radio have been in individual
universities. Among these is the Bayero University (Kano) which
decided to build a link to connect the new campus with the old
campus of the university (about 9 kilometers). This connection was
implemented using commercial wireless equipment and two Linux
machines as routers, with one of them as the whole university mail
server and uucp gateway.</p><p>Following these results, a series of additional proposals
have been received at our headquarters in Trieste. The first of
these new projects, being carried out in Ghana in collaboration
with countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory
Coast and Morocco, will begin soon.</p><p>These initial experiences with Linux in Africa are proof of
the success and reliability of Linux.</p><p><a href="2720s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p><p>Any of the authors can be reached at radionet@ictp.trieste.it.</p></div></div>
