    Mr. Withers takes a look at basic security issues and how to
    solve them using available tools
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Security is one of the biggest issues on
the Internet today. It affects everyone in one way or another. If
you use Linux, it should be a big concern to you. You may think
security is for system administrators managing 20 or more machines
and not for the average user with a simple PPP link to the
Internet. This may in fact be true, for the chances of anything
happening are rare. Are you willing to take a chance and trust the
security of your system right out of the box?
</p><p>Ignorance on your part may turn into a powerful tool in the
hands of a cracker willing to compromise your system. Is knowing
every in and out truly necessary to keep your system secure enough
for safe usage? Not really, but one of the best things you can do
is become aware of what is available. Many people are intimidated
by the subject, since it covers a wide area, but you don't have to
be a security guru to be safe. On the other hand, you do need to be
willing to get your hands a little dirty.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155e4a8"></a>TCP/IP Basics</h2></div></div><p>Before talking about security, the basic underlying
principles of the TCP/IP protocol suite must be understood. There
are two parts to TCP/IP: <span   class="bold"><b>tcp</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>udp</b></span>. I won't go into great detail
about the difference between them&mdash;mainly, tcp is
connection-oriented and udp is connectionless. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages, and both are used differently.</p><p>These two protocols are the underlying base for applications
run over TCP/IP networks. Each machine connected to a TCP/IP
network has its own IP address to uniquely identify it. Each
application has its own port number on that IP address. A normal
connection to the Internet is no different, since it could be
considered a giant TCP/IP network. The two files which govern an
application's port and protocol are /etc/services and
/etc/protocol. The first, /etc/services, identifies the machine's
services and the port number and protocol for each particular
service. The second file, /etc/protocol, simply identifies the
protocols used in /etc/services.</p><p>These two files identify only each service, its port number
and its protocol. Where is the application? Instead of having an
application running in the background listening for its respective
port and protocol and perhaps generating hundreds of daemons, we
have only one: <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> listens for each service,
and when it notices a remote host making a call, it spawns the
application bound to that port number. How does inetd know which
application goes with which service? It uses its configuration
file, /etc/inetd.conf. This file matches the service found in
/etc/services with an application found on the system.</p><p>For example, let's take a look at a small chunk of that
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/ftpd in.ftpd\
        -l
telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/telnetd\
        in.telnetd
finger stream tcp nowait bin /usr/sbin/fingerd\
        in.fingerd
</pre><p>You may be familiar with some of these common Internet
applications. But what does all this mean? Beginning with the first
column, the variables correspond to the service, the socket type
(depends on tcp or udp), the protocol to be used, wait or nowait
(depends on tcp or udp), user field, the application or server to
be called, and the arguments passed to the application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155e8c8"></a>TCP/IP Security</h2></div></div><p>Where is the security problem in all this? All of these
services offer some kind of access to your system and are the
principal means by which a cracker can compromise your system. How
do we police it? Let us look again at the fields of the code chunk
shown above. The first field, representing the service, can be
understood with common sense. If you won't be using that service,
there is no reason to offer it. If no one besides yourself will be
using your box, comment the line out of your /etc/inetd.conf file.
The same thing applies to those services that run independently of
inetd, such as web servers (<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>)
and mail servers (<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>). Each
has its own daemon running in the background which must be killed
to eliminate them as potential security risks.</p><p>The next field of concern is the user field. Run applications
under the least privileged user possible. If an application doesn't
require root to run properly, don't run it with root
privileges.</p><p>The last field of concern is the most important for those
services you do require to be available. My example above works
fine when offering those services, but inetd doesn't give you much
control. A far better alternative comes with most Linux
distributions: <span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span>. This daemon
wrapper is executed instead of your usual server application, and
offers far more protection. It will log requests for services to
syslog, and it can allow and deny hosts based on rules specified in
the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files. The rules can do
very complex things you wouldn't normally be able to do, such as
allowing or denying certain services for certain hosts. It can also
trigger applications based on access of services or requests by
remote hosts. The list of possibilities is endless. Details on this
subject can be found in the August 1997 <i  >Linux Journal</i> (issue 40) in the excellent article entitled
&ldquo;Wrap a Security Blanket Around Your Computer&rdquo; by Lee Brotzman.
Many security and administration books covering this subject are
also available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155ebe0"></a>Focusing on your System</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have commented out those services that aren't
needed, what do you do about those that are? As we discussed above,
you could use tcp wrappers, but that only cuts it for services
offered by inetd, and tcpd doesn't necessarily mean your system is
secure&mdash;those applications can still be exploited. Also, those
services independent of inetd and those people who
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> have access to your system must be
considered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155ed40"></a>Being Aware</h2></div></div><p>The best thing to do is be aware. If you run a news server
right out of the box, you could be taking a severe security risk.
On the other hand, if you learn everything including known security
holes, then you have the opportunity to search for a patch or
solution. There are also alternatives such as using different
programs. Instead of using an insecure application like TELNET, use
one that is more secure and designed with security flaws in mind. A
secure replacement for TELNET would be
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>; for sendmail, which is
notorious for its security flaws, a secure alternative is
<span   class="bold"><b>qmail</b></span>.</p><p>What about users who have authorized access, or those who
don't but manage to gain access? There are all kinds of known
security holes, back doors and other nasty things which can be used
for no good. Since you can't beat them, join them. By this, I mean
learn all about those exploits; new ones are discovered every day
and patches are made to remedy the situation. Several web sites
thoroughly document these problems and solutions (see
Resources).</p><p>The system can also be exploited through
<span   class="bold"><b>setuid</b></span> programs. These are
programs which run with the privilege of the program's owner when
executed. These programs could even be setuid root and, as a
result, when executed they have the permissions of root. Crackers
can use this to gain root privileges. The best way to deal with
this situation is to learn about possible problems with programs
that run with the root setuid bit set on and disable those programs
which are not needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155f000"></a>Access Restriction</h2></div></div><p>With all of the above in mind, let's look at some nifty tools
and methods for internal security. Obviously, someone can
compromise your system if they have access. To limit user access on
a machine, you use two files: /etc/securetty and /etc/login.access.
The first file defines which ttys terminals can be logged into by
root. The second limits user access, but is far more flexible.
Lines in this file follow the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>permission</em></span> : <span   class="emphasis"><em>users</em></span> : <span   class="emphasis"><em>origins</em></span>
</pre><p>where
<b  ><i><tt>permission</tt></i></b> is either
access granted (+) or access denied (-),
<b  ><i><tt>users</tt></i></b> is a list of
login names, group names or <b  >ALL</b>, and
<b  ><i><tt>origins</tt></i></b> specifies
&ldquo;where&rdquo; a user can log in. An example would be the following
line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
- : ALL EXCEPT bob : ALL
</pre>


This instruction means <b  >bob</b> is the only one
allowed to log in from anywhere&mdash;everyone else is denied access to
log in from all ttys, hosts, domains, etc.
<pre     class="programlisting">
- : ALL : .anytown.state.us console
</pre>


This statement denies access to everyone except those in the domain
<b  >.anytown.st.us</b> and those from the console. With
a bit of imagination, one could come up with some pretty complex
rules for logins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155f688"></a>setuid</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned above, setuid programs can be hazardous. One
way to deal with these programs is to find them first. This can be
done with a simple script, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command as shown in
<a href="3062l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>Be aware that this script will generate a file containing
sensitive information. After viewing it, you should delete it. Once
you've looked at the list and found any scripts or programs that
aren't necessary, you could disable them as root using
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 644 <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>Once setuid is disabled, the script or program is no longer a
security risk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1466580.0x155f9f8"></a>Tools</h2></div></div><p>So far, we have discussed a couple of techniques to tighten
system security. What about testing the security on your system? Is
it vulnerable to attack? Are there back doors? Several tools are
available to answer these questions. Satan can scan a system for
any back doors or holes that might become potential security risks.
Other programs like <span   class="bold"><b>netwatch</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpdump</b></span> can monitor network
traffic on your system. A packet sniffer program, SniffIt, can also
help you in many ways. Packet sniffers have a bad reputation,
because they can be a security risk to your system, but they can
also help you find problems. A lot of network clients/hosts send
information using plaintext, which presents a severe security
risk.</p><p>Using <span   class="bold"><b>sniffit</b></span> you can test
various combinations to see if there is any potential risk. The
program can be downloaded from the URL shown in Resources. I won't
discuss compiling and installing sniffit, for that's another topic.
Once you have the program up and running, you can give it a test
drive. To use the interactive mode, which has a nice curses-based
interface, type the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sniffit -i
</pre><p>In Figure 1, you can see two IP addresses: a destination and
a source. The source IP is sending packets from port 19 to the
destination IP, 192.168.1.2. Notice that port 19 is &ldquo;chargen&rdquo; and
does nothing but send characters. (Packet sniffing works only in
situations with high bandwidth.) If the source and destination port
are changed to 21, any TELNET sessions from 192.168.1.1 to
192.168.1.2 can be picked up, thus allowing the viewer to see what
the TELNET user is typing in his session. If the user is using
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> instead of TELNET, the viewer
would see only useless garbage.

however, there is far more to it than this. The best way to make
your system more secure is to learn more about Linux security and
to grab some of the tools I have mentioned (see Resources).
Security is like philosophy&mdash;there is no definitive answer, just a
lot of questions and books.</p><p><a href="3062s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
