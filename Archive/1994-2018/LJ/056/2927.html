    Mr. Shoham tells us how his company set up an Internet
    banking system using Linux for a bank in Western Canada.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a264a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>M-Tech is a computer security products
and services company based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. This
article describes our experience developing an Internet banking
system for a major financial institution in Western Canada. Since
it discusses the computer security infrastructure of this
organization, they have asked that we not name them explicitly
here. The system is now in production, and allows thousands of
users to make financial transactions on-line.
</p><p>This article will describe:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What components are needed to build an Internet
banking system</p></li><li><p>How Linux made developing the Internet banking
system easier</p></li><li><p>The deployment of Linux servers as key components
of the final system</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a26870"></a>What is Internet Banking?</h2></div></div><p>Internet banking may be defined as any system that gives
customers of a financial institution the ability to execute
financial transactions across the Internet. Since the connection
between the customer and the financial institution is electronic,
we are limited to transactions that do not require the exchange of
money or documents. What remains are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Funds transfers</p></li><li><p>Account balance and history inquiries</p></li><li><p>Bill payments</p></li><li><p>Loan applications</p></li><li><p>Retrieving information about services, branch
locations, etc.</p></li><li><p>Sending feedback to the financial
institution</p></li></ul></div><p>While a given Internet banking system might not support every
one of these features, it is possible to implement any of them.
Internet banking is basically a user-friendly, secure and
distributed user interface to existing banking systems. With this
in mind, we were hired to do the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Design and deploy a network and application
infrastructure to support the new application.</p></li><li><p>Help implement a WWW-based user interface in
Java.</p></li><li><p>Help integrate the new system with existing
business logic in our customer's mainframe.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a270b0"></a>Functionality</h2></div></div><p>As outlined earlier, the Internet banking system must be able
to support any transaction type where an exchange of physical items
(such as cash) is not required. Since the set of possible
transactions will evolve, it should be easy to extend the system to
support new transaction types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a271b8"></a>User Interface</h2></div></div><p>The application is intended for use by thousands of users,
many of whom have limited experience with computers. Accordingly,
the user interface should be suitable for people whose computer
skills consist only of having access to a computer, knowing how to
start a WWW browser and how to type in a URL.</p><p>Additional requirements for the Internet banking system we
were hired to construct are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Different groups in our customer's organization
must be able to easily implement different user interfaces to the
application with different graphics, advertising and menus.</p></li><li><p>Our customer must be able to customize and extend
the system's functionality in the future.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a274d0"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>By far, the most important feature of an Internet banking
system is that it should do no harm. In particular, the system must
ensure that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The existing &ldquo;backend&rdquo; (a mainframe used to
process transactions) should be invulnerable to attack. Most
importantly, it must not be vulnerable to denial-of-service
attacks.</p></li><li><p>A third party, connected to the network somewhere
between the user on the Internet and the Internet banking system on
our client's network, should find it impossible to decipher or
alter the communication between those points.</p></li><li><p>Users should be authenticated using as reliable a
mechanism as economically feasible.</p></li></ul></div><p>As a general rule, the system should be as safe, both for the
user and the financial institution, as transactions made by the
user in a bank branch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a27898"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>When deployed, the system consists of four physical
components:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Client workstations, which include a WWW browser
with Java and SSL capabilities</p></li><li><p>One or more firewall systems to protect the
Internet banking servers against external assault</p></li><li><p>One or more application gateways: the Java user
interface applet is downloaded from these and must communicate with
the backend through them.</p></li><li><p>A backend transaction processing system: for most
financial institutions, including our customer, an IBM mainframe is
used.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a27cb8"></a>Networks</h2></div></div><p>There are three conceptual network segments between these
hardware components:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The Internet between the client and an external
firewall</p></li><li><p>Network-1 between the external firewall and the
application WWW server</p></li><li><p>Network-2 between the application WWW server and
the mainframe</p></li></ol></div><p>This arrangement is illustrated in Figure 1.
</p><p><a href="2927f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Linux
in the Loop</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1ea18"></a>A Robust Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>In developing our customer's Internet banking system, we
first deployed a Linux-based development environment consisting of
a Compaq Prosignia server, 64MB of RAM and a pair of 4.3GB Ultra
Wide SCSI disks. We installed a Debian Linux distribution on this
system. On the platform we installed a wide range of tools, shown
in <a href="2927t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a>.</p><p>We used this setup as our primary development environment.
Using Apache-SSL, we were able to test various browsers to check
the application's behaviour and to adjust its appearance.</p><p>Using some customized Makefiles and libraries, we were able
to write Java client code, C-language CGI and daemon programs,
C-language mainframe programs and COBOL program stubs all on this
environment.</p><p>By implementing an RPC system, where a code generator
translates a master transaction-description file into source code
for each target platform, we were able to add new transaction types
to the Internet banking application with just a few short
commands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1ec80"></a>Network Security</h2></div></div><p>To secure the final system against denial-of-service,
eavesdropping and impersonation attacks, we used Linux to implement
an external firewall. Since our access control rules are simple and
static, we were able to use the Linux kernel's built-in packet
filtering features to limit remote access to just the minimum
required services&mdash;DNS and HTTPS.</p><p>As a further precaution against unauthorized access, no
system on the Internet can connect to our customer's mainframe
without first passing through our application code. There is simply
no path for network packets from the Internet to the mainframe. Our
application system cannot connect to any computer other than the
mainframe; this minimizes the exposure of other systems on our
customer's network.</p><p>To ensure private communication, we use the SSL protocol,
embedded in HTTPS, to protect the communication between the
application WWW server and the client machine. We also do not
entirely trust the physical connection between the application WWW
server and the mainframe, so all communication between our
application on the WWW server and our transaction management
software on the mainframe is encrypted.</p><p>Finally, since users are likely to log in and walk away from
their terminals, we implemented a token management system between
the client Java applets and the mainframe, where tokens have an
implicit timeout of a few minutes. Unattended sessions look exactly
like attended ones on the client's machine, but are blocked from
making new transactions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1ee90"></a>Redundancy and Availability</h2></div></div><p>An important concern in a live system of this magnitude is
the possibility of down time, caused by power outages, hardware
failures or high load. Our system is protected against power
outages by uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs). In addition, we
implemented two identical application servers, each of which serves
as both a DNS and an application server. One system is configured
as the primary DNS, and the other is the secondary DNS. If the
primary should fail, DNS queries will cause clients to connect to
the secondary system instead.</p><p>Finally, all connection-state information is stored in a
database on the mainframe. Since the application servers are
stateless, consecutive transactions can be routed through an
arbitrarily large number of application servers, all operating in
parallel. And since the application servers are PCs, we can scale
the system up to handle an arbitrarily large amount of traffic
simply by buying more PC servers, along with an intelligent
router.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1eff0"></a>An Open-minded Customer</h2></div></div><p>To take full benefit of Linux's technical advantages,
however, our customer had to be open-minded. We have been fortunate
to work with this customer, since they judged the merits of this
architecture on the grounds of its reliability, features,
extensibility, maintainability and cost. We are convinced that the
implementation team's open-minded approach to technological
alternatives allowed them to implement the best possible solution,
rather than just the same technology as their competitors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1f0f8"></a>A Mature Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>We have used Linux as a development platform before and chose
it because of the rich set of tools included with most
distributions. This project held no surprises&mdash;Linux was a
convenient, productive and reliable development platform. We never
had problems with any of the development tools, and never
experienced system downtime.</p><p>In the past, we have developed software for Windows NT as
well as for other UNIX platforms. Linux compares very favorably
with these as a development and deployment platform&mdash;it is simply
more full-featured and better supported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1f258"></a>A Robust Production Platform</h2></div></div><p>Linux is proving its worth as a production environment as
well. It runs on inexpensive hardware and, along with Apache SSL,
offers excellent WWW server performance. We would be hard-pressed
to find comparable systems on which to run our WWW servers,
development environment and firewall without spending much more
money and settling for a less comprehensive tool set.</p><p>In this project, the rich set of network features found in
Linux proved especially useful. In particular, the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Setting up the firewall was simple, and the
resulting system is quite effective.</p></li><li><p>Our development server uses
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> for secure remote connections,
the X Window System for convenient access to source files and
tools, and Samba to allow developers to access files directly from
their PCs.</p></li><li><p>BIND made it easy to implement a failover from the
primary to a backup server.</p></li><li><p>Various shell tools make it easy to keep the
software on the backup server current.</p></li></ul></div><p>Linux is not only feature rich, but also well-supported. We
have found that whenever new security exposures are discovered,
Linux is invariably the first system for which patches or
workarounds are available. For instance, the ping-of-death
vulnerability was reportedly fixed in three hours, and a Linux
patch for a common buffer-overrun vulnerability was released
alongside the discovery of the bug itself. We doubt that any vendor
could match the response time of the worldwide community of Linux
programmers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x292e580.0x2a1f780"></a>An Open Future</h2></div></div><p>In this project, we built just one application&mdash;a user
interface with which our customer's clients can make financial
transactions. However, there is nothing about our technology that
is specific to the Internet or even to banking.</p><p>Within our customer's organization, the same technology could
also be used to enable thin clients to function as teller
workstations, process loan applications and support communication
with automated teller machines and telephone voice response
systems. Beyond the financial sector, this technology could be used
for any transaction processing system with a broad or
geographically distributed user community. Examples include travel
booking systems, libraries, government registries and more.</p><p><a href="2927s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p><p><a href="2927s2.html" target="_self">Postscript</a></p></div></div>
