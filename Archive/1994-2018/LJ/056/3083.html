    An introduction to X structure, configuration and
    customization.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c14a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When the X Window System was first
released, many complained that the system was big, slow and
complicated. My first experience with X was installing one of the
earliest releases available for Intel hardware on my 386 running
UNIX with 4MB of RAM and an 80MB hard drive. The installation took
up most of the drive, and X ran so slowly (with much thrashing of
virtual memory) that it was simply unusable. I quickly decided to
remove it from my system and went on to &ldquo;real work&rdquo;.
</p><p>However, I got a taste of what X was like and appreciated how
the developers took the &ldquo;high road&rdquo; in their design. They
combined a high degree of versatility and a client-server
architecture, at the noticeable expense of performance on what is
now generally considered to be archaic hardware.</p><p>Today, most computers running Linux have more than sufficient
hardware resources to run X with good performance, so running X on
an inexpensive desktop system is commonplace. Now that we've all
got X running on our desktops, the next hurdle is configuring X and
customizing it to meet our needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c1660"></a>X's Client-Server Architecture</h2></div></div><p>I will start out by presenting a brief description of how X
is structured and how the parts interoperate. Once you know this,
it will be much easier to make sense of the implementation
details.</p><p>One of the most basic facts to be aware of is that X is not
part of the kernel. Unlike other operating systems, where
applications make requests to put up windows, menus, et al., to the
operating system API, X is entirely contained in user space,
running as ordinary processes. These processes are classed into two
groups: client processes and server processes.</p><p>The job of the X server is to handle the interface to the
hardware (graphics adapter, keyboard and mouse) and a few
additional low-level services such as drawing, color allocation,
event handling, inter-client communication and managing a resource
database of user preferences.</p><p>Clients communicate with the X server through the X protocol,
which can be run over interprocess communication (IPC) on one
system, or between systems using TCP/IP. This allows an X client to
run on one system and use the display, keyboard and mouse on
another. Yes, it is even possible to run an X protocol over the
Internet.</p><p>For example, if I use TELNET to access my ISP and run the
command <span   class="bold"><b>xeyes</b></span>, the program will
start up and display a window on my Linux system. The program seems
to be running locally, even though it is actually running on the
remote system and just using my system for the display. The way
this works is that the remote system is running xeyes, while the
client (requesting services) and my Linux system are running the X
server (which fulfills the client's requests). This, of course,
requires that my system be set up to allow it; I use the
<span   class="bold"><b>xhost</b></span> command to allow my ISP's
system to use the X server on my system. Also, the
<b  >$DISPLAY</b> environment variable in my TELNET
session must be set correctly (see below). I am using this example
only as a demonstration; if you want your system to be secure, you
will probably not want to allow people to access your X server from
an outside network. One trick used by crackers is to put up an
invisible window covering your display that catches all keyboard
input, including passwords.</p><p>Each display is handled by one server process, but many
clients can use a display at the same time. One of the most
fundamental client types is the window manager, which allows the
user to manipulate windows. A window manager performs actions such
as drawing &ldquo;decorations&rdquo; around windows (borders, title bars and
buttons), and provides functionality such as pop-up menus and the
iconization of running clients. Desktop environments such as KDE
and Gnome are implemented as user-space X clients, as are all other
applications that run under X. These applications can be of any
level of complexity, from <span   class="bold"><b>xlogo</b></span> to
Netscape Navigator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c1a80"></a>X Administration</h2></div></div><p>In the remainder of this article, I will cover some basic X
Window System administration. A full treatment would take a whole
book, so I'm going to discuss only what I consider the most
important points for the novice X administrator. For the most part,
I will assume you have X already configured and running. I will
skip over advanced topics such as security and running X over a
network (on X terminals or remote systems) as much as possible.
This article covers XFree86, which comes with most Linux
distributions. If you are running a commercial X server, you may
want to skip the section below on configuring the X server, but the
rest of the material covered is independent of the server you are
using.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c1b88"></a>X Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>Most files for the X Window System including executables,
libraries, manual pages, include files and miscellaneous other
files are kept in the /usr/X11R6 directory tree. There is usually a
symbolic link called /usr/X11 to that directory.</p><p>The systemwide configuration files for X are in the directory
/etc/X11. If you get a listing of that directory, the output will
look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X fs mwm xdm
XF86Config fvwm twm xinit
XF86Config.0 fvwm2 wmconfig xsm
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c1d40"></a>X Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>In the above listing, X is a symbolic link to the X server
executable, which is in the directory /usr/X11R6/bin. Note that
there is also a symbolic link called X in /usr/X11R6/bin, which
points to /etc/X11/X, rather than the X server in the same
directory. (Yes, there is a reason for doing it that way. Can you
figure out why?) XF86Config is the file read by the XFree86 X
server while starting up, and contains information about the mouse,
graphics card, monitor and a few other things the server needs in
order to run. Most of the other objects in /etc/X11 are directories
containing sample startup files for programs that have the same
name as the directory. The /xdm directory contains startup files
for <span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>, the X display manager. I
will discuss the files in that directory later.</p><p>The XF86Config file is usually created during the
installation of Linux. If you do not yet have X installed (or
working properly), you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>xf86config</b></span> command to create it.
Make sure you have collected detailed information about your mouse,
graphics card and monitor first. Once you have a working
XF86Config, you can modify it to change X's behavior. There are two
warnings I want to give before saying anything else.</p><p>First, make a backup of the file before modifying it in any
way. In fact, this is a good idea even if you do not plan to make
any changes. Notice on the previous page that I have the file named
XF86Config.0 in /etc/X11. That is simply a copy of the original
XF86Config made immediately after Linux was installed. If anything
untoward ever happens to my XF86Config file, I can quickly restore
it from that backup file. Before making any changes to the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
file, I make a backup using a numbered extension, such as
XF86Config.1, XF86Config.2, XF86Config.3 and so on. That way, I
create a history of my modifications, and can restore the
configuration to its original state or to any previous state. This
is a fairly common practice among system administrators that I
suggest you adopt immediately, if you haven't already. It is also a
good idea to make a backup of this type for the version of the file
you are currently using, in case it is unintentionally overwritten
by XF86Config or a reinstallation of the X software.</p><p>The second warning about XF86Config is that the part
beginning with <b  >Section "Monitor"</b> and ending with
<b  >"EndSection"</b> contains very sensitive
information. If you mess it up, you could cause physical damage to
your monitor! So don't change any of it, at least not until after
you have read the man page for XF86Config and the
XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO.</p><p>Now let's have some fun. A couple of simple (and safe) things
can be modified in your XF86Config file relating to how your X
session appears and functions. Both of these appear near the bottom
of the file, in the parts beginning with <b  >Section
"Screen"</b> and ending with <b  >"EndSection"</b>.
Take a look at your XF86Config file. Note that there are a few
Screen sections. Each corresponds to a specific X server, labelled
by the &ldquo;Driver&rdquo; tag. You will need to identify the one that goes
with the server you are running. If your graphics card is
reasonably new, you are probably running one of the accelerated
servers, which correspond to the section that looks like the one
shown in <a href="3083l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. Most newer
systems use the accelerated server, but if yours does not, don't
worry&mdash;the sections for the other servers (svga, vga16 and vga2)
are similar, just much simpler.</p><p>The strings that go with the <b  >Device</b> and
<b  >Monitor</b> tags are descriptive in nature and not
critical. Notice the <b  >DefaultColorDepth</b> tag,
which did not appear in my XF86Config immediately after
installation. I added it to set X's default to something more
interesting than the usual of 8-bits/pixel, which may run the
fastest, but allows for only 256 colors. 16-bits/pixel allows many
more (65536) colors, and 24-bits/pixel allows for &ldquo;true color&rdquo; of
8 (or more) bits for each of the red, green and blue color
components.</p><p>Next come the <b  >Display</b> subsections. Each
has a different <b  >Depth</b> tag, one for each mode
(bits/pixel) the server can handle.</p><p>The <b  >Modes</b> tag defines the physical screen
resolutions the monitor supports. These must correspond to the
<b  >Modeline</b> entries in the
<b  >Monitor</b> section of XF86Config or they will be
ignored. The first valid entry is the default resolution for X
server initialization. I am often working with development projects
where I target the least common denominator of 640x480, so I use
that as my default; however, you might want to start out at 800x600
or higher. If you want to switch resolutions after the server
starts up, hold down both <b  >alt</b> and
<b  >ctrl</b> on the keyboard and press either the
<b  >+</b> or <b  >-</b> key on the numeric
keypad to cycle forward or backward through the list.</p><p>The <b  >ViewPort</b> tag sets the upper left
corner of the virtual display and controls which part of it will
appear centered on the screen when X first starts up. This works
only if your virtual area is larger than your physical resolution.
I prefer to leave this at <b  >0 0</b>, but try using a
few different non-negative values and see what happens. You'll
notice the screen is shifted by that many pixels (horizontal and
vertical) from normal.</p><p>Last, there is the <b  >Virtual</b> tag, which is
used to set the size of the virtual screen area. In 16-bit mode, I
may use a physical resolution of 640x480, but I still have the
ability to pan around (using the mouse) within a larger virtual
area of 1024x768. The virtual screen area is limited by the amount
of video memory on the video card. For example, at 1024x768 pixels
and 16 bits/pixel (or 2 bytes per pixel), a total of 1.5MB of video
RAM is being used. Some cards have only one megabyte of video
memory and would not be able to support that configuration. Also,
note that the X server may use a small amount of video memory for
other purposes, so you may not be able to use all of it for your
bit-planes.</p><p>Many more things can be done with the XF86Config file than I
can describe here. For additional details, check out the XF86Config
manual page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14c2948"></a>Starting the X Server</h2></div></div><p>There are a few different ways to get the X server started.
One of the first methods found by many new users is the
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> command, which is actually
a shell script wrapper for the
<span   class="bold"><b>xinit</b></span> program. Using startx with
no arguments should be enough to start up an X session; however,
unless you have set the DefaultColorDepth as described above, you
will probably get only 8 bit-planes. If you want better colors, you
will need to add some arguments, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
startx -- -bpp 16
</pre><p>This starts X with 16 bit-planes. The first two dashes cause
the <b  >-bpp&nbsp;16</b> to be passed as arguments to
the X server, rather than the xinit program. If you get tired of
entering the whole command each time, you can create a file named
.xserverrc in your home directory and put in it the command to
start the X server, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
exec X -bpp 16 :0
</pre>


See the xinit(1) manual page for details.
</p><p>When X starts, it will switch to the first available virtual
screen and use that for the display. Most Linux systems come with
the first six virtual screens assigned as virtual consoles, so the
user can switch among them by pressing the <b  >alt</b>
key and a function key
(<b  >f1</b>-<b  >f6</b>) at the same time. To
get to one of those from the X display, it is necessary to add the
<b  >ctrl</b> key, i.e., use
<b  >ctrl-alt-f1</b> to get from X to the first virtual
console. Then, to return to the X session, press
<b  >ctrl-alt-f7</b>. If your system doesn't have six
virtual consoles enabled, you will have to use a different function
key.</p><p>Now, if we can have six (or more) virtual consoles, why not
have more than one X session? This is done by providing
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> with more information. The
X server needs to know which virtual screen to use and what to name
the display.</p><p>For example, to start a 24-bit display on virtual screen 8,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
startx -- :1 -bpp 24 vt8
</pre><p>and to start an 8-bit display on virtual screen 9, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
startx -- :2 -bpp 8 vt9
</pre>


The <b  >:1</b> and <b  >:2</b> are the names
that X uses to refer to the displays. The full format for the name
is <b  >host:N.M</b>, where <b  >host</b> is
the host name of the system, <b  >N</b> is the number of
the display on that system, and <b  >M</b> is the number
of the screen (in multi-headed displays using more than one
monitor).
</p><p>The designation <b  >:0</b> is simply shorthand for
the first display on the local system,
<b  >localhost:0.0</b>. The names <b  >:1</b>
and <b  >:2</b> refer to the second and third displays.
To switch among them, simply use the <b  >ctrl-alt-fn</b>
combination.</p><p>To see how these work, start up the <b  >:1</b> and
<b  >:2</b> displays as shown above, and switch to your
first display (<b  >:0</b>) using
<b  >ctrl-alt-f7</b>. Then from a virtual terminal (e.g.,
xterm, rxvt), run the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xeyes -display :1
</pre><p>The xeyes program will run (you won't get another shell
prompt), but it is not visible on the screen. Now switch to the
second display (<b  >ctrl-alt-f8</b>) and you will see
it. When xeyes exits, you will get another prompt in your shell
session on <b  >:0</b>.
</p><p>Many X programs support the <b  >-display</b>
option to specify the display to use. Note that the environment
variable DISPLAY is set to the default display. If you run the
command <b  >echo $DISPLAY</b> from a virtual terminal in
each display, you can see how it is set differently on each
one.</p><p>When xinit starts up, it starts the X server and then looks
for a file called .xinitrc in the user's home directory, which is a
shell script that xinit runs. That file usually contains, as a
minimum, lines like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xterm &amp;
exec fvwm
</pre><p>which start an xterm terminal emulator, then it replaces the
xinit process with the FVWM window manager. In turn,
<span   class="bold"><b>fvwm</b></span> looks for its startup file
called ~/.fvwmrc. A default for this file can be found in the
/etc/X11/fvwm directory. Notice that the xterm process starts
running without a window manager. A window manager is not a
required part of an X session, but you will probably want to have
one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14ba308"></a>XDM</h2></div></div><p>Using startx is easy, but if you use X a lot you will
probably want to log into it directly without the complication of
having to log into a text console first. Direct logins to X are
handled using XDM. The files in /etc/X11/xdm are used to define a
configuration, and then the simple command
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> starts X with an xlogin screen
to allow someone to enter their user name and password. Like
startx, the xdm command can be entered from a command prompt (as
superuser). This is good for testing, but xdm is actually meant to
be run automatically during the boot sequence&mdash;more on that later.
Typing <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> to get a listing of my
/etc/X11/xdm directory outputs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GiveConsole Xresources.0 Xsession.0 Xsetup_2
xdm-config.0
TakeConsole Xservers Xsetup_0 authdir
Xaccess Xservers.0 Xsetup_0.0 chooser
Xresources Xsession Xsetup_1 xdm-config
</pre><p>The key file among these is xdm-config, which is the default
configuration file for xdm. The xdm-config file defines the basic
configuration, including which files to look in for further setup
information. The contents of xdm-config look like
<a href="3083l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. Note that the names of
other files used by XDM are defined here, so it is possible to use
different file names or put the files in other directories. The
defaults work fine, but be aware that on other UNIX systems, or
even different Linux distributions, files may be in a different
location. In any case, you can familiarize yourself with the
system's configuration by looking at the xdm-config file.</p><p>The information in xdm-config is specified using X resources,
which is a bit like setting values of data structure fields in a
programming language.</p><p>The first line of the file sets
<b  >DisplayManager.errorLogFile</b>, which is where xdm
writes its error messages. If xdm is not starting properly, take a
look at the error file. You will probably find some useful messages
there. On older Red Hat systems and other UNIX systems, the file
was placed in /etc/X11/xdm, but in more recent versions (e.g., Red
Hat 5.1), it is in /var/log/xdm-error.log. This is in accordance
with the Linux File System Hierarchy Standard (FSSTND).</p><p><b  >DisplayManager.pidFile</b> (/var/run/xdm.pid)
is a file to which xdm writes its process ID. This can be handy if
you are adding customizations and you want to restart X to check if
they work. Type the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -TERM `cat /var/run/xdm.pid`
</pre><p>to kill the xdm process before restarting it. Actually, I
prefer the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
killall -TERM xdm
</pre>


which does the same thing. A variation is to replace the TERM
(terminate) signal with HUP (hangup); this does not shut down any
running X sessions, but does restart xdm with the new configuration
(used for any new sessions that are started). If you are doing your
X administration from within an X session, you may want to use that
method to avoid discontinuities in your GUI services.
</p><p>The file pointed to by
<b  >DisplayManager.servers</b> (Xservers) is used by xdm
to start the X server processes. It contains information that tells
xdm how to start each X server process. For example, the
line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 16 vt7 :0
</pre><p>in my Xservers file will start display <b  >:0</b>
on the local system using the command and arguments as provided. To
start more than one display, simply add lines to the Xservers file
in this same format. If the Xservers file contains these lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 16 vt7 :0
:1 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 24 vt8 :1
:2 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 8 vt9 :2
</pre>


three displays will start up when xdm is run&mdash;a 16-bit display on
virtual terminal 7, a 24-bit display on vt8 and 8-bit on vt9. The
<b  >-bpp&nbsp;16</b> option is redundant, since I've
defined DefaultColorDepth to be 16 in my XF86Config file.
</p><p>Notice the asterisk in the last few lines of xdm-config. This
mechanism is called &ldquo;loose binding&rdquo; and is a wild card character
used to match all possible field names. The field names in this
case are the names of the displays. Display <b  >:0</b>
is referred to as <b  >DisplayManager._0</b>. (It is _0
for display <b  >:0</b>, _1 for display
<b  >:1</b> and so on.) The underscore is used instead of
the colon because in a resource, the colon is a separator between
the resource name and its setting. An asterisk means the same file
is used for all of the displays, but when the display is specified
explicitly (called &ldquo;tight binding&rdquo;), the file is used just for
that display. Of course, it would be possible to use only tight
bindings and specify the same file each time, but the loose binding
method is easier.</p><p>After the X server starts and before the xlogin program is
run, xdm looks in the file defined by the
<b  >DisplayManager._0.setup</b> resource (Xsetup_0).
This is a shell script containing arbitrary commands, so it has a
great deal of versatility. I like to put a more pleasing background
behind the xlogin window than the default black and white pattern,
so I might use a command like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11/bin/xsetroot -solid darkcyan
</pre><p>to make the background (root window) a solid color. To make
things more interesting, the lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11/bin/xloadimage -onroot \
  /usr/local/images/tiles/purpleblue2.gif
</pre>


tile the background with an image of my own design. Be sure the
xloadimage program is on your system before doing this.
</p><p>Again, a warning about security. The program(s) run out of
Xsetup._* files may have their keyboard and mouse inputs disabled,
but if they do not exit before the user successfully logs in, they
will continue to run with superuser (root) permissions. For
example, if the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11/bin/rxvt &amp;
</pre><p>were in the Xsetup_0 file, the user who logs in on display :0
is granted a superuser shell, which is not a desired condition.
This is an obvious example, but others may not be as obvious, so be
careful.
</p><p>Around Christmas, it might seem cute (and harmless) to
put</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11/bin/xsnow &amp;
</pre><p>into the Xsetup file to make snow appear to fall while the
computer is waiting for a login; however, since it will be running
with the user ID of root, the user will not have permission to kill
the process after login. Also, many people will get tired of seeing
snow falling in the background of their X sessions after awhile.
Fortunately, there is a way to make the
<span   class="bold"><b>xsnow</b></span> process exit before the
user's login session begins. First, add a line that saves the
process ID of xsnow immediately after the one that starts it, like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11/bin/xsnow &amp;
echo $! &gt;/var/run/xlogin_xsnow.pid
</pre>


After the user is authenticated by xlogin and before his X session
starts, xdm runs the shell script named in the
<b  >DisplayManager._0.startup</b> resource
(GiveConsole). This is normally used to change the ownership of
/dev/console to the user, so that error messages directed to the
console can be displayed in the X session, using xterm or rxvt with
the <b  >-C</b> option, or with xconsole. However, you
can add whatever you want to the script. For example, the following
lines force xsnow to exit:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -9 `cat /var/run/xlogin_xsnow.pid`
rm -f /var/run/xlogin_xsnow.pid
</pre>


Now, here's an exercise for you. Many sites want the ability to
shut down the system directly from the xlogin screen without
requiring the user to log in or <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span>
with the root password. With your favorite text editor, create a
Tcl/Tk script named <span   class="bold"><b>xlogin_buttons</b></span>
that contains the lines shown in <a href="3083l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3</a>, and make it executable with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x xlogin_buttons
</pre>


</p><p>Now follow the above xsnow example to modify your Xsetup_0
and GiveButtons scripts to use the Tcl/Tk script instead of xsnow.
I put the script in /etc/X11/xdm and put these lines in my Xsetup_0
script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/X11/xdm/xlogin_buttons &amp;
echo $! &gt;/var/run/xlogin_buttons_0.pid
</pre><p>and these two lines in my GiveConsole script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -9 `cat /var/run/xlogin_buttons_0.pid`
rm -f /var/run/xlogin_buttons_0.pid
</pre>


Be sure to check that the Xsetup_0 and GiveConsole files are
defined in the xdm-config file.
</p><p>Along with the <b  >DisplayManager._0.startup</b>
resource is <b  >DisplayManager._0.reset</b>
(TakeConsole), invoked after the X session ends and before xdm
resets the X server prior to the next login. Normally, this simply
changes the ownership of /dev/console back to root, but you can add
customizations there too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x14bb5f0"></a>Configuring xlogin</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>xlogin</b></span> program
identifies and authorizes the user by accepting the user name and
password. These are entered at the prompts in the xlogin window. If
you want to change the xlogin display, take a look at the file
pointed to by <b  >DisplayManager*resources</b>, which on
my system is called /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources. That file contains
resource definitions for the xlogin and other programs started by
xdm before the user's X session begins. Rather than having xlogin
display the host name of my system, I prefer the message &ldquo;Welcome
to Linux&rdquo; colored blue. To do this, I define the
<b  >xlogin*greeting</b> and
<b  >xlogin*greetColor</b> resources as shown in
<a href="3083l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>.</p><p>A security consultant might wince at seeing a system that is
configured to say &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; to any user who happens to pass by
and &ldquo;Try Again&rdquo; if they don't guess the right user name/password
combination. I do this only on my home system. If you're working in
an academic or corporate environment, you might want to use
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST
xlogin*fail: Authorized Users ONLY!
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x17cfeb0"></a>Color Specification</h2></div></div><p>In the above example, most of the colors are specified as RGB
triplets in the form of <b  >#rrggbb</b>. You can use 1
to 4 hexadecimal digits for each primary color, so to specify a
not-totally-bright red, <b  >#c00</b>,
<b  >#c00000</b> and <b  >#c00000000000</b> are
all equivalent. You can use color names like
<b  >white</b> (equivalent to <b  >#ffffff</b>)
or <b  >black</b> (equivalent to
<b  >#000</b>), as in the above example. To get a list of
color names X knows about, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>showrgb</b></span> command. These two methods
have been available in the X system since its first public release
and are somewhat limited.</p><p>In release 5 of X11, new methods were added. One of the main
problems with the older method is that a color specified in the
3-digit format, which provides only 4 bits for each primary color,
may work fine for a display with an 8-bit color depth, but on a
16-bit or 24-bit display it will not look right. For example,
<b  >#fff</b> will display as bright white on an 8-bit
display, but will be an off-white (<b  >#f0f0f0</b>) on
displays with 16- or 24-bits/pixel. You can get around this as I
did above by always using at least 6-digit color specifications or
using the new Xcms <b  >RGB</b> method,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
RGB:f/f/f
</pre><p>which automatically expands to <b  >#ffffff</b> for
displays of more than 8-bits/pixel. As with the original method, 1
to 4 hexadecimal digits are specified for each color. But with the
new method, you can use a different number of digits for each.
Instead of being taken as absolute numbers, the digits are used as
scaling factors. For example, a single digit <b  >9</b>
represents 9/15, and <b  >09</b> represents 9/255.
</p><p>If you don't like using hexadecimal digits, you can use the
RGBi (RGB intensity) format, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
RGBi:1.0/1.0/1.0
</pre><p>That will also produce a bright white. The values for red,
green and blue are specified as floating point numbers between 0.0
and 1.0, inclusive. There are also other, much more complex color
spaces such as TekHVC (hue, value, chroma) and several CIE formats.

xdm, so I want to tie up a few loose ends before covering how to
start xdm automatically.</p><p>One file you might want to take a look at is one named by the
<b  >DisplayManager*session</b> resource in xdm-config.
This file (Xsession) is yet another script. It is run by xdm to
create the user's X session. Typically, it defines the file
.xsession-errors in the user's home directory to be the error log
file for X programs (the &ldquo;clients&rdquo; of the client-server
architecture). The .xsession-errors file is truncated to avoid
confusion with errors that happened in the previous session, then
both standard output and standard error output is redirected to it.
In addition to your xdm error file, the .xsession-errors file is a
good place to check for clues if your X session is not starting
properly.</p><p>Next, the file .xsession in the user's home directory is
executed. From the user's perspective, xdm uses the .xsession file
in the same way startx uses .xinitrc. However, there are a couple
of differences. First, .xinitrc must be a shell script, but
.xsession can be any executable program (and must have its execute
bit set). This allows for additional flexibility, although
.xsession will usually be a shell script that is very similar (and
possibly identical) to .xinitrc. It is possible to make one a
symbolic link to the other to simplify management and to ensure
that startx and xdm both create the same working
environment.</p><p>Second, when the X session is started by xdm, the user has
not yet started a login shell, and the shell's startup scripts
(e.g., .bash_profile and .bashrc) have not been run. Because of
this, it is necessary to set (in .xsession) those environment
variables, such as PATH, that must be available for any programs
run from .xsession or any window manager or other program started
from that script.</p><p>I've just briefly described the default behavior of the
/etc/xdm/Xsession script. Usually it is left alone, and
customization on a per-user basis is done with the .xsession
program in the user's home directory. However, it is also possible
to create system-wide customizations by modifying Xsession.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c9580.0x17d09b0"></a>Running xdm Automatically</h2></div></div><p>After you have used xdm from root's command line to
successfully start an X session, the next step is to run xdm
automatically during system initialization. This can be done in
several different ways. I will describe three&mdash;the normal way, an
odd way and a weird way. Take a look at your /etc/inittab file. You
should find these two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault:
x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
</pre><p>The first line sets the default runlevel to 3 (full
multi-user mode, with networking) when the system is booted, and
the second tells the init process to run xdm when the system's
runlevel is 5. On some Linux systems, such as Slackware, this may
be 4.
</p><p>The normal way to have the system run xdm automatically is by
changing the first line to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:5:initdefault:
</pre><p>This will cause the system to boot to runlevel 5 instead of
runlevel 3. In the second line, &ldquo;respawn&rdquo; tells init that if xdm
exits, to immediately restart it. Startup scripts will be run from
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d rather than /etc/rc.d/rc3.d. This means if you have
configured your runlevel 3 daemons just the way you want them, you
will have to do it again for runlevel 5.
</p><p>If that seems like too much bother, use the odd method and
change the second line instead of the first one, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
x:3:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
</pre><p>This will start up the xdm process in runlevel 3 instead of
runlevel 5, preserving your runlevel setup.
</p><p>Finally, the weird way is to start xdm like any other daemon
process and ignore the /etc/inittab file entirely. Add a script to
the directory /etc/rc.d/init.d that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/X.init - Start X Window System
echo "Starting X Window Services: xdm"
/usr/X11/bin/xdm
</pre><p>Then, put a symbolic link to the script in the directory
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d. When the system is booted, init runs these scripts
in the same alphanumerically sorted order that the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command would display them. On
my system, I put in a link called S97X that causes X to be started
after almost everything else. Take a look at the other files in the
rc3.d directory (using <b  >ls -l</b>) and follow their
examples. This method can be handy, because it doesn't restart xdm
each time xdm exits, and sometimes that might be desired. A simpler
way to do the same thing using inittab is by typing the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
x:3:once:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
</pre>


One note of caution is needed here. The /etc/inittab file is one of
the most critical files on your system. If you mess up your inittab
file, your system may not be able to boot, so maybe that weird
method isn't so bad after all.
