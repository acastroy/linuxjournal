    Setting up computing facilities at a Maylasian university
    was easy using Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe70580.0xf684a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>My involvement with Linux began in 1994
when a friend of mine bought the complete set of Slackware
diskettes for me. At that time, I was setting up computing
facilities in Sir Syed University, Pakistan. Linux was set up as
the first e-mail server on campus and was later given the role of
web server by the system manager (http://www.ssuet.edu.pk/).
Sometime thereafter, I assumed a faculty position at the
International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). IIUM recently
moved to a new 700-acre campus and has a modern fiber-optic 155Mbps
ATM core network serving completely switched segments in various
faculties. The responsibility of upgrading and organizing the
computer labs at the Faculty of Engineering was given to me as the
Computer Coordinator.

</p><p>I set up two clusters of 70 new computers, all Dell PII
machines served by two dual-CPU servers. In one lab, a Windows NT
server was set up to provide Windows applications and printing
services for students. In the other cluster, I installed and
configured the server as a dual boot machine. By default, the
server boots into Linux, providing user authentication via NIS and
user home directories via NFS. In case of Windows NT PDC (primary
domain controller) failure, the NIS server can be booted as a
backup PDC NT server.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3087f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe70580.0xf68978"></a>Server Setup</h2></div></div><p>Since the Dell RAID controller is unsupported, we had to
exchange the RAID controller for a tape backup unit so that Linux
can recognize the hard disks. The
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> print command now produces
the output shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3087l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>In order to set up the NIS server, called garden, we had to
overcome many minor problems. Using the search facilities at
Dejanews (http://www.deja.com/), solutions were quickly obtained
from discussions posted on Usenet. The problem of shadow passwords
was resolved by using the <span   class="bold"><b>pwconv</b></span>
command to disable shadowing. One handy method to check whether NIS
is working correctly is to issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ypserv -d
</pre><p>This prints all the debugging information when an NIS client
tries to authenticate a user account.
</p><p>SMP was easily enabled by uncommenting the
<b  >SMP=3D1</b> line in the Makefile and recompiling the
kernel. The 128MB RAM was recognized by Linux once I added an
<b  >append=3Dmem=3D128M</b> line to the /etc/lilo.conf
file and executed /sbin/lilo. Any spaces in this line cause it to
go unnoticed.</p><p>I exported /home via NFS for two purposes. One was to provide
the NIS users with home directories, and the other reason was to
enable them to view important announcements. For this purpose, the
following line was added to the profile of users:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /home/motd
</pre><p>I configured a separate PII machine, called jasmine, as an
applications server. Jasmine provides applications via NFS,
including VLSI layout tools, Netscape, Scilab, GNUplot, Ghostview
and others. In order to be an efficient NFS server for 30 PII
clients, jasmine does not take part in NIS. A third Linux server, a
Pentium, was configured to serve as the faculty e-mail and web
server (http://eng.iiu.edu.my/).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe70580.0xf68ef8"></a>Client Setup</h2></div></div><p>All 30 PII clients in the cluster are dual-boot-configured to
reduce the annoyance of Windows loyalists. Since the lab manager
was not interested in learning Linux, I had to give him a cookbook
of actions to transform a machine booted with Linux into an NIS
client station. What follows is the recipe for NIS client
setup.</p><p>After setting up a basic Linux system with the proper NIC
driver, copy the following files from the &ldquo;model&rdquo; client:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/hosts  {To avoid setting up DNS service
     in localized cluster}
/etc/profile  {To set up paths and issue initial
     commands for an NIS user}
/etc/host.conf  {To set up the host lookup order
     with NIS}
/etc/defaultdomain {To set up NIS domain name}
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 {To start ypbind using
     /etc/defaultdomain as domain name}
/etc/fstab   {To import NFS directories into
     existing mount points}
</pre><p>Add a line containing &ldquo;+&rdquo; to /etc/passwd, /etc/group and
/etc/shadow files. Reboot and log in as a &ldquo;test&rdquo; NIS user to
verify functionality.
</p><p>This cookbook worked perfectly, as the manager was able to
fire up NIS clients without needing to know the setup details.
Later, a booting message was added for the convenience of users, so
they are informed of the dual boot-property of the clients. All
that is necessary is adding a few lines to the /etc/lilo.conf
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#start LILO global section
boot=/dev/sda
message=/boot/boot.msg
prompt
timeout=100
</pre><p>The boot.msg file contains the following text:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Type "linux" or "nt" to boot into operating
system of your choice.
</pre>


To set up the X Window System, I turned to XSuSE
(http://www.suse.de/XSuSE/XSuSE_E.html) as they have the largest
set of drivers for various cards. Accepting the default choices for
most of the questions, I was able to start X quickly by filling in
the proper card type, monitor <b  >hsync</b> and
<b  >vsync</b> values and video RAM size.
</p><p>Instead of changing the path in the global profile each time
an application is added, I included the path
/usr/local/apps/cad/bin in the profile. In this directory, I use
shell scripts or symbolic links to add new applications. If an
application needs to be run from its home directory, a shell script
with the application's name will run from this path. For example,
the application <span   class="bold"><b>exchek</b></span> shell
script contains the following lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/apps/exchek
/usr/local/apps/exchek/exchek
</pre><p>An alternate approach is to use symbolic links. For example,
a symbolic link for Netscape was created with the following
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /usr/local/apps/netscape/netscape netscape
</pre>

senior-level course ECE4330 VLSI Design. This course would have
gone without any true labs, as the commercial VLSI (very large
scale integration) layout tools are too expensive for us. I set up
the MAGIC VLSI layout editor under X and supplemented it with SPICE
(simulations program with integrated circuits emphasis) for small
layout simulation and verification. As there is no licensing
problem, students could use these tools simultaneously on several
workstations.</p><p>After coming across articles in the January 1998
<i  >LJ</i> about PVM (parallel virtual machine), I set
up the PVM web course server on one of the Linux machines. I
divided the students into several groups and allocated two Linux
machines to each group. Their target was to set up one machine as
the master and the other as the slave in a PVM environment, then
test various programs. Although the students could not succeed
fully in running various programs, they enjoyed working on such
important concepts with full control over the computers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe70580.0xf69688"></a>Current Projects</h2></div></div><p>My current projects include setting up a filtering firewall
using Red Hat Linux and binding an HP workstation cluster to the
Linux NIS server for user account authentication. Thus, we will be
able to stop some wasteful use of the Internet, as well as provide
centralized accounts for all UNIX users.</p></div></div>
