line without going through the telco, i.e., going from the phone
line connector of one modem to the other with a twisted pair
(reversed)? It seems this should work and I think I know the
correct AT commands, but I can't get it to work and nobody seems to
know the answer. I am not talking about a null modem cable. I want
to use this to test out PPP server setups. Thanks for any
information.  &mdash;William Strickfaden, xws99@hotmail.com</p><p>This depends on your modems. The phone company normally
provides line voltage that modems modulate with their signals to
talk to one another. Some modems have been known to work without
this voltage, but before you go that route, you can look for a
&ldquo;phone-line simulator&rdquo;. This device will provide the line voltage
and will even ring one end when the other picks up. They're usually
not too expensive, or if you're a hobbyist, you can try to build
one. Many circuit encyclopedias have simple circuits which do
that.</p><p>This is the only option. LAN signals have voltage supplied by
the devices on each side. You cannot do the same thing with phone
connections just by reversing the wires.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,

I've been through DejaNews and talked to the Red Hat PPP guru, but
so far no luck.</p><p>Also, my employer uses SecurID to form part of the password,
so it is literally impossible for me to have a static password
entry in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets. Is there
any way to accommodate passwords that are generated through
SecurID? &mdash;Steve Masticola, masticol@scr.siemens.com</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>dip</b></span> program has
scripting features that include explicit support for SecurID cards.
It even understands about the static and variable parts of SecurID
passwords, with support for both pieces independently. The script
simply says:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
securidf fixedpart
</pre><p>to store the fixed part. Later, the script
says</p><pre     class="programlisting">
securid

the script stop and prompt you for the variable part, and then dip
sends the combined parts to the server.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

</p><p>Try using <span   class="bold"><b>seyon</b></span> or

first time on a partitioned disk (486 system). Immediately after I
switch on the message, &ldquo;Lil&rdquo; comes up and the system stops. When
I use a floppy boot, it is all right. Should I reinstall Linux
again, or can I configure properly after it is booted through the
floppy? The other partition is Windows 95. I want both options to
be displayed while booting. Please help.  &mdash;Manilal,
chirakkal@yahoo.com</p><p>You must have had a problem with configuring LILO during the
Red Hat install. One possible reason is that your root partition
crosses the 1024 cylinder boundary on your disk, and this prevents
LILO from booting. There are many other possible problems with IDE
disks and the different kinds of translations that your BIOS may be
able to do (CHS or LBA head translation). I suggest you try
different settings in the BIOS and the linear option for LILO. Also
refer to the following LILO HOWTOs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Linux system that will allow me to transfer a 5GB file from the
drive to Linux format, so that I can process the data in the UNIX
world. I have found a read-only NTFS drive that is under
development, but I could not get it to compile. I get an error on a
<span   class="bold"><b>time_t</b></span> call. I've tried to use FTP
to transfer the file, but it goes so slow I'm afraid it would take
a week to do the transfer. I also tried to FTP the file to my
RS/6000, but that consistently dies at 1.2GB. If I try to use the
SAMBA interface, the transfer dies at about 500Mb.</p><p>I've also installed AWK on the NT box, but it goes so slow
that I can't believe the NT box will stay up long enough to
complete the transfer. Help!  &mdash;Algis Posius,
algis@pacbell.net</p><p>The 2.2.x kernels already have support for both read/write in
NTFS partitions. Even though I've never tried to copy that amount
of data, it seems stable enough for the task. Just one question: do
you have 5GB of data or a 5GB file? If you have a 5GB file, you are
out of luck. The 32-bit version of Linux (and AIX also) can address
files only up to 2GB.  &mdash;Mario Bittencourt, mneto@argo.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d92580.0x1e8adf0"></a>Choosing the Right Commands</h2></div></div><p>I'm trying to configure my Red Hat 6.0 system to allow
clients to access CD-ROM images from my Linux server hard drives.
After looking at various file systems such as Samba and NFS and
commands such as MAKEDEV, vnconfig, mount, smbmount etc., I'm
getting confused as to which combinations of commands to use.  &mdash;Mark
J. Foucht, mark.foucht@eds.com</p><p>Red Hat 6.0 uses <span   class="bold"><b>knfsd</b></span>,
which works somewhat differently compared to the old userland NFS
server. One big difference is that you have to export each file
system mounted in order for clients to see them (with the old
server, you could just <b  >export= /</b>, and clients
would have a view on all your file systems).</p><p>In your case, if your CD-ROM is mounted under /mnt/cdrom, put
the following in your /etc/exports file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/mnt/cdrom (ro)
</pre><p>Then, type the following to migrate the entry to
/var/lib/nfs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/xtab
moremagic:~# exportfs -av
exporting :/mnt/cdrom
</pre><p>To see if it worked, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moremagic:~# showmount -e localhost
Export list for localhost:
/mnt/cdrom (everyone)
</pre><p>To mount from another machine, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /mnt/remotecd
mount remotemachinename:/mnt/cdrom /mnt/remotecd
</pre><p> &mdash;Marc Merlin, merlin@varesearch.com</p><p>If your CD-ROM will be used by Windows computers, you should
use Samba. Here is the entry you can add to your /etc/smb.conf
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[CDROM]
comment = CDROM
path = /mnt/cdrom
read only = yes
guest ok = yes
case sensitive = no
mangle case = yes
preserve case = yes
</pre><p>You should restart Samba after modifying the file.
Just type as root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart
</pre><p>If you want to make it accessible to NFS users (UNIX
computers), you should add the line <b  >/mnt/cdrom</b>
to your /etc/exports and restart your NFS daemon by using
<b  >/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs restart</b>.  &mdash;Pierre Ficheux,

Presarion CDS 526 (486 66MHz). Believe it or not, I had no trouble
getting it loaded on my machine. I do have a problem with my RAM
memory. When I do the <span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span>
command, it shows I have only 15MB of memory, when I actually have
36MB. Why is this? Is it a problem that has been corrected in a
more current kernel, or is it more of a hardware problem?</p><p>My next question concerns the world of parallel computing. I
have a new computer on order (P3 500MHz), and when I get it, I will
be installing Linux on it as well as the one mentioned above. I am
interested in hobbying in the world of parallel computing, and I
wondered if it would do any good trying to run parallel with a
500MHz machine and a 66MHz machine, or will the whole thing run
slower? Thanks for your help.  &mdash;John,
johnwtaylor2@hotmail.com</p><p>This 36MB you've mentioned is a rather &ldquo;non-standard&rdquo;
amount of memory. Please use a
<span   class="bold"><b>dmesg</b></span> command to see how much
memory it finds during boot time.  &mdash;Mario Bittencourt,
mneto@argo.com.br</p><p>There is a kernel option for limiting the memory to 16MB;
maybe it is activated in your current kernel. You should recompile
a new kernel without this option, in &ldquo;General Setup&rdquo;: Limit
memory to low 16MB (CONFIG_MAX_16M) [N/y/?] N &mdash;Pierre Ficheux,
pficheux@com1.fr</p><p>On your second question, it will depend on how you do it.
Think of a job jar, representing a problem decomposed into
independent jobs. Each CPU grabs a job out of the jar when it's
finished with the previous job. With good choices of job sizes, you
win. If the jobs are too small, the extra communication and
coordination overhead negates the gains from the slower CPU. If too
large, the faster CPU will finish first and have to wait for the
slower one to finish&mdash;and it may end up waiting longer than if it
had done all the work itself. You may have to experiment to find
good job sizes, though the obvious computation based on the two
systems' relative speeds should get you in the right
neighborhood.</p><p>I'd recommend you start by looking into PVM, the Parallel
Virtual Machine system. Find PVM
