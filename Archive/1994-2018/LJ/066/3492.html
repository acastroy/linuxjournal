    Designing a new library for processing large images using a
    minimal amount of memory.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed1450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Library design is an imprecise art. It
would be impractical to include in a design all possible uses for a
library of any sufficient size or complexity. Thus, it is
inevitable that many libraries (and programs) reach evolutionary
dead ends, where newly anticipated uses or algorithms can no longer
fit nicely into the existing architecture.
</p><p>The quickest short term solution is usually to hack in new
interfaces, but over time the accumulation of hacks tends to reduce
the stability, understandability and maintainability of code. The
software industry comes up against this problem often, but
fortunately has found a simple yet elegant solution&mdash;start over.
Usually, rewriting lower- to middle-level interfaces can remove the
accumulation of hacks. However, if the design criteria in question
are incorporated throughout the code, sometimes only a total
rewrite can truly help.</p><p>This is not solely a trait of software design. Software
engineering is an expression of mathematics in a confined space
(your computer). Through this heritage, it shares traits with other
inexact sciences such as physics, where rewriting or reworking
theories is not uncommon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed1608"></a>Starting Over</h2></div></div><p>During the last five years, I've written many
image-processing algorithms, from specialized routines for machine
vision to complete libraries for commercial video and aerial
image-processing software. The last commercial library has been in
use for three years and has weathered many interface changes and
enhancements. But just as each library was in some ways an
improvement over previous attempts, I saw ways to improve
performance and capability. Following in the footsteps of the
makers of the six million dollar man&mdash;I wanted to make it faster,
smarter and better than before and at significantly reduced cost.
</p><p>My commercial library had a large amount of code tied to it,
so simply modifying the existing code was not an option. It seemed
as if I would never be able to incorporate a new library into my
commercial work because of enormous design incompatibilities.
Rather than have this new library be destined to collect electronic
dust on my hard drive, I decided to start completely from scratch
as open source. In late November 1998, the Large Image Manipulation
Program (LIMP) was born.</p><p>It's likely that even as open source, this library would have
been inconspicuous enough to draw little, if any, attention.
However, after a few months spent developing LIMP in my spare time,
Open Source Remote Sensing (OSRS,
<a href="http://remotesensing.org" target="_self">http://remotesensing.org/</a>)
was born. I was thrilled at the thought of having an open source
library that was actually useful to someone, so LIMP was moved to
OSRS for public development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed1818"></a>Speed, Ease of Use and Memory</h2></div></div><p>The purpose of LIMP is to allow the processing of large
images using a minimal amount of memory. A number of available
libraries can be used for image processing, any of which could be
used to give identical results. The differences between these
libraries can often be summed up by answering a few
questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Can the data be processed on demand, or must all
the processed data be in memory or on disk?</p></li><li><p>How easy is it to write new algorithms for the
library?</p></li><li><p>How efficient is it?</p></li></ul></div><p>The simplest image processing library would first allow
loading an image into memory, then provide pixel-level access to
the data (read and write), and finally allow storing the data back
to disk. Advantages of such a scheme include a simple set of
interfaces and (given enough memory or small enough images) nearly
optimal computational efficiency. Disadvantages include high memory
usage and therefore poor scaling with image size or number of
images.
</p><p>If memory usage is not a problem, this would be the optimal
way of dealing with images. Unfortunately, memory cannot yet be
considered infinite for many image-processing demands. As an
example, the very first test of my last commercial library was to
load 1200 images consisting of 300 gigabytes of data and display
them at once. Actual processing was done in blocks of images to
avoid having a failure wipe out weeks of processing time. In an
attempt to avoid repeating historical blunders, I would never say
that no one will ever have several hundred gigabytes of memory. I
imagine when that time comes, people will work with even larger
data sets.</p><p>In handling large images, many proprietary libraries reduce
memory usage by sacrificing ease of use and efficiency. Great
lengths can be taken to reduce the loss, but all such libraries are
at a slight disadvantage in these areas and LIMP is no
exception.</p><p>By learning from past experiences, many interfaces in LIMP
have been designed to promote speed-enhancing optimizations as well
as to group complex code into a few internal locations, where they
can be more easily maintained. Because complex code is grouped into
reusable templates, many types of functions and conversions can be
written without having to deal with any complexity that would
normally be encountered in large image processing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed1ce8"></a>Design Decisions</h2></div></div><p>LIMP is almost pure C++, as is most of the code I've written
in the last several years. My feeling is the compiler should do as
much of the work as possible, allowing the programmer to focus on
higher-level concepts. C++ is certainly not the holy grail of
programming, but I feel that using an object-oriented language is
much simpler then manually approximating an object-oriented
interface in a non-object-oriented language. After all, everyone
knows all computer languages can be reduced to assembly language;
it is just a matter of how much work you have to do vs. how much
the compiler does for you.</p><p>The Qt library
(<a href="http://www.troll.no" target="_self">www.troll.no</a>) is
used as both a widget set and a template library. Since all of the
core library is independent of the display subsystem, a library
such as STL could have been used, but Qt is better documented with
no inconsistencies between platforms. I also intended to write
graphical interfaces using the core libraries, so Qt was a natural
choice.</p><p>Plug-in types are used for a number of interfaces. This makes
it easy to add new implementations without changing existing code.
Image loading, saving and serialization are accomplished using
plug-in interfaces. Simple interpolation filters are also
implemented this way. The plug-in manager is very generic and can
handle plug-ins of any type. This also makes it possible to add
run-time loading of external plug-ins, although this feature is not
yet implemented.</p><p>An image in LIMP is nothing more than a class for caching and
moving data. By itself, an image does not produce, or in any way
modify, the data. All production and processing steps are performed
in &ldquo;layers&rdquo;. An image can contain any number of layers, but the
minimum for useful work is one&mdash;the source layer. This layer
normally corresponds to some type of file loader (e.g., tiff), but
can also be a simpler type such as an in-memory buffer, a
constant-value image, or anything that can produce an image from
scratch. In order to deal with large images efficiently, all data
should be produced or loaded on-demand.</p><p>Other layers could perform such functions as data format
conversion, radiometric or geometric transforms, and mosaics by
combining multiple images. A number of data-type conversions are
predefined (e.g., from RGB to YCbCr or RGB to gray-scale), and many
other conversions can be easily defined. When processing layers are
added to an image, everything about the image can be affected. The
2-D properties (width/height) can change, or the depth (samples per
pixel, pixel data type, etc.) could be modified. For example, one
class that modifies 2-D size is the zoom layer, which produces a
new virtual image that is a magnification of an existing one. This
can be used not only for zooming in on a visual image, but for
up-sampling nearly any supported type.</p><p>By design, as much processing as possible is moved into an
assembly-line approach. The basic unit for loading and processing
data is a tile. All requests for data are made to an
<b  >Image</b> class, where it is broken up into tiles
for processing. By determining which tiles are needed ahead of
time, additional optimizations can be performed (for example,
reordering the tile requests to optimize data cache hits). Each
tile is processed and the ones not in the cache are created. All
the complexity of chaining together layers of various types is
dealt with by the <b  >Image</b> class, which simplifies
layer construction. When the time comes for a layer to process a
given tile, it is presented with the input data space already
filled and the output data space already allocated; therefore, it
only has to process the pixels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed20b0"></a>Current Status</h2></div></div><p>Linux is the primary development platform; however, efforts
are being made to keep the library portable to other platforms. The
GNU auto-configure tools are used to test for required system
characteristics. LIMP is known to build on Red Hat/ix86 5.2,
Irix/Mips 6.3, and Red Hat/Alpha 5.2&mdash;each using
<span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span> 1.1.2.</p><p>Support exists for tiff images in a variety of formats;
scan-line tiff, as well as tiled tiff, are supported. Color and
gray-scale capability is known to work, but the tiff layer also
supports a number of other formats including shorts, floats and
doubles, as well as multi-channel types. Recent work by others,
notably Frank Warmerdam, has resulted in support for other image
formats by bridging to his open source GDAL library.</p><p>Many optimizations that have been designed for LIMP are not
yet fully realized. This is not to say that LIMP is slow in its
current state, but room for improvement exists within design specs.
Already, some optimizations have been added which could be
difficult to add in other architectures. For example, LIMP
implements data-request optimizations that reorder requests to make
optimal use of the image cache. Most of the optimizations are done
internally, so the calling objects benefit from the optimizations
without adding any extra complexity.</p><p>Today, LIMP is meant primarily for developers. The only thing
usable for non-programmers is its image viewing program
(<span   class="bold"><b>imgview</b></span>).
<span   class="bold"><b>imgview</b></span> is a simple display tool,
capable of viewing very large images quickly and without needing
much memory. It takes user interface ideas from other
image-processing tools to allow options such as dragging the canvas
while updating the display in the background. It also supports a
number of zoom filters for smoothing upsampled (i.e., enlarged)
image data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed23c8"></a>Future Work</h2></div></div><p>What LIMP does now is only the tip of the iceberg. The basic
foundation has been laid, but many algorithms remain to be written.
Every area of LIMP will most likely receive extensions as work
progresses. Of course, the people who contribute to LIMP and OSRS
are the people who will drive the development. I will outline some
of the planned work to give ideas of the kinds of things I believe
would be useful. This is not an all-inclusive list, as there are
likely many interesting features which have yet to occur to
me.</p><p>Support for geographic information needs to be added at some
level to allow applications to learn how images are related to the
real world and each other. This is a basic requirement for
high-level GIS programs. It may not be necessary to put this
information directly into LIMP, but the metadata information in an
image provides a potentially convenient way of storing and
retrieving such information.</p><p>The classes from LIMP's image viewer will be extended to
handle multiple overlapping images as well as vector data. This is
also somewhat detached from the core of LIMP, because it would
create a new display pipeline. The image display class already
consists of a sophisticated drawing class, which is capable of
ordering and computing tiles for the display with minimal impact on
the GUI. This impact can be reduced to almost nothing once Qt
supports threaded event handling.</p><p>A wide variety of radiometric image adjustments will be
useful. These will start as simple histogram stretches for viewing,
and progress to more complex color and intensity modifications.
This type of modification should add very little extra overhead to
LIMP, as it was designed specifically to minimize the procedural
and computational overhead of such objects.</p><p>For a more complete list of expected modifications to LIMP,
see the TODO file in the LIMP distribution. Similarly, if you are
interested in the progress, see the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd9580.0xed2630"></a>Target Audience</h2></div></div><p>As with most libraries that cater to processing extremes,
LIMP is not destined for a mass-market audience. Good solutions for
dealing with similar image-processing demands, such as editing,
already exist. The problems facing a designer of a general editing
program, where every pixel may be changed interactively, are not
driving our choices. Instead, LIMP is designed to deal well with
scientific image-processing needs. In this category, I am most
familiar with aerial and satellite image processing, but I imagine
other fields have similar needs.</p><p>Images for the GIS market typically cover a large area with a
relatively low image scale. One obvious potential parallel in
another field would be small area images with higher image
scales&mdash;as might be found in microscopy work. As everyone who has
played with a fractal generator knows, if you zoom into an object
far enough, the original object seen at that scale covers an
incredibly immense area.</p><p>Aerial and satellite images have come to be processed and
stored on computers only in recent history. As computers become
more powerful and capable of accessing larger amounts of data, new
attempts will undoubtedly be made to process and understand
exponentially larger sets of data at even finer resolutions. LIMP
is not expected to be a final answer to these problems, but is just
an experiment in dealing with them while maintaining performance,
ease of use and the sanity of its programmers.</p></div></div>
