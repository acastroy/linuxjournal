for a network kit for a project of mine, when I spotted the Fast
Ethernet Network Starter Kit from Linksys. What caught my eye was
that Linux was mentioned right on the box. As I didn't have the
list of Ethernet cards known to work under Linux with me, I decided
to take the words on the box at face value and give it a try.
</p><p>The kit includes two EtherFast 10/100 PCI LAN cards, two
15-foot category 5 UTP cables, an AC power adapter for your hub and
a 4-port 100Mbps fast Ethernet hub. The kit also comes with an
instruction booklet and drivers for Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51,
Windows NT 4.0 and NetWare. This is all good, I thought, dreaming
of the fun experiments I would have with SAMBA; however, I bought
the kit because it promised compatibility with Linux (albeit listed
in the &ldquo;Others&rdquo; category on the box).</p><p>I didn't see Linux mentioned in the instruction booklet, so I
took a look at their web site
(<a href="http://www.linksys.com" target="_self">http://www.linksys.com/</a>).
In the FAQ, I found
<a href="http://www.linksys.com/support/solution/nos/linux.htm" target="_self">www.linksys.com/support/solution/nos/linux.htm</a>
(and freebsd.htm too, for our free UNIX brethren).</p><p>The amount of Linux information on their web site has grown
since I first looked at it, but this is probably not your best
resource. They mention, for example, that if you're installing Red
Hat 5.2, you should choose the
<span   class="bold"><b>Tulip</b></span> driver from the list of
drivers on your screen. While this isn't bad advice, it might give
the false impression that you need to re-install Linux to get your
Ethernet card to work. They also mention the driver has been tested
under SuSE, Caldera, Slackware and Debian, when use of the driver
is, of course, absolutely distribution independent.</p><p>The tulip.c driver is supplied on one of the floppies in the
kit, and there is a link to the most up-to-date version. This
version is found on the CESDIS (Center of Excellence in Space Data
and Information Sciences) web site and, like so many Linux Ethernet
drivers, is written by Donald Becker. In my opinion, your best
resource for the driver is
<a href="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html" target="_self">cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html</a>.
Also, Greg Siekas deserves a mention for his very clear
instructions found at
<a href="http://www.bmen.tulane.edu/~siekas/tulip.html" target="_self">www.bmen.tulane.edu/~siekas/tulip.html</a>.
This page also has information on different options for people
compiling the tulip driver for different cards.</p><p><a href="3456l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>In order to get instructions on compiling the driver,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tail tulip.c
</pre><p>The output is shown in Listing 1. Notice there is a slightly
different syntax for SMP (more than one processor). Most people
will want to use something like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -DMODVERSIONS -DMODULES -D__KERNEL__\
-I/usr/src/linux/net/inet -Wall\
-Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c tulip.c
</pre>


Next, append this information to the /etc/conf.modules file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias eth0 tulip
options tulip options=11 debug=0
</pre>


Setting <b  >options</b> to 11 sets the media type to MII
autoselect, and setting <b  >debug</b> to 0 suppresses
the debug messages. Set <b  >debug=6</b> if you want to
obtain the very wordy debug messages.
</p><p>Finally, copy the object file to the latest kernel's
modules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp tulip.o /lib/modules/2.X.XX
</pre><p>and update the kernel dependencies:
<pre     class="programlisting">
depmod -a
</pre>


If you are using the driver in a monolithic kernel, then copy
tulip.c to the /usr/src/linux/drivers/net directory and recompile
the kernel.
</p><p>The Linksys Starter Kit performed beautifully under Linux and
I haven't had any problems using it with some older PCs, but be
aware that you can't set the IRQs with a switch. Your best bet is
to use a fairly modern PC with an up-to-date BIOS that can
automatically configure your card's parameters.</p><p>My only complaint with this kit is a minor one&mdash;I find the
4-port hub to be a bit limiting. You can uplink the hub with
others, but doing so makes port number 1 unavailable for a PC.
However, Linksys now has a new Network Starter Kit which includes a
5-port hub (FENSK05).</p><p>I imagine Linksys is targeting home users wishing to do some
networked gaming and to connect more than one computer to the
Internet at a time. Toward this end, Linksys has a special offer
which includes a two-user version of Virtual Motion's Internet
LanBridge with the kit. I would like to point out to new Linux
users that Linux can be used for free to connect many computers,
running any operating system, to one dial-up account.</p><p>In short, I have no problem recommending the Linksys starter
kit to Linux users. You should be prepared to do a little more work
than expected by people from the plug-and-play world. It is nice to
see a growing number of companies which are starting to support
Linux users.</p></div></div>
