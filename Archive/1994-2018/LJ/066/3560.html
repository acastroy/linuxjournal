shares little more than a name with the 1st edition and is, I
think, vastly improved. The apparent focus is an introduction to
Linux for a user of Microsoft Windows, with explicit instructions
and many screen snapshots. Other than far too many typos, it
appears to be a success. The book contains a CD-ROM with Red Hat
Linux 5.2 for an Intel X86 PC, and a tear-out &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo;
containing names and brief descriptions of some useful commands.
The UNIX novice will probably use it to look at the description,
then read the man page for the command syntax.</p><p>The first 30 pages introduce Linux, give a brief history and
describe some of what an experienced user can do with it&mdash;all
designed to convince a possibly reluctant person to try it.</p><p>The next 90 pages are what the average reader would expect
from a &ldquo;... for Dummies&rdquo; book&mdash;an MS Windows user is led
step-by-step in installing Linux, after first determining whether
the computer is comprised of hardware on which Linux can run.
Assuming the user is na&iuml;ve regarding computers, Hall describes
how to use MS Windows, including screen dumps as illustrations, to
determine what hardware is in the computer system. So, in many
cases, the user learns more about how to use a familiar OS in his
attempt to install Linux. This builds confidence and is a good
instructional technique.</p><p>Next, writing boot and supplemental floppies from the
included CD using rawrite.exe, defragmenting, repartitioning with
FIPS and <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> are covered.
Naturally, Hall recommends using a separate disk for Linux so that
repartitioning for Linux is not necessary. Many screen dumps are
provided for the installation procedure, including both Disk Druid
and fdisk. Configuring a mouse, the X Window System, networking,
setting the system clock, setting boot services, choosing a root
password, creating a boot floppy disk to boot the system one has
just installed, and configuring the bootstrap loader, LILO, are
described. Because the X Window System is so important to the rest
of the development, a chapter is included on &ldquo;Solving Problems
with the X Window System Installation&rdquo;. Adding a user through the
control panel in X is shown, because that is the most likely method
of choice for MS Windows users. Hall does include a page on adding
users from the command line, and I have to admit I was surprised to
see the command for that was not
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> but rather
<span   class="bold"><b>useradd</b></span>. Then I realized this
change parallels the terminology of the X Window User Configurator.
Awkward, but it works!</p><p>The next 100 pages introduce files, commands, editors (mostly
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>), shells, using X, calendar,
calculator and configuring a sound card. As of this writing, I have
not yet gotten my old MediaVision Deluxe JAZZ16 sound card to work.
However, I must admit I've spent more time on this review than on
such a frivolity.</p><p>Maintenance is the topic of the next 30 pages: managing the
file system, including mounting and dismounting, adding more disk
storage and using <span   class="bold"><b>mtools</b></span> to work
with MS-DOS floppies (read, write, etc.). Using CD-ROMs in Linux is
discussed in one chapter and tuning the system and building the
kernel in another.</p><p>The next chapter illustrates how to set up a modem and a PPP
connection to one's ISP via X. In particular, one need not worry
about writing involved scripts for PPP as long as one knows the
phone number, the IP address(es) of nameserver(s) and can respond
to the dialog and screen dumps in the book. I tried only PPP, but
the dialog box offers the choice of SLIP, PLIP, Token Ring and
others as well.</p><p>Since one probably wants the PPP connection in order to surf
the Web, the next chapter is all about setting up and using
Netscape. This, too, works nicely using
<span   class="bold"><b>ifup</b></span> in an xterm.</p><p>The obligatory (in every &ldquo;...for Dummies&rdquo; book) &ldquo;Part of
Tens&rdquo; is next. One chapter presents ten sources of help, which
should offer something for everyone; another, ten problem areas and
solutions, usually referred to as FAQs.</p><p>Appendix A is a list of hardware compatible with Linux, B
discusses man pages, and C is a brief description of the
CD-ROM.</p><p>I think Hall did a tremendous job of completely rewriting the
book, but wish he could have had better support, particularly a
technical copy editor. There are just too many typos (or thinkos)
in this book for the leery first-time user to feel totally
confident. I have not had time to find all the problems, but two
follow. One, on page 52, &ldquo;formed&rdquo; is used when referring to a
1.44 MB floppy disk; it is clear the word should have been
&ldquo;formatted&rdquo;. Two, a more serious problem occurs on page 309 in
the problem and solution chapter. When the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command doesn't show files in
color, a solution is offered that is correct in principle, but
wrong in detail. Adding the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls ='ls - color=auto'
</pre><p>to the .bashrc file will not change ls to use color for the
different file types. It is not clear the new user would know
enough to type <b  >man ls</b> to find the correct syntax
to solve the problem.
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls ='ls --color=auto'
</pre>


will work; in fact, leaving off <b  >=auto</b> will also
work for the included Red Hat 5.2 CD-ROM version.
</p><p>I can recommend this book for the person who works with
Microsoft products but wants to try Linux. Despite too many minor
errors and inaccuracies, following the directions in the book will
result in an installed Linux, X and Net connection,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>assuming</em></span> one's hardware is supported (check
the appendix) and one knows the phone number, name servers and
gateway for the ISP.</p><p>Overall, while this is a usable book for installing Linux,
the user should also have <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Dummies, Quick
Reference, 2nd Edition</em></span> by Phil Hughes, to learn the more
common command-line interface instructions with examples.</p><p>I liked this book and hope the next edition will clean up all
the typos and maybe even add a chapter on installing DOSEMU and
Wine. Unlike the first edition, the second is a book that leads the
reader in a step-by-step fashion toward success.</p></div></div>
