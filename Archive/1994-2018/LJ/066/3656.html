    I talked to Lyle Ball of Lineo to find out which rumors
    were true.

announced it was changing its name to Lineo and would be offering
an embedded system product called Embedix, based on Caldera's
OpenLinux. Then the rumors began to fly&mdash;who were they partnering
with? The name heard most often was Motorola. On August 4, under an
NDA until the August 9 announcement, I talked to Lyle Ball of Lineo
to find out which rumors were true. Here's our conversation.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Sounds like exciting
things are going on at Lineo. Tell us about it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: On Monday, we will be
publically announcing a strategic relationship between two Linux
companies. Caldera Systems will be providing Motorola with
OpenLinux for their high-availability network solutions, and for
now, Lineo will be the only company working with Motorola in this
way. We will be providing them with Embedix, which is Lineo's Linux
platform for the embedded market.</p><p>Embedix is exclusively based on OpenLinux, and that
exclusivity works both ways. Caldera Systems will not be partnering
with anyone else in the embedded space and will not be providing
the embedded Linux business&mdash;that will all be taken care of through
Embedix and Lineo. We will not be using anyone else's solution. We
won't, for instance, offer a Red Hat Linux solution as an
alternative. So, from a technology standpoint, we will be taking
Caldera Systems' OpenLinux platform into the Embedix arena. From a
business standpoint, it is Lineo's Embedix that will be branded in
that arena. Is that confusing or clear?</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3656f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Very clear, you said
it well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: The big news here is
that the world's largest provider of embedded technologies,
Motorola, has selected Lineo and Caldera Systems as the software
partners to launch Motorola's aggressive Linux initiative. Motorola
will be providing Linux-based solutions from top to bottom&mdash;from
their larger high-availability solutions all the way down to their
smallest chips. Lineo will be providing the smaller space pieces,
i.e., the embedded software pieces, under the brand name Embedix,
and Caldera Systems will be directly providing the OpenLinux
product for the high-end box, high-availability Linux
solution.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: This really sounds
like hot stuff!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: It is big for us and
we think it is really big for Linux. Companies have invested in
other companies before&mdash;Red Hat has provided great exposure for
Linux in investments. I personally believe this very high-level
delivery of products presents a different perspective. For a
world-leading embedded provider of hardware to make the investment
and the commitment to target Linux&mdash;not just announcing a strategy,
but actually doing it&mdash;is a big story. We will be doing just this
as partners&mdash;actually presenting the products that will be
delivered with their solutions. I'm very excited about Monday
(August 9) and all the Linux news, such as Red Hat going public and
our announcement. I'm sure a ton of other announcements will also
be made at Linux World; it's going to be a very good Linux week. We
are excited to contribute to that with this announcement.</p><p>We have been fighting hard for years. I've been in this for
five years now at Caldera and then on to Lineo, and I'm just very
excited this is coming out&mdash;moving forward.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3656f3.jpg"></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How long have y'all
been working on this embedded thing&mdash;not for five years,
surely!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: Not for five years,
but Lineo has been working on it for some time. The product is in
progress, it's not a philosophy, it's not a white paper, it's
product. If you want to understand our product, a press release I
wrote is at www.lineo.com and talks about renaming Caldera Thin
Clients to Lineo and the Embedix product. Embedix has over 130
components, and many of them are complete. OEMs (original equipment
manufacturers) will build solutions based on any combination of
those components. We already have OEMs working with these&mdash;Motorola
is the first that is ready to announce. In the embedded OEM space,
they don't announce their intention until they basically have the
product done, because they don't want their competitors to know
what they are doing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I have seen your
announcement, and my question is: which OEMs are already signed
up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: We can't say. It's not
like in the software-only arena where Microsoft will vaporware
their product a year and a half before they build it. Because of
their dominance, they can do that. In the hardware arena where
things can be copied so quickly, software components can be added
into existing hardware. They don't want to talk about it until they
are close to shipping it. Motorola is our first OEM to announce,
but it is definitely not our last!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It's definitely a
big one, too. What kinds of tools are included in Embedix?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: In general terms, we
have taken Linux and optimized it for three areas required by OEMs:
memory, storage and performance. We have optimized Linux
technologies, in our case based exclusively on OpenLinux, to meet
the rigorous demands in the restricted embedded space, where
memory, storage and performance are all very critical. For
instance, in the software desktop and PC arena, there is basically
unlimited memory and speed and storage at this point. You can add
on another terabyte or gigabyte, whatever you want&mdash;it costs, but
you can do it. In the embedded space, the idea is how small you can
get it, not how big. It's not how many more Linux packages I can
add to make my product bigger and better than my competitor. It's
how much tighter and smaller I can make my product and still have
it do more than my competitor. It's the exact opposite philosophy
of where Linux has been going in the last few years.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Did you have any
problems with getting it stripped down to size?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: Of course, there were
problems! Engineering is not an easy task! But we feel we are well
ahead of any known competitors. First of all, we don't know of
anyone of significance who has announced their actual product
plans. A couple of small companies have announced they are going to
try embedded Linux initiatives in software. None of them have a
large partner like Motorola, to our knowledge. Again, we might be
surprised on the 9th!</p><p>We do believe we are the first to market with embedded
solutions, and we will aggressively define the embedded Linux
space. We won't be the only one doing that, but we believe we will
be integral to defining that space. And we believe we have a great
chance at maintaining market leadership in that space, because we
have been doing embedded for a few years and Linux for five. It's a
unique evolution for Caldera Thin Clients, where we have a Linux
heritage and a Linux sister company. We also have very deep
experience with embedding DR DOS, and we've been making millions
from that. So we are in a unique position: we are not a startup and
we have funding. Our DOS product paid for all our R&amp;D on
embedded Linux. We have the processes in place, we have the
employees, and we are simply evolving our focus from an embedded
DOS-only company to an embedded Linux company.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Have y'all been
doing this for a while?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: Oh, yes, it's been in
the plans&mdash;just not public. You don't want your competitors to know
everything you are doing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about the name
change? How did you choose Lineo?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: We wanted a name that
was more attached to the Linux environment, because we see a
longer-term demand for Linux from the market. We are not killing
our DOS product immediately; that is, the market is not killing our
DOS product. There is still a high demand for embedded DOS, and we
will continue to sell and market it. However, there has been an
increasing demand for embedded Linux. So we are shifting our focus
and renaming the company to match our longer-term revenue stream,
which will be Linux-based.</p><p>Let me make it clear that we are not abandoning DOS, we are
just shifting as the market has requested us to do. No one said,
&ldquo;Kill DOS now!&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Hey, we need DOS, but, long term we
would really like to have these Linux solutions as well.&rdquo; It will
be up to each individual OEM as to when they will switch over.
Motorola is doing it now, and others will do it later. We will keep
selling both technologies during the transition.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: This may be a rather
obvious question: when Cygnus decided to get into the embedded
business, they did their own operating system and said that Linux
wasn't going to work for them...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: Too bad for
them!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What choices did
y'all go through; did you decide to use Linux just because you had
OpenLinux right there, or did you have other reasons?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lyle</b></span>: Well, one of the
reasons was Caldera Systems has been very effective in building a
solid brand around OpenLinux. OpenLinux is known as &ldquo;Linux for
Business&rdquo;, and it's got this corporate and trusting feel to it.
There may be weaknesses the product has, as all products have
strengths and weaknesses, but its strength is that it has a solid
name in the business community. Caldera has spent&mdash;I don't know if
they have ever disclosed how much&mdash;an insane amount of money in
advertising and other promotion to build Linux itself and OpenLinux
as acceptable in a business setting. Therefore, when we spoke to
our OEM companies&mdash;not just in the U.S., but around Europe and
Asia&mdash;they were interested in our DOS solution and they would also
say, &ldquo;Boy, we would like an OpenLinux-based solution. We would
like to switch to Linux, and we want to switch to a Linux that has
a name and is comfortable and established. That way, we aren't
perceived as bringing something new to the table&mdash;it's an evolution
rather than a startup.&rdquo; So the philosophy is that Caldera Systems
has done a phenomenal job of building market awareness and a solid
brand. Embedix is the business brand that Lineo will build, because
we need our own brand. But it will always be accompanied with the
tag &ldquo;exclusively based on OpenLinux and licensed from Caldera
Systems&rdquo;. Embedix isn't licensed from Caldera Systems; Lineo owns
its enhancements. Just as Red Hat and Caldera Systems always give
credit to Linus for the Linux they have built their systems on, we
will always give credit to OpenLinux for the base. We will call our
additions&mdash;we actually call them &ldquo;additions&rdquo; even though we are
making OpenLinux smaller in size; it's definitely advancements
because it takes a lot of engineering to do so&mdash;our enhancements,
&ldquo;Embedix&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thanks for your
