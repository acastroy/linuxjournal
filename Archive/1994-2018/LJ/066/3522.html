    Side Effects Software pulls the Linux penguin out of its hat
    with a port of Houdini.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3522_spot.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x134f558"></a></h2></div></div><p> We all know about those movies with the
great special effects: <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Armageddon</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The X-Files
Movie</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Godzilla</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lost In
Space</em></span>. The list goes on and on. Up until now, most of
those effects have been done on SGI workstations. SGI has been a
leader in this field for many years. However, in the past few
years, a migration to low-end, low-cost, Intel-based PC hardware
has occurred. This migration has included Windows, the only OS
considered to work well on those Intel desktop computers. That
situation is about to change.
</p><p>Side Effects Software
(<a href="http://www.sidefx.com" target="_self">http://www.sidefx.com/</a>),
a graphics software company founded in 1987 in Toronto, Canada, is
porting its only product, Houdini, to Linux. This is big news in
the graphics world. Houdini is the software used to create many of
the stunning effects in the movies I just mentioned. To those in
the graphics arts world, this is the equivalent of Oracle, Corel or
Lotus porting to Linux. It gives credibility to the platform in an
area where it had been mostly a curiosity.</p><p>Linux has had a major role in a few movies in the past.
Darryl Strauss' article (<i  >LJ</i>, February 1998)
about Digital Domain's Linux render farm for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span> proved that, but Linux hasn't been
used as the primary graphic artist's platform for these movies.
Like so many other industries, the film and video industries have
been using Linux as a server, a box off in the corner happily
crunching numbers or dishing out files over high-speed networks.
Now, Linux gets to take center stage on the desktop.</p><p><a href="3522f3.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot 1.</a></p><p>Side Effects' Houdini product is a complete 3-D solution,
encompassing modeling, compositing, lighting, particle systems,
texture management, rendering and animation features. Currently in
its third release, Houdini was one of the first modeling and
animation products to adopt a procedural approach to 3-D. Recently,
Houdini received an Academy Award for &ldquo;Technical Achievement&rdquo;,
presented to four of the company's original developers. Used by
companies like Digital Domain, Blue Sky/VIFX Studios and
Centropolis Effects, Houdini is a heavyweight in the film
industry.</p><p>Previously, Houdini has been supported only on SGI Irix
workstation class systems. They recently announced support for
Windows NT. The port to Linux comes at a time when many hardware
vendors are looking for reasons to bring their high-end graphics
cards into the Linux fold. Paul Salvini, Director of R&amp;D at
Side Effects Software, talks of it as the &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo;
problem:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Doing a product like this for Linux required
hardware acceleration to make it really viable, but hardware
acceleration often requires applications in order to warrant
drivers to be written. From a graphics workstation point of view,
Linux isn't ready. There haven't been that many proper drivers for
hardware acceleration for OpenGL under Linux. There are a number
under development, but as far as state of the art, there aren't
that many in production. The reason is that there aren't any
applications pushing the need for these drivers. The applications
want the drivers; the drivers are looking for applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>Linux is a viable, popular, rendering platform. Many houses
that formerly used SGI servers for rendering are moving to, or at
least considering, low-cost Linux platforms for their rendering
farms. This might be due to their familiarity with UNIX or concerns
with Windows NT stability or even if they just prefer not to have a
mixed UNIX/NT environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x134fc38"></a>Upending Traditional Linux Development
Models</h2></div></div><p>With Linux, most of the current software development is
driven from the bottom: what happens in the kernel drives what
happens with applications. Side Effects thinks, for the high-end
graphics market at least, this needs to be a bit different. Houdini
is an application, with low-level needs that aren't quite available
the way Side Effects wants them. Salvini said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What will happen is the missing pieces underneath
will just naturally fill in&mdash;development is being driven from the
top of the software chain. This is an exciting change in the way
development happens for Linux.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x134fdf0"></a>Motivations</h2></div></div><p>Side Effects wanted to do their part to move things forward
by providing the application. By providing a Linux solution, they
felt they could provide their customers with the best of both
worlds, low-cost Intel-based platforms and the familiar UNIX
environment. Plus, having the kernel source offers the effects
houses, which tend to have very technical needs, the opportunity to
make modifications they might not otherwise be able to
perform.</p><p><a href="3522f4.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot 2.</a></p><p>Part of the reason they considered doing the port was the
interest shown by a number of effects houses for a Linux-based
Houdini. The interest was &ldquo;provisional&rdquo;, considering the lack of
workstation-class hardware support (i.e., the OpenGL hardware
acceleration), but Side Effects took these requests to heart and
felt they could help move the process along by providing the
application side of the equation.</p><p>Although they didn't have any actual customers signed up for
the port&mdash;just customers showing interest in its possibility&mdash;and
even though no satisfactory 3-D hardware acceleration was
available, Side Effects felt they had to move forward with the
project. Mr. Salvini told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We did this as much because we felt it was the
right thing to do as anything else. To sit around complaining that
no one has developed proper hardware acceleration is kind of
hypocritical if you're not providing the application that will take
advantage of it. You've got to put your money where your mouth is
and do the work.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x1350108"></a>The Port</h2></div></div><p>Before starting work, Salvini said Side Effects spoke to
Darryl Strauss at Digital Domain, Xi Graphics and Metro Link about
the hardware support that might be forthcoming from the X server
vendors. Initially, they started with XFree86, then moved to Xi's
AcceleratedX to make use of support for overlay planes, something
neither XFree86 nor Metro Link supported at the time. The overlay
planes allowed them to speed displays by not having to continually
redraw sections of the screen. The dependency on Xi's server is
temporary, however, since both the other vendors are working on
overlay planes, plus Houdini doesn't have a huge need for them. In
fact, Side Effects may provide Houdini in a version that works
without overlay planes. The drawback will be a hit in performance,
but the program will still be fully compatible with the version
supporting overlay planes.</p><p>Salvini couldn't talk about which 3-D cards they were looking
at, due to non-disclosure agreements. He did say that on the NT
port they had worked with IBM and Intergraph, 3-D Labs, Diamond
Multimedia and Accel Graphics. Intergraph provides their Intense3D,
also known as the Wildcat 4000 card, for the IBM Intellistation. He
said response from all these vendors was very good for that port.
Since all of these card manufacturers have shown varying interest
in the Linux environment, one can only imagine what, if any, their
involvement with upcoming hardware announcements for Linux might
be.</p><p>Beyond hardware acceleration, other issues which the porting
team had to deal with are easily recognizable to anyone who has
done UNIX-to-UNIX porting in the past: sockets, shared memory work,
clone vs. fork/vfork. These are the typical issues encountered when
porting applications from IRIX to another UNIX platform (or vice
versa). Linux, for all practical purposes, fits into the UNIX
marketplace quite well in this respect.</p><p>As for doing the actual work, Side Effects was able to make
use of all the tools they already had. Salvini told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The good thing about Linux was that the tools we
did need&mdash;for debugging and memory checking, for example&mdash;were
available for free and we already had a good idea what was going on
there.</p></blockquote></div><p>Even so, it apparently took quite a while to get all the
graphics pieces working together, since they &ldquo;were always
downloading the latest bit of this or that.&rdquo;
</p><p>Salvini wouldn't term it &ldquo;an easy port&rdquo; from the SGI
version, due to some tricky things they do concerning performance
issues, but he did say it took two engineers about five weeks to do
the work: &ldquo;less time than moving to NT, but it was still longer
than we had hoped.&rdquo;</p><p>The port was actually done as a fun thing at first, and
they'd figured it might be something they could finish in a
weekend. We both laughed when I pointed out that, even with Linux,
such a thing as a &ldquo;weekend port&rdquo; was still a bit of a Holy Grail
for most packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x13504d0"></a>Ready to Rumble</h2></div></div><p>At this point the main graphics work has been completed, but
audio and MIDI support has not been done. MIDI is a fairly small
portion of the product, but they'd still like to finish it sometime
soon. Unfortunately, UNIX audio interfaces are fairly non-standard.
The developers are looking at the Open Sound System as a possible
way to standardize audio ports, but no decision in that arena has
yet been made.</p><p>The Linux port is actually ready to deliver, minus the small
audio issues, but they're waiting on a proper license manager.
Houdini will go to beta when that tool is ready. Due to the
bleeding-edge nature of this project, they don't feel they can use
any of the available license managers, so they may go with one
built in-house.</p><p>The lack of hardware acceleration on the Linux box means it
does not compare to the IRIX boxes for performance. In terms of
everything else&mdash;rendering, simple shading, wire frame
preview&mdash;Linux stacks up fairly well. Salvini said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's surprisingly good without that one piece. I
can't wait for that final chapter to close, for then it will be an
amazing platform.</p></blockquote></div><p>Houdini pushes OpenGL pretty heavily, and as Paul pointed
out:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We'll be a pretty good test of OpenGL for vendors
on Linux.</p></blockquote></div>

Although used primarily for film, Houdini is also used by a few
game companies in Japan. That is one region Side Effects is pushing
for better Linux support. They are also involved in some scientific
visualization and even a bit of industrial design, both areas that
currently are seriously under-represented in the Linux marketplace.
</p><p>Many special effects shops use multiple packages for their
work, one for modeling, another for animation, another for effects
and another for compositing. Ultimately, you'd want to see all of
those tools for Linux. The toughest one will be something like 3D
Studio Max, because it has been designed specifically for the
Windows platform, unlike many other tools that have their roots in
the UNIX world. However, tools like 3D Studio Max are important for
the graphic arts world on Linux because they're mid-range tools,
where many people get their start. SoftImage and Alias/Wavefront
will be easier ports, because they are used to the UNIX and X
environment. SoftImage is owned by Avid, but neither the SoftImage
nor the Alias products have been talked about lately for the Linux
platform.</p><p>Many hardware vendors are aware of Side Effects' port, but
Paul is under non-disclosure with those vendors and couldn't talk
about their plans. Most of the software vendors who have talked to
Side Effects have asked them about the port&mdash;they want to know what
Side Effects knows that they don't. Most of this has to do with
questions relating to hardware acceleration. That's the key for
which many application vendors are waiting. Like the public, those
other vendors will have to wait until the workstation, graphics
card and X server vendors start to make their own
announcements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x13508f0"></a>Side Effects Take On Open Source</h2></div></div><p>The developers and management at Side Effects have talked
about open source quite a bit, says Salvini:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There was a great article on it by someone at
Netscape about the business case for Open Source and how you might
make money with that.</p></blockquote></div><p>They had never had Open Source, but this got them tossing the
idea around a bit, albeit without releasing all the bits and pieces
of Houdini. The concept raised a lot of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions, but
so far it hasn't gotten much past that point. They are obviously
intrigued with the idea, however.
</p><p>Side Effects does offer source access in a traditional sense
with a developer's kit allowing access to header files and
libraries, but the core remains proprietary, partly due to their
concerns about maintaining product consistency. They do believe
they offer extensibility with the plug-in interface. Salvini says
that with high-level applications like Houdini, access to the core
code is not as vital as access to the operating system
source.</p><p>Paul doesn't think anyone at Side Effects actually uses Linux
at home, although there may be one guy who has it. In fact, he says
most of their developers don't even have systems at home.
Apparently, they have lives when they leave work. I had to wonder a
bit what that might be like.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1257580.0x1350bb0"></a>Now that the Penguin is Out of the Hat</h2></div></div><p>Although the Houdini port to Linux is big news for graphics
nuts like me, don't expect to run out and pick up a copy of Houdini
off the shelf at CompUSA. A single-seat license for Houdini runs
about $17,000 US, with the developer's kit running an additional
$4000 US. This is very high-end software for professional
organizations.</p><p>Considering this high price, I asked Paul about his take on a
more affordable modeling package that has developed a big
following&mdash;Blender. He replied:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>You can't compare the two. They really aren't in
the same class of product. I didn't play with [Blender] long enough
to do it justice, but obviously its price point is such that people
will be able to take advantage of it just from a personal
development level, i.e., an experiment in playing with graphics
tools. You don't do that with a $17,000 product.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Blender, Houdini is a product that needs a bit of
serious commitment from the user in order to warrant its expense.
</p><p>However, the news of the Houdini port is important more for
what it represents, the credibility it gives to Linux in the
desktop graphics marketplace, than the product being produced.
Salvini was right when he told me,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This article won't be about trying to sell
Houdini to the readers&mdash;it's not priced for the average user&mdash;it's
about how Linux is developing in the high-end, graphics workstation
market. Side Effects has been pushing the hardware vendors in this
direction quite a bit and I feel we'll be seeing some great success
in the next year, to bring Linux into the graphics workstation
market, which it really hasn't been to date.</p></blockquote></div><p>He's right. Now that Houdini has made the jump, things truly
are about to change.
