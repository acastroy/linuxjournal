surrounding the Mindcraft/Microsoft challenge has died down. I know
many folks were up in arms at first about the results, and I'll
offer a few of my own observations. First, I'd like to note that
few sites run anything like the systems used in the benchmark,
i.e., any operating system on quad-Pentium 1GB+ RAM machines. Most
of my sites run on anything from 486-33s with 16MB RAM to single
Pentium 450s with up to 256MB RAM, so I rarely see a dual processor
machine. Second, I'd like to thank MS for providing the kernel
hackers the opportunity to use these systems so they could identify
bottlenecks that show up only on this type of system. Finally, I
don't have a watch that measures time in nanoseconds or
milliseconds or even tenths of a second. Even if a file comes three
seconds later from a Linux server than from an NT server (NetBEUI
is their native protocol after all, so they should be better at
it), at least I know I'll get it. With NT, I'm never sure until
after it arrives&mdash;if it does. I hope none of our gentle readers are
numbered among those who flamed Mindcraft. I promise no benchmark
software is included with this month's selections.

to find out how much disk space you are using, but it can be quite
verbose. It often dumps out more information than anyone could use,
and in no particular order. <span   class="bold"><b>durep</b></span>
will show you the files on your disk, and by default, sort the
information according to file size from largest to smallest. As a
bonus, it displays this data graphically and can also create web
pages. It requires Perl.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dog:</b></span><a href="http://www.nl.linux.org/~wsl/dog.html" target="_self">www.nl.linux.org/~wsl/dog.html</a></p><p>Well, you knew it had to happen&mdash;someone who doesn't like
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> brings you
<span   class="bold"><b>dog</b></span>. Being the skeptic that I am,
I had to check this one out. Since cat has been around a long time,
it must be sufficient for most uses&mdash;it has enough options, anyway.
However, dog does add a few new options, such as
<b  >-l</b> which allows you to choose specific lines by
line number, and <b  >-rot=</b> which allows you to
rotate letters using any number you choose, not just 13. You can
also display the file with a $ character to mark each newline in
the file. It requires glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tkfileman:</b></span><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~joeja/programs.html" target="_self">www.mindspring.com/~joeja/programs.html</a></p><p>Sometimes it's the simple things in life that make it
worthwhile. This is a simple thing as well. Its author says he's
stopped development on it, but I see little I would change. The one
nice thing about Tcl/Tk is that it's not fussy about the GUI
underneath it. This little file manager will gzip, bzip2, gunzip,
bunzip2, as well as tar and untar. And copy, move, rename, etc.,
are also included. What more could you need in a file manager?
Well, how about gnorpm? I would have chosen xrpm, and that feature
can probably be changed easily. This is just one of several nice
packages the author has lying about on his web site (including a
much improved version of the tknotepad highlighted in this column a
few issues back). Requires Tcl/Tk (tested against v8.0.4) and a
GUI. It will also require the actual files for those commands you
wish to run (tar, gzip, bzip2, mv, gnorpm, etc.) in your
$PATH.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>geneweb:</b></span><a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/GeneWeb" target="_self">http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/GeneWeb/</a></p><p>When I was a child, I heard the statement &ldquo;Every family's
got a skeleton in the closet&rdquo;. My family has plenty of skeletons
which aren't even that discreet. Since I've started using this
program, more keep appearing. If you are interested in genealogy,
this web program is for you. Completely self-contained, it allows
you to use either geneweb's built-in web server or your own web
server and geneweb's CGI script. The author is French, and geneweb
has support for thirteen languages easily chosen from the start
page. Handy, when half your family speaks only English and the
other half only Spanish. It requires ncurses, libm, glibc, ocaml
and camlp.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>portsentry:</b></span><a href="http://www.psionic.com/abacus/portsentry" target="_self">http://www.psionic.com/abacus/portsentry/</a></p><p>This particular piece of software is a very nice complement
to your firewall (packet filter or proxy) software. The use of
programs such as <span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> with stealth
mode by script kiddies and slow port scans, etc. make detection of
probes difficult to spot. Older packages, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>courtney</b></span>, aren't up to the task.
<span   class="bold"><b>portsentry</b></span> doesn't just report
scans&mdash;it logs them and reacts to them. If someone is probing ports
where you aren't offering services, it will react to those
addresses and drop their packets. The author has developed a
well-thought-out program and extensive documentation. This one is a
must for the security-minded. It requires glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DownLoader for
X:</b></span><a href="http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo" target="_self">http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo/</a></p><p>If you know what files you want, this is a very handy tool.
It won't show you what's available, but if you point it at a
directory, http or ftp address, it will attempt to download the
files at that location. Complete with timeouts and retries,
DownLoader attempts to optimize downloading large numbers of files.
It would be nice to have a listing option and perhaps be able to
choose particular files. Its difficulty of use is mitigated by its
ability to snarf both ftp and http. It requires libpthread, libgtk,
libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libstdc++,
libm and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gtkpool:</b></span><a href="http://members.xoom.com/jacquesft" target="_self">http://members.xoom.com/jacquesft/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gtkpool</b></span> is a pool game for
the X Window system that allows you to play a game of billiards for
relaxation. What it has been able to confirm for me is that my eye
is as crooked as I have always thought&mdash;my bad shots are not really
imperfections in the pool table (my favorite excuse). If you enjoy
playing pool, this game will keep you amused when the pool hall is
closed. It requires libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p></div></div>
