    &ldquo;The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.&rdquo; --Richard
    Hamming, 1915-1998
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24ea298"></a></h2></div></div><p>In today's visual world of data
processing, many people think solving problems with computers means
implementing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). From this point of
view, writing real-time applications means writing GUIs while at
the same time mastering the system-dependent functions that ensure
predictable response times, often in conjunction with arcane
hardware features. This mixture of system-dependent GUIs and
hardware-dependent real-time functions usually leads to complex,
expensive and non-portable applications. To attack the general
problem of writing portable real-time applications, I will first
look back at the roots of the UNIX operating system. Then, I will
apply the lessons learned to a simple multimedia application that
runs on three very different platforms: Linux, IRIX and Win32 (MS
Windows 95/98/NT/2000).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24ea3a0"></a>Good Vibrations</h2></div></div><p>Most people know how a sine or a square wave sounds. They can
be heard as a beep or a test signal from a PC speaker, a telephone
or a common musical instrument such as a flute. The portable
application we will implement produces such sounds. Sine, triangle
and square waves are just special cases of a more general wave
produced by the Duffing oscillator (see Resources). Depending on
the parameters, which can be adjusted by two sliders in the GUI,
this oscillator is also able to emit chaotic sounds. (Chaotic, in
this sense, gets its meaning from nonlinear dynamics or chaos
theory.) When starting the application, you will actually be able
to put some research results to the test by listening to the sound
and by watching the graphical behaviour of the Duffing oscillator.
Nonetheless, such an application has to produce sound continuously,
otherwise the sound will be distorted by clicks or even silence.
Thus, this application is an example of a real-time
application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24ea4a8"></a>The UNIX Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>Before starting our implementation, we must think about the
design of such a portable application, forgetting for the moment
that we want to implement our multimedia application with a GUI.
Most UNIX programmers know what is meant by the <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX
philosophy</em></span>. In the good old days, when all user
interfaces were textual, not graphical, Kernighan and Pike
explained this notion in the epilogue of their book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Unix Programming Environment</em></span>. They emphasized the
importance of breaking a problem into separate sub-problems with a
simple interface between them, usually a pipe. Putting a pipe
between the processes means having the textual output of one
process read as textual input by the next process. Each sub-problem
was then implemented and tested stepwise on its own, preferably by
applying existing tools.</p><p>This design philosophy allows for writing portable
applications and is a sharp contrast to today's development
environments. Today, many programmers use some visual development
environment to build monolithic applications bound to one
platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24ea6b8"></a>The Pipeline</h2></div></div><p>The crucial question is: can a GUI-based real-time
application be implemented as an old-fashioned UNIX pipeline? It
can&mdash;you just have to choose the right tools. A GUI-based
application which allows for adjustment of parameters, emission of
sound and visualization of results can be broken down into a
pipeline of processes: GUI--&gt;Sound Generation--&gt;Sound
Output--&gt;Graph.</p><p>Stage 1 (GUI) provides a way to interactively adjust the
parameters of a mathematical model. These parameters may be
adjusted with knobs, slide bars or with a point in a
two-dimensional plane, whichever is most intuitive. It can easily
be replaced without affecting other stages, provided it produces
the same kind of data on its standard output.</p><p>Stage 2 (generation) is invisible to the user, so it does not
need a GUI. It takes the parameters from stage 1 and processes them
using a mathematical model of a physical process. The only
challenge at this stage is doing both parameter input and
continuous computation at the same time, but at different
unsynchronized rates.</p><p>Stage 3 (sound emission) reads the resulting waveform and
hands it over to the sound system. Because of significant
differences in the implementation of sound systems on platforms
like Linux, IRIX and Win32, we need to have some experience with
encapsulating platform-dependent code. Fortunately, this is the
only stage written for a particular platform.</p><p>Stage 4 (graphical output), just like stage 1, has contact
with the user and will therefore be implemented as a GUI. Just like
stage 1, the results can be represented in many different ways
without affecting other stages. Examples are tables, simple
amplitude diagrams, trajectories in phase space or Poincar&eacute;
sections.</p><p>Each stage can also be used on its own or as a building block
in a completely different application. Stage 3 is the most
interesting building block.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24ea978"></a>Choice of Tools</h2></div></div><p>It is clear that transferring large amounts of data from
stage 2 to stage 3 is the bottleneck of the system. Writing into
the pipe, reading again and scanning each sample absorbs more CPU
time than every other operation. So, stages 2 and 3 must be
integrated into one program, because passing of data (44,100 values
per second) takes too much time. You might think integrating these
stages into one is a design flaw&mdash;it is not. I could have easily
renumbered stages and changed this article, but I preferred to show
you how cruel life in real time is to ingenuous software
designers.</p><p>For Stage 1, Tcl/Tk is a natural choice as a tool for
implementation of the first sub-problem. Many people have forgotten
that the GUI process in Tcl/Tk also has a textual standard output
which can be piped into the second process.</p><p>In Stages 2 and 3, the sound generator reads the textual
parameters from the GUI-process and computes the proper sound
signal from it in real time. Therefore, it should be written in C,
because it is the most critical sub-problem as far as real-time
constraints are concerned. As a side effect of sound generation,
the data needed for graphing the results will be written to
standard output and piped into the final stage of the
application.</p><p>Since Stage 4 outputs graphs of the results, it is also a
task well-suited for a tool like Tcl/Tk.</p><p>The user will notice only stages 1 and 4 of the pipeline,
because he can see each of them as a window and interact with them.
It is an interesting paradox that the seemingly important stages 1
and 4 are rather trivial to implement, given a tool like Tcl/Tk.
Stages 2 and 3, although mostly unnoticed, are the most challenging
sub-problems because of synchronization concepts in real time
(<span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> or thread), real-time
constraints due to continuous sound emission and the different
handling of sound systems and all platform dependencies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24eac38"></a>Concurrency of Development</h2></div></div><p>We have already mentioned that one advantage of this pipeline
approach is splitting the development into largely independent
sub-tasks, which allows one programmer to work on each task
concurrently. Equally important is the fact that each stage could
also be implemented in different ways by different programmers. To
demonstrate this, we will look at three solutions to the stage 1
task:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Textual user interface on the command line</p></li><li><p>GUI with Tcl/Tk (Listings 1 and 2)</p></li><li><p>GUI with a Netscape browser and GNU AWK 3.1 as a
server (Listing 3, which is not printed but is included in the
archive file)</p></li></ul></div><p>Also, we will look at three different implementations of
stage 4:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Textual output into a file</p></li><li><p>Graphical output of this data with GNUPLOT (Figure
5)</p></li><li><p>Graphical output with Tcl/Tk (Listing 5)</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24eb268"></a>How Will It Sound?</h2></div></div><p>Now that the design of the system is clear, it is time to
become more precise about the type of sound we want to produce.
Imagine a driven steel beam held pinned to fixed supports at the
bottom and top. When driving the beam from the side, the fixed
supports induce a membrane tension at finite deflections. This
leads to a hardening nonlinear stiffness for moderately large
deflections by a cubic term. At the beginning of this century, the
engineer Georg Duffing from Berlin, Germany was annoyed by this
kind of noise which came from vibrating machine parts. Such noise
is not only a nuisance, it also shortens the expected lifetime of
machine parts. Duffing found a simple nonlinear differential
equation which describes the behaviour of machine parts under
certain circumstances:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
x'' + kx' + x3 = Bcos(t)
</pre><p>This oscillator is driven by a sinusoidal force on the right
of the equation (with magnitude <span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>) and damped
by the parameter <span   class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> on the left side of the
equation. So, there are only two free parameters in this driven
oscillator.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3577f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Changing parameters <span  class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> (damping) and
<span  class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> (forcing) will move the oscillator in or out
of a chaotic regime (see page 11, Thompson/Stewart).
</p></div></div>

</p><p>In Figure 3, you can see a short wave form originating from
such a sound machine. Unlike Duffing, you can simulate the noise
production with your computer by varying the parameters with a GUI
such as the one shown in Figures 1 and 2. You should expect that
varying parameter <span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> on the right axis of
figure 1 influences just the volume of the noise. In fact, by
pushing <span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> to its minimal position 0, you can
actually switch off the noise. When pushing parameter
<span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> to its maximum, noise will not only become
louder, it will also change the main frequency but not in a
continuous and monotonic way. This strange behaviour of changing
frequency along with loudness does not occur in linear oscillators.
In 1980, Ueda published a systematic look at the points in the
plane opened up by the parameters <span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> in Figure 1. By computer simulation, he
found areas where the oscillator emits chaotic sounds. These
results are summarized in Thompson and Stewart's book (see
Resources).</p><p>Why is it so hard to compute these wave forms? After all, a
formula to be evaluated for each time instant should be all that is
needed; however, there is no such analytical function. When in
trouble, engineers often fall back on simple approximations. We
will do so with a technique called Finite Differencing (see
Resources) which gives us a one-line calculation at each time
instant (Listing 4).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x24eb9a0"></a>The Implementation</h2></div></div><p><a href="3577l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>With Tcl/Tk, it is so simple to implement stage 1 that we can
afford to look at two different implementations. When executing the
script in Listing 2 with the <b  >wish -f duffing.tcl</b>
command, the two independent parameters <span   class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> are visualized as the axes of a
two-dimensional coordinate system. Drag the circle to any place on
the map, and the new coordinates will be printed to standard
output. But maybe you prefer the simpler implementation shown in
Listing 1, which displays both parameters as scales. If you run a
computer without a GUI, you can still work with the software
presented here. In this case, forget about stage 1; stage 2 will
read its input from the command line. Enter lines like <b  >k
0.05</b> or <b  >B 7.5</b> at run time, and stage 2
will not notice the difference.</p><p><a href="3577l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>Stages 2 and 3 had to be integrated into one program for
reasons of efficiency. It was tempting to implement each stage as a
single thread of execution. Threads of execution behave mostly like
processes that share a single data space: one waiting for input to
modify parameters, the other one calculating the wave form to be
emitted. How does one implement threads of execution in a portable
way? The POSIX thread library (see Resources) is now available for
most operating systems, including the ones mentioned earlier. For
example, at STN Atlas Elektronik we use threads for sound
generation with multiple sound cards in a multiprocessor setting
(two CPUs and Linux 2.2 SMP). As explained in David Butenhof's
excellent book, threads make it very hard to debug software;
therefore, we will refrain from using them here.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3577f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This user interface allows for precise tuning of
parameters. Notice that you can actually hear chaotic regimes; they
sound markedly &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and not as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; as other regions.
</p></div></div><p><a href="3577l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Stage 2 and 3 in C, integrator.c</a></p><p>Fortunately, the problem of dealing with unsynchronized
events can be solved with the often underestimated select system
call (Listing 4, function <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span>).
The main loop of Listing 4 has a short loop to check whether there
is data coming in from standard input. Then, it calculates a block
of data by Finite Differencing and finally emits it. While
calculating, some data points are printed to standard output. Only
those which occur at integral multiples of the cycle period of the
driving force, having the same phase angle, are printed. This
technique of selecting data points to display is at the heart of
the Poincar&eacute; section, a kind of stroboscope which reveals
hidden order within chaotic data (Figure 5). Notice that this data
is the input to stage 4.</p><p>Figure 3. The default parameters show sensitive dependence on
initial conditions (see page 4, Thompson/Stewart).</p><p><a href="3577f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p>This was the easy part; the hard part is handing over the
data to the sound system in a portable way. In this respect, Linux
is the platform handled most easily. Writing data to the special
file /dev/dsp is enough. With IRIX, we also need just one function
call; not the usual <span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>, but a
special sound function. In both cases, synchronization is
implemented by the blocking behaviour of these functions. This is
in contrast to Win32, which bothers the programmer with buffer
handling, and synchronization must be done with callback functions.
Using the new DirectSound API was not an option because Microsoft
has failed to implement the DirectX API in Windows NT.</p><p><a href="3577s2.html" target="_self">How to Compile and Run Listing

Figure 5). Each data point read is printed as a dot in the phase
space diagram. When producing Poincar&eacute; section data as in
stage 3, linear oscillators produce circles or spirals,
degenerating into fixed points, which is rather boring. A chaotic
oscillator is needed to plot the strange attractor shown in Figure
5.</p><p>Figure 4. High resolution Poincar&eacute; section of one
chaotic attractor</p><p><a href="3577f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23f2580.0x28e47f8"></a>Portability Considerations</h2></div></div><p>In the sidebar &ldquo;How to Compile and Run Listing 4&rdquo;, you can
see how to compile the stage 3 program on different platforms and
how to start the whole application as a UNIX pipe. You might be
surprised to find that the compiler
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> can be used even with the
Win32 operating systems. How is this possible? The gcc for Win32 is
part of a UNIX-compatible environment called the Cygwin Toolset
(see Resources). It allows you to work with gcc and its friends on
any Win32 operating system just as if it were a well-behaved UNIX
system. Many GNU packages run out of the box with it. If you want
to use the multimedia functions of Win32 (along with DirectX
access) or the POSIX thread library, you must get and install them
separately (see Resources). Since I started working on Win32, it
became more and more important to adhere to the POSIX system calls,
written down in the XPG4 set of standards. Doing so has become a
rewarding habit, because it is the cornerstone of portability in
the UNIX world.</p><p>What pleased me most was the possibility of installing gcc
from the Cygwin Toolset as a cross compiler on my Linux 2.2 system.
Now I can write and debug my software with Linux, no matter where
it is supposed to run later. In the end, I compile it with the
cross compiler and get a debugged Win32 executable. What an
achievement! If you also would enjoy working this way, follow Mumit
Khan's recipe for cooking a cross compiler (see Resources).</p><p><a href="3577s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
