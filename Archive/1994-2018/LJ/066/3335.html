    Complete instructions for storing your data on CD.

writer (CD-R). They are great pieces of hardware, and prices are
going down all the time. CDs are great for keeping static data.
Your favorite downloads contained on piles of floppies can now be
transferred to one CD, lowering your risk of losing the data. With
your own CD writer, you can make custom CDs of your favorite Linux
distribution, crafted for your needs. You can also make CD archives
of your favorite FTP site and pass it along to friends to avoid
bandwidth problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6a3f8"></a>Choosing and Setting Up Your CD Writer</h2></div></div><p>If you are currently looking for a CD-R, get SCSI. SCSI CD-Rs
have been around far longer than ATAPI (IDE) CD-Rs and, as a
result, are better supported. However, if you do have an ATAPI CD-R
or just can't afford SCSI, don't worry&mdash;you can still make
CDs.</p><p>In order to write with a SCSI CD-R, you must have &ldquo;SCSI
support&rdquo;, &ldquo;SCSI CD-ROM support&rdquo; and &ldquo;SCSI generic support&rdquo;
compiled in the kernel. Also be sure you have &ldquo;ISO9660 cdrom
filesystem&rdquo; support. Having &ldquo;Loopback device support&rdquo; compiled
in the kernel is a good idea, but not required. For this article, I
will assume you know how to build your own kernel; if not, refer to
the Kernel-HOWTO (see Resources).</p><p>ATAPI CD-Rs require a bit more effort. You must have at least
kernel version 2.0.35; anything below this requires patches.
Recompile your kernel with &ldquo;IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM support&rdquo; disabled
and &ldquo;SCSI Emulation support&rdquo; enabled. Along with these options,
you must also enable those options mentioned above (yes, even the
SCSI support). The result is your CD-R will look and act like a
SCSI device, even though it is an ATAPI. Your CD-writing software
also needs to support ATAPI writing; I will discuss this later.
Note that when you use SCSI emulation, all IDE CD-ROMs change to a
SCSI prefix, so your first CD-ROM would be /dev/scd0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6a5b0"></a>Required Tools</h2></div></div><p>CD writing in Linux requires two utilities:
<span   class="bold"><b>mkisofs</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cdrecord</b></span>. The first, mkisofs, is
required to make an image of the files you wish to burn. Most major
distributions come with this utility, but in any case, getting the
latest version would be wise. The latest version can be found at
<a href="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/mkisofs" target="_self">ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/mkisofs/</a>.
The second utility, cdrecord, is the software used to burn the
image made with mkisofs to a blank CD. You can find cdrecord at
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management</a>,
and again, I highly recommend getting the latest version (1.6.1 at
the time of this writing). Another utility for burning CDs is
<span   class="bold"><b>cdwrite</b></span> which can also be found at
that URL.</p><p>Aside from these, some free and commercial GUI programs for
making CDs are also available. X-CD-Roast (see &ldquo;X-CD-Roast: CD
Writer Software&rdquo; by Thomas Niederreiter, <i  >LJ</i>,
January 1998) is probably the most famous and is freely available;
however, it is based upon the cdwrite utility. There are also X
applications which act as a shell and call upon the appropriate
utilities to do the job.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6a920"></a>Collecting the Files</h2></div></div><p>Once you have the appropriate utilities installed, you can
begin to write your own CDs. Before you begin, collect the files to
be burned under one directory. I'm going to use the downloading and
burning of a Linux distribution as an example throughout this
article. First, let's say you anonymously log in to
ftp.<span   class="emphasis"><em>some_server</em></span>.com and switch to the
directory /pub/linux. This hypothetical directory contains three
different distributions; the list output
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> looks like Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3335l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Directory Listing</a></p><p>Assuming distribution_b is the one you want, proceed to
download the entire distribution by typing <b  >get
distribution_b.tar</b> at the ftp prompt. Of course, this
directory contains everything you need and nothing else. After all,
you wouldn't want to download the distribution for several
different architectures. Thus, when you download an entire
distribution, make sure you go deep enough into the directory to
get only what you need. For example, if you wanted to download the
entire Red Hat distribution for the i386 architecture on
ftp.cdrom.com, you would download everything in the
/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-6.0/i386 directory and below.</p><p>Once the download is finished, create a directory for storing
the files. In this example, I'll create a directory called cdimage,
then place the contents of distribution_b.tar into that directory
by executing the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir cdimage
tar vxf distribution_b.tar -C cdimage
</pre><p>Since the verbose (<b  >v</b>) option is requested,
the contents of distribution_b.tar will fly by on your screen and
its contents will be located in cdimage. If everything went well,
you can now delete distribution_b.tar to save space.
</p><p>If you want to burn some collection of files other than a
Linux distribution, just place them in the cdimage
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6adf0"></a>Creating the CD Image</h2></div></div><p>Remember when creating CDs, the root of the CD is relative to
the created directory; in this case, cdimage. Once you have your
files in this directory, you are ready to create the iso9660 image
using the mkisofs command. To create the basic image, use the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkisofs -r -o cdimage.iso cdimage
</pre><p>The <b  >-r</b> option ensures the image contains
additional file description data by way of the Rock Ridge protocol,
preserving the original file name and setting permissions optimally
for CD-ROMs such that read/execute permissions become global, write
permissions are cleared, and special mode bits are also cleared
since they do not apply on CD-ROMs. The <b  >-o</b>
option designates the output file (cdimage.iso). The last value is
the directory in which the files are located.
</p><p>Many commercially manufactured Linux CDs, such as Red Hat,
are bootable. This isn't difficult to do using the &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo;
standard. Most newer BIOSes today support the bootable CD feature,
and most bootable CDs for the PC are based on El Torito. El Torito
makes your CD appear as a floppy, and thus your BIOS can boot
it.</p><p>If you want a bootable CD, you'll need a 1.44MB boot image
intended for a boot floppy. In our distribution example, we could
use the boot image used for installation. For distribution_b, the
name of the boot image is boot.img. The process by which we make a
CD bootable takes place in the creation of the iso9660 image
(International Organization for Standardization specification for
compact disk read-only memory). Thus, before we create our image,
we need to create a directory inside of cdimage to hold the boot
image; a directory called boot would work fine. So, we place the
image boot.img into cdimage/boot and create the iso9660 image by
executing the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkisofs -r -b boot/boot.img -c boot/boot.cat -o\
   cdimage.iso cdimage
</pre><p>Here we have two new options, both of which are used to make
the CD bootable. The <b  >-b</b> option is followed by
the name of the boot image to be booted. Note that the file is
relative to the root of the CD. The <b  >-c</b> option is
followed by the name of the boot catalog required by El Torito;
this file is automatically created by mkisofs. Only the more recent
versions of mkisofs allow for the automatic creation of the boot
catalog; older versions require you to create it yourself.
</p><p>Before actually burning the CD, take a look at your image
layout by mounting it. This is done using a loopback device, so
this must be supported in the kernel. The following command will
mount your image:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -r -t iso9660 -o loop cdimage.iso /mnt
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6b318"></a>Burning the CD</h2></div></div><p>Once you've created your image, bootable or not, you are
ready for the final process of burning it onto the CD using either
cdrecord or cdwrite. Take the following into consideration before
you start:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make sure the computer isn't experiencing any
excessive vibrations.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the image is on a local hard
drive.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the load on your system isn't too
high.</p></li></ul></div><p>Keeping these three things in mind will help prevent errors
during the write process. The CD writer can be put through a test
process that won't actually write, but will simulate the entire
process. This is done by adding the <b  >-dummy</b>
option for cdrecord and the <b  >-y</b> option for
cdwrite. Now all that is left is inserting a blank CD and executing
the command that matches your choice of writer.
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord -eject -v -isosize speed=2 dev=0,0\
   cdimage.iso
cdwrite -ev --device /dev/??? -s 2 cdimage.iso
</pre>


The first two options for both utilities are eject and verbose.
Thus, the CD will eject after the burning process is finished, and
the program will run in verbose mode. The option
<b  >-isosize</b> for cdrecord limits the size of the CD
to the size of the iso9660 image. The options
<b  >speed=2</b> and <b  >-s&nbsp;2</b>
indicate the speed at which to write to the CD; in this case, the
<b  >2</b> means at 2x. Finally, the options
<b  >--device, dev=0,0</b> and
<b  >/dev/???</b> set the target device, where
<b  >/dev/???</b> should be your CD-R (i.e., /dev/scd0)
and <b  >0,0</b> stands for the SCSI ID and bus in that
order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb72580.0xc6baa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If all worked out well, congratulations. You now have a
full-fledged, iso9660 CD. You can make a CD with other formats just
as well. The utility <span   class="bold"><b>mkhybrid</b></span>,
included with mkisofs, can make images of Joliet and HFS format. It
is also possible to make a CD with the EXT2 file system format.
Have fun burning!</p><p><a href="3335s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
