    An introduction to writing and running Java servlets on
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd5580.0xccd348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Java servlets are essentially Java
programs which extend the functionality of a server. They are not
confined to web servers, but are most often referred to in this
context. Virtually all references to servlets cite them as a
replacement for CGI scripts, so it is easiest to think of them as
Java programs that perform CGI functions.
</p><p>The intriguing thing about servlets is their claimed
performance. Traditional CGI scripts written in Perl, C, etc. all
have a disadvantage in that a new process must be created for each
call of the script. The overhead of process creation and management
can be very taxing on a loaded server. Servlets solve this problem
by creating a thread for each request, rather than an entire
process. A single process for each servlet is created, then a
request to the servlet causes a thread to be created to handle
it.</p><p>Sounds great, but how does one use servlets on Linux? Well,
you need a web server that supports both servlets and a Java
virtual machine. There are several choices in the web server
department. Sun's Java Web Server will probably run on Linux (since
it is written in Java), but it is commercial. We'll be using Apache
in this article because it is free and is widely used. This means
we need a servlet extension for Apache. Livesoftware makes a
product called JRun which I have heard great things about, but
again, we'll stick strictly to the Apache side of the world and go
with their mod_jserv extension.</p><p>Next, you'll need to choose a JDK (Java Development Kit) for
your system. Again, there are several choices. Two worth mentioning
are the Blackdown JDK
(<a href="http://java.blackdown.org" target="_self">http://java.blackdown.org/</a>)
and the new OpenGroup JDK
(<a href="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/RI/java/linux" target="_self">http://www.camb.opengroup.org/RI/java/linux/</a>),
which uses a native threads implementation. Since threads are
important to servlet performance, your JDK choice might
significantly impact performance. I used the Blackdown JDK, because
I was familiar with it and knew it was stable. However, the
OpenGroup's work is worth looking into if you have the time.</p><p>To get servlets up and running on your system, follow the
steps below. Note I assume the JDK you chose is installed and
working.</p><p>The first step is to download the latest version of Apache
(<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_self">http://www.apache.org/</a>)
and the latest version of JServ
(<a href="http://java.apache.org" target="_self">http://java.apache.org/</a>).
These were 1.3.1 and 0.9.11 respectively, at the time of
writing.</p><p>The second step is to unpack each of the archives using the
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf apache_1.3.1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf jserv0.9.11.tar.gz
</pre><p>The third step is to compile Apache with the JServ module.
Specify any options you need in the Apache configuration, but make
sure to include an <b  >--add-module</b> switch to
specify where the mod_jserv.c file is located. Here is a simple
example of an Apache configuration command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
                --add-module=/usr/local/src/
                jserv0.9.11/mod_jserv.c
</pre>


This will automatically add the JServ module to your Apache
configuration. Once configuration is finished, go ahead and make
and install the package:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make
make install
</pre>


The fourth step is to compile JServ. Before compiling JServ, you
must pick a location for installation. If you are happy with the
directory where you unpacked it in step two, then you are set.
Otherwise, just move the JServ directory to wherever you want it to
reside. To keep things clean, you might want to put it in your
Apache installation tree.
</p><p>Next, the <b  >CLASSPATH</b> variable needs to be
set. Even though the JServ documentation suggests this may not be
necessary, I found the package didn't compile unless it was
explicitly set. The <b  >CLASSPATH</b> variable must
specify the path to your JDK classes and the JSDK classes included
in the JServ package. My JDK lives in /usr/local/jdk1.1.6 and the
JDK classes archive is in the /lib directory of this tree. I have
JServ in /usr/local/apache/jserv, so my
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> variable would be set as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/jdk1.1.6/lib/\
classes.zip:/usr/local/apache/jserv/servclasses.zip
</pre><p>Once this is set, change to the JServ directory and compile
it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/apache/jserv
make
</pre>


Step five is to configure Apache. JServ requires that a number of
configuration parameters be added to your Apache server
configuration files. The files are typically located in the /etc
directory of your Apache installation tree. Open up httpd.conf with
your favorite editor and add the following configuration
directives:
</p><p><b  >ServletBinary</b>: the full pathname to your
java binary. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ServletBinary /usr/local/jdk1.1.6/bin/java
</pre><p><b  >ServletClassPath</b>: specifies the path to
your various Java classes. JServ requires you to specify the path
to the JDK, JSDK and JServ classes. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ServletClassPath\
/usr/local/jdk1.1.6/lib/classes.zip
#path to the JDK classes
ServletClassPath\
/usr/local/apache/jserv/servclasses.zip
#path to the JSDK classes
ServletClassPath /usr/local/apache/jserv/classes
#path to the JServ classes
</pre>


<b  >ServletAlias</b>: this is one of the most important
directives, since it configures the location of your servlets and
how they are accessed. The syntax of the directive is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ServletAlias <span   class="emphasis"><em>uri</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>directory_or_filename</em></span>
</pre>


where the <b  ><i><tt>uri</tt></i></b>
argument specifies how your servlets will be accessed via URLs, and
the second argument points to the actual location of the servlets.
The second argument can either specify a directory containing the
servlets or a ZIP/JAR file containing a collection of servlets.
</p><p>For example, if your ServletAlias directive was</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ServletAlias /servlets /usr/local/apache/servlets
</pre><p>then URLs addressing your servlets would look like
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourhostname</em></span>/servlets, and the actual
servlets would reside in the /usr/local/apache/servlets directory.
</p><p><b  >ServletProperties</b>: gives the location of a
file containing properties for your servlets. The path can be
absolute or relative to Apache's server root and, if not specified,
defaults to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
conf/servlets.properties
</pre><p>Many properties can be set within the properties file.
Arguments can be passed to all servlets with the statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
servlets.default.initArgs=arg1=<span   class="emphasis"><em>val1</em></span>,arg2=<span   class="emphasis"><em>val2</em></span>,...
</pre>


Arguments can be passed to individual servlets as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
servlet.servletname.initArgs=arg1=<span   class="emphasis"><em>val1</em></span>,arg2=<span   class="emphasis"><em>val2</em></span>,...
</pre>


The sixth and final step is to fire up Apache. Well, you should be
ready to go at this point, so go into the /sbin directory of your
Apache tree and start up the server:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/apache/sbin
./apachectl start
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd5580.0xcce580"></a>Writing Servlets</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>Servlet</b></span> interface
provides the foundation for all servlets. All servlets must either
implement this interface or be extensions of a class which
implements it. The Servlet package provides a class called
<b  >HttpServlet</b> which implements the Servlet
interface, so as a servlet developer, much of the work is done for
you. The Servlet interface allows the creation of generic servlets,
but we will only look at how to create servlets that act as CGI
scripts. For this, all you have to worry about is the
<b  >HttpServlet</b> class.</p><p><a href="3119l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Let's step through the code of the simple servlet shown in
Listing 1 to see how it works. This servlet overrides the
<span   class="bold"><b>doGet</b></span> method provided by the
<b  >HttpServlet</b> class.
<span   class="bold"><b>doGet</b></span> is called when a client
makes a GET request to the servlet. Here we have the servlet
respond with a simple web page that gives the standard &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; message. The doGet method gets two objects,
<b  >HttpServletRequest</b> and
<b  >HttpServletResponse</b>, which encapsulate
information that allows the servlet to obtain information from and
communicate with the client. For example, the
<b  >HttpServletResponse</b> object contains a
<b  >PrintWriter</b> object that can be used to send
information back to the client. In this example, we use it to send
our &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; message back to the client. We also use the
<span   class="bold"><b>setContentType</b></span> method of the
<b  >HttpServletResponse</b> object to inform the client
that it will be receiving text/HTML data from the servlet.</p><p>Now that we've seen a simple example, let's step back a bit
and look at how HTTP Servlets work. Servlets extending the
<b  >HttpServlet</b> class handle all of their client
requests through its <span   class="bold"><b>service</b></span>
method. The service method understands standard HTTP requests, and
calls appropriate methods to handle each request. In the example
above, the service would recognize the GET request and call the
<span   class="bold"><b>doGet</b></span> method accordingly.
Similarly, <span   class="bold"><b>doPost</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>doPut</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>doDelete</b></span> methods are provided to
handle other types of HTTP requests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd5580.0xcc56a8"></a>The Life Cycle of a Servlet</h2></div></div><p>A servlet's life begins when the servlet's
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> method is called. The web
server calls the init method when it loads the servlet, but before
any client requests are handled. The init method is called only
once when the servlet is loaded. So, if you need to perform any
initialization before your servlet starts handling requests,
overload the <b  >init</b> method as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
                super.init(config);

                ...
        }
</pre><p>The init method is passed an object which contains
configuration information about the servlet. It is a good idea to
store this object to make it available if the client needs it. The
easiest way to do this is to call the init method of superclass and
pass the <b  >ServletConfig</b> object to it. One final
tip regarding the initialization of servlets: if your
initialization fails and the servlet can't handle client requests,
throw an <b  >UnavailableException</b>. After
initialization takes place, the servlet is up and the service
method handles client requests.
</p><p>Finally, when the servlet is unloaded from the web server,
its <span   class="bold"><b>destroy</b></span> method is called. The
web server waits until all service methods are finished or a
certain number of seconds have passed (whichever comes first)
before calling the destroy method. In the case of long-running
service methods, it is possible the destroy method will be called
before all service calls have been completed.</p><p>This situation can be handled with a few additional methods
and variables. First, create a variable that keeps track of how
many service methods have been called and provide synchronized
methods for increasing and decreasing the counter, as well as one
to return the value of your service counter.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
   private int numServices = 0;
   protected synchronized void enterService() {
   numServices++;
   }
   protected synchronized void exitService() {
   numServices-;
   }
   protected synchronized int serviceCount() {
   return numServices;
   }
}
</pre><p>Now, that we have these counters, we need to modify the
service method to increment and decrement them accordingly. This is
done by adding a call to the
<span   class="bold"><b>enterService</b></span> method at the top of
the service method, calling the service method of the superclass to
handle the real work and then decrementing the counter by calling
the <span   class="bold"><b>exitService</b></span> method.
<pre     class="programlisting">
protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse
resp)
   throws ServletException, IOException
   {
   enterService();
   try {
   super.service(req, resp);
   } finally {
   exitService();
   }
   }
</pre>


Next, a flag is needed to determine if the servlet is in the
process of shutting down. To accompany this flag, use accessor
methods to set the flag and return its value.
<pre     class="programlisting">
MyServlet continued {
   private Boolean exiting;
   protected setExiting(Boolean flag) {
     exiting = flag;
   }
   protected Boolean isExiting() {
      return exiting;
   }
}
</pre>


Now the destroy method should first check if any services haven't
completed, then loop until all services are finished.
<pre     class="programlisting">
public void destroy() {
   if (serviceCount() &gt; 0) {
      setShuttingDown(true);
   }
   while(serviceCount() &gt; 0) {
      try {
      Thread.sleep(interval);
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      }
   }
}
</pre>


Finally, modify any of your methods that may run for a long time to
check if the servlet is shutting down, and act accordingly.
<pre     class="programlisting">
public void doPost(...) {
  /* You could do something like this or put
   * the check into a loop
   * that takes a long time */
   if(!isExiting) {
   ...
   }
}
</pre>


So there you have it: a quick introduction to getting servlets up
and running on your Linux box and writing some simple ones. If you
want to learn more about writing servlets, books are available
which cover them in depth. I would also recommend looking at the
Java Tutorial, available on Sun's web site; it contains a nice
introduction to servlets I used when I started learning about them.
