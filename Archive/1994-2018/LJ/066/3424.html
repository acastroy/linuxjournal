    The Java 2 SDK is mow available for Linux. Mr. Foxwell tells us
    all about it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f43f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since its introduction four years ago,
Sun's Java technology has appeared on nearly every size and type of
computer system, from IBM's MVS-powered mainframes to 3Com's Palm
organizers.
</p><p>New versions of the Java Development Kit and Java Virtual
Machine are available first on Sun's systems and on Microsoft
Windows, but many months may pass before they appear on other
platforms. Sun's Java Software division produces reference
implementations <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for Solaris and for
Windows, and licenses source code to other system vendors who want
to port the JDK or JVM to their own hardware and operating
systems.</p><p>Some vendors, like IBM, have their ports of new Java versions
ready almost immediately. Unfortunately, users of platforms such as
Apple's Macintosh have had long waits for the latest JDK. Linux
users didn't see JDK 1.1 until mid-1997, although Sun introduced it
in December 1996, and they have been eagerly awaiting Java 2 since
November of last year.</p><p>Sun had no problem figuring out with whom to arrange Java
licensing agreements at the major system vendors, but it did take
them a while to identify a licensee for the widely dispersed Linux
community. They eventually licensed the JDK source code to Steve
Byrne and the Blackdown Java-Linux Porting Team, a group of Linux
developers.</p><p>The Blackdown team recently released a preliminary version of
the Java 2 SDK aft er testing it extensively with the Java
Compatibility Kit, a suite of more than 16,000 tests which verify a
port's conformance to the published Java language and runtime
specifications.</p><p>You can download the Java 2 SDK for Linux from the Blackdown
mirror web sites, found at
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org" target="_self">http://www.blackdown.org/</a>.
Note that Sun recently changed the name of the software from JDK
1.2 to Java 2 SDK, although much of the on-line material still
refers to the earlier name. The compressed SDK is nearly 24MB, so
use a fast network connection if possible. Full documentation for
Java 2 is packaged separately from the SDK. Download it directly
from Sun's web site at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/index.html" target="_self">java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/index.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f47c0"></a>Installation and Testing</h2></div></div><p>Installation consists of uncompressing and extracting the
jdk1.2pre-v2.tar.bz2 file archive into your home directory or other
location. Use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bzip2 -d jdk1.2pre-v2.tar.bz2
tar xvf jdk1.2pre-v2.tar
</pre><p>In order to use the JDK, you must have a Linux distribution
that includes the glibc2 version of the GNU C library. Most
distributions, such as Red Hat 5.2, include this library, which is
also called libc6.
</p><p>After installation, simply set your <b  >PATH</b>
environment variable to include the JDK's bin directory, and you're
ready to go:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH={<span   class="emphasis"><em>JDK</em></span>-<span   class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span>-<span   class="emphasis"><em>directory</em></span>}/jdk1.2/bin:$PATH
</pre><p>To verify your installation, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
java -version
</pre>


The JVM should run and report its version as &ldquo;java version 1.2&rdquo;,
along with additional information about the implementation.
</p><p>The Java 2 SDK includes several tools for development and
testing, including the <span   class="bold"><b>javac</b></span>
compiler, the <span   class="bold"><b>jar</b></span> Java archive
manager that works similarly to the
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> command, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>appletviewer</b></span> program for testing
applets. &ldquo;Applets&rdquo; are Java programs intended to run within a
browser; Java &ldquo;applications&rdquo; are like any other program and don't
need a browser to run. Current versions of Netscape and Internet
Explorer do not directly support Java 2, so you will need to use
appletviewer to test your applets.</p><p>The Java 2 SDK comes with a compiler, but does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> include an interactive development
environment. You can, of course, use
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>emacs</b></span> to create your source files,
then compile and run them from your command line. For example,
create the file HelloLinux.java containing the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public class HelloLinux
   { public static void main(String[] args)
      { System.out.println("Hello, Linux!"); } }
</pre><p>Compile your program with the command <b  >javac
HelloLinux.java</b>. The compiler will produce the file
HelloLinux.class, which you run using the command <b  >java
HelloLinux</b>. If you encounter problems trying to compile
and run Java programs, check your <b  >PATH</b> and
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> environment variables.
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> lists the directories where the JVM
looks for class files. If your own files or the class files
required for a separately installed Java library are not referenced
in <b  >CLASSPATH</b>, the JVM cannot find and run them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f5210"></a>Major New Features of the Java 2 SDK</h2></div></div><p>The Java 2 SDK includes the Java Foundation Classes, also
known as the &ldquo;Swing&rdquo; class library. This library extends Java's
original Abstract Window Toolkit, used for building graphical user
interfaces. The Swing library provides a rich set of components for
GUI development. The jdk1.2/demo/jfc directory contains more than
100 example source files that demonstrate the library's
capabilities, including the
<span   class="bold"><b>SwingSetApplet</b></span> demo, which shows
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the components at work in one big applet.
The SwingSetApplet includes full source code.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3424f1.large.jpg"><img src="3424f1.jpg"></a></div><p> <span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. SwingSetApplet</b></span>
</p><p>Look in the jdk1.2/demo/jfc/Java2D directory, and you'll find
the remarkable <span   class="bold"><b>Java2DemoApplet</b></span>,
which shows off Java's 2-D imaging APIs, used to control image
rendering, fonts, animation and printing.</p><p>One of the most significant changes to the Java platform
concerns security. Earlier versions treated Java applets and
applications differently, allowing applications unrestricted access
to any system resource, while confining remotely loaded applets to
an all-or-nothing &ldquo;Sandbox&rdquo; model. An applet in the old security
model could not access client system resources and could not
connect to any system other than its originating host. This
provided a strong security model for remotely loaded executable
code, but limited an applet's utility.</p><p>Java 2's new security model is based on a configurable policy
file that can define security <span   class="emphasis"><em>domains</em></span> for each
user, group and program component. This file, called the codeBase,
tells the JVM where programs must be loaded in order to execute and
determines who can run the program using digital signatures to
authenticate the program's origin.</p><p>You can find a sample global policy file for all users in the
jdk1.2/jre/lib/security directory. This file may be customized, and
the JVM can be directed to use the policy file for all code
execution permissions. An especially important point to note is
that programs need not be modified in order to control their
execution; the JVM and policy files determine what can run and who
can run it. Take a look at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/security" target="_self">http://java.sun.com/security/</a>
for details and examples of Java 2 security.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f57e8"></a>Java Programming on Linux</h2></div></div><p>If you are looking for professional Java 2 program
development tools for Linux, you are again at the mercy of the tool
developers, who generally release their products for Windows first
and for other platforms later. However, if the development tool is
written in 100% Pure Java, you are in luck. Blackdown's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Java Tools for Linux</em></span> link lists more than a
dozen Java IDEs, including several that have been updated to work
with Java 2. Check out NetBeans at
<a href="http://www.netbeans.com" target="_self">http://www.netbeans.com/</a>
and Together/J at
<a href="http://www.togetherj.com" target="_self">http://www.togetherj.com/</a>
for two excellent programming tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f59f8"></a>Other Java APIs</h2></div></div><p>Sun has licensed source code for additional APIs to the
Blackdown team, including code for Java 3-D, Java Media Framework,
Java Advanced Imaging and Java Sound. Furthermore, Sun is now
making sources available for much of the Java core technologies,
including the new Jini software, under its Community Source
Licensing Model. While not quite the same as the GNU General Public
License, this model should make it easier for future ports of Java
APIs to Linux and other platforms.</p><p>Linux developers are already at work adapting their solutions
to Java 2. For example, Douglas Lau and Trent Jarvi have
implemented the Java Communications API, used for access to serial
and parallel ports. You can download the necessary libraries from
<a href="http://jarvi.ezlink.com/rxtx" target="_self">http://jarvi.ezlink.com/rxtx/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f5bb0"></a>Learning the Java Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>If you are new to Java programming, your background will
determine how quickly you can learn it. Programmers already
experienced with object concepts through C++ or Smalltalk can
usually become proficient in Java after a few weeks of study and
practice. If you are an &ldquo;object challenged&rdquo; C or FORTRAN
programmer, you will need help learning to think and design using
objects; taking a course in object-oriented programming will get
you started. Beginners should study Sun's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java
Tutorial</em></span> or Bruce Eckel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thinking in
Java</em></span>, while experienced object programmers can jump
right in with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Core Java</em></span> by Horstmann and
Cornell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22ec650"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I can't think of a better platform and user community for
Java than Linux. Now that Java 2 is available, with its advanced
GUI features and flexible security model, I anticipate a major wave
of new and interesting Java programs. The Blackdown team deserves
applause for its efforts.</p><p><a href="3424s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
