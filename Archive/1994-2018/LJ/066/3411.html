    A quick look at what to look for in a laptop for Linux and
    how to set it up.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcbf298"></a></h2></div></div><p>A laptop which runs Linux: most Linux
enthusiasts think this is a great idea, but not surprisingly, some
people who don't use Linux wonder why you would want to run a
flavor of UNIX on a laptop. The answer is simple. If Linux is the
operating system you use, the one on which all the applications and
software you employ on a daily basis run, then you want it for your
portable machine as well.
</p><p>This article is intended for those who are considering
getting a laptop on which to run Linux. It is a quick summary of
what you should be thinking about when looking for a laptop for
Linux, and a brief outline of what you need to get Linux configured
and running on a laptop.</p><p>For more information, the reader is directed to the web pages
in the Resources section at the end of this article. They will be
invaluable in researching and later configuring your laptop for
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcbf450"></a>Hardware Considerations</h2></div></div><p>The first thing to ask yourself is, how do you want to use
the laptop? Is it just for fun? Is it for transferring files
between two locations? Is it to be used for word processing,
programming or graphic manipulation? Do you need only a simple
terminal with which to log in to other machines? Just as with a
desktop machine, considerations like these will affect the decision
regarding which kind of laptop you should get.</p><p>Other questions to consider are: Do you want a CD-ROM drive?
Do you want sound, and if so, what quality? Do you want a built-in
modem? A built-in Ethernet adapter or PCMCIA, a PCMCIA modem, or
neither? Do you want to run X? If so, what video mode do you need
(640x480 is the low end, 800x600 is common, and 1024x728 is
approaching the high-end level of the market)? Do you want color,
and if so, what bit depth (8, 16, 32 bits)?</p><p>Finally, you need to make sure the features you require in
the laptop you are considering are supported with Linux. This is
far less problematic than it was in the past. When I first
installed Linux on a laptop (a Twinhead SubNote with only 4MB of
memory), I was taking a gamble that the hardware I needed would be
supported; fortunately, it was.</p><p>These days, laptop hardware is far less proprietary and you
have a much better chance of just buying a laptop and getting it to
work. Buying a used laptop with a PCMCIA slot for an Ethernet card
is probably sufficient if you just want a machine to use as a
terminal without X. If you are planning on doing more with it, you
will need to verify that your hardware is supported by Linux. (See
Resources.)</p><p>Since laptop LCD (liquid crystal display) screens have fixed
pixel video modes, they usually emulate lower video modes by
duplicating the contents of rows and columns at increments of a set
number of rows and columns, respectively. This means that if you
get a laptop with 800x600 resolution and you plan to use it just
for virtual consoles, you will find that when it is emulating the
640x480 standard VGA mode, the characters will be blocky and ugly.
If fidelity is important for virtual consoles (especially if that
is all you plan to use), you will want to get either a laptop with
640x480 or one with a considerably higher video mode (1024x768).
For these, the virtual consoles will look less blocky and will be
easier to read. Some high-end laptops (such as the Sony Vaio
PCG-505FX) have configuration settings that don't do this
&ldquo;zooming&rdquo;, which makes everything easy to read, albeit
smaller.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcbf6b8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, you need a boot disk appropriate to your laptop's
hardware, just like any other Linux installation. Laptops generally
use IDE, so normally you don't have to worry about SCSI support
unless you have special needs (and have a SCSI PCMCIA card).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>CD-ROM</b></span></p><p>Many laptops these days come with CD-ROM drives, making
installation easy. The CD-ROM drives are generally IDE
interface-compatible, so a standard IDE boot disk will usually
suffice. For slightly-incompatible drives, you will need to enter
special parameters into the kernel.</p><p>Some laptops, such as my Sony Vaio PCG-505FX, have CD-ROM
drives available only through PCMCIA interfaces. Surprisingly,
these do work, although you might have to send parameters to the
kernel at boot time. For instance, my Sony drive works fine only if
I send the kernel parameter <b  >ide2=0x180,0x386</b> on
boot. I could also put an <b  >append</b> statement in my
lilo.conf file.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>PCMCIA Support</b></span></p><p>A large number of PCMCIA devices are supported by Linux:
modem cards, network cards, SCSI cards, combination cards and so
on.</p><p>PCMCIA isn't supported in the kernel, so you will need to use
a PCMCIA root disk which starts the PCMCIA daemon,
<span   class="bold"><b>cardmgr</b></span>. Many PCMCIA devices are
automatically supported; just insert the card, start the machine
with the PCMCIA root disk and away you go. For devices which aren't
immediately supported, you will have to do some tweaking of the
configuration files (see Resources).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>The Brute-Force Method</b></span></p><p>For older laptops, you might have no option other than the
brute-force method. My Twinhead SubNote, for instance, didn't have
a CD-ROM drive (almost no laptops had CD-ROM drives back then), and
I didn't bother buying the optional floppy drive for it. I was left
with one option: buy a 2.5-inch drive adapter for a normal IDE
controller, pop open the laptop, take out the drive, plug it into
another desktop machine, then install Linux. It is crude, but
effective.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcbfc90"></a>Networking</h2></div></div><p>You'll most likely want to have Ethernet support on your
laptop. Modem detection and configuration is fairly straightforward
on laptops (often completely automatic), since many have built-in
modems that respond normally on the serial ports to which they're
assigned. Also, most of the standard PCMCIA modem cards are easily
supported, even if they are on combo cards with Ethernet adapters,
such as the IBM Home &amp; Away card.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ethernet Configuration</b></span></p><p>For laptops which have on-board Ethernet (such as the Hitachi
VisionBook Pro 7000 series), you use the same method as for a
desktop machine to get TCP/IP networking up and running.</p><p>For PCMCIA Ethernet adapters, you will need to edit the
PCMCIA network options file, probably /etc/pcmcia/network.opts.
Editing /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 or /etc/resolv.conf won't help, because
the kernel Ethernet services won't be used.</p><p>The format of /etc/pcmcia/network.opts is straightforward; it
contains the same sort of options as in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1, as well
as <b  >DNS_1</b> through <b  >DNS_3</b>, for
specifying domain name servers, and <b  >MOUNTS</b>, for
specifying NFS mounts which also must be listed in the /etc/fstab
file. It also contains other options for configuring your Ethernet
card in the event it is not automatically supported. (See
Resources.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcc0058"></a>Switching Between ISPs</h2></div></div><p>If you are like me, you have an Ethernet network at home and
at the other places you take your laptop (a friend's house, work,
etc.). I've found that generally I have no need to use the laptop
&ldquo;in transit&rdquo;. Since it is possible that I may not get around to
plugging it into an AC adapter wherever I'm going, I don't need to
keep the machine on while I'm switching from one network to
another.</p><p>If this is also your situation, there is a simple solution.
When switching networks, all that must be changed is either the
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 and /etc/resolv.conf files, in the case of
built-in Ethernet support in your laptop, or just
/etc/pcmcia/network.opts if you are using a PCMCIA Ethernet
card.</p><p><a href="3411l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Let's say you want to call the two locations (though there
can be more) between which you want to transfer &ldquo;home&rdquo; and
&ldquo;away&rdquo;. Rename the above-mentioned files to have extensions of
.home and .away, for the configuration of each location
respectively, then use a simple shell script such as the one shown
in Listing 1 to point to the proper location. This script makes
symbolic links for each configuration file, pointing to the
corresponding location-specific file, if it exists. If it doesn't,
it won't do anything, so nothing will break.</p><p>When you are ready to shut down your laptop for the journey,
log in as root, run this program with a single command-line
argument which is the location to which you are moving (e.g.,
away), then shut it down. When you start it back up, it will be
configured for its new temporary home.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc7580.0xcc0318"></a>X Window System</h2></div></div><p>Configuring X is fairly straightforward for laptops with
supported hardware. The only place to be cautious here is making
sure you have a laptop that supports Linux with the display
hardware on the laptop (which is still somewhat proprietary, but
far less so than when laptops first began coming out), has
sufficient memory to run the X server, and runs the video mode and
bit depth you need. The newer, high-end laptops often use the
NeoMagic chip set, which is fully supported only in XFree86 3.3.2
and higher, so you may have to upgrade.</p><p>The best resource for determining whether a laptop will meet
your needs is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux on Laptops</em></span> web page
