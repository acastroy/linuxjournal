wherever you look, from elevators to power company facilities to
electron accelerators. They form a very important, though mostly
unseen, part of our lives. This month, we take a good look at how
embedded systems work and how to build one that is
cross-platform-compatible. Embedded systems require real-time
programming, and we have an article discussing this topic. Is there
truly such a thing as real time? Read it to find out.
</p><p>Linux's stability and performance make it a perfect choice
for use as an embedded system, but size is another matter.
Downsizing can be a difficult task. Just making the decisions
regarding what to cut and what to keep can be both time-consuming
and complex. Is it worth it?</p><p>One company has bet their business that it is. Caldera Thin
Clients has changed its name to Lineo, Inc. and is coming out with
an embedded Linux system. Called Embedix, this system is based on
Caldera's OpenLinux. I talked to Lineo's Lyle Ball to find out
about this product and future plans for the company. (The interview
will be in our next issue.)</p><p>Another company chose a different road. Cygnus wrote their
own embedded operating system, called eCOS, which they have
released as open source. Charles Curley has written an article
comparing eCOS to RTLinux, which appears in the &ldquo;Strictly
On-Line&rdquo; section on our web site,
http://www.linuxjournal.com/.</p><p>Elsewhere in this issue, Craig Knudsen tells us why
Transvirtual made the decision to adopt Microsoft Java Extensions,
and Michael Hammel talks about Side Effects Software, their port of
Houdini to Linux and what it means to the community.</p><p>At LinuxWorld on August 11, I had the pleasure of having
lunch with our leader, Linus Torvalds. As a change of pace for both
of us, I took the opportunity to talk to him about personal matters
rather than Linux. (<a href="../067/3655.html" target="_self">See interview in issue 67</a>.)</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p></div></div>
