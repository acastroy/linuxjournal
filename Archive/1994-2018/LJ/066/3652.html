latest release (SuSE Linux 6.2 will be available by the time you
read this) featuring the new 2.2 kernel, custom SuSE software,
commercial packages (Netscape, StarOffice with personal license,
Applixware Office, Corel WordPerfect 8.0 and many others), five
CD-ROMs' (and a disk's) worth of software, a 440-page manual and a
green chameleon sticker. This is a serious, high-performance
distribution which is more complete than practically any single
distribution, and at the same time is clean and fast due to
effective configuration and intelligent design. Much attention has
been paid to the details in this release (as in past releases), and
the production gains a lot from SuSE custom software and
configuration. Although SuSE is the top Linux distribution in
Europe, and the 1998 <i  >Linux Journal</i> Readers'
Choice for &ldquo;Best Distribution&rdquo;, it has not been particularly
successful in the U.S. The reason for this is not clear (perhaps
someone in marketing knows), but if word gets out about this
distribution, the situation is likely to change.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1d9fb88"></a>YaST</h2></div></div><p>Yet another Setup Tool is SuSE's software for installation,
de-installation and maintenance. Once a system is installed, YaST
stays around to help with many configuration tasks, and updates
system files accordingly. (For example, if you want to change
networking configuration, YaST asks what changes you want and
automatically updates all files.) YaST is also the tool that
installs the whole system in the first place.</p><p>Installation of SuSE is quite easy and extremely flexible,
although not entirely automated&mdash;SuSE begins with a default (base)
package and allows you to modify package selection to suit your
needs. You can also load a few pre-configured selections (with the
usual server, workstation, and complete installation options),
though one ought to customize even these configurations. It is
easiest just to have three or four pre-configured installations (as
with Caldera), but SuSE probably has a number of reasons for taking
the custom installation approach. For one thing, SuSE is more
complete than most other distributions (five CD-ROMs is a lot of
software, and the new 6.2 apparently has six) and customization
makes more sense when dealing with so much software. Also, SuSE
does not aim to be &ldquo;Linux for Idiots&rdquo; and would lose much of its
flexibility were it dumbed down for people who can't decide what
software they want.</p><p>One benefit of SuSE's devotion to custom installation is that
SuSE has developed a system which incorporates many packages into
the menuing system of KDE. In addition, YaST knows what
dependencies the packages (numbering about 1000 for 6.1 and 1300
for the brand-new 6.2) have, and can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> install these dependencies. YaST
keeps track of redundancies to warn a user against installing
software packages that are too similar or would be unused. Also,
YaST has good descriptions of the software packages, so you always
know what you're going to get (well, except for the occasional !!
HIER FEHLT DAS LABEL !!). In these areas, SuSE is unique. For
example, Red Hat offers far fewer packages and mostly does not
incorporate selected programs into menuing systems. Caldera also
offers fewer packages, and while it effectively incorporates
programs into KDE, it offers four installation packages and no
custom option. However, Caldera's installation program, Lizard, is
probably the easiest.</p><p>Installation can take place in over a dozen languages
(English is second on this list). Before installation begins, you
have to load any special drivers you might need. Secretly, I wish
SuSE would autoprobe, and in fact there is an automatic detection
for necessary modules which actually works, but you have to find it
first. Once the modules are taken care of, proper installation can
begin.</p><p>Ultimately, installation is straightforward and easy to
navigate, but, like Red Hat, often requires you to know what
hardware you have. I would prefer more probing and perhaps more
complete default installations (I had to select so many packages,
it took a while), but there were no technical hang-ups, freezes or
crashes. Manual configuration of networking was just like most
distributions, and the system was booted and on-line fairly
quickly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1d9fe48"></a>SaX</h2></div></div><p>SuSE Advanced X Configuration Tool (SaX) is a graphical
interface for configuring X (and we all know how much of a pain
that can be). You can navigate its menus with the mouse or the
keyboard, and all you have to do is choose your mouse, graphics
card and monitor from a few lists and an XF86Config file is
created. I noticed that the lists were not as long as I have
encountered elsewhere, and some older hardware was missing. SaX
configures your keyboard and mouse as well and offers many expert
configuration options.</p><p>Once you have finished with basic configuration, SaX allows
you to test the video modes and make real-time adjustments, rather
like <span   class="bold"><b>xvidtune</b></span> but graphical and
easier to use. You get to see the standard X test pattern for a
little while, and that's nice, but I would still prefer keeping it
up all the time to get a better idea of how well the screen is
configured. It's very simple to use, and if it doesn't work, you
can always try the xf86setup or xf86config. Even after your system
configured, you can use SaX to update your configuration in case
you would like to use higher resolution, a new video card or a new
monitor. This is unlike other installers which configure once
during installation and require the use of external software or
manual modifications afterwards. Once the XF86Config file is
created, it's time to try out X.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1da0000"></a>The X Window Manager</h2></div></div><p>The default window manager on SuSE Linux 6.1 is KDE, which
has, in addition to its standard menus and KDE software, a SuSE
menu housing entries for many of the various packages installed by
YaST. Also configured in the menuing system are the various Applix
programs, though at the moment they insist the license is out of
date. (I hope this is corrected in 6.2.) SuSE's custom menus have
more to offer than the custom menus of most other distributions,
even though some menu options don't work and many installed
software packages are not incorporated into the menuing system.
Still, it is a clever idea to have YaST configuring KDE's menus
during installation in such a way as to have optional packages
included. If SuSE had more time to devote to going over the
packages and making sure they all were properly collected into the
menu tree, the system would be really neat. (The next step would be
automatic real-time updating of the menu trees to correspond with
the software on the system...)</p><p><a href="3652f2.jpg" target="_self">Screen Shot</a></p><p>On the whole, SuSE's window manager works just fine. You
might have to know enough during installation to select the right
XF86 server, however. SuSE's menuing system looks quite neat, and
for the most part, files seem to be in the right places. No menu
selections I found led to core dumps or worse, and although many of
the packages I installed did not get entered into the menus (and
some selections didn't do anything), you can do a lot with KDE as
installed on SuSE. If you like GUIs (I, for one, vastly prefer
consoles), KDE is very functional.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1da0210"></a>Technical Concerns</h2></div></div><p>It is difficult to say anything bad about a Linux
distribution; after all, they're all based on Linux and GNU
software. Nevertheless, concerns sometimes arise over the decisions
made about which programs and versions are used, and sometimes
things just don't work. Where installation is concerned,
auto-installers are nice when they work, but probing often crashes
the system. On the other side, many people have no idea what
hardware is inside their system and what IRQ and DMA values they
ought to enter. Preconfigured package collections are convenient
but lose flexibility, whereas manual selection of packages takes
forever. Experimental software usually has enhanced functionality
over stable software but often fails unexpectedly, as many of you
know who simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> run the latest
kernel/library/compiler, even when parts of it aren't
working.</p><p>The choices to be made by a distributor can be difficult, and
the practice of targeting a specific audience guides distributors
in their decisions. Although I've recently been recommending SuSE
when asked by newbies which distribution to install, I am aware
it's not for computer illiterates. At the same time, it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> easy to install and use and is rather
well-endowed. It appears to be an ideal distribution for the middle
68% of Linux users, often choosing ease-of-use and stability over
the cutting edge, while at the same time favoring maximum
functionality and flexibility against oversimplification. The
installation and configuration utilities (YaST and SaX) are
examples of the latter, while the choice between gcc and egcs is an
example of the former and latter, respectively.</p><p>I tried compiling a number of &ldquo;problem&rdquo; packages, sources
that have always &ldquo;bugged out&rdquo; when I tried to compile them in the
past, and every single time, SuSE compiled without error.
Obviously, SuSE must have functional libraries in the right
locations. (This was a problem with certain distributions years
ago.) The kernel has never been one of those problem packages, and
recompilation/installation went very smoothly. SuSE has a KDE menu
item which starts up the kernel recompilation&mdash;another clue that
SuSE is geared towards non-neophytes. Upon reboot, everything was
in the right place and all the modules worked. This probably has
more to do with kernel developers than with SuSE, but someone truly
clever could have contrived a way to stop a kernel and its modules
from working. In any event, kernel recompilation worked even better
on SuSE than on Red Hat (which had some complications involving
modules) and Caldera (which isn't targeted at kernel hackers
anyway), although Slackware has never presented me with any
problems.</p><p>SuSE Linux 6.1 has a lot of small things going for it, such
as a different color scheme for the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, syslog messages logged
to <b  >alt-F10</b>, a first console which does not clear
the screen on logout/login (so you can still read system messages
from startup, etc.) and various other details. Unlike Red Hat, SuSE
does not stick its logo all over the desktop (or on every single
window, as many of you may remember). On the whole, SuSE has a
cool, modern feeling to it&mdash;it isn't obnoxious. SuSE has not bent
over backwards to make system configuration easy for the
command-line impaired, so the system itself is not overly
complicated or obtuse, yet it still works. And if it doesn't work,
there's always support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1da0580"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>The general failing of most distributors is poor support.
However, Linux firms have recently been putting increased effort
into providing better support, and third parties such as Linuxcare
are raising standards in the industry. Support from SuSE comes not
only as &ldquo;tree-ware&rdquo;, but as 60 days of e-mail/phone support. If,
after 60 days, you can't get your system installed, buy a Mac or
try one of the new pre-installed systems. I have not yet heard a
complaint about SuSE support, and I expect that SuSE must be
competent in this department&mdash;SuSE claims 35,000 business customers
(including Mercedes-Benz), and businesses have a low tolerance for
bad technical assistance.</p><p>The best support in my opinion is an excellent manual, and
SuSE has done a superb job here. Just like SuSE's custom software
(and the distribution itself), the manual is a product of
thoughtfulness, attention to detail and cohesive design. The book
is 440 pages, but quite dense&mdash;nothing is watered down, and even
simplifications have footnotes explaining what the reality is. An
example of this simplification and explanation approach is that the
installation guide has a section for &ldquo;quick install&rdquo;, as well as
an in-depth section on the whole installation procedure and its
options. The book is also not condescending, and I find that
refreshing.</p><p>The manual is divided into eight parts: Introduction, Install
SuSE Linux, Network Configuration, The X Window System, Linux and
Hardware, The Kernel and Its Parameters, SuSE Linux: Update and
Specialties, and Security and Hints. The last of these chapters
actually contains an introduction to Linux as well as the immortal
line, &ldquo;natural disasters such as lightning strikes, floods and
earthquakes can damage your computer&rdquo;. There is a bit of humor and
some math in the book, and a noticeably &ldquo;green&rdquo; feel: the
computer system in the book is named &ldquo;earth&rdquo;, and the manual says
of the free books included in PostScript format, &ldquo;If you don't
care about trees, you can print them as well.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca7580.0x1da0738"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>SuSE Linux is a complete Linux distribution aimed at
non-neophytes or perhaps neophytes who are good with computers.
Although the price might suggest it is worth less than a copy of
Windows (or some very expensive Linux distribution), it is quite
difficult to do better for the money. Like any Linux distribution,
there are menu options which don't work and software that's missing
from the menu selections. The default package collections are good
enough, but it's worth the time to step through every package and
decide whether or not you want it. If you're going to get a
commercial Linux distribution, you'll do well to consider SuSE&mdash;at
the very least, you get several CD-ROMs' worth of software, good
news if your CD-ROM drive is faster than your Internet connection.
When the new SuSE Linux 6.2 arrives (with the 2.2.10 kernel and a
whole bunch of new software), it will definitely be one to check
out.</p><p><a href="3652s1.html" target="_self">News Brief</a></p></div></div>
