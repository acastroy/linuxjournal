much time was spent putting it together. The book is divided into
eight parts, each containing one or more chapters.</p><p>Chapter 1 is a small but very useful chapter. It explains how
Perl can be used and which platforms support it. The most important
paragraph in this chapter is &ldquo;Perl Resources&rdquo;. All well-known
resources are mentioned here: newsgroups, FAQs (frequently asked
questions), web pages and other books from the publisher.</p><p>Now that you know how to get Perl, it is time you got it
installed. Specific installation topics like installing modules and
documentation are explained in Chapter 2.</p><p>In Chapter 3, the Perl interpreter and its options are
explained from command-line to environment variables. Chapter 4
explains the program structure. This chapter and the following one
are good references for anyone already familiar with Perl or
another programming language. If you are totally new to programming
and you want to learn Perl, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning
Perl</em></span> (Randal L. Swartz and Tom Christianson, also from
O'Reilly) might be a better place to start.</p><p>Chapter 5 gives brief descriptions of the built-in functions.
Each description covers the syntax of the function, with the types
and order of its arguments. Since no one writes perfect code all
the time, the debugger is explained with its various options.
Packages, modules and objects are discussed in chapters 7 and 8. A
short explanation and an example give you a good idea of how each
standard module, delivered with Perl, is used.</p><p>CGI is covered in chapters 9 through 11. I feel this section
will be used the most, because CGI together with the Internet is
such a hot item. Many web pages make use of CGI scripts.</p><p>Chapter 11 discusses the useful things which can be done by
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> as it merges Perl into
the Apache web server. This module will reduce the forking of extra
processes each time a script is executed. Installing this module
and making use of its capabilities can speed up execution on the
server.</p><p>Chapter 12 explains the connection between databases and
Perl. Databases are also a hot item on the Internet these days. DBM
(database management) and DBI (database interface) are covered in
this chapter.</p><p>Network topics such as sockets, e-mail, news, FTP and LWP
(library for web access in Perl) are discussed in part six. Each
chapter starts with a short description of the service, followed by
the key words in alphabetical order along with their uses.</p><p>Perl/Tk is discussed in Chapter 18. I did some design work
with Tcl/Tk in the past, and was amazed at how easy it was to get
something done. With Perl and Tk, it is even simpler. Using the
examples, you can quickly design some nice things.</p><p>The last chapter covers Win32 modules and extensions. With
the information provided in this chapter, you could create some
nice things in the Microsoft world.</p><p>The index may be the most important part of a book, in my
opinion. A bad index will cost you time when searching for topics
in a book. This index is so complete, you will easily find any
desired information.</p><p>This book was hard to review, because it is a reference
guide. One thing is clear: the authors have made it a good
reference guide. This book is a must for people who already know
Perl and want to learn more. The information you need is easy to
find and understand due to clearly written text and good
examples.</p></div></div>
