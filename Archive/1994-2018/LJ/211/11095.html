An update on the One Laptop Per Child Project.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb05580.0xbfd2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Just the other day, I ran into someone in the parking lot, who looked at
the silly-looking green laptop slung across my shoulder and said &ldquo;Didn't
the founder of that project ditch and disappear?&rdquo; News travels fast, no
matter where it comes from, and no matter how wrong it is. I'm amused.
</p><p>
Of course, I am talking about the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) Project,
founded by Professor Nicholas Negroponte in 2005. Conceived as a learning
project at MIT back in the early 1980s (with Professor Seymour Papert), it
morphed into a laptop project in Cambodia in 1999 and eventually into the
current OLPC Project in 2005. OLPC currently has
more than two million laptops
in the hands of children in more than 25 languages in more than 40
countries.
</p><p>
I got involved in July 2007, when I first saw the XO laptop at
OSCON (thanks to Rob Savoye) and instantly fell in love with it. I
quickly signed up with the developer program and got myself a beta
machine. However, unlike my short-lived affairs with other gadgets,
I've hung onto this one for more than four years now. Along the way, I
became the de facto organizer for the OLPC San Francisco volunteer
community. OLPC also has found a spot on my research agenda. I now run
projects in Jamaica, India and Tuva (yes, that Tuva, of Richard Feynman
fame),
and I help out with others in Armenia, Madagascar, Morocco and a whole
bunch of other places. Making technology work in remote places has been
a welcome challenge. Making it work for children the world over has been
a fulfilling experience.

Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Speaking of laptops, the lean, green children's machine is quite the
icon. It gathers crowds with little effort. It brings forth the inner
child in many a tough adult. Let's take a peek into what's under
the plastic. Table 1 shows the different incarnations of the OLPC XO laptop.

The XO has many cool features. It is rugged, solar-chargeable, has a
sunlight-readable screen, supports mesh networking and has a very aggressive
suspend-resume cycle, but the importance of these features supersedes their
coolness when deployed in the field. One of my projects is in
Bhagmalpur, a rural village in northern India. Bhagmalpur is close to my
heart. A part of my family lives there, and keeping up with the village
helps me stay grounded in their realities. I have learned much from them
(I can milk a cow!), and I am glad to be able to give back. Bhagmalpur
is beautiful, but it has its own problems. Electricity is elusive at
best. There's no Wi-Fi. Internet access rarely works, and when it does,
it trickles. There are no classrooms; the kids sit under a tree. This is
where
we see the real benefits of sunlight-readable screens, solar chargers,
under-a-tree mesh-networking technology and aggressive suspend-resume
cycles that conserve every fraction of a watt. All of this made possible
by a combination of free and open-source software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb05580.0xbfe9b0"></a>
Internet in a Box</h2></div></div><p>
Another neat setup we have in Bhagmalpur is an off-line
server. Remember SneakerNet from the days of tapes and
floppies? SneakerNet is a wonderful concept. You can think of it as
a kind of mirroring with a very high latency. Given that about 70%
of the world's population still is not on the public Internet,
SneakerNet approaches become important stopgap measures. OLPC has a
Fedora-based image (called the XS) that is designed to run an off-line
server at the local school, village or library. Think of it as an
&ldquo;Internet in a box&rdquo;. Yes, it's not the entire Internet, but storage
is cheap these days. You can pack plenty of content on a 2TB drive, be
it Khan Academy videos, TED Talks, books from Project Gutenberg,
the Internet Archive, Wikipedia and so on. This approach acts as a
stopgap, so that we can get the kids access to some information at least
for now. Eventually, when the Internet gets there 24/7, this server can
continue to function as a conduit to the outside.
</p><p>
The school server runs on x86 machines (ours in Bhagmalpur draws 8 watts)
and provides a plethora of services. The design of this server revolves
around Moodle, a learning management system. Some of the administrative
capabilities also are plugged in to Moodle, so teachers don't have
to drop to a command line to administer the server. Other services that
run on the XS are Apache, PHP and PostgreSQL (to run Moodle), ejabberd
(to provide XMPP-based collaborative services), Squid, DHCP, DNS and a
few others. In the Bhagmalpur setup, we also use Munin to keep an eye on
server health and OpenVPN to tunnel back to San Francisco to pull logs
and to push content via rsync. The server not only serves up content
and courses, but it also seamlessly backs up each laptop's datastore,
pushes both OS and application updates, manages theft deterrence,
network access and more.
</p><p>
The XS is designed to follow a curricular model, complete with
courses, teachers, students, enrollment and assessment all managed
via Moodle. However, in some instances, a curricular model isn't
suitable. Sometimes we simply don't have a functional school in the
neighborhood. In such cases, a reference library is more apt. There's
a parallel effort to fill the need for an off-line digital library,
but without a specific curricular underpinning. Pathagar (in Bengali,
path=lesson, agar=repository) is a Django-based digital library that
serves up an XML catalog of content using the Open Publication Distribution
System (OPDS). Content can be searched and downloaded using a browser
or custom reader. Uruguay has been using Pathagar in production for
some time now. We are testing it for Bhagmalpur (using Debian Squeeze
on a SheevaPlug) right now and hope to put it into production soon.

Deployments</h2></div></div><p>
OLPC projects come in all sizes. Projects that implement laptops in the
field are called deployments. There are large, top-down OLPC-managed
deployments and small third-party deployments managed by NGOs and
volunteer communities. As Professor Negroponte puts it, uppercase OLPC is the
&ldquo;official&rdquo; effort, whereas lowercase olpc is the community effort. Of
course, one without the other wouldn't get very far. Uppercase deployments,
like Peru, are the largest with almost a million machines. Uruguay follows
closely with 100% saturation at the primary school level, and Rwanda
recently crossed the 100,000 laptop mark. In the lowercase olpc realm
there are several projects with much less volume, but nevertheless, a
strong intent. Some are in the hundreds, like my projects with the
University of the West Indies in Jamaica. Others are in the tens,
like the effort in Bhagmalpur. We even have some efforts with a single
eBay-bought XO laptop lighting up someone's world somewhere. It's a
spark that holds the potential to ignite.
</p><p>
Keeping track of smaller deployments is difficult. We have two planet
feeds to keep track of various deployments (see Resources). We also have
an effort to map the community at large&mdash;who they are, where they live,
what they do and whom they work with. olpcMAP.net maps out deployments,
projects and volunteers from Armenia to Zambia, with language translation
efforts from Amazigh to Zulu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb05580.0xbf57c0"></a>
Kids Like Sugar</h2></div></div><p>
Looking past the hardware, one of the key features of OLPC deployments is
its software&mdash;more precisely, its software as a learning platform. Sugar
is a learning platform designed for children. It originally was designed
for the OLPC XO laptop, but since then it has grown to run on most Netbooks and
PCs. Sugar is used by more than two million students in Peru, Uruguay,
Rwanda, Nepal, the United States and more than 40 other countries.
</p><p>
Sugar is distributed as free software, released under GPL v2. It
is available in more than 25 languages, although the translation
infrastructure has 132 languages in various stages of completion. Sugar
is a collaborative learning platform that promotes collaborative
learning. Sugar also can be viewed as a graphical user interface and
a collection of software applications (called Activities) that give
children a rich environment for learning.
</p><p>
The Sugar user interface is very simple. It has a &ldquo;low floor&rdquo;,
so that even children as young as ages two and three can start to
use it. At the same time, it puts no limit on what they can achieve.
Children can use Sugar to reach very complex ideas. They are not
bound by its simplicity; rather, they use its simplicity as a catalyst
for growth. Sugar presents no &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; to the learner. In fact,
each application ships with its source code (usually Python) and can be
viewed and modified in much the same way as with HTML.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11095f3.large.jpg"><img src="11095f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Sugar View Source Option 
</p></div></div><p>
Sugar has built-in mechanisms for collaboration using an XMPP-based
layer that allows for applications to share data across the network. For
instance, the Write Activity (based on AbiWord) can &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to another
child's Write Activity over the network and allow for real-time,
collaborative word processing. This is very much like what you may see
with Google Docs, but without Google in the middle. It's agnostic
of the network layer, so the collaboration can work between two laptops
meshed together under a tree or two laptops connected over the Internet
reaching across continents.
</p><p>
Sugar maintains a journal, a diary of sorts, of everything a child does.
It is a record of both what things learners make and how they made them. This
journal runs on top of an XML datastore written in Python and works as
a flat, time-based listing, sortable by time, topic, mime-type and so on, and
it allows children to resume work where they left off. The journal also allows
for reflecting upon one's work by taking notes once each activity is
done. Looking at these notes over time should give students a sense of how
their work has evolved. In all, Sugar is not about instruction; it is
about learning.
</p><p>
Sugar Activities come in many flavors. Some, such as the Browse activity
(based on Firefox) rely on the network extensively, while others, such as
the Wikipedia bundle, are completely off-line. Then, there's the physical
computing kind of activity. Activities like Scratch and Turtle Art interface with
the 3-D real world using Arduino boards and LEGO robots. Taking
a cue from the Uruguayans who are building Arduino-based XO robots and
the Peruvians who are distributing 92,000 LEGO robotics kits to their
schools, we have started exploring the use of LEGO WeDo robotics kits
in Jamaica. The charge is being led by a ten-year old Jamaican kid!
</p><p>
Then there is the Measure activity, an oscilloscope of sorts, reading
from the microphone port for sensor data. How many overtones do throat
singers of Tuva produce? Measure can tell you&mdash;think lemon batteries,
conductive playdough and electromagnetic speedometers. Now we are talking
real education! The list goes on, but you can explore all of these on
the Sugar Activities repository.

</p></div></div><p>
On the technical side, all of OLPC's XO images are Fedora-based
(Fedora 14 at the time of this writing). Sugar runs on top of Fedora
(OLPC also packs a GNOME option for older kids). Sugar is primarily
written in Python, using PyGTK extensively. Sugar uses an interesting
security spec called Bitfrost. Creating Activities in Sugar is easy once
you understand Sugar's human interface guidelines. Many existing GTK
apps can be &ldquo;sugarized&rdquo; easily as well. Although those details are out
of the scope of this article, a good place to start is James Simmons'
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Make Your Own Sugar Activities!</em></span> (see Resources).
</p><p>
Sugar Labs is the current home of the Sugar Project. Started as a
spin-off from OLPC, it is headed by Walter Bender as its Executive
Director. Sugar Labs is a volunteer-driven, nonprofit organization,
and a member project of the Software Freedom Conservancy. It coordinates
volunteers&mdash;an international community of teachers, software developers,
artists, writers, parents and children&mdash;who are passionate about
providing educational opportunities to children through the Sugar
Learning Platform. Children as young as 12 years old have written Sugar
Activities. When a 12-year-old developer walked into one of our OLPC
San Francisco meetings, we thought he was lost and looking for
his parents!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In all, the project is alive and well. Every single laptop out there
counts as one more platform of information&mdash;both for access and for
creation. Young minds all over are starting to get opportunities to
connect the dots with the rest of the world. These are not cheap
laptops. These are little Linux-powered revolution machines, and
the revolution is on. So, come and join us. Bring meaningful and
participatory education to millions. Stand up and make your mark for
those who cannot. Help them solve their own problems. Start tiny sparks,
so that some day, we may light up the world.
</p><p>
Before I wrap up, I should set the record straight. I have been
approached by several people who ask, &ldquo;Didn't OLPC switch over
to Windows?&rdquo; This myth also is a popular point of contention on
sites like Slashdot to which John Waltington (OLPC's VP for Hardware
Engineering) replied: &ldquo;Linux has shipped, and will continue to ship,
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> XO produced. You can believe random commenters, or you can
believe the person who signs off on every SKU produced.&rdquo; Two million+
laptops <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> shipped with Linux. There you have it, straight from the man.
