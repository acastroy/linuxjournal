vDSO, or virtual dynamic shared object, is a clever feature of the Linux
kernel used to speed up certain system calls and access data in
separate memory segments efficiently.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e2580.0x14da1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object) is an alternative to the
somewhat cycle-expensive system call interface that the GNU/Linux kernel
provides. But, before I explain how to cook up your own vDSO, in this brief jaunt down
operating system lane, I cover some basics of vDSOs, what they are and why
they are useful. The main purpose of this article is to illustrate how to add a
custom vDSO to a Linux kernel and then how to use the fruits of your labor.
This is not intended to be a vDSO 101; if you would like more in-depth
information, see the links in the Resources section of this article.

vDSO Basics</h2></div></div><p>
The traditional mechanism of communication between userland
applications and the kernel is something called a system call. Syscalls are
implemented as software interrupts providing the userland application with some
kernel functionality. For instance, <tt  >gettimeofday()</tt>
and <tt  >fork()</tt> are both
system calls. The reason syscalls exist is due to the fact that the Linux
kernel is divided into two primary segments of memory: userland and kernel
land.
Userland is where common programs, including d&aelig;mons and servers, execute.
Kernel land is where the kernel schedules processes and does all of its nifty
kernel-specific magic. This division in memory acts as a safety barrier between
user applications and the kernel. The only way a user application even
can touch the kernel is via system call communication. Therefore, the robustness
and integrity of the kernel is protected by the limited set of routines it
provides userland access to, the system calls.
</p><p>
To accomplish a syscall, the kernel must flip-flop memory contexts: storing the
userland CPU registers, looking up the syscall in the interrupt vector of
syscalls (the syscall vector is initialized at boot time) and then
processing the
syscall. Once the syscall has been processed in kernel land, the kernel must
restore the registers from the previously stored userland context. This
completes the syscall; however, as you can imagine, this is not a tax-free
series of events. Numerous cycles are spun just to make these special kinds of
function calls.
</p><p>
Although this segmentation sounds great for the security world, it does not always
provide the most efficient means of communication. Certain functions that do
not write any data and merely return a value stored in the kernel, such as
<tt  >gettimeofday()</tt>, are relatively safe in nature and provide no threat to the
kernel from the requesting userland application. Wouldn't it be nice if
you
could make safe functions not have to do the memory-barrier tango? Well,
you
can&mdash;with vDSO!
</p><p>
You're probably wondering how a vDSO gets placed into a program in the first
place, over the traditional syscall. Well, vDSO hooks are provided via the
glibc library. The linker will link in the glibc vDSO functionality, provided
that such a routine has an accompanying vDSO version, such as
<tt  >gettimeofday()</tt>.
When your program executes, if your kernel does not have vDSO support, a
traditional syscall will be made. This test of vDSO functionality is provided
by the code linked from glibc. Of course, you don't want to hack up glibc
just so you can have your home-brewed vDSO run. The method for creating a
vDSO described below does not require modification of glibc; instead it relies
on hacking up the kernel, as expected.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e2580.0x14da778"></a>
Cluck, Cluck...vDSO</h2></div></div><p>
These safe syscalls can be implemented on a page of virtual memory that can be
mapped into each running process' memory. This implementation is similar to how
other dynamically shared objects are mapped into a process, such as shared
libraries. In fact, if you were to extract the page from memory and disassemble
it, the result is a shared-library ELF. In other words, the vDSO is just a
shared library (sorry to blow the magic for you). With this page of
safe syscall routines resident to the userland application, a program can make
the call and not have to endure the overhead of the memory-hopping between user
and kernel segments that a traditional syscall would require. One perfect
example is <tt  >gettimeofday()</tt>. This routine not only is
timing-sensitive,
but it often is a routine that is used at a high frequency. Consider that it takes
the kernel time to hop memory segments. Once the clock is sampled, cycles must
be spent to flip memory segments. The longer this takes, the less accurate the
returned time value will be.

Let's Get Frying'</h2></div></div><p>
Enough with theory and all that mumbo-jumbo, let's get to what
this article is all about&mdash;making your own vDSO. This article assumes
a 64-bit x86 processor using the 2.6.37 Linux kernel.
You'll probably be surprised at how easy this is. It is even less involved than
making a traditional syscall. The confusing part comes when trying to share
data via variables between kernel and userland.
</p><p>
Let's create a syscall that does something basic&mdash;say, produce an integer
value of, oh, the number of the beast, 666. For all instructive
purposes, let's call this function, number_of_the_beast(). Because I'm not sure
that the true number of the beast is static (hey, beasts might change),
let's
make this function do just that, tell us the number of the beast. (It could be
like a president and change every few years.) 
Create a file in
linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso/ called vnumber_of_the_beast.c, and inside
there,
define your function:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;asm/linkage.h&gt;

notrace int __vdso_number_of_the_beast(void)
{
    return 0xDEAD - 56339;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The only interesting/unusual thing here is the
<tt  >notrace</tt> macro. It is defined
in linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/include/asm/linkage.h as being:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define notrace __attribute__((no_instrument_function))
</pre>
</p><p>
The above GNU extension tells the gcc compiler that when it compiles
the function to exclude hooks supporting profiling feedback. Profiling
feedback can be built in, if the <tt  >notrace</tt> macro is removed and if the gcc flag
<tt  >-finstrument-functions</tt> was passed to the gcc at
compile time (see the GCC Manual, listed in Resources).
</p><p>
You also need to tell the compiler to link a userland-accessible function
called <tt  >number_of_the_beast</tt>, which is also a weak symbol. Weak symbols
represent data, such as function calls, that do not resolve until runtime. The
word &ldquo;weak&rdquo; simply means the symbol can be overridden. If the symbol does not exist,
no warnings are issued, as no symbol is acceptable in this case. The alias
associates the local <tt  >__vdso_number_of_the_beast</tt>
to the world-accessible version, <tt  >number_of_the_beast</tt>. Add the following piece
just after the function previously added:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int number_of_the_beast(void)
    __attribute__((weak, alias("__vdso_number_of_the_beast")));
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you just need to toss in some pieces to the linker script so that when the
kernel builds, your code will get built and linked into the
<tt  >vdso.so</tt> shared
object. That is what you will use for your hook when writing code that uses the
vDSO. Now, bust out your text editor and modify
linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso/vdso.lds.S to add the function names you just added:


<pre     class="programlisting">
VERSION {
    LINUX_2.6 {
        global:
            clock_gettime;
            __vdso_clock_gettime;
            gettimeofday;
            __vdso_gettimeofday;
            getcpu;
            __vdso_getcpu;

            /* ADD YOUR VDSO STUFF HERE */
            number_of_the_beast;
            __vdso_number_of_the_beast;
        local: *;
    };
}
</pre>
</p><p>
One more thing, you need to tell the compiler actually to compile the
information in <tt  >vnumber_of_the_beast.c</tt>. To do this,
just toss some information into
the Makefile located in linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso/Makefile. Add the
name of the file, with a .o instead of a .c extension. And, through
<tt  >make</tt>
wizardry and black magic, it will be compiled at compile time. Again, break
out the text editor, and add the name to the list of object files for the
variable <tt  >vobjs-y</tt>. Your result should look something
similar to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# files to link into the vdso
vobjs-y := vdso-note.o vclock_gettime.o vgetcpu.o 
 &#8618;vvar.o vnumber_of_the_beast.o
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e2580.0x14db2d0"></a>
And Now Some Special Sauce</h2></div></div><p>
If the vDSO is operating in userland, how do you
access kernel-land variables?
After all, if vDSOs are supposed to provide kernel information, don't they have to
trip the userland/kernel-land memory segment? And, wouldn't that flip-flopping of
memory context render a vDSO useless? Well, it all depends how the userland
version, the vDSO version, accesses the kernel data. For
<tt  >gettimeofday()</tt>, a
special time variable is mapped into memory where the kernel updates it and the
userland (vDSO version) can read it. The kernel merely copies what it knows
about time into that variable, and when a vDSO is made, that call just reads the
information saving the overhead of crossing memory segments. The addition or
access of a kernel variable is fairly involved as compared to a basic vDSO
function, but because the purpose of a vDSO is to access kernel information, such
as that provided in variables, I probably should give a quick overview
of doing that.
</p><p>
For illustrative purposes, let's add a value that lives in kernel land but
is read from userland. Sure, I said earlier that this mystical number might
change and you should implement a function to return it. Well, you have a
function, but all you know now is the value and not what it might change to in
the future. Let's make the function return a value, nonconstant. Wow, this
use case is becoming really unusual. To elaborate, let's update this variable
as the kernel requests. The kernel will update the vDSO variables
in the <tt  >update_vsyscall()</tt> function located in
linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/kernel.
</p><p>
If you were to declare it <tt  >const int vnotb = 666;</tt>, the value captured there would
not be set (more on this later).
</p><p>
Let's define the value to be, in fact, the mysterious number of the beast
itself, which I will call <tt  >vnotb</tt>. This number will reside in
kernel land, as so many other useful values, such as time, which the efficient
<tt  >gettimeofday()</tt> vDSO will obtain. This is where the true magic of vDSOs lie.
</p><p>
Let's remain in linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso and modify all the
goodies here. First, declare the variable via the
<tt  >VEXTERN()</tt> macro. In
vextern.h, add your declaration alongside all the other declarations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VEXTERN(vnotb)
</pre>
</p><p>
This macro will create a variable that is a pointer to the value you care about
and is prefixed with <tt  >vdso_</tt>. In essence, you have declared vnotb as
<tt  >int *vdso_vnotb;</tt>.
</p><p>
vextern.h mentions that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Any kernel variables used in the vDSO must be exported in the main kernel's
vmlinux.lds.S/vsyscall.h/proper__section and put into vextern.h and be
referenced as a pointer with vdso prefix. The main kernel later fills in
the values (comment in linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso/vextern.h).

</p></blockquote></div><p>
Now that you have some of the vDSO code in place, the userland stuff and the
kernel-userland mapping, let's make use of it. In the function
<tt  >vget_number_of_the_beast()</tt>, let's return the value:


<pre     class="programlisting">
notrace int __vdso_number_of_the_beast(void)
{
    return *vdso_vnotb;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't forget to add the header that declares that value,
<tt  >vextern.h</tt> as well as
an additional header that will resolve some data referenced by the latter,
<tt  >vgtod.h</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;asm/vgtod.h&gt;
#include "vextern.h"

</pre>
</p><p>
To wrap things up, you need to let the kernel know about this variable so it
can pump data into it. You need the kernel to give userland a value.
Well, you
have it mapped at the address specified above, but that is rather
pointless,
unless Mr Sanders, the colonel, doesn't push some data into it. You need to
go up one directory (yes, this isn't the most trivial of processes). Hop
into linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/kernel. You need to let the linker know of this
value, so it can map between kernel and userland, so you probably should rock
that. Modify vmlinux.lds.S, and add the following after the
<tt  >vgetcpu_mode</tt>
piece (note that adding it after or before
<tt  >vgetcpu_mode</tt> isn't necessary, but it's
an easy place to find things):

<pre     class="programlisting">
.vnotb : AT(VLOAD(.vnotb)) {
        *(.vnotb)
}
vnotb = VVIRT(.vnotb);
</pre>
</p><p>
This links the <tt  >vnotb</tt> symbol with the variable
<tt  >vnotb</tt>.
This sets up the variable in the address space for kernel land to access
and write to. The macros above, <tt  >AT</tt>,
<tt  >VLOAD</tt> and <tt  >VVIRT</tt> deal with modifying
addresses so that the proper piece of data, at the
<tt  >vnotb</tt>, is referenced.
</p><p>
Now, you need to declare the value that the kernel land will write to. In
linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/include/asm/vsyscall.h declare this puppy and its
section that will be inserted via the above linker script entry you most recently
added:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define __section_vnotb __attribute__ ((unused, 
 &#8618;__section__ (".vnotb"), aligned(16)))
</pre>
</p><p>
In this file, as mentioned, you also will declare the kernel-land variable
to which
the kernel will write. To keep things slightly more readable, associate your
variable next to the <tt  >vgetcpu_mode</tt> declaration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
extern int vnotb;
</pre>
</p><p>
You also will define a value the kernel can read (I don't use this in my
example, but if the kernel needs to read the value, this is the variable to
read):


<pre     class="programlisting">
extern int __vnotb;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's put this stuff in code and give it a value. The kernel will write the
value via the writable <tt  >vnotb</tt>, and you also can read it from the shared memory
between kernel and userland via <tt  >__vnotb</tt>. You will write the value in the
kernel-land version of the variable, which is writable. In
linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall_64.c, preferably
after all of the #include headers and just after the piece: <tt  >int __vgetcpu_mode
__section_vgetcpu_mode;</tt>, add the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int __vnotb __section_vnotb;
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember, you did a trick with the linker setting the value. If you
set the value globally, as you would for an extern, you would not get a value, the
linker would override it. You need to set this value at runtime and not
statically at compile time. To set this value as the kernel updates, modify
the update_vsyscall() routine in linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall_64.c
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vnotb = 666;
</pre>
</p><p>
This statement is defining the value declared previously in vsyscall.h.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e2580.0x14d2fa8"></a>
Compiling, Linking and Running</h2></div></div><p>
Wait, is that all there is to adding a vDSO? Um, yes. Of course, if the
function was something supported by the C library (glibc, in our case), you
can hack that to do the detection of vDSO and then the actual call. However,
I mentioned we wouldn't be hacking glibc. And, you don't need to anyway,
because getting the
code to work is pretty simple. With the chunks described above all in
place, it's time to start building. Just configure and compile your kernel as
you typically would:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make menuconfig
make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, install and boot your new modified vDSO kernel. Once that is up and
running, it's time to test a few things, mainly the vDSO stuff you just
added. Let's compile a test case to exercise the vDSO call:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* notb.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int notb = number_of_the_beast();
	
    printf("His number is %d\n", notb);

    return 0;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, compile the code above as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc notb.c -o notb vdso.so
</pre>
</p><p>
The file you link against is vdso.so, which provides the symbol resolution needed
to make the kernel call. The kernel version of
<tt  >number_of_the_beast()</tt> is
called, even if the code for that function is completely different in vdso.so.
Where is vdso.so located? It's located in the kernel build directory
after building the kernel: linux-2.6.37/arch/x86/vdso/vdso.so.
</p><p>
At runtime, when a program executes
<tt  >number_of_the_beast</tt>, the kernel code is
called and not the version of <tt  >number_of_the_beast()</tt> in the vdso.so file.
If you modify the kernel and, say, have
<tt  >number_of_the_beast()</tt> return
<tt  >42</tt>,
then unless you load that kernel, you still will get
<tt  >666</tt>. Even if you
compile the test example above with the newer modified-to-42 vdso.so.
</p><p>
Another way of getting the vdso.so file is by writing a program that extracts
the vDSO memory from a running executable. Numerous sources on-line
explain
how to do this, but I briefly describe it here. 
The vDSO page, which is mapped
into the memory of every running process, can be in a non-deterministic memory
range of your executing process, thanks to Linux's address space layout
randomization (ASLR). To get this address, a running program can find its
memory information from the file /proc/self/maps. In there, a line with the
text <tt  >[vdso]</tt> exists. That line contains the address range in the executing
process of the vDSO page. For example, you could run <tt  >cat
/proc/self/maps</tt>.
</p><p>
Note that running this command multiple times produces different address
ranges for <tt  >[vdso]</tt> thanks to (if your kernel supports
it) address space layout
randomization.
</p><p>
The output should look something similar to:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
7fff40d71000-7fff40d72000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vdso]
...
</pre>
</p><p>
The above range is showing for the <tt  >cat</tt> process you just executed that the
address range for the vDSO page is located starting at
<tt  >7fff40d71000</tt> and ending
at <tt  >7fff40d7200</tt>. Subtracting the start and end
range, you get 0x1000 or 4096
bytes. 4096 is the page size often used in the kernel. Listing 1 shows
code for extracting the vDSO from a running kernel, and it is based on code
from the &ldquo;Examining the Linux VDSO&rdquo; article listed in
Resources.
</p><p>
A simple dumping of the dynamic object symbols can be conducted via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
objdump -T vdso.so
</pre>
</p><p>
Because a shared library is also an elf, the <tt  >readelf</tt>
tool also can be used on
vdso.so.

Security Implication</h2></div></div><p>
Anytime you dabble with the kernel, you should consider the security
implications.
If you think you can &ldquo;own&rdquo; someone by creating your own vDSO calls, you might
want to think again. Because adding a vDSO requires users to bake their own
kernels, the only people they could be compromising is their system and the users
on their system. Of course, any dabbling with kernel resources should be done
with much consideration. Remember, playing with vDSO goodies occurs in
userland; however, your vDSOs can access kernel data. And, your kernel can read
vDSO data. That can be a concern, but I'll leave that up to you as an
exercise for finding anything exploitable.
</p><p>
Finally, this article is just a little one-two on how to cook up your own vDSO. Now go
make yourself a smoking kernel.
