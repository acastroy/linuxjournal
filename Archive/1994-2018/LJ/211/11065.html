Do you have a spindle of CDs, each of which with a live environment you use
for a specific purpose? Read this article to learn how to combine them all
into one unified boot environment on a USB drive.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1255250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's inevitable. If you work with Linux professionally, you will end up with
a bevy of CDs or USB drives, each with their own live environment, each
with a specific purpose. You likely have some haphazard system for keeping
track of which device has what on it (my personal method was masking tape
and pencil). But, there's no reason to keep doing this! Improvements in
bootloaders (particularly GRUB) let you have live,
persistent operating environments installed on USB drives as well as
allowing for multiboot environments. Put this all together, and you
get a single USB drive that replaces the gaggle of devices you used to
have.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1255408"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
GRUB</b></p><p>
GRUB, short for Grand Unified Bootloader, is the default bootloader for a
vast majority of Linux distributions. The bootloader is a tiny program
that is loaded into memory immediately when the computer is powered on that
knows how to load data from a nonvolatile source (HDD, USB drive, optical
device and so on) and, in turn, loads an operating system from the specified
device.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1255618"></a>
Setting Up GRUB on USB in Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to the Linux community's prolific use of GRUB as the default bootloader, installing GRUB to the Master Boot Record for a USB device is
incredibly easy. Assume that you want to call your new volume
&ldquo;Multipass&rdquo;
and that your target device resides at /dev/sdb1. First, you need to
create the filesystem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mkfs.vfat -n Multipass /dev/sdb1
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to mount the filesystem and install GRUB:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/
grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdb
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can add .cfg files to grub.d/ in order to add/edit/delete menu
items to the boot menu or customize the boot menu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1255988"></a>
Setting Up GRUB on USB in Windows</h2></div></div><p>
Installing GRUB on a USB device is markedly different in an environment
that doesn't natively have GRUB utilities, but it isn't impossible. Tools
like GRUB4DOS and WinGRUB are available that give you access to the same
tools in Windows that are available in Linux. Basically, you need
to find tools to initialize the drive as a bootable drive and install GRUB
to the device. PeToUSB, GRUB4DOS and grubinst are the most widely used set of
tools to accomplish this. PeToUSB uses a simple GUI interface to
initialize the USB device as a bootable device. grubinst is a GUI
installer that installs GRUB to the USB device. The only reason you need
to download GRUB4DOS is because you need to copy &ldquo;grldr&rdquo; to the USB device.
You can find more detailed instructions on how to use these tools on-line.
But, as Windows installations are outside the purview of this publication, I
digress.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1255ae8"></a>
Adding Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have GRUB set up, you need to add something to boot. Download
your favorite live CD or app CD, and extract it using something like the
GNOME Archive Manager. Do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> extract this to your
USB drive! Instead, extract it to a temporary location. Once you
have performed this procedure several times, you will notice that almost all
Linux distributions have a boot directory, and the files within this
directory are the kernel image and vary from distribution to distribution.
Then, rename the boot
directory to something apropos to the distribution (for instance,
&ldquo;boot-ubuntu&rdquo;), and copy it to the USB device. Aside from the boot folder,
there typically is another folder in these ISOs that contains the boot
image for the OS (for instance, BackTrack4's image is stored in a directory
called bt4). Copy this folder to the USB device as well. You then
need to add an entry in the configuration file so that this distribution
will show up in the boot menu.
</p><p>
This is where a major schism occurs, and a little more background
knowledge of GRUB is required. There are two versions of GRUB, initially
referred to as GRUB and GRUB2, they now are called GRUB Legacy and GRUB,
respectively (GRUB4DOS is a derivative of GRUB Legacy). There are a
significant number of differences between the two, but the one that is
important to us right now is that GRUB Legacy uses the menu.lst file for
boot menu configuration, and GRUB uses grub.cfg. So depending on the
source of the GRUB installation on your USB device, you will use a
different configuration file.

Some distributions are distributed as a floppy disk image. Those are the
best&mdash;all you have to do is copy the file to the root of the USB device
and add a one-line entry to the config file.
</p><p>
Even though this takes time, you're better off testing each distribution
after installing a new distribution. That way, if you find an error, it'll
be easier to troubleshoot the problem. Trust me, installations can
be finicky when you do things this way, and they can break for what seems like
no good reason.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1256068"></a>
Adding a Menu Item in grub.cfg</h2></div></div><p>
At its most common and basic form, each menu entry will provide:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A user-friendly title.
</p></li><li><p>
The root filesystem.
</p></li><li><p>
A kernel image.
</p></li><li><p>
A boot image or initial ramdisk.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
menuentry "Made Up Distro" { #user-friendly title
    set root=(hd0,1) #root filesystem
    linux /boot-madeup/vmlinuz0 #the kernel image
    initrd /madeup/initrd0.img #the boot image
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Some distributions take some tweaking to get them to load properly. For
instance, some live CDs need to be booted into 16-bit mode, and in that
case,
you would use <tt  >linux16</tt> and
<tt  >initrd16</tt> instead. You can look in the GRUB
manual on-line for all sorts of boot parameters and tweaks you can use on
the menu item to make it work, but your best resource is the grub.cfg that
was on the original ISO for the distribution. Some entries can become
ridiculously complex in order to work right, like for Fedora:


<pre     class="programlisting">
linux /fedora1/isolinux/vmlinuz0 live_locale=en_US.UTF-8
&#8618;live_keytable=us live_dir=/fedora1 root=UUID=A716-9810 
&#8618;rootfstype=auto ro liveimg quiet rhgb 
&#8618;rd_NO_LUKS rd_NO_MD noiswmd
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the actual kernel image command from my own multipass device. It
is long and tedious, but it works.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1256748"></a>
Adding a Menu Item to menu.lst</h2></div></div><p>
The menu.lst file, with regard to menu items, is quite similar to the
grub.cfg entries. You still specify the user-friendly title, the root
filesystem, and the kernel and boot images, but the syntax is a little
different. An entry in menu.lst would look something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title Made Up Distro
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot-madeup/vmlinuz0
initrd /madeup/initrd0.img
boot
</pre>
</p><p>
As with the grub.cfg entries, you can use many more commands than you can use in
menu.lst, and you can make a lot of tweaks to make a nonfunctional
entry suddenly work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1256900"></a>
ISO Loopback</h2></div></div><p>
It all seems pretty daunting, no? Don't you wish there were a way to 
dump all your ISO files onto one disk and then mount them all? Your wish
is granted! With GRUB2, we were introduced to the
loopback boot option. This allows you to use GRUB to mount an ISO file and
boot from it as if it were a physical piece of media. All you have to do
for the menu entries is add a <tt  >loopback</tt> command and then adjust
the <tt  >linux</tt> and <tt  >initrd</tt> commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
menuentry "Made Up Distro" { #user-friendly title
    set root=(hd0,1) #root filesystem
    loopback loop "/madeup.iso"
    linux (loop)/boot/vmlinuz0 #the kernel image
    initrd (loop)/initrd0.img #the boot image
}
</pre>
</p><p>
GRUB then mounts the ISO file and boots accordingly. Note that you
still may need to add some arguments to either command to get it
to boot properly. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for all ISO files. If
you can't get the loopback to work for an ISO, you have to load it the
old-fashioned way as described above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1256c18"></a>
Customizing the Boot Menu</h2></div></div><p>
What good would a fancy tool like this be if you couldn't customize it to
your liking? The default boot menu is white text on black background, which,
let's face it, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>boring</em></span>. In your config file, you can specify a
background image or color, text color, highlight color, alternate text for
your menu entries, and the list goes on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1561b38"></a>
Set the Background Image</h2></div></div><p>
First, if you are using GRUB4DOS, the background picture has to be
converted to 640x480 and 14-color, so you need to make sure that whatever
you're using will look good under those constraints. GRUB2 has a bit
more-advanced rendering capability, and it can handle JPG-, TGA- and PNG-formatted
pictures as long as they are in RGB mode and not indexed mode.
</p><p>
The basic process for doing this is to scale and crop the image to your
liking, limit the number of colors in the image palette to 14, save the
image as an xpm file, and gzip it. For a more in-depth explanation of this
process, I will use GIMP, although there are a number of other ways to do
this.
</p><p>
After opening the image in GIMP, use a combination of scaling the image
(Image&rarr;Scale Image) and the crop tool to make the image 640x480. To
drop the number of palette colors in the image, click
Image&rarr;Mode&rarr;Indexed, and choose &ldquo;Generate optimum
palette&rdquo; with 14 colors. That's all
there is to it. You can do other things to the image to make
it look better in 14 colors:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Filters&rarr;Blur&rarr;Selective Gaussian Blur: this smooths out the image without losing detail.
</p></li><li><p>
Colors&rarr;Posterize: this turns subtle differences in color into a
large field of a single color. This is done smoothly, which makes the
image look better in 14 colors.
</p></li><li><p>
Colors&rarr;Levels&rarr;Auto: this increases the contrast of the image,
lessening the number of colors used in the image.
</p></li><li><p>
Colors&rarr;Map&rarr;Gradient Map: maps the existing colors in your image
into a gradient, essentially minimizing the colors used.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you've got your image the way you want it, save it as an XPM image
file, then gzip the XPM file. You'll end up with a file named something
like image.xpm.gz. Move this file to your USB device.
</p><p>
If you are running GRUB4DOS, look in menu.lst for a line something similar
to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
splashimage splash.xpm.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
If you find it, replace the splash.xpm.gz with the path and filename of
your file. Otherwise, add the line.
</p><p>
If you are running GRUB2, open grub.cfg and find a line that looks
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GRUB_BACKGROUND=splash.xpm.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
If it exists, replace the image name with the path and filename for your
image. Otherwise, add the line, then run:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
update-grub
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1562320"></a>
Set the Menu and Highlight Color</h2></div></div><p>
You also can adjust the color of the menu text itself. You can adjust two
separate values: the normal color (consisting of most of the
text and the menu border) and the highlight color (the colors for the item
currently selected in the menu list). Each of these values consists of two
colors: the foreground and the background. Colors you can choose from
include black, dark-gray, light-gray, white, brown, yellow, red, light-red,
blue, light-blue, green, light-green, cyan, light-cyan, magenta and
light-magenta. If black is chosen as the background color, it will show as
transparent.
</p><p>
The command to adjust the colors in menu.lst for GRUB4DOS is
<tt  >color</tt>,
followed by the normal color and then the highlight color. Specify the
foreground and background colors by using a forward slash. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
color white/black white/blue
</pre>
</p><p>
The above signifies white text on a transparent background, and the highlighted text
is white on a blue background.
</p><p>
GRUB2 uses two variables in grub.cfg to accomplish the same thing. These
variables are <tt  >COLOR_NORMAL</tt> and
<tt  >COLOR_HIGHLIGHT</tt>. Again, use the forward
slash to separate foreground color from background color:

<pre     class="programlisting">
COLOR_NORMAL="white/black"
COLOR_HIGHLIGHT="white/blue"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x15626e8"></a>
Change the Text Font</h2></div></div><p>
As far as I've been able to discern, you can change the font used in
the menu only if you are using GRUB2. To accomplish this, you need to utilize
one of the many nifty tools that come with grub:
<tt  >grub-mkfont</tt>. Assuming
you already have the font and you know where the font file resides,
you simply need to run <tt  >grub-mkfont</tt>, and specify the location of the font file,
the destination for the grub font file and the size you want the text to be
in points. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo grub-mkfont --output=/path/to/usb_device/comicsans.pf2 --size=14
/usr/share/fonts/comicsans.ttf
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, in your grub.cfg file, add the variable GRUB_FONT and set it to the
path and name of the grub font file you just created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GRUB_FONT=/path/to/usb_device/comicsans.pf2
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115d580.0x1562a00"></a>
Applications to Automate the Process</h2></div></div><p>
Take everything I've taught you up to this point and throw it out the
window! There are a number of different applications for all the major
operating systems that easily will replicate the previously outlined
procedure with little to no fuss. YUMI and SARDU are the top picks for
generating a multipass in Windows, and MultiSystem is the tool of choice in
Linux. Each of these applications has a handy GUI that walks you through
adding all the images you want and customizing the menu to your heart's
content.
</p><p>
I was first introduced to the concept of a multiboot USB device several
years ago when the only way to set it up was manually with a lot of
guessing
and checking. I don't mind telling you, it was a royal pain to get anything
working, let alone be elegant. As time goes by, utilities to help you set them
up have emerged, and they've gotten better. What took me several hours to
set up two
years ago, took me only about 15 minutes this time around (and that includes
the time to download the ISOs).
