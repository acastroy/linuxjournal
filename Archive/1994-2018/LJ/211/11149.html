Protecode System 4</h2></div></div><p>
The most noteworthy enhancement in the upgraded Protecode System 4,
Protecode Inc.'s open-source license management solution, is full
support for the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) standard. Sponsored
by the Linux Foundation, SPDX is an effort to create a standard format for
communicating the components, licenses and copyrights associated with a
software package. Protecode says that System 4's ability to read and
generate SPDX information eases license information exchange across the
software supply chain and allows for a simpler license compliance process.
System 4 now also includes Code Administrator, an application that
facilitates requesting, analysis and approval of open-source and other
third-party software within an organization. It ensures that only a well-understood, preapproved set of software packages of specific versions with
defined use cases are deployed.

Nimbula Director</h2></div></div><p>
Nimbula has unveiled the new version 1.5 of Nimbula Director, which the
company says is the first cloud operating system that's capable of
supporting a geographically distributed cloud. Nimbula Director helps
enterprises and service providers build powerful private, hybrid and public
cloud infrastructures. Nimbula Director abstracts the underlying technology
to present a coherent view of a completely automated compute and storage
cloud. This one-stop virtual data-center management solution isolates
customers from the operational and hardware complexity associated with
deploying a private or public cloud. The software can manage many
geographic locations of a multi-site cloud from a single view, which allows
end users to access any resource worldwide and deploy their workloads to
any site in a self-service manner with a single login.

Akiri Solutions' DevBox-EZ</h2></div></div><p>
Cheap is good, but free is better, and the latter is what you'll pay for
Akiri Solutions' DevBox-EZ, a new virtual appliance that offers all the
tools necessary for implementing software development projects as well as
simplifying and accelerating the migration to Git. The free version is
modeled on Akiri's popular DevBox solution. DevBox-EZ, says its developer,
&ldquo;is up and running within just a few minutes and provides shared Git
repositories, bug tracking, automated backup, file sharing and
project-based built-in wikis&rdquo;. Integrated bug and issue tracking
eliminates the need for the hassle of a separate tool. The automated backup
can be scheduled at any time with a click of the mouse, and project-based
built-in wikis that help ensure important project knowledge can be 
captured easily. The file-sharing capability simplifies the painstaking process of
adding or deleting users and managing permissions versus using FTP sites or
shared file servers.

Samba</h2></div></div><p>
Messrs. Tridgell, Allison and the rest of the dedicated Samba team have
been forging ahead with a slew of new features and functionality,
culminating in a recent major new version 3.6 release. Samba, of course, is
the famed Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and UNIX.
Most notable in Samba 3.6 is the first free software implementation of
Microsoft's new SMB2 file-serving protocol. The brand-new asynchronous
server architecture allows Samba's new SMB2 server to double the
performance of some network applications when run with Microsoft Windows 7
clients. In addition, the print subsystem has been rewritten completely to
use automatically generated remote procedure calls and provides greater
compatibility with the Windows SPOOLSS print subsystem architecture. Other
features include improved clustered file server support, simplified
identity mapping and greater reliability, among others.

Steve Parker's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shell Scripting: Expert Recipes for Linux, Bash,
and More</em></span> (Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
A Linux geek's reference shelf without a book on shell scripting is
painfully lonely. If your books are experiencing this loneliness, consider
picking up Steve Parker's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shell Scripting: Expert Recipes for
Linux, Bash, and More</em></span>. This Wrox title is billed as &ldquo;a compendium of
shell scripting recipes that can immediately be used, adjusted and
applied&rdquo;. With this book, Linux expert Steve Parker shares a collection
of shell scripting recipes that can be used &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo; or easily
modified for a variety of environments or situations to avoid re-inventing
the wheel. The book covers shell programming, with a focus on Linux and the
Bash shell; it provides credible, real-world relevance, as well as
including the flexible tools to get started immediately.

Lipson Robotics' Robot Sculptures</h2></div></div><p>
All right geeks, let's drop everything and talk Christmas presents! Have you
dropped any gift hints yet? Good, because good things (sometimes) come to
those who procrastinate. We suggest requesting the gift of art,
specifically art that a computer nerd can love and appreciate. We recently
stumbled upon the whimsical robot sculptures from New York City artist
David Lipson. Lipson assembles these one-of-a-kind robots from random new
and old objects. All are inspired by Lipson's love of tin toy robots,
sci-fi movies and retro design. Each artwork is sold exclusively at
Animazing Gallery in New York City, as well as via the gallery's Web site.

BlackSky Computing's Apollo Enterprise HPC Storage System</h2></div></div><p>
It's easy being green with BlackSky Computing's Apollo Enterprise HPC
Storage System, a massively scalable storage architecture that packs 180TB
in a 4U chassis while maintaining a light footprint. Apollo can be expanded
to support a single filesystem of more than 2 Petabytes &ldquo;with no
degradation in performance&rdquo;, says BlackSky, and it can work with HPC data
sets up to 80Gb/s, making the system reportedly &ldquo;four times faster
the I/O and one-fourth the price of the leading competitors&rdquo;. BlackSky
built Apollo because all others failed its own internal needs, which
include the following requirements: tremendous capacity at low-price/TB,
proportional network bandwidth in and out of the device that will cripple
HPC applications if not done correctly and expandability under one filesystem to very large volumes. Other features include full redundancy and a
Web-based UI.

Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Malware
Analysis</em></span> (No
Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Get smart and ward off malware by thoroughly understanding it and those who
make it by reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to
Dissecting Malicious Software</em></span>. The new book, authored by Michael
Sikorski and Andrew Honig and published by No Starch Press, provides a
rapid introduction to the tools and methods used to dissect malicious
software, showing how to analyze, debug and disassemble these
threats safely. The book goes on to examine how to overcome the evasive
techniques&mdash;stealth, code obfuscation, anti-debugging, encryption,
packing and others&mdash;that malware authors employ to thwart analysis
attempts. Key chapters include a lab at the end, which reviews important
concepts from the discussion in the context of real-world malware examples.
Both beginners and veterans alike will find the book useful.
