    For those not familiar with Usenix, it has been the &ldquo;wear a tie
    and get laughed at&rdquo; Unix show for years.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd8298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here I am at Usenix at the Mariott Hotel
in Anaheim. Actually, it is pleasant to be in nice weather after
almost drowning in Seattle. It had rained here the day before so
the air was actually clean. But, let me talk about the show instead
of the weather.
</p><p>Usenix is a five-day show that, this year, has a heavy Linux
presence. For those not familiar with Usenix, it has been the
&ldquo;wear a tie and get laughed at&rdquo; Unix show for years. It is
technical and tends to draw a very seriously technical
crowd.</p><p>It is broken up into tutorials, a trade show and a technical
conference. Well, plus the informal beer drinking sessions and
such.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd8450"></a>Tutorial Days</h2></div></div><p>The first two days are tutorials and I elected to attend an
all-day tutorial on the Linux 2.0 kernel presented by Stephen
Tweedie. I found it to be excellent and that seemed to be the
general opinion of the approximately 125 people who
attended.</p><p>In eight hours and 170 overheads, Stephen addressed four
specific areas of the kernel: memory management, the scheduler,
filesystems and I/O and networking. I feel the goal of the talk,
&ldquo;to be with the design and algorithms behind the Linux kernel and
to be able to read the Linux source code with some understanding&rdquo;
was met. While Stephen did not necessarily expect attendees to be
familiar with Unix systems programming, the more you knew about
Unix the easier it was to understand the presentation. After all,
learning everything about a new operating system in eight hours is
quite a challenge.</p><p>On Tuesday, Ted T'so gave a tutorial on writing device
drivers under Linux. This talk was attended by about 60 students. I
elected to take Tuesday as a day to catch up on
<i  >LJ</i> work and make a run to Fry's Electronics to
see if they carry <i  >Linux Journal</i>. They
don't&mdash;which makes no sense as Fry's is exactly the kind of place a
Linux geek would want to go.</p><p>Tuesday evening started with free food and drink. This is one
of the best ways to get geeks talking. The Marriott did a great job
with an array of food carts with various choices including fruit,
veggies, potato patties, nachos, hamburgers and hot dogs. There
were also drink and dessert carts. They even had my drug of choice,
Dr. Pepper.</p><p>There were Birds-of-a-Feather sessions scheduled from 6PM to
10PM. The two Linux ones were scheduled at the same time, both at
7PM. As I already know a lot about Caldera Linux I elected to go to
the talk on Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Peter Collins,
manager of software services for Exemplar Logic, headed the BoF and
talked about how his company had done an NT port but now had a
Linux port. He pointed out that EDA grew up on Unix-based systems
like Suns and the capabilities of Linux were a better fit for
current EDA users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd8768"></a>The Trade Show</h2></div></div><p>The trade show started on Wednesday. While this was not a
Linux-specific trade show, Linux had a large presence. Linux
vendors included Caldera, EST (makers of the BRU backup utility),
InfoMagic, Linux International, Red Hat, Walnut Creek CDROM,
WorkGroup Solutions and Yggdrasil. Plus, of course, our booth where
we were giving away sample copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Lots of other vendors came by to talk about
Linux and the Linux products they sell.</p><p>Linux interest was very high. While Usenix is a geek
conference, these are mostly professional geeks who are making
serious technical decisions for real companies. I answered many
&ldquo;It seems like Linux could do this&rdquo; inquiries.</p><p>Within the trade show I think SSC offered the biggest hit. We
just finished our new &ldquo;fences&rdquo; T-shirt. We sold out of the shirts
in about four hours on the first day. This gave me the feeling that
I was at the right show&mdash;not one where Microsoft was being
honored.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd8978"></a>Linus Talks and Linux Talks</h2></div></div><p>On Wednesday afternoon we proved how significant the Linux
interest/presence was. Linus was scheduled to talk on the future of
Linux in a fairly large room, which soon filled up, with standees
everywhere&mdash;including the hall outside. Usenix quickly offered to
move the crowd into a much larger hall.</p><p>The talk went well as Linus explained new features and new
ideas. I won't bore you with details. The important thing is that
the goal is world domination. To some this sounded like humor.
Maybe it was. Only time will tell. In the meantime, building a
superior product can't hurt.</p><p>Wednesday evening was a time for more Linux sessions. I
attended one called <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Classroom of the
Future</em></span> that showed how an experimental program brought
the Internet to K-12 schools in Ireland. I also attended another
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future of the Linux Desktop</em></span>,
missing Greg Wettstein's talk on perceptions. [see Greg's article
&ldquo;Linux in the Trenches&rdquo; in <i  >LJ</i> #5, September
1994&mdash;Ed.]</p><p>Thursday was another day of talks and trade show. Peter
Struijk, SSC's &ldquo;head nerd&rdquo; managed to make it to Victor
Yodaiken's presentation on real-time Linux [see
<i  >LJ</i> #34, February 1997] and a talk on the /proc
file system by Stephen Tweedie. In the evening, I hosted a session
on embedded, turnkey and real-time systems and intended to make it
to Developing Linux-based electronic markets for Internet Trading
Experiments but ended up talking with some of the attendees of my
session instead.</p><p>The evening ended with a short talk about Linux and reality
with Stephen Tweedie and then a trip back to the hotel room to
finish up this column. Then, if I run out of things to do I may
actually get some sleep.</p><p>Friday offered a day of Uselinux business talks. However, the
combination of editorial deadlines and exhaustion means you won't
get to read about it here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd8d98"></a>What Next?</h2></div></div><p>It was a great show. Usenix has always been a great show
offering high-quality sessions and a really nice mix of
&ldquo;non-suites&rdquo;. Having Usenix/Uselinux made it all the better. I am
sure there will be serious cooperation between Usenix and Linux
International to continue to making Linux a big part of
Usenix.</p><p>If I have one complaint it was that there was too much to do.
Add a Linux International board meeting to a schedule that included
sessions, talks and BoFs from 9AM to 11PM with parallel Linux
tracks plus the normal Usenix tracks and there just wasn't time to
breathe or, more importantly, sit down with a beer and talk to
fellow kernel hackers, systems administrators or vendors.</p><p>Anyone who wants copies of the Proceedings of this
conference, or to find out what the future holds with regard to
Usenix, should contact USENIX Association at office@usenix.org,
check out their web site at http://www.usenix.org or, if all else
fails, call 510-528-8649. Oh, and if you don't know what 8649
spells, you must be new to the Unix community.</p></div></div>
