On-Line Book</b></span></a></p><p>Applixware is is an excellent &ldquo;office suite&rdquo; that may open
doors to wider use of Linux.</p><p><a href="0202f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Applix
Words</b></span></a></p><p>Applixware features a word processor, a spreadsheet, a
presentation graphics tool, a drawing tool, an e-mail client,
database connectivity and an object-oriented application builder.
For some time, this professional set of programs has been available
for other Unix platforms, including HP-UX, Solaris, AIX and Digital
Unix, and now Applixware is available for Intel-compatible Linux
machines and Microsoft Windows; at the time of this writing, the NT
version is out and the 95 version is in beta testing.</p><p>If you install Applixware on your system, you'll notice an
impact on system resources. A complete installation with the
included Red Hat RPM files requires 210MB&mdash;if that's more than you
have available, you can make a partial installation from a live,
&ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; directory on the CD-ROM. In fact, Applixware can be
launched and used directly from the CD-ROM, though this makes
program operation a little leisurely. I was using Red Hat Linux 4.0
when I reviewed Applixware, but the software should work fine on
other distributions, and installation instructions are
included.</p><p>The CD speed may not seem bad if you're using a 486DX25, on
which Applixware is fast enough to be usable, but probably too slow
for a production environment; I found my meager CPU power to be a
real problem only when I started using the graphics tools.</p><p>This is not an application for low-memory systems. As cheap
as RAM is today, this shouldn't be too painful a state to rectify.
With 16MB of RAM, the word processor was snappy enough with X and
the Afterstep window manager running, but having much else loaded
caused so much paging of virtual memory I needed something to read
while waiting.</p><p>Not much reading material comes with Applix&mdash;at least, not on
paper. Back when it was known as Asterix and also in version 3.x of
Applix, there was a manual for each module, but either with the
Linux version or with the later releases, virtually all
documentation is in the &ldquo;On-Line Books&rdquo;. Use the on-line
tutorials if you're new to the system, or the on-line help if you
just need a reference.</p><p><a href="0202f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Applix
Graphics</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix Words</em></span> is a full-featured word
processor with everything you'd expect to find in a modern product.
That is, unless you're looking to do something which really should
be done using desktop publishing software. By the way, one thing
you never want to do with it is embed, oh, 80 or so large,
256-color GIFs in a single document&mdash;at somewhere around 8MB,
application behavior gets a bit wacky. Linking is much, much
better.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Words</em></span> gives you tables, borders,
shading, embedded equations and calculations, conditional text and
cross-referencing, international dictionaries, thesauri and a
multi-font, multi-size WYSIWYG display. You can rely on multiple
undo and redo, and when you're done, you can save PostScript and
PCL printer files or send them directly to a networked
printer.</p><p>HTML is easy with the Applix HTML authoring tool. Documents
can be imported from Applix or another popular word processor using
one of the format filters or created from scratch with the same
ease as a word processing document. Clip art, GIFs and linked or
embedded Applix Graphics images are converted seamlessly.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix Spreadsheets</em></span> documents and queries from
the database interface application, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data</em></span>, can
be included, too. Tables, colors, and more than 25 standard HTML
styles are all under your control.</p><p><a href="0202f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Applix
Builder</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix Graphics</em></span> is a terrific drawing
and presentation graphics tool. At your disposal are user-definable
fill patterns, various brush styles, shearing, drop shadows,
incremental zoom, rotating, scaling, color pixel editing and text
wrapping, to name a few. Grid snap, guide lines, rulers, and
coordinates help create precise and complex drawings quickly. I
found graphics as easy to produce with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Graphics</em></span> as with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Powerpoint</em></span>.</p><p>The good news continues with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix
Spreadsheets</em></span> with calculation-based attributes, 3D
charts, named views and dynamic links to objects in other
Applixware applications. When your linked data from elsewhere
changes, it is automatically updated in your spreadsheet. There are
live links to a relational database through <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix
Data</em></span>, goal seeking, drag-and-drop, projection tables and
background recalculation. You can import those old Lotus 1-2-3 and
Excel spreadsheets, too.</p><p>You might not think you need another mail client, but check
out <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix Mail</em></span>. When you receive mail, a
dialog box pops up with the sender name and subject, giving you the
options &ldquo;Read Now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Read Later&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Help&rdquo;. You can attach
Applix files to your mail messages and upon receipt, launch the
appropriate Applix tool for viewing. Mail can be marked &ldquo;Urgent&rdquo;,
marked with a &ldquo;Reply by&rdquo; date, and also sent by &ldquo;certified&rdquo;
mail, giving you a receipt when the recipient has read the mail. Of
course you can &ldquo;Cc&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bcc&rdquo; people. You also get shared mail
folders, automatic conversion of messages and documents to your
preferences, encryption, and mail filtering based on rules you
specify.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Applix Data</em></span> connects Applixware
applications to SQL databases like Informix, Oracle, Ingres, and
Sybase, seamlessly querying data from one or more tables, selecting
information with query conditions, and performing advanced queries
and joins. Rows can be edited, inserted, and deleted. A live link
in your document to the database means up-to-date data.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Data</em></span> provides a lot of capability when teamed
with ELF and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Builder</em></span>.</p><p>The Extension Language Facility (ELF) is an interpreted
language with which users can build and deploy applications,
front-ends to applications, automate tasks and connect to databases
and other external sources of data. The Applix user interfaces are
built with ELF and ELF macros can be used to automate tasks in any
of the Applixware applications. Some capabilities include: TCP/IP
socket interfacing, remote procedure calls, interactive debugging,
many built-in macros, string manipulation, and arithmetic and
Boolean operators.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Builder</em></span> is object oriented and gives you
access to external data sources as well as the capabilities of the
Applixware application suite for use in your custom applications.
Also, full access to ELF macros and functions, external objects,
shared classes, RPC and shared library support. Plus, the
applications you develop in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Builder</em></span> on one
platform are portable to Applixware on other platforms without
modification.</p><p>Applixware is a terrific package. When I heard it was
available for Linux, I knew I could let go of Microsoft Office (and
MS Windows) forever.</p></div></div>
