    Having trouble connecting to the Internet? Here's an easy way to
    do it using PPP.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x29b0500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Connecting your Linux machine to the
Internet with PPP is easy in most situations. In this article I
show you how to configure PPP for the most common type of
connection. We assume your Linux machine is a stand-alone machine
that dials into an Internet Service Provider and performs an
automatic login, and the Internet Service Provider allocates the IP
address that your machine will use. You can find details of how to
configure PPP for other situations in the PPP-HOWTO by Robert Hart.
You will need the right software and a couple of pieces of
information before you start. Let's get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x29b0608"></a>Preparation</h2></div></div><p>First, check that you have the right software. The program
that manages PPP for Linux is called
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>. The pppd program is linked
very tightly with the kernel, so you must run a version of pppd
that matches your kernel.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Kernel Version    pppd version
1.2.*             2.1.2d
1.3.0 -&gt; 1.3.84   2.1.2d
1.3.84 -&gt; 1.3.99  2.2.0f
2.0.*             2.2.0f
2.1.*             2.2.0f
</pre><p>Check the version of pppd and kernel that you have installed
with the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/sbin/pppd version
$ uname -a
</pre>


The first command is a trick. The pppd command doesn't actually
have a version option. However, the version number will appear in
the error message pppd returns, since you have supplied it with a
bad argument.
</p><p>If the first command fails, you probably don't have PPP
installed. You can obtain the latest version of the source
from:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/ppp/
</pre><p>If you have installed from a distribution such as Debian, Red
Hat or Slackware, the pppd program is available precompiled within
those distributions. You just have to get the package and install
it.
</p><p>Next you must check that your kernel has PPP support. Do this
by giving the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ dmesg | grep -i ppp
</pre><p>You should see the following messages:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PPP: version 2.2.0 (dynamic channel allocation)
PPP Dynamic channel allocation code copyright 1995 Caldera, Inc.
PPP line discipline registered.
</pre>


If not, PPP may have been installed as a module. Become root and
try:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# insmod ppp
</pre>


If that fails, you will have to rebuild your kernel with PPP
support. Follow the instructions in /usr/src/linux/README, and when
configuring your kernel ensure that you answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
General setup  ---&gt;
        [*] Networking support
Network device support  ---&gt;
        [*] Network device support
        &lt;*&gt; PPP (point-to-point) support
</pre>


These prompts may be different in non-2.0 kernels.
</p><p>Next you must note what keystrokes you will send and what
prompts you will receive to log in to your ISP. The best way to
collect these is to try manually logging into your ISP using a
terminal program such as minicom. Be sure to make note of the
capitalization of prompts such as the &ldquo;login:&rdquo; prompt as this
will be important later.</p><p>A typical scenario follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Expect      Send                 Comment
------      ----                 -------
nothing     AT&amp;F/r               (mode reset)
OK          AT&amp;D2&amp;C1/r           (mode initialization)
OK          AT&amp;D555-9999/r       (modem dialing command)
</pre><p>The modem dials, sends CONNECT message and then you enter
userid and password as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
login:  username/r
password: password/r
</pre><p>Lastly, you must know the IP address of a nameserver so that
you can configure your name resolver and use host names instead of
IP addresses. Get this information from your ISP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x29b0d98"></a>Configuring PPP</h2></div></div><p>The pppd program can accept configuration parameters from two
places. The first is from the command line, and the second is from
&ldquo;options&rdquo; files. The arguments supplied are close to identical in
either case, but the command line method can be messy. So I will
describe how to configure PPP using the options files
instead.</p><p>The normal location of the options file is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/ppp/options
</pre><p>The options file is a simple text file containing parameters
pppd will use when it is executed&mdash;one parameter per line. The
options file must be readable by whoever will execute the pppd
program. In most installations this will be root, either directly
or by executing pppd from a program like sudo.
</p><p>If you don't have an <b  >/etc/ppp</b> directory,
as root create one using the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /etc/ppp
# chown root:root /etc/ppp
# chmod 755 /etc/ppp
</pre><p>Create an <b  >/etc/ppp/options</b> file that looks
like the following example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
debug
/dev/ttyS0
38400
modem
crtscts
lock
connect /etc/ppp/net-connect
asyncmap 0
defaultroute
:
</pre>


This example assumes:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>You want PPP to give you diagnostic information as
it runs.</p></li><li><p>Your modem is connected to serial device
/dev/ttyS0.</p></li><li><p>You want the serial port speed to be set at 38400
bps.</p></li><li><p>You want to listen to the Data Carrier Detect
signal.</p></li><li><p>You will use hardware (RTS/CTS) handshaking.</p></li><li><p>Your dialer program is /etc/ppp/net-connect.</p></li><li><p>You have a full 8 bit clean connection.</p></li><li><p>By default datagrams should be sent via the PPP
link.</p></li><li><p>You want the PPP server that you call to assign the
IP address you will use.</p></li></ol></div>

</p><p>These are all fairly typical defaults for an ISP connection.
You will have to adjust the serial device to suit where you have
your modem connected and, if you are using data compression, you
might want to set your serial port speed to something higher. PPP
provides a means of <span   class="emphasis"><em>escaping</em></span> select
characters, so that they do not interfere with your connection. For
example, if you were running PPP over a link that would disconnect
if it received a control-D character, you could ask PPP to escape
that character, and it would automatically replace it with another
and reverse the process at the other end. While the default is
safe, it escapes a number of characters that normally don't need
escaping and this will decrease the performance of your link. Since
most ISPs provide 8 bit clean links you don't need to escape any
characters, so we tell pppd not to, using the asyncmap
option.</p><p>The pppd package includes a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span>. The chat program is a simple
program that can be used to automate the dialing procedure. The
chat program also accepts arguments from the command line or from a
file. Again I'll describe how to configure it from a file as this
is the better method.</p><p>To make use of the chat program from within pppd, we must
ensure that the <b  >connect</b> option points to a
script that calls chat. Create a script called
<b  >/etc/ppp/net-connect</b> that looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/chat -v -t 60 -f /etc/ppp/net-chat
</pre><p>This shell script will invoke the chat command with the
<b  >-v</b>, <b  >-t</b> and
<b  >-f</b> arguments. The <b  >-v</b> argument
is useful when you are configuring pppd, as it sends verbose
diagnostic messages to the system log to show you what is happening
as the chat program runs. The <b  >-t 60</b> argument
simply tells the chat program to wait 60 seconds for the expected
text to arrive before timing out with an error. The
<b  >-f</b> argument tells chat the name of the file it
should use to get the expect/send sequences it will use to login.
</p><p>Make sure the script is readable and executable by whoever
will invoke pppd. Assuming again that &ldquo;whoever&rdquo; is
<b  >root</b>, use the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# chmod 500 /etc/ppp/net-connect
# chown root:root /etc/ppp/net-connect
</pre><p>Create a chat script called
<b  >/etc/ppp/net-chat</b> that will automate the login
sequence as described earlier. I will base this script on the
details presented in the table.
<pre     class="programlisting">
ABORT "BUSY"
ABORT "NO CARRIER"
""            AT&amp;F\r
OK              AT&amp;D2&amp;C1\r
OK              ATD555-9999\r
ogin:
sword:
</pre>


The first two lines are special. The <b  >ABORT</b>
keyword is a special token that allows you to specify strings of
characters that will cause the chat program to exit. In the example
presented, if the chat program receives either the string
<b  >"BUSY"</b> or the string <b  >"NO
CARRIER"</b> then it will abort immediately. The rest of the
file is a simple list of expect/send pairs, based on the
information we gathered when we manually logged in. The above
example reads in full:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>ABORT the script if we receive
<b  >"BUSY"</b> or <b  >"NO CARRIER"</b>.
Expect nothing, then send <b  >AT&amp;F&lt;
carriage-return&gt;</b> to reset the modem to factory
configuration, expect to receive <b  >OK</b> then send
<b  >AT&amp;D2&amp;C1&lt;carriage-return&gt;</b>, then
expect <b  >OK</b> and send
<b  >ATD555-9999&lt;carriage-return&gt;</b>, then expect
<b  >login:</b> and send
<b  >username&lt;carriage-return&gt;</b>, then expect
<b  >sword:</b> and send
<b  >password&lt;carriage-return&gt;</b>, and then exit
normally.</p></blockquote></div>

There are a couple of important points to note in this example.
First, the modem initialization string I've suggested will, in most
modems, ensure that the modem will raise the Data Carrier Detect
line when a call is connected, and will hang up the call if the DTR
line is lowered. This ensures that the modem is matched with the
<b  >modem</b> option supplied to pppd. Second, I haven't
used the full prompt, but only the last few characters. This is
generally good practice because under some circumstances the first
characters from a line may be dropped. Looking only for the last
few characters ensures our login succeeds even if this occurs.
Finally, you will notice the &lt;carriage-return&gt; is coded as
<b  >\r</b>. There are a range of other characters may be
encoded and sent in this way, if necessary. The chat man page
explains what they are should you need to use them.
</p><p>Finally, we must ensure this script is readable by whoever
will invoke pppd. Again assuming that whoever is be
<b  >root</b>, you can use the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# chown root:root /etc/ppp/net-chat
# chmod 600 /etc/ppp/net-chat
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2daa900"></a>Configuring the Name Resolver</h2></div></div><p>The name resolver is a small piece of software within the
standard Linux library that allows automatic conversion of a host
name, e.g., sunsite.unc.edu, into an IP address, e.g.,
152.2.254.81.</p><p>Configuration of the name resolver is easy; there is only one
file to change. You will almost certainly already have this file on
your machine, but you will need to configure the correct address
for the nameserver. Assuming your ISP supplied you with a
nameserver address of <b  >128.78.64.10</b> then your
<b  >/etc/resolv.conf</b> file should have a line that
says:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver 128.78.64.10
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2daab68"></a>Starting the Link</h2></div></div><p>To start the PPP link, all you need to do is execute the
following command as root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/sbin/pppd
</pre><p>The pppd program will start and will search for its options
in the standard locations. It will find our options file at
/etc/ppp/options and read each line. When it has finished
processing all available options, it will open the specified serial
device, create a lock file to prevent other programs from trying to
use it, and then attempt to run the connect program and to execute
the /etc/ppp/net-connect script. The net-connect script will
execute the chat program telling it that it should take its
parameters from the /etc/ppp/net-chat file. The chat program
starts, reads each of the lines from the net-chat file, waits for
the strings, and sends the responses it has been given. Provided
the chat program did not <b  >ABORT</b> then control is
passed back to the pppd program, which will then switch the line
into PPP mode and create a PPP network device. The pppd program
will automatically begin negotiation of some configuration details
with the PPP program at the other end of the link. The most
important of these details is the IP address you will use. The pppd
program will create a ppp network device <b  >ppp0</b>
and then configure it with the details it obtained from the other
program. Finally, the pppd program will configure your routing
table with a route that tells your Linux machine it should send
datagrams to the PPP link, if it doesn't have anywhere better to
send them. The pppd program will then sit happily in the background
until either the line fails, the remote end closes the connection
or you terminate it locally.
</p><p>Okay, that sounds complicated, so a summary:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>pppd starts.</p></li><li><p>pppd reads /etc/ppp/options.</p></li><li><p>pppd executes /etc/ppp/net-connect.</p></li><li><p>chat reads data from /etc/ppp/net-chat.</p></li><li><p>pppd obtains IP address details from server.</p></li><li><p>pppd creates ppp0 device and configures it.</p></li><li><p>pppd creates default route.</p></li><li><p>pppd runs in background.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2dab400"></a>Testing the Connection</h2></div></div><p>To test the connection, do each of the following steps in
turn.</p><p>Step 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
run /sbin/ifconfig
</pre><p>The ifconfig program is used to set or display network
interface configurations. Here you are interested in displaying
only.
</p><p>Step 2:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /sbin/ifconfig
</pre><p>The output should look like Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="2109l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The <b  >inet addr</b> field is the IP address you
have been allocated. The <b  >P-t-P</b> field is the
address of the PPP machine at the other end of the link. This means
your PPP network connection has been successfully
established.</p><p>If you don't see a <b  >ppp0</b> device, check your
system log file, i.e., /var/adm/messages, to ensure that your chat
script worked successfully. Correct any possible errors. If you see
any nasty looking error messages, double check that you are using
the correct version of PPP for your kernel.</p><p>Step 3: ping the PPP Remote Host. The ping command sends
specially formatted datagrams to a host that that host will send
replies to. This allows us to check that we have a working route to
that host. Listing 2 shows our case. Those &ldquo;<b  >64 bytes from
...</b>&rdquo; lines in the listing mean we are talking
successfully to the machine at the other end of the link. This is
good, since it means the link is working.</p><p><a href="2109l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>If you don't see any of the &ldquo;<b  >64 bytes from
...</b>&rdquo; lines, this means you are not properly talking to
the remote machine. Double check your chat script and the system
log file.</p><p>Step 4: ping your nameserver. This is an important test to be
sure the default route pppd put in place is working. To do this,
ping the nameserver address configured into the /etc/resolv.conf
file. In our case:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ping 128.78.64.10
</pre><p>Output will be similar to what you observed when you pinged
the PPP server.
</p><p><a href="2109l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>If this test fails, it could mean your default route hasn't
been added properly. To double check, run the route command as
shown in Listing 3. The route command displays the contents of the
IP routing table. The <b  >-n</b> option tells it not to
try and convert IP addresses into host names. The line starting
with <b  >0.0.0.0</b> is the default route. If you don't
see a line like this, double check that you have included the
<b  >defaultroute</b> option in the /etc/ppp/options
file. If you have a line like this but it doesn't point to ppp0,
check that your system isn't already creating a default route to
another device. If it is, find which
<span   class="bold"><b>rc</b></span> file is doing it and comment
out this entry.</p><p>Step 5: ping a remote host. This is the real and simple test.
Try either:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ping sunsite.unc.edu
</pre><p>or:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ftp ftp.funet.fi
</pre>


If this works, you are connected properly to the Internet. Enjoy.
</p><p>If the command just sits there and, after a minute or so,
gives you an error message about being unable to resolve the host
name, check that you have modified your /etc/resolv.conf file
correctly, and that the IP address you have configured there is the
correct IP address for your ISP's nameserver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2dac0b8"></a>Dropping a Connection</h2></div></div><p>To drop a connection you just need to kill pppd. When it
exits, it will hang up the line, if you've configured the modem as
I've suggested.</p><p>On most distributions this will be as simple as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# killall -HUP pppd
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2cbde50"></a>Making PPP Automatically Redial</h2></div></div><p>If you are lucky enough to have a semi-permanent connection
to your ISP, i.e., one where you can stay connected for as long as
you like, you may want to have your Linux automatically redial if
the telephone call drops out for some reason. Here is a simple way
of doing this that assumes you have configured your PPP link to be
activated by root.</p><p>The first very important step is to add this line to your
/etc/ppp/options file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-detach
</pre><p>This line tells pppd <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> to
go into the background after it has successfully connected. The
next step is to add a line to your /etc/inittab file that looks
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pd:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/pppd
</pre>


Put this line down with the other lines that are similiar to
it&mdash;the ones that run the login program.
</p><p>This line simply tells the init program that it should
automatically start the /usr/sbin/pppd program and that it should
automatically restart it if it dies. Provided you have your modem
configured to raise Data Carrier Detect and you have configured
pppd as I have described, <b  >init</b> will ensure the
pppd program is always running and re-run it if it
terminates.</p><p>A word of warning&mdash;this is simple, but provides no safeguards
against problems that might cause the telephone call to be
successfully made and then hang up. If you experience this problem,
the init program will quite happily keep re-running the pppd
program until you tell it to stop. You could run up quite a
telephone bill if something nasty goes wrong.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b8580.0x2cbe218"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This article describes a basic PPP configuration. There are
