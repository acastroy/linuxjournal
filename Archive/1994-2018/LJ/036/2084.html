    This article is a guide to building capable Linux workstations
    from cheap generic PC hardware.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227a348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most of the good things about Linux flow
from the fact that it makes a full-featured Unix accessible on
inexpensive hardware. Accordingly, there's a huge amount of
documentation and folk knowledge in the Linux community about how
to get people who already have cheap hardware to use Linux on it.
Up to now there hasn't been much advice available on how to acquire
cheap hardware that is well-matched to Linux, for someone who
already knows Linux.
</p><p>At today's prices, it's possible to put together a terrific
personal Unix platform for less than $2,000 US. If you're prepared
to go mail-order, shop carefully and make a few minor tradeoffs,
you can do it for $1,500 or even less. But beware. If you buy as
though for a DOS/Windows box, you won't get the best value or
performance. Linux works its hardware harder than Unix does, and
configurations that are marginal under DOS/Windows can cause
problems under Linux.</p><p>In this article, we'll develop a recipe for a cheap but
capable Linux workstation. While developing it, we'll discuss the
recipe choices in some detail, and see how to avoid common pitfalls
that can cause you grief.</p><p>We are going to stick to Intel hardware in this article.
Alphas are fast and have that wonderful 64-bit architecture, and
SPARCs too have earned their fans. However, I think PC hardware is
still overall the most cost-effective&mdash;cheapest to buy, easiest to
get serviced and best-tested with Linux. And, given the relative
sizes of the respective markets, PC hardware seems likely to hold
its lead for years yet.</p><p>For more detail on this subject, organized in a reference
rather than narrative format, surf to my PC-Clone UNIX Hardware
Buyer's Guide at
http://www.ccil.org/~esr/clone-hw-guide/contents.html. I've been
maintaining this document and its FAQ ancestor for longer than
Linux has existed, and have been running Unix on PC hardware since
shortly after it first became possible in the late 1980s.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227a5b0"></a>What To Optimize</h2></div></div><p>Most people think of the processor as the most important
choice in specifying any kind of personal-computer system. Our
first lesson in building Linux boxes is this: for Linux, the
processor type is nearly a red herring. It's far more important to
specify a capable system bus and disk I/O subsystem.</p><p>One important reason for this is precisely because PC systems
are marketed in a way that presents processor speed as a primary
figure of merit. The result is that the development of processor
technology has naturally gotten pushed harder than anything else,
and off-the-shelf PCs have processors that are quite overpowered
relative to the speed of everything else in the system. Your
typical PC these days has spare CPU-seconds it will never use,
because the screen, disk, modem and other peripherals can't be
driven fast enough to tax it.</p><p>If you're already running Linux, you may find it enlightening
to keep top(1) running for a while as you use your machine. Notice
how seldom the CPU idle percentage drops below 90%.</p><p>It's true that after people upgrade their motherboards, they
often report a throughput increase. But this is often due more to
other changes that go with the processor upgrade, such as improved
cache memory or an increase in the system bus's clocking speed,
i.e., enabling data to get in and out of the processor
faster.</p><p>The unbalanced, processor-heavy architecture of PCs is hard
to notice under DOS and Windows 3.1, because neither OS hits the
disk very much. But any OS that uses virtual memory and keeps lots
of on-disk logs and other transaction states is a different
matter&mdash;it will load the disk more heavily and will suffer more
from the imbalance.</p><p>Linux is in this category, and I'd guess Windows NT and OS/2
are too. Assuming you're buying for Linux on a fixed budget, it
makes sense to trade away some excess processor clocks to get a
faster bus and disk subsystem.</p><p>The truth is that <span   class="bold"><b>any</b></span> true
32-bit processor now on the market is more than fast enough for
your disks under a typical Linux-like load, even if it's a lowly
386/25. Your screen, if you're running X, can be a bit more
demanding&mdash;but even a 486/50 will let you drag Xterm windows around
like paper. And that's a lot slower than the cheapest new desktop
machine you'll be able to find by the time this article hits
paper.</p><p>So buy a fast bus. And especially, buy fast disks. How does
this translate into a recipe? Like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don't</b></span> bother with
the latest Pentium Pro whizbang 300mHz super-scorcher with a
cooling fan bigger than it is.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Do</b></span> get a PCI-bus
machine.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Do</b></span> get a SCSI
controller.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Do</b></span> get the fastest
SCSI disks you can afford.</p></li></ul></div><p>Buying PCI will get you maximum bus throughput, and makes
sense from several other angles as well. The doggy old ISA bus is
clearly headed for extinction at this point, and you don't hear
much about its other competitors (EISA, VESA local-bus video or
MCA) anymore. With PCI now being used in Macintoshes and Alphas as
well as all high-end Intel boxes, it's clearly here to stay, and a
good way to protect your investment in I/O cards from rapid
obsolescence.</p><p>The case for SCSI is a little less obvious, but is still
compelling. For starters, SCSI is still at least 10-15% faster than
EIDE running flat out. Furthermore, EIDE is still something of a
&ldquo;jerry-rig&rdquo;. Like Windows, it's layered over an ancestral design
(ST-512) that's antiquated and prone to failure under stress. SCSI,
on the other hand, was designed from the beginning to scale up well
to high-speed, high-throughput systems. Because it's perceived as a
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; choice, SCSI peripherals are generally better
engineered than EIDE equivalents. You'll pay a few dollars more,
but for Linux the cost is well repaid in increased throughput and
reliability.</p><p>For the fastest disks you can find, pay close attention to
seek and latency times. The former is an upper bound on the time
required to seek to any track; the latter is the maximum time
required for any sector on a track to come under the heads, and is
a function of the disk's rotation speed.</p><p>Of these, seek time is more important and is the one
manufacturers usually quote. When you're running Linux, a one
millisecond faster seek time can make a substantial difference in
system throughput. Back when PC processors were slow enough for the
comparison to be possible (and I was running System V Unix), it was
easily worth as much as a 30mHz increment in processor speed. Today
the corresponding figure would be higher.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227af50"></a>What Processor Should I Buy?</h2></div></div><p>We just got through with a lengthy explanation of why
processor speed isn't that important. But nobody is going to buy a
386/25 (or even 386/50) at this point; if nothing else, you want to
get a newer motherboard so you can put this week's flavor of RAM
module on it. And who knows? Maybe you
<span   class="bold"><b>will</b></span> end up doing real-time 3D
graphics or nuclear-explosion modeling or one of the handful of
applications that can really strain your processor.</p><p>So for all you processor-speed junkies out there who want to
be able to wave around megahertz figures like gearheads bragging
abut the compression ratios in their hot-rods, here's a simple
rule:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Do</b></span> buy one or two
levels lower than commercial state of the art.</p></li></ul></div><p>As of December 1996, if you look at a typical clone-maker's
advertisement, you'll see that the top three systems are a Pentium
Pro, a Pentium 166 and a Pentium 133. The rule of thumb tells us to
skip the Pentium Pro, consider the Pentium 166, and look seriously
at the 133.
</p><p>Why? Because of the way manufacturers' price-performance
curves are shaped. The top-of-line system is generally boob bait
for corporate executives and other people with more money than
sense. Chances are the system design is new and untried&mdash;if you're
at the wrong point in the technology cycle, the chip may even be a
pre-production sample, or an early production step with
undiscovered bugs, like the infamous Pentium FDIV problem. You
don't need such troubles. Better to go with a chip/motherboard
combination that's been out for a while and is well known. It's not
like you need the extra speed, after all.</p><p>Besides, if you buy one of these gold-plated systems, you're
only going to kick yourself three months later when the price
plunges by 30%. Further down the product line there's been more
real competition, and the manufacturer's margins are already
squeezed. There's less room for prices to fall, so you won't watch
your new toy lose street value so fast. Its price will still drop,
but it won't plummet sickeningly.</p><p>Again, bear in mind that the cheapest processor you can buy
new today is plenty fast enough for Linux. So if dropping back to a
Pentium 90 or 75 will bring you in under budget, you can do it with
no regrets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227b3c8"></a>One Disk or Two?</h2></div></div><p>At December 1996 prices, there's really no reason to consider
buying less than a 1-gigabyte disk. This is a convenient size,
because &ldquo;install everything&rdquo; on most Linux distributions will lay
out more than 540MB, but less than 1GB of stuff.</p><p>If you can afford 2GB, the natural thing to think about is
buying a 2GB disk instead. But personally, I like a configuration
with two 1GB disks better&mdash;one &ldquo;system&rdquo; disk and one &ldquo;home&rdquo;
disk. There are several good reasons for this kind of setup. Most
of them come down to the fact that you are quite a bit less likely
to trash two disks at once than you are to trash a single
one.</p><p>A lot of us do Linux upgrades every three months or so.
Wouldn't it give you a warm, comforting feeling during your next
one to be able to dismount your &ldquo;home&rdquo; disk in advance and
<span   class="bold"><b>know</b></span> that there's no way the
upgrade can possibly step on your personal files?</p><p>Or let's suppose you have a fatal disk crash. If you have
only one disk, goodbye Charlie. If you have two, maybe the crashed
one was your system disk, in which case you can buy another and
mess around with a new Linux installation knowing your personal
files are safe (see above). Or maybe it was your home disk; in that
case, you can still run and do recovery stuff and basic Net
communications until you can buy another home disk and restore it
from backups (you <span   class="bold"><b>did</b></span> keep
backups, right?).</p><p>You can even tune your disk configuration for performance
this way. SCSI controllers can interleave requests to different
disks, so your swapper and other system daemons will be able to use
scratch files on the system disk at the same time your applications
are using files on the home disk. Thus, you may find you actually
get faster throughput with two smaller disks than one big
one.</p><p>To get the most leverage from this effect, choose your system
disk for access speed and your home disk for capacity. In December
96 I would ideally choose a 1GB fast system disk and a 2GB home
disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227b738"></a>Monitor And Video</h2></div></div><p>First, buy your monitor. We won't go into detail about this
here because the issues aren't at all specific to Linux&mdash;you can
find good guidance in any DOS-related buyer's guide. There's not a
whole lot of price variance among functionally equivalent monitors,
since it's a mature commodity technology, so the basic question is,
&ldquo;how many square inches of screen can you afford?&rdquo;</p><p>This is one of the areas where pinching pennies is not a good
idea. You're going to be looking at your monitor for hours on end,
and using the screen real estate constantly. Buy the best quality,
largest screen you possibly can&mdash;it will be worth it. I personally
shelled out $2,000 for a 21-inch monitor in January 1996. Though I
have no regular income and this represented a significant portion
of my bank account, I have never regretted it.</p><p>The reasons not to pinch pennies are also reasons why you
should actually see the monitor you're contemplating before you buy
it. A factory flaw like serious edge mis-convergence or a tilted
yoke is not a happy thing to discover just after you've cut a
check.</p><p>You may want to consider looking for a repaired or
reconditioned monitor with a warranty. These are often as good as
new and much cheaper.</p><p>Next, buy your card. The major issue here is matching the
card to the capacity of your monitor&mdash;you don't want to pay for
more card than your screen can use, and you don't want to buy too
cheap a card and find it can't drive your monitor at its maximum
capability.</p><p>So once you've specified your monitor, find a video card with
a maximum video bandwidth equal to or just slightly higher than the
monitor's. That way you know your video system is properly balanced
with a minimum of wasted capacity.</p><p>There is a fair amount of price variance among equivalent
video cards, so shop aggressively here. If you're on a budget, one
easy thing to trade away is bit depth. Manufacturers like to
include 16- and 24-bit &ldquo;photographic&rdquo; color as sizzle in their
advertisements, but unless you're doing something like specialty
photocomposition work or medical graphics, you'll never use more
than 256. So you can settle for 8-bit color.</p><p>The days when XFree86 seriously constrained your choice of
video card are long past. Just about anything you can buy in a
clone system should work fine these days. If you're in doubt about
whether the card is supported, surf over to http://www.xfree86.org/
and check out their compatibility list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x227baa8"></a>Easier Choices</h2></div></div><p>Now we've got a good handle on the most important choices,
disks, bus, processor and video. The rest is easier, and less
dependent on the peculiarities of Linux.</p><p>Next in importance is your CD-ROM drive, since you'll almost
certainly be installing Linux from it. You have a SCSI system, so
get a SCSI CD-ROM. That's pretty much the end of spec, as SCSI
CD-ROMs are a very generic item. The only significant difference
among drivers is their speed&mdash;6x, 8x, 10x or up. It's hard to find
2x or 4x speeds anymore.</p><p>Again, bear in mind that you probably don't need the latest
and greatest. High-speed CD-ROMS are really designed for people
playing CD-ROM games or other applications involving image and
sound archives. If you're doing the Linux thing, chances are you'll
primarily use CD-ROMs that are code archives. Your average transfer
size will be small and an apparent speed of 6x or even 4x is quite
satisfactory. So here's a place to cut costs by buying well behind
the leading edge.</p><p>Next, consider a backup device. This is another place where
spending extra money pays. Cheap tape drives are unreliable, noisy
and have agonizingly slow transfer speeds. It's no fun to listen to
what sounds like a blender dicing celery for twenty minutes while
your disk is backed up, so with the cheap drives you'll quickly
find you're backing up less often than you really should.</p><p>The worst are the QIC mini-cartridge drives, including the
new Travan technology. They're also the cheapest, and thus, exactly
what clone makers tend to bundle and salespeople tend to push.
Avoid them. Quarter-inch QIC drives are less nasty, mainly because
they have higher transfer speed and get done quicker; also they're
usually engineered better for reliability. But you really want to
pay for a DAT or DLT drive.</p><p>Of course, buy 16MB of memory, unless you really like a
text-only console&mdash;X is not comfortable when memory is tight.
Having lots of free memory will also improve your virtual-memory
performance. Fortunately, with RAM as cheap as it is now this is
unlikely to bust your budget.</p><p>You'll also want a three-button serial mouse. I happen to
like the three-button Logitech MouseMan and its kin&mdash;just the thing
for a hacker's chronically cluttered desktop. Your mileage may
vary.</p><p>You'll want a modem, of course. 28.8 is recommended for
speediest possible net surfing. &ldquo;How to Buy a Modem&rdquo; could be an
article in itself; we won't try to cover it here.</p><p>The rest is basically frills and freebies. You can get a
sound card if you like, though under Linux you're not likely to use
it for anything but playing Doom. Every system sold today has the
requisite two floppy drives and two serial ports and one parallel
port.</p><p>That about does it for basic hardware. Later on we'll look at
some actual system configurations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x2674118"></a>Some Pitfalls To Avoid.</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don't</b></span> buy jumperless
peripheral cards, whether of the newer variety called
&ldquo;Plug'n'Play&rdquo; or the older kind that requires a DOS utility to
poke registers in the card at bootup time. These will cause you no
end of grief. Plug'n'Play isn't yet supported under Linux as I
write, and it would be totally nasty to have to boot DOS first
every time you want to run Linux. A lot of these cards don't even
hold their settings across a warm boot.</p><p>You need to be extra-vigilant about this when buying. The
tiny, reptilian brains of most computer salespeople cannot seem to
encompass the existence of clone-box OSs other than DOS or Windows.
They think boot-time setup utilities are just fine and jumperless
cards are the best things since sliced bread, because they are
easier to set up and a whole fifty cents cheaper. So they'll push
jumperless cards at you with glee and abandon. Foil them, or you'll
suffer for it later.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don't</b></span> buy so-called
&ldquo;WinModems&rdquo; or anything that advertises &ldquo;RPI&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rockwell
Peripheral Interface&rdquo; on the box. These are ways for manufacturers
to save a few bucks on firmware at your expense; they won't work
without driver software that runs only under Windows.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don't</b></span> get stuck with a
2-button mouse. Specifying a three-button model is an easy detail
to overlook when filling out your order.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x2674430"></a>How To Buy</h2></div></div><p>When I originally launched the Buyer's Guide years ago, the
major distribution channels for PCs were business-oriented
storefront dealerships and mail order. The dealerships had, and
still have, high overheads and higher prices. Accordingly, I
recommended mail order.</p><p>I still like mail order, especially for techies on a tight
budget. Publications like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer Shopper</em></span> and
their web site at http://www.netbuyer.com/, are a great way to get
a feel for prices, and these days most mail-order outfits with
enough cash to advertise on glossy paper are good risks. The online
version of my Buyer's Guide (see the URL at the top of this
article) has details on how to protect yourself when buying through
the mail.</p><p>These days, though, I'm also a fan of computer
superstores&mdash;outfits like CompUSA and Circuit City that sell
hundreds of machines a day out of warehouse-sized premises packed
to the ceiling with discounted hardware. These obviously have more
overhead than mail-order outfits, but their price premium over
mail-order is small. They make back a lot of their margin on
computer games and small accessories like mouse pads, cables and
floppy disks.</p><p>So, if you shop carefully and don't fall for one of their
name-brand &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; systems, you can get prices comparable to
mail order with the comfort of knowing there's a trouble desk you
can drive back to in a pinch. Also, you
<span   class="bold"><b>can</b></span> see your monitor before you
buy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x26746f0"></a>When To Buy</h2></div></div><p>In a market where prices are dropping fast, it's always
tempting to wait just another month or two to buy your hardware,
because you know it will then be less expensive.</p><p>A good way to cope with this problem is to configure your
system on paper, get a couple of initial estimates, then set a
target price, below the lowest one, at what you're willing to pay.
Then watch and wait. When the configuration cost hits your target
price, place your order.</p><p>The advantage of this method is that it requires you to
settle in your mind, well in advance, what you're willing to pay
for what you're getting. That way, you'll buy at the earliest time
you should, and won't stress out too much afterwards as it
depreciates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x26748a8"></a>The Recipe File</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at some sample components, keeping in mind the

configurations.</p><p>First, the deluxe system (A+E+F+G+H+I+K+M+N+O+P+Q): $2,824.
That's pretty far off our $2,000 target, but now let's strip away
as much as we can.</p><p>If we drop the 1.2MB floppy (you'll never use it), the
secondary disk, and then downgrade to a 15" monitor with 1024x768
resolution, and drop back to a Pentium 75 (D+E+F+H+I+J+L+N+O+P+Q),
suddenly the price is just $1,892.50.</p><p>Now, when you reflect that vendors of desktop systems buy in
volume and get the parts up to 40% cheaper than you can even by
mail-order, you can see that coming in under $1500 with a
Pentium-75 system shouldn't really be difficult at all.</p><p>Even without a system vendor's volume discount, moving back
up to a Pentium 100 (C+E+F+H+I+J+L+N+O+P+Q) makes our price
$1932.50, still below our $2000 target. The parts list above is
just intended as an example&mdash;it wouldn't actually be a good idea to
build your box by separately assembling pieces like that. It's
better and usually cheaper to go through a system vendor.</p><p>There are several advantages to using a system vendor. One is
the vendor's ability to buy in volume and carve its margins mainly
out of the volume discount it gets from parts suppliers. This is
especially important for big-ticket items like the motherboard and
disks. Another is expert assembly. A third is the pre-shipment
burn-in. And then, of course, there's the warranty&mdash;a very
reassuring thing to have in case your brand-new machine succumbs in
spite of that burn-in.</p><p>Once you've designed your configuration, you should get
quotes from two or three different system vendors. Any vendor who
can't generate quotes for a custom configuration, or resists giving
a quote without a buy commitment, is not worth your time&mdash;find
another.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x2675878"></a>Questions To Ask Your Vendor</h2></div></div><p>The weakest guarantee you should settle for should
include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>72-hour burn-in to avoid sudden death Also, try to
find out if they do a power-cycling test and how many repeats they
do; this stresses the hardware much more than steady
burn-in.</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee. Watch out for fine
print that weakens this with a re-stocking fee or limits it with
exclusions.</p></li><li><p>1 year parts and labor guarantee (some vendors give
2 years).</p></li><li><p>1 year of 800 number tech support (many vendors
give lifetime support).</p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, many vendors offer a year of on-site service
free. You should find out who they contract the service to. Also,
be sure the free service coverage area includes your site; some
unscrupulous vendors weasel their way out with &ldquo;some locations pay
extra,&rdquo; which translates roughly as &ldquo;through the nose if you're
further away than our parking lot.&rdquo;</p><p>If you're buying from a dealership or superstore, find out
what they'll guarantee beyond the above. If the answer is
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, go somewhere else.</p><p>Ask your potential suppliers what kind and volume of
documentation they supply with your hardware. You should get, at
minimum, operations manuals for the motherboard and each card or
peripheral. Skimpiness in this area is a valuable clue that they
may be using no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan, which is not
necessarily a red flag in itself, but should prompt you to ask more
questions.</p><p>There are various cost-cutting tactics a vendor can use which
bring down the system's overall quality. Here are some good
questions to ask:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Is the memory zero-wait-state? One or more wait
states allows the vendor to use slower and cheaper memory, but will
slow down your actual memory subsystem throughput. This is a
particularly important question for the cache memory.</p></li><li><p>If you're buying a factory-configured system, does
it have FCC certification? While it's not necessarily the case that
a non-certified system is going to spew a lot of radio-frequency
interference, certification is legally required&mdash;and becoming more
important as clock frequencies climb. Lack of that FCC sticker may
indicate a fly-by-night vendor, or at least one in danger of being
raided and shut down.</p></li><li><p>Are the internal cable connectors keyed, so they
can't be put in upside down? This doesn't matter if you'll never,
ever <span   class="bold"><b>ever</b></span> need to upgrade or
service your system. Otherwise, it's pretty important. Vendors who
fluff this detail may be quietly cutting other corners.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2182580.0x26760b8"></a>After You Take Delivery</h2></div></div><p>Your configuration is custom and involves slightly unusual
hardware. Therefore, keep a copy of the configuration you wrote
down, and check it against both the invoice and the actual
delivered hardware. If there is a problem, calling your vendor back
right away will maximize your chances of getting the matter settled
quickly.</p><p>Then install your Linux and have fun.</p></div></div>
