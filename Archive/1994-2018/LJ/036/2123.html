    Here is a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; program for indexing and retrieval of
    documents.

University may think the time I spend fiddling with Linux on a PC
could be put to better use, they are wrong. The &ldquo;fiddling with
Linux&rdquo; I do at home; at work I do only the minimum necessary to
keep Linux fed and happy. As most readers of this journal know,
this involves making the occasional backup and not much else.
</p><p>When I sit in front of my PC, I work (well, mostly). Linux
makes it possible to do my work with a minimum of fuss, and a big
part of the credit for this goes to Jacques Gelinas, the man who
wrote UMSDOS: a layer between the Unix operating system and the
vanilla MS-DOS file allocation table. This program makes it
possible to access the DOS partition of my hard disk from either
operating system. This is good news, since I am totally dependent
on two programs: SMART, an indexing and retrieval system, and SPSS
for Windows, which twiddles the data I obtain from SMART. SMART
runs only under Unix (and not all Unices, for that matter) and
SPSS4Windows, obviously, runs under MS Windows. Whatever the
virtues of this operating system may be, you emphatically do not
want to use it in any kind of experimental environment.</p><p>I suppose <span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>tatistical
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>ackage for the
<span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>ocial
<span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>ciences (SPSS) will be familiar
to most Linux users. If not&mdash;SPSS is a statistical package not only
for the &ldquo;social sciences&rdquo;, but also for anyone who needs
statistical analysis of his data.</p><p>SMART is an indexing and retrieval program for text. It not
only indexes the words, it also adds weights to them. It allows the
user to compare the indexed documents in the Vector Space Model and
compute the distances between documents or between documents and
queries. To understand why this is special, we must delve a bit
into the typical problems of information retrieval, i.e., the
storage of books, articles, etc., and their retrieval based on
content.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd9580.0x1dd1768"></a>Why Indexing Is Not Enough</h2></div></div><p>At the end of the 60s, automatic indexing of texts became a
viable option, and many people thought the problems of information
retrieval were solved. Programs like STAIRS (IBM, 1972) enabled the
users to file and rapidly retrieve documents using any word in the
text and boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) with those words&mdash;who
could ask for more? Then in 1985, a famous article was published by
two researchers in the field. <a href="2123s1.html" target="_self">Footnote
1</a>. In this article, they reported on the performance of
STAIRS in real life, and they showed that the efficiency of STAIRS
and similar systems was, in fact, much lower than assumed. Even
experienced users could not obtain a recall of more than 20-40% of
the relevant documents in a database of 100,000 documents, and
worse, they were not aware of this fact.</p><p>The problem with all retrieval systems of this type is that
human language is so fuzzy. There may be as many as a dozen
different terms and words pointing to one and the same object, and
one word may have widely different meanings. In information
retrieval, this can lead to one of two situations. One, you obtain
a high precision where almost all the retrieved documents are
relevant, but an unknown number of other relevant documents are not
included. Or two, you get a high recall that includes a lot of
irrelevant documents in the result. When the proportion of
irrelevant documents is high in a retrieved set of documents, the
user will most likely stop looking before he or she has found all
the relevant documents. At this point, his &ldquo;futility-point&rdquo; has
been reached. In such a case the net result is equivalent to those
relevant records <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> being
retrieved. Therefore, the concept of ranking, i.e., the ordering of
retrieved documents based on relevance, is very important in
information retrieval.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd9580.0x1dd1978"></a>SMART</h2></div></div><p>Modern (and not so modern) research has offered a number of
possible solutions to this dilemma, among them the concept of
<span   class="bold"><b>weighted</b></span> keywords. This means that
every keyword-document combination has a weight attached that is
(one hopes) an indication of the relevance of that particular
keyword for that particular document. SMART does just that: it
creates indices for a database of documents and attaches weights to
them. The method may be expressed intuitively as <span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;the
more a word occurs in fewer documents, the higher the
weight.&rdquo;</em></span> If the word &ldquo;dog&rdquo; occurs twenty times in a
given document but in no other documents, you may be relatively
certain that this document is about dogs. Information retrieval
addicts like me talk about the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tf</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>idf</em></span> weight.</p><p>SMART offers several calculation options (I generally prefer
the atc-variation, because it adjusts for the length of the
individual documents.) It calculates the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tf</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>idf</em></span> in three steps.
The first step creates the value</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>for the term-frequency (<span   class="emphasis"><em>tf</em></span>) as:</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>where</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f3.jpg"></div>
</p><p>is the term with the highest frequency in the document. This
adjusts for the document length and the number of terms. Then the
weight</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f4.jpg"></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f5.jpg"></div>
</p><p>where N is as before the number of documents and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> is the document frequency of term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>t</em></span> (the number of documents in which term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>t</em></span> occurs). Finally the cosine normalization is
applied by:</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2123f6.jpg"></div>
</p><p>where T is the number of terms in the document vector. Now we
have a number between zero and one that probably correlates with
the importance of the word as a keyword for that document. For a
detailed discussion of these and similar techniques see Salton and
McGill. <a href="2123s1.html" target="_self">Footnote 2</a>. You will love
it.</p><p>When SMART has constructed the index in one of the various
ways available, it can also retrieve the documents for you. This is
done according to something called the &ldquo;Vector Space Model&rdquo;. This
model is best explained using a three-dimensional example of a
vector-space; you can add another few thousand dimensions in your
own imagination.</p><p>Imagine you want to index your documents according to three
keywords&mdash;&ldquo;cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and &ldquo;horse&rdquo;&mdash;that may or may not occur
in your documents. So you draw three axes to get a normal
three-dimensional coordinate system. One dimension can be used to
indicate the &ldquo;cat-ness&rdquo; of every document, the other its
&ldquo;dog-ness&rdquo; and the third the &ldquo;horse-ness&rdquo;. To make things easy
we use only binary values 0 and 1, although SMART can cope with
floats (e.g., the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; mentioned before). So if a document
is about cats, it scores a 1 on the corresponding axis, otherwise
it scores 0. Any document may now be drawn in that space according
to the occurrence of one or more of the keywords, and so we have a
relatively easy way to compute the difference between documents.
Moreover, a query consisting of one or more of the keywords can be
drawn in the same space, and the documents can be ranked according
to the distance to that query. Of course a typical document
database has thousands of keywords and, accordingly, thousands of
dimensions, but the arithmetic involved in multi-dimensional
distances does not matter much to modern computers.</p><p>So SMART accepts queries, ranks the documents according to
the &ldquo;nearness&rdquo; to that query and returns them to you in that
order. This ability makes it one of the best retrieval systems ever
written, even though it lacks the bells and whistles of its more
expensive counterparts. Although it is not really optimized for
speed, it typically runs 10-30 times faster than the fastest
indexing program for MS Windows that I have tried.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd9580.0x1dd29a0"></a>The DOS Connection</h2></div></div><p>I do not use SMART for bread-and-butter retrieval, but for
the weights it computes and the indices it creates. At this point I
usually want to do some other manipulations of the data. I offer my
thanks to the developers of Unix in general and to Linux in
particular for creating a whole string of ever more complicated and
sophisticated shell scripts, the standard Unix tools and a few of
&ldquo;My Very Own&rdquo; utilities that suffice to process the SMART output
to a file that is ready for import into SPSS.</p><p>Now I have to quit Linux and boot MS-DOS, start MS Windows
and finally enter SPSS to do the statistics and create some graphs.
I am a newcomer to Unix (indeed it was the fact that Linux offered
a way to use SMART that pulled me over the line two years ago).
While MS Windows is not my favorite operating system, SPSS gets the
job done. When the output is written to disk, I immediately escape
back to Linux to write the final article, report, or whatever with
LaTeX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd9580.0x1dd2b00"></a>The Bad News</h2></div></div><p>On this point I have two messages&mdash;one bad. The good news is
that SMART is obtainable by anonymous ftp from Cornell University
and can be used free for scientific and experimental purposes.
Better yet, it compiles under Linux without much tweaking and
twiddling. There is also a fairly active mailing list for people
who use SMART (smart-people@cs.cornell.edu).</p><p>The bad news: the manual&mdash;what manual? SMART is not for the
faint of heart; after unpacking and compilation, you'll find some
extremely obscure notes and examples, and that is all.
Nevertheless, if you have more than just a few megabytes of text to
manage <span   class="bold"><b>and</b></span> the stamina to learn
SMART, it certainly is the best solution for your information
retrieval needs. I do wish someone would write a comprehensive
manual. In the meantime, you may be helped by my &ldquo;tutorial for
newbies&rdquo; found at
