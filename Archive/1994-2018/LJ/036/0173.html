    Assembly language is a wonderful tool for teaching about how
    computers work.
    Professor Sevenich explains how it is used at WSU.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a14580.0x1b0c450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the core program for our computer
science curricula we offer two assembly language courses as
elements in that part of our sequence providing hardware emphasis.
Although the students do learn to program in this arcane language,
the emphasis is on using assembly language as a detective's tool to
learn about the underlying hardware.
</p><p>Both courses involve the omnipresent Intel
80<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>8<span   class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span> architecture.
However, the first course treats the chip as an 8086/88 and works
within the MS-DOS environment. Insofar as is practical within the
existing time constraints, we pretend that MS-DOS is not present
and try to simulate an embedded systems environment. The essential
fact is that MS-DOS puts us in charge of the system resources,
i.e., in real address mode. This first course is a prerequisite for
our subsequent hardware courses.</p><p>The focus of the second course is to examine the architecture
elements that support a multitasking, multiuser operating system.
For this course we have chosen Linux as the environment. This
second course is a prerequisite for subsequent hardware courses as
well as for our operating systems sequence. Linux is typically used
in the latter. Of course, in such a sophisticated multitasking,
multiuser system we no longer have direct control over the hardware
resources. It is of central interest to see how the operating
system protects itself.</p><p>This article discusses the second course. The intended
audience consists of those who have an interest in the features of
the 80<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>86 (<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> &gt;= 3)
Intel architecture that support an operating system such as Linux.
The two techniques we use for investigating are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Write our own assembly language code to probe the
architecture.</p></li><li><p>Examine assembly language written by others.</p></li></ol></div><p>These two approaches are discussed in their respective
sections later in this article. This article is not an attempt to
investigate the Intel architecture (a subject for a large volume),
but to describe the tools and resources available to do so.</p><p>Virtually all textbooks on the Intel
80<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>8<span   class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span> architecture assume
that the reader is working in a Microsoft environment, usually with
the Microsoft Assembler, MASM. Because we are working in a Linux
environment, we do not use such traditional textbooks; instead we
use as the primary resource the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Intel486 Processor
Family: Programmer's Reference Manual</em></span> (1995), Intel
Order Number 240486-003. This is a large manual and of special
interest are Parts I and II dealing with application and system
programming, respectively. Other useful resources are the on-line
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel Hacker's Guide</em></span> (see
http://www.ssc.com/linux/ldp.html), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Brennan's Guide to
Inline Assembly</em></span> (see
http://www.rt66.com/-brennan/djgpp/djgpp_asm.html), and the various
man pages and info documents available within Linux itself. Using
such a set of resources rather than a focused textbook is, of
course, typically how a <span   class="emphasis"><em>real world</em></span> software
engineer operates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a14580.0x1b0cc38"></a>Why Use Linux? Which Distribution?</h2></div></div><p>Linux is a natural choice for rather obvious reasons:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It is free.</p></li><li><p>It includes a complete set of development and
detective tools.</p></li><li><p>The source code is available.</p></li><li><p>It is an evolving multitasking, multiuser
environment making use of the advanced features of the underlying
chip architecture.</p></li></ol></div><p>I recommend Debian GNU/Linux to our students because:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It is quite stable.</p></li><li><p>It can be updated/upgraded nondestructively, in
place.</p></li><li><p>Various libraries are in the standard
locations.</p></li><li><p>It is non-commercial, so students can get more
seriously involved with maintenance and development later in the
curriculum.</p></li><li><p>The Debian users and developers are extremely
responsive and helpful.</p></li></ol></div><p>Other distributions such as Red Hat or Craftworks meet most
of these requirements quite well also, except for item 4, which is
important for our students, but perhaps not to others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a14580.0x1b0d4d0"></a>Writing Our Own Assembly Language
Programs</h2></div></div><p>We have found it convenient and productive to write our
assembly language in-line within C source code. Labels can be
interjected in the source code at appropriate places to provide
breakpoints for the debugger. The primary motivation for writing
in-line assembly language is to examine architectural features. The
assembly language statements are AT&amp;T style rather than Intel
style. The former seems to be the Unix custom.</p><p>As a simple example, we'll exhibit a short program,
example1.c (see <a href="0173l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>), whose
purpose is to examine the flags register which has three types of
flag bits: status bits (e.g., the Carry Flag), system flags (e.g.,
the two bit combination giving the I/O Privilege Level), and a
control flag, the Direction Flag. The program does the
following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Puts a copy of the flags register in the eax
register for examination (breakpoint bp1).</p></li><li><p>Flips all the bits in that copy (breakpoint
bp2).</p></li><li><p>Attempts to write that bit-flipped copy into the
flags register and then puts a copy of the resulting flags register
into eax for examination (breakpoint bp3).</p></li></ol></div><p>Note how in-line assembly language is supported by the
<b  >asm</b> macro.</p><p>To compile this into the executable program example1.x,
containing necessary information for subsequent use by the
debugger, we use the <b  >-g</b> switch in the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -g example1.c -o example1.x
</pre><p>The next step is to invoke the debugger. It is convenient to
also get a log of the debugger activities via a pipe to the tee
command so the command line entry would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gdb -silent example1.x | tee example1.log
</pre>


yielding the gdb prompt
<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb)
</pre>


Now gdb is ready to run example1.c, while tee will produce a record
of our activity in example1.log. The latter can be printed or
examined with an editor.
</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this article to also be a tutorial
on the use of gdb; such documentation is readily available in man
page and info format. In addition, for use within a browser, one
can find, in html format, the FSF document <span   class="emphasis"><em>Debugging with
gdb</em></span> by Stallman and Pesch. One current URL for this is:
http://funnelweb.utcc.utk/~harp/gnu/tars.</p><p>It might be more efficient to first look at the terse,
readable introduction to gdb given in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting to Know
gdb</em></span> by Loukides and Oram in Issue 29 of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (September 1996).</p><p>Having said that, let's at least show a typical example1.log
(see <a href="0173l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>) which shows
setting breakpoints and then stopping at those breakpoints to
examine registers of interest. Lines starting with the
<b  >(gdb)</b> prompt are commands entered by the user,
whereas everything else is information volunteered by the
debugger.</p><p>The log file tells the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The original value of the flags register was
0x246.</p></li><li><p>`Our attempt to flip all the bits and write the
flipped value back to the flags register was only partially
successful and that attempt generated an exception (signal
<b  >SIGTRAP</b>).</p></li></ul></div><p>The investigator might go through a questioning process
rather like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What does the original value of the flags register
mean in terms of individual bits (e.g., what is the I/O Privilege
Level)?</p></li><li><p>Which instruction generated an exception and
why?</p></li><li><p>Which bits could be flipped and which could not?
Why?</p></li></ul></div><p>Interesting facts are then uncovered. For example, in the log
file shown, the ID flag (bit 21) was successfully flipped.
According to the Intel documentation this indicates that this
processor can execute the CPU_ID instruction. On the other hand,
the bits giving the I/O Privilege Level (bits 12 and 13) could not
be modified. Clearly, that is expected&mdash;the casual user should not
be able to change anything that might help get at the I/O hardware
directly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a14580.0x1f06640"></a>Examining Assembly Language as Written by
Others</h2></div></div><p>Typically, even for device drivers, Linux developers do not
use assembly language. Hence, it is particularly revealing to
examine those very few parts of the kernel which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> written in assembly language. These can be
found within the Linux distributions with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find -name *.S
</pre><p>entered from the root directory. Of particular interest are
these:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>bootsect.S (Intel style instructions)</p></li><li><p>setup.S (Intel style)</p></li><li><p>head.S (AT&amp;T style)</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>These are heavily commented, but additional guidance can be
found in the Intel documentation and in Alessandro Rubini's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tour of the Linux Kernel Source</em></span>, found in the
Kernel Hacker's Guide. These modules do the first portions of
system initialization, a process which is completed by C routines.
Once they have been executed, the assembly language routines are
done. Another module of interest is entry.S (AT&amp;T style) whose
tasks are ongoing. In particular, it contains low level routines
for handling system calls and faults.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a14580.0x1f06b68"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This material should help interested readers start their own
investigations of the Intel 80<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>86
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> &gt;= 3) architecture and the Linux kernel.
Much can then be learned about such topics as operating modes,
memory management, and building the various descriptor
tables.</p></div></div>
