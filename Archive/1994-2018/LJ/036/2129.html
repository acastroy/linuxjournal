two analog modems into one so as to double the speed of a
connection. Is this true? If so, how does this work and where can I
get more information on how to do this? I have Slackware 96. &mdash;Keith

feature you must compile into your kernel for load balancing to
work and it is designed to work only with SLIP or PPP. The feature
you must compile is EQL, or &ldquo;Serial Line Load Balancing&rdquo;. As you
configure your kernel there is a small amount of help available on
the option. If you look at the file
<b  >/linux-source-directory/drivers/net/README.eql</b>,
you can get more information on how this works and what you need to
do. Be aware that this must be supported by the other end of the
connection&mdash;either another Linux box compiled with this feature or
a Livingston Portmaster 2e. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services

terminal (serial) using a DOS term program. It's a 486 that used to
be my main machine until I upgraded. I have been trying to find
information on setting it up as an X terminal, but all the HOWTO
and <b  >/usr/doc</b> files seem to focus on other
things. It's my understanding that if I put a small Linux kernel on
it and use NFS for root that I should be able to do this as the
machine has very limited resources these days. I know I can switch
to PLIP for reasonable speed, and I have good documentation on
using NFS as root, but I have not uncovered the missing information
on setting it up as an X terminal. Can you direct me to a
source? &mdash;Josh</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10be580.0x11b6ef8"></a>Inexpensive Hardware and xdm</h2></div></div><p>You do need at least some disk resources to be able to set
your H86 up as an X-terminal. There are ways to do a complete
net-boot on a PC, but those include obtaining a 3C509 or NE2000
Ethernet card and a boot ROM. I haven't dealt with this method,
though, because hard disks are becoming very cheap.</p><p>I recommend getting a 120MB IDE drive (you should be able to
find a used one for around $25), and installing that. Then install
a minimal Linux system including X, and you are set. You will need
networking of some type since most Linux distributions require
Ethernet for a network install. If you don't have a CD-ROM on that
box, you'll probably want to do a network install, so pick up a
cheap networking card (new NE2000 clones run about $25).</p><p>Now, for using the 486 as an X terminal, the easiest way is
with xdm. You run it on your main machine, configure X on your 486,
and you can then run <b  >X -query hostname</b> on your
other machine. That solution will run an X server locally, but will
run all binaries off your main machine. &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red Hat

got connected to the Internet with ISDN and a Pipeline 50 and were
given a single class C address. We have created a subnet scheme for
assigning IPs to all of our WFW3.11, Win95, and WinNT computers.
When we tried to set up the Linux box as an HTTP and ftp server, we
were unable to get the Linux software to accept 255.255.255.224 as
the subnet mask. Will Linux do subnets this way? &mdash;Richard C.
Guglomo</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10be580.0x11b79f8"></a>Linux And Subnets</h2></div></div><p>Linux does do subnets, and 224 is a valid mask. Valid masks
must have contiguous high bits set and 224 is 1110 0000 in binary.
In theory this should work, but there are some pitfalls.</p><p>It could be that the IP you are assigning to the interface
isn't on a valid 224 subnet. With that mask your network addresses
will be 5 bits. In other words, subnets will fall on multiples of
32 (decimal)&mdash;0, 32, 64. Those IP addresses are &ldquo;network
addresses&rdquo; and can't be used for an interface. Similarly, the
&ldquo;all ones&rdquo; addresses are reserved for broadcast&mdash;that would be
31, 63, and so on in this case.</p><p>You cannot assign a network address as the IP for a specific
interface. So, you can't use something like 192.168.1.32 as the
interface address. Instead you should use 33-62 for the devices on
the 32 subnet (63 would be the broadcast address and is also
reserved), 65-95 for the 62 subnet, and so on. &mdash;Bob Hauck, Wasatch
