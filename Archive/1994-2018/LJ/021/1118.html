    If you have tried version control, but are frustrated by the
    need to set explicit locks every time you want to edit a
    file, or perhaps dislike being unable to edit a file when
    other developers have already locked a file, CVS is for you.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x11c9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a
version control system. With CVS, developers are able to review the
change history of any source file, retrieve any revision of a
particular file, avoid overwriting one another's changes, and keep
track of releases and the file revisions that go along with them.
</p><p>First, a short introduction to some of the concepts of CVS.
All the sources for a project are stored in a central location
called the repository. The sources in the repository are organized
into modules. Typically each module represents a separate project.
A module can represent any number of files and directories.</p><p>When a developer wishes to work with a particular set of
sources he uses CVS to retrieve a local copy of them. This local
copy can represent the most recent revision of each file or some
past revision.</p><p>Typical version control systems require a user to &ldquo;lock&rdquo;
each file he wishes to edit, preventing other developers from
editing these files until the first user has committed his changes.
This can be quite time consuming as developers either wait for one
another to commit changes, or work simultaneously and manually
merge the changes together later on. CVS solves this problem by
allowing concurrent editing.</p><p>Concurrent editing allows two or more developers to work
concurrently on the same files. Ordinarily, concurrent editing
leads to one developer overwriting another's previously committed
changes.</p><p>CVS prevents overwrites by forcing a developer to merge into
his local copy any changes that have been committed to a file in
the repository since he retrieved his local copy of that file. Only
then can the developer commit his changes. The process is mostly
automatic, but if, for instance, changes have been made to the same
line of code in both the repository and the local copy, manual
resolution of the conflict is necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x11c9558"></a>A day in the Life of...,</h2></div></div><p>Let's look in on our software development team in action. Due
to the confidentiality of their project, all the file names have
been changed to protect the innocent. Their project is to &ldquo;build a
better mouse trap.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x11c9660"></a>Fixing Bugs</h2></div></div><p>Fezzik, though primarily a documentation writer,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>(This explains why all our team's manuals are in
rhyme.)</em></span> does some detecting and squashing of software
bugs in the course of his work. Let's watch as Fezzik fixes a
critical bug in a previous release of the product.</p><p>Version 4.0 of the product was released a few months ago. Now
a critical bug has been found by a very important customer. The bug
must be fixed in the released version of the software, a point
release made for the customer, and the fix must be merged into the
working version of the software.</p><p>In investigating the problem, Fezzik has determined that the
bug was introduced between the 3.3 and 4.0 versions of the
software. His first step is to get a copy of the 4.0 sources. He
does this with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout -r PROD_REL4-0 mousetrap
</pre><p>This will check out all of the directories and source code
files for the entire project. The version of each source file will
be the version that was included in the release with the name
PROD_REL4-0, exclusive of any changes that have been to that source
file since the release.</p><p>Now Fezzik has a new directory called mousetrap. In this
directory are all the project sources as they were when the release
4.0 was made. Because development on the project has continued
since release 4.0, Fezzik must start a new branch on the revision
tree from this point. He uses the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs tag -b POINT_RELS_REL4-0
cvs update -r POINT_RELS_REL4-0
</pre><p>The revision tree will look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

                    |HEAD - dev for next full release
POINT_RELS_REL4-0\  |
                  \ |
                   \|
                    +PROD_REL4-0
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    +PROD_REL3-3
                    |
                    |
</pre><p>Fezzik could have created the branch tag before checking out
the project, eliminating one step from the method he used. The
following sequence would produce the same effect as above:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs rtag -b -r PROD_REL4-0 POINT_RELS_REL4-0 mousetrap
cvs checkout -r POINT_RELS_REL4-0
</pre><p>CVS has many command and option combinations. Therefore,
there is often more than one way to produce the same or similar
results. This flexibility allows CVS to be adapted to a wide range
of development processes.</p><p>Fezzik suspects that the file cheese.c contains the bug, so
he decides to view all the changes made to that file between
releases 3.3 and 4.0. To do this he uses the diff command:</p><p><b  >cvs diff -r PROD_REL3-3 cheese.c</b></p><p>This produces a listing of the differences between the file
cheese.c in our current directory and the revision used in
PROD_REL3-3. Fezzik could have specified a second revision with
a</p><p><b  >-r PROD_REL4-0</b></p><p>and had the same effect.</p><p>In reviewing the differences, Fezzik finds what he believes
to be the bug he is looking for. He would like to clear any
modifications he plans with the person who made the change, so he
looks at the log file for cheese.c.</p><p><b  >cvs log cheese.c</b></p><p>He sees that only Buttercup modified this file between the
two releases, so he is able to talk to her about the fix. After
making the fix and testing it, Fezzik is ready to commit his
changes. He issues the following command from the top directory of
the project:</p><p><b  >cvs commit -m "Fixed bug #1202"</b></p><p>Fezzik did not specify a specific file to commit, so this
command will commit all modified files in this directory and,
recursively, in all of its subdirectories. Each file committed will
have the message &ldquo;Fixed bug #1202&rdquo; added as a log message. Since
this fix will be sent to a customer, Fezzik decides to tag the set
of files that will be sent:</p><p><b  >cvs tag PROD_REL4-0-1</b></p><p>Now Fezzik needs to create the patch file to be sent to the
customer:</p><p><b  >cvs rdiff -r PROD_REL4-0 -r PROD_REL4-0-1 mousetrap
&gt; patch4.0-4.0.1</b></p><p>This creates a Larry Wall format patch file which the
customer can feed into the patch program to update his sources. The
patches will update the customer's 4.0 sources to the new 4.0.1
sources.</p><p>Now Fezzik needs to merge the fix into the current
development sources. First he updates his sources to the latest
revisions on the main thread by using this command:</p><p><b  >cvs update -A</b></p><p>This has the same effect as deleting the local copy of the
module, and doing a new checkout of the module, thereby getting the
latest revisions.</p><p>Then he has CVS automatically merge in the changes from the
4.0.1 point release with:</p><p><b  >cvs update -j PROD_REL4-0-1</b></p><p>CVS will automatically merge the changes Fezzik made on the
branch into these latest sources. If the merging of the two sets of
sources causes conflicts, CVS will announce this. At the conflict
points in the file, there will be delimited regions containing the
text from both sources. These regions will need to be merged
manually.</p><p>Once everything is merged, Fezzik can commit all of the
changes using another commit command:</p><p><b  >cvs commit -m "Merged in fixes in
PROD_REL4-0-1"</b></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x11ca630"></a>Contention</h2></div></div><p>Now we turn to Westley, who will demonstrate how CVS is used
when working on a multiple-person project.</p><p>Westley has been off the project for a month <span   class="emphasis"><em>[ not
too surprising, what with his having been dead and all]</em></span>.
The first thing he needs to do is bring his sources up to
date.</p><p><b  >cvs update</b></p><p>Since he has not modified anything since his last commit
everything simply updates; no conflicts could exist. Now Westley
would like to see what has happened since his departure on April
10. He uses the following command to view all the log messages for
the commits that were made after April 10th:</p><p><b  >cvs log -d&gt;4/10 -b</b></p><p>After reviewing the log file he feels caught up, so he jumps
right into modifying sources. During the course of his work he
needs to create a new file, happiness.c. After he creates the file
happiness.c on the disk, he issues the following command:</p><p><b  >cvs add happiness.c</b></p><p>Westley also obsoletes a file, and after deleting the file,
he issues the following command:</p><p><b  >cvs delete agony.c</b></p><p>Both the add and delete commands will not take full effect
until the CVS commit is done.</p><p>After a day of work, Westley has added a new feature and is
ready to commit his modifications. He issues the following
command:</p><p><b  >cvs commit -m "Made a number of wonderful
improvements"</b></p><p>CVS informs him that someone else has already committed
changes to some of the files that he has made changes to, so he
must update his files with the other developer's changes before
committing his own. A simple call to the update command will do
this:</p><p><b  >cvs update</b></p><p>After manually editing to resolve any conflicts between his
changes and the changes already made to the repository, Westley
tests his new feature again. Everything looks okay, so he attempts
his commit again:</p><p><b  >cvs commit -m "Made a number of wonderful
improvements"</b></p><p>This time it works. This method of working is quite an
improvement over many systems where a person must first lock a file
before it can be edited, and anyone else wanting to edit the file
must wait until the first person has committed changes and unlocked
the file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x15c31c8"></a>Releases</h2></div></div><p>Now Buttercup will demonstrate how to release a new version
of the software. She begins by checking out the latest
sources.</p><p><b  >cvs checkout mousetrap</b></p><p>After verifying that these sources are the exact versions
that should be released, she tags the release:</p><p><b  >cvs tag PROD_REL4-1</b></p><p>Then she creates a set of directories containing all of the
sources to be delivered by using the export command:</p><p><b  >cvs export -R PROD_REL4-1 mousetrap</b></p><p>This will create a directory structure filled with only the
correct sources and none of the CVS administration directories or
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d1580.0x15c35e8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The full power of CVS exceeds the scope of this article, but
I hope I have provided enough of a taste to entice you to try CVS.
