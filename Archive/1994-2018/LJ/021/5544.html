    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0xda6190"></a></h2></div></div><p>In <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
21-issue history we have already had two issues that focused on the
World Wide Web. Many people (including myself) have found answers
to Web-related questions in those and other issues of
<i  >LJ</i>.
</p><p>Early in 1995, SSC, the company that publishes
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, decided to establish a Web
site. We decided, of course, to base it on a Linux system. We
cautiously promoted it while waiting for some problems to appear.
We watched page hits grow from less than 10,000 per day to over
35,000 per day. Performance continues to be excellent as we happily
provide articles from back issues of <i  >LJ</i>, links
to advertisers, SSC's own product catalog and more. (If you have
Web access and haven't taken a look. you should. The URL is
<a href="http://www.ssc.com" target="_self">www.ssc.com</a>)</p><p>Back in June, I was reading one of the Web-related articles
in <i  >LJ</i> and realized that the growing hoards of
Web developers needed the same sort of concise technical
information that <i  >Linux Journal</i> is offering the
Linux community. After talking to Belinda Frazier, Associate
Publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, about the idea and
seeing that we were in agreement, we started doing some research.
Our conclusion was that while there were lots of Web and Internet
magazines, most primarily addressed the &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;, i.e., the Web
Surfer.</p><p>With virtually exponential growth in the Web community and
substantial drops in the cost of providing a Web presence it was
clear that the development end needed to be addressed. And the
amazing speed at which changes are appearing dictated that a
magazine was a better approach than a book or series of
books.</p><p>At this point, Belinda paid the price of agreeing with me.
She got saddled with the job of Publisher of the new magazine. My
contribution consisted of sparing her the same mistakes we made
starting <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Happily, I can say
that we fewer mistakes have been made in this effort than with
<i  >LJ</i>. After we start 50 or more magazines we may
have it all down pat.</p><p>One of the best decisions we made was to introduce
<span   class="bold"><b>WEBsmith</b></span> as a supplement to
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. After all, the idea came from
articles in <i  >LJ</i>, much of the Linux community
has been involved in the Internet, and the Web and Linux make a
first-class Web server.</p><p>A recent survey showed that 9% of all Web servers are
Linux-based. That makes it th second most popular Unix-like
platform (behind Sun). While <span   class="emphasis"><em>WEBsmith</em></span> is not
intended to be another Linux magazine, my personal hope is that we
can show the growing Web community that we have a pretty handy
operating system here for doing Web work. If you are interested in
the Web&mdash;either as a developer or a manager who needs to build a
Web presence for your company&mdash;I encourage you to subscribe to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>WEBsmith</em></span>. Expect the same high-quality
technical articles you have come to expect in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, addressing your concerns and answering your
questions.</p></div></div>
