    When Linux boots, it displays a &ldquo;BogoMips&rdquo; number. What does
    that mean? Is the number displayed correct? What use is the
    infromation? This quintessential part of Linux is
    demystified in this article.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some device drivers in the Linux kernel
need timing delays. Either they need a very short delay, or the
delay must be very accurately determined. A simple non-busy loop
cannot do this. Therefore, Linus Torvalds added a calibration in
the boot procedure to predetermine how often a specific busy-loop
algorithm can be calculated in one second. This predetermined
value, called <b  >loops_per_second</b>, is used in the
device drivers to delay for precisely measured times.
</p><p>For fun, Linus also added a print statement presenting this
predetermined value (divided by 500,000) as BogoMips. Linus
apparently loves it when millions of Linux users are gazing at
their computer, baffled by these bogus MIPS. Note that BogoMips
have nothing to do with the million instructions per second that
the name suggests; that is why they are bogus.</p><p>The only serious reason for paying attention to the BogoMips
presented on booting Linux is to see whether it is in the proper
range for the particular processor, its clock frequency, and the
potentially present cache. 486 systems are especially prone to
faulty setups of RAM caching, turbo-buttons, and such
things.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262710"></a>Which Value to Expect</h2></div></div><p>People continuously ask on Usenet: &ldquo;I have an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>XYZ</em></span> CPU running at <span   class="emphasis"><em>clock</em></span>
MHz. How many BogoMips should it do?&rdquo; The answer can be calculated
from the following table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Intel/AMD 386SX    clock * 0.14 (&plusmn; 0.01)
Intel/AMD 386DX    clock * 0.18 (&plusmn; 0.01)
Cyrix/IBM 486      clock * 0.33 (&plusmn; 0.04)
Intel/AMD 486      clock * 0.50 (&plusmn; 0.01)
Pentium            clock * 0.40 (&plusmn; 0.01)
680x0              (insufficient data)
PowerPC            clock * 0.77 (&plusmn; 0.02)
Mips               (insufficient data)
Alpha              clock * 0.99 (&plusmn; 0.01)
</pre><p>From the above calculation we see several important points.
First of all, the Intel and AMD 486 CPUs are not showing the same
BogoMips as Cyrix and IBM 486 CPUs. This does not mean that they
have a different perceived performance; it just means that they
process the busy-loop algorithm differently.</p><p>The table also shows that the Pentium processor doesn't have
the expected extrapolated multiplication factor. This is due to the
fact that the specific busy-loop algorithm is not optimized for the
parallelism of the Pentium processor.</p><p>The BogoMips calculations for the Motorola, PowerPC, Mips,
and Alpha processors are similar to the Intel type processors
calculations. Because the non-busy loop algorithm is coded in
Assembler, however, they cannot be identical. It clearly shows that
comparison of BogoMips between CPUs is really bogus, even between
two different Intel type CPUs.</p><p>Last but not least, you see an allowed variation in the
multiplication factor of about 0.01. The BogoMips calculation loop
is &ldquo;quantizised&rdquo; (Linus's term), so it is likely that you will
get exactly the same number all the time. Yet, if the speed is just
on the edge, small variations, such as different lengths for
interrupts, will cause your machine's BogoMips to vary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262a80"></a>The Most Frequently Asked Question</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;When I boot Linux I get the message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 23.96 BogoMips
failed
</pre><p>Where or why has the calibration delay loop failed?&rdquo;</p><p>The obvious answer is that it <span   class="emphasis"><em>didn't</em></span>
fail. If it had failed the text would have been:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Calibrating delay loop.. failed
</pre><p>What likely <span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> fail was a driver for
some gadget which may not be in the machine. The point is that just
after calculating the BogoMips, all device drivers are initialized:
first the SCSI devices, then Net devices, etc. Any failure in these
initializations is duly reported. The AHA152x drive is noted for
such failures. Other effects of failing drivers (and not of failing
BogoMips calculations) are systems crashes, long waits, and
complete system lock-ups.</p><p>Since Linux 1.2, many error messages have improved, so
upgrade to at least that version to find out which particular
driver is failing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262e48"></a>Standalone BogoMips Program</h2></div></div><p>For people without Linux systems, or for those people who do
not want to reboot their system time and again, a stand-alone
program for calculating BogoMips is available in the standard
archives (e.g., on sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/system/Status/bogo-1.2.tar.gz). On Linux, by default, it
runs the same code that is used in the Linux kernel while booting,
but runs as a user program. Note that due to system load, values
calculated with the stand-alone program may be lower than expected
for the CPU you are running, and lower than reported during boot.
For the non-Linux systems, a portable C version is available that
may run on any system that supports an ANSI C compiler and
library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262f50"></a>Complete Reference Table: BogoMips
Mini-HOWTO</h2></div></div><p>The BogoMips mini-HOWTO gives a full table of reported
BogoMips for various systems. More than 250 BogoMips references as
reported on Usenet, or sent directly by e-mail to the maintainer,
are listed with information about CPU type, clock speed, BogoMips,
and the name and e-mail address of the reporter. For example, the
lowest and highest BogoMips reported in the current version of The
BogoMips Mini-HOWTO are:</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Lowest: H. Peter Anwin pa@nwu.edu 386SX/16 387
nocache 0.57 BogoMips The Highest: David Mosberger-Tang
davidm@cs.arizona.edu Alpha 21064A/275 273.37 BogoMips</em></span>
</p><p>In the BogoMips mini-HOWTO, values that do and do not comply
with the aforementioned BogoMips calculation methods are listed.
The non-complying group is named &ldquo;Oddly or Faultily configured&rdquo;
because non-compliance does not necessarily mean that the system is
faultily configured.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1263160"></a>Benchmarking</h2></div></div><p>The BogoMips may be used to see whether your system is faster
than mine. Of course this is completely wrong, unreliable,
ill-founded, and utterly useless, but all benchmarks suffer from
this problem, so why not use it? This inherent stupidity has never
before stopped people from using benchmarks, has it? [Note for the
humor-challenged: no angry letters to the editor will be accepted
on this point. &mdash;Ed]</p></div></div>
