    In a rare opinion column, our editor turns Socrates and asks:
    &ldquo;What is
    success?&rdquo;
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224e580.0x2346190"></a></h2></div></div><p>As Linux approaches the fifth anniversary
of its conception (in June), it is perhaps worthwhile to ask if it
has been a success so far. It has certainly been far more
successful than anyone originally thought it could be, as support
for new hardware has increased tremendously and users all over the
world number at least in the hundreds of thousands, and more likely
in the millions. Is that success?
</p><p>For those of us who use it every day to take care of all of
our computing needs, Linux is a success regardless of the numbers
of people and organizations who use it. Without even a magazine for
its users, it would be a success. Without commercial applications,
it would still be a success. Linux has nothing to prove.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that there is nothing to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>im</em></span>prove.</p><p>Linux is a success with technical people, and has been for a
long time. Linux comes with a huge, well-understood tool box of
programs for data manipulation and services. And for basic,
well-understood services, the Linux distributions provide (more or
less) out-of-the-box solutions. FTP services, WWW services, NFS
file services, LPD print services, SMB/Lan Manager file and print
services, and more all work out-of-the-box, or with a little
configuration. In part because of this, Linux is seeing growing
personal, corporate, educational, and governmental use.</p><p>So what's missing? Fairly obviously, as Linus Torvalds
himself points out, a wide choice of desktop applications. But
that's being worked on (native applications, Wine, DOSEMU,
Executor) and nothing I could say would speed up any of those
projects. Instead, I'd like to present one particular challenge for
growth: the market for pre-configured (&ldquo;works out-of-the-box&rdquo;)
software that fills the needs of particular niche markets. If this
challenge isn't met, Linux will still be a success; Linux use won't
shrink. This is just an area in which Linux has the potential to be
very useful, but where important pieces are still missing.</p><p>I'll use the example of Point Of Sale (POS) systems, since I
know a little bit about them. It is very definitely possible for a
technically competent person to use a Linux system to create a POS
system. The goal is essentially to piece together a database with a
terminal or network of terminals in order to quickly look up the
prices of individual items and compute the total cost of a sale, as
well as manage inventory and do financial transactions.</p><p>The standard Linux techie (call him Jon Hacker) answer runs
something like this: &ldquo;Oh, that's easy. Just build a database (flat
text, DBM, Postgres 95, or one of the commercial databases for
Linux) and write a program (Tcl/Tk for X, curses for text
terminals) for a user interface. I could do that in a week. Then
add things like credit card validation on-line, inventory control,
etc. That could take, um, a while longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Jo Store Owner doesn't have a week. She isn't a guru, and she
doesn't have a guru to write the system for her, either. And she's
not going to hire Jon Hacker to write a POS system based on Linux,
since she can buy a system that does meet her needs&mdash;though
perhaps not as well as a customized system&mdash;which runs on DOS or
Windows or Mac, and it will cost her less to get it up and running.
It may not be as well customized for her business, and it may not
even be flexible enough to customize, but it will work well enough
for her, and to instead hire Jon Hacker would invoke the law of
diminishing returns&mdash;it simply wouldn't be profitable.</p><p>However, if a POS package (free or commercial; it doesn't
much matter) were available for Linux, and came configured
intelligently, but used Linux tools to do the job and was therefore
easily customized, it would be an attractive option. Joe might even
hire Jon to customize it for him.</p><p>My point isn't really POS systems; there is already at least
one complete POS system based on Linux. However, there are lots of
niches like this that Linux is a great technology base for, but
which don't have off-the-shelf solutions based on Linux yet, even
though more free and commercial tools are available all the time.
(Read comp.os.linux.announce and <i  >LJ</i>'s own
<span   class="bold"><b>New Products</b></span> if you need
convincing.) Being able to start doing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> after running a simple installation
(like <b  >a:setup</b> under DOS and Windows) is the
basis of meeting this challenge.</p><p>As I see it, this challenge
<span   class="bold"><b>is</b></span> being met to some degree, but
sporadically and piecemeal. My goal is merely to help popularize
the idea of making Linux a useful business solution, and encourage
Jon Hacker to search for and support niches in a way that Jo Store
Owner can understand and trust. I'm not suggesting this to help
Linux take over the world, but rather because I think that the
technology available for Linux has lots of price/benefit potential
for Jo and employment benefit for Jon, and because I think that the
price pressure that Linux's low cost can provide will invigorate
niche markets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224e580.0x2346818"></a>Perspective</h2></div></div><p>There was a time when Linux existed, but there was no such
thing as a distribution. You had to put a Linux system together
from scratch&mdash;a few floppy images, including kermit for file
transfer, or tar to pull more files off floppies, or maybe mtools
to read DOS-format floppies. Individual binaries were available
from tsx-11.mit.edu and ftp.funet.fi. Distributions weren't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>necessary</em></span>; it really was possible to build
your own. I've done it several times. I would even consider doing
it again&mdash;for fun. But when I want it done right, I get one of the
Linux distributions and install it in a matter of minutes, or at
most hours, most of which is consumed by the computer quietly
pulling files off a CD-ROM without my assistance.</p><p>What I'm suggesting is very much like these distributions:
the basic problem already solved, ready for site-based
customization, provided in a convenient format. If you think that
is a simplistic view of the need, remember that Slackware was
created by one person who customized and bug-fixed SLS for his
friends and college professors. Although it evolved from there, and
doesn't meet everyone's Linux needs, Slackware was useful from the
start.</p><p>Many of the advertisements in <i  >Linux Journal</i> are for CD-ROMs with new versions of Linux and
Linux tools. That is important; an easily-available supply of new
tools has helped Linux spread even faster than it could over the
Internet alone. However, based on my belief that Linux is growing
and evolving, I suggest that in five more years, we will see more
and more advertisements touting Linux-based products intended to
solve a business problem, rather than impress geeks like me.</p></div></div>
