    Python is an extensible, high-level, interpreted,
    object-oriented programming language. Ready for use in the
    real world, it's also free.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x23393f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you've been programming on a Linux
system, you may be coding in C or C++. If you're a systems
administrator, you may be programming in perl, Tcl, awk, or one of
the various (sh/csh/tsh/bash) shell scripting languages. Maybe you
wrote a script to do a particular job, but now find that it doesn't
scale up very well. You might be writing C applications, but now
wish you didn't have to be bogged down in the low-level details. Or
you may simply be intrigued by the possibility of doing high-level,
object-oriented programming in a friendly, interpreted environment.
</p><p>If any of the above applies to your situation, you may be
interested in Python. Python is a powerful language for the rapid
development of applications. The interpreter is easily extensible,
and you may embed your favorite C code as a compiled extension
module.</p><p>Python is not one of the research languages which seem to get
promoted solely for pedagogical reasons. It is possible to do
useful coding almost immediately. Python seems to encourage
object-oriented programming by clearing the paths, rather than
erecting parapets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x23395b0"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>To execute the standard hello program, enter the following at
the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ python
Python 1.2 (Jun  3, 1995) [GCC 2.6.3]
Copyright 1991-1995 Sitchting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
&gt;&gt; print "hello, bruce"
hello, bruce
&gt;&gt; [CONTROL]-D
</pre><p>Most Python programs, though developed incrementally, are
executed as a normal script. The next program illustrates some
extensions to the original. The new version will identify who you
are based on your user account in /etc/passwd.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 1  #!/usr/local/bin/python
2
3  import posix
4  import string
5
6  uid = `posix.getuid()`
7  passwd = open(`/etc/passwd')
8  for line in passwd.readlines():
9      rec = string.splitfields(line, `:')
10      if rec[2] == uid:
11          print `hello', rec[0],
12          print `mind if we call you bruce?'
13          break
14  else:
15      print "I can't find you in /etc/passwd"
</pre><p>A line-by-line explanation of the program is as
follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1 --- Command interpreter to invoke</p></li><li><p>3-4 --- Import two standard Python modules,
<b  >posix</b> and <b  >regsub</b>.</p></li><li><p>6 --- Get the user id using the
<b  >posix</b> module. The enclosing backticks
(<b  >`</b>) tell Python to assign this value as a
string.</p></li><li><p>7 --- Open the /etc/passwd file in read
mode.</p></li><li><p>8 --- Start a <b  >for</b> loop, reading
in all the lines of /etc/passwd. Compound statements, such as
conditionals, have headers starting with a keyword
(<b  >if</b>, <b  >while</b>,
<b  >for</b>, <b  >try</b>) and end with a
colon.</p></li><li><p>9 --- Each line in /etc/passwd is read and split
into array <b  >rec[]</b> based on a colon
<b  >:</b> boundary, using
<b  >string.splitfields()</b></p></li><li><p>10 --- If <b  >rec[2]</b> from
/etc/passwd matches our call to <b  >posix.getuid()</b>,
we have identified the user. The first 3 fields of /etc/passwd are:
<b  >rec[0] = name</b>, <b  >rec[1] =
password</b>, and <b  >rec[2] = uid</b>.</p></li><li><p>11-12 --- Print the user's account name to stdout.
The trailing comma avoids the newline after the output.</p></li><li><p>13 --- Break the <b  >for</b>
loop.</p></li><li><p>14-15 --- Print message if we can't locate the user
in /etc/passwd.</p></li></ul></div><p>The observant reader will note that the control statements
lack any form of BEGIN/END keywords or matching braces. This is
because the indentation defines the way statements are grouped. Not
only does this eliminate the need for braces, but it enforces a
readable coding style. No doubt this design feature will turn off a
few potential Python hackers, but in practice, it is useful. I can
think of numerous times I've spent tracking bugs in C resulting
from misinterpreting code that looked like any of these fragments,
usually deeply nested:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (n == 0)
    x++;
    y--;
z++;

if (m == n || (n != o &amp;&amp; o == q)) { j++; }
    k++;
q = 0;
while (y--)
     *ptr++;
     if (m == n) {
         x++;
     }

</pre><p>A coding style enforced in the language definition would have
saved me much frustration. Python code written by another
programmer is usually very readable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x233a688"></a>Libraries</h2></div></div><p>You might object that we did a lot of work in the program
above just to demonstrate Python language features. A better method
would be to use the pwd module from the standard Python
library:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print `hello', pwd.getpwuid(posix.getuid())[0]
</pre><p>This points out another nicety about Python that is critical
for any new language's success: the robustness of its library. As
mentioned earlier, you may extend Python by adding a compiled
extension module to your personal library, but in most cases
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you don't have to</em></span>.</p><p>Take the <b  >ftplib</b> module for instance. If
you wanted to write a Python script to automatically download the
latest FAQ, you can simply use ftplib in the following
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/python
from ftplib import FTP
ftp = FTP(`ftp.python.org')     # connect to host
ftp.login()                     # login anonymous
ftp.cwd(`pub/python/doc')       # change directory
ftp.retrlines(`LIST')           # list python/doc
F = open(`python.FAQ', `w')     # file: python.FAQ
ftp.retrbinary(`RETR FAQ', F.write, 1024)
ftp.quit()
</pre><p>Python has numerous features which make programming fun and
restore your perspective of the design objectives. The language
encourages you to explore its features by writing experimental
functions during program development. Several notable Python
features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Automatic memory management. No malloc/free or
new/delete is necessary&mdash;when objects become unreachable they are
garbage-collected.</p></li><li><p>Support for manipulating lists, tuples, and
arrays</p></li><li><p>Associative arrays, referred to as &ldquo;Dictionaries&rdquo;
in Python</p></li><li><p>Modules to encourage reusability. Python comes with
a large set of standard modules that may be used as the basis for
learning to program in Python.</p></li><li><p>Exception handling</p></li><li><p>Classes</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x27330c0"></a>Python Has Real Class</h2></div></div><p>With the next example, I'll try to demonstrate some of these
features. The StackingThings class will allow the user to stack
items on top of each other until a breaking point is
reached.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>This script produces the following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
16 ton weight exceeds breaking point!
items stacked =  [`dead parrot', `spam', `spam',
     `spam', `llama']
exception: bad object not a stackable object
</pre><p>The StackingThings class itself consists of 3 methods:
<b  >_ _init_ _()</b>, <b  >add()</b>, and
<b  >test_strength()</b>. When initiating StackingThings,
we use the special <b  >__init__</b> method to create its
initial state by initializing the list of stacked items:
<b  >items_stacked = []</b>. The <b  >add()</b>
method is essentially the only method that is accessed by the user
of StackingThings. And <b  >test_strength()</b> is called
by <b  >add()</b> to verify that we have not exceeded our
breaking point.</p><p>The first argument to each method in our example is called
<b  >self</b>. This is just a convention, but it makes
our code much more readable. The first argument to a Python method
is used in a somewhat similar fashion as <b  >this</b>
keyword in C++.</p><p>Python provides for exception handling, both built-in (i.e.
<b  >ZeroDivisionError</b>, <b  >TypeError</b>,
<b  >NameError</b>, etc.) and user-defined exceptions.
The latter is especially useful in developing robust classes.
Python uses the <b  >try</b>/<b  >except</b>
syntax for exception handling:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
try:
    DenominateZero()
except ZeroDivisionError, val:
    print `Whoops:', val

</pre><p>Our <b  >add()</b> method is used to try an
exception in <b  >test_strength()</b> and raise an
exception when we pass it an illegal stacking item.</p><p>Two of the built-in methods for Python lists that are
demonstrated in the example on lines 25 and 36 are
<b  >insert()</b> and <b  >remove()</b>. Other
supported operations on list objects include
<b  >append()</b>, <b  >count()</b>,
<b  >index()</b>, <b  >reverse()</b>, and
<b  >sort()</b>.</p><p>The data attributes may be accessed by the methods of the
class as well as the user code: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Either</em></span>
<b  >print self.names</b> (within a class method)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <b  >print s.names</b> (from the
user code) will print the list of legal stacking things:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[`llama', `spam', `16 ton weight', `dead parrot']
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x2733f30"></a>Look It Up!</h2></div></div><p>Dictionaries (associative arrays to all you awk/perl hackers)
are one of the most useful Python data types. Unlike a normal
array, which is indexed by number, associative arrays are indexed
by strings. The value of this utility is worth describing in some
detail.</p><p>I frequently deal with <span   class="emphasis"><em>ICD-9-CM</em></span> codes in
medical applications. These codes are usually numeric, but
sometimes alphanumeric. They usually have a decimal point, but
sometimes don't. Some of the codes may be further sub-divided into
additional ICD-9 codes. Furthermore, codes are added and deleted
periodically, but most don't change. Normally, the lookup of ICD-9
codes will be done in a relational database, but it is also
convenient to use small data sets within an application. For
example, given the dictionaries <b  >icd9</b> and
<b  >subdivide</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   x              subdivide[x]          icd9[x]
  ---             ------------    -------------------------
  `692'                 1         `Contact dermatitis'
  `692.0'               0         `Due to detergents'
  `692.2'               0         `Due to solvents'
  `692.7'               1         `Due to solar radiation'
  `692.70'              0         `Unspecified dermatitis'
  `692.71'              0         `Sunburn'
  `692.72'              0         `Other: Photodermatitis'
</pre><p>We can manipulate the ICD-9 codes in the following
manner:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for code in icd9.keys():
  if subdivide[code]:
      print `ICD-9',code,'may be further subdivided'
        else:
      print `Description for',code,`is:',icd9[code]
</pre><p>This would produce the following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ICD-9 692.7 may be further subdivided
Description for 692.70 is: Unspecified dermatitis
Description for 692.0 is: Due to detergents
ICD-9 692 may be further subdivided
Description for 692.71 is: Sunburn
Description for 692.2 is: Due to solvents
Description for 692.72 is: Other: Photodermatitis
</pre><p>Lines 8-17 of our <b  >StackingThings</b> example
use dictionaries, but the initialization was broken into several
lines for clarity. This could be reduced to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
weights = {`llama':300, `spam':1, \
    `16 ton weight':32000, `dead parrot':2}
breakpt = {`llama':200, `spam':1000, \
    `16 ton weight':1000000, `dead parrot':15}

</pre><p>Finally, inheritance is provided in Python, although it is
not demonstrated in this example. The derived class may override
methods of its base class or classes (yes, multiple inheritance is
supported in a limited form). In C++ parlance, all methods in a
Python class are &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x27344b0"></a>Where Do We Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>Python is currently available in source or as a Linux binary
from ftp.python.org. Various modules have already been developed
and become part of the standard Python Library. To mention just a
few: support for strings, regular expressions, posix, sockets,
threads, multimedia, cryptography, STDWIN, Internet/WWW, Expect,
and a large number of other contributions, are submitted
periodically.</p><p>Python is extensible. If you can program in C, you can add a
new low-level module to the interpreter. We are currently doing
this at our company for a distributed database system. The Python
interpreter will be the high-level command language for many of the
applications.</p><p>In addition to Linux, Python runs on several other platforms:
OS/2, Windows, Macintosh, and many flavors of Unix. And like Linux,
all of these versions are freely available and
distributable.</p><p>The documentation for Python is of a very high quality,
written by Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python. Four separate
user manuals in postscript format are available at the Python ftp
site (see sidebar <a href="1121s1.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Python
Information&rdquo;</a>). These documents have also been converted to
HTML and Microsoft help file formats. A Python FAQ, quick reference
guide, and testimonials are also available. O'Reilly and Associates
also intends to publish <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Python</em></span>
early next year.</p><p>Python has its own active newsgroup (comp.lang.python) as
well as a mailing list which receives the same messages as the
newsgroup. To subscribe to the mailing list, send mail to
<a href="mailto:python-list-request@cwi.nl">python-list-request@cwi.nl</a>.
Various Python special interest groups have been formed:
Matrix-SIG, GUI-SIG, and Locator-SIG.</p><p>Finally, The Python Software Activity (&ldquo;PSA&rdquo;) has been
established to foster the common interests of the Python
development community. The PSA, unlike the GNU Project, does not do
the actual development of software (although many of its members
probably do), but rather acts as a clearinghouse for Python
software modules developed by others. It also hosts workshops and
related activities to help promote the use of the Python language.
Additional information about the PSA may be obtained by visiting
the Python home page:
