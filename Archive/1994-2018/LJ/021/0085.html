</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Publisher:</b></span>
Springer-Verlag</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 0-387-94506-7</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $34.95</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> Christopher
Boscolo</p><p>While perusing the Linux section of a local book store, I ran
across <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span>. The teasers on the back
of the book describe a 32-bit multi-user/multitasking UNIX system
that runs directly from a CD-ROM. They also mention: easy access to
the Internet, a graphical administration tool, and ELF file format.
At first, I thought this was yet another Linux book accompanied by
existing Linux distributions on CD-ROM. However, I discovered that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span> was a completely new
distribution. The book is actually an installation guide with some
reference material tacked on to the end.</p><p>It is not clear which type of user <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Universe</em></span> is targeting. The professional-looking install
program and GUI administration tool would seem to indicate a target
audience of beginner to intermediate users. For this reason, I paid
special attention to ease of use and clarity of the
documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b7580.0x22af978"></a>What Is Included</h2></div></div><p>The book contains 7 chapters of installation instructions, a
reference, and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span> CD-ROM.
Chapters 1-3 contain an introduction and system requirements
information, while chapters 4-6 cover the installation and
configuration. Chapter 7 describes how to use the GUI
administration tool, and the purpose of system directories such as
/etc and /var. The last section of the book is a reference
containing UNIX command descriptions. However, the book was by no
means a complete reference to configuring a Linux system.</p><p>Linux Universe uses System V style startup scripts, (i.e.,
rc1.d, rc2.d...). It also uses the new ELF format executables. The
1.2.0 kernel that is installed includes support for most hardware.
It includes X11R6 and most of the popular utilities found in other
distributions.</p><p>One area where the Linux Universe distribution seems to fall
short is in telecommunications and Internet access. Although the
book mentions easy Internet access, I could not find Netscape or
Mosaic, and PPP support is not compiled into the kernel. [Licensing
restrictions make it difficult to put Mosaic and Netscape on a
CD&mdash;ED]</p><p>Two Linux Universe utilities make it shine as a potential
commercial distribution: the Boot Manager and xadmin. Linux
Universe uses its own OS loader instead of LILO. The Linux Universe
boot manager is probably the best boot manager I have used. Its 3D
looking text interface displays a countdown while booting, and
allows you to interrupt it. You can also change what and how you
want to boot on the fly. This allowed me to add a configuration to
boot my previous Linux version without having to reboot with the
new configuration.</p><p>The second great utility is xadmin. xadmin is a wishx
application that allows you to configure almost every aspect of
your Linux system. With xadmin, I added an account for myself, and
configured the file system to mount my previous Linux version and
my MS DOS partition. xadmin can also be used to configure network
information, modem ports, printing, and to change system settings
such as time/date. Another nice feature of xadmin is the package
install/uninstall. The Linux Universe distribution treats
applications such as emacs or the Ada compiler as packages that can
be installed and uninstalled through xadmin. One difficulty was
determining which features, such as man pages, were in which
packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b7580.0x22afc38"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>I wish I could say that the installation was a breeze, but I
ran into several snags. The Linux Universe distribution ships only
on a CD-ROM, with no floppy disk to do a fresh install. This means
you must have DOS or Linux already installed. Although this is
common for most distributions, it is handy to have an install disk.
First I tried to use the DOS application which starts the Linux
install program. This attempt failed due to lack of conventional
memory, even though I had over 500KB available, which is what the
documentation indicates is required. The only way I could free up
some more conventional memory was to remove my DOS CD-ROM
drivers... do you see the problem here? The alternative was to use
rawrite.exe to write a Linux Universe installation boot floppy,
which worked fine.</p><p>With the boot floppy made, I rebooted and was greeted with
the Boot Manager, which then fired up Linux and the
professional-looking install application. One nice feature of the
installation process was the ability to tell the installer where to
find Linux Universe installation sources. Along with the choices
for different CD-ROM types was the choice of an NFS file system.
The book describes the steps of installing Linux Universe from
choosing the keyboard type to setting up X-Windows. One complaint
about the documentation was that it says to create a swap partition
but does not describe how. I also had a problem with the X-Windows
installation. The installation program has you select a mouse and
mouse port, but when X-Windows came up, the mouse was not
configured properly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b7580.0x22afd98"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Configuring the system after it booted was fairly simple,
again because of xadmin. The installation book suggests rebuilding
the kernel after rebooting, which I needed to do anyway, as I
wanted PPP support. However, the book did not mention which
packages needed to be installed to build the kernel. After
installing the compiler and the assembler, I had to fix some of the
links to header files used by kernel sources. With the kernel
rebuilt I set up PPP and used xadmin to configure my network
information with no problems.</p><p>I configured Linux Universe to use XDM. When the system
booted, the root window displayed a commercial looking Linux
Universe Logo. The default xsession is also set up well. It uses
fvwm, and comes up with a utility toolbar down the right side of
the screen. Using Linux Universe with the defaults for the user I
created went smoothly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b7580.0x22afef8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>It is difficult to see exactly which sets of users benefit
the most from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span>. For beginners,
it's is probably not the right choice. The snags during
installation and the lack of hard bound documentation would be
overwhelming. For beginners I would recommend a more &ldquo;plug and
play&rdquo; distribution, such as Yggdrasil. For the intermediate to
expert users, or users looking for easy Internet access, I would
stick to other distributions as well, such as Slackware.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span> seems best suited for an
intermediate user who wants an easily administered Linux system,
but is knowledgeable enough to handle problems when they
arise.</p></div></div>
