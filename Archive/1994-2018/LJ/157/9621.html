Lock down access to SSH with Single Packet Authorization.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x14522f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, in the first of a two-part series, I described the theory
behind the next generation in passive authentication technologies called
Single Packet Authorization (SPA). This article gets away from theory and
concentrates on the practical application of SPA with fwknop and iptables to
protect SSHD from reconnaissance and attack. With this setup on a Linux
system, no one will be able to tell that SSHD is even listening under an nmap
scan, and only authenticated and authorized clients will be able to
communicate with SSHD.
</p><p>
To begin, we require some information about configuration and network
architecture. This article assumes you have installed the latest version
of fwknop (1.0.1 at the time of this writing) on the same system where SSHD and
iptables are running. You can download fwknop from
<a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop" target="_self">www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop</a> and install either from the source tar
archive by running the install.pl script or via the RPM for RPM-based Linux distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1452500"></a>
Network Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The basic network depicted in Figure 1 illustrates our setup. The fwknop
client is executed on the host labeled spa_client (15.1.1.1), and the
fwknop server (along with iptables) runs on the system labeled spa_server
(16.2.2.2). A malicious system is labeled attacker (18.3.3.3), which is able to
sniff all traffic between the spa_client and spa_server systems.

Figure 1. Sample Scenario Where You Use SPA to Protect SSH Communications
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x14527c0"></a>
Default-Drop iptables Policy</h2></div></div><p>
The spa_client system has the IP address 15.1.1.1, and the spa_server system
has the IP address 16.2.2.2. On the spa_server system, iptables is configured to
provide basic connectivity services for the internal network
(192.168.10.0/24) and to log and drop all attempts (via the iptables LOG and DROP targets) from
the external network to connect to any service on the firewall itself. This
policy is quite simplistic, and it is meant to show only that the firewall does
not advertise any services (including SSHD) under an nmap scan. Any serious
deployment of iptables for a real network would be significantly more
complicated. One important feature to note, however, is that the connection
tracking facilities provided by Netfilter are used to keep state in the iptables
policy. The end result is that connections initiated through the firewall (via
the FORWARD chain) and to the firewall (via the INPUT chain) remain open
without additional ACCEPT rules to allow packets required to keep the
connections established (such as TCP acknowledgements and the like). The iptables
policy is built with the following basic firewall.sh script:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_server]# cat firewall.sh
#!/bin/sh
IPTABLES=/sbin/iptables
$IPTABLES -F
$IPTABLES -F -t nat
$IPTABLES -X
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -m state --state
 &#8618;ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -m state --state
 &#8618;ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s
 &#8618;192.168.10.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -i ! lo -j LOG --log-prefix
 &#8618;"DROP "
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -i ! lo -j DROP
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i ! lo -j LOG --log-prefix
 &#8618;"DROP "
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i ! lo -j DROP
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo "[+] iptables policy activated"
exit
[spa_server]# ./firewall.sh
[+] iptables policy activated</pre><p>
With iptables active, it is time to see what remote access we might have.
From the spa_client system, we use nmap to see if SSHD is accessible on the
spa_server system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_client]$  nmap -P0 -sT -p 22 16.2.2.2

Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
at 2007-02-09 23:55 EST
Interesting ports on 16.2.2.2:
PORT   STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp filtered ssh

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in
12.009 seconds</pre><p>
As expected, iptables is blocking all attempts to communicate with SSHD, and
the remaining ports (both TCP and UDP) are similarly protected by the iptables
policy. It does not matter if an attacker has a zero-day exploit for the
particular version of OpenSSH that is deployed on the spa_server system; all
attempts to communicate up the stack are being blocked by iptables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1452a28"></a>
fwknop SPA Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Confident that iptables is protecting the local network with a Draconian
stance, it is time to configure the fwknop server d&aelig;mon (fwknopd)
on the spa_server system. The file /etc/fwknop/fwknop.conf controls
important configuration parameters, such as the interface on which fwknopd
sniffs traffic via libpcap, the e-mail address(es) to which fwknopd sends
informational alerts and the pcap filter statement designed to sniff SPA
packets off the wire. By default, fwknop sends SPA packets over UDP port
62201, so the pcap filter statement in /etc/fwknop/fwknop.conf is set to
<tt  >udp port 62201</tt> by default. However, SPA packets
can be sent over any port and protocol (even over ICMP), but the filter
statement would need to be updated to handle SPA communications over other
port/protocols. More information can be found in the fwknop man page.
Although the defaults in this file usually make sense for most
deployments, you may need to tweak the PCAP_INTF and EMAIL_ADDRESSES variables
for your particular setup.
</p><p>
The /etc/fwknop/access.conf file is the most important fwknopd
configuration file&mdash;it manages the encryption keys and access control rights
used to validate SPA packets from fwknop clients. The following access.conf
file is used for the remainder of this article:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_server]# cat /etc/fwknop/access.conf
SOURCE: ANY;
OPEN_PORTS: tcp/22;
FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT: 30;
KEY: LJ07p2rbga;
GPG_DECRYPT_ID: ABCD1234;
GPG_DECRYPT_PW: p2atc1l30p;
GPG_REMOTE_ID: 5678DEFG;
GPG_HOME_DIR: /root/.gnupg;</pre><p>
The SOURCE variable defines the IP addresses from which fwknopd accepts SPA packets. The value ANY shown above is a wild card to examine SPA packets from
any IP address, but it can be restricted to specific IP addresses or subnets,
and comma-separated lists are supported (for example, 192.168.10.0/24, 15.1.1.1).
The OPEN_PORTS variable informs fwknopd about the set of ports that should be
opened upon receiving a valid SPA packet; in this case, fwknopd will open TCP
port 22.
</p><p>
Although not shown above, fwknopd can be configured to allow the
fwknop client to dictate the set of ports to open by including the
PERMIT_CLIENT_PORTS variable and setting it to Y. FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT
specifies the length of time that an ACCEPT rule is added to the iptables
policy to allow the traffic defined by the OPEN_PORTS variable. Because the
iptables policy in the firewall.sh script above makes use of the connection
tracking capabilities provided by Netfilter, an SSH connection will remain
established after the initial ACCEPT rule is deleted by fwknopd.
</p><p>
The remaining variables define parameters for the encryption and
decryption of SPA packets. This article illustrates the usage of both
symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, but only one encryption style is required by
fwknop.
</p><p>
All of the GPG_* variables can be omitted if there is a KEY variable
and vice versa. The KEY variable defines a shared key between the fwknop
client and fwknopd server. This key is used to encrypt/decrypt the SPA packet
with the Rijndael symmetric block cipher (see Resources). For asymmetric encryption,
GPG_DECRYPT_ID defines the local fwknopd server GnuPG key ID. This key is
used by the fwknop client to encrypt SPA packets via an encryption algorithm
supported by GnuPG (such as the ElGamal cipher).
</p><p>
GPG_DECRYPT_PW is the decryption password associated with the fwknopd
server key. Because this password is placed within the access.conf file
in clear text, it is not recommended to use a valuable GnuPG key for the
server; a dedicated key should be generated for the purpose of decrypting
SPA packets. The fwknop clients sign SPA packets with a GnuPG key on
the local key ring, and the password is supplied by the user from the
command line and never stored within a file (as we will see below). Hence,
any GnuPG key can be used by the fwknop client; even a valuable key used
for encrypting sensitive e-mail communications, for example.
</p><p>
The GPG_REMOTE_ID variable defines a list of key IDs that the
fwknopd server will accept. Any SPA packet encrypted with the fwknopd
server public key must be signed with a private key specified by
the GPG_REMOTE_ID variable. This allows fwknopd to restrict the set
of people who can gain
access to a protected service (SSHD in our case) via a cryptographically
strong mechanism. Instructions
for creating GnuPG keys for use with fwknop can be found at
<a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/gpghowto.html" target="_self">www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/gpghowto.html</a>.
</p><p>
With the /etc/fwknop/access.conf file built, it is time to start fwknopd
on the spa_server system and put fwknop to work for us:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_server]# /etc/init.d/fwknop start
 * Starting fwknop ...                      [ ok ]</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1452fa8"></a>
SPA via Symmetric Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
On the spa_client system, we use fwknop to build an SPA packet encrypted
via Rijndael and send it on its way to the spa_server system. We want access
to SSHD, and the -A argument below encodes the desired access within the SPA
packet. The -w argument resolves the IP address of the client system by
querying http://www.whatismyip.com (this is useful if the fwknop client is
behind a NAT device), the -k argument is the IP address of the destination
SPA server, and -v runs in verbose mode so we can view the raw packet data:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_client]$ fwknop -A tcp/22 -w -k 16.2.2.2 -v
[+] Starting fwknop in client mode.
    Resolving external IP via: http://www.whatismyip.com/

[+] Enter an encryption key. This key must match a key
    in the file /etc/fwknop/access.conf on the remote system.

[+] Sending 150 byte message to 16.2.2.2 over udp/62201...</pre><p>
As you can see from the Packet data section above, the SPA packet is a
completely unintelligible blob of encrypted data. On the spa_server system,
the following syslog message is generated indicating that an ACCEPT rule has
been added for the source IP (15.1.1.1) that generated the SPA packet.
Note that the source IP is put within the SPA packet by the fwknop
client. In this
case, the SPA packet was not spoofed, so the real source address and
the
source address embedded in the SPA packet match. SPA packets can be
spoofed by
fwknop with the <tt  >--Spoof-src</tt> command-line argument
(requires root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">Feb 10 13:55:44 spa_server fwknopd: received valid Rijndael \
encrypted packet from: 15.1.1.1, remote user: mbr
Feb 10 13:55:44 spa_server fwknopd: adding FWKNOP_INPUT ACCEPT \
rule for 15.1.1.1 -&gt; tcp/22 (30 seconds)</pre><p>
So, for 30 seconds after sending the SPA packet, the iptables policy on the
spa_server allows the spa_client system to establish an SSH session:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_client]$ ssh -l mbr 16.2.2.2
mbr@spa_server's password:</pre><p>
After 30 seconds has expired, knoptm (a d&aelig;mon responsible for
deleting iptables rules added by fwknopd to the iptables policy) deletes the
ACCEPT rule and writes the following messages to syslog:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Feb 10 13:52:17 spa_server knoptm: removed iptables \
FWKNOP_INPUT ACCEPT rule for 15.1.1.1 -&gt; tcp/22, \
30 second timeout exceeded</pre><p>
Our SSH session remains established after the ACCEPT rule is deleted because
of the state tracking rules in the iptables policy (see the firewall.sh
script above). These rules allow packets that are part of an established TCP
connection to pass unimpeded.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1453478"></a>
SPA via Asymmetric Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
To use GnuPG to encrypt and sign an SPA packet, you can execute the fwknop
command below. In this case, the key ID of the fwknopd server is specified on
the command line with the --gpg-recipient argument, and the key ID used to
sign the SPA packet is given with the --gpg-signing-key argument (the output
below has been abbreviated):</p><pre     class="programlisting">[spa_client]$ fwknop -A tcp/22 --gpg-recipient ABCD1234 \
--gpg-signing-key 5678DEFG -w -k 16.2.2.2

[+] Sending 1010 byte message to 16.2.2.2 over udp/62201</pre><p>
As you can see, the length of the application portion of the SPA packet has
increased to more than 1,000 bytes, whereas it was only 150 bytes for the
Rijndael example. This is because the key length of GnuPG keys (in this case
2,048 bits) and the characteristics of asymmetric ciphers tend to inflate the
size of small chunks of data after being encrypted. There is no strict
correspondence between the size of clear-text and cipher-text data as in block
ciphers such as Rijndael.
</p><p>
Again, on the spa_server system, fwknop adds the ACCEPT rule for us. This
time fwknopd reports that the SPA packet is encrypted with GnuPG, and that a
valid signature for the required key ID 5678DEFG is found:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Feb 10 14:38:26 spa_server fwknopd: received valid GnuPG
encrypted packet (signed with required key ID: "5678DEFG")
from: 15.1.1.1, remote user: mbr
Feb 10 14:38:26 spa_server fwknopd: adding
FWKNOP_INPUT ACCEPT rule for 15.1.1.1 -&gt; tcp/22 (30 seconds)</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1453790"></a>
Thwarting a Replay Attack</h2></div></div><p>
Suppose that the SPA packet from the first example above was sniffed off
the wire en route by a crafty individual on the system labeled attacker in
the network diagram in Figure 1. The SPA packet always can be placed back on
the wire in an effort to gain the same access as the original
packet&mdash;this is
known as a replay attack. There are several ways to acquire the packet data
and replay it. One of the most common is to use tcpdump to write a pcap file
(in this case <tt  >tcpdump -i eth0 -l -nn -s 0 -w SPA.pcap port
62201</tt> would work)
and then use tcpreplay (see <a href="http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac" target="_self">tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac</a>) to copy the SPA
packet back onto the wire. Another method, after the packet has been
captured,
is to use the echo command along with netcat:</p><pre     class="programlisting">[attacker]$ echo "U2FsdGVkX1+BvzxXj5Zv6gvfCFXwJ+iJGKP \
qe2whdYzyigkerSp2WtvON/xTd8t6V6saxbg1v4zsK+YNt53BE8EI \
nxVCgpD7y/gEBIg8sd+AvU1ekQh9vwJJduseVx \
DxjmAHx3oNnClo2wckBqd8zA" |nc -u 16.2.2.2 62201</pre><p>
On the fwknopd server, the duplicate SPA packet is monitored, but because the
MD5 sum matches that of the original SPA packet, no access is granted, and the
following message is written to syslog on the spa_server system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Feb 10 14:14:24 spa_server fwknopd: attempted \
message replay from: 18.3.3.3</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135a580.0x1453a50"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Single Packet Authorization provides an additional layer of security for
services such as SSHD, and this layer strikes at the first step that an
attacker must accomplish when trying to compromise a system: reconnaissance.
By using iptables in a default-drop stance and fwknop to sniff the wire for
specially constructed (that is, encrypted and non-replayed) packets, it is
difficult even to tell that a service is listening, let alone communicate
with it. The end result is that it is significantly harder to exploit any
vulnerabilities a protected service might have.
