Coraid's SR1521T EtherDrive Network Storage Tower</h2></div></div><p>
The Coraid folks have released a free-standing tower version of their
EtherDrive Storage Appliance, christened the SR1521T. The SR1521T,
with internal RAID, provides true networked storage over standard
Ethernet and is based on the open ATA over Ethernet (AoE) protocol.
Coraid says that &ldquo;AoE is a block level storage protocol that is simpler to
implement than other SAN technologies and at considerably less cost than
iSCSI and Fibre Channel solutions.&rdquo; Further, because AoE is non-routed,
&ldquo;the need for TCP/IP processing overhead or expensive network
adapters&rdquo;
is eliminated. The target customers are those that do not seek
a rackmounted solution and &ldquo;that need powerful and scalable network
storage readily available at the departmental level&rdquo;. The AoE protocol
is native in the Linux 2.6 kernel, and software drivers are available
for Mac OS X, Windows, Solaris and FreeBSD.

Arcosoft's VONaLink TeamRecord</h2></div></div><p>
Arcosoft joins the growing list of companies that have come to their
senses: it just released a Linux version of its VONaLink TeamRecord
VoIP-based call-recording application. TeamRecord works with any VoIP
phone system based on the SIP standard (think Asterisk), centrally
recording all phone calls for a company's workgroup. VONaLink says that
TeamRecord, for instance, allows &ldquo;business transactions over the phone
to be verified and disputes resolved&rdquo; or comply with Sarbanes-Oxley or
other disclosure provisions. Furthermore, TeamRecord replaces both
expensive analog recording equipment and proprietary products from
the dreaded phone company. The recording process involves unobtrusive
monitoring of network packets via the port mirroring capability of a
network switch and results in an inaudibly watermarked MP3 or WAV file.
Users can listen to recordings of their own calls from a Web browser.
TeamRecord is available for x86 Linux and Windows platforms.

ActiveState's Komodo Edit</h2></div></div><p>
ActiveState recently released its new version 4.0 of Komodo Edit, the
firm's free, multilanguage editor for dynamic languages. Based on
ActiveState's Komodo IDE 4.0, Komodo Edit not only supports Perl,
PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl, but also client-side languages and Ajax
technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML and XML. OS support
includes Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Among the product's advantages,
says ActiveState, are capability additions via .xpi extensions, storage of
configurable elements (such as run commands, macros, code snippets and so
on),
syntax checking and coloring, an active community site and more. A
gratis download of Komodo Edit is available from ActiveState's Web site.

Dyne.org's dyne:bolic Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
When not spending time in Amsterdam's offbeat caf&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;, the members
of Dyne.org are busy developing dyne:bolic, upgraded to version
2.4, a live-or-installed Linux distribution focused on the needs of
media-production fanatics. The main advantages of dyne:bolic include
recognition of a wide variety of devices and peripherals, numerous
tools for recording, editing, encoding and streaming audio and video,
and the ability to run on lower-powered hardware. New in version 2.4
are improved user-friendliness via the Xfce-4.4 desktop, encrypted nests
for preventing access to personal data stored in home directories, new
(QParted) and updated (Cinelerra) software and a modularization of the
inclusion of different kernels. You also can run (the previous edition
of) dyne:bolic on &ldquo;modded Xbox game consoles&rdquo; and even cluster them!
Raw ISO CD images can be downloaded for free or purchased for a minimal
cost.

Avocent's MergePoint 5224 and 5240 Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
Two new arrows in Avocent's quiver are the MergePoint 5224 and 5240,
appliances for controlling the service processors found in nearly any
server. Service processors help manage servers independently of the
main processor, controlling such functions as power, hardware monitoring
and alerts. With its MergePoint appliances, Avocent claims to be the first
company to &ldquo;enable IT administrators to manage multiple service processors
in Windows, Linux and UNIX servers from a single console&rdquo;, leveraging the
&ldquo;embedded management capabilities of servers already in their
network&rdquo;.
Product advantages include the ability to manage and control nearly
all types of service processors (DRAC, iLO and RSA II) with a single
gateway; increased efficiency through the unified utilization of service
processors; reduced costs via consolidation of service-processor Ethernet
ports; and added security through authentication, authorization and
accounting features.

No Starch Press Titles</h2></div></div><p>
Here's the deal. Right now, No Starch Press is giving life to so many
great titles, I'm not completely sure which single title will
bring you the most geek enlightenment. So, let's give the coolest ones
some abridged love, shall we? First, there's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Appliance
Design</em></span> by Bob Smith, John Hardin, Graham Phillips and Bill Pierce.
Although many books tell readers how to run Linux on embedded hardware
or how to build a Linux application, No Starch says this is the first
title to demonstrate how to merge the two to create a Linux appliance.
The CD includes a prototype appliance&mdash;a home alarm system&mdash;that readers
can use and modify. Next up, because we know many of you do BSD, there's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel
Hacking</em></span> by Joseph Kong.
Written in a cheeky style with lots of geek humor, the book covers the
fundamentals of programming and developing rootkits under the FreeBSD
operating system. Finally, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Book of Qt 4</em></span> by Daniel Molkentin, a
core KDE developer, shows readers how to build applications both with
and without Qt's graphical GUI builder, Qt Designer.

Sun Microsystem's OpenDocument Format (ODF) Plugin for Microsoft
Office</h2></div></div><p>
Monopolists need tools like this to keep them honest. You can now
download Sun's plugin application for Microsoft Office 2003
that will allow for &ldquo;seamless two-way conversion of Microsoft Word's
documents to and from ODF&rdquo;. At the time of this writing, support for spreadsheets and presentations
is due in April 2007. The conversion is claimed to be fully transparent
to the user. Might this be the end of the beginning of the end of the

BakBone Software's NetVault: Backup APM for MySQL</h2></div></div><p>
Database admins should note that BakBone Software has released the new
NetVault: Backup APM for MySQL, version 3.0. The solution provides low-complexity
deployment and protection of the MySQL Enterprise and Community editions,
consolidated backup and recovery and a common administrative UI that
allows users to set up, configure and define a wide range of backup
policies and scenarios. Additional highlights include full, incremental
and differential backups while data is on-line and accessible; a common
UI across multiple storage engines; consolidation of multiple storage
engines into a single job; and protection down to the table level.
The product is a MySQL Enterprise Gold Certified solution.
