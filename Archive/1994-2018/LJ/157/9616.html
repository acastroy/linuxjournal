Media Centre.

Sometimes I like to get back to UpFront stories that deserve more than
the few inches they get the first time around. Such was the case with
the news that the Manitoba Media Centre (<a href="http://manitobamediacentre.org" target="_self">manitobamediacentre.org</a>), a
new &ldquo;Open Source Entertainment Engineering, Innovation, and Production
Research Facility&rdquo; in Winnipeg, was already funded for seven figures
with plans to push that number up to eight [see Doc's story in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>'s March
2007 UpFront section]. I got to thinking...&ldquo;Why so
much money? And, why Manitoba?&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, I began corresponding with Michael Collins, the CEO of Linux Media
Arts (LMA) and the prime mover behind the project. Veteran
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
readers who followed Robin Rowe's coverage of Linux Hollywood
Domination may recall Robin's encounter
with Michael at the 2001 NAB
(National Association of Broadcasters) show, where Michael said, &ldquo;Our
goal is to make Linux the premier multimedia editing and media
production platform in the world, largely using open-source
software&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4743" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4743</a>).
The next year, Robin reviewed LMA's Broadcast 2000 nonlinear editor
(NLE)&mdash;a product that has since been succeeded by Cinelerra
(<a href="http://cinelerra.org" target="_self">cinelerra.org</a>), a Linux-based 64-bit open-source
editing system, which, at last check, had around 700,000 search results
on Google. Although
this was a Linux Movie Mojo story on its own right, LMA's Manitoba move
seemed too interesting to ignore. So, I decided to interview Michael,
with interesting results. Read on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What got the Manitoba Media Centre going?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: The concept for an Open Source Research and Development facility in
Manitoba was first considered three years ago at the IBC show in
Amsterdam. I made plans to meet up with a colleague from Winnipeg with
whom I had been collaborating remotely in the design of a high-definition
video board. His name is Jos&eacute; A. Rueda. Jos&eacute; is an
experienced multimedia systems engineer with a PhD in Electrical and
Computer Engineering and an MBA. Jos&eacute; had a good understanding of the
business side of media engineering and open source, and he was very willing
to collaborate. Jos&eacute; spoke glowingly about Manitoba's technological and
financial resources and its highly stable professional
population&mdash;something lacking in other regions. So, it looked to me like Manitoba
might be a perfect R&amp;D climate, and I kept that in the back of my mind
while we moved forward with various other projects.
</p><p>
Then, business prospects rose dramatically, and with them the need for
good R&amp;D. So, last spring, I called up Jos&eacute; to discuss establishing an
R&amp;D facility for LMA in Winnipeg. Then, I flew to Winnipeg in
August for a four-day trip to meet with Jos&eacute; and a few of his colleagues
from business and government. Jos&eacute;  who is very well respected in
Manitoba business and political circles, took me around town to meet
with numerous people from the public and private sectors. We first met
with Edward Suzuki of Destination Winnipeg, the economic development
agency for the city of Winnipeg, and he was very keen in helping us and
assisting us plan my itinerary for the meetings in my first visit and my
future visits. We also met with John Clarkson, who is the Deputy
Minister for Science, Technology, Energy, and Mines in the Provincial
Government of Manitoba.
</p><p>
I laid out a vision for a worldwide center for open-source media
technologies. John Clarkson was very curious, supportive and perceptive,
and he surprised me at the end of the meeting by mentioning that the
Premier of Manitoba, Gary Doer, was very interested in alliances with
technology companies based in California. He said the Premier was
scheduled for a trip to Los Angeles in a few weeks' time and might be
interested in discussing the concept further.
</p><p>
A few weeks later, I got an e-mail from John telling me the Premier
wanted to visit our Burbank offices and wanted me to present our vision
directly to him. So, Mr Doer came accompanied by John Clarkson, and I
laid out my vision for a research center in Winnipeg that took advantage
of the professional engineering population and the supportive business
community in Manitoba.
</p><p>
A week later, we heard back that the Premier wished to go forward with
the concept. So, I took two more trips to Winnipeg to determine the
project's viability and to make plans for its eventuality. Jos&eacute; and I
continued to meet with those interested in the financing, support and
professional requirements for building a facility from scratch.
Eventually, we came up with a viable plan and decided to announce the
Manitoba Media Centre (MMC), along with the initial $20 million investment, on
December 15, 2006, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you say who the investors are?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: I can say that Linux Media Arts is devoting $5 million in current
revenues to the Centre to jump-start development endeavors. The rest is
coming from a combination of investments from the province and from
regional interests in Manitoba. The multimillion-dollar investment will
enable us to engage in business opportunities and relationships that
were not available to us before.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What projects are you starting out with?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: LMA has a number of complete systems architecture projects in-house
right now. We will be hiring employees and contributors of the MMC to
support key technology development. Additionally, the MMC will support
technical development where markets currently exist and are not being
properly supported by the industry, in our opinion.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are some of those markets?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Our focus is on larger markets such as broadcasting and film
production systems engineering projects, particularly in Asia. Wherever
people want their open-source multimedia project to be developed to a
professional standard, we can help. Our engineering staff is very
experienced. We have PhDs with qualifications from the largest
media engineering and media production companies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ: What do you expect to see coming out of the
Centre?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: We expect to see the MMC become a worldwide leader in open-source
development technologies, where a full-time staff will support research
and development, and technologists will come to the Centre from all
around the world. In fact, we intend to participate at NAB in April 2007. We
also intend to host a three-day conference in Winnipeg in fall 2007.
</p><p>
In addition, we have plans to build a multimedia production centre for
the Misipawistik Cree Nation in Manitoba. Users will be able to record
and produce programming for the Internet, cable and satellite distribution.
</p><p>
We are also assisting in the development of a curriculum based on open-source media applications for the Red River College in Winnipeg. We are
collaborating with the University of Manitoba Experimental Media
Centre as well.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are some of the technologies you're talking about
here?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Archiving, indexing, restoration, telecine and media distribution.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Let's look at the big Linux development picture and put these in
context. Right now, the LAMP stack has grown to more than 140,000 components,
if we look at the list of projects on SourceForge alone. What's still
missing there for multimedia?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: In our opinion, what's missing is a professional perspective with
the finishing touch and polish necessary to get professional attention.
Open-source media applications and systems have to be better to achieve
a larger reach in a competitive and dynamic market.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: In the December 2006 announcement, you said the MMC would work on
&ldquo;an Open
Source Media Distribution Operating System&rdquo;. Is Linux not already
that?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Of course it is. However, what we intend to do is to release it
strictly from the perspective of what is important to multimedia users.
In other words, tool and applications and kernel changes that will
improve the media experience.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you be more specific about kernel changes?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Well, we stick pretty closely to what Red Hat and SUSE have been
distributing for 64-bit architectures on the 2.6 kernel. The changes we
make in the release and device drivers are more applicable to unique
video cards, video networking devices, moving large files and adherence
to SMPTE protocols. We also find it advantageous to remove some of the
options for a typical production worker who is using a system as an
appliance. Also, in streamlining the size and scope of the release, it
tends to pick up speed, and this is also important for moving video frames.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are some examples of archival and indexing tools or other open-source multimedia applications?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: MXF is a metadata-based archiving tool that is open source. We're
also talking about many compression technologies, which have the ability
to place indexable wrappers on them.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Will there be efforts to carry forward existing open-source
multimedia apps that are already out there?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Absolutely. There are numerous examples that will be included with
the distribution. In particular, we expect to finally bring the promise
of Cinelerra to fruition for professional markets on a wide scale.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How is Cinelerra doing?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Cinelerra continues to be developed by its originator and main
developer Adam Williams, and supported by an active open-source team
from all over the world. Nothing proprietary will be implemented in
Cinelerra on our watch. But, it will soon become clear that Cinelerra
will compete favorably and beat the biggest names in the business. That
is one of the main goals of the Manitoba Media Centre. We want to bring
Cinelerra into its rightful place as a superior media software
application that lives up to its original vision: to change how we edit
and tell stories with video.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: I see Cinelerra is GPL'd. Will the Manitoba Media Centre work to
make other developments GPL'd as well?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Absolutely. We have been very successful in developing and
implementing GPL software on consulting contracts. We intend to devote a
great deal of effort developing and promoting GPL software.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How will the development communities work? Who will keep the code
repositories?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Like other communities, these will attract contributors who have a
stake in what the code will do. And, that's in addition to the
professionals we're hiring to work on the code as well. Both the code
and the repositories will be located on our servers in Winnipeg and
mirrored elsewhere.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How is Linux progressing in Hollywood in general? Can we expect to
see proprietary solutions increasingly replaced?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Oh, yes. Linux continues to be high on the development agendas of
numerous major studios. Current integrations are usually with in-house
solutions. We expect efforts such as the MMC to change that by making
more professional tools available on the open market for everybody.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How will it change your business in particular?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Soon we'll be announcing a motion picture with a major Hollywood
star to be shot entirely in Manitoba by a Canadian director and
produced in collaboration with our team using our media production
systems. All of our media solutions will be involved from pre-production
to production to post-production to distribution. We can even provide
the systems to project the film at an electronic cinema.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Let's look at developments on the demand side of the market, where
more consumers are becoming producers, and the quality of digital goods
is moving toward what you pros call &ldquo;cine&rdquo; quality. What's the biggest
step for getting us there?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: Cheaper 1080p cameras, cheaper lenses and affordable easy-to-use tools.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How soon do you think 1080p shooting and production will be within
reach of amateurs and low-budget independent moviemakers?</b></span>
</p><p>
MC: It's already within the reach of people willing to take a
professional approach to their production. In other words, it's very
much in reach of the first adopters from a financial perspective. &ldquo;The
typical amateur&rdquo; includes so many different types of people that we're
bound to see lots of good work. To do that work, they'll find that
software and systems are in place right now. The most expensive part of
the production is the capture end, meaning the camera. After that, it's a
storage issue. If you want to take it to film, then those are additional
costs. It is expensive, but it's not impossible, as it was just a few
years ago. If you want to have something professional for a film
festival or even for distribution, you can do it.
