Zimbra exploits Ajax for a compelling Web groupware experience.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fc348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
E-mail is the backbone of modern corporate communication, and frankly,
it has been for a long time. As with any tool that gets this much use and
features so prominently in any networked business, e-mail has demonstrated
a host of limitations. To improve the experience, software developers
have integrated certain obvious functions, such as calendaring, simple
mailing lists and address books, thereby creating what is popularly
referred to as a contact management system.
</p><p>
The great leap for enterprise contact management was the creation
of groupware, or collaboration tools, allowing those calendars and contact
lists to be shared among members of an organization. Administering
complex packages on thousands of personal computer desktops creates
its own set of problems though. As these increasingly complex systems grew,
users noticed that they were now drowning in a sea of words, always
trying to reach for that elusive piece of information that would help
them stay afloat.
</p><p>
Zimbra's raison d'&ecirc;tre is to improve the e-mail experience by providing
a suite that simplifies as well as enhances the ease with which users
can sort through and retrieve information.
</p><p>
The Zimbra Collaboration Suite (Figure 1) is a powerful,
scalable application, suited for small to medium to very large
enterprises. Zimbra can be deployed in a high-availability, clustered
environment where it can serve up huge numbers of clients, and serve them
it does. For instance, Zimbra customer H&amp;R Block serves up 100,000
users, while the University of Toronto's numbers are in the tens of
thousands. Zimbra's customers are varied (for example, Mozilla and Digg.com), from
ISPs and content providers who offer Zimbra as a service to businesses,
universities, government offices and nonprofits.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f1.large.jpg"><img src="9619f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Zimbra Collaboration Suite, Ajax Client View
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fc768"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
When speaking with Zimbra, I asked about the
service model where customers sign up for Zimbra e-mail accounts,
and where those accounts are ad-supported or value-add is provided
through Zimbra extensions. Zimbra informed me that about 80% of Zimbra
installations are on premise deployments. The company doesn't believe
that e-mail is going to a hosted model as with CRM.
</p></div><p>
I've had a few weeks to play with the Zimbra Collaboration Suite, and
I am, overall, very impressed. That said, nothing is perfect&mdash;more
details as I go along.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fc9d0"></a>
What Does Zimbra Do?</h2></div></div><p>
The Zimbra Collaboration Suite belongs in a class of network
applications we've come to call groupware&mdash;an intelligent collection
of CRM, of which e-mail is the core, usually provided through
a Web interface. In addition to e-mail, the Zimbra messaging server
supports shared group calendars and contact management tools. Zimbra is
both a client-side solution and a powerful integrated messaging server
application that includes Postfix, LDAP, Apache and more. Zimbra includes
some clever extensions, such as zimlets (more on these later), and enterprise
mashups that allow users to interact naturally with information embedded in
their e-mail messages, so they easily can use that information in other
applications. These applications even can be third-party applications,
such as a purchasing system.
</p><p>
It's impossible to talk about a product like Zimbra without making
comparisons to Microsoft Exchange, so I answer the obvious questions
here. Zimbra is an impressive replacement for
Microsoft Exchange. Zimbra
offers migration tools that simplify the move from Exchange to Zimbra
(Lotus Notes migration tools also are available). Outlook clients are
fully supported, and that means it works with all Outlook e-mail, contacts
and calendar functions (MAPI sync, however, is available only with the
Zimbra Network Edition). If you happen to be fond of another mail client,
such as Thunderbird or Eudora, you can continue using it. That said, once
you start working with Zimbra's impressive browser-based Ajax client,
you may say goodbye forever to your old client software. Zimbra also
supports a number of mobile devices, such as the iconic BlackBerry.
</p><p>
As the above paragraph hints, Zimbra is available in different flavors,
including a community supported Open Source Edition and a commercially-supported Network Edition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fcbe0"></a>
Working with Zimbra</h2></div></div><p>
Zimbra is a Web application that doesn't feel like a Web
application. Several very cool features take Ajax design to a very
advanced destination. For instance, Zimbra provides natural keyboard
mapping.
</p><p>
Let me give you an example. With most Web mail applications, you would
delete a message (or a batch of messages) by selecting each message
with a click in a check box beside the message, finding the Delete
button and clicking there. Zimbra works the way you expect your desktop
application to work. Simply select a group of messages (click, Shift-click,
or Ctrl-click), and then press the Delete key.
</p><p>
Let me give you another example. In your run-of-the-mill Web mail
application, you move messages into a folder by selecting them via a
check box, clicking a &ldquo;move to&rdquo; button, clicking on the
destination folder
from a drop-down list, then clicking Move. Zimbra users select their
messages and drag them into the appropriate folder&mdash;exactly like you would
on your desktop. To switch folders, double-click on the folder. To read
a message, double-click on the message. The key mapping is so natural
that after a while, you forget you are working with a Web application.
</p><p>
This natural, or at least familiar, approach is consistent across
all Zimbra applications. In the calendar view, creating an appointment
is simply a matter of dragging your mouse across a time slot, and Zimbra
pops up an appointment dialog for you to fill in (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f2.large.jpg"><img src="9619f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Zimbra incorporates an easy-to-use and powerful shared calendar
application that is tightly integrated with the rest of the suite.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fd000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Zimbra's Ajax interface is supported on several
different browsers, including Firefox 1.0+, Netscape 7.1+,
Internet Explorer 6.0+, Mozilla 1.4+ and Safari 1.3+ (although that
is currently beta support). When I tried to use Zimbra with Opera and
Konqueror, I was stopped with an error message listing the supported
browsers. With browsers such as Konqueror, it's possible to change the
browser identification and masquerade as something else. After doing
that, Zimbra
allowed me to continue, but I still ran into problems. Apparently,
it means it when it says unsupported. For those unsupported browsers,
Zimbra offers its basic interface, with a link provided on the error
page.
</p></div><p>
When working with this sort of application, it's not unusual to check
your e-mail, then switch to calendar view to confirm your free time,
and then go back to your e-mail again. Zimbra can recognize strings inside your e-mail
messages, such as a phone number or a date. Figure 3 shows me looking at
an e-mail message in which the sender is asking whether I'm free for a
particular date. Zimbra recognizes that this is a date and informs me of my
availability for that time slot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f3.large.jpg"><img src="9619f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. No need to switch from your e-mail to your calendar. Zimbra
gives you the information you need, inline.
</p></div></div><p>
If the time slot is free, there's no need to switch to calendar
view here either&mdash;simply right-click on the date, select New
Appointment and
then enter the details. It's wonderfully simple and intuitive.
</p><p>
It gets better. Zimbra also is able to recognize other
contextual information (highlighted in blue), such as the word tomorrow, or
even multiple words, such as next Wednesday. The program then checks
your calendar for you when you hover over the word (or words). Zimbra also
understands addresses and phone numbers, highlighting them as well.
If
it sees a phone number, Zimbra offers to launch a telephony program
such as Skype or Ekiga. Hover over an e-mail address, and Zimbra
looks up that contact in your address book and floats a pop-up with that
person's contact information. No need to leave your e-mail and
switch to your address book to call your client.
</p><p>
The user experience is enriched further with built-in antispam and
antivirus tools, smart folders, RSS subscriptions and, of course, zimlets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fd580"></a>
Zimlets</h2></div></div><p>
When you hover over a time in an e-mail message and a pop-up alerts
you of your appointments for that time, you're seeing the work of
a zimlet. A zimlet can launch Skype when you hover over
a phone number. A few important zimlets are included in a default
Zimbra installation, but there are several of which you might not immediately
be aware, ranging from extremely useful to amusing
distractions. When you install (or deploy) these extra zimlets, they
appear in your sidebar, right above your mini-calendar.
</p><p>
Some of the extra zimlets are worth exploring. In addition to the
phone dialer (which uses Skype by default), there's also a zimlet
that takes advantage of an Asterisk VoIP system. Deploy the Yahoo! Maps
zimlet, and Zimbra recognizes addresses embedded in text and pops up a
street map when you hover over the address. This function didn't catch
all address strings I tested, but you can enter the address manually
by clicking on the zimlet. There's a Wikipedia zimlet and a Google
translator zimlet as well (Figure 4). Simply drag a message onto the
Google translator zimlet, select a language and click OK.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f4.large.jpg"><img src="9619f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. No cutting and pasting required for translations. Simply drag a
message onto the Google Translator zimlet.
</p></div></div><p>
As much as I hate to admit it, the zimlet I wasted far too much time
on is the arcade zimlet (call it a nostalgia trip). Several classic
arcade games are included to provide some much-needed diversion. After
all, all work and no play does not necessarily translate into increased
productivity. Spend a few minutes blasting
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Asteroids</em></span>, helping <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frogger</em></span>
cross the street, saving the Earth from the evil <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space
Invaders</em></span> or
de-stress with a little game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span> (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f5.large.jpg"><img src="9619f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. How about a little downtime with a classic game of
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Pac Man</em></span>?
</p></div></div><p>
There are also zimlets for traffic reports (letting your employees
know when it's a good time to go home or what areas to avoid), and zimlets for
Amazon.com sales, tracking flights, booking travel arrangements,
looking up the status of an order or package, sending short messages (SMS)
to a cell phone and more.
</p><p>
Zimlets can be installed manually (via the command line) or through the
graphical Zimbra administrative interface, which I would recommend. The
administrative interface is as well designed as the user interface but
provides access to different functions. These include reporting and
system statistics, user maintenance, global address lists, aliases,
as well as server, site and domain configuration. Settings related
to security are configured here as well. For instance, you may want to
block out attachments with certain extensions, such as .BAT, .EXE, .VBS
and so on (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9619f6.large.jpg"><img src="9619f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The administrative interface lets you reject messages whose
attachments have questionable extensions.
</p></div></div><p>
The administrative interface also provides download links to migration
tools for Exchange and Lotus Domino servers. There's also a download
there to help you import information from PST files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x1cf6170"></a>
Any Minuses?</h2></div></div><p>
Well, yes. Browser support could be a little better, but it covers the
majority of browsers and certainly the most popular. I personally
would like to see Konqueror supported and Opera as well. Some of the zimlets
didn't always do what they were supposed to do&mdash;for example, the Yahoo! Maps zimlet
sometimes highlighted addresses and sometimes didn't. Even there,
I could double-click on the zimlet, enter the address manually, and
it would come up.
</p><p>
The biggest negative, in my opinion, had to do with getting Zimbra up
and running in the first place. The command-line text-install process
feels a little last-century to me. Not that there's anything wrong with
the command line&mdash;you're looking at one of the great proponents of
the command line's power and flexibility. Nevertheless, having the
installation shell script terminate to tell me I need another package,
then having to restart it to discover I needed something else (then having
it terminate again), is far from ideal.
</p><p>
Then comes the configuration part of the text install where parts of
the dialog scroll off the screen. Sure, I can scroll back, but why not
make it fit on a screen? Heck, a Web interface that assisted you in
dealing with any prerequisite or configuration issues should be easy
for a company that can come up with such a slick client interface.
</p><p>
I blame most of my installation problems on that inflexible text-only script. Before finding myself with a finished product, I ran three
different installations. I tried the first install on my own production
system, assuming (falsely) that I could run Zimbra concurrently&mdash;a
bad move that took my own e-mail and Web services off-line for a few
hours. To be fair, I can't really blame Zimbra here, because I should not
have been doing that on a production system, but I often install
and test software on my production systems without any problems. A
simple warning that Zimbra's Postfix and Apache servers would occupy
the same network space as mine (and that I might want to reconsider)
would have stopped me in my tracks.
</p><p>
Eventually, I chose another clean system for my installation, and
it just plain refused to finish. The generic error message told me
nothing. Because it was a supported release, I tried again, re-installing
(as opposed to upgrading), and everything worked perfectly. Why? This was
the same system where it failed a few minutes before, so I don't have a
good explanation.
</p><p>
When I finally got Zimbra installed, it was such a great experience
I almost forgot about my installation headaches&mdash;almost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x1cf6430"></a>
Licensing and Costs</h2></div></div><p>
Zimbra is a free and open-source package, but it also offers commercial
packages and support. The Network Edition offers full commercial support
plus additional, value-added features. For instance, clustering,
including advanced backup and recovery features, and a powerful
attachment search function, aren't part of the Open Source Edition.
Neither are the Outlook MAPI and Apple iSync connectors; for these,
you need the Network Edition. Over-the-air mobile synchronization
(Simbian, Treo and Windows mobile phones with no additional software
required on the handset) is another such value-add. Blackberry support
is available through a third party. (Note to RIM&mdash;it would be really,
really great if there were a general-purpose API for BEZ synchronization.)
</p><p>
The Zimbra Collaboration Suite is available for a variety of
distributions and platforms. If packages for your particular distribution
aren't available, Zimbra provides source so you can compile your
own. Both Network and Open Source Editions are released at the same
time. Zimbra doesn't want the installation to be different,
regardless of whether it is the Network or Open Source Edition. Even so, only a
few major distributions (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server) are supported for the Network Edition. If you are
interested in the Network Edition, you may, for the time being, want to
stick with the Open Source Edition.
</p><p>
If yours is one of the supported Network Edition platforms, I recommend
that you download the Network Edition first. A free, 60-day trial is
included, which provides you with all the Network Edition features. If
you choose not to continue with the Network Edition after the 60-day
period expires, your Zimbra Collaboration Suite automatically returns
to the Open Source Edition, and you'll have lost nothing.
</p><p>
Prices for the Network Edition are reasonable, starting at $25 US per
user, per year. Special discounted rates are available for educational
institutions, governments and nonprofits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x1cf6640"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
Color me impressed! The Zimbra Collaboration Suite is a fantastic
product and well worth your consideration. Working with Zimbra's polished
Ajax client is a pleasure, and even the Open Source Edition is feature-rich. Some of the zimlets, though imperfect (such as the Yahoo! Maps
zimlet), still provide a great improvement to the standard groupware
experience.
</p><p>
Installation, on the other hand, could be a lot smoother, and I'd like
to see more distributions supported in the Network Edition, but these
installation-time issues don't affect the user experience.
</p><p>
If you don't need the features provided by the Network
Edition, the price for Zimbra is certainly right, offering a
great deal of functionality without the cost. If you want
to take advantage of the Zimbra features but don't want to do the
hosting on your own, Zimbra provides a list of hosting partners at
