Thanks for Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column in the December 2007 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I learned some new things from
it. Truth be told, most of the articles in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> are
irrelevant to me, but I
slow down and pay attention when I come to Dave's column.
</p><p>
Dave didn't mention it, but surely he knows about calc
(<a href="http://isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc" target="_self">isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc</a>)?
This is a very powerful command-line calculator that I use often.
</p><p>
In the interest of full disclosure, Landon Curt Noll happens to be a
personal friend who wrote calc long before I became acquainted with him.
Keep doing what you're doing in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.

Dell Linux Systems</h4><p>
I'm part of the reason Dell is showing weak sales on Linux systems.
I just purchased a slightly upgraded Dell Inspiron 530 for $579.75 with
Windows XP, and I'm reformatting and putting Linux on it the day it arrives.
</p><p>
I considered getting the identical FreeDOS or Ubuntu version, but they
were several hundred dollars more expensive, because they offer only a $150
rebate instead of the $360 rebate that you get with Windows!
</p><p>
Something stinks at Dell when a Linux or FreeDOS box costs $210 more
than an XP box.

Thank you for three game articles in the December 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. I am
glad to see progress in Linux gaming. Games are the only reason I still
have a Windows partition on my computer. The best first-person games are
still only on Windows (<span   class="emphasis"><em>BioShock</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Oblivion</em></span>
and so on). Fortunately, my favored
strategy game does have a Linux version: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dominions

I was recently browsing through the archived articles of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>, and I noticed that the past year or two has marked a
decline in the number of articles targeted at business Linux users. Recent
articles have focused more on home and educational users and developers
than on the business administrator.
</p><p>
I understand that it's a struggle to find a balance between which audiences
you target, but as the manager of an Information Technology department for
a medium-size business, I would appreciate more focus on the business
administration side of things. I'm looking for articles that give me good,
detailed suggestions on how and where Linux can be useful to my
organization. It's great to read an article about thin clients, LTSP and
how the two can be used together in a lab environment for students in a
school, but I don't have large lab environments with various people coming
and going all day using the same machines. I have cubicles where the same
people sit down at the same desks every day and use business applications,
like Microsoft Office and Visual Studio. How about some articles that tell
me how I can implement OpenOffice.org without making my users angry and
without making it impossible to interact with all of our customers and
suppliers who use Microsoft Office? How about articles that present
methods to migrate Microsoft Access Databases (I use the term
&ldquo;database&rdquo;
coupled with &ldquo;Microsoft Access&rdquo; very loosely) to open-source RDBMS systems
with Web interfaces? Articles focusing on ERP systems for businesses? Of
course, I'm not suggesting that you turn your attention entirely or even
primarily toward business users (unless, of course, you'd like to fork
another edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>), just that you bring some of
the focus back to that area. Also, I realize that Doc Searls has his
Linux for Suits column, but the times I've read that, it seems to read
more like the editorial page of a newspaper and less like a practical guide
for implementing Linux in a business environment.
</p><p>
Finally, because of some of the editorial comments I've read in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> about
the Novell/Microsoft agreement, I have to put in my two bits about the
deal. I understand the strong anti-Microsoft reaction of Linux purists
everywhere, I realize that it certainly isn't an ideal situation, and I
understand the wary attitudes with which people approach the deal and say,
&ldquo;What kind of stunt is Microsoft going to pull this time?&rdquo; That's all
completely understandable. However, as I said before, I manage an IT
department, and Novell is helping me save loads of money on Microsoft
licensing and is providing some very promising prospects for alternatives
to Microsoft software in the very near future, along with some prospects
for more interoperable systems between Microsoft's software and
non-Microsoft software. Of course, I, too, am a bit cautious about what
Microsoft sees in the deal, but I'm also a very satisfied Novell customer
and see a lot of potential for their products to, at the very least, become
a gateway out of the Microsoft world and into open source.

Determinism</h4><p>
I enjoyed Roman Shaposhnik's article &ldquo;Roman's Law and Fast Processing
with Multiple CPU Cores&rdquo; in the November 2007 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, but he too briefly touched on an issue with
large future implications. The problem isn't finding ways to make
threads more deterministic; the problem is in our assumption that
computers should be deterministic. A reliance on determinism works for
processing on 8, or 16, or even 256 cores, but what about 256,000
cores? Or 256 million cores? As elements flicker in and out due to
errors and faults, these creations will be better imagined as
statistical ensembles than simple machines, no matter how many
OSI-like layers are created. As a developer, you can become comfortable
with ways to flesh out the gotchas that occur in parallel
environments, but there is only so far that tools and insights can go
if they are based on the wrong foundation. At some point in the future,
we'll need to trade our Boolean yes or no for a Bayesian degree of
belief. The software community has started to get a taste of this in
loosely coupled aggregates like grids, but there is much, much more to
come.

Baffled</h4><p>
I have been a reader of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for many years and find something
to enjoy in every issue. I was, however, somewhat baffled by your
inclusion of Sandeep Sahore's Tech Tip on his program showdate in the
November 2007 issue.
</p><p>
Although it is indeed very useful to determine dates in the past and
future, showdate is entirely unnecessary, and by the author's own
admission, broken and quirky.
</p><p>
May I present GNU date, included with every distribution of Linux I have
ever used (source available for your favorite UNIX, naturally). For the
benefit of your readers, I have duplicated the examples from the
showdate Tech Tip and added a few more.
</p><p>
The date ten years ago:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="10 years ago"
</pre>
</p><p>
Same as above in epoch seconds:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="10 years ago" +%s
</pre>
</p><p>
Five years, two months and 23 days from now in the format YY-MM-DD:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="+5 years +2 months +23 days" +%y-%m-%d
</pre>
</p><p>
With date, when you combine + and - in one command, it does the right
thing (unlike showdate):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date +%y-%m-%d
07-12-05 (now)
$ date --date="-5 years +2 months +23 days" +%y-%m-%d
03-02-28 (2 months and 23 days after 5 years ago)
</pre>
</p><p>
Schedule an at job 12 minutes and 35 seconds from now:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ at -t $(date --date="+12 minutes +35 seconds" +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S)
</pre>
</p><p>
Date isn't broken by large numbers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="+1000 years"
Sat Dec  5 16:41:40 EST 3007
$ date --date="+10000 years"
Wed Dec  5 17:01:17 EST 12007
</pre>
</p><p>
Date understands weeks too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="+3 weeks"
</pre>
</p><p>
Date is even more flexible, for example, all of the following are valid:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date --date="yesterday"
$ date --date="tomorrow"
$ date --date="last thursday"
$ date --date="+2 weeks yesterday" (two weeks from yesterday)
</pre>
</p><p>
In fairness, like many GNU programs, a lot of the above is 
documented only on the info page (not the man page).

Another Tip on a Tip</h4><p>
This is in response to the Tech Tip on page 92 of the January 2008 issue,
&ldquo;Removing Duplicate Lines in Unsorted Text
without Losing Input Order&rdquo;.
If you have Perl installed (most distros do), you could do
it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ perl -ne'$x{$_}++||print' /tmp/numbers
</pre>

Bash Can Do It</h4><p>
I was surprised and dismayed to see Dave Taylor resort to Perl to map
letters to numeric values, in his January 2008 Work the Shell column. He states
that the shell can't do this easily: &ldquo;There's nothing I can imagine
without extraordinary levels of effort.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Perl is not needed; bash can do the same thing easily:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ordvalue=$((`printf "%d\n" "'$letter"`-96))
</pre>


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Russ Turner  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>

Get a Clue</h4><p>
Mick Bauer's column &ldquo;Getting a Clue with WebGoat&rdquo;, in the January
2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, was missing a few clues. After some trial and error using
Ubuntu 7.10, I found all the &ldquo;Gutsy&rdquo; clues. Mr Bauer left me clueless on
setting the JAVA_HOME variable. The QRG is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.13
$ wget http://webgoat.googlecode.com/files/
&#8618;Unix_WebGoat-5.0_Release.zip
$ unzip Unix_WebGoat*.zip
$ wget
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/owasp/
&#8618;webscarab-installer-20070504-1631.jar?modtime=1178324741
$ java -jar webscarab-installer-20070504-1631.jar
$ java -jar "/home/username/WebScarab/webscarab.jar"
$ sudo sh ./webgoat.sh start80
</pre>
</p><p>
What doesn't kill me makes me better. 
</p><p>
PS. I like (intentionally, I hope) that the use of Tomcat was installed
with WebGoat and that in the same issue Alan Berg had an article on efficiency
tricks with Apache and Tomcat titled &ldquo;Separate the Static from the
Dynamic with Tomcat and Apache&rdquo;. As my first use of Tomcat was with
WebGoat, touching on Tomcat later in the issue gave me a chance to
further explore Tomcat. Bravo.

Iceweasel Clarification</h4><p>
In the January 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, Kyle
Rankin wrote an article concerning
anonymous Web browsing. Although the bulk of his content appears
accurate, I noticed a fairly big mistake in one reference regarding the
Knoppix LiveCD. He refers to Iceweasel as &ldquo;Firefox's name on
Knoppix&rdquo;. This is inaccurate. Iceweasel is the forked browser based
on Firefox, built initially by the Debian distribution. Iceweasel
relieves the non-free issues that are part of the Firefox browser, as
the Firefox browser cannot be redistributed using the Mozilla Firefox
name or logo if any changes are made by a distribution.

GRUB Security</h4><p>
I enjoyed the &ldquo;The Tao of Linux Security&rdquo; article by Jeramiah
Bowling in the January 2008 issue
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. I do have one small tip for the
author, however.
He suggests setting a password to the GRUB bootloader by
adding <tt  >password yourpasswordhere</tt> below the timeout line in the GRUB
config file. Although this is technically accurate, if we're shooting
for security, let's try not to leave passwords lying around in plain
text.
</p><p>
Most major distributions should ship with the
<tt  >grub-md5-crypt</tt> command
that allows you to generate md5-hashed passphrases for the GRUB
bootloader. I suggest that anyone applying a GRUB security
model would use this tool to generate an md5-hashed password and use
that via the syntax <tt  >password --md5
pasteyourmd5hashhere</tt>.

</p><a name="N0x152c580.0x161deb8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x152c580.0x161deb8"></a>More Work the Shell Tips</h4><p>
In the January 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, Dave
Taylor is musing over &ldquo;how do you step through a word, letter by
letter, in a shell script&rdquo;,
and later, &ldquo;how do you convert characters into corresponding numerical
codes&rdquo;. Here is how (bash):

<pre     class="programlisting">
in=linux
while [ -n "$in" ]; do
   val=$(($(printf %d '"'${in:0:1}) - 96))
   echo "... letter ${in:0:1} has value $val"
   in=${in:1}
done
</pre>
</p><p>
As for the Perl code used later in the same article, the simplest way
to get from a string a list of corresponding byte codes is to use
unpack with a C* or c* pattern. So the following Perl gives
the result he is after:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@values = map {$_ - 96} unpack "C*", "linux";
</pre>
</p><p>
A corresponding list of &ldquo;letter keys&rdquo; will be produced by
<tt  >split //, "linux";</tt>. Of course, variables could be used in place
of literal strings.
