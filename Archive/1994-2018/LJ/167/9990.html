Computer Professionals' Union Karapatan-Monitor</h2></div></div><p>
Here's some irony for you. On one hand, Google stifles human rights
by censoring Google China for the authoritarian Chinese regime.
At the same time, Google Code hosts an antidote, a new human-rights
monitoring program, called Karapatan-Monitor. Created and maintained by
the Computer Professionals' Union in the Philippines, the open-source
Karapatan-Monitor records incidents of human-rights violations and
allows for classification of violations, perpetrators and victim status.
Specific victim updates (for example, court cases and file attachments)
also can
be recorded. Now, the question remains, &ldquo;Dear Google, can those who
need Karapatan-Monitor most, such as our Chinese brothers and sisters,
even access it?&rdquo;

Avinti's NEWT Free Malware Security Service</h2></div></div><p>
The battle of good vs. evil continues, with the good guys adding a sharp
new arrow to the quiver: Avinti's NEWT Free Malware Security Service.
Fresh out of beta, NEWT (Neutralize E-mail and Web Threats) is
a freeware plugin filter for Sendmail, Postfix and (soon) Exim that
addresses blended threat attacks. Avinti reported an average of 750
new threat e-mail messages per day in late 2007. The company emphasizes that
&ldquo;blended threats are an increasingly popular way for hackers to bypass
traditional e-mail security&rdquo; by sending URLs hosted on botnet-infected
computers. In addition, &ldquo;some of the malware also is on legitimate
sites that have been injected with a cross-site scripting hack, making
detection and blocking by Web filters difficult.&rdquo; NEWT can block, tag
or quarantine e-mail messages containing such threats. NEWT is available for
free download from Avinti's Web site.

WaveMaker's Visual Assembly Studio &amp; Rapid Deployment Framework</h2></div></div><p>
WaveMaker has declared Visual Assembly Studio &amp; Rapid Deployment
Framework, a new team of products for developing Web applications, as
&ldquo;Web Fast and CIO Safe&rdquo;. (Do you breathe fire, as well, dear CIO?)
Visual Assembly Studio provides departmental developers with a visual
environment to create scalable, data-driven Web applications without
complex code or portal frameworks. Meanwhile, Visual Assembly Studio
enables the drag-and-drop assembly of Web applications using Ajax widgets,
Web services and databases. WaveMaker claims a 67% decrease in development
time and a 98% reduction in lines of code written vis-&agrave;-vis .NET. Both
products are built on open source and open standards. Visual Assembly
Studio is free, and the Rapid Deployment Framework is available under
commercial license.

VMware's ESX Server in SAP Production Environments</h2></div></div><p>
VMware, Inc., and SAP AG recently announced a partnership whereby SAP's
64-bit enterprise applications and business solutions (such as ERP, BI,
CRM, SCM and so on) for Linux and Windows will run on VMware's ESX Server.
Already-certified hardware includes servers from Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP,
IBM and Sun. Both firms will collaborate on support services and problem
resolution arising from the partnership. The companies state that the
partnership will &ldquo;combine the powerful process management capabilities
of SAP solutions with the robust data-center management and cost-saving
features of VMware infrastructure.&rdquo; The results are projected to provide
improved management of IT resources, reduced downtime, reduced server
sprawl and quick-and-easy server provisioning.

Edward L. Haletky's <span   class="emphasis"><em>VMware ESX Server in the Enterprise: Planning and
Securing Virtualization Servers</em></span> (Prentice-Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
If you take advantage of the SAP-VMware deal (page 40), here's a
strategically placed impulse buy: Edward L. Haletky's <span   class="emphasis"><em>VMware ESX Server in
the Enterprise: Planning and Securing Virtualization Servers</em></span>, published
by Prentice-Hall. Author Haletky, an expert in large-scale ESX Server
implementations, has gathered a practical, solutions-focused collection
of information on the application&mdash;tips, best practices, field-tested
solutions, issues, trade-offs and pitfalls. He also covers the entire
life cycle, including planning, installation, system monitoring, tuning,
clustering, security, disaster recovery and so on. Focusing on ESX v3.x,
the book also illustrates differences with ESX v2.5.

Online</em></span>

Nowadays, finding a professionally produced guide to an open-source
application is a snap, thanks in part to nimble book publishers like Packt
Publishing. Packt just released Vadym Gurevych's <span   class="emphasis"><em>osCommerce Webmaster's
Guide to Selling Online</em></span>, a guide to creating a successful osCommerce-based
on-line business. osCommerce is an open-source e-commerce solution using

Packt offers a different book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deep Inside osCommerce: The
Cookbook</em></span>,
for the development side of the application.

Sander van Vugt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Ubuntu Server Administration: From Novice to

as it has the desktop? Apress has a new means for you to decide for
yourself in Sander van Vugt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Ubuntu Server Administration:
From Novice to Professional</em></span>. Intended for system administrators who
need to &ldquo;land that crucial entry-level job&rdquo;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Ubuntu</em></span> will help
you securely install, update and deploy an Ubuntu server, focusing
on practical information rather than theory. The book covers standard

OpenPeak's OpenFrame Devices</h2></div></div><p>
In-home device convergence has long been the Holy Grail for many
a company. Remember WebTV? (Stop giggling, please, we must proceed!)
A new and compelling Grail-seeker is OpenPeak with its forthcoming
OpenFrame line of devices. Although details remain sketchy pre-Consumer
Electronics Show, we do know that the goal is to create a line
of Linux-based devices that &ldquo;revolutionize the home phone into a
'third screen', complementing the home's PC, TVs and mobile phones.&rdquo;
These devices will utilize telephony, VoIP and Internet, thus allowing
users to access e-mail, voice mail, personal calendars and information,
as well as leave memos for family members and make phone calls&mdash;all
from one device. The good news for us is that OpenPeak is seeking outside
developers to create applications for its software platform. All products
will be available through OEM partners, the first of which is Verizon.
