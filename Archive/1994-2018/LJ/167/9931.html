Video editing in Linux can be hell, but a handful of programs
are showing the way forward to a better world.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2b3c3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the January 2006 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I wrote an extensive article surveying
the state of the art in video production software on Linux. At the time,
there were a lot of new players, some brought into the field from the
first Google Summer of Code, and very few of them were serviceable all the
way around. 
</p><p>
The intervening years have done their Darwinian work, with some
projects maturing rapidly, others stagnating and others being abandoned or
disappearing off the Net altogether. But, as Nietzsche noted (or would
have if he were as interested in software as he was in philosophy), &ldquo;What
doesn't kill a project, makes it stronger.&rdquo; This article is about the
survivors. Few though they are, some have managed to thrive.
</p><p>
Video editing on Linux always has been curiously
bifurcated. On
the one hand, there are glorious high-end finishing packages, such as
Discreet Smoke, that are used routinely on big-budget productions, but the
price tag for a single Smoke system runs into the tens of thousands of
dollars, so it's not particularly budget-friendly. On the other hand,
there are excellent low-end packages, such as Kino, which handles DV with
grace, speed and polish. The middle ground between them is littered with
half-finished projects, failed projects and Cinelerra, a behemoth that is
both finished and polished but can be said to &ldquo;work&rdquo; only in the sense that
a horse with five legs might learn how to walk.
</p><p>
That is changing.
</p><p>
There is nothing, in theory, stopping an open-source video editor
from offering the basic functionality of a Premier or a Final Cut Pro,
together with the switching ability of a product like Casablanca to produce
very quick edits of multicamera shoots. Cuisine, in fact, was developed
with this ability in mind, and even though it got only halfway there before
it was abandoned, several of the innovations it used toward that end could
be instructive. Some of the projects here already are well on that road.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2b3c870"></a>
The Main Contenders</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux multitrack field is now dominated by three programs that
have been going gangbusters on development. All of them are not only
still standing but also are proceeding at a meteoric pace&mdash;and in a promising
direction: Jason Wood's KDENLIVE, Richard Spindler's OpenMovieEditor and
The Blender Foundation's Blender.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2b3c978"></a>
KDENLIVE</h2></div></div><p>
KDENLIVE (the KDE Non-LInear Video Editor) is the project that has
garnered the bulk of my ink thus far (I reviewed it in-depth in the
September 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>), mostly because it has been a clear leader for quite
a long time. It was the first multitrack in the current crop to attain
usability.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9931f1.large.jpg"><img src="9931f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KDENLIVE's default interface resembles early versions of
Premier or MainActor.
</p></div></div><p>
Pioneered by Jason Wood and now maintained by a team of developers,
KDENLIVE is a Qt-based editor that uses FFmpeg as its decoding engine and
Dan Dennedy's MLT as its frameserver and EDL backbone. It's a powerful
combination, putting it into a position to handle HD as easily as
garden-variety DV, and opening up its importable profile to include pretty
much any video format you can watch on a Linux box.
</p><p>
The interface is laid out much like that of the late MainActor.
It's familiar and easy to pick up, and if you're like me and really hate
this paradigm, you can undock the interface components and reconfigure them
until your picky little heart is content.
</p><p>
The underlying MLT framework supports infinite audio and video
tracks, and there are a healthy number of built-in video and audio effects
(although extensive keyframing remains problematic at the time of this
writing). Its interface sluggishness mentioned in my prior review largely has
been solved, as have the difficulties working with interlaced
footage when scaling. The titler subsystem now works and is very nicely
compatible with installed TrueType fonts and a wide variety of raster
graphics formats.
</p><p>
All of this is great, but it doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this
crazy world if it can't perform. That's where the drawbacks show up. It's
still fairly crash-prone, and the current migration from FFmpeg as the
frameserver to MLT has broken a few things relating to a/v synchronization
with NTSC footage. These are known issues due to MLT bugs, which are, at
the time of this writing, being fixed (and hopefully will be fixed by the
time you read this).
</p><p>
There is still a way to go in a couple of areas. Its audio
toolkit is rudimentary, but its easy exporting dialogue-splitting means you
can split the audio and push it over to Audacity or Ardour for sweetening
once your edit is done.
</p><p>
The export GUI also presents a problem. As extensive as it is,
it isn't friendly for creating new profiles, which means that you have to
hand-tweak scripts or wait for new profiles if you want one that doesn't
happen to come prepackaged. Fortunately, the plethora of profiles is quite
staggering, including a wide range conforming to all the current HD
broadcast standards.
</p><p>
The final weakness&mdash;and the most annoying to me personally&mdash;is
KDENLIVE's lack of support for importing image sequences. It's something
that should be axiomatic in a system using FFmpeg as a back end, as
FFmpeg is an excellent manipulator of image sequences and Bash has
wild cards for such things built in. This alone bumps KDENLIVE out of the
professional space, but with this exception, it is a highly promising work
in progress, stable enough to use so long as you don't mind pressing Ctrl-S
fairly frequently. Its most irritating issues are pretty much solved, and
I've used it to complete several short and long-form projects.
It's perfectly serviceable for day-to-day use if you know your way around
your footage.
</p><p>
KDENLIVE is the only product in this roundup that supports video
capture.
</p><p>
Here's hoping the development team keeps up the excellent work!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2b3d058"></a>
OpenMovieEditor</h2></div></div><p>
OpenMovieEditor is the brainchild and personal hobby of Richard
Spindler, and it's generally stable, fast and usable. It supports the full
range of framerates and allows for the creation of pretty much any working
profile, and it sits partly&mdash;though by no means exclusively&mdash;on FFmpeg
with all the glorious format compatibility that this implies.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9931f2.large.jpg"><img src="9931f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. OpenMovieEditor's FLTK interface: the editing
tools are all embedded right in the interface next to the tracks, and the
nodes editor for the compositing subsystem is visible at bottom left.
</p></div></div><p>
The work flow is pretty much what you'd expect, with the interface
closely mirroring what we've come to expect from KDENLIVE and similar
projects. Unlike KDENLIVE, the interface is not easily reconfigurable.
However, because it's built on FLTK, it's fairly rock-solid. It doesn't
crash, it's fast and light and doesn't bog down due to fancy widget
rendering. The resulting look is fairly inhospitable cosmetically, but you
don't need rounded corners and crystalline widgets when you have a program
that stays up like a truck and speeds along like a Trans Am. 
</p><p>
HD compatibility is no problem; OpenMovieEditor
is profile-agnostic. If FFmpeg or libquicktime can read it, you can use it, and it's
always obvious what's compatible because it shows up with a thumbnail in
the media browser tab.
</p><p>
The development philosophy under which Spindler has proceeded 
leverages the power of the Open Source world to his project's advantage.
When I interviewed him for background for this article, he told me that,
behind the scenes, he is involved in several external video projects that
he uses to advance OpenMovieEditor, building on a suite of highly stable
external libraries: gavl, libquicktime, the Frei0r plugin API, JACK and
several others. All of these things extend the package considerably, with
Frei0r being of special note as the primary source for the video effects.
Spindler himself is involved in Frei0r, libquicktime and Cinelerra
development in varying degrees, which gives him the familiarity he uses to
integrate their best tricks into his own project. 
</p><p>
He has used it to stunning effect. The audio and video effects in
OpenMovieEditor work splendidly, although many of them could use more
settings controls to move them into a more professional realm. The latest
addition to his bag of tricks though is a major step in the right
direction and something hereto unheard-of in the realm of open-source
video editing packages: nodes-based compositing, which can use all the
installed video effects (although Blender also has a nodes-based
compositor, its interface with the video editor is oblique and patterned
more after the fashion of a finishing system than a video editor).
</p><p>
OpenMovieEditor is unique among Linux multitrack editors in that it
is capable of running its audio through the JACK Audio Connection Kit
(JACK). This gives it access to <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the excellent, readily available Linux
pro-audio tools, and with proper kernel patching it works in real time. The
upshot is that you can use OpenMovieEditor as part of a sync chain that
will allow you to create, compose and tweak your soundtrack while always
seeing the video and hearing the audio as it's mixed. It's hard to
overstate the power of this; it is unambiguously a professional feature,
and it's a great benefit to independent filmmakers and small studios who
need the performance it offers and aren't able to buy the higher-end
turnkey systems on offer for the film industry. But Spindler isn't
done&mdash;he and his community members are working on integrating the system with
Inkscape and with Blender for generating new transitions and other
effects.
The future on this seems bright!
</p><p>
When it comes to asset management, the program seems, at first
glance, not much different from KDENLIVE. Looks are deceiving
though&mdash;it's much
more flexible. When it comes to open-source projects, OpenMovieEditor's
asset management system, which allows clips to be stored in a bin off the
timeline for grabbing and inserting, is a work-flow tweak that makes shot
selection independent of the status of the edit, and also makes assembling the
selected shots far quicker. With its ability to set clips in the use bin
rather than whole files, its ability to use image sequences and its thumbnail
filesystem browsing, it is far above par, and much more sensible than what's
available for asset management in KDENLIVE or Blender.
</p><p>
One caveat that Spindler gave me when I interviewed him via e-mail:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
OpenMovieEditor is very much a work in progress; this
means that it is not yet feature-complete, but that it has a rapid
pace of changes; development is happening rather fast, and not in a
very &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; fashion. So, it might happen that stuff that worked
once can break, or that new features are not as well tested as they
should be.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So, it's a wise procedure, when upgrading OpenMovieEditor, to test
fresh compiles thoroughly before installing them, or at least to keep
around an
older package you know to be working to revert to should there be
problems.
</p><p>
In sum, OpenMovieEditor is an excellent package all around and
well worth the time investment in learning it. It lacks the plethora of
export profiles offered by KDENLIVE, but it makes up for this with a
well-appointed, intuitive GUI that allows experienced editors to specify
their
own export settings for pretty much any destination or mastering format
supported anywhere under Linux. It goes further, supporting high bit-depth
editing, effects and export with integrated (though still primitive)
nodes-based compositing. This is a project with nowhere to go but up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2b3d840"></a>
Blender</h2></div></div><p>
Blender is justly and primarily famous for its standing as the
premier free/open-source 3-D graphics package, but that's not all it can do.
Because it is intended as an end-to-end finishing system for animation, it
has integrated a full-featured, OpenGL-driven video editor called the VSE
(Video Sequence Editor).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9931f3.large.jpg"><img src="9931f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Blender comes preconfigured with a video editing screen
setup. Video files are in cyan, sound in blue, and image sequences are in
purple, so you can tell at a glance what you're working with.
</p></div></div><p>
The VSE is, to say the least, pretty strange. Like all things in
Blender, the interface is built for efficiency and speed of use over
user-friendliness, so the learning curve is a bit steep, although knowing a
good bit about how the rest of Blender works will help out handsomely.
</p><p>
Blender's major shortcomings to this point, as a video editor, have
been threefold:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
As it started life as an animation editor, it hasn't had support
for fractional framerates such as are found in NTSC (29.97), which causes
sound sync problems when editing NTSC footage with sound. This is now
fixed in CVS, and with any luck, it will be in the next main release before
this article goes to press.
</p></li><li><p>
Its export paradigm is obtuse and hard to cope with, setting an
entry bar too high for most editors to be willing to consider. A bit of
practice makes this a non-issue.
</p></li><li><p>
It also has no asset management system&mdash;all that work has to be
done outside the program by editors carefully structuring their
directories and assets if they care to keep track of everything. This 
probably never will be addressed&mdash;thus far, there isn't a significant cry from
within the user community to change it, and I suspect it would take some
nontrivial code refactoring to pull it off. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, despite these initial weirdnesses, Blender's VSE has a lot
to recommend it, not the least of which is its easy integration with the
other parts of Blender. It can accept as inputs both rendered and
unrendered strips from the animation subsystem and the compositing
subsystem&mdash;a very powerful bonus. The compositing system itself (reviewed
in the November 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>) is a full-fledged professional
nodes-based system that goes far beyond the video effects available in any
other Linux editor. Additionally, Blender's VSE is itself a layers-based
compositor, with quite a few native and community-generated plugins for
color correction, greenscreen compositing, PIP work and so on.
</p><p>
In practice, this means that, when properly used, Blender's VSE
has, by one path or another, all the power of After Effects (sans
easily usable rotosplines), particularly for plane-based animation, a trick
I use regularly to design animated DVD menus. It also has a
professional color-correction tool that is totally absent from the other
editors in this article, a vectorscope.
</p><p>
For format compatibility, Blender shares the FFmpeg backbone with
KDENLIVE and OpenMovieEditor (initially integrated into Blender by Ian
Gowen as a Google SoC project), and it deals excellently with image
sequences (which is only natural, as it was originally an animation editor). Its
audio compatibility also is FFmpeg-based, and although Blender's audio
tools are paltry to the point of vanishing, it is quite suitable for video
editing where a separately mixed soundtrack is conformed to the video in
the VSE.
</p><p>
Like OpenMovieEditor and unlike KDENLIVE, Blender's VSE is
format-agnostic&mdash;the final output profile being controlled by the output
settings in the RenderButtons window.
</p><p>
Alas, Blender VSE has one more shortcoming: unlike
KDENLIVE or OpenMovieEditor, it has no option for direct stream copy to
prevent generation loss when rendering out to the same format you are using
for your source footage. If you're using Blender as a finishing system,
this isn't an issue; most of your footage will have effects applied and
thus be recompressed on export anyway. 
</p><p>
I personally don't use Blender as my primary video editor, though I
have found myself using it more and more as a finishing system and may
give it a go doing a full project on it sometime in the not-too-distant
future. It's an odd mix of best-of-bunch and worst-of-bunch, which might
not seem like a glowing recommendation, but it is an indispensable tool for
a Linux production pipeline.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2f36328"></a>
Detritus</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, there are a number of projects I haven't mentioned here.
Without exception, they are all unusable. They either haven't achieved
usability yet (Pitivi and Jahshaka), they are poorly designed, unstable and
resource-hungry (Cinelerra), or they are dead on the vine (MainActor and
Diva).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a44580.0x2f36430"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
One of the great weaknesses in open-source software in the video domain
thus far has been a lack of imagination. In the commercial world, because
of the way the industry has developed, there long have been a handful of
sharply divided paradigms for editing. Market strategy being what it is,
it's in the interest of commercial developers to keep their products for
the various paradigms in separate tracks: more programs equals more
redundant software sales, and the ability to set high prices for some
markets while giving away the software for other markets (usually bundled
with hardware). So far, open-source developers have been content to
emulate it, and it's a philosophy that has hobbled the development of a
killer app for video editing on Linux. All three of the projects
covered here would do well to take a look at the asset management, footage commenting
and multicamera switching strategies innovated by Drew Pertulla and
implemented in his now-fallow multitrack editor Cuisine and at other
innovations among the also-rans.
</p><p>
Fortunately, OpenMovieEditor and Blender are starting to break the
mold, and I have high hopes that KDENLIVE will follow suit.
</p><p>
However, what's left is quite usable and in some cases bordering on
downright impressive. So, grab your cameras, get a script, and dive on in!
