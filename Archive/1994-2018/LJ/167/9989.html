In June 1996, <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Week</em></span> ran a piece titled
&ldquo;Andreessen Eyes Internet OS&rdquo;.
Marc Andreessen was famously the prime author of the Mosaic and Netscape
browsers, and a cofounder of Netscape as well. The money quote from that
piece was, &ldquo;The only difference technically between Netscape's Navigator
browser and a traditional operating system is that Navigator will not
include device drivers.&rdquo;

</p><p>
Needless to say, this and other remarks along the same lines did not please
Microsoft. A great deal of history followed, including the &ldquo;browser
wars&rdquo;,
the sale of Netscape to AOL, the federal lawsuit against Microsoft, the
dot-com crash, Y2K and much more. Forgotten in the shuffle was Marc's
original ambition, which was to establish the browser as a platform, and in
the process, to commoditize operating systems to the &ldquo;bags of device
drivers&rdquo; they had long been called.
</p><p>
Now it's 2008, and Google is busy treating the browser as a platform and is
generally agnostic toward operating systems. (Its own services are mostly
deployed on Linux-based systems, but its applications are either
browser-based or made to run on multiple platforms. Google Earth is
the ideal example. Picasa is not.)
</p><p>
But, the browser is mostly where Google likes to run user-side apps as Web
services. In fact, Google now provides most or all of your basic desktop
application suite&mdash;mail, office (documents, spreadsheets, presentations),
calendar and instant messaging&mdash;inside your browser. It's up to the user
which bag of device drivers runs between browser and iron. May the best bag
win.
</p><p>
Thus, it was perhaps inevitable that somebody would come along and make a
bare-bones&mdash;or bare-browser&mdash;box that's optimized to run Google's
browser-based apps on the best-commoditized platform, fulfilling the
Andreessen Prophesy.
</p><p>
That somebody is Dave Liu, the 21-year-old CEO of Good OS LLC. The
company's main product is gOS, an Ubuntu-based distro tweaked to run Web
apps as if they were desktop ones. gOS might have been Yet Another Linux
Distro had it not made news last November when the $199 Everex gPC, running
gOS, sold out in two days at WalMart.com.
</p><p>
Though the price is low-end, the gPC doesn't hurt for features. Here are
the hardware specs, according to Everex: &ldquo;1.5GHz, VIA C7-D Processor,
512MB DDRII 533MHz, SDRAM, 80GB HD Drive, DVD-ROM/CD-RW Optical Drive, VIA
UniChrome Pro IGP Graphics, Realtek 6-Channel Audio, (1) 10/100 Ethernet
Port, (1) DB 15-Pin VGA Port, (6) USB 2.0 Ports, (1) RJ-11 Port, (1)
Headphone/Line-Out Port, (2) Microphone/Line-In Ports, (1) Serial Port, (1)
Parallel Port, (1) Keyboard, (1) Mouse, (1) Set of Amplified Stereo
Speakers&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Could this be the long-awaited starting point for
Linux in the mass market?
We thought it would be fun to catch up with Dave Liu in the midst of the
buzz that followed the news. Here's the dialogue that followed.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> So, what possessed you to create yet another Linux distribution?
</p><p>
DL: I'm actually fairly new to open source. Most of my work and studies at
UCLA had been centered on Web 2.0. I saw a lot of great Web 2.0
applications that weren't taken seriously. You had to be the type of person
to read TechCrunch, Mashable or other Web 2.0 blogs just to know they
existed. Like open source, I felt we were developing Web 2.0 just for each
other and not for the mainstream.
</p><p>
When I met the Enlightenment and open-source folks, I realized how we
needed to work together. Together, I envisioned taking Linux and Web 2.0
mainstream. With Google backing both of these communities, I felt the best
thing to do was to create a Linux distribution that made it easy for people
to access Google and other Web 2.0 applications. This was how our
communities could converge and help each other affect the mainstream.
</p><p>
We hope we will bring existing communities together, rather than simply
start a new one. In fact, shortly after I met Enlightenment, we recruited
some of its core developers to form our entire developer team.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> Tell us more about Enlightenment. What does it do?
</p><p>
DL: Enlightenment is an X Window System window manager. Like Compiz Fusion
and other window managers, it's a graphical layer that sits on top of the
Linux kernel. In the case of gOS, Enlightenment sits on top of a modified
Ubuntu. Enlightenment was the ideal choice for gOS for a lot of reasons.
Different from other window managers, Enlightenment enables gOS to run
even better on the lowest-end hardware configurations. On the lowest-end
hardware, the difference begins to show. That's where we see our advantage
in today's market of expensive, high-end operating systems...Vista,
Leopard. Enlightenment enables us to think about simplicity and affordability
in a PC.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> How about licensing? What are the licenses involved for gOS, for
Enlightenment?
</p><p>
DL: gOS is free for personal use and noncommercial distribution.
Specifically, we're under the Creative Commons
Attribution-Noncommercial-Share-Alike 3.0 Unported license. The majority of
software we've aggregated in gOS is under the GPL license&mdash;such as
Enlightenment, Ubuntu, OpenOffice.org and other open-source software.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Is Compiz in your plans for gOS? If so, how?
</p><p>
DL: At the moment, we have no plans to use Compiz Fusion. We'd like to
establish our difference with Enlightenment. With the next revision, we'd
like to ask the community for even more support in helping us develop EFL
(Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) applications that run in the
Enlightenment environment. As of now, we're using a hybrid of EFL and
non-EFL apps because our customers need a stable and full set of
applications. For example, since we're launching gOS notebooks in Q1, we
decided we had to tentatively replace our EFL-based Wi-Fi manager Exalt
with Network Manager, because we were still seeing some problems with
Exalt. In the future revisions, we hope to shift to all EFL-based apps so as to
complement and make full use of Enlightenment.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Tell us about Faqly, and how you're going to interact with customers
and users, as well as the dev communities.
</p><p>
DL: Faqly is people-powered tech support. It's a Web application that helps
end users and developers help one another. It's been interesting to see our
end users and developers interact and exchange tech support for user
feedback.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> We've read that you're offering a
full year of 24/7 support. Is that true?
What is the support policy overall, and how does it differ from competing
offerings?
</p><p>
DL: It's true! Well, it's true for customers who purchase the Everex gPC.
Wal-Mart requires PC companies to include toll-free tech support. Working
with Everex and Wal-Mart enabled us to offer a full year of 24/7 toll-free
support. That Everex supports open source with a toll-free support number
is quite different from most other OEMs and their Linux products. Dell, for
example, provides no support on its Ubuntu notebook. Initially, someone
will pay the bill for getting open source to the mainstream users; we're
glad that a smaller PC company like Everex is willing to lead the way.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Is this something for the low end, for the geeks or for geeks' moms?
</p><p>
DL: It's all those things&mdash;an ideal alternative, especially for a simple
PC, something that works out of the box with the help of &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo; or
Internet. We've also had a lot of people tell us they're excited about it,
because they want to buy it for their moms or their dads, who don't need
too much power and just want something simple, affordable and familiar.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> But, it's still a Linux box, so the geek who's giving the gift can still
ssh into it and help out if need be, right?
</p><p>
DL: It's definitely hackable. It's also good for someone who knows how to
do customizing in general, or to work as-is. And yes, you can wipe it clean
and install Windows if you like, but why would anyone want to do that? The
gPC, in terms of components, assembly and the software combination alone is
quite a deal.
</p><p>
The more important thing is where this is headed. I think we will soon see
more companies invest their future in Web applications or &ldquo;cloud
computing&rdquo;. What we're trying to do is jump the curve and help make a way
for others to do the same.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> Where do you fit in the midst of these other distros?
</p><p>
DL: I'd see our role as something like Kubuntu's has been. Derivative, but
taking some new directions to be more consumer-friendly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> What direction, for example?
</p><p>
DL: There really is a growing subset of people in the Open Source community
who care about consumers&mdash;people who want to make the Linux experience
palatable for average Joes. That's a big shift. And, that's whom we're
appealing to. We felt that Linux as a native OS project is a great
platform, but it still hasn't gone that final step to really connect it to
consumers and to differentiate it from everyone else in the consumer space.
To do that, you really have to bring a consumer aspect, and we saw that in
Web 2.0&mdash;in Google apps and YouTube.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> When you talk about Web 2.0 apps, you mean ones that work in a browser
as a kind of Web service?
</p><p>
DL: Pretty much. We're basically talking about software that runs in a
browser and is based on Linux. It's a paradigm shift away from the way you
would typically use software. Instead of compiling and selling it, and
having it run in the system, you're running everything in the browser. And,
there's a lot of Web 2.0 software out there that hasn't gotten into the
eyes of the public.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Examples?
</p><p>
DL: Even with the Google Docs&mdash;spreadsheet, calendar&mdash;we were surprised
at how people either had never heard of these things or had never tried
them. We were among the first to put all the Google applications into one
coherent package. So people could realize, going from one icon to another,
that Google and Web 2.0 really are their computer. Not only that, but by
computing in the cloud, users really are able to take their computer with
them without taking their computer. As long as they can log on at a caf&eacute; or
a friend's house, they have a computer of their own.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> You don't generally think of desktops as being things that live in a
browser. Are you abstracting the apps and their icons out of the browser
and putting them on the desktop?
</p><p>
DL: Yes. That's the idea. Users are accustomed to seeing applications in a
dock or in a start menu. We want to stick with the easiest and most-familiar models for desktop computing, even if the programs are executed
elsewhere. So yes, we're using a lot of Firefox shortcuts. From a tech
view, it's a lot of browser shortcuts on a dock. All the main ones are in a
dock, and a few more are in the start menu.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> How about for documents you want to keep on your own machine to work on
when you're off-line? Calendars, for example.
</p><p>
DL: We're still waiting for Gmail and Google Calendar to work off-line with
Google Gears. In the meantime, we packaged off-line applications, such as
OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> So you can do POP mail if you like.
</p><p>
DL: Exactly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Or presentations that people might
create on-line and then save to
give off-line on their machine or transport by thumbdrive to another
machine.
</p><p>
DL: Yes. Google has done a good job of balancing its products with open
source. It just packaged OpenOffice.org into the Google Pack. With Google
Gears, I think it's just a matter of time before we see every major Web
application be capable of syncing and working off-line.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> Are you in touch with the Google people on this?
</p><p>
DL: Yes. To be clear, the gOS is not the Google Operating System, although it
is my idea of what one should be like. Even before we closed a hardware
deal, I had used an obscure form on Google's Web site to apply for
permission to use trademarks. I said, &ldquo;Hey, we're an open-source OS
project, and we want to make it easier for people to use Google apps, mind letting
us use your icons and trademarks&rdquo;? Two or three weeks later, we got a letter
back, saying, &ldquo;Yeah, go ahead, as long as you have a
disclaimer saying this is not a Google product...&rdquo; So we did it. We just
didn't know we were going to get so much attention for it. When we started
working with Everex, we found that it had its own standard toolbar deal
with Google. Then Everex also showed Google a preview of our screenshots. In
that sense, there was &ldquo;approval&rdquo; from Google, but no official endorsement.
We have friends at Google and keep in touch with them on both the gPC and
the gOS.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> The g in gOS stands for...?
</p><p>
DL: The g stands for good. Our mission is to make a good OS. Good for
everyone. For example, we knew Microsoft to be a big, mean Goliath to
work with for OEMs. We wanted to make an OS that could be a good friend to
both consumers and OEMs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> What is your dev community like? Have you grown your own, in addition
to the Enlightenment folks?
</p><p>
DL: Our core dev team is about seven people. We've added one or two in the last
month. Once we got in the news, people starting hearing about us, and we
have developers coming in from different communities. Some Ubuntu
developers are helping out too. So we have a nice, little community going
and growing. It's still early and what we call &ldquo;controlled
chaos&rdquo;. We're
still trying to create a good structure so people who want to help can
get started easily.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> What's different about the community you see growing here?
</p><p>
DL: I think the younger generation of developers will include more Mac
fans or Mac types. They're a bit more aesthetically inclined, more
interested in the end-user experience. I see a future Open Source community
that can take Linux further mainstream. Look at things like Compiz Fusion,
Beryl&mdash;all that stuff. I had a chance to talk to Quinn Storm, the lead
developer on Compiz and Beryl. She wanted people in the Linux community to
make something end users could enjoy. After that conversation with
her,
I realized this was a growing community with a lot of promise.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Well, from an easy-to-use UI perspective, Apple has left the low end
open. Do you see Linux making a move there?
</p><p>
DL: Yes. There are quite a few Linux themes that adopt some of the good
things Apple has done on the UI. One remark I'd like to make on the
low end&mdash;I think Linux also got a fighting chance when Microsoft launched
Windows Vista. Vista pretty much obliterated the low-end hardware
experience for Windows. I've tried it, and it's a terrible experience. So,
there's an opportunity at the low end in general, because Apple continues to
be a luxury product and now, possibly to compete with Mac OS X, Microsoft
vacated the low-end space as well. We're happy about that.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> So what are your ambitions here? How do you plan to grow?
</p><p>
DL: We plan to expand our list of hardware partners in the US and abroad.
One of our long-term ambitions is to be a real friend to OEMs and the
hardware industry as a whole. We all know it's been tough to work with
Microsoft, and we thought there was a business opportunity to serve OEMs as
a &ldquo;Good OS&rdquo; company. We'll always continue to improve gOS in terms of
design and performance, and we'll also continue to package new Google and
open-source software that we think are relevant to people buying a
computer. We intend to keep gOS extremely lightweight, so as to keep the
overall hardware costs down. With all this coming together, another one
of our ambitions is to help close the digital divide with affordable
computing. There are many people in the world, some even in the US, who
don't have access to a computer and Internet. We think gOS needs to work
with Google, Web 2.0, open source and others to tackle this important
problem.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> How about laptops? Generic desktops are all the same. But laptops are
all different, by design, through OEM partnerships with Microsoft. What are
your plans there?
</p><p>
DL: One of the things that will make our laptops viable is software that
offers seamless syncing on-line and off. You are going to see gOS on laptops
very soon, if not by the time you read this.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> Are you partnered with other hardware companies?
</p><p>
DL: Right now, we're working with Everex, a single hardware partner, but the
goal is to expand to working with other companies as well. As a software
company, we really appreciate Everex and expect we'll be working with it
exclusively in the short term since this launch. We are talking to a few
hardware companies and are growing our team so we can work with more
hardware partners.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> I would think that Dell, Lenovo, HP and others would be looking at a
Linux offering in the cost range that you're working in, at some point.
Does that concern you?
</p><p>
DL: I think Dell was one of the big brands to launch a product, which is
good, but among the smaller PC companies, Everex is still one of the top
companies. It sells at Best Buy, Circuit City and Wal-Mart, yet it's small
enough to be motivated to experiment and take chances with a company like
ours. The larger hardware companies, such as Dell and HP, have a lot at
stake with Vista, and with the Microsoft relationship. It seems to us that a
company like Everex is less locked-down that way. So, we see companies like
Everex taking the first steps that need to be made to take Linux
mainstream.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> You were just in China. What were you working on there?
</p><p>
DL: I went to an O'Reilly Foo Camp&mdash;a gathering of techies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> What was your takeaway from the Foo Camp there?
</p><p>
DL: We talked about Web 2.0 and open source in China. Things are exciting
because we're seeing the same kind of Web 2.0 and Linux projects
successfully launch in China. It's exciting because China is in the very
early stages. Only a small minority of its population is on-line, and that
is already more than 110 million people. I think it's the second-largest
on-line
population to the US. There are huge opportunities there with Linux and
cloud computing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> People have been waiting for this segment to open up for a long time,
and I'm not just talking about the low end of the PC marketplace. I'm
talking about the browser as the environment for all kinds of applications.
Because, this is exactly what Netscape talked about doing way back in
1995. One of the reasons Microsoft came after Netscape was because
Netscape had the audacity to say the real desktop on the Net will be the
browser.
</p><p>
DL: The Netscape folks were super-advanced thinkers. I think it's going to
be really
exciting to see things unfold here. A lot of people have been saying Web
2.0 is a bubble, but I don't think so.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Doc:</b></span> I've said it's what we're going to call the next crash.
</p><p>
DL: Yeah, I think it definitely would be without cooperation from hardware.
But, what if hardware cooperates? It always takes hardware some time to
catch up to software. Hardware companies soon will need to give Web 2.0 a
serious look.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc:</b></span> What's the next big thing?
</p><p>
DL: I think it's Linux finally rising up, up into the cloud with Google and
Web 2.0. Then, a lot of these startups that we laughed at will find
themselves front and center for what's next in computing.
