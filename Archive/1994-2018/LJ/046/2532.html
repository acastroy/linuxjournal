    Our series winds up with a detailed description of the
    toolbox, plug-ins and keyboard acceleration.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2532f13.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265a6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p> Last month we talked about the Image
Window and Layers, two very important topics when learning about
the GIMP. Image Windows are where image processing work is
displayed and where you pick the elements of the image to be worked
on. Layers provide even more control over those selections. This
month we take a look at the Toolbox, the set of buttons that drives
most of the major processing tools, including various styles of
selections. We also look at using text and filters, and briefly
discuss scripting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265a7c0"></a>The Toolbox</h2></div></div><p>The most recent developer's release of the GIMP used for this
article included a more compact version of the Toolbox than earlier
versions. None of the tools were dropped, but the excess blank
areas in the buttons and menu bar were removed. This saves some
screen space on smaller displays, although I found it a little
hard, with my aging eyes, to make out some of the buttons on an
1152x900 display. Keep in mind that most tools and many features in
the GIMP are also accessible via keyboard accelerators, also known
as keyboard shortcuts. I'll only mention a few, but take note of
them when you experiment, as they help speed your work
tremendously.</p><p><a href="2532f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. The
Toolbox</b></span></a></p><p>The Toolbox is made up of buttons set in a seven row by three
column box, with a menu bar at the top and a foreground/background
color selection box at the bottom. The menu bar holds a File menu
similar to the one in the Image Window (although with fewer
options) and an Extensions menu. The latter allows you access to
the Script FU scripting interface. We'll get to that a little
later. The tools are selected by a single left-button mouse click
over the appropriate button. A double click opens the Tool Options
dialog window that provides access to configurable options for the
selected tool, if any are available.</p><p><a href="2532f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Selection Tools</b></span></a></p><p>The first row of buttons and the first two buttons in the
second row are the Selection Tools: Rectangular, Elliptical, Free
Hand, Fuzzy and Bezier. Rectangular and Elliptical draw the
respective type of outline as you drag the cursor, left mouse
button down, around the Image Window. Holding the
<b  >shift</b> key down while dragging will form a
uniform box or circle. Free Hand will draw an outline which follows
the path of the cursor as you drag it. Note that when you release
the mouse button while working with the Free Hand selection, the
selection is closed between the starting point and ending point of
the cursor's path. The Fuzzy select will select a region of an
image based on the colors in the region where you click with the
left mouse button. This sort of selection works best for images
that do not contain gradients or wide ranges of colors over very
small areas. The Bezier selection tool allows a region to be
outlined in precise detail. The Bezier tool was used to select
points on the outline of the monitors (after each point was
selected, a straight line was drawn connecting the last two points)
on the cover of the November issue, back when part one of this
series ran. Once a complete outline is selected, a single click on
the inside of the selected region activates that region and the
marching ants began their dance around the selection's outline.
Bezier selections can also be used to select outlines of very
jagged regions, but the method for doing so is beyond the scope of
this article. Note that all the Selection Tools have configurable
options. They all support anti-aliasing and user-defined feathered
regions.</p><p>The third button on the second row is the Intelligent
Scissors button. At the time of this writing that feature was not
yet supported.</p><p><a href="2532f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Move,
Magnify and Crop Tools</b></span></a></p><p>The third row of buttons holds the Move, Magnify and Crop
tools. The Move Tool allows a selected region or regions to be
moved. The Move tool is more sophisticated than it might seem at
first. When used with the Layers and Channels dialog, it becomes
possible to select various pieces of an image to adjust them within
the framework of the complete image.</p><p>The Magnify Tool is used to zoom in and out of the image.
This is useful for finding the edges of nearby objects in an image.
At times, you might bucket-fill a region only to find the fill
process covered more of the image than you expected. Using the zoom
tool might show that a tiny region of the fill area is not enclosed
by colors different from the fill region, indicating that the fill
process &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; into adjoining regions.</p><p>The Crop tool selects a region by boxing it out; hold down
the left mouse button, drag and release to select a region. A
dialog box will open giving the dimensions of the selected region.
At this point the region can be cropped; that is, the area outside
the boxed region is discarded and the Image Window is resized to
the area defined by the Crop Tool. All Layers are cropped to the
new dimension. Note that there are image filters which can also
perform various forms of cropping.</p><p><a href="2532f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Transform and Other Tools</b></span></a></p><p>Button one in row four is the Transform Tool. Select a region
or layer of the image and then click on the Transform Tool button.
Next, click inside the selected region or layer. The area will be
outlined with a rectangle and the corners will be outlined with
small, wireframe boxes. By default, the Transform Tool is
configured to perform rotations on the selected region. Double
clicking the Transform Tool button brings up the Tool Options
dialog where you can select one of Rotate, Scale, Shear or
Perspective for the selected region or layer. Scaling will work
with any selected area but be aware that scaling of text can, if
enlarged too much, cause aliasing (jagged edges) to occur. Click,
hold and drag the mouse inside the selected region in order to
perform the current transform.</p><p>The middle button of row four is the Flip tool. Click on this
button to flip a layer, image or selected region either
horizontally or vertically. The Tool Options dialog for this tool
provides the mechanism for selecting the direction of the flip. A
flip reverses the pixels of the area to be flipped&mdash;the rightmost
pixels end up on the leftmost side in a horizontal flip, and the
topmost pixels end up at the bottom in a vertical flip.</p><p>On the outside of the fourth row is the Text Tool. Clicking
once on this tool will enable the tool, but you need to click
inside an Image Window to bring up the Text Tool dialog. This
dialog is used to select the font characteristics of the text you
wish to insert in the image. The color of the text will match the
current foreground color, so be sure you have set the foreground
color (described in a later section on Colors) before clicking on
the OK button in the Text Tool dialog. Once you click on OK, the
Text Tool dialog closes, and the text is inserted in the image with
the marching ants (if enabled) dancing around the edges of the
text. At this point you can click on the Move Tool to move the text
to the desired location. Once you're familiar with the GIMP, you'll
find that it's not necessary to click on the Move Tool. However,
when first starting out, it's important to be familiar with the
current mode of GIMP operation by explicitly selecting the Tool of
interest.</p><p>An important note about adding text: text is inserted into an
image as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>floating selection</em></span>. Floating
selections have their own, temporary layer in the Layers and
Channels dialog. They require the user to select a disposition for
them before any further work can be done on other layers. A
floating selections disposition can be one of &ldquo;Anchor&rdquo; or
&ldquo;New&rdquo;. Anchoring a layer composites it with the current layer.
Marking a floating selection as a new layer adds it to the top of
the set of layers that make up the current image.</p><p>The next row is made up of the Color Picker Tool, the Bucket
Fill Tool and the Blend Tool from left to right. Colors in the GIMP
can be selected through the use of the Color Selection dialog which
allows fairly detailed selection of the Red, Green and Blue levels
along with HSV (hue, saturation and value) levels. However, if you
need to use a color that already exists in your image, the Color
Picker Tool, which resembles an eye dropper, is a much quicker way
to set the foreground color to the desired color. Click on the
Tool's button and then move the mouse over the pixel in the image
window which contains the color you wish to use. Important note: be
sure the layer in which that pixel lives is currently active. When
you click in the image window the foreground color is set to the
color of the pixel over which the mouse sits. The foreground
color's setting is shown in the box at the bottom of the Toolbox.
The two large boxes represent the current foreground (upper left)
and background (lower right) colors.</p><p>Filling a region of the image with either a solid color or a
pattern can be done using the Bucket Fill Tool. First, select a
region of an image using one of the Selection Tools (or use
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to select the entire active layer). Next,
double click the Bucket Fill Tool's button to bring up the Tool
Options dialog. If you want a solid color to fill the selected
region, click on the Color Fill toggle button. Select a color for
the foreground by double clicking on the foreground box at the
bottom of the Toolbox. The Color Selection dialog will open. Set
the color to Red, for example, and then click on OK in the Color
Selection dialog. Now, you're ready to fill in the selected region.
Simply click on the selected region, and the GIMP fills it with a
solid red pattern. You can also fill regions without selecting them
using the Fill Threshold slider in the Tool Options dialog for the
Bucket Fill Tool. The transparency amount can also be set prior to
doing the fill.</p><p>Instead of a solid color fill, you can also fill a region
with a given pattern. There are a host of default patterns
available with the GIMP. To choose a pattern you first click on the
Pattern Fill toggle in the Tool Options dialog for the Bucket Fill
Tool. Then place the mouse over the Image Window which will be
filled and type <b  >ctrl-shift-P</b> to open the
Patterns dialog. Click on one of the patterns to select it. Then
click on the selected region to have the GIMP fill it with the
selected pattern. If you create an interesting pattern you wish to
use for Pattern Fills, you can save it as a PAT file from the Save
Image dialog.</p><p><a href="2532f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Gradient Editor</b></span></a></p><p>The last tool in the fifth row of the Toolbox is the Blend
Tool. This tool is used for filling a region in a direction the
user specifies with a blended color pattern. The colors used can be
blended from foreground to background, foreground to transparent or
from a custom gradient provided by the Gradient Editor. The
Gradient Editor can be opened from the Image Windows pop down menus
as &ldquo;Dialogs<b  >-&gt;</b>Gradient Editor&rdquo;. There are a
number of default gradients that come with the distribution as well
as a number that have been created or collected by the Gradient
Editors author, Federico Mena Quintero, known affectionately to the
GIMP developers as Quartic. The resources section of this article
lists Quartic's web pages which are considered the definitive
resource for finding anything related to the GIMP, including more
custom gradients.</p><p>A full description of gradients would take many pages, but to
get an idea of what can be done with them, consider the cover art
for the November 1997 <i  >Linux Journal</i> shown at
the beginning of this article. The gold background is one gradient,
the colors of the stick man are another. Gradients are very useful
for creating all sorts of special effects.</p><p><a href="2532f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Pencil, Paintbrush and Other Tools</b></span></a></p><p>The next four buttons are the closest thing to drawing tools
the GIMP provides. They are, in order: the Pencil Tool, the
Paintbrush Tool, the Eraser Tool and the Airbrush Tool. Each of
these requires that a brush type be set. (There is a default
setting, but you'll find you'll wish to change this fairly often.)
The Brush Selection dialog allows selection of the brush type. Once
selected the brush type is applicable to each of the drawing tools.
The Pencil Tool draws solid lines that follow the shape of the
brush using hard edges. Using a brush like the Duck or Guitar
results in an effect similar to using a stencil. The Paintbrush
works similarly, although the edges of the stencil are much softer,
having been antialiased.</p><p><a href="2532f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.
Brushes</b></span></a></p><p>The Eraser Tool works just the opposite of the Pencil Tool in
that the shape of the brush is used to remove the underlying
pixels. Note that this does not mean the new color for the pixels
is the background color; instead, the pixels become transparent.
Finally, the Airbrush Tool works similarly to the Paintbrush but
acts as if the pattern is being blown onto the canvas at a given
rate and pressure.</p><p>All of the drawing tools use the current foreground color, to
do the drawing. If the brush type is not a solid pattern, the
darker areas of the brush come out in the foreground color, and the
lighter areas of the brush come out transparent (with the current
pixels showing through the area the brush doesn't cover). This
behavior can be modified using the Mode and Opacity settings on the
Brush Selection dialog. The dialog also allows you to specify how
fast the brush is applied using the Spacing setting. Lower spacing
values cause the brush to be repeated quickly, overlapping the
individual applications of the brush shape. Higher settings cause
the brush to be applied less often as the mouse is moved around the
Image Window.</p><p>Aside from the Airbrush tool, the bottom row of the Toolbox
also contains the Clone Tool. A rubber stamp icon represents this
tool in the Toolbox. This handy tool allows you to use one part of
an image to paint or &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; over another part of an image. This
is useful, for example, for removing the edges between pasted
objects or for clearing the edges in a tileable image. Tileable
images are ones which, when repeated side by side and top to
bottom, have no seams between the images, thus creating the
illusion of a solid image. Tileable images are often used as
background images for web pages.</p><p>To use the Clone Tool, click on the middle mouse button on
the bottom row of the Toolbox. Now, place the mouse over the Image
Window on the spot you wish to use as the beginning source
location. Hold down the control key and press the left mouse button
over this spot. A crosshair is displayed beneath the mouse pointer
to signify the source has been selected. Now move the mouse to
where you wish to begin cloning. The distance and angle between the
source and destination points will remain constant as you hold down
the left mouse button and drag it around the image. The area used
as the source will be the same size and shape as the current brush
type, so be sure to set it before beginning the cloning operation.
When removing edges in an image, use a brush type that has soft
edges; that is, edges that fade from black to white. The Nove brush
is good for this type of work. Note that the clone tool can also
use a pattern type, just like the Bucket Fill Tool. The use of the
pattern or the image as the source can be selected from the Clone
Tool's Tool Options dialog.</p><p>The last tool in the Toolbox is the Convolver Tool. This tool
can be used to sharpen or blur areas of an image; the choice is
made from the Convolver Tool's Tool Options dialog. Just select the
tool from the Toolbox and then start dragging the mouse around the
area of the image you wish to sharpen or blur. The operation is not
very obvious using the default settings, which have a Pressure
setting of 50 in the Tool Options Window. Play with it a bit to get
the hang of how much dragging is required for the desired effect.
Increasing the Pressure setting will cause the blurring to be more
obvious with less work on your part. The Convolver, along with the
Clone Tool, can be used to clean up sludges or to remove unwanted
lines and streaks from images.</p><p>At the bottom of the Toolbox window, you'll find the
Foreground/Background color selection box. This box contains two
large boxes, a two-ended arrow and two smaller boxes. The large
boxes are the foreground color and background color (top left to
bottom right, respectively). Clicking on either will open the Color
Selection dialog allowing you to set the current color. The
two-ended arrow allows you to swap the foreground and background
colors. The smaller boxes, below the foreground color box, reset
the colors to their default values.</p><p>Most operations use the foreground color for fill, paint and
drawing operations unless a pattern has been set. The color should
be set prior to clicking on the tool of interest or the results may
be unexpected. New layers can be created using the background color
as well, so be sure you've chosen the color you want prior to
creating the new layer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x265b9f8"></a>Selections</h2></div></div><p>One of the most important aspects of any tool like the GIMP
is the ability to select regions of an image to be processed.
Knowing the types of selections that are available and how to use
them will greatly enhance your use of the GIMP.</p><p>The simplest selection is the one which selects the entire
current layer. This particular selection can either be done via the
Image Window menus or by using the <b  >ctrl-A</b>
keyboard accelerator. Once selected, the region is surrounded by
the marching ants. Once a region is selected, it is important to
know how to turn off the selection. One method is to click on one
of the Selection Tools in the Toolbox and then click the left mouse
button in a region of the image that is not currently selected. In
the case where <b  >ctrl-A</b> was used to select the
entire layer, you need another way to turn off the selection since
there is no section of the image that is not selected. Again, the
Image Window menus and keyboard accelerators provide the answer.
<b  >shift-ctrl-A</b> turns off the selection. Note that
this will turn off any selection, not just those created with
<b  >ctrl-A</b>.</p><p>The Toolbox offers the five basic selection methods:
Rectangular, Elliptical, Free Hand, Fuzzy and Bezier. For those of
you who have used Adobe Photoshop, the Rectangular and Elliptical
selections are accessed from Photoshop using a single tool called
the Marquee. The Free Hand selection tool in the GIMP is referred
to as the Lasso in Photoshop. All of these work basically the same,
although the Tool Options dialogs in the GIMP look different than
their counterparts in Photoshop.</p><p>The Bezier selection tool in the GIMP is accessed via the
Lasso tool in Photoshop using Paths. In the GIMP the user creates
the paths for the selection using the tools in much the same manner
as the Free Hand tool except that control points are used to refine
the path of the selection. Fuzzy selections are based on the range
of pixel values over which the user drags the mouse. A fuzzy
selection can be used to select all regions with the same single
color or all regions which encompass a range of values.</p><p>There are a few additional features common to all of the
selection methods. First, all selections can be &ldquo;feathered&rdquo;. A
feathered selection means that the edge of the selection turns into
a fading pattern, from current image to transparent. The feathering
starts at the edge of the selection and continues out for the
specified number of pixels. Also, all Toolbox selections allow for
antialiasing, which reduces the jagged appearance of the selection
in some cases. Some selection tools provide a &ldquo;Sample Merged&rdquo;
option in the Tool Options dialog. This option allows the selection
to be taken based on the visible image and not just the currently
active layer.</p><p>Clearing a selection (available from the Image Window menus
as &ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Clear&rdquo;) removes the selected
region. The cleared area is transparent if the active layer
contains an Alpha channel. If it doesn't, the cleared area takes on
the background color. Filling a selection
(&ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Fill&rdquo; from the Image Windows menus)
will fill a selection to the background color. Selections can be
extended by holding down the <b  >shift</b> key while
performing another selection. They can be reduced or otherwise have
sections removed by holding down the control
(<b  >ctrl</b>) key while performing another
selection.</p><p>There are a number of other options available for selections,
such as selecting regions by color, or extending and shrinking
selections. All of these are available from the Selections submenu
in the Image Window's pop-down menu. One of the newer features is
the ability to snap selections to the Ruler Guides. The
&ldquo;View<b  >-&gt;</b>Snap To Guides&rdquo; menu option toggles
the snap action on or off.</p><p>Selections can be moved, rotated, flipped, filled, cut,
pasted and have any of the filters applied. The selection applies
only to the active layer, but whatever process was applied to a
single layer can be repeated by simply selecting a different layer,
leaving the selection outline in place, and then choosing the
&ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Redo&rdquo; option from the Image Window
menus. Selections, once moved in any manner, become floating layers
in the Layers and Channels dialog. You must make sure this floating
layer is given a final disposition&mdash;either making it a new layer or
anchoring it the currently active layer&mdash;before continuing with
your work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x2652968"></a>Text</h2></div></div><p>One of the most useful aspects of the GIMP is its ability to
manipulate text. Logos, cover art and birthday cards are all
possible given the many features provided by the GIMP. In order to
add text to your images, you first need to understand how the GIMP
gets access to text fonts.</p><p>The GIMP is based on Xlib and as such has access to the font
rendering engines within the X server. This normally means that the
GIMP has access to one of two types of fonts: Bitmap and Postscript
Type 1 fonts. The former are not widely distributed (such as on
commercial CDs from a software store like CompUSA or Egghead
Software). My experience has been that you shouldn't bother with
these types unless you happen to be given one. Conversely,
Postscript Type 1, more commonly referred to simply as Type1, fonts
are quite common. I've purchased at least four different CDs with
literally thousands of Type1 fonts on them for use with Linux and X
Window System applications. In order to make use of these fonts,
you need to install them on your system and inform the X server. My
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Graphics Muse</em></span> column in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span> (Issue 14, February 1997) had an article on how
to do this titled &ldquo;Adding Fonts To Your System&rdquo;. Note that an
additional format, TrueType, can also be used if you have a font
server available for use. Caldera ships a font server with their
packages, but most of the other distributions do not. Font servers
have, in general, always been an additional package purchased
separately for X servers on Linux systems.</p><p><a href="2532f8.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 8. Text
Tool Dialog Window</b></span></a></p><p>Once you've gotten the fonts installed and available under X,
you're ready to use them in the GIMP. The Text Tool in the Toolbox
provides access to the fonts and is used to insert text into
images. Figure 6 shows the Text Tool dialog window. When you click
on the Text Tool button in the Toolbox and then click in the Image
Window, the Text Tool dialog opens. If you have a large number of
fonts installed on your system, the dialog will not open
immediately the first time you access it&mdash;wait a moment or two as
it gathers information about the available fonts. Subsequent
invocations of the tool will not take so long, as the GIMP caches
the information about fonts for better efficiency.</p><p>The Text Tool dialog provides a scrollable window that lists
the available fonts by name, sorted alphabetically. Below this
window is a window for typing the text you wish to add to the
image. A limitation in the current implementation requires the text
to be a single line (no carriage returns), so multiline text has to
be created one line at a time. Fortunately, the addition of Guides
(from the Image Window's Rulers) allows a fairly good way to line
the text up.</p><p>The only other part of this dialog that you'll find yourself
using regularly is the Size setting. The size value is a text field
that you can type in to set the size of the font. Next to this is
an options menu. This menu has two options: Pixels and Points. The
difference isn't completely clear to me, so I use Pixels most of
the time. I expect, when I become more educated as to the use of
these settings, I'll find a need for the Points option. The Size
value, however, is an item I use quite often. Note that when you
type in a new size and press <b  >enter</b>, the text
field at the bottom of the dialog is adjusted to reflect the new
size. Also note that the text in this field is not antialiased,
even if the Antialiasing toggle button in the dialog is set (it's
set when the toggle appears depressed). The antialiasing setting
only affects the way the text is displayed in the image.</p><p>When you have finished setting up the font type, size and
text, click on the OK button to apply the text to the image. As I
stated earlier, the text is applied to a floating layer and can be
moved around that floating layer. When the text is applied in this
way, it is presented in the Image Window with the marching ants
outline and a transparent (i.e., the underlying image is visible)
body. When the cursor is placed over the transparent section
(anywhere inside the marching ants) the text can be moved. For some
fonts and sizes, it becomes very difficult to find the body of the
text with the mouse pointer. In these cases, click on the Zoom Tool
and then click by the text to zoom in on it. Once the text is more
accessible to the pointer, you can select the Move Tool from the
Toolbox and proceed to move the text around the image. When you
have finished, be sure to create the new layer or anchor it to the
current layer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x2652e38"></a>Filters aka Plug-Ins</h2></div></div><p>After all this, we've finally come to a place where we can
talk about filters. Much of your image work will be based on
filters, also referred to as Plug-Ins. These are external programs
called by the GIMP to process part or all of the current layer of a
given image window. Filters use the GIMP's Plug-In API (application
programming interface) to access image data via shared memory.
Although the filters are external programs, they cannot be used
outside the GIMP.</p><p>Quite a number of filters are now delivered as part of the
core GIMP package. They can be placed either in the system plug-in
directories, usually
/usr/local/lib/gimp/<span   class="emphasis"><em>release</em></span>/plug-ins or in the
users .gimp/plug-ins directory. When the GIMP starts, it will query
the plug-ins for necessary information so that the menu options can
be built. Consequently, when you've added large numbers of plug-ins
to these directories, the GIMP can take a bit of time to get
started. Using the default set of filters, start-up time isn't too
bad on a Pentium 133MHz system.</p><p>All of the filters are accessed through the Image Windows
Filters menu option. Filters are broken into a number of categories
ranging from Blurs to Distorts to Rendering options. Some filters
work on the existing image directly, modifying the existing pixels
based on the plug-ins function. For example, a blur looks at the
pixels in an image and samples those that are near each other to
produce a blurred effect. The pixels sampled can be either the
whole image or a selected region. Other filters, such as
IFSCompose, create new images in the current layer, so you may wish
to either start with a completely new image or at least a new layer
before running these filters. Experimentation is the key&mdash;play with
the filters on stock images to see how they effect it and its
layers.</p><p><a href="2532f9.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 9. Bump

Bump Map Image</b></span></a></p><p>I've included samples of just two of the filters: IFS Compose
and Bump Map. The latter is an interesting 3D effect that is easily
added to 2D images. The IFS Compose is a fractal-based tool that
can be used to create some rather stunning images. I've played with
this tool quite a bit and am still amazed at the range of effects
that are possible. One important thing to remember about IFS
Compose&mdash;you can add and delete the control triangles. For the
longest time I simply played with the default three triangles.
Adding triangles allows even greater flexibility to the
effects.</p><p><a href="2532f11.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 11.

language, Script FU. This is a Scheme-based scripting language that
allows you to string sets of filters and other GIMP internal
commands and tools together to create interesting effects. A set of
predefined scripts is distributed with the core GIMP package. Many
of these are used to create very interesting logos.</p><p>Scripts make use of an internal database of routines that
have been registered for use by plug-ins and scripts. This database
is called the Procedural Database or PDB. There is at least one
script available for browsing the database. All the routines in the
database are registered by plug-ins or the GIMP itself using a set
of parameters that allow it to be self documenting. The PDB browser
prints this information in a window showing the inputs and outputs
for the routine, the author and a short descriptive blurb.</p><p>I'm not a big fan of Scheme, but that's mostly because I'm
getting old, crotchety and tired of learning the language du jour.
There is hope, however, for people like me. The GIMP's scripting
language is just one example of a GIMP Extension. Extensions can be
written by anyone, much like plug-ins, but the details are a bit
beyond my understanding right now. I do know that at least one
other scripting language extension has been written&mdash;for Tcl.
Unfortunately, I don't know that language either. Ah, well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2562580.0x2653678"></a>Keyboard Accelerators and GTK</h2></div></div><p>Finally, I think I should mention one of the lesser known but
really nifty features of the GIMP. Actually, it's not really part
of the GIMP, it's part of GTK, the windowing toolkit upon which the
GIMP is based. Most windowing systems have keyboard accelerators,
or keyboard shortcuts, that allow you access to window features
directly from the keyboard. This is also true of GTK; however, GTK
goes one step beyond. Other toolkits allow developers to predefine
the accelerators in the source code or allow users to define them
in configuration scripts used by the toolkits at start up time. GTK
allows the user to set the accelerators <span   class="emphasis"><em>at run
time</em></span>--you simply move the mouse over the menu item you
wish to set, making sure the menu option is active (don't click the
mouse on it, just move the cursor over it) and press the keystroke
you wish to use for the keyboard accelerator. For example, moving
the mouse over the &ldquo;File<b  >-&gt;</b>Print&rdquo; option in
the Image Windows menus, I press <b  >ctrl-P</b> to set
the keyboard accelerator for printing. Now, instead of having to go
to the menu option, I just type <b  >ctrl-P</b> over the
image I wish to print.</p><p>Changes to the accelerators are saved between sessions, so
you don't have to redo them each time you start the GIMP. You
should be able to disable the accelerator by typing the same
keystroke, but that didn't seem to work in the version I had. If a
menu option already has an accelerator, just type the new key
strokes to change it. This is a pretty nifty feature, as it puts
more control in the hands of the user. As an X programmer by trade,
I can say this is definitely a design goal of windowing application
developers.</p><p><a href="2532s1.html" target="_self">Resources on the Net</a></p></div></div>
