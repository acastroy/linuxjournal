    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1053580.0x114b1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our focus this month is databases. Most
of the articles discuss freely available databases; however, we
don't want to forget all of the commercial databases available for
Linux. So, I thought I'd mention a few here, along with the month
we published reviews or articles about them to give you a point of
reference for more information. Solid Technology's Solid Server won
our Readers' Choice Award for favorite database in December 1997
and was reviewed in our September 1997 issue. Also, in September,
we had reviews of Empress RDBMS for professionals and Just
Logic/SQL RDBMS. The Raima Database Manager and Velocis Server were
reviewed in December and, in October, were featured in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means Business</em></span> column about Grundig TV.
</p><p>There are, of course, more commercial databases that we have
not reviewed such as Adabas, C-tree Plus and Yard (upcoming)--and
those aren't all. It's quite amazing when you start counting just
how many databases do support Linux. A database is one of the basic
&ldquo;must have&rdquo; applications for any business, so it is good to see
so many supporting Linux.</p><p>As to the &ldquo;big 2&rdquo;, Sybase and Oracle: Sybase sells an
official Linux version but refuses to support it, and Oracle has
had an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; port to Linux for some time that they neither
support nor sell. Those of you who work for Linux companies that
need the size and robustness offered by these two databases should
let the companies know that there is a market for Linux versions
and that supporting them would be worthwhile.</p><p>In the September, October and November installments of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>At the Forge</em></span>, Reuven Lerner told us all about
another free database, MySQL. The programmers working on MySQL
(http://www.tcx.se/) have been working on a comprehensive benchmark
suite. It is written in Perl using the DBI/DBD interface so that it
can be used easily for a wide range of databases. All of the
benchmarks generate tables of data and are configurable to fit
different needs. For more information visit the MySQL web site or
write David Axmark at david@detron.se.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1053580.0x114b4a8"></a>Linux in the News</h2></div></div><p>A very interesting article about Linux appeared in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Network World</em></span>, October 13, 1997. The article
is &ldquo;Linux Flexes its Internet Muscle&rdquo; by John Cox and can be
found on the Web at http://www.nwfusion.com/news/1013linux.html. In
it, Mr. Cox discusses the Corel Computer Corporation announcement
that Corel is using Linux as the operating system for its new Video
Network Computer. He also mentions other companies that have
switched to Linux and why. I am very happy to see Linux receive
this kind of publicity and to see companies talking about their use
of Linux and why they chose it over other operating systems.</p><p>The Corel Computer announcement has been quite exciting to
everyone in the Linux community&mdash;I've received a lot of mail from
people making sure I heard about it. More information on Corel
Computer's use of the Linux operating system can be found in their
press release at
http://www.corelcomputer.com/news/press/vnc_october97.htm. We will
be publishing an interview with Corel's president, Mr. Eid Eid, in
our April issue which will focus on workplace solutions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1053580.0x114b660"></a>86Open</h2></div></div><p>Another interesting item that has been brought to my
attention is the 86open project. This group has come up with a
standard for creating software that will run without modification
or emulation on any Unix/Intel platform, including Linux, BSDI,
FreeBSD, SCO OpenServer, Sunsoft SolarisX86 and SCO UnixWare. For
more information on this project, see the web site
http://www.telly.org/86open/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1053580.0x114b768"></a>University of Washington Computer Fair</h2></div></div><p>For those of you who will be in the Seattle area March 18 and
19, UW is holding its 24th annual Computer Fair. It is the oldest
and largest computer show in the Pacific Northwest, bringing
together people from the University and the community for
presentations and demonstrations of state-of-the-art computer
equipment, software and support materials. Exhibits and seminars
are designed to show how computer and network technologies can
change the way we learn, communicate and work. Better yet, it is
free. For more information write compfair@u.washington.edu or visit
the web site at http://www.washington.edu/compfair/.</p></div></div>
