    A view of life with a hacker brought to us by a mischievous
    spouse who should know&mdash;Ms. Gwynne is married to Alan Cox.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1275580.0x136d450"></a></h2></div></div><p> I have just celebrated my fifth wedding
anniversary to a hacker. Happily, there aren't many things I would
change. I feel the past five years have given me some experiences
that are only fair to pass on to those contemplating marriage to a
Linux hacker&mdash;a few little tips on how life will be. I have used
the pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; for the hacker because my hacker is male, but I
have been assured by others that the following description is a
fairly standard one regardless of gender.
</p><p>When you shout three times for your spouse and require an
answer, don't expect the answer to return immediately. He will
reply, but only when his brain has finished with the problem it is
currently working through. If this problem is conveyed to the brain
via a computer screen, it becomes a &ldquo;Very Important Problem&rdquo; and
requires up to an hour of grokking before answering questions such
as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What do you want for tea?</p></li><li><p>It's your mother on the phone&mdash;do you want a
word?</p></li><li><p>Are you coming to your parents' silver wedding
anniversary party? If so, the train is leaving in five
minutes.</p></li></ul></div><p>Your spouse may have problems with rational
time-management&mdash;or, more accurately, with the less-than-rational
world. As far as a hacker is concerned, if it is Friday night, it
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the time to consider the quantity of
clean work clothes which must be available for Monday morning. In
fact, if it is Friday night, it is time for an extended hacking
session because getting up for work the next day is not necessary.
Saturday mornings, consequently, are a great time for getting
things done which do not require help from your spouse.</p><p>The concentration powers of a hacker are a problem in
everyday life. If Dr. Who is on the television, your hacker is not
going to notice that it is raining and the clothes on the outside
line are getting wet. After all, Dr. Who requires maximum
concentration.</p><p>If you take your hacker to any films which involve computers
in any way whatsoever, do not expect any appreciation of the plot,
the music or the direction. I took my husband, a hacker-friend and
my non-hacker sister to see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beauty and the
Beast</em></span>. I was glad my sister was with us to share my
discussion of the film's qualities, as when the film had finished,
the other two began discussing ray-projection and its application
to just about every scene in the film. Similarly, we left
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Net</em></span> early, because it was boring (to me)
and non-logical (to him). And as for that wretched
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Terminator</em></span>...</p><p>Food provided by your hacker-partner will either be sloppy
and messy (he was thinking hard at the time) or incredibly precise
and technically excellent. Washing up, however, is a one-banana job
to be left to the operator (spouse).</p><p>In a romantic interlude at a restaurant, be very sure that
you actually want to know the answer when you gaze into his distant
eyes and ask &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; For the answer will
most likely not be &ldquo;You.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked &ldquo;do you want to do this or do that,&rdquo; your hacker
partner will consider it perfectly acceptable to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
rather than selecting one of the options. Do not panic! This can be
extremely useful at times. Consider the following example: you ask,
&ldquo;Do you wish to pay for the paper or the new bookshelves?&rdquo; He
says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Later, when you present him with the bookshelf bill
and he wonders why, you say, &ldquo;I asked which you wanted to pay. You
said yes and didn't pay the papers, so I assumed you wished to pay
for the new bookshelf.&rdquo;</p><p>Some other partners may be able to explain gardening with a
hacker better than me, but I know there are three vital things to
note in this area. The first is to ensure your partner understands
that Nature has root privileges&mdash;Nature doesn't have to make sense.
The second is to let him know that planting seeds in a straight
line is boring. The third thing he should understand is that three
miniscule crumbs of soil dropped on a kitchen surface do not
constitute a public health emergency. If your partner is foolish
enough to mutter &ldquo;that surface ought to be sterilised before using
it again,&rdquo; point him in the direction of the cupboard under the
sink and invite him to acquaint himself with the process, since
you've been doing it unnoticed every week.</p><p>As to house maintenance, does it involve problem-solving? If
so, your hacker can safely be left to deal with the planning (for
the amusement value, if nothing else). However, intervention may be
required. Your hacker may wish to adapt a household item to another
use for which it was not intended, as he does with chunks of code.
Sadly, however, /home/tools, once edited, cannot be returned to its
original state and purpose.</p><p>Finally, here's one tip for all you hackers. Remember: while
root can do most everything, there are certain privileges that only
a partner can grant.</p></div></div>
