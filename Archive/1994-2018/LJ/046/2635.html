    S.u.S.E. is well worth the $49 US price tag.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x2983500"></a></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Manufacturer: S.u.S.E.</p></li><li><p>E-mail: info@suse.com</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.suse.com/</p></li><li><p>Price: $49 US</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Stuart Green</p></li></ul></div><p>When I arrived home following the ALG (Austin Linux Group)
meeting of August 28, there in the kitchen sat a rather large box
from S.u.S.E. Being of sound disposition and sober manner, I tore
the box open. Inside were a boot diskette, four CDs in a single
jewel box and a 380 plus page manual. The packaging was of good
quality and shrink-wrapped as if it were sitting on a shelf at a
computer retailer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x29839d0"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The manual is excellent. This is the finest piece of
comprehensive documentation I have seen. It includes practical and
detailed setup instructions for services, such as firewalling,
rational sendmail configuration, emulator setups (and many
emulators such as DOS, Atari, Nintendo, CBM from the PET to the
VIC-20, Sinclair/Timex, Gameboy and others).</p><p>The highly detailed table of contents and comprehensive index
are rare in this type of documentation. Not only is information
accessible, but it is presented very clearly. There are minor
errors in translation from the German, including the presence of
some characters unique to that language being left as is, in
particular, in the names of individuals. These mistakes are easy to
overlook. An unusual and very appreciated aspect of this manual is
that it consists of original material and does not contain reprints
of the LDP (Linux Documentation Project) HOWTOs. The manual's
thoroughness is aptly complemented by the clarity and accessibility
of the material. The manual alone is worth the price of
admission.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x2983b30"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>The sheer amount of code available within this distribution
is daunting&mdash;three of the four CD-ROMs are installation media. The
fourth is a live file system that can be loaded in a demo mode that
uses very little disk space. The explanation of how to permanently
set up a small Linux partition and how to use the live file system
to have a complete installation contains an accessible and cogent
discussion of inode density, or how to cram 40,000 symbolic links
into a partition.</p><p>S.u.S.E. has included utilities from Caldera and Red Hat;
specifically Netware connectivity and Red Hat's RPM (Red Hat
Package Management). The utilization of RPM, which is evolving into
the de facto standard for installation, maintenance and replacement
of software packages, is admirable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x2983c90"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>I installed it on a variety of machines: a P166, a K6-166 and
a PPro-II running at 300MHz. Kernel compile times were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>P-166: 7 minutes 15 seconds (64MB memory)</p></li><li><p>K6-166: 6 minutes 12 seconds (64MB memory)</p></li><li><p>PPro-II: 2 minutes 43 seconds (96MB memory)</p></li></ul></div><p>The system-level information available is the most thorough I
have encountered in any operating system. The disk information, for
example, contains the actual disk geometry as well as the LBA
translations, the amount of physical cache on the disk and the
manufacturer's information down to the device serial number. The
same can be said for this utility's output regarding any physical
device, e.g., the screens for the networking card go to the level
of reading the registers for networking statistics on the card. I
find this information of great value in diagnosing networking
problems, as well as for installation ease. The S.u.S.E.
environment contains only software available under the GPL (GNU
Public License); there are no commercial X servers or window
managers. The overall product seems to be quite complete.</p><p>As is the usual case the printed documentation is behind the
actual code, so don't rely on the printed instructions to be
consistent with what is on the screen at all times. The process is
well documented on the screen. The only confusing point is the
order of the process. Like all Unix installations, the first step
is preparing the storage media by partitioning and/or making file
systems. Under S.u.S.E. this process is accomplished within a
cleanly presented screen that requires using the function keys for
selection of mount points, formatting options (inode density and
bad block checking), etc. I found that the level of options is far
above other distributions and, unlike some, S.u.S.E. does
install.</p><p>The installation is simplicity itself. Once the machine is
booted using the enclosed diskette, a series of questions is asked.
The install process begins by prompting for the insertion of the
first CD-ROM. It loads all selected packages from that CD-ROM and
then boots into the newly installed system to complete the
installation. It works well&mdash;it is a solid installer. The
installation process is quick&mdash;a base installation taking a little
over half an hour with reboots and all. The entire process is as
smooth as an installation of this sort on Wintel architecture is
going to be. Linux will not install with the ease of Solaris or
Irix; but those are captive machines, where the manufacturer has
total control of the hardware and choices are rather small.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x2984108"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The best part is available after the installation is
completed. Bringing up YaST (yet another setup tool) and choosing
&ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; brings up a selector menu that looks like the
&ldquo;Check Config&rdquo; utility in SGI's Irix and is similar to the
configuration tools within System V Release 4. On systems running
an unlinked kernel, most configuration is done this way. S.u.S.E.
has managed to bring the same, sane method to Linux. In order to
use this feature the S.u.S.E.-modified sources need be
loaded.</p><p>I have not reorganized my disks to accommodate another Linux
distribution yet, so I started with the &ldquo;demo&rdquo; mode using the
file system on the CD. It worked, albeit with some
pains&mdash;especially speed&mdash;almost all the user-level programs are on
the CD. Regardless of which keyboard is chosen in YaST, once the
live file system is loaded, the keyboard reverted to a German
layout. I found this to be a real irritant. X configuration is
simple and quick with the XFree86-3.3 version of XF86Setup. Once
the X server is up, the environment presents a wide range of
options&mdash;including dynamically switching window managers from
<span   class="bold"><b>fvwm2</b></span> to
<span   class="bold"><b>olvwm</b></span> to an
<span   class="bold"><b>mwm</b></span> clone to AfterStep.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x288b580.0x2984370"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>S.u.S.E. is well worth the $49 US price tag. It is also
available as a subscription, for $34 US a pop with 3 releases per
year expected, that can be canceled at any time. This is a
full-featured distribution without commercial packages. There are
quite a number of demos of commercial software included, but no
fully functional packages, which keeps the price low. The
installation is fast and fairly easy to use. With few reservations
I'd recommend this system for users with experience ranging from
modest to advanced. The installation requires slightly more Unix
exposure than Red Hat 4.2, and since there is an exceptional number
of options, it is better suited to those who have done some
hacking. It is stable.</p><p>Perceived performance is on par with Red Hat 4.2 and Caldera
Standard. X installation is surprisingly quick, especially when one
considers the amount of additional programming that S.u.S.E. loads.
(S.u.S.E. loads and configures multiple window managers and desktop
paradigms). The kernel tuning process is identical with other
distributions. There are two sets of kernel sources&mdash;the straight
Linux code and the S.u.S.E.-modified code. I used the
S.u.S.E.-modified sources so I could access the configuration
utilities, which are most certainly worth loading. S.u.S.E. updates
are built in RPM format and are available at their FTP site. The
lag time between bug reports and updated code seems to be in the
two week range, which is as good as, if not better than, most
commercial operating systems. This is definitely a competitive
system worth consideration.</p><p><a href="2635s1.html" target="_self">S.u.S.E. v5.1 News</a></p></div></div>
