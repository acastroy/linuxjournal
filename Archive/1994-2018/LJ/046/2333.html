    This is the first of a series of articles about how to
    devlop networked applications using the various interfaces
    available on Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xecd6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Like most other Unix-based operating
systems, Linux supports TCP/IP as its native network transport. In
this series, we will assume you are fairly familiar with C
programming on Linux and with Linux topics such as signals,
forking, etc.
</p><p>This article is a basic introduction to using the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BSD socket interface</em></span> for creating networked
applications. In the next article, we will deal with issues
involved in creating (network) daemon processes. Future articles
will cover using remote procedure calls and developing with
CORBA/distributed objects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xecd870"></a>Brief Introduction to TCP/IP</h2></div></div><p>The TCP/IP suite of protocols allows two applications,
running on either the same or separate computers connected by a
network, to communicate. It was specifically designed to tolerate
an unreliable network. TCP/IP allows two basic modes of
operation&mdash;connection-oriented, reliable transmission and
connectionless, unreliable transmission (TCP and UDP respectively).
Figure 1 illustrates the distinct protocol layers in the TCP/IP
suite stack.</p><p><a href="2333f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
TCP/IP Protocol Layers</b></span></a></p><p>TCP provides sequenced, reliable, bi-directional,
connection-based bytestreams with transparent retransmission. In
English, TCP breaks your messages up into chunks (not greater in
size than 64KB) and ensures that all the chunks get to the
destination without error and in the correct order. Being
connection-based, a virtual connection has to be set up between one
network entity and the other before they can communicate. UDP
provides (very fast) connectionless, unreliable transfer of
messages (of a fixed maximum length).</p><p>To allow applications to communicate with each other, either
on the same machine (using loopback) or across different hosts,
each application must be individually addressable.</p><p>TCP/IP addresses consist of two parts&mdash;an IP address to
identify the machine and a port number to identify particular
applications running on that machine.</p><p>The addresses are normally given in either the
&ldquo;dotted-quad&rdquo; notation (i.e., <b  >127.0.0.1</b>) or as
a host name (<b  >foobar.bundy.org</b>). The system can
use either the /etc/hosts file or the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Domain Name
Service</em></span> (DNS) (if available) to translate host names to
host addresses.</p><p>Port numbers range from 1 upwards. Ports between 1 and
IPPORT_RESERVED (defined in /usr/include/netinet/in.h&mdash;typically
1024) are reserved for system use (i.e., you must be root to create
a server to bind to these ports).</p><p>The simplest network applications follow the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>client-server</em></span> model. A server process waits
for a client process to connect to it. When the connection is
established, the server performs some task on behalf of the client
and then usually the connection is broken.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xecddf0"></a>Using the BSD Socket Interface</h2></div></div><p>The most popular method of TCP/IP programming is to use the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BSD socket interface</em></span>. With this, network
endpoints (IP address and port number) are represented as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sockets</em></span>.</p><p>The socket interprocess communication (IPC) facilities
(introduced with 4.2BSD) were designed to allow network-based
applications to be constructed independently of the underlying
communication facilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xece000"></a>Creating a Server Application</h2></div></div><p>To create a server application using the BSD interface, you
must follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create a new socket by typing:
<b  >socket()</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>bind</em></span> an address (IP address
and port number) to the socket by typing: <b  >bind</b>.
This step identifies the server so that the client knows where to
go.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>listen</em></span> for new connection
requests on the socket by typing:
<b  >listen()</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>accept</em></span> new connections by
typing: <b  >accept()</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Often, the servicing of a request on behalf of a client may
take a considerable length of time. It would be more efficient in
such a case to accept and deal with new connections while a request
is being processed. The most common way of doing this is for the
server to <span   class="emphasis"><em>fork</em></span> a new copy of itself after
accepting the new connection.</p><p><a href="2333f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Representation of Client/Server Code</b></span></a></p><p>The code example in <a href="2333l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a> shows how servers are implemented in C. The program
expects to be called with only one command-line argument: the port
number to bind to. It then creates a new socket to listen on using
the <span   class="bold"><b>socket()</b></span> system call. This
call takes three parameters: the <span   class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span> in
which to listen to, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>socket type</em></span> and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>network protocol</em></span>.</p><p>The domain can be either the PF_UNIX domain (i.e., internal
to the local machine only) or the PF_INET (i.e., all requests from
the Internet). The socket type specifies the communication
semantics of the connection. While a few types of sockets have been
specified, in practice, SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM are the most
popular implementations. SOCK_STREAM provides for TCP reliable
connection-oriented communications, SOCK_DGRAM for UDP
connectionless communication.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span> parameter identfies the
particular protocol to be used with the socket. While multiple
protocols may exist within a given protocol family (or domain),
there is generally only one. For TCP this is IPPROTO_TCP, for UDP
it is IPPROTO_UDP. You do not have to explicitly specify this
parameter when making the function call. Instead, using a value of
0 will select the default protocol.</p><p>Once the socket is created, its operation can be tweaked by
means of socket options. In the above example, the socket is set to
reuse old addresses (i.e., IP address + port numbers) without
waiting for the required connection close timeout. If this were not
set, you would have to wait four minutes in the TIME_WAIT state
before using the address again. The four minutes comes from 2 *
MSL. The recommended value for MSL, from RFC 1337, is 120 seconds.
Linux uses 60 seconds, BSD implementations normally use around 30
seconds.</p><p>The socket can linger to ensure that all data is read, once
one end closes. This option is turned on in the code. The structure
of <span   class="bold"><b>linger</b></span> is defined in
/usr/include/linux/socket.h. It looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct linger
{
        int l_onoff;   /* Linger active */
        int l_linger;  /* How long to linger */
};
</pre><p>If <b  >l_onoff</b> is zero, lingering is disabled.
If it is non-zero, lingering is enabled for the socket. The
<b  >l_linger</b> field specifies the linger time in
seconds.
</p><p>The server then tries to discover its own host name. I could
have used the <span   class="bold"><b>gethostname()</b></span> call,
but the use of this function is deprecated in <span   class="emphasis"><em>SVR4
Unix</em></span> (i.e., Sun's Solaris, SCO Unixware and buddies), so
the local function <span   class="bold"><b>_GetHostName()</b></span>
provides a more portable solution.</p><p>Once the host name is established, the server constructs an
address for the socket by trying to resolve the host name to an
Internet domain address, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>gethostbyname()</b></span> call. The server's
IP address could instead be set to INADDR_ANY to allow a client to
contact the server on any of its IP addresses&mdash;used, for example,
with a machine with multiple network cards or multiple addresses
per network card.</p><p>After an address is created, it is bound to the socket. The
socket can now be used to listen for new connections. The BACK_LOG
specifies the maximum size of the listen queue for pending
connections. If a connection request arrives when the listen queue
is full, it will fail with a connection refused error. [This forms
the basis for one type of denial of service attack &mdash;Ed.] See
sidebar on TCP <span   class="bold"><b>listen()</b></span>
Backlog.</p><p>Having indicated a willingness to listen to new connection
requests, the socket then prepares to accept the requests and
service them. The example code achieves this using an infinite
<span   class="bold"><b>for()</b></span> loop. Once a connection has
been accepted, the server can ascertain the address of the client
for logging or other purposes. It then forks a child copy of itself
to handle the request while it (the parent) continues listening for
and accepting new requests.</p><p>The child process can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>read()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>write()</b></span> system calls on this
connection to communicate with the client. It is also possible to
use the buffered I/O on these connections (e.g.,
<span   class="bold"><b>fprint()</b></span>) as long as you remember
to <span   class="bold"><b>fflush()</b></span> the output when
necessary. Alternatively, you can disable buffering altogether for
the process (see the <span   class="bold"><b>setvbuf() (3)</b></span>
man page).</p><p>As you can see from the code, it is quite common (and good
practice) for the child processes to close the inherited
parent-socket file descriptor, and for the parent to close the
child-socket descriptor when using this simple forking
model.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0x12c75e8"></a>Creating the Corresponding Client</h2></div></div><p>The client code, shown in <a href="2333l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>, is a little simpler than the corresponding server code.
To start the client, you must provide two command-line arguments:
the host name or address of the machine the server is running on
and the port number the server is bound to. Obviously, the server
must be running before any client can connect to it.</p><p>In the client example (Listing 2), a socket is created like
before. The first command-line argument is first assumed to be a
host name for the purposes of finding the server's address. If this
fails, it is then assumed to be a dotted-quad IP address. If this
also fails, the client cannot resolve the server's address and will
not be able to contact it.</p><p>Having located the server, an address structure is created
for the client socket. No explicit call to
<span   class="bold"><b>bind()</b></span> is needed here, as the
<span   class="bold"><b>connect()</b></span> call handles all of
this.</p><p>Once the connect() returns successfully, a duplex connection
has been established. Like the server, the client can now use
read() and write() calls to receive data on the connection.</p><p>Be aware of the following points when sending data over a
socket connection:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Sending text is usually fine. Remember that
different systems can have different conventions for the end of
line (i.e., Unix is <b  >\012</b>, whereas Microsoft uses
<b  >\015\012</b>).</p></li><li><p>Different architectures may use different
byte-ordering for integers etc. Thankfully, the BSD guys thought of
this problem already. There are routines
(<span   class="bold"><b>htons</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nstoh</b></span> for short integers,
<span   class="bold"><b>htonl</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ntohl</b></span> for long integers) which
perform host-to-network order and network-to-host order
conversions. Whether the network order is little-endian or
big-endian doesn't really matter. It has been standardized across
all TCP/IP network stack implementations. Unless you persistently
pass only characters across sockets, you will run into byte-order
problems if you do not use these routines. Depending on the machine
architecture, these routines may be null macros or may actually be
functional. Interestingly, a common source of bugs in socket
programming is to forget to use these byte-ordering routines for
filling the address field in the sock_addr structures. Perhaps it
is not intuitively obvious, but this must also be done when using
INADDR_ANY (i.e., htonl(INADDR_ANY)).</p></li><li><p>A key goal of network programming is to ensure
processes do not interfere with each other in unexpected ways. In
particular, servers must use appropriate mechanisms to serialize
entry through critical sections of code, avoid deadlock and protect
data validity.</p></li><li><p>You cannot (generally) pass a pointer to memory
from one machine to another and expect to use it. It is unlikely
you will want to do this.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, you cannot (generally) pass a file
descriptor from one process to another (non-child) process via a
socket and use it straightaway. Both BSD and SVR4 provide different
ways of passing file descriptors between unrelated processes;
however, the easiest way to do this in Linux is to use the /proc
file system.</p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, you must ensure that you handle short writes
correctly. Short writes happen when the write() call only partially
writes a buffer to a file descriptor. They occur due to buffering
in the operating system and to flow control in the underlying
transport protocol. Certain system calls, termed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>slow</em></span> system calls, may be interrupted. Some
may or may not be automatically restarted, so you should explicitly
handle this when network programming. The code excerpt in
<a href="2333l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> handles short
writes.</p><p>Using multiple <span   class="emphasis"><em>threads</em></span> instead of
multiple processes may lighten the load on the server host, thereby
increasing efficiency. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Context-switching</em></span>
between threads (in the same process address space) generally has
much less associated overhead than switching between different
processes. However, since most of the slave threads in this case
are doing network I/O, they must be kernel-level threads. If they
were user-level threads, the first thread to block on I/O would
cause the whole process to block. This would result in starving all
other threads of any CPU attention until the I/O had
completed.</p><p>It is common to close unnecessary socket file descriptors in
child and parent processes when using the simple forking model.
This prevents the child or parent from potential erroneous reads or
writes and also frees up descriptors, which are a limited resource.
But do not try this when using threads. Multiple threads within a
process share the same memory space and set of file descriptors. If
you close the server socket in a slave thread, it closes for all
other threads in that process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0x12c8198"></a>Connectionless Data&mdash;UDP</h2></div></div><p><a href="2333l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> shows a
connectionless server using UDP. While UDP applications are similar
to their TCP cousins, they have some important differences.
Foremost, UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery&mdash;if you require
reliability and are using UDP, you either have to implement it
yourself in your application logic or switch to TCP.</p><p>Like TCP applications, with UDP you create a socket and bind
an address to it. (Some UDP servers do not need to call bind(), but
it does no harm and will save you from making a mistake.) UDP
servers do not listen or accept incoming connections, and clients
do not explicitly connect to servers. In fact, there is very little
difference between UDP clients and servers. The server must be
bound to a known port and address only so that the client knows
where to send messages. Additionally, the order of expected data
transmissions is reversed, i.e., when you send data using
<span   class="bold"><b>send()</b></span> in the server, your client
should expect to receive data using
<span   class="bold"><b>recv()</b></span>.</p><p>It is common for UDP clients to fill in the sockaddr_in
structure with a sin_port value of 0. (Note that 0 in either
byte-order is 0.) The system then automatically assigns an unused
port number (between 1024 and 5000) to the client. I'm leaving it
as an exercise to the reader to convert the server in Listing 4
into a UDP client.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0x12c8458"></a>/etc/services</h2></div></div><p>In order to connect to a server, you must first know both the
address and port number on which it is listening. Many common
services (FTP, TELNET, etc.) are listed in a text database file
called /etc/services. An interface exists to request a service by
name and to receive the port number (correctly formatted in network
byte-order) for that service. The function is
<span   class="bold"><b>getservbyname()</b></span>, and its prototype
is in the header file /usr/include/netdb.h. This example takes a
service name and protocol type and returns a pointer to
<span   class="bold"><b>struct servent</b></span>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct servent
{
        char *s_name;   /* official service name */
        char **s_aliases;       /* alias list */
        int s_port;     /* port number, network&lt;\n&gt;
                         * byte-order--so do not
                         * use host-to-network macros */
        char *s_proto;  /* protocol to use */
