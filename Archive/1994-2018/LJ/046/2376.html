    An introduction the freely available database suite called
    Qddb.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever needed a program to manage
some data? Perhaps you have tried one of the many relational
database products that require a significant amount of effort to
set up a few simple tables and wondered why there isn't one that is
easy to use.
</p><p>When looking at the design of the available database
products, notice that most of the tools are very cumbersome. You
must carefully define your fields, select those that require a
separate table, define link fields between the tables, choose the
important fields for searching, then finally build some sort of
interface. In many cases, people decide to use flat files because a
real database is too time consuming. There are many tasks that can
benefit greatly from a program that makes it easy to design simple
databases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117b88"></a>What is Qddb?</h2></div></div><p>Qddb is a multi-user database suite that allows you to
quickly design custom databases. If you know the data your database
should contain, you can design your database and be up and running
almost as fast as you can type the field names. Skeptical? Let's
work through an example.</p><p>There are two basic steps to building a Qddb database. First,
you must create a blank database with Qddb's
<span   class="bold"><b>qnewdb()</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash$ qnewdb Properties
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>qnewdb()</b></span> builds a new
database directory (named Properties in this case) and populates it
with several files for Qddb's use. Next, you must edit the file
Properties/Schema and define the format of the individual records:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# This is a comment
# Qddb Schema file for a landlord's property
# database
 Street City State ZipCode
 Apartments (
 AptNumber type integer
 Rented defaultvalue "N"
 Lease (
 Begin type date # start date of lease
 End type date  # end date of lease
 )
 Person (
 First Middle Last ID
 PrimaryRenter defaultvalue "Y"
 )*
 Comments*
 )*
</pre>


The first thing you notice about the Schema file is its free-style
format. Each word (other than the keywords <b  >type</b>
and <b  >defaultvalue</b> followed by a data type or
string) defines a field in a record. By default, each field's value
in a record may contain an arbitrary-length string. You can also
explicitly assign data types of <b  >string</b>,
<b  >real</b>, <b  >integer</b> and
<b  >date</b> to each field.
</p><p>Some fields are <span   class="emphasis"><em>structured</em></span>, that is,
they contain other fields. For example, Apartments contains the
subfields AptNumber, Rented, Lease, Person and Comments.
Apartments.Lease and Apartments.Person are also structured and
contain subfields.</p><p>Some fields are <span   class="emphasis"><em>expandable</em></span>, meaning each
record in the database can contain multiple values for that field.
Expandable fields are denoted by an asterisk (*) at the end of its
definition.</p><p>The sample Schema above defines a database that contains one
record for each property owned by a landlord. Each property
contains multiple apartments. Each apartment has a number, whether
it is rented, lease dates, a list of people living there and a list
of comments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1118268"></a><span   class="bold"><b>nxqddb()</b></span>--Qddb's
Generic Database Browser</h2></div></div><p>Now, you are ready to use your Properties database with
Qddb's generic X-based application
<span   class="bold"><b>nxqddb</b></span>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nxqddb Properties
</pre><p><a href="2376f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Standard nxqddb Screen</b></span></a>
</p><p>Figure 1 shows the standard nxqddb screen for the Properties
database. Once started, nxqddb() allows you to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Add new records</p></li><li><p>Search for records and view the results</p></li><li><p>Modify records</p></li><li><p>Delete records</p></li><li><p>Generate letters, postcards, e-mail, reports,
barcharts and graphs</p></li></ul></div><p>To add records, select the Modes menu button and choose Add
Mode. Once in Add Mode, you can simply fill in the fields. If you
want to add multiple values for an expandable field, you click the
mouse on the Add button next to the field's label. You can also
view all the values in an expandable field by clicking the View
button. When you are ready to save a record, select the File menu
button and choose Save. Now you are ready to add another record.
Note that Qddb does not clear the entry boxes for the next record
by default; you can choose <span   class="emphasis"><em>auto-clear</em></span> under
the configuration menu if that is the behavior you want.</p><p>Once you have added some records, you can go to Search Mode
and perform simple, fast database queries. For example, let's say
you want to find all the people renting apartments whose first name
is Sally. Just type &ldquo;sally&rdquo; in the Apartments.Person.First entry
box and press <b  >return</b>. If you want to confine
your search further, to the last name &ldquo;Jones&rdquo;, type &ldquo;jones&rdquo; in
the Apartments.Person.Last field and press
<b  >return</b>. A list of all the properties matching
the criteria will appear in a Search Results window as shown in
Figure 2. If you want to edit one of the records, click the mouse
on the entry and you will be switched to Change Mode for that
record.</p><p><a href="2376f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Search Results Window</b></span></a></p><p>You will quickly find that Qddb, by default, splits field
values into searchable components. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>separator</em></span>
is a character that separates the searchable components in a field.
You can specify your own set of separators for any field in the
schema:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MyField separators ",.;"
</pre><p>The separators schema option above tells Qddb to index the
field MyField using only the separators &ldquo;,&rdquo; (comma),
&ldquo;.&rdquo;(period) and &ldquo;;&rdquo; (semicolon). The default list of separators
includes all ASCII non-alphanumeric characters. (Note that only
fields of type <b  >string</b> use separators.)
</p><p>Qddb's simple search mechanism supports ranges, regular
expressions, numbers and dates. A fully functional expert search
and report generator round out the searching facilities of
Qddb.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x15110c0"></a>How to Configure the Search Results</h2></div></div><p>Now, that you know how to perform simple searches, you may
want to add or omit certain fields from your results. By default,
nxqddb displays only the first five fields in the search results
window.</p><p>If you click the Configure menu button, you will notice many
configuration options. This is the current state of all your nxqddb
settings. The search results configuration (see Figure 3)
determines what fields are present in the search results, how those
fields are displayed, and in what order. You can also add
user-defined columns to the search results.</p><p><a href="2376f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Search Results Configuration Window</b></span></a></p><p>After configuring the search results, you may choose to save
the configuration. <span   class="bold"><b>nxqddb</b></span>
recognizes two configurations on startup: the global configuration
and the personal configuration. The global configuration is the
default for any user of a particular database. The personal
configuration overrides any global settings for an individual
user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x15113d8"></a>Expert Search</h2></div></div><p>While the simple search mechanism is extremely handy for
quick lookups, it cannot perform all types of searches. The expert
search is designed to handle generic searches and includes the
ability to save the search criteria for later use. Figure 4 shows
the expert search window. From this window, you can combine and
nest queries in any way you like. Ranges use two entry boxes; other
search types use only the leftmost entry.</p><p><a href="2376f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Expert Search Window</b></span></a></p><p>Suppose you want to find all the primary renters whose lease
expires this month. The idea is to provide a list of the search
criteria to the expert search engine. Our search then should be all
Apartments.Person.PrimaryRenter == &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and Apartments.Lease.End
== &ldquo;@firstofmonth(this month)-@lastofmonth(this month)&rdquo;.</p><p>The expert search window always contains at least one field
for search criteria. To restrict our search to the particular
fields specified above, we click the down arrow next to the entry
box, choose Apartments.Person.PrimaryRenter as the attribute name
and dismiss the pull-down menu, then type <b  >Y</b> in
the entry. Now we have to specify a second criterion, so we:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Click the Append Node button to add a new
entry.</p></li><li><p>Click the down arrow to select a date range search
on the Apartments.Lease.End attribute.</p></li><li><p>Dismiss the menu.</p></li><li><p>Type <b  >@firstofmonth(this month)</b>
in the left entry and <b  >@lastofmonth(this month)</b>
in the right entry.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, we can click the Search button, and we will see a search
results window that contains all the matching rows using the
current search results format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1511b10"></a>Generating Reports</h2></div></div><p>Ad-hoc reports can be easily produced by executing these two
steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Configuring the search results.</p></li><li><p>Performing a simple or expert search.</p></li></ol></div><p>More detailed reports require the Qddb report generator. The
Qddb report generator can produce postcards, letters, e-mail,
summaries of numeric fields, graphs, bar charts and tables. The
basic idea is the same as producing an ad-hoc report, but you
generally want to save the settings for both the search criteria
and results format for later use.</p><p><a href="2376f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Report Generator's Window</b></span></a></p><p>Figure 5 shows the report generator's main window. From this
window you can define multiple expert searches and a search results
configuration. After defining what you want to see and how you want
to see it, you can choose any combination of the six output
formats.</p><p>For example, suppose we want to send a postcard to each
renter whose lease expires this month. First, we need to configure
the format of our return and destination addresses. Choose the
Report Format Defaults option under the Configure menu button. You
will notice two options in the cascaded menu: Return Address and
Destination Address. Choose Return Address and fill in the return
address as you want it to appear on postcards and letters. Next,
choose Destination Address. This option will format arbitrary
fields for the destination address on all postcards and letters.
Once you have configured the addresses, you may wish to save your
configuration so these options become the default.</p><p>We have already seen how to perform the expert search, so
let's just use the previous example for defining what you want to
see in your report. Next, we have to define the relevant fields for
the report via the Results Format button. To generate a postcard,
we must include all address information, plus we probably want to
include the lease's expiration date for inclusion in the message.
Now, we can choose the type of reports we wish to generate. If you
want a listing as well as postcards, you can choose both options
and click the Run Report button. Since we chose listing as well as
postcards, the listing appears first and can be printed out. After
printing the listing, we are prompted for the postcard message as
shown in Figure 6. Notice that the postcard message is personalized
for the recipient by using data from each record.</p><p><a href="2376f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Postcard Window</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1512140"></a>Qddb and the Relational Model</h2></div></div><p>In the simple case, Qddb uses a single set of <span   class="emphasis"><em>tuple
trees</em></span> instead of flat tables. A tuple tree is simply the
collection of prejoined rows from the relational tables in a
one-many relationship. That is, each record represents some entity,
and each entity can have an arbitrary number of values for some
subset of the fields. More complex cases (such as many-many
relationships) can be handled with a set of Qddb schemas.</p><p>We can use standard relational tables to model any Qddb
schema. For example, our Properties schema requires four tables:
one table for the address information and one table for each
expandable field. The tables require a plethora of link information
for the purpose of joining the rows.</p><p>It is the complexity of managing these tables that prevents
normal users from building their own databases with standard
relational tools. Even programmers avoid fields that can have
multiple values because a separate table is required for each such
field. With Qddb, users and programmers can allow multiple values
for any field by simply appending an asterisk to the field's
definition in the schema.</p><p>The relational model requires that field values be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>atomic</em></span>. That is, when searching, field values
cannot be broken into smaller searchable components. By default,
Qddb disobeys this rule by breaking field values of type
<b  >string</b> at the separators. Most users do not care
about the relational model, they simply want to do their work.
Sometimes this work involves searching the database for a
particular record. By relaxing this restriction, Qddb can search
for words in textual fields such as comments or abstracts. For
string fields where atomicity is important, you can specify an
empty list of separators for that particular field.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1512458"></a>Storage Format and Indexing</h2></div></div><p>Qddb uses several interesting storage techniques. If you look
at the contents of the files in your database directory, you will
see that all Qddb data and index files are stored as readable text.
The Database file contains the field values for each record in the
stable part of the database. Empty fields require no storage and
are omitted from the Database file.</p><p>If you browse the Database file, you will also notice that
each record is stored contiguously. Qddb's records are prejoined
rows from the relational tables defined in the schema. When you
perform a search, the matching tuple trees in the Database file are
expanded into the equivalent relational rows for viewing
purposes.</p><p>Qddb uses inverted indices for searching. When you perform a
search, the criteria are quickly translated into the file offsets
for the corresponding tuple trees. Each matching tuple tree can
then be read from the disk with one disk read per tuple
tree.</p><p>Since Qddb currently uses inverted indices for indexing, you
should periodically reindex the database so Qddb can retain its
speed. Only changes and additions are stored in a secondary
location and can be reindexed on the fly. The
<span   class="bold"><b>qstall</b></span> command is used for this
purpose:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
qstall Properties
</pre><p>After stabilization, all changes, additions, and deletions
are committed to the Database file.
