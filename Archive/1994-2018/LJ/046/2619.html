  where can I find out about it? &mdash;Greg Bell</p><p>It is possible to use multiple monitors but to do so you will
need an X Server that supports it. Accelerated X from Xi Graphics
and Metro-X from Metro Link both support this feature (known as
multi-headed). Based on comments from friends I would go with
Accelerated-X for performance and stability reasons. To find more
information, visit their web sites :Xi Graphics:

login). It accepts the connections but no user name is good enough
for it. It worked fine until I moved my /usr directories onto their
own file system. The next day, people said they couldn't log into
my FTP server. &mdash;Anonymous</p><p>From your description, I can't tell what the problem is for
certain, but I suspect it is incorrect /etc/passwd entries. To
debug this problem, run <span   class="bold"><b>strace</b></span> on
the process generating the error, in this case
<span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span>. You'll find which operation
causes the connection refusal by attaching strace to the process
before the error occurs, that is, before typing your user
name. &mdash;Alessandro Rubini alessandro.rubini@pluto.linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b4580.0x11ac450"></a>Corrupted Terminal</h2></div></div><p>When I <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> a binary file
(<b  >cat xxxx.tgz</b>) to a virtual console (for example
tty1) all of the characters are changed on the screen. For example
the &ldquo;a&rdquo; character become a big rectangle. I can continue to type
commands but when I use the mouse to cut and paste in another tty
the words are stripped of their vowels. How can I solve this
problem without a reboot? &mdash;Thierry Neusius Slackware 3.2</p><p>The cat program was designed to handle ASCII files. When used
on a binary file, it attempts to display it just like any ASCII
file. Unfortunately, this usually results in the terminal getting
corrupted because cat interprets a lot of the binary file as
control sequences. These control sequences almost always result in
a lot of unprintable characters and a messed up terminal. Logging
out usually solves the problem of a corrupted terminal. &mdash;Keith
Stevenson ktstev01@homer.louisville.edu</p><p>You can run the program
<span   class="bold"><b>reset</b></span> to switch back to normal

there is any efficient way to cluster two or more Linux servers. I
want it so that if one server goes down, all the hits will just go
to the active server. I have experimented with round-robin DNS, but
that doesn't give me the fault tolerance I want. I'd welcome any
suggestions.  &mdash;Tim ArcherRed Hat 4.1</p><p>You can use IP aliasing to solve this problem. Each machine
should run a script that watches the status of the other. When a
machine stops responding, the working machine adds an IP alias for
the down machine's IP number. Now the up machine answers for both
itself and the down machine. When the original machine comes back
on-line, the alias is removed.</p><p>What makes this tricky is that you must make sure that you
never have both machines responding to the same IP address at the
same time. You can do this in several ways. One way is to have a
separate communication path between the two machines. Here, again,
you can use IP aliasing. First, assign each machine a primary,
unique IP number. No other machine will ever use that number. Next,
assign an IP alias to each machine to handle the Web traffic. Your
round-robin DNS cycles through the aliases, not the primary machine
addresses.</p><p>Now, the two machines can always talk to each other using the
primary addresses regardless of who is responding to the IP
aliases. The machines monitor each other on the primary addresses
and install or remove the aliases depending on each other's
state.</p><p>You may lose a few hits during the time it takes the first
machine to figure out that the other is down and switch over, but
most people generally find the number of missed hits
acceptable. &mdash;Larry Augustin, VA Research lma@varesearch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b4580.0x11aca28"></a>Playing Internet Games Through A
Firewall</h2></div></div><p>With the release of more Internet-capable games like Diablo,
Netstorm and Quake, what needs to be done so that the IP packets
are routed through a firewall?
</p><p>We use a Linux firewall to connect to our Internet service
provider via PPP with dynamic IP numbers. The other members of the
household would like to connect to the various servers available
for games. I've looked though the documentation and nothing seems
to work. I've tried to add services to the /etc/services file,
(following up in /etc/inetd.conf, /etc/hosts.allow, /etc/sockd.conf
and a few others). Our firewall works by setting firewall on in the
kernel and IP forwarding turned off. &mdash;Aaron Hicks Slackware
2.0</p><p>You need to allow the packets to be forwarded for Internet
hosts to see machines on your local LAN. To keep the firewall
protection active in your arrangement, find out the port numbers
the various games use.</p><p>Suppose you wanted to allow only TELNET connections through
your firewall. TELNET uses port 23. Using
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> you can specify forwarding
rules to allow packets destined for port 23 to pass through your
firewall. For additional protection, you can specify entries only
for those machines that should receive these packets.</p><p>Read the ipfwadm(8) man page for more information on
command-line syntax for this tool. Note that this applies only to
standard Linux firewalling systems (using the kernel facilities,
rather than external programs). In this case, the kernel handles
all firewall functions, and ipfwadm is only used to configure the
rules. &mdash;Larry Augustin, VA Research lma@varesearch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b4580.0x11acce8"></a>Compatibility Between Linux
Distributions</h2></div></div><p>I have been feeling a bit confused lately about the different
Linux distributions. Specifically, if they are compatible with one
another. The two distributions I use are Slackware and Red Hat. I
prefer the way Slackware handles some things and prefer the Red Hat
method for certain other things. What I would like to know is if
these two distributions (as well as the others) are interchangeable
in any way. For example, would it be possible to install
<span   class="bold"><b>pkgtool</b></span> on a Red Hat system and
could an XF86_SVGA server from Red Hat work on a Slackware
distribution? Could a Slackware kernel be used to boot a Red Hat
system? &mdash;Steven M. St. Hilaire</p><p>The core of this question centers around Linux itself. As far
as binary compatibility goes, that depends on your platform, not
your distribution. If you use x86 binaries from all distributions,
then yes, they are indeed compatible.</p><p>The problems you are likely to run into are conflicts in
directory locations and library versions, which can happen in any
binary distribution. The kernels from the various distributions
will boot properly, but once Linux boots, it needs to perform some
work to get the entire system mounted and operating.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Take two examples from your question. The XF86_SVGA
server would most likely operate properly, if you had installed the
entire Xfree86 installation from the Slackware set. If, on the
other hand, you wanted to use</em></span> only the X server from the
Slackware distribution and use the Red Hat distribution to install
the rest of the X system, you would likely run into trouble.</p><p>The second example is the Red Hat control panel. Yes, it
would have difficulty with those items which you installed from
Slackware. But you would not have trouble using it to control
packages which you installed from the Red Hat distribution.</p><p>If you do this, be aware that you could be in for long nights
working out the various incompatibilities. Certain things may work
without trouble, especially third-party packages (such as some
database systems) that come in specific formats for your
convenience. Unless you are an experienced administrator, I would
not recommend installing system-level facilities using a mixed
distribution.</p><p>Instead, why not select one distribution and install the
remaining items by compiling the source distribution? It will
probably take somewhat less time to do because of the headaches you
will avoid, and you will gain a much stronger understanding of how
the various programs, system libraries and kernel facilities
interact. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technologies chadr@brt.com</p></div></div>
