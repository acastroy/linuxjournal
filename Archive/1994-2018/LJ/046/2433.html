    A high school student tells us about using Linux as a server
    at school, at home and at work.

talked about how you can use Linux in your business. Well, I'll
tell you about how Linux helped me. But first of all, you have to
know that I'm 16 years old and attending high school. I live in
Geneva, Switzerland.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f6b580.0x2063500"></a>Linux at School</h2></div></div><p>At my school, officials decided to hook up to the Internet
with a single 64K ISDN line. At first this may sound fast but for
50 computers, it's not. We found that when a class wanted to find
some information on the Internet, it was usually stored on one
server. As a result we decided to create an Intranet web server on
which we would store the desired site, and everybody could access
it from there. That would solve the speed problem. Since our
resources were limited, I proposed that we install Linux on the
machine as our operating system, and I did the install. It turned
out to be a great solution in addition to being very
cost-effective. I then installed Squid, a cache program, to make
the connection even faster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f6b580.0x2063608"></a>Linux At Home</h2></div></div><p>At home, I have three computers, all networked, but only one
modem to connect to my ISP. I used to use Wingate for Windows 95,
but it wasn't the best solution. Someone told me about a feature
called IP masquerading in Linux. With only one account, the three
computers can now access the Internet. All of this software is
free, of course.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f6b580.0x2063710"></a>Linux At Work</h2></div></div><p>A company would probably not use Linux in the same way I do.
Lately, there has been a lot of talk about Intranets; however, for
a small company an Intranet might cost too much. Server software is
quite expensive. If you want messaging capabilities with industry
standard protocols, you have a choice of two solutions: commercial
software for big bucks, or free software on Linux. Linux comes with
sendmail, an SMTP mail server. You can access the server with a
POP3 mail program, such as Netscape, Internet Explorer, Eudora,
etc. Note that the client computers do not need to run Linux. They
can be Macintoshes, or PCs running Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. The
most basic use of a server is usually a file server. You can access
the server via FTP, but doing so is not very user friendly. Another
alternative is to use Microsoft's SMB protocol, or on a Linux
server, you can install Samba (also free). SAMBA will allow all
Windows for Workgroups and Windows 95 machines to access the file
server. Files can the be stored and retrieved as if they were
local.</p><p>Of course, to follow the Internet trend, you can install
Apache (http://www.apache.org/). Apache is an easy to install, easy
to use web server. It will allow you to present the most basic
pages, and you'll also be able to put up some Java applets. Many
companies use Java applets to access databases. Solid Technology
supports a SQL server for Linux, and there are many free Linux
databases, as seen in other articles in this issue.</p><p>If you decided to make an installation as I have described on
Windows NT, you would have to pay at least 1000 Swiss francs. With
Linux, apart from the cost of the computer, the same installation
is nearly free. If you choose to buy a CD-ROM with a complete Linux
distribution, it'll cost you about 25 Swiss francs. You make the
choice.</p></div></div>
