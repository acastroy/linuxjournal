    Learn all about Apache modules and mSQL programming using a
    web counting program as an example.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x201d580.0x2115500"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is not about web counters.
Oh, I know what the title says, and I am going to be showing you
how to use mSQL to make a fast and effective counter. But that is
just icing on the cake. The real purpose of this article is to
explore the fascinating worlds of Apache modules and mSQL
programming.
</p><p>Of course, counters are far from the newest thing to hit the
streets. I'd be willing to bet that you have one on your home page.
However, the vast majority of counters that people use are third
party off-site counters. These counters are usually implemented by
including an &lt;IMG&gt; tag on your page to call a remote site
which keeps track of the number of accesses and returns a counter
image containing the current count. The problems with this method
are well known: it can be expensive, it doesn't include all of your
hits (especially hits from text-based browsers), and it isn't
customizable.</p><p>Being Linux users, we don't settle for the easy way of doing
things&mdash;we do them the right way. Every major distribution of Linux
comes with the Apache web server. This gives every Linux user with
a network connection the ability to run their own web site without
the constraints of using third-party sites for anything, not even
counters.</p><p>The Apache web server is far and away the most widely used
web server on the planet. One of the features that makes it so
popular (besides that fact that it is free and always will be) is
its modular design. The server can easily be enhanced by writing
modules that compile right into the main program. These modules are
usually written in C, but there are even modules which allow you to
write modules in other languages, such as Perl.</p><p>The good news is that writing an Apache module is not hard to
do. Even a novice C programmer like me was able to get the hang of
it fairly quickly. With that said, let's get down to the business
of writing a counter module for Apache.</p><p>There are several good reasons for making your web counter a
module that is a part of the server. Counters that work via CGI
(such as the ones described above) do not record all possible hits
to your page. On the other hand, counters that work by analyzing
log files are hard to keep up to date, and they can also miss some
hits (e.g., it may catch /~myhome/index.html but miss /~myhome/ or
/~myhome). A counter directly integrated into the web server,
however, is guaranteed to catch all possible hits since all files
requested from your web server must be sent through the server. In
addition, going through the web server allows you to use the name
of the file that was actually sent to the user, so that instead of
/~myhome, /~myhome/ and /~myhome/index.html, all hits are labelled
/~myhome/index.html. The other big advantages are speed and
customization. You know that the counter is going to be up to date,
since every file going through the server also goes through your
counter.</p><p>Now, all we have to do is decide how to store the data. As a
matter of fact, a friendly member of the Apache community has done
some of our work by writing an Apache module called mod_cntr.c (see
Resources) which is a counter that uses plain text files or DBM
databases to store the data.</p><p>As far as making a counter module goes, that one is really
all you need. Download the mod_cntr.c file, put it in your Apache
source directory and recompile. But being discerning Linux users,
we want more power&mdash;that power is going to come from the mSQL
database.</p><p>The mSQL engine is very fast at the expense of being an
incomplete SQL language, but it has enough for our needs. Running
our counter module through an mSQL module removes the need for
cumbersome text files. All we do is call up the nearest mSQL server
(whether on the same machine as the server or not) and send it the
instructions needed to maintain the database.</p><p>I won't go into the details on how to obtain and install mSQL
here. Complete instructions are available on the mSQL web page (See
Resources). To compile our mSQL-based counter, you need the
libmsql.a library in your libraries path and the msql.h header
somewhere accessible.</p><p>Of course, the best way to handle this would be to add mSQL
capabilities to the already existing mod_cntr.c. And in fact, this
is the way I do it for my production server. But as a simple case,
I'm going to rewrite the module so that it only supports mSQL. This
will remove a bit of clutter and be a bit more
understandable.</p><p><a href="2308l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> contains the code
for the mSQL-based counter. Let's first look at this from the
perspective of an Apache module. The Apache module API contains
very simple rules for creating modules. Lines 403-419 contain the
module definition that the web server reads to define the module.
There are many options here, but for our needs (and for the needs
of most modules), we only need to define four of them. The first
two, defined on lines 406 and 408, are
<span   class="bold"><b>create_cntr_dir_config_rec</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>create_cntr_srv_config_rec</b></span>. These
are the names of functions which initialize the variables used by
our modules. Notice that there are two of these, one containing the
characters &ldquo;dir&rdquo; and one with &ldquo;srv&rdquo;. Apache allows users to
customize most aspects of the server on a per-directory basis using
.htaccess files; this configuration is accessed with
create_cntr_dir_config_rec. The main server configuration files
(access.conf and httpd.conf) are accessed with
create_cntr_srv_config_rec.</p><p>The code for the create_cntr_dir_config_rec and
create_cntr_svr_config_rec functions are located on lines 132-146
and 148-162, respectively. The two sections of code are almost
identical. Each simply initializes the counter information,
contained in the structure
<span   class="bold"><b>cntr_config_rec</b></span> (lines 106-112),
with the defaults defined in lines 122-127. If you were writing a
module for any purpose, you should include two functions similar to
these to initialize any default variables for both the server-wide
and per-directory configurations.</p><p>The next definition for our module is
<b  >cntr_cmds</b> at line 410. This is the name of an
array of type <b  >command_rec</b> which is defined in
the Apache header files. These are the options which users of your
module can enter into the Apache configuration files. There are six
fields which must be filled out for each command_rec:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The name of the configuration option the user will
enter. For instance, the command_rec on line 240 has the name
<b  >CounterType</b>. It is general practice to preface
the name with <b  >Server</b>, if it is an option for the
server-wide configuration files.</p></li><li><p>The name of the function called to give the user's
configuration information to the module.</p></li><li><p>A null pointer used to pass additional information
to the function given previously.</p></li><li><p>A flag indicating where the configuration option
can appear. In our module, we use <b  >ACCESS_CONF</b>
which means that the option can appear in a directory section of
the server's access.conf file or in .htaccess file and
<b  >RSRC_CONF</b> which means that the option may appear
only in the global access.conf or httpd.conf.</p></li><li><p>A flag indicating how many arguments the
configuration option requires. In our module, we use
<b  >TAKE1</b> which indicates one argument (pre-parsed
by the server) and <b  >TAKE2</b> which indicates two
arguments separated by white space. Other flags, as well as full
documentation on the whole server API, can be found at
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/API.html.</p></li><li><p>A string describing the use of the configuration
option. It is displayed when the user enters the wrong number or
type of arguments for the option.</p></li></ol></div><p>Our module defines six configuration options.
<b  >CounterType</b> defining the type of database to use
(mSQL only, in this case, but I left the line in for easy
transition to the original version of this module with text and DBM
databases). <b  >CounterAutoAdd</b> allows the user to
decide whether or not a URI (the portion of the URL relative to the
host) encountered for the first time should automatically be added
to the database. <b  >CounterDB</b> is the name of the
mSQL database used, followed by the table within that database.
There are three similar options that do the same operations for the
server-wide configuration.</p><p>Each of the options defined has an associated function
(<span   class="bold"><b>set_cntr_type</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>set_cntr_autoadd</b></span>, etc.). These
functions check to see if the user supplied a value for that
option. If so, that value is added to the cntr_config_rec structure
for the module, replacing the default.</p><p>The final bit of information about our module is on line 417.
This is the name of the function which does all of the work. In our
case, that is the function
<span   class="bold"><b>cntr_update</b></span> located on lines
331-400.</p><p>That is all there is to creating an Apache module. Once you
create a C file with a module structure that has two functions to
initialize default variables, a command_rec structure with
user-definable options (along with functions to insert those
options into your module) and a function to perform the action, you
have everything you need. Of course, to do anything useful you have
to code the action into that last function, so let's take a look at
cntr_update.</p><p>The first interesting bit of this function occurs on lines
343 and 344. The structure <span   class="bold"><b>r</b></span> is of
type <b  >request_rec</b> (defined in the Apache headers)
and is passed to us from the web server. This structure has all of
the information we need about the request the server is currently
handling, including the URI of the document and whether or not the
document has been fully resolved. In lines 343-344, we skip all of
the unresolved steps the server goes through to get the final file,
so that the URI we receive is the name of the file actually sent.
This way, the URIs entered into our database are of the form
/directoryname/index.html instead of /directoryname,
/directoryname/ or whatever name the client-end user actually
typed. On lines 348-351, we abort if there is no URI (the user made
a typo or the file doesn't exist) or the file is a server-side
include (no need to keep a counter for those). We then call the
function <span   class="bold"><b>get_module_config</b></span> for
both the server-wide and per-directory cases. This is a function
provided by the web server which gathers all of the user-supplied
options and calls the appropriate functions (that we have provided)
and returns a cntr_config_rec structure with the initialized
variables.</p><p>Next, we check to make sure that the user has provided a
database and table for us to work with. Assuming everything is set,
we then call the <span   class="bold"><b>cntr_inc</b></span> function
to increment the counter for the given URI. After that we set a
couple of environment variables which can be used by CGI programs
that may be interested in the counter (e.g., an image generator
that makes an odometer graphic).</p><p>The main purpose of the cntr_inc function (lines 310-329) is
to do a bit of preprocessing of the URI and then call the
appropriate database incrementing function. In our case we only
have one type of database, so this is a very short function. First
it strips double slashes (//) from the URI and then calls the
<span   class="bold"><b>cntr_incmsql</b></span> function to do the
actual work.</p><p>As far as creating an Apache module goes, we're done. Pretty
cool, eh? I certainly never imagined that creating an extension to
a web server could be so easy. Now all we have to do is code the
cntr_incmsql function to do the work.</p><p>The cntr_incmsql function (lines 253-308) is the heart of the
module. In 55 lines we implement a fast, effective web counter
using an SQL database server. The C API provided with mSQL includes
several functions that allow easy access to all of mSQL's features.
The first one we use is on line 264. There we call
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlConnect</b></span> to connect us to the
local database server. You can also call msqlConnect with a
non-NULL argument to connect to a remote database server. In the
next two lines, we check to make sure we connected successfully and
return an error if we didn't. Line 269 calls
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlSelectDB</b></span> to select the
database supplied to us by the configuration options. Again, if the
function does not return successfully, an error is
generated.</p><p>Now that we have connected to the appropriate database, we
can send our first SQL query to find out if the given URI already
exists in the database. The table we query is given by the user and
must have a <b  >uri char</b> field which is a non-null
unique index, a <b  >cntr_count int</b> field and a
<b  >cntr_date char</b> field. The query we send
is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select cntr_count,
cntr_date from <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span> where uri='<span   class="emphasis"><em>uriname</em></span>'
</pre><p>This query returns the existing count of the URI (if any) and
the last time it was reset. We send this query using the
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlQuery</b></span> function and check for
errors as usual. The next step is to retrieve the results (if any)
from the server. We do this with the
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlStoreResult</b></span> function. This
function returns a structure which allows us to retrieve the
results row by row, along with other information about the results
such as the number of rows retrieved. In line 281 we use the
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlNumRows</b></span> function to see how
many rows were retried. The number should be one or zero since each
URI is unique. (A full list of the SQL queries supported by mSQL
can be found on the mSQL home page listed in Resources.)
</p><p>If there already exists an entry for that URI, we enter the
block on lines 282-293. First we use the
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlFetchRow</b></span> function to retrieve
the number of counts for the URI. Since we know we only have one
row of data, we only need to call the function once. If you were
expecting multiple rows of data, you can keep calling msqlFetchRow
to retrieve them until the data runs out. The msqlFetchRow function
returns an array which contains each field that you requested. In
this case, we asked for the count and the date for the URI. We then
increment the count and place the count and date into our results
structure so that CGIs or other interested programs can access
them. Finally, we send the update query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
update
</pre><p>(with the appropriate count and uri in place). After checking
for errors, we are free to close the database (using
<span   class="bold"><b>msqlClose</b></span>) and deallocate any
database memory using
(<span   class="bold"><b>msqlFreeResult</b></span>). We can then
return success and everyone is happy.
</p><p>If the URI we have does not exist in the database, we have to
enter it. First we check to see if anyone has defined the
<span   class="bold"><b>CounterAutoAdd</b></span> option in the
server's configuration files. If they have, then we just skip this
URI and go home. If CounterAutoAdd is not defined, we have to add
the URI into the database with a count of 1 and the current date.
The current date is set using the server-defined function
<span   class="bold"><b>ht_time</b></span> which returns a
pre-formatted string. We do this with the following query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
insert into
cntr_date) values ( '<span   class="emphasis"><em>myuri</em></span>', 1, '<span   class="emphasis"><em>currenttime</em></span>' )
</pre><p>(with appropriate values for <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>myuri</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>currenttime</em></span>).
Then we always check for errors. If there are no errors, the module
is finished. We now have a working hit counter built right into the
web server.
</p><p>This module is neat, but it is not perfect. A problem known
as a race condition arises if you are running a high volume server.
Note that on line 275, we check the database to see if the URI
already exists. If it doesn't, then on line 296 we insert the URI
into the database. Suppose that somewhere between line 275 and 296,
another hit comes in for the same URI. The database indicates on
return that the URI does not exist; it doesn't know the first hit
is about to add it to the database. By the time the second hit
reaches line 296, the URI has now been entered into the database by
the first, and the database returns an error due to a non-unique
URI.</p><p>In a fully-featured SQL server, this problem is solved by a
technique called &ldquo;transactions&rdquo; where multiple commands can be
entered into the database together&mdash;before any other commands are
processed. Hopefully, mSQL will support transactions in the near
future. Until then, one workaround for this problem is to
initialize your database with all of the URIs for your site and a
count of 0. This way, the counter will never be told that a URI
doesn't exist.</p><p><a href="2308s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
