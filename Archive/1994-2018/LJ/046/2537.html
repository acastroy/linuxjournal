    Instead of approximately 30 keystrokes to do my transaction
    (deposit three
    checks with cash back), I saw as many keystrokes interspersed with
    about half a dozen mouse operations.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2332580.0x242a138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last weekend my credit union (I won't
mention their name in order to avoid embarrassing them) did a
computer conversion. Conversion is their word&mdash;they didn't say
upgrade. They replaced their aging Data General system with a
Windows 95 system. You can guess the kind&mdash;big video displays,
stereo speakers on the display, keyboard in a drawer and, amazing
as it seems, a mouse.
</p><p>This isn't a little credit union&mdash;they have multiple offices,
their own set of ATMs and, at my local branch, six teller windows.
What was the first thing that made the conversion obvious? It was
the long line&mdash;not something I expected, because it's usually not
there. I talked to a teller, who thought the line was her fault
because she wasn't used to the new system. She was wrong.</p><p>I watched as she did my transaction, as I have watched
tellers at this credit union for over 10 years. (I even witnessed
the conversion to the Data General system.) What I saw this time
was a new way of doing transaction processing. Instead of
approximately 30 keystrokes to do my transaction (deposit three
checks with cash back), I saw as many keystrokes interspersed with
about half a dozen mouse operations.</p><p>I told her it was impossible to do the job quickly when a
mouse is involved, pointing out how easily a selection mistake can
be made. I even told her I had been thinking about applications
such as a credit union transaction-processing system and how an
operating system called Linux was a better platform for building
such a system. She asked me to let her know when I had this new
system available for use.</p><p>Now, I'm doing my job as a Linux evangelist, and
<i  >Linux Journal</i> is doing its job to show people
that some businesses have found the right use for Linux. What's
missing is someone to get all the necessary applications
together.</p><p>I expect it is possible to write a well designed
transaction-processing system on MS Windows, but it certainly would
leave out all of that wonderful drag-and-drop stuff. In a past life
as a systems design specialist, I was the guy who had to evaluate
the user's requirements and come up with the proper solution.
Asking a bank teller to use a mouse when a typical transaction
involves entering an account number, some check numbers and some
dollar amounts (and nothing else) does not make sense. Doing so
means you must build a system which includes the overhead of a
mouse-oriented graphical operating system&mdash;overhead that is just
not necessary in this case.</p><p>If this same system was built with Linux, the hardware and
software costs would be reduced, as well as the programming effort.
And, bottom line&mdash;we would have Linux out there solving yet another
problem.</p><p>If any of this strikes home, you should take a look at the
discussion groups on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web
page (http://www.linuxjournal.com/). We put them there to encourage
the community to get talking and get programming on the
applications that will make Linux the best solution for a variety
of problems. Oh, and if you already have a Linux-based credit union
package, let me know&mdash;there's this credit union in Seattle that
could use your help.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2332580.0x242a558"></a>Changes at <i  >Linux Journal</i></h2></div></div><p>On a totally different subject, there have been some changes
at <i  >LJ</i>. Margie told you about the subscription
outsourcing fiasco last month. With subscription processing
returned to our office and Linux systems, Ellen Dahl has returned
to handle your subscriptions (info@linuxjournal.com).</p><p>Another change is that Jennifer Davies has joined the
<i  >LJ</i> staff as my assistant. We expect the
combination of her Masters in Library Science and her winning
personality will make her the right addition to the team.</p><p>Finally, almost four years ago, Lydia Kinata applied for a
job with us doing layout. We didn't have an opening in layout at
that time, so Lydia was hired on in Order Processing and since then
has done almost every other job available in the company, including
customer service, products development, A/R, A/P, payroll and
office management. She has handled all of these jobs efficiently
and well. A current opening in layout will give her the opportunity
to work in her area of expertise. Beginning with the March issue,
Lydia will be our new Layout Artist.</p></div></div>
