    Portions of your web site can be kept secure using user name,
    password
    combinations.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x135e500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the wonderful things about the Web
is that so much information is freely available. For the cost of a
telephone call and a monthly bill from your Internet service
provider, you can read hundreds of newspapers, get updates on the
computer industry and listen to radio stations from your home town.
</p><p>Even the most open, freely available site usually contains
one or more sections that are not meant for public consumption. The
reasons for cordoning off sections of the site can vary: Perhaps
the webmaster wants a place to put his favorite hacks, a repository
for testing new programs or a directory in which staff notices can
be placed. If a site wants to charge for content or restrict access
to members of an organization, the problem becomes even more
obvious.</p><p>One popular way to handle these problems is to create a
directory that others are unlikely to guess. But this approach,
known as &ldquo;security through obscurity&rdquo;, only works as long as no
one leaks the name of the hidden directory. A far more robust
approach will restrict access based on user name,password
combinations.</p><p>This month, we will look at ways in which to restrict access
to your server with the Web's standard user name, password
authorization scheme. The principles should apply to any web
server, but I will be using the freely available Apache web server
(available at http://www.apache.org/) in my examples.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x135e710"></a>How Access Restrictions Work</h2></div></div><p>Access restrictions are part of HTTP, the protocol used in
most web transactions. When your browser requests a document from a
server using HTTP, it is usually returned immediately, preceded by
several headers (i.e., name,value pairs) describing its length, the
date on which it was last modified and the type of content it
contains.</p><p>HTTP's designers recognized that webmasters might want to
restrict access to one or more directories. Since version 1.0, HTTP
has included provisions for restricting access to parts of a web
site.</p><p>Let's see how this protection works from a computer's view,
first by looking at an unprotected site and then by looking at a
protected one. Once we understand how access protection works, we
can incorporate it into our own work.</p><p>Everything starts when a user asks the browser to retrieve a
document. No matter whether the user types the URL into a text
field, selects it from a list of book marks or clicks on a
hyperlink in an existing page of HTML, the effect is the same. The
browser takes the URL, dissects it into a protocol, a server and a
document, and takes the appropriate action. In the case of a URL
such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.ssc.com/lj/
</pre><p>the protocol name is http, the server name is www.ssc.com,
and the document name (really a directory) is /lj/. Most Web
servers are configured such that requesting a directory is the same
as requesting the file index.html within that directory, so the
above URL is effectively equivalent to this one:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.ssc.com/lj/index.html
</pre>


We can simulate the browser's actions by dissecting the URL on our
own and by requesting the document /lj/ from www.ssc.com using HTTP
from the Linux command line. The TELNET program is generally used
to log into a remote machine, most often to open a shell on that
machine. By giving <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> an
argument in addition to the machine name, we can specify the port
to which we wish to connect. Since web servers sit on port 80 by
default, we can connect to the web server on www.ssc.com by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet www.ssc.com 80
</pre>


When we establish a connection to that web server, we can enter an
HTTP request. These requests start with a line describing the
action we wish to take (known as a &ldquo;method&rdquo;), the name of the
document we wish to retrieve and the version of HTTP we are using.
Beginning with HTTP 1.0, this initial line can be followed by one
or more header lines containing information about the user's
browser, document types that the browser is willing to expect, HTTP
cookies that may have been set in the past and other useful bits of
information. For our purposes, it is enough to enter this line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /lj/ HTTP/1.0
</pre>


and then press <b  >enter</b> twice&mdash;once to end the line
containing the request, and a second time to indicate that we have
finished sending all of the headers and that we will now wait for a
response from the server.
</p><p>If all goes well, the server will respond by returning a page
of HTML. In this particular case, we will receive HTML-formatted
text (as we can tell from the text/html Content-Type header at the
top of the response) with the latest information about this very
magazine. Your browser is responsible for taking the HTML returned
by the server and displaying it for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x135ebe0"></a>Retrieving a Protected Document</h2></div></div><p>If we try to retrieve a protected document, things get a bit
more complicated. (We will see how to protect documents in just a
moment; for now, assume that it is possible to restrict access to
documents on a web server.) My main workstation, running Red Hat
Linux 4.2 and Apache 1.2.4, contains a &ldquo;private&rdquo; directory whose
contents are restricted. Let's retrieve the contents of /private/,
just as I requested the contents of /lj/ before.</p><p>From the shell prompt, I connect to the web server with the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet localhost 80
</pre><p>Once I am connected, I request the &ldquo;private&rdquo; directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /private/ HTTP/1.0
</pre>


Instead of receiving the contents of the /private directory or the
index.html file contained within /private, I get the following
response:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Date: Mon, 26 Jan 1998 12:08:17 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.4
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="TestRealmName"
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;401 Authorization Required&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Authorization Required&lt;/H1&gt;
This server could not verify that you
are authorized to access the document you
requested. Either you supplied the wrong
credentials (e.g., bad password), or your
browser doesn't understand how to supply
the credentials required.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>


In other words, my request was rejected because I had not
authenticated myself. When did it give me a chance to do so?
</p><p>Herein lies the dirty little secret of user authentication:
when you retrieve a protected document, your browser really has to
request the document <span   class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span>. The first time
that it tries to retrieve the document, a browser receives a
message similar to the one that we received above, marked with the
response code 401 indicating that you need authorization in order
to retrieve this document.</p><p>Old or broken browsers stop at that point, presenting the
server's error message to the user. Modern browsers that understand
authentication present the user with a dialog box into which the
user can type a user name and password. The browser then takes the
user name and password, puts both into Base64 format and sends that
along in an &ldquo;Authorization&rdquo; header after the initial
request.</p><p>Modern browsers also save time by keeping track of user names
and passwords that you have already entered. Thus, the first time
you encounter a protected directory, you are prompted for your user
name and password. The second time you retrieve a file from the
same directory, you will not be prompted.
Whether the browser waits to receive the
<span   class="bold"><b>401 -- Authorization Required</b></span>
error before sending the user name, password
pair or it automatically responds to the message depends on the
implementation.</p><p>Thus, if my user name is &ldquo;reuven&rdquo; and my password is
&ldquo;password&rdquo;, I can retrieve the contents of the /private/
directory by using TELNET to access port 80 on my local computer
and entering:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GET /private/ HTTP/1.0
Authorization: Basic cmV1dmVuOnJldXZlbg==
</pre><p>The first line is identical to what we have seen before; it
indicates that we want to use HTTP 1.0 to retrieve the document
named /private/ (which happens to be a directory, although the
client does not know that) using the GET method. Rather than
pressing <b  >enter</b> twice after the first line, we
only press it once and then add a single additional header. This
one begins with &ldquo;Authorization:&rdquo;, meaning that we are about to
send authorization information to the system using the &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;
algorithm, which is nothing more than a Base64 encoding of the user
name and password that the user entered in the form
<b  >username:password</b>.
</p><p>If the user name, password combination succeeds, the system
returns the contents of the resource requested by the browser. If
the request fails, the same message (with response code 401) is
returned to the user's browser. The browser can allow the user to
try again or can display the error message sent along with the 401
message.</p><p>In this case, the user name, password combination does indeed
work, giving me the contents of /private/, which is the file
/private/index.html, returned in the following manner:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>The 200 status code at the top of the response indicates that
everything has gone well and that the server was able to retrieve
the document that we requested. As you can see from the
Content-Type header (or simply by looking at the document's
contents), the requested document contains HTML-formatted text.
Were we to view this through our browser, we would undoubtedly see
the text in different sizes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x135f370"></a>Is This Real Security?</h2></div></div><p>If you are wondering how I managed to get the Base64
equivalent of my user name, password combination, it was with the
help of the following one-line Perl program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -e 'use MIME::Base64;\
  print encode_base64("reuven:password");'
</pre><p>Entering the above in the shell results in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cmV1dmVuOnBhc3N3b3Jk
</pre>


which must have been the Base64 equivalent of
<b  >reuven:password</b>, because it allowed us access to
the resource.
</p><p>MIME::Base64 is a Perl module that you can get from CPAN
(http://www.perl.com/CPAN/) for handling MIME-standard mail. I
cannot remember the last time that I had to write a program to
handle e-mail encoded with MIME, but the Base64 module comes in
handy for non-mail applications such as this one.</p><p>If you have any experience with securing computer networks,
you might be surprised to learn that user names and passwords are
passed between web browsers and servers unencrypted. Indeed, while
the text isn't passed completely in the clear, it would require
another one-line Perl program to turn the Base64-encoded user name,
password string back into its ASCII original.</p><p>Suffice it to say that this is not a very secure scheme.
Someone monitoring packets sent over the network would have to work
a bit harder in order to capture your user name and password, but
not significantly harder than if the text were sent without any
transformation.</p><p>At the very least, make sure to use user names and passwords
that have nothing to do with /etc/passwd, the file that typically
stores user information on Linux systems. Your secret documents can
still be available via the Web, but your machine will not be open
to break-ins which are a much more serious threat. (Someone who
breaks into your computer can do much more than just read your
documents.)</p><p>An authentication scheme known as &ldquo;Digest&rdquo; will soon be
available. It is already available in Apache and is waiting for a
browser to implement it. The digest method applies a function to a
number of parameters, including the user name and password that are
going to be sent, and a number generated by the server that is sent
as part of the headers in the <b  >401 -- Authorization
required</b> response. The result of the digest function is
then sent over the network, rather than the user name and password
themselves. This is not a foolproof system, but it is far better
than the current situation in which your passwords are easily
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x135f7e8"></a>Creating a Password File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have discussed the theory behind all of this, we
will take a look at what is necessary to protect directories on
your server.</p><p>The first thing you need is a file in which user names and
passwords can be stored. Apache comes with a program,
<span   class="bold"><b>htpasswd</b></span> which can be used to
create and modify such files. The syntax is fairly simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
htpasswd [-c] passwordfile username
</pre><p>To create a new password file (or overwrite an existing one),
use the following syntax:
<pre     class="programlisting">
htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/conf/passwords reuven
</pre>


If you enter the above line at the Linux shell (with htpasswd in
your <b  >$PATH</b> environment variable), you will be
prompted for a password. After you have entered the password twice,
the user name, password pair will be stored in the file you
specified.
</p><p>The <b  >-c</b> option creates a new file or
overwrites an existing one. (This option is unnecessary to create a
user; you can do that without the <b  >-c</b> option, as
described below.) Be especially careful with the
<b  >-c</b> option, because it overwrites old versions of
the password file without warning or making backups.</p><p>To add a user to an existing password file or to change the
password of an existing user, invoke htpasswd without the
<b  >-c</b> option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
htpasswd /etc/httpd/conf/passwords reuven
</pre><p>Regardless of whether you are adding a new user or changing
an existing user's password, you will be asked to enter the user's
password twice. When you have done that, the named file will be
updated.
</p><p>The password file contains nothing more than names and
encrypted passwords in the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
username1:password1
username2:password2
username3:password3
</pre><p>For example, the password file that I created for this column
contains the following entries:
<pre     class="programlisting">
reuven:zZDDIZ0NOlPzw
reena:SjCCCbsjjz2Z2
foobar:RpubVfdhWwv1U
</pre>


If you expect to handle many authorized user requests on your
system and if the number of users on your server is high, you might
want to consider using authorization using a more efficient system,
such as DBM or DB. Support for DB and DBM are available for modern
versions of Apache (although the appropriate module must be
compiled in), as is support for a number of relational databases,
including Msql and MySQL. More information on these options is
available on the Apache web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x13567b0"></a>Protecting Directories</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a list of user names and passwords in the
correct format, we can use that list to protect the directories on
our server. Each directory can use a different file containing user
names and passwords&mdash;so your &ldquo;top-secret&rdquo; directory can have a
different list of users than your &ldquo;secret&rdquo; directory.</p><p>There are two ways to protect files on your system. One is to
put a file, called .htaccess by default, in the directory you wish
to protect. This gives you the flexibility to modify individual
directories quickly and easily and to give responsibility for
different directories to the people in charge of those
directories&mdash;but it also removes a certain element of central
control.</p><p>We will thus look at the method in which access restrictions
are defined in srm.conf, one of the Apache configuration files.
Placing the access restrictions in srm.conf means you will have
centralized control of access to your server, and you will have to
restart the server each time you make changes.</p><p>Protected directories are declared in srm.conf within
<b  >&lt;Directory&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/Directory&gt;</b> statements with a relatively
straightforward syntax. For instance, I added the following lines
in this file to protect directories used in this article:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /home/httpd/html/private&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName TestRealmName
  AuthUserFile /tmp/authusers
  require valid-user
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>The first and last lines confine these declarations to
/home/httpd/html/private, the protected directory on my server.
Someone requesting a file within /home/httpd/html (the root
directory on my web server) can do so without having to enter a
user name or password. Someone trying to retrieve a file in
/home/httpd/html/private (known as /private to the outside world),
or in any subdirectory of /private, will have to enter a user name
and password.
</p><p>The user name, password pair is be passed using the &ldquo;basic&rdquo;
authentication scheme that we saw earlier, in which user name,
password is encoded using Base64 and sent as part of the HTTP
headers following the request. Until browsers begin to support the
&ldquo;digest&rdquo; method (or even more secure methods), all protected
directories should declare the AuthType to be &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;.</p><p>AuthName is a way of identifying this directory to the
outside world. You might want to call the directory something
meaningful, such as &ldquo;Joe's private directory&rdquo;, or &ldquo;FYI&rdquo;. You
might use AuthName to distinguish between different protected
sections of your web server, such as &ldquo;private area&rdquo; and &ldquo;staff
area&rdquo;. AuthName is generally displayed in the dialog box into
which a user can enter her user name and password.</p><p>Next, we indicate which password file should be used for this
directory. As mentioned earlier, each directory can use a separate
password file, so it is important to specify which one you wish to
use. If you expect to use more than a few password files on your
system, you might want to investigate the use of groups, which
allow you to grant privileges to different subsets of users in a
single password file. (Users can be placed in groups, which we will
not address here, but which allow you to associate each user in the
password file with one or more groups).</p><p>Finally, we indicate that we will allow only valid users,
meaning only those whose user names and passwords are in the
password file named in AuthUserFile. You could also specify
individual users who would be allowed into the site, such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
require user reuven reena
</pre><p>Once you have placed this information in your server's
srm.conf file, you need to tell the server to reread its
configuration file. You can do this by shutting the server down and
then restarting it or by sending it a HUP signal, as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
killall -v -1 httpd
</pre>


This command sends a HUP signal (aka signal #1) to all instances of
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> currently running. Remember
that Apache normally runs a number of servers simultaneously, so
trying to identify individual processes and use the standard
<b  >kill</b> command is probably not a good way to go
about it.
</p><p>Once you have restarted the server, protected directories are
only accessible to someone whose user name and password appears in
one of these directories. If you want to test the protection
mechanism, using TELNET (as described above) to pretend to be a web
browser might be the best way to do it, in order to avoid a
browser's cache of passwords.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1266580.0x1356e90"></a>Using This Information in CGI Programs</h2></div></div><p>Just as you can protect directories containing HTML files and
pictures, you can also protect directories containing CGI programs.
For instance, if you want to make a selected number of CGI programs
accessible only to a select number of users, you can define
/cgi-bin/private in the same way as you did /private.</p><p>Here, for example, is the definition that I added to srm.conf
in order to protect /cgi-bin/private:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin/private&gt;
AuthType Basic
AuthName TestRealmName
AuthUserFile /tmp/authusers
require valid-user
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, the definition is identical to that for
/private, except for the name of the directory.
</p><p>In this case, we will be asked for a user name, password
combination if we try to execute a CGI program in this directory,
using either GET or POST. (Apache allows you to set a separate
access privilege for each method, so you could allow all users to
GET but a restricted group to POST and still others to PUT and
DELETE.) Before the request will actually be sent to the CGI
program in question, we will have to authenticate ourselves.</p><p>One of the nice benefits of protecting CGI directories is
that all programs in that directory immediately have access to a
new environment variable, REMOTE_USER, which contains the name of
the user in question. This is available to CGI programs written in
Perl and using CGI.pm via the
<span   class="bold"><b>remote_user</b></span> method, but all
programs can retrieve the value of the environment variable.</p><p>How can this be of use? Well, we know that the user name must
be unique; no two users can share a user name. Thus, we can use the
user name as a primary key (i.e., a unique index) into a table in a
relational database containing more information about the user&mdash;his
or her age, interests and last visit.</p><p>Indeed, over the last few months, this column has looked at a
variety of techniques for keeping track of information about users,
most often by setting an HTTP cookie on the user's computer and
setting a primary key value in the cookie.</p><p>The advantage of this system is that the user must verify his
or her identity before being allowed to access the program&mdash;meaning
that by the time the CGI program is executed, we can be sure that
the user name exists, is associated with a real user and that this
user represents that person (or has access to the user's password).
HTTP cookies operate on a per-computer basis; if someone were to
use my computer while I am not looking, they could retrieve
information from all of the private sites from which I have
retrieved cookies.</p><p>Another advantage of using this form of identification rather
than cookies is that it gives the user mobility. No longer is the
user tied to a particular computer or browser. While users must
sign in before being allowed to use the site, they can access the
site from anywhere rather than just from their computer at work or
home.</p><p>There are disadvantages, too&mdash;the main one is the inherent
insecurity associated with the basic authentication scheme. And
some users prefer not to be bothered with having to enter their
user name and password each time they visit a site. Such users
would rather the site recognize and remember their settings
automatically.</p><p><a href="2730l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is a short CGI
program written in Perl that identifies the user name entered. If
this program is placed in an unprotected directory, it will
indicate that no value for REMOTE_USER is available. If run from
within a protected directory, however, it will return the user name
that was used to access that directory.</p><p>If you were to create a table in a relational database (such
as MySQL), you could define the primary key to be a user name of no
more than eight characters. The value of remote_user could then be
used as a reliable index into the database.</p><p>Protecting web sites is sure to be an increasingly important
topic as the Web continues to mature. Apache is remarkably flexible
when it comes to such security mechanisms. While I mentioned
groups, there was not enough space to discuss additional options,
such as restricting access by domain or IP address. See the Apache
documentation for more information on this issue and the sidebar
for additional sources.</p><p>While user name, password combinations are useful for
restricting access to a web site, they can also be used to produce
a unique key into a database. If you are thinking of creating a
database to keep track of your users, you might want to consider
using access controls to force users to log in.</p><p>Restricting access to directories on your web site is neither
complicated nor difficult and lets you put sensitive or private
materials on the Web without having to worry about someone
discovering a secret URL.</p><p><a href="2730s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
