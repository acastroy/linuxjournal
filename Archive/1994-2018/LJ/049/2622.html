    Mr. Vaught shows programmers a few commands to determine
    which sections of their code need optimization.

he thought his program wasn't running fast enough. &ldquo;Have you
profiled it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;No, but I'm pretty sure I know where the
bottleneck is,&rdquo; he replied&mdash;famous last words. &ldquo;Well, let's try
the profiler,&rdquo; I said. Profiling quickly revealed that 98% of the
CPU was being spent in one subroutine of my friend's program and
that 86% of the CPU was being spent in <span   class="emphasis"><em>one
line</em></span>, and he was wrong about the location of the
bottleneck.
</p><p>Profilers are invaluable tools that let you know where a
program is spending most of its time. This information is extremely
valuable because it tells you where your time can best be spent in
making your program more efficient and where you are wasting your
time. Typical programs are not quite as lopsided as in the above
story. The &ldquo;80-20&rdquo; rule says that a program will spend 80% of its
time in about 20% of the code.</p><p>If the total running time of a program is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, then we can break up the running time into
pieces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
total-time = a1*n + a2*n + a3*n + ...
</pre><p>where the &ldquo;a&rdquo;s represent fractions of the total time that
your program spends in a particular segment. The sum of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;s
must add to one. The 80-20 rule says that one of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;s will be
quite large. For example, suppose a1 is 8/10 and a2 is 2/10. These
numbers correspond to a program which spends 80% of its time doing
a1 and 20% for everything else.
<pre     class="programlisting">
total-time = .8*n + .2*n
</pre>


Now suppose we optimize a2 so that it runs twice as fast as
before&mdash;a significant speedup. The time 0.2*n is now 0.1*n. The
total running time is now 0.8n+0.1n = 0.9n, meaning the whole
program executes in 90% of the time that it originally did. Suppose
we instead concentrate on the other piece. If we halve the running
time of the first piece, it becomes 0.4n. 0.4n+0.2n=0.6n, or 60% of
the original running time. As you can see, it is worth our while to
concentrate on the particular portion of the program that dominates
the runtime.
</p><p>In my friend's case, we were able to optimize that single
line a bit. The real optimization came two days later when he told
me that he had removed the whole subroutine in question, simply by
changing how he thought about his data.</p><p>The easiest profiler to use under Linux is the
<span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> profiler.
<span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> is a standard part of the
GNU development tools. If you have
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> installed, you probably have
gprof too. To use gprof, simply recompile your program with gcc
using the <b  >-pg</b> switch. This option causes gcc to
insert a bit of extra code into the beginning of each subroutine in
your program. The <b  >-pg</b> switch must also be used
when you link your program, since another snippet of code must be
present to tie the pieces together.</p><p>After recompiling, run your program. It will execute slightly
slower because of the work needed to profile the code, but it
shouldn't be too slow. After the program finishes, there will be a
file named gmon.out in the current directory. This file contains
the profiling information collected during the program's run.
<span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> is used to print this in a
human readable form.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> outputs information in
two ways: a flat profile and a call graph. The flat profile tells
you how much time the program spent in all of the subroutines, and
the call graph tells you which subroutines called which
subroutines.</p><p>The first part of a flat profile is shown in
<a href="2622l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. The &ldquo;self seconds&rdquo;
column shows how much time was taken up by each subroutine. The
number of times each subroutine was invoked is shown in the
&ldquo;calls&rdquo; column. The &ldquo;self ms/call&rdquo; columns gives the average
time in milliseconds spent in a given subroutine, while the &ldquo;total
ms/call&rdquo; includes time spent in subroutines called by that
subroutine as well. For reasons explained in the gprof
documentation, this last column is actually only a guess and should
not be relied upon.</p><p>In this example, an important thing to note is that the
<span   class="bold"><b>mcount</b></span> subroutine is the actual
profiling subroutine call inserted by gcc when it compiles code
with the <b  >-pg</b> switch. The fact that the program
spends nearly 20% of its time here indicates that a lot of calling
and returning is happening, and that one way to speed up the code
would be to eliminate some of the subroutine calls. Which ones? The
subroutines <span   class="bold"><b>rnd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>uni</b></span> are likely candidates, since
they are called 142 million times in 900 seconds.</p><p>The other profiler in common use on Linux is
<span   class="bold"><b>bprof</b></span>. The major difference
between bprof and gprof is that bprof gives timings on a source
line basis while gprof has only subroutine-level resolution, and
also includes information like invocation counts. To use bprof,
link an object file, bprof.o, into your program. After you've run
your program, a file named bmon.out contains the timing
information. Run bprof on this data file, and it makes copies of
your source files with timing numbers prepended to each
line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a4580.0x2a9cef8"></a>How the Profilers Work and Why They Sometimes
Don't</h2></div></div><p>The profilers under Linux work by examining the program
counter at regular intervals to see where in the code the program
is actually working. Although easy to implement, there is a
randomness to this process that results in a certain amount of
noise in the measurements. Over &ldquo;long&rdquo; intervals, the amount of
good data overwhelms the noise. This is usually good enough in
practice, when we are only interested in finding the
bottlenecks.</p><p>Both gprof and bprof use timers that only run while your
program is actually running. One of the ways that the kernel can
use a lot of time on your program's behalf is by reading or writing
huge amounts of data. These times do not accumulate into the
profile. A more subtle way in which the kernel can eat a good deal
of time is if your program uses so much memory that the kernel must
swap part of your program in and out of memory. This situation is
called page thrashing because you can usually hear your disk
thrashing around.</p><p>A simple way of checking the system time is to run your
program with this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
time &lt;
</pre><p>After your program finishes, three times are printed: user
time (the time the CPU spent running your program), system time
(the time the CPU spent in the kernel serving your program) and
elapsed time (real time, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;wall clock&rdquo;
time). By comparing these times you can get a rough view of how
much work the kernel is having to do for you.
</p><p>My favorite profiler is a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>pixie</b></span>, which is unfortunately not
available for Linux. Pixie works by actually reading the
executable, inserting counting code into &ldquo;basic blocks&rdquo; of code
that can only be entered at the start and exited at the end.
Support exists in gcc today for counting execution of these basic
blocks (the <b  >-a</b> option), but getting actual times
for each block is not yet supported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a4580.0x2a9d268"></a>Using the Profile</h2></div></div><p>So now you know the location of the bottleneck in your
program. There are a couple of simple techniques for making things
go faster. The easiest is of course to use the
<b  >-O</b> flag of gcc to optimize the code. Be warned
that optimizers are notorious for generating bad code.</p><p>It is often possible to decrease running time in exchange for
an increase in space. Consider the following (FORTRAN) code
fragment in <a href="2622l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>Profiling revealed that the program was spending over a
quarter of its time in this loop, not just because it is slow, but
because it was also being called frequently. Since it is called
frequently, the variables cx, cy and cz are recalculated for each
loop iteration. If we precalculate these values into the
<b  >tcentr()</b> array, four array references, three
floating-point additions and a multiplication are replaced by a
single array reference. A lot of code in a critical loop is thereby
eliminated.</p><p>The cherry on this is moving the multiplication by 0.25
(multiplication by 0.25 is faster than dividing by 4.0) out of the
loop altogether; thus, instead of multiplying each element of the
sum by 0.25, we multiply the whole sum by 0.25. Since the loop
happened to execute about 100,000 times or so, we've eliminated
99,999 floating-point multiplies. The new code is shown in
<a href="2622l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p><p>At this point, the program was profiled again, and this
subroutine had dropped to taking 15% of the total time with 10%
being taken up by the square root calculation. Since a different
subroutine was now dominating the run time, the focus of the
optimization effort moved away from this subroutine.</p><p>There is one more semi-easy thing that can be done for this
code. It happens that the square roots are known to be needed for a
very limited range of values. So, we can replace the square root
function with a function that outputs the same value by looking up
precalculated values in a table and returning an interpolated value
for values that occur between table entries. Again, we have traded
space for time.</p><p>Another common way of speeding up a program is to replace
array references with pointers. In the example at the start of this
article, the line that accounted for 98% of my friend's program
looked like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int i, array[1000000];
...
 i = 0;
 while(array[i] == 0) i++;
</pre><p>This line searches for the next non-zero element of an array.
The operation of referencing the array consists of multiplying
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> times a scaling factor (which is implemented
as binary left shifts), adding this value to the start of array[]
and fetching from that location. Replacing this code with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int *p, i, array[1000000];
...
 p = array;
 while(*p == 0) p++;
 i = p - array;
</pre>


eliminates the scaling and addition and sped things up by about
10%.
</p><p>Another change we tried in this case was unrolling the loop.
The code is replaced by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int *p, i, array[1000000];
...
 p = array;
 for(;;) {
 if (*p++ != 0) break;
 if (*p++ != 0) break;
 if (*p++ != 0) break;
 if (*p++ != 0) break;
 }
</pre><p>The idea here is that on certain types of machines, taking a
branch is expensive while rejecting a branch is cheap. In a very
tight loop, the overhead of the loop can end up being a significant
part of the total time. The code in the second example has been
rewritten so that most branches are not taken and that more work is
done in the body of the loop for each iteration of the loop.
</p><p>As it turned out, this &ldquo;optimization&rdquo; didn't speed anything
up for the machine we were using. A good compiler compiling with
<b  >-O</b> will unroll short loops for you. It is
important to profile before and after to see if what you've done
has helped or hurt.</p><p>The other main option for optimizing code consists of simply
looking for a better algorithm. For example, suppose we want to
search an array for a particular entry. If the array is very small,
we can simply check each element in turn. When the number of
elements becomes large, hash tables are a quick and easy way to
prune the number of elements that must be searched. For data that
cannot be hashed, tree seaches provide another alternative. Hashing
and trees are beyond the scope of this article, but should be a
part of any programmer's bag of tricks. Any good book on data
structures can show you how they work.</p><p>Machine specific optimizations are generally best left to the
compiler. Compilers are becoming quite good with the simplest sort
of optimizations, and gcc is one of the best. Once the profiler has
located the slow portion of the program, the best way to optimize
it is to simply imagine having to calculate everything by hand.
Hopefully, you will notice improvements that a compiler will
miss.</p><p>After all, the perfect compiler will never be written. There
is an old joke that once a computer is built that can write code as
well as a person, that computer will expect to be paid for its
work. Hey, it's job security.</p></div></div>
