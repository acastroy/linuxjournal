    The ADT concept is at the heart of object-oriented
    programming and cross-platform development. Mr. Nobile gives
    us an example with his doubly linked list libraries.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Experienced C programmers seeking relief
from the drudgery of writing linked lists and dealing with the
attending problems of keeping them, somehow, isolated from the rest
of their code will appreciate this doubly linked list library.
Those who are at an earlier stage in their C programming may also
find here a useful tool for enhancing their cross-platform
programming skills, as this linked list can serve as an example of
an abstract data type (ADT).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c4a8"></a>What is an Abstract Data Type?</h2></div></div><p>Using ADTs allows the data in a specific piece of code to be
hidden from other pieces of code that don't need and shouldn't have
access to it. This is often called modular programming or
encapsulation. The idea behind the ADT is to hide the actual
implementation of the code, leaving only its abstraction visible.
In order to do this, one needs to find a clear division between the
linked list code and the surrounding code. When the linked list
code is removed, what remains is its logical abstraction. This
separation makes the code less dependent on any one platform. Thus,
programming using the ADT method is usually considered a necessity
for cross-platform development as it makes maintenance and
management of the application code much easier.</p><p>The ADT concept is developed here via the example of how the
doubly linked list <span   class="emphasis"><em>Application Programming
Interface</em></span> (API) was created. The doubly linked list
(DLL) can also be an independent C module and compiled into a
larger program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c660"></a>The Doubly Linked List</h2></div></div><p>The DLL package consists of two C modules: dll_main.c
comprises the DLL itself and dll_test.c creates an executable
program for testing the DLL's functionality. There are also three
header files: dll_main.h is included in dll_main.c, linklist.h is
included in your application program, and dll_dbg.h is used for
debugging the DLL or the DLL's implementation in your application.
A word of warning needs to be expressed here: the header dll_dbg.h
should never be compiled into a production program, as doing so
circumvents the whole concept of ADT programming. The entire
package has been compiled on three platforms with four compilers
and includes three of the respective Makefiles. Only one of the
platforms exhibited any problem because of a compiler that was not
fully ANSI compatible. More will be said about platforms
later.</p><p>Before we get into the philosophy behind this DLL, I want to
explain what my goals were when I decided to write this library. It
first had to be platform-independent and instantiable; in other
words, the DLL had to handle an unlimited number of instances of
linked lists in any one or multiple programs concurrently. Also, it
had to be robust.</p><p><a href="2693f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Layout of Doubly Linked List in memory.</b></span></a> The
arrows indicate to what the Prior and Next pointers point. The
Current pointer can point to any Node Struct, so it is
open-ended.</p><p>In order to fulfill the first requirement, I decided to
strictly adhere to the ANSI C standard, and, with the possible
exception of how one sets up one's data and uses the DLL's
input/output functions, there should be no endian (byte order)
problems. The second requirement was met with the creation of a
top-level structure. There is only one of these structures per
linked list. It keeps track of the node pointers, the size of the
applications data in bytes, how many nodes are in the list, whether
or not the list has been modified since it was created or loaded
into memory, where searching starts from, and what direction a
search proceeds in. Figure 1 illustrates how the top-level
structure is integrated into the DLL.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct list
  {
  Node      *head;
  Node      *tail;
  Node      *current;
  Node      *saved;
  size_t     infosize;
  unsigned long listsize;
  DLL_Boolean  modified;
  DLL_SrchOrigin search_origin;
  DLL_SrchDir  search_dir;
  } List;
</pre><p>This and the next <span   class="emphasis"><em>typedef</em></span> structure
remain hidden from the application program. The node pointers
mentioned above are defined in the next structure, which includes
the pointers to the application's data and the pointers to the next
and prior nodes. One of these structures is created for each node
in the list.
<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct node
  {
  Info    *info;
  struct node *next;
  struct node *prior;
  } Node;
</pre>


The last definition is a dummy <span   class="emphasis"><em>typedef</em></span> of the
user's data. It is defined as type <span   class="emphasis"><em>void</em></span> so
that the DLL's functions will be able to handle any of C's or an
application's data types.
<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef void Info;
</pre>


As you can see, if the two structures mentioned above are hidden
from the application, all of the ugly innards of how the linked
list operates will by default be hidden from the application. Thus,
we have an abstract data type.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275cb88"></a>Application Programming Interface</h2></div></div><p>The interface itself follows logically. The first argument of
all the DLL's API functions is a pointer of type
<b  >List</b>. This pointer can easily be changed to
different lists, thereby accommodating the instantiation
requirement of the DLL.</p><p>The API's 25 functions are broken down into seven function
groups: three initialization, three status, four data modification,
six pointer manipulation, six search, two input/output and one
miscellaneous. The initialization group handles the creation,
initialization and destruction of the DLL. The status group returns
various types of information about the DLL. The pointer
manipulation group allows the arbitrary repositioning of the
current pointer. The data modification group adds and deletes
nodes. The search group returns node information based on keyed
data fields or on absolute node position. The input/output group
saves or retrieves node data to or from a disk file. The
miscellaneous group currently only supports version
information.</p><p>The function prototypes that follow will return two or more
<b  >enum</b> types or the <b  >boolean</b>
type. Some functions have a <b  >void</b> return
value.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef enum
  {
  DLL_NORMAL,       /* normal operation */
  DLL_MEM_ERROR,    /* malloc error */
  DLL_ZERO_INFO,    /* sizeof(Info) is zero */
  DLL_NULL_LIST,    /* List is NULL */
  DLL_NOT_FOUND,    /* Record not found */
  DLL_OPEN_ERROR,   /* Cannot open file */
  DLL_WRITE_ERROR,  /* File write error */
  DLL_READ_ERROR,   /* File read error */
  DLL_NOT_MODIFIED, /* Unmodified list */
  DLL_NULL_FUNCTION /* NULL function pointer */
  } DLL_Return;
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef enum
  {
  DLL_FALSE,
  DLL_TRUE,
  } DLL_Boolean;
</pre><p>What follows is a short description of all the functions in
the API. It is not possible to describe all the intricacies of how
the functions are called and what they each return in a short
article like this. For this information, refer to the documentation
and source code in the distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275cfa8"></a>Initialization</h2></div></div><p>First we need to create a list pointer.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
List *listname = NULL;
</pre><p>To create the top-level structure, execute the following
function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
List *DLL_CreateList(List **name);
</pre>


After this structure is created it needs to be initialized using
the next function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_InitializeList(List *list,
 size_t infosize);
</pre>


That's it&mdash;one instance of the DLL is ready to work with; however,
there is one last function in this group that is used when we want
to permanently remove the list and the top-level structure.
<pre     class="programlisting">
void DLL_DestroyList(List **name);
</pre>


Notice the pointer to pointer notation again; this is used so that
<b  >name</b> can be returned as a
<b  >NULL</b> pointer. The C standard function
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> does not set the pointer; it
is passed to <b  >NULL</b> after deallocating its memory.
This can cause a possible problem if that pointer should
unwittingly be reused.
</p><p>I've written a template (see <a href="2693l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>) of the initialization sequence. This and the source code
in the distribution should help in using the DLL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275d478"></a>Status</h2></div></div><p>The next function tests pointers in the top-level structure
to determine if there are any nodes in a list.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Boolean DLL_IsListEmpty(List *list);
</pre><p>The inverse of this function, which follows, creates a new
node to see if there is enough memory for a new node. If there is
sufficient memory, the temporary node is freed.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Boolean DLL_IsListFull(List *list);
</pre>


To get the number of nodes (records) in the list use this next
function.
<pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long DLL_GetNumberOfRecords(List *list);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275d6e0"></a>Data Modification</h2></div></div><p>The process of adding new nodes to the linked list can be as
easy or as complex as you desire. The following function has the
ability to do an insertion sort as it adds nodes or just stick the
nodes on the end. Don't let the list of arguments scare you; the
function prototyping makes it look worse than it really is.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_AddRecord(List *list, Info *info,
 int (*pFun)(Info *, Info *));
</pre><p>The first argument is a pointer to the top-level structure,
which is the same in all the functions. The second argument is a
pointer to the data you want to put into the linked list. The third
and last argument points to an optional function that you could
write, which determines the sort criteria.
</p><p>It is worth reviewing how this function should be written, as
it shows up again in two other functions described below. It
emulates the way the C standard function
<span   class="bold"><b>strcmp</b></span> returns its value. As a
matter of fact, it can be just that.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int compare(Info *newnode, Info *keylist)
  {
  return(strcmp(newnode-&gt;key_element,
  keylist-&gt;key_element));
  }
</pre><p>Updating the current node (record) is a must in any linked
list implementation, and this DLL API is no exception.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_UpdateCurrentRecord(List *list,
 Info *record);
</pre>


We would also want to delete the current record.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_DeleteCurrentRecord(List *list);
</pre>


The last function in this group deletes the entire list but not the
top-level structure.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_DeleteEntireList(List *list);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275db00"></a>Pointer Manipulation</h2></div></div><p>As shown above, there are four pointers in the top-level
structure. We concern ourselves here with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>current</em></span> pointer. This pointer is where all the
power in the DLL comes from and is used in many of the DLL's
functions to determine what to work on.</p><p>The next two functions move the current pointer to the head
or tail of the list.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_CurrentPointerToHead(List *list);
DLL_Return DLL_CurrentPointerToTail(List *list);
</pre><p>Often, incrementing or decrementing the pointer is necessary:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_IncrementCurrentPointer(List *list);
DLL_Return DLL_DecrementCurrentPointer(List *list);
</pre>


It is sometimes desirable to store the <span   class="emphasis"><em>current</em></span>
pointer, then do something else, and then restore the pointer. We
take care of this in the next two functions.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_StoreCurrentPointer(List *list);
</pre>


<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_RestoreCurrentPointer(List *list);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2754758"></a>Search</h2></div></div><p>There is little use having a linked list if you cannot find
what has been stored in it. The following functions let you find
your data and specify exactly how that data will be found.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_FindRecord(List *list, Info *record,
        Info *match, int (*pFun)(Info *, Info *));
</pre><p>The first argument, as usual, is the pointer to the linked
list. The second is a pointer to the returned data. The third is a
pointer to the matching criteria, and the last argument is a
pointer to the <span   class="bold"><b>compare</b></span> function
that was previously described in the data modification group. This
compare function can be constructed differently, but the idea is
the same.
</p><p>Now life gets a little difficult. The above function needs to
know how to look for the data in the linked list. Does it look down
from the head pointer, up from the tail pointer, or up or down from
the current pointer? My solution to this problem was to use a state
table.</p><p>There are two more <b  >typedef</b> enumerations
needed, relating to the state table, one to set the origin of the
search and the other to set its direction.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef enum
  {
  DLL_ORIGIN_DEFAULT,  /* Use current origin
                        * setting */
  DLL_HEAD,    /* Set origin to head pointer */
  DLL_CURRENT, /* Set origin to current pointer */
  DLL_TAIL     /* Set origin to tail pointer */
  } DLL_SrchOrigin;
typedef enum
  {
  DLL_DIRECTION_DEFAULT, /* Use current direction
                          * setting */
  DLL_DOWN,    /* Set direction to down */
  DLL_UP,      /* Set direction to up */
  } DLL_SrchDir;
</pre><p>The state table defaults at initialization to
<b  >DLL_HEAD</b> and <b  >DLL_DOWN</b>. The
<b  >DLL_FindRecord</b> function uses these values if not
changed. To change the operation of this function, use the next two
functions shown. If no change is desired in either of these two
functions, use <b  >DLL_ORIGIN_DEFAULT</b> or
<b  >DLL_DIRECTION_DEFAULT</b>. The first function sets
the table to new values:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_SetSearchModes(List *list,
        DLL_SrchOrigin origin, DLL_SrchDir dir);
</pre>


The second function returns a pointer of a copy of the state table
to the following structure:
<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct search_modes
  {
  DLL_SrchOrigin search_origin;
  DLL_SrchDir  search_dir;
  } DLL_SearchModes;
</pre>


The purpose of this function is to check how a succeeding search
will be conducted by interrogating the state table.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_GetSearchModes(List *list);
</pre>


Last in this group are three functions that return data relative to
the location of the current pointer. They are not affected by the
state table.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_GetCurrentRecord(List *list,
        Info *record);
DLL_Return DLL_GetPriorRecord(List *list,
        Info *record);
DLL_Return DLL_GetNextRecord(List *list,
        Info *record);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2754e38"></a>Input/Output</h2></div></div><p>Generally, input and output functions would not be considered
a part of a linked list implementation; however, they do make life
a bit easier when using ADTs. Without these functions one would
have to set the current pointer to the head or tail of the list and
then make repeated calls to one of the DLL_Get functions mentioned
above. If sorting during this process were needed, the task would
be even more tedious.</p><p>Writing to or reading from a disk tends to be very platform
specific. I have striven to make the next two functions as generic
as possible; they open files in binary mode and write or read the
<b  >Info</b> structure from beginning to end. Depending
on how you enter data in the <b  >Info</b> structure will
determine if there will be any endian problems.</p><p>To save a list, determine the full path to the file, then
pass its pointer to the next function. There are no sorting options
with this function, because the list is presumably sorted in memory
and will be saved in that order.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_SaveList(List *list,
        const char *path);
</pre><p>When loading a file from disk, you have the option of sorting
the list as it comes into memory. Passing a <b  >NULL</b>
loads the file as it exists on the disk and loads it faster than if
the list is sorted.
<pre     class="programlisting">
DLL_Return DLL_LoadList(List *list,
   const char *path, int (*pFun)(Info *, Info *));
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2755200"></a>Miscellaneous</h2></div></div><p>This last group has only one function in that it returns
version information, so a program can determine if it is linking to
a different version and check for any incompatibilities.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
char *DLL_Version(void);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2755360"></a>What Use is It?</h2></div></div><p>The short answer is it is used for just about any type of
data storage where you don't know how much data is to be stored.
One example that I've been working with is 3D graphics data where
there could be an unknown number of objects in a scene. I've
written bar code scanning software that uses this DLL to keep track
of all the hand-held terminals that are in use. I also worked on a
database conversion program that reads data into one linked list,
allowing you to edit it; it then converts the data to another
linked list and writes it out again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2755468"></a>Compiling</h2></div></div><p>I'll mainly concentrate on compiling the Linux version;
however, there are two Makefiles for DOS: one that compiles using
the DJGPP GNU compiler and the other for the MS6.0 compiler. All
three Makefiles are included in the distribution. If anyone is
interested, there is also a slightly modified version of the DLL
that compiles on Big Blues 4690 OS (FlexOS) using the Metaware C
compiler (this OS is used in point-of-sale systems).</p><p>First, we need to use <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> to
extract the files into the directory where you want it to
reside.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvzf linklist.1.0.0.tar.gz -C /your/path
</pre><p>The tar file will create a directory named linklist and put
everything in it. Next, use <span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span> to
move to the linklist directory and type one of the following,
assuming you're using the GNU compiler:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make
</pre>


creates a shared library, or
<pre     class="programlisting">
make static
</pre>


creates a static library.
</p><p>To install the library in the /usr/local/lib directory, enter
either <b  >make install</b> or <b  >make
install-static</b>.</p><p>That's all there is to it. You're now ready to write some
code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x2755938"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The concept of the ADT is at the core of object-oriented
programming and, as mentioned previously, central to cross-
platform development. My linked list example should be of use as
either a practical or a learning tool.</p></div></div>
