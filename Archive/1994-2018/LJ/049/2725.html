    A quick look at two projects designed to make the
    administration and usage of a Linux system easier for
    beginners.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c2580.0x11ba4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Watching the Linux operating system
mature is interesting these days. A couple of years ago a lot of
attention was devoted to incompatibilities with various hardware
components, networking and the development of the kernel. Though
these activities continue, it's no longer necessary to follow these
development efforts as closely in order to run a dependable Linux
system. Distributions have improved immensely, and now more
free-software developers are turning their attention towards
refinement and integration of the user interface.
</p><p>Two separate projects have arisen in the past year: KDE (the
K Desktop Environment) and GNOME (the Gnu Network Object Model
Environment). Both of these projects include among their stated
goals the desire to make the administration and usage of a Linux
system easier for beginners, in part by providing a uniform look
and feel for the most commonly used applications and utilities, as
well as interoperability of the system components. It's difficult
to make much of a comparison between the two, as KDE is much
farther along than GNOME, but I'll make an attempt.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c2580.0x11ba608"></a>Commonalities</h2></div></div><p>There is one common structural aspect to these two projects.
They each rely on a group of shared libraries that provides the
interface to basic OS operations, such as file-reading and saving,
as well as basic display and appearance functions. An installation
will populate a directory with a variety of shared libraries which
support a directory of fairly small executables. The Gimp works
this way as well; the individual plug-ins tend to be small, but
rely on the services provided by both the GTK and the GIMP shared
libraries. This approach facilitates contributions by programmers
not directly involved with a project, as many of the low-level and
window-display functions are already written, allowing a
contributed application or extension to &ldquo;hook&rdquo; into them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c2580.0x11ba710"></a>KDE</h2></div></div><p>The first of the two projects to gain momentum was KDE. About
a year ago a group of developers, mainly European, began coding the
components of this ambitious project. They chose the Qt toolkit
(from TrollTech in Norway) as the GUI framework, a decision which
has since led to some controversy. Qt has a few licensing
restrictions which, though not onerous for end-users, can cause
problems for the creators of CD-ROM-based distributions. Advocates
of GNU-style free software tend not to favor Qt, a circumstance
which led to the creation of the GNOME project.
</p><p>Setting aside the thorny licensing issues, the KDE developers
have managed to pull together quite a remarkable system in the past
year, though numerous bugs still remain evident. The second public
beta was released in November of 1997, and I compiled and installed
it soon after. (I had briefly tried the initial beta, but found it
too unstable to evaluate.)</p><p>This second release still has flaky aspects, but enough of it
works to give the user an idea of what the developers are planning
to accomplish. In effect KDE is a sort of GUI wrapper around an
existing Linux system, which attempts to simplify
system-administration tasks and offer interactive compatible
utilities and applications. <span   class="bold"><b>kfm</b></span> is
at the core of the system, as it is intended to be left running in
the background and serves as the help viewer for all of the KDE
components. <span   class="bold"><b>kfm</b></span> is also a file
manager (icon-based, with some resemblance to
<span   class="bold"><b>xfm</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>moxfm</b></span>) and serves creditably as a
web browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>kfm</b></span> is an impressive
application, and itself a good reason for trying out KDE. Many of
the other applications are replacements for programs which most
Linux users probably already have and would only be desirable if a
complete KDE system were the goal.</p><p>KDE has its own window manager,
<span   class="bold"><b>kwm</b></span>, which had some display faults
on my system. Due to these video artifacts I didn't use it much,
but it did appear stylish and well-designed. It seems that these
display bugs don't show up on most systems; I suspect that it
depends upon the video-card and X server being used.</p><p>A new Linux user (especially someone accustomed to Windows or
Macintosh systems) might appreciate the relative ease of
configuration and use which KDE offers. In a sense, KDE extends the
scope of the tasks traditional distributions perform. One drawback
might be the very comfort of the KDE environment; the various
system-administration tasks outside of KDE's abilities might seem
too daunting or unapproachable without a KDE interface. This won't
be seen as a drawback to prospective users who lack the fascination
with internals and configuration which in the past has typified
Linux users.</p><p>Some KDE users have reported that they find the system both
usable and useful, but with my particular setup this wasn't the
case. I have to say that my extensively customized Linux
installation seems perfectly satisfactory as is, and I probably
lack the motivation to spend the time learning to adapt KDE to my
needs. If KDE had existed back when I first booted up a Slackware
system some years ago, maybe I would have felt differently.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c2580.0x11bac38"></a>GNOME</h2></div></div><p>Miguel de Icaza, head of the Midnight Commander development
group, also seems to be at the helm of the new GNOME development
project, which has goals similar to those of KDE, with one
difference: the project is composed completely of GNU-style free
software. This project is based upon the GTK toolkit, the free
successor to Motif in the GIMP development efforts. The project
arose as a direct response to the KDE efforts, and the GNOME
developers have borrowed some code from KDE for a few of the
applets.</p><p>As of mid-January (version 0.12) GNOME as a whole isn't
really suitable for actual use, but several of the applets function
well and the future looks bright for the project. Miguel de Icaza
is in the process of porting the Midnight Commander file-manager to
GTK, which will allow it to fit in with the remainder of the GNOME
applications.</p><p>The Panel applet, written primarily by Federico Me&ntilde;a Quintero, is an
  icon-bar and program-launcher which is located at the bottom edge
  of the screen. It features cascading menus which could be a substitute
  for the usual window-manager root menus. Most of the GNOME applets
  have been included in the default menu of Panel, allowing this applet
  to serve as an entry-point to the GNOME installation. It takes a
  little fiddling around to get the hang of using Panel, so don't give
  up if at first glance it seems like nothing is working.</p><p>
  The provided applets include a desktop manager (which in part serves
  as an interface to the Xlockmore screensaver), CroMagnon (an interface
  to the <b  >crontab</b> utility), an audio mixer, an interface to the elaborate LinuxConf configuration manager, several nicely-done games (some of
  which were adapted from KDE), a calculator and several others.</p><p>
  One major difference between GNOME and KDE is that KDE includes a
  window manager, whereas GNOME doesn't. GNOME is designed to cooperate
  with the user's current window manager. This may make GNOME more
  appealing to seasoned users who have extensively customized their
  window-manager resource files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c2580.0x11baef8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
    As I write this, only the source code is available for GNOME 0.12, and
    it's tricky to compile. Several GNU utilities, such as gettext, guile
    and SLIB, must be correctly installed in order for a compilation to complete
    successfully. An intel-Linux binary archive of the 0.9 release is available
    from ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/GNOME, but I would recommend waiting a while
    for either an updated binary release or an easier-to-build source
    release. Another drawback is the lack of any man pages or help files. The
    developers are hard at work these days (judging by their mailing-list
    postings), and I think, given time, that something both interesting and usable
    will appear.</p><p>
    Though KDE is closer to being &ldquo;finished&rdquo; (if such a state even
    exists in the realm of software), it still has a way to go. Development is
    proceeding rapidly, and I imagine that sometime this year a more polished
    release will become available.</p><p>
    The fate of a free-software project is interesting because of the
    inherent unpredictability. Anyone can start one, but whether it comes
    to fruition or withers on the vine is up to the inscrutable software
    gods. The timing may be just right (i.e., the software addresses many users' and
    developers' needs), but convincing enough programmers with time and
    inclination to become involved just can't be forced or foretold. These
    two projects seem to have attained that essential momentum, and
    hopefully we shall see them evolve further.</p></div></div>
