    A major strength of the Common Desktop Evnironment is its programming
    infrastructure, for example, ToolTalk. This article
    illustrates client and server plug-and-play through the use of
    the Desktop's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cc450"></a></h2></div></div><p>ToolTalk, in the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE), is a message brokering system that enables
applications to communicate with each other without having direct
knowledge of one another. Client and server applications can be
developed independently, mixed and matched, and upgraded separately
through plug-and-play. In addition, the Desktop Service can be
called to perform methods on file and buffer objects on behalf of
ToolTalk.
</p><p>Figure 1 shows the ToolTalk Service listening for TtChmod
client requests. ToolTalk Service brokers pattern-matched Chmod
messages to the registered mock change-mode application server
(<span   class="bold"><b>ttchmodd</b></span>) that is waiting to
handle the incoming messages.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2362f1.large.jpg"><img src="2362f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.
</p></div></div><p>ToolTalk brokers the requests from the client to the server
application. The Desktop Service can forward CDE object method
invocations to the ToolTalk Service. With the Desktop, both C
programs and <span   class="bold"><b>dtksh</b></span> scripts can
initiate actions that are transmitted to the ToolTalk Service.
Consequently, client invocations from the
<span   class="bold"><b>dtaction</b></span> command line, application
manager icons, and file manager icons can be directed through the
Desktop Service to ToolTalk application services. Therefore, double
clicking on a file icon in the file manager can be plugged into a
ToolTalk registered application by first routing through the
Desktop action and data-type service.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cc8c8"></a>Ptype</h2></div></div><p>The key to the ToolTalk message brokering system is its
ability to define process-type identifiers with specific operations
and arguments. In <a href="2362l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, the
process-type (ptype) TtChmod will execute the ToolTalk change-mode
daemon application ttchmodd. This occurs when the session operation
Chmod with file name and mode arguments are matched from a request.
Compiling the ptype definition with the
<span   class="bold"><b>tt_type_comp</b></span> utility will register
services for ToolTalk client applications to call. Consider the
ptype as a C header file describing an application programming
interface (API) and the compiled suite of ToolTalk Services
definitions as a library of methods to call. For the list of
installed process-type identifiers, try running
<b  >tt_type_comp&nbsp;-P</b> at the command line to dump
the database to the screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24ccad8"></a>Chmod Service</h2></div></div><p>The file change-mode application
(<span   class="bold"><b>ttchmod</b></span>) described in
<a href="2362l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is simply the Motif
command widget. In Figure 2, the ttchmodd server application
graphically prompts the user for a command, then calls the callback
command <span   class="bold"><b>callCB</b></span> to execute it;
however, for this example, the application just prints the command.
The file change-mode application quickly becomes a plug-and-play
service when it registers itself with the ToolTalk Service, then
listens for messages to be handled by its ToolTalkCB receiver
routine.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2362f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24ccea0"></a>Register ToolTalk Service</h2></div></div><p>An application must first locate the ToolTalk session
associated with the X display to register itself as a service, as
shown in <a href="2362l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. After the
application sets its default session to the display session, the
application can initiate itself as a ToolTalk process and obtain a
ToolTalk file descriptor. When the ttchmodd application gets a
handle on the ToolTalk session, then it can register the TtChmod
process type and join the session to listen for requests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cd000"></a>Handle ToolTalk Requests</h2></div></div><p>ToolTalk sends a message to a registered service; the service
listens on its ToolTalk file descriptor for input. When input is
observed, the ToolTalkCB routine is triggered, and the message is
read and analyzed. (See <a href="2362l4.html" target="_self">Listing
4</a>.) The message's operation is checked, then the arguments
are read from the message. ToolTalk messages are similar to a
reentrant version of an ordinary C program's command-line
arguments. The ttchmodd service is no longer needed after it reads
the message, so the recipient tells the ToolTalk service to discard
the message.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cd160"></a>ToolTalk Client</h2></div></div><p>The ttchmod ToolTalk client (see
<a href="2362l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>) is much simpler than
the ttchmodd ToolTalk server. The client opens a ToolTalk process
and locates the session. The TtChmod process-type message request
consists of the Chmod operation with the file name and mode input
arguments. It is sent to the ToolTalk Service to be brokered to a
registered server application accepting the ptype pattern. However,
note that this example omits error checking and garbage collection
with <span   class="bold"><b>tt_mark</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tt_release</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cd370"></a>Desktop Action</h2></div></div><p>The Desktop Action database in CDE describes methods and
objects for applications to act upon. CDE's Desktop Service can
describe an action like DtChmod, shown in
<a href="2362l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a>, that can be forwarded
through the ToolTalk Service to ttchmodd. If the action does not
receive the appropriate arguments, then the Desktop can prompt the
user, as shown in Figure 3.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2362f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. dtaction
</p></div></div><p>The relationship of the Desktop Action definitions to CDE
methods is similar to the relationship of ptype definitions to
ToolTalk processes. For an example of Desktop actions and data
types, run <span   class="bold"><b>dttypes</b></span> at the command
line to dump the database to the screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cd738"></a>Desktop Service Client</h2></div></div><p>The APIs of the Desktop Service can invoke actions registered
in the Desktop database either from a C program or from a dtksh
script, as shown in <a href="2362l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a>. The
dtchmod.ds dtksh script prompts the user, with the message
dialogue, as shown in Figure 4, to confirm with the user before
requesting changes to the file's mode.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2362f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. dtchmod
</p></div></div><p>In addition to calling Desktop actions from C programs and
dtksh shell scripts, users can initiate requests from the command
line, as shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dtaction DtChmod /etc/motd 644
</pre><p>If the appropriate arguments are given, then the action is
forwarded to ToolTalk; otherwise, the user is first queried, as
shown in Figure 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d4580.0x24cdb58"></a>Plug and Play</h2></div></div><p>We have seen how the ttchmodd service registered with
ToolTalk can receive messages matching the TtChmod ptype pattern
from ToolTalk clients, from Desktop clients written in either C or
dtksh, from the command line and from double clicking on file
object icons. These examples demonstrate how client and server
applications can be developed independently, mixed and matched, and
upgraded separately through plug-and-play. A ToolTalk-enabled
application service registered with its ptype definition can be
developed without specific knowledge of its counterpart.</p><p>CDE defines a message dictionary of desktop-specific ToolTalk
process types, operations and arguments as seen from viewing the
database. Others, such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) services have developed
supplemental dictionaries. You can use existing ptypes or define
your own, but the important point to know is how to register the
process-type identifier, operation and arguments.</p><p><a href="2362s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
