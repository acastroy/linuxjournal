  <p>Several months ago at the office, we decided to use a retired database server as a company news server. The box in question was a Pentium-Pro 200 with 128MB of RAM and 7GB of fast-wide SCSI drives. Windows NT Server 4.0 was installed on it, as well as Microsoft's beta release news server package. From the client's side, it ran very well, with quick response and lots of storage space. From the server's end it was not so agreeable. The system load was very high all of the time as the system constantly re-indexed the spool. Since the box wasn't serving any other purpose, we let it run. Within the next two weeks, the first drive failed. The second drive failed within two more weeks and we quickly realized this was no longer cost effective for a non-essential service.</p>

  <p>However, we did not want to give up this convenient service, so I proposed that we convert the server into a Linux box, knowing that it would be much more efficient. The only issue was that the NT configuration was using 6GB of disk as a striped volume. I had heard that Linux could support such striping, but none of us had any experience with implementing it. I began research and had a trial system up and running within the day using Red Hat 4.1 and the md driver. The functionality was excellent, and the next day I began the install on the Pentium-Pro.</p>

  <p>After a few days of installation, configuration and customization we had a Linux system that clearly out performed the previous Windows NT configuration. The system load was actually low enough that we could also use the box as an FTP server, a name server and a X client for half a dozen users, moving that load off of the production machines. After two months in operation, we haven't lost a single disk. For us, Linux has proven to be a viable, cost-effective and efficient alternative to the more costly and proprietary commercial operating systems.</p>
