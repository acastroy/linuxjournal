    A practical guide to setting up and using a RAID0 device
    with the multiple device (md) driver.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2abf2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most of us who use Linux at home don't
have the same requirements as businesses that consider Linux a
cost-effective, open alternative to expensive and proprietary
Unices. Usually RAID devices aren't a requirement of the home user,
although many users running a striped swap partition report a big
improvement in speed. The multiple device (md) driver, written by
Marc Zyngier, brings RAID to Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>md</b></span> is a driver (included in
the standard kernel distribution since 1.3.69) that allows you to
group a number of disk partitions together so that they act as a
single block device. <span   class="bold"><b>md</b></span> differs
from the other drivers because it doesn't truly access the physical
devices that compose it. <span   class="bold"><b>md</b></span>
redirects requests from the upper layer to the devices involved and
is interface independent, allowing IDE, SCSI and XT disks to be
grouped as a single device.</p><p>There are three modes that md can use with its devices:
linear, RAID0 and RAID1. In linear mode, the physical devices are
appended to each other. When the first device reaches capacity,
data is sent to the next device in the group. This mode allows for
the creation of a device with a greater capacity but offers no real
improvement in performance. RAID0 (or striped) devices spread the
data evenly across all the devices in the group. Each write is
broken into &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;, and the chunks are placed sequentially
across the physical devices. RAID0 offers performance improvements,
especially with concurrent disk access. RAID1 adds mirroring to
RAID0. I feel that RAID0 is the most important of these modes;
therefore, it is the focus for the remainder of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2abf5b0"></a>Preparation</h2></div></div><p>When planning your RAID0 implementation, there are two
considerations to keep in mind: physical device layout and device
size. If you use partitions on the same physical device, you will
not see any real benefit. The best recommendation I can make is to
use several SCSI disks with each partition having the same number
of blocks. This seems to offer the best performance.
<span   class="bold"><b>md</b></span> can deal with different size
devices as long as there is a significant difference. Using a
1,000,000 block device and a 1,000,001 block device can lead to
problems. If you were to create an md device with a 500MB, a 1000MB
and a 1500MB partition, it would run fine; md would split the
device into &ldquo;stripe zones&rdquo; of 500MB. Once 1500MB was written to
the device, the first physical device would be full. The second
stripe would then be used on the second and third device. After
another 1000MB is written, all data would be placed on the last
device. Performance decreases in this arrangement as disk usage
increases.</p><p>Once you have set up the partitions to be used, the kernel
will have to be recompiled with md support enabled. Run
<b  >make&nbsp;config</b> (<b  >menuconfig</b>
or <b  >xconfig</b>) and select &ldquo;Multiple Device
Support&rdquo; and either &ldquo;Linear&rdquo; or &ldquo;RAID0&rdquo; mode. Compile as
usual. While rebooting with the new kernel, you should receive a
message like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
md driver 0.35 MAX_MD_DEV=4, MAX_REAL=8
raid0 personality registered
</pre><p>If it went by too fast and you think you may have missed it,
use the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dmesg | more
</pre>


to receive a replay of the messages logged at boot time. The
messages show that md version 0.35 is installed with support for up
to four devices, each being made up of up to eight physical devices
with RAID0 support. If you think you either will need more than md0
to md3 or will be using more than eight physical devices in an md,
the md.h file must be edited prior to compilation; it is usually
located in /usr/src/linux/include/linux. Change the value defined
for <b  >MAX_REAL</b> or <b  >MAX_MD_DEV</b> to
fit your requirements.
</p><p>You now have md support in your kernel, or as a loadable
module if you went that way. Next you need to obtain the tools to
manage your md devices. Although md is supported in the kernel, it
appears that most distributions don't include the tools. They are
available from ftp://sweet-smoke.ufr-info-p7.ibp.fr/public/Linux or
from the mirror in the U.S. at
ftp://linux.nrao.edu/pub/linux/packages/MD-driver. Red Hat software
has an RPM distribution available at
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/RPMS. The file md-035-3.i386.rpm
contains the needed binaries. Once you have downloaded and unpacked
the source, become root and run
<b  >make&nbsp;install</b>. The compilation is
straightforward, and I've never had a problem with it. If your
Linux source code tree is not located in /usr/src/linux, you will
need to edit the Makefile; otherwise, it should compile out of the
box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2abfad8"></a>Creating an MD Device</h2></div></div><p>Now you're ready to actually create a RAID0 device. The
compilation created several tools for the task:
<span   class="bold"><b>mdadd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mdrun</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mdstop</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>mdadd</b></span> is used to add block devices
to an md device. If you want to use sda1, sdb1 and sdc1, you issue
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 \
        /dev/sdc1
</pre><p>This command adds sda1, sdb1 and sdc1 to md0. This same
result can also be accomplished by giving these commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sda1
/sbin/mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
/sbin/mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1
</pre>


Remember that the order in which the devices are added is
significant. If you change the order, any data previously written
will be lost. I recommend adding the devices in what seems like a
logical order and then sticking to it.
</p><p>Now we must start the device.
<span   class="bold"><b>mdrun</b></span> has the following command
syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdrun -p
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> indicates the mode:
<b  >-l</b> for linear, <b  >0</b> for RAID0
and <b  >1</b> for RAID1. To start the device we just
made, the command would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdrun -p0 /dev/md0
</pre>


When using RAID devices, another option you can use is
<b  >-c<i><tt>n</tt></i>k</b> to specify chunk
size, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> is the chunk size in KB
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> must be a power of two). For example,
<b  >-c6k</b> indicates a 6KB chunk size. The default
value is the value of your <b  >PAGE_SIZE</b>. The best
value for chunk size would be the average request size, so chances
are two requests will write to different physical disks. If you
plan to use the md for swap space, stick with the default.
</p><p>Once the device is running, you can create a file system and
mount it. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /var/spool/news
</pre><p>This will create an ext2 file system and then mount it as the
news spool. Your RAID0 device is now ready for data. To check its
status, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /proc/mdstat
</pre>


and receive the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Personalities : [2 raid0]
read_ahead 120 sectors
md0 : active raid0 sda1 sdb1 sdc1 168588 blocks 4k chunks
md1 : inactive
md2 : inactive
md3 : inactive
</pre>


This report tells you which modes are supported, the current
read_ahead value, the state of each md device, its mode, physical
parts, total size and chunk size.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c7580.0x2ac0528"></a>Managing Your MD Device</h2></div></div><p>At this point we have our RAID device running and mounted; as
soon as the machine is rebooted, we will have to rerun mdadd, mdrun
and mount. All of this can easily be added to your rc.local file,
but there is a better way.
<span   class="bold"><b>mdcreate</b></span> automatically creates an
/etc/mdtab file. The mdtab file serves a function similar to the
/etc/fstab file, informing the system of the component devices,
modes and mount points. The syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mdcreate [-cxk] mode md_dev dev0 dev1 ...
</pre><p>To create an mdtab file for our example device we would use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdcreate raid0 /dev/md0 /dev/sda1\
        /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
cat /etc/mdtab
# mdtab entry for /dev/md0:
# /dev/md0  raid0,4k,0,fe8a9ffb  /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
</pre>


With this file in place, we can reduce the mdadd command to
<b  >mdadd -a</b> or <b  >mdadd&nbsp;-ar</b> to
automatically add the devices and run them. This also ensures that
the devices will always be added in the correct order.
</p><p>If there is ever a need to stop the device, first unmount it
and then use mdstop. <span   class="bold"><b>mdstop</b></span> will
free the physical devices and flush the buffers. For our example
device, we would first stop the news server if it was running with
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/mdstop /dev/md0
</pre><p>Then, we could unmount it using:
<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /var/spool/news
</pre>


md0 is now inactive, and the physical partitions can be used
elsewhere. Remember, if the device is stopped, none of the data
that was written to the md device is accessible.
</p><p>With md, the implementation and management of RAID devices is
made easy. As development continues, we will see RAID1 and the
tools necessary for mirror management and recovery. To stay current

package. It's tools like this one that are helping Linux find a
place in the business world.
