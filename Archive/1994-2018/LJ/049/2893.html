Quixote</b></span>: Ahhh, Sancho, think of it! A single GUI
interface that would allow me to write my application once and then
run it on Windows, OS2 Warp and Linux boxes without changing one
line! Maybe even on Alpha and Sun boxes too.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: But Master, no one
can agree on anything. Especially the big embarcaderos. And if they
did agree on something like that, it would only be after a hundred
years. Or maybe longer. Then I sleep in the earth. May I rest in
peace.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sancho sometimes transmogrifies
vocables when he speaks. It is not clear exactly what he means by
&ldquo;embarcaderos&rdquo;. The meaning probably lies somewhere within the
semantic turf demarcated by the concepts &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo;, &ldquo;big
guys in business&rdquo;, &ldquo;movers and shakers&rdquo;, or the concept of your
choice that denotes mercantile power, grandeur and a touch of
narcissism.</em></span>]</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Have you
forgotten the great examples of cooperation? The ones that made
computing easier? What about the LIM memory specification? Three
giants&mdash;your embarcaderos&mdash;created one method of accessing memory
above one megabyte so that programs could be bigger, faster.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Careful, Master. One
of the last giants was a windmill.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Sancho, it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> a giant. And remember: I am your
master.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: But Master, just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> example. Once is an exception. Proves
nada! Twice is a coincidence. Also proves nada. Three times is a
pattern. Give a second example!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: You doubter!
You miss the best in life because you look down, not up. You
overlook great things to discover only the pebbles in your own
shoes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Please, Master, the
example. A poor man like me does not go far on words and ideas.
Please, something concrete!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Sancho, Sancho!
What about STL, the standard template library? Now we all have
containers that can be used with almost any ANSI compiler! We
cooperated on that! What about the committee that drafted standards
for C++? Knights from all over the industry came together. These
are great achievements.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: All right, Master!
STL and ANSI standards are both C++. You get credit for one example
only. Nothing more. That's number two. So now you have a
coincidence.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Have I made my
point?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: No!! You give three
good examples, or I believe in nothing! Nada! Nada!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Sancho, Sancho,
so pedestrian, so little imagination. I fear for your
salvation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Master, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span>, please!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Think of Java.
Here we have something like the ideal I am thinking of. We write
once, we run many. Why? Java is interpreted code. And the
interpreter is written for the platform. The application is written
for the interpreter. So we run on all platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Oh, Master! If Java
is interpreted, Java is slower! Slower is not good. Faster is
good.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Exactly! For
once you have something right. We need performance
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> portability.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: But Master! Where is
the cooperation? Sun Microsystems created Java.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: You miss the
point. Sun did cooperate. They licensed Java to anyone who agreed
not to provincialize the language by creating non-portable, local
extensions. Most people respected this agreement. Java was not
theirs to take over anyway. So Java is portable, mainly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Master, Master! What
is this ahead?</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sancho and Don Quixote have just
reached the crest of a hill, and looking down the other side, they
spy a bridge over a small brook. Next to it stands a sign: &ldquo;Bridge
to Cross&rdquo;. Just as they approach the crossing, a Proprietary Troll
jumps up from below the bridge onto the road, barring their
way.</em></span>]</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>: I control
this bridge, and you must pay toll, or you may not cross.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Sir, I am a
Knight, champion of Dulcinea del Toboso and future keeper of the
universal GUI interface. Let us pass, sir!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>: I control
this bridge, and you must pay toll. Heed my words, or you will fare
badly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Indeed! What
will I lose?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>: Market
Share, my Knight, market share!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>:
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>suddenly thoughtful</em></span>] I see. And what toll do
you desire?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>:
Control!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Of what? You
mean the GUI interface? You want to control that too?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>: That most
of all. That is your toll. Give it up, turn it over to me, or you
will not pass. I control the bridge, I control the interface and I
control you.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Not so fast,
you runt!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Master, Master! You
forget yourself!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: You forget your
bridge is just one miserable, narrow crossing, that your brook is
just a tributary of one great, massive stream whose power sweeps us
all along, that you can simply be washed away if you fail to meet
the needs of travelers who come this way. You overreach yourself!
Say, aren't you a little far from Scandinavia?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Proprietary Troll</b></span>:
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>puffing himself up and then expelling a lot of hot
air</em></span>] Try to cross without my help. Lose market share. We
will see who is swept away!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Canis culum in
tuo naso! We will find another bridge and cross elsewhere. We do
not need you to provide a crossing. If need be, we build a bridge
of our own.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Canis culum in tuo naso&rdquo; is a Latin
curse which first occurs in writing in the Old High German period
(ca. 850-1050) in a phrase book for travelers which gives Latin
phrases and their German equivalents. The Old High German
equivalent is: &ldquo;hundes ars in dine nas&rdquo;.</em></span>]</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: [<span   class="emphasis"><em>to
himself</em></span>] Such nonsense! For windmills he sees giants.
Trolls bigger than life. Oh, Lord, give me something small again, a
pebble for my shoe!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Sancho, forget
your pebbles! Let us hie ourselves hence and find another
crossing.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sancho and the Don turn about to find
a crossing on another tributary of the great stream. Their thoughts
return to the interface.</em></span>]</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: OK, you gave three
examples. Tell me more about your universal gooey face.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>:
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>grimaces at Sancho</em></span>] Sancho, if I am no longer
your master, how will you fill your belly? I said Universal GUI
interface, not gooey face. Sometimes I don't think you take me
seriously.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Sorry, Master! Tell
me more about your gooey inter...face.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: That's better.
First, the universal GUI interface should be a standard that
remains the same from platform to platform just like STL or ANSI
C++. The details of the implementation should be hidden from the
client because they're platform dependent. This interface means
that ideally programs can run on multiple platforms without
change.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: What is the gooey
interface supposed to do?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: That's easy.
The interface should provide a complete set of tools which perform
routine window management tasks and offer all the functionality of
the provincial GUI interfaces already in place. These tools should
be general enough to be very flexible but powerful enough to
compete head-on with the provincial GUI interfaces out there and
provide programmers with a serious opportunity to write portable
code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Great. But what
language will you write this in? Spanish? Portuguese?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: C++ of course!
It is object-oriented, supports inheritance, and the details of the
implementation can easily be hidden from clients. It is also fast
and allows access to the hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Can you be more
specific? What procedures will your universal gooey interface
include to manage a window?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: The details are
best left to the Knights who convene to create the interface. All
they need to do is decide what functionality the interface should
include and then examine the provincial interfaces already in place
to see if implementing that functionality is practical.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Has anyone ever
tried to write a universal gooey interface?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Not that I know
of. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>Suddenly the Don is full of himself.</em></span>] But
there is rustling in the woods, voices from under the earth,
whisperings in the breeze. A new age may be at hand. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Don thumps his chest triumphantly as though the battle were already
won.</em></span>]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: [<span   class="emphasis"><em>To
himself</em></span>] What nonsense! [<span   class="emphasis"><em>To the
Don</em></span>] What do you mean? Your words are
confused....uhhh...excuse, Sire, I mean confusing. Can you give an
example?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: No one has
tried to write what I speak of exactly but there are movements in
that direction. The X Window System has been ported from Linux to
OS/2 so that an OS/2 machine can be hooked to a Linux network and
run its software. Also, a Windows emulator is being developed for
Linux so that Windows applications will run inside Linux even
though Linux is not a genuine Windows platform. Finally,
programmers in Allemagne have created a conio.h and conio.c
implementation that mimics the conio.h and conio.c files in Borland
and Watcom C so that PC-DOS programs port more easily to Linux. And
there is a PC-DOS emulator for Linux too. These achievements all
attempt to allow someone to run a program on a platform it was not
written for without changing code, and their common goal is
portability.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: Do you think the
knights will be able to do such a thing as the gooey face at
all?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: I don't know,
but I hope so.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sancho</b></span>: What stops
them?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Quixote</b></span>: Just a little
cooperation.</p></div></div>
