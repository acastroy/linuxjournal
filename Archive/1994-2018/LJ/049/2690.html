    Mr. Kominek introduces us to the Modula-3 language and shows
    us how it can be used for cross-platform programming.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x17403a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back when Borland introduced Turbo Pascal
1.0, Philip Khan did something shrewd: he included the source code
for a simple spreadsheet, which is why many programmers bought the
product. At a time when Lotus 1-2-3 was <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>
killer application, nothing was more enticing than a glimpse of its
key data structure&mdash;the sparse matrix.
</p><p>Of course, the spreadsheet is no longer leading edge. So what
might its updated version be? Judging by recent market fanfare, I'd
say a spreadsheet that is distributed, multi-platform and
web-aware. How would you go about building one?</p><p>Delphi, the most recent incarnation of Pascal, is not a bad
choice&mdash;provided you can live within Windows alone. For us,
however, Linux compatibility is a must. You could try to master the
intricacies of CORBA, but that standard is now engaged in a turf
war with Microsoft's DCOM, a creature of even more convoluted
behavior. However, there is another choice available to the Linux
programmer.</p><p>The Modula-3 language and its surrounding system offer a
simple, clean, mature and robust tool for writing distributed
applications. (See the sidebar <a href="2690s1.html" target="_self">&ldquo;A Brief
Biography&rdquo;</a>.) In this article I'll highlight the steps
necessary for building a distributed spreadsheet. My goal is not to
provide a full-fledged product, but rather a framework of code that
illustrates all the key components.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1740660"></a>A Distributed Application Framework</h2></div></div><p>There are three senses in which a piece of software can be
considered &ldquo;distributed&rdquo;.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The data and computation can be divided into
separate processes. In particular, the data can be viewed from
multiple clients (GUI viewers), even though it is stored
elsewhere.</p></li><li><p>The executables can reside on separate
machines&mdash;for instance, a pair of Linux servers supporting some
mixture of Windows and Linux clients.</p></li><li><p>The work can be distributed between people. You and
I may be collaborating remotely on the same spreadsheet, with
precautions taken to ensure that I don't overwrite your entries by
mistake.</p></li></ol></div><p>Compared to traditional applications, distributed software is
harder to design and get right. In spite of this, it allows for
growth and flexible organization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1740a28"></a>Software Ingredients</h2></div></div><p>Three basic ingredients are required by our task:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>A spreadsheet
object</b></span>: Initially, it is enough to use a two-dimensional
array. Once our application is up and running, experience will help
refine the object's interface. Later, the fixed array can be
replaced with a sparse matrix.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>A display widget</b></span>:
Having the user interface separate from the data eases
modifications and simplifies the task of cross-platform
deployment.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Connecting glue</b></span>:
The spreadsheet object and display widget need to be able to talk
to each other.</p></li></ol></div><p>In Modula-3, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Objects</em></span> provide the
connecting glue. The beauty is that as far as your code is
concerned, invoking an object somewhere on the Net is nearly as
easy as one inside your own program. Most of the hard work is done
for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1740f50"></a>About Modula-3</h2></div></div><p>As a modern, general purpose systems programming language,
Modula-3 is lean in design, yet practical and powerful.
Applications range from the fun things (multiuser games), to the
serious (operating systems), to the deadly serious (911 call
centers). Ten years of use has made the reference compiler solid
and dependable.</p><p>Current implementations exist for Win32 and popular
incarnations of Unix. The Linux port, in particular, receives
constant attention. Several versions are available for download,
including the full source tree. (For pointers, see the sidebar
<a href="2690s2.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Modula-3 Resources&rdquo;</a>).</p><p>Beyond openness, the language has numerous features to
recommend it, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A clean, Algol-derived syntax</p></li><li><p>Explicit support for modules and interfaces</p></li><li><p>A mechanism for calling external C code and
libraries</p></li><li><p>Both traditional and object types (with single
inheritance)</p></li><li><p>Built-in threads and mutexes for multi-threaded
programming</p></li><li><p>Assertions and exceptions to support error
handling</p></li><li><p>An incremental garbage collector to simplify memory
usage</p></li></ul></div><p>If this reminds you of Java, that's no accident. Though the
syntax of Java is derived from C++, many key improvements descend
directly from Modula-3. One implementation of Modula-3 even allows
mix-and-match integration with Java.</p><p>Features located in &ldquo;the first ring out&rdquo;, though not
defined in the language itself, include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Quake, a simplified build language that replaces
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span></p></li><li><p>Standard libraries of algorithms and container
objects</p></li><li><p>A lightweight database component</p></li><li><p>A multi-platform windowing system with user
interface toolkit</p></li><li><p>Network objects</p></li></ul></div><p>Network objects allow us to proceed in stages. First, a
spreadsheet can be constructed as a single executable. Next, as
multiple processes running on one machine. Finally, as multiple
processes running over multiple machines. The jumps between stages
are small.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1741bb0"></a>Step 1: Basic Construction</h2></div></div><p>We need some underlying data structure for our spreadsheet,
so let's begin simply by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TYPE
  Grid: REF ARRAY OF ARRAY OF INTEGER;
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
TYPE
  Grid: REF ARRAY OF ARRAY OF Money.T;
</pre>


This defines a two dimensional grid of integers (in the first
line), or, as a second option, of type <b  >Money.T</b>.
Integers are a built-in type. <b  >Money.T</b> is a
programmer-defined type; the &ldquo;.T&rdquo; suffix is a Modula-3
convention. (In a real spreadsheet, each column would have a
distinct user-defined type. Let that detail pass for now.)
</p><p>A new grid can be allocated on the heap during variable
declarations, if you wish, or during program execution.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
VAR
  myGrid : Grid := NEW (Grid, rows, cols);
BEGIN
  myGrid := NEW (Grid, 100, 20);
END.
</pre><p>The second assignment of myGrid will wipe out the first, but
don't be alarmed&mdash;we do not have a memory leak. The Modula-3
garbage collector takes care of reclaiming lost memory. This is
also true of object variables (no destructors necessary), including
objects that allocate memory on remote machines.
</p><p>To flesh out our spreadsheet object, we next attach some
operator methods to the grid. A good place for this is in a
separate &ldquo;interface&rdquo; file. <a href="2690l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a> contains an initial cut at spreadsheet.i3. Our object is
now declared to be a Spreadsheet.T type.</p><p>The important property of an <span   class="emphasis"><em>interface</em></span>
is that it contains no executable code whatsoever. That's reserved
for &ldquo;.m3&rdquo; or module files. The interface does not say how
something is computed, merely what it does. This is similar to .h
files in C, but is more strict. Only the operations explicitly
exposed in an interface&mdash;or &ldquo;exported&rdquo; to use the jargon&mdash;are
available for outside use.</p><p>(The sharp reader may have noticed that the representation of
Grid is exposed in spreadsheet.i3&mdash;a bad thing. Modula-3 does allow
you to hide details of representation inside implementation files.
That would take us into a discussion of opaque types, however, a
more advanced topic.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x17389c0"></a>Step 2: User Interface Design</h2></div></div><p>Modula-3 comes with a multi-platform windowing system called
Trestle. Built upon Trestle is a user interface toolkit called
VBTkit, and a UI builder, FormsVBT. You may call X directly if you
wish (alternatively, the Win32 GDI), but in doing so you lose
portability.</p><p>A description of your program's user interface is called a
&ldquo;Trestle Form&rdquo;. A form is a textual description of names and
values, organized using nested parentheses. Form elements consist
of windows, frames, buttons and so on, as well as properties such
as color. <a href="2690l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is a sample
form for a popup calculator, as shown in Figure 1.</p><p>The important point is that a form is defined in its own
file, outside any Modula-3 code. This separation of concerns proves
valuable when the user interface designer is a different person
from the primary coder. The form does not describe how to construct
the interface, merely what it looks like. The FormsVBT library
builds it at run time and hooks it into your code.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2690f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1738d88"></a>Step 3: Building the Program</h2></div></div><p>Suppose our spreadsheet is implemented, along with a suite of
test functions. To build a program, we must inform the compiler
what source files comprise our executable. This is done in a
Modula-3 make file, or <span   class="bold"><b>m3makefile</b></span>.
An example is shown in <a href="2690l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3</a>.</p><p>To build your program, at the command-line prompt
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m3build
</pre><p>The compiler will determine dependency relations for you,
recompiling only what is necessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1739048"></a>Step 4: Objects to Network Objects</h2></div></div><p>Converting a regular object (restricted to a single address
space) to a network object (visible over the Net) is not as
difficult as you might imagine. You must attend to four
details.</p><p>First, the network object library needs to be linked in. This
is performed in the m3makefile (Listing 3).</p><p>Second, make the following two changes to the spreadsheet
interface:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IMPORT Money;
IMPORT NetObj;  (* new statement *)
  TYPE
    T = NetObj.T OBJECT  (* modified line *)
      grid: Grid;
      name: TEXT;
    METHODS
      ...
</pre><p>Third, and this matters only at execution time, a network
object daemon needs to be running in the background. The program is
supplied as part of Modula-3. Start the daemon by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
netobjd &amp;
</pre>


In a client-server architecture, the spreadsheet object resides
with the server, yet it is the client that issues method calls (to
update a cell, for example). Clients need to find out about each
other. This is the fourth detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1739308"></a>Step 5: Distributed Deployment</h2></div></div><p>The netobj daemon acts like a bulletin board. First, the
server posts a note saying, &ldquo;I've got a spreadsheet object for
sale.&rdquo; Then the client comes along and says, &ldquo;I'll buy that.&rdquo;
The server exports; the client imports; the daemon mediates. In the
nomenclature of CORBA, the daemon is an object request broker. Once
the sale is complete, the client and server talk to each other
directly. Code details are found in
<a href="2690l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>.</p><p>Listing 4 will work when the server and client are located on
the same machine. Suppose instead that the server runs on some
Linux box&mdash;eggnog.cmu.edu&mdash;and that the clients are elsewhere.
Ensure that netobjd is running on eggnog and change one line in the
client program.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
address := NetObj.Locate( "eggnog.cmu.edu" );
</pre><p>With that, our programs now talk over the Net.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1739570"></a>Step 6: Cell Range Locking</h2></div></div><p>Because Modula-3 comes ready-made with thread support, it
also provides mutexes (mutual exclusion semaphores) so that
parallel operations on the same datum are serialized. In our
discussion so far, the Money.T type has been left unspecified. It
might actually be something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INTERFACE Money;
TYPE
  T = MUTEX OBJECT
    cents: INTEGER;
  END;
END Money.
</pre><p>Mutexes protect data so that client B does not modify values
before client A is finished. Granted, protecting each cell
separately is overkill. A more elegant approach is to protect
ranges of cells, with the lock initiated by user action.
</p><p>Figure 2 shows a spreadsheet from the point of view of user A
(Alice). She is working on the cell range tinted red. User B (Bob)
cannot modify these cells. He is working on the blue cells,
indicating to Alice that to her they are read only.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2690f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Simple Multiuser Spreadsheet
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1739938"></a>Step 7: Porting Procedure</h2></div></div><p>To port our user interface program from Linux to Windows NT,
do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Archive the client source code by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> command.</p></li><li><p>Copy the tar file to your Windows machine.</p></li><li><p>Unarchive the file using tar. Convert end-of-line
markers.</p></li><li><p>At the command line, type
<b  >m3build</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Assuming there are no stunts of low-level programming, all
the Modula-3 code in this example&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>including the
GUI</em></span>&mdash;is transparently portable. Differing path name
conventions, for example, are hidden behind OS-independent
interfaces. There's not an <b  >#ifdef</b> in
sight.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1648580.0x1739f10"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In this article I've highlighted the creation of a
multi-platform, distributed spreadsheet using Modula-3. The key
step is to wrap the spreadsheet into a network object. In this way,
remote objects may be invoked with exactly the same syntax as local
objects. Most of the hard work is done for you.</p><p>Modula-3 is not the only means for creating distributed
applications, but in my mind it strikes an optimal balance between
simplicity and power. By its very intent, it is a language for
building large, solid systems in order for you to get your work
done.</p><p>Clearly, my discussion has omitted many details. To help fill
this gap, a companion tutorial is available on the Web (see the
sidebar <a href="2690s3.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo;</a>.) Full
source code is available for experimentation and invention.</p></div></div>
