    As part of Eric's article, he introduced a new phrase for
    talking about software such as Netscape Navigator as well as other software where the
    source code is freely available. The phrase is Open Source.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1825580.0x191d240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we published an article by
Eric Raymond on Netscape's decision to release the source code for
their web browser. A lot has happened since Eric's article, and
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> is what I wish to talk about this
month.
</p><p>As part of Eric's article, he introduced a new phrase for
talking about software such as Netscape Navigator as well as other
software where the source code is freely available. The phrase is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Source</em></span>.</p><p>The idea for a new name and the choice of that name has been
an ongoing debate and, at this writing, continues. The confusion is
associated with the term <span   class="emphasis"><em>Free Software</em></span>. Free
has many different meanings. In particular, free can refer to price
or to freedom. While freedom is the issue that we are attempting to
address, there has continued to be confusion.</p><p>Rather than attempting to define what we mean by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>, the introduction of a new term seemed in
order. With the new term comes the opportunity to define it.</p><p>Bruce Perens (of Software in the Public Interest) and I
decided that a web site with a repository of information on Open
Source was the best approach. That web site is at
http://www.opensource.org/ and includes the definition of Open
Source and extensive resources to get others on the Open Source
bandwagon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1825580.0x191d608"></a>Netscape Update</h2></div></div><p>By the time you read this magazine, the source code for
Netscape Communicator 5.0 Standard Edition should be available.
Netscape announced they would release this code on March 31,
1998.</p><p>Netscape released a preliminary version of their license
agreement (Netscape Public License) for public comment. That
comment period ran through March 11.</p><p>Netscape put the proposed license on the Web along with a FAQ
and annotations. The ongoing saga of this license is available on
the Web at http://www.mozilla.org/. I'm not a lawyer but what I see
of the license makes sense. It isn't a GPL and it isn't a BSD
license, but that is because neither makes sense for
Netscape.</p><p>One thing in the license I found interesting is they have
elected to keep the name Netscape for branded products and allow
the use of Mozilla for derived works. This makes sense to me. When
I was talking to Eric Raymond before he met with Netscape, I
brought up the concern that a bad port or modification of a
Netscape product could reflect poorly on all Netscape products. The
decision to use a different name offers the needed freedom, yet
allows the consumer to differentiate between a Netscape product and
a derived product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1825580.0x191d818"></a>Other Players</h2></div></div><p>Netscape is not the only commercial vendor in the Open Source
camp; there are others.</p><p>One hardware vendor who got into this camp before it even
existed is Cyclades. Cyclades was the first communications board
manufacturer to embrace Linux. They have always made the source
code available for their drivers and their sales growth in the
Linux and BSD markets has supported their decision to release
source code for their drivers.</p><p>Another long-term vendor in this community is Cygnus
Solutions. They offer commercial support for open source software
and continue to grow and evolve with the community.</p><p>Of course, all the Linux vendors are there by default as well
as the Apache web server and the Perl programming language. Vendors
who elect to get involved with these products become part of the
Open source vendor base.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1825580.0x191da28"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>I have already mentioned the Open Source and Mozilla web
sites. As always, we put late-breaking Linux news up on the Linux
Resources web site, http://www.linuxresources.com/.</p><p><a href="2727s1.html" target="_self">1998 Open Systems Products
