The Transformer Prime is a killer piece of hardware, no doubt...but can it
replace a full-fledged Linux Netbook?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x203d250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The original Transformer was a unique concept put forth by ASUS in an
effort to gain ground against the then-ubiquitous iPad. With its
attachable keyboard, the tablet gained a fair amount of attention and
performed well sales-wise to boot. But, although it had a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor with
its keyboard accessory, some felt it lacked the build quality and style
of its competition. So, ASUS went back to the drawing board, and the
sequel device has all the advantages of the original with its detachable
keyboard. It's wrapped in a thinner, lighter, better-looking case that's
every bit as stylish as anything else on the market, and it adds kick-butt
performance to boot.

Device Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The specs of the tablet portion of the Prime are, in most ways, common
to a number of other devices on the market, including the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

viewing angle).
</p></li><li><p>
Power: 25Wh Li-polymer battery (est. 12-hour life).
</p></li><li><p>
Controls: power switch and volume rocker control.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
Connecting to the keyboard adds the additional features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Size/weight: 263 x 180.8 x 810.4mm; 537g.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Multitouch touchpad/button (one-button).
</p></li><li><p>
Full-size USB port.
</p></li><li><p>
SD card slot.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
40-pin female proprietary connector (for charging the tablet and
keyboard).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The main thing setting the Prime apart is its processor: the 1.2GHz
Tegra 3&mdash;a Quad-core processor that impressed the tech media when NVIDIA
first demonstrated it. The Prime has been the only mainstream tablet to
feature this chip, and it provides the Prime with a nice boost under the
hood.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x203e328"></a>
Device Introduction and First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>
Before even cutting the plastic wrap on the Prime's box, one thing you
notice is how svelte even its packaging is. The box also is blissfully
uncluttered within, as the only things it contains are the tablet
itself, a quick-start guide, the warranty form, a screen-cleaner cloth,
and the power cable and plug block. You notice at once when you lift the
tablet out of the box how solid it feels, to the point where it almost
feels heavier than it is. The casing, which features the same circular
brushed-aluminum design with more-recent ASUS ultrabooks and other
machines, feels smooth. There is a little flex to the tablet's casing,
but only if you squeeze it harder than most people are likely to do.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11242f2.large.jpg"><img src="11242f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. When you look this good, you don't need a lot of packaging.
</p></div></div><p>
Although the initial boot of the Prime puts you into a fairly stock version
of Android 3.2 (Honeycomb), ASUS thankfully has not gone the route of
heavy customizations to the interface. But, due to the arrival date of my
device, I spent so little time with it, it was difficult to give the software
platform a thorough walk-through. I received the tablet on a Thursday,
and it was upgraded to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) the following
Wednesday. This review focuses on that version of the operating
system, as anyone purchasing a new Prime will be upgraded in short
order.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11242f3.large.jpg"><img src="11242f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. One of the Prime's live wallpapers&mdash;it spins so smoothly it'll make
you dizzy.
</p></div></div><p>
As you start to use the Prime, you'll notice its responsiveness.
Swiping through screens is pleasantly smooth, and apps pop open with
little hesitation. If you own another Android device, you also may be
surprised to see any apps you've installed begin showing up on the Prime
as well. This is a nice touch, as I have more than 60 apps on my Motorola
Droid, and after a few moments, I had them on my Prime too. ASUS
preloaded a few of its own apps too, including ones to handle file
management, media and cloud storage, although with my old, familiar
apps installed automatically, I haven't used them much.
</p><p>
I spent a fun week or so with the tablet on its own, during which time I got
all the justification I needed for my purchase. Having used an iPad I
received at work for a brief period, I did gain an appreciation for the
form factor, which was perfect for media consumption. Google Reader
isn't quite so easy or pleasant to use on either of my previous two main
devices (the aforementioned Droid and an MSI Wind Netbook). And forget
about video&mdash;although I had watched YouTube videos or shows on Netflix on
the Droid, but not on my Kubuntu-powered Netbook (more on this in the
Transformer Prime vs. a Netbook sidebar), it paled in comparison to the nice, bright, crisp screen of
the Prime. The first few weeks with the Prime highlighted a number of
this device's other strengths.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x203e900"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Transformer Prime vs. a Netbook</b></p><p>
For the bulk of this review, I tried to remain objective in assessing
the Prime's capability as a tablet&mdash;that is, how it stacks up to other
tablets and people's expectation of tablets. Although the Prime certainly
excels in these areas, one goal I had in mind when I purchased this was
how it would serve as a replacement to my faithful yet aging MSI Wind
Netbook. In some cases, the Prime trounces the Wind quite frankly, but
there are some areas in which the Netbook is still king.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Daily busy work:</b></span> I refer here to the little things that people do every
day&mdash;move some files around, install programs and so on. And as a stalwart
KDE user, in my opinion, doing these things in a full desktop OS still
is miles beyond what you need to go through sometimes on Android just to
cut and paste a file from one folder to another.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Simple Internet tasks:</b></span> in this area, it's Prime all the way. My Kubuntu
Netbook takes so long to get to a desktop at this point (it's
almost always powered off, because it's so old the battery is shot, and
it often will run out of power when in suspend) that if I'm just looking to
do a quick Web search of some kind, I'm done on the Prime before I'd
even be able to start on the Wind. Because I use Gmail as well, it's
easy-peasy on Android.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Simple productivity tasks:</b></span> once again, Prime all day long. If I need to
jot down some notes at a meeting, Evernote, Supernote (an app ASUS
includes with the device), or a simple text editor does the trick. And
I'd consider Polaris capable of doing spreadsheets as well as drafting
text documents, although I'd want to open them in a real word processor
before I'd send them to anyone.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Multimedia:</b></span> this is a tough call, as both are perfectly capable of
playing most types of file-based media. But I have to give the Prime the
edge here, because 1) Android supports more streaming and other
Internet-based media services, and 2) the Prime is so light, it's with me
all the time. Pulling out a tablet to listen to some music while
enjoying a latte is a little more convenient in many cases than
booting up a Netbook.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Complex productivity tasks:</b></span> as mentioned
earlier, the lack of hard-core
business apps for Android is the main problem here, and so the Wind has
to take this category. There's nothing that comes close to opening up a
document in LibreOffice on Android at the moment. And although I also
haven't had the chance to tinker with some code on the Prime, I have
seen the text editors available, and as a beginner programmer, I can see
them not holding my hand through Java inner classes as well as Eclipse
does.
</p><p>
So for my purposes (which may be different from yours), I'm mostly
satisfied with the Prime as a replacement to the MSI Wind, although I
certainly feel the lack of LibreOffice at times. But I haven't carried
the Wind out of the house since I got the Prime, so it must be doing a
pretty good job so far.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x2437128"></a>
The Good</h2></div></div><p>
When considering the tablet half of the Prime, reading and watching
video are really the activities that make you appreciate it. The ability
to have two panes on-screen in something like Google Reader or Gmail
felt like a huge upgrade from the tap-item-list-view-back-to-previous
that's so common on smartphones. Video playback that didn't skip and
that also didn't have to sit three inches from my face in order to see
everything was just gravy. Within these activities, a few specific
examples stand out:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11242f4.large.jpg"><img src="11242f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. In the Gmail Spam folder view&mdash;no spam here, hooray!
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Reading mail in Gmail: Gmail is a good, you might even say great,
mail client (for Gmail, anyway) on a smartphone, but handling mail
on the Prime is just better. The aforementioned panes make buzzing
through a long list of messages and dealing with the important ones
a breeze, and having the omnipresent list of labels to your left
lets you jump back and forth between them as needed. The experience
in other mail clients (including the stock Mail app that ships with
Android as well as K9 Mail, which I use for my IMAP account at work)
isn't as productive, in large part because neither of these apps
seem to have been &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; for tablets.
</p></li><li><p>
Reading documents, such as PDFs and e-books: I've always considered
reading on a phone to be a convenience thing&mdash;I have a few minutes,
so I open something in a PDF or e-book reader on the phone while I
can. Not so with the Prime. Although reading for long stretches
requires resting the eyes every so often, I've already gone
through more than one full-length book on the Prime, as well as
other PDFs and lots of Web-based documentation. I'm not saying that
a secondary device with a nice, soft E Ink screen wouldn't be nice,
but I'm not rushing out to buy one either.
</p></li><li><p>
Watching video on Netflix: I do have Netflix installed on my phone,
but as Joe Piscopo would have said in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Johnny Dangerously</em></span>,
&ldquo;I watched
Netflix on my phone once. Once!&rdquo; Grainy. Jumpy. Over Wi-Fi, it played
all right, but given an extra few minutes, I'd probably spend them
reading a book rather than trying to watch any video that wasn't a
30-second YouTube clip. But, Netflix on the Prime is smooth and
sharp.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The experience with the tablet portion of the Prime on its own is quite
good, and the polish Ice Cream Sandwich brings to the tablet form factor
is readily apparent. Swiping through multiple apps; clicking on common
links, such as e-mail addresses (which presents an option to open with
Gmail or Mail, if the latter is configured), URLs (which open the
Browser by default) and addresses (which open Google Maps); and opening
common file types (which open the appropriate app or apps) all work as
expected. I was able to multitask easily, and with the help of some
must-have apps like Google Reader, GTasks, Evernote and Epistle (which
were installed following my first boot, as mentioned above), I was
putting together draft blog posts in no time. In this regard, actually
creating content was a productive enough exercise, which is to say it
was no easier or more difficult than on any other tablet.
</p><p>
That is, until my next delivery a week or so later. This is the best
part of the Transformer experience: the keyboard dock. After removing
the keyboard from its minimal packaging, I popped the Prime into the
slot at the top, and following a firmware update, I was happily
tippity-tapping away in about five seconds. It was that easy. I never
tried hooking up the original Transformer to its keyboard, but I've read
some complaints about the mechanism. I can report that the tablet clicks
smoothly into place, and there is no hint of flimsiness or difficulty
getting it to slot together with the keyboard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11242f5.large.jpg"><img src="11242f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The missing link&mdash;the Prime's keyboard dock.
</p></div></div><p>
You can't imagine how much more useful the two pieces become until you
have them both. I tend to spend time flipping through Web pages
or RSS feeds with the tablet alone. But if I have an idea for, well,
anything, I can have it captured before it evaporates (which happens
faster and faster these days). The keyboard is every bit as usable for
longer typing sessions as the Netbook this tablet-combo is meant to
replace. Although I haven't had the opportunity to try any other tablets
with any other types of keyboards (such as Bluetooth models to pair with
the iPad or Galaxy Tab, both of which I've spent some time using), I
can't imagine any of them are as convenient and easy to use as the Prime
and its keyboard dock. Highlights of the tablet/keyboard combination
include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The additional battery life, which really does make for all-day
usage.
</p></li><li><p>
The trackpad and full-size USB port (if you have one of those mini-mice with
the retractable cords, just plug it in, and it works).
</p></li><li><p>
A row of dedicated, incredibly useful shortcut keys in place of the
usual &ldquo;Function&rdquo; keys. Until recently, I'd actually taken the steps
of going to Settings, switching to the Wireless &amp; Networks screen,
then turning the radio off. This is, of course, also done with a
quick tap of the F1 key.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The keyboard does add a lot to the tablet experience, but it also
highlights some shortcomings as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x2437d88"></a>
The Bad</h2></div></div><p>
The keyboard is a huge benefit, and the experience using it with OS
functions and many of the built-in apps is really tight. But, support of
the keyboard by some other apps isn't quite so good. For example, the
stock Android Browser app responds to many of the keyboard shortcuts
you'd expect (Ctrl-T for a new tab, Ctrl-W to close current tab,
Ctrl-Left to go back and so on). But some other apps don't support them at
all, requiring significant trackpad usage. This doesn't sound like a
lot, but after one evening of replacing images on a Joomla site using
only the built-in Browser (which, as correctly pointed out by many early
reviews of the Prime, is no speed demon) and the Astro file manager, I
can tell you that performing the same task on a desktop would have taken
one-tenth the time (no exaggeration, I did the math when I finished it
at work the next day). Worse are some of the apps that support keyboard
shortcuts, but only inconsistently. For example, in the Gmail app,
pressing the C key will open a new mail (Compose, I imagine, an
uncommon choice but I've seen it), but no combination of other keys with
the letter R will allow you to Reply.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11242f6.large.jpg"><img src="11242f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. In Browser, opening these tabs via the keyboard was nearly
instantaneous. Not so with other apps.
</p></div></div><p>
And just as the keyboard support is at the moment somewhat half-baked,
the availability of apps in the Market optimized for tablets is still
behind the curve. Although an icon in the notification bar will tell you
if you're using a smartphone app that's &ldquo;scaled-up&rdquo; for use on bigger
screens, you don't really need it&mdash;it's painfully obvious. Take the
Facebook app for instance, in which nearly the entire right side of the
app is empty space when in landscape orientation, or one of my
favorites, ConnectBot, which refuses to sit in landscape orientation
unless the keyboard is attached. Some of these apps just need a bit of
thought given to typical tablet use cases, but for the time being, there
are enough idiosyncrasies that it warrants more than just a shrug and a
&ldquo;meh&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Last, and least, for the time being, is that as someone who's doing the
business/document thing during the day, the pre-installed Polaris office
just doesn't hold up to most documents. It's fine for jotting down
meeting notes or doing a quick spreadsheet to sum up some numbers, and the
Google Docs integration is pretty neat. But for anything that involves
heavy formatting, what you open is not going to look like what was sent
to you, and what you send won't look like what the person you sent it to
opens. Hopefully, the upcoming LibreOffice port
(<a href="http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2012-02-04.html" target="_self">people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2012-02-04.html</a>)
will give Android tablets, and especially a business-savvy model like
the Prime, something to combat the likes of iWork on the iPad (which is
a great example of what a slimmed-down office package can be).
</p><p>
Other minor nags include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The camera is okay&mdash;not great, not bad, but just okay.
</p></li><li><p>
The little rubber doors that are all over the ports, with the
exception of where the keyboard links up, which comes with a neat
plastic dummy-card-looking thing I can't believe I haven't lost yet.
</p></li><li><p>
I will mention for those who dislike this sort of thing that it is
something of a fingerprint magnet. I'll also immediately qualify
this by saying I hate when reviews point this out. It's a tablet.
You use it with your hands, and your hands have fingers on them.
It's going to get fingerprints on it. Luckily, they include a
cleaning cloth with the tablet that's great at removing them.
</p></li><li><p>
I find the speaker, despite some other reviews to the contrary, to
be a little weak, especially when hooked up to the keyboard. But I
so rarely rely on this speaker that it's not a problem for me.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f45580.0x2438570"></a>
The Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As someone who entered the mobile development field last year, I still
held out for more than six months before spending some cheddar on this
device. Now that I've done so, I have a hard time picturing what it
would be like to go back. If I could get a full-blown,
reasonably performing Linux build on this machine, it would make me
think closely about whether I actually need a real notebook. But as it is,
the ASUS Transformer Prime is certainly best in class among Android
tablets currently on the market: a cutting-edge processor, the latest-and-greatest Android OS and the flexibility to go from a
content-devouring media device to a quick-switching productivity machine
(even if the lack of strong apps means you're working in plain text),
all in a solid, stylish package. At approximately $650 for the whole
kit, it's not the cheapest machine on the block, but I certainly
consider it worth the price.
