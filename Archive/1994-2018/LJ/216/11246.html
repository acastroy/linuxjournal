If your server has high load when no sysadmin is logged in, use
sar to find out what happened.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed33b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As someone who's been working as a system administrator for a number of
years, it's easy to take tools for granted that I've used for a long time and
assume everyone has heard of them. Of course, new sysadmins get into the
field every day, and even seasoned sysadmins don't all use the same tools.
With that in mind, I decided to write a few columns where I highlight some
common-but-easy-to-overlook tools that make life as a sysadmin (and really,
any Linux user) easier. I start the series with a classic
troubleshooting tool: sar.
</p><p>
There's an old saying: &ldquo;When the cat's away the mice will
play.&rdquo; The same
is true for servers. It's as if servers wait until you aren't logged in
(and usually in the middle of REM sleep) before they have problems. Logs
can go a long way to help you isolate problems that happened in the past on a machine, but if the problem is due to high load, logs often don't tell the
full story. In my March 2010 column &ldquo;Linux Troubleshooting, Part I: High
Load&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10688" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10688</a>), I discussed how to troubleshoot a system with high load using tools
such as uptime and top. Those tools are great as long as the system still
has high load when you are logged in, but if the system had high load while
you were at lunch or asleep, you need some way to pull the same statistics
top gives you, only from the past. That is where sar comes in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed3720"></a>
Enable sar Logging</h2></div></div><p>
sar is a classic Linux tool that is part of the sysstat package and should
be available in just about any major distribution with your regular package
manager. Once installed, it will be enabled on a Red Hat-based system, but
on a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you might have to edit
/etc/default/sysstat, and make sure that <tt  >ENABLED</tt> is set to true. On a Red
Hat-based system, sar will log seven days of statistics by default. If you
want to log more than that, you can edit /etc/sysconfig/sysstat and change
the <tt  >HISTORY</tt> option.
</p><p>
Once sysstat is configured and enabled, it will collect statistics about
your system every ten minutes and store them in a logfile under either
/var/log/sysstat or /var/log/sa via a cron job in /etc/cron.d/sysstat.
There is also a daily cron job that will run right before midnight and
rotate out the day's statistics. By default, the logfiles will be
date-stamped with the current day of the month, so the logs will rotate automatically
and overwrite the log from a month ago.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed3930"></a>
CPU Statistics</h2></div></div><p>
After your system has had some time to collect statistics, you can use the
sar tool to retrieve them. When run with no other arguments, sar displays
the current day's CPU statistics:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar
. . .
07:05:01 PM  CPU  %user  %nice  %system  %iowait %steal  %idle
. . .
08:45:01 PM  all   4.62   0.00     1.82     0.44   0.00   93.12
08:55:01 PM  all   3.80   0.00     1.74     0.47   0.00   93.99
09:05:01 PM  all   5.85   0.00     2.01     0.66   0.00   91.48
09:15:01 PM  all   3.64   0.00     1.75     0.35   0.00   94.26
Average:     all   7.82   0.00     1.82     1.14   0.00   89.21
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are familiar with the command-line tool top, the above CPU
statistics should look familiar, as they are the same as you would get in
real time from top. You can use these statistics just like you would with
top, only in this case, you are able to see the state of the system back in
time, along with an overall average at the bottom of the statistics, so you
can get a sense of what is normal. Because I devoted an entire previous column to
using these statistics to troubleshoot high load, I won't rehash all of that
here, but essentially, sar provides you with all of the same statistics, just
at ten-minute intervals in the past.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed3b40"></a>
RAM Statistics</h2></div></div><p>
sar also supports a large number of different options you can use to pull
out other statistics. For instance, with the <tt  >-r</tt> option, you can see RAM
statistics:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar -r
. . .
07:05:01 PM kbmemfree kbmemused %memused kbbuffers  kbcached  
kbcommit  %commit
. . .
08:45:01 PM    881280   2652840     75.06    355284   1028636   
8336664    183.87
08:55:01 PM    881412   2652708     75.06    355872   1029024   
8337908    183.89
09:05:01 PM    879164   2654956     75.12    356480   1029428   
8337040    183.87
09:15:01 PM    886724   2647396     74.91    356960   1029592   
8332344    183.77
Average:       851787   2682333     75.90    338612   1081838   
8341742    183.98
</pre>
</p><p>
Just like with the CPU statistics, here I can see RAM statistics from the
past similar to what I could find in top.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed3e00"></a>
Disk Statistics</h2></div></div><p>
Back in my load troubleshooting column, I referenced sysstat as the source
for a great disk I/O troubleshooting tool called iostat. Although that
provides
real-time disk I/O statistics, you also can pass sar the
<tt  >-b</tt> option to
get disk I/O data from the past:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar -b
. . .
07:05:01 PM    tps    rtps    wtps   bread/s   bwrtn/s
. . .
08:45:01 PM   2.03    0.33    1.70      9.90     31.30
08:55:01 PM   1.93    0.03    1.90      1.04     31.95
09:05:01 PM   2.71    0.02    2.69      0.69     48.67
09:15:01 PM   1.52    0.02    1.50      0.20     27.08
Average:      5.92    3.42    2.50     77.41     49.97
</pre>
</p><p>
I figure these columns need a little explanation:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >tps</tt>: transactions per second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >rtps</tt>: read transactions per second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >wtps</tt>: write transactions per second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >bread/s</tt>: blocks read per second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >bwrtn/s</tt>: blocks written per second.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
sar can return a lot of other statistics beyond what I've mentioned, but if
you want to see everything it has to offer, simply pass the
<tt  >-A</tt>
option, which will return a complete dump of all the statistics it has for
the day (or just browse its man page).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddb580.0x1ed4698"></a>
Turn Back Time</h2></div></div><p>
So by default, sar returns statistics for the current day, but often you'll
want to get information a few days in the past. This is especially useful
if you want to see whether today's numbers are normal by comparing them to days
in the past, or if you are troubleshooting a server that misbehaved over
the weekend. For instance, say you noticed a problem on a server
today between 5PM and 5:30PM. First, use the
<tt  >-s</tt> and <tt  >-e</tt> options
to tell sar to display data only between the start
(<tt  >-s</tt>) and end (<tt  >-e</tt>) times
you specify:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar -s 17:00:00 -e 17:30:00
Linux 2.6.32-29-server (www.example.net)  02/06/2012   _x86_64_
(2 CPU)

05:05:01 PM  CPU  %user  %nice %system %iowait  %steal  %idle
05:15:01 PM  all   4.39   0.00    1.83    0.39    0.00   93.39
05:25:01 PM  all   5.76   0.00    2.23    0.41    0.00   91.60
Average:     all   5.08   0.00    2.03    0.40    0.00   92.50
</pre>
</p><p>
To compare that data with the same time period from a different day,
just use the <tt  >-f</tt> option and point sar to one of the logfiles under
/var/log/sysstat or /var/log/sa that correspond to that day. For instance,
to pull statistics from the first of the month:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar -s 17:00:00 -e 17:30:00 -f /var/log/sysstat/sa01 
Linux 2.6.32-29-server (www.example.net)  02/01/2012   _x86_64_
(2 CPU)

05:05:01 PM  CPU  %user  %nice  %system  %iowait %steal  %idle
05:15:01 PM  all   9.85   0.00     3.95     0.56   0.00   85.64
05:25:01 PM  all   5.32   0.00     1.81     0.44   0.00   92.43
Average:     all   7.59   0.00     2.88     0.50   0.00   89.04
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can add all of the normal sar options when pulling from past logfiles, so you could run the same command and add the
<tt  >-r</tt> argument to get RAM
statistics:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sar -s 17:00:00 -e 17:30:00 -f /var/log/sysstat/sa01 -r
Linux 2.6.32-29-server (www.example.net)  02/01/2012   _x86_64_
(2 CPU)

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, sar is a relatively simple but very useful troubleshooting
tool. Although plenty of other programs exist that can pull
trending data from your servers and graph them (and I use them myself), sar
is great in that it doesn't require a network connection, so if your server
gets so heavily loaded it doesn't respond over the network anymore, there's
still a chance you could get valuable troubleshooting data with sar.
