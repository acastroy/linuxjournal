If you're creating Web apps, you're designing APIs. Here are some things to
keep in mind before you begin.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d51300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Web was designed for people. When Tim Berners-Lee created the
trio of standards that make up the Web&mdash;HTTP, HTML and URLs&mdash;the
intention was for people to browse Web sites, submit information to
them and be at the heart of the experience. But for some time
now, the notion of the Web as a set of sites that people browse has
been somewhat untrue. True, hundreds of millions of people visit an
equally large number of sites each day; however, more and more of the
visitors to sites aren't people, but programs.
</p><p>
Some of those programs exist to collect information on behalf of
other systems. For example, when you search the Web using a site such
as Google, you're obviously not searching through all of these sites
in real time. Rather, you're asking Google to search through its
massive index&mdash;an index that it has created and updated via its
&ldquo;bots&rdquo;, programs that go to a Web site, pretend to browse as a
person, and then track whatever they find.
</p><p>
But more and more, the programs that are visiting sites aren't doing
it on behalf of search indexes. Rather, they're doing it on behalf of...well, on behalf of themselves. Computers exchange information via
the Web, using a variety of protocols and data formats. Native apps
on mobile devices are using the Web behind the scenes to query Web
applications. And, even those Web applications using Ajax are
interacting with a Web site without directly being asked to do so.
</p><p>
This represents a massive shift in what Web applications are
doing. No longer are we just producing HTML for users (and search
bots). Now, we're producing output that's meant for programmatic
consumption&mdash;and in many cases, the same people are writing the
client and server sides. Sure, we could use &ldquo;scraping&rdquo; techniques to
retrieve the HTML and search through it, but why do so? If we already
know we'll be sending data to a program, there's no reason
to send HTML. Rather, we can send it in a more program-friendly data
format, without all the bells and whistles that people require.
</p><p>
When such use began, people made a big deal out of it. This trend was
known as &ldquo;Web services&rdquo;, and a lot of companies&mdash;most prominently
Amazon&mdash;jumped on them, describing all sorts of standards, from
XML-RPC to SOAP to WSDL. These protocols are still used, especially
by large-scale enterprise applications, to communicate with one
another.
</p><p>
But during the last few years, a more informal sort of API has emerged.
Sometimes it's based on XML, but more often it's based on JSON, the
&ldquo;JavaScript Object Notation&rdquo; format that works not only with
JavaScript, but with a wide variety of other languages as well.
</p><p>
(By &ldquo;more informal&rdquo;, I don't mean that it's not useful or that more
formality is needed. I'm merely referring to the fact that it
requires coordination between the client and server software authors,
rather than adherence to a specification document or established
protocol.)
</p><p>
This month, I'm looking at these sorts of APIs&mdash;why you would want
them, the different styles you can use in designing them, and then how
to access and use them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d518d8"></a>
Why an API?</h2></div></div><p>
If you're running a Web application, you probably will want to
provide an API at some point. Why? Well, there are a number of
reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
To allow your users access to their data via third-party
applications. Consider how many third-party Twitter clients exist,
all of which use Twitter's API, rather than the Web site. The same
is true for Amazon and eBay, among others, which allow users to
access their catalog data and even execute sales, all via the API.
</p></li><li><p>
To allow mobile app developers to access your site. Mobile apps&mdash;that
is, those running on such operating systems as Android and iOS&mdash;often send and retrieve data using HTTP, providing their own
front end, in what we might consider a &ldquo;domain-specific
browser&rdquo;,
albeit with a non-Web interface.
</p></li><li><p>
To allow your own application to access its own data via Ajax calls.
When you make a JavaScript call in the background using Ajax, you
most likely will want to make use of an API call, receiving XML or
JSON, rather than HTML that requires further parsing.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'm sure there are additional reasons for providing an API, but
even one of these might be a compelling reason in your case&mdash;and two
or three of them might apply as well. There's also an element of
customer openness and trust that comes with an API. I'm much more
likely to use a Web application, particularly if it's one for which
I'm paying, that provides an API to some or all of its functionality.
Even if I never end up making use of it, I know I can do so potentially,
which gives me a feeling of being a potential partner of the
application's authors, rather than a simple user.
</p><p>
The above also demonstrates that even if you never plan to open up your
API to the outside world, it might still be in your interest to
design one. Indeed, I've recently heard several experienced Web
developers argue that a modern Web site should not be designed as a
set of pages, with the API tacked on as an afterthought, but rather as
a set of APIs, which can be accessed via a mobile app, a remote client
application, Ajax calls or a client-side framework, such as Backbone.
In other words, first you establish your APIs, and then you get to
work writing applications that use those APIs.
</p><p>
In many ways, this is an attractive thought, one that has the
potential to make applications cleaner and easier to write and test.
After all, the idea behind the MVC (model-view-controller) paradigm is
to separate the different components, such that the business logic has
no interaction with the interface presented to the user. MVC-style
Web frameworks, such as Rails and Django, encourage this separation,
but creating an API makes the distinctions even sharper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d51e00"></a>
API Styles</h2></div></div><p>
If you have decided to create an API, there are several questions
to ask. One of them is what style of API you will use. The Ruby on
Rails community has rallied around the idea of
REST&mdash;&ldquo;representational state transfer&rdquo;, a term coined by
Roy Fielding&mdash;which basically assumes that each URL uniquely identifies a resource
on the Internet. Different actions performed on that resource do not
make use of different URLs, but rather of different HTTP request
methods.
</p><p>
For example, if you have an address book containing information on
many people, the first entry might have a URL of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/people/1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d52010"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In such a case, you could retrieve information with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /people/1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d52170"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and a new entry with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
POST /people
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that POST requests send their name-value pairs separately
from the URL. Because the parameters aren't part of the URL, it 
sometimes can be a bit tricky to know precisely what is being sent to the
server. I generally check the parameters that are being sent using a
combination of tools, including the server's logfile, the Firebug
plugin for Firefox, the Web developer plugin for Firefox or the
ngrep command-line tool for finding and displaying selected network
packets.
</p><p>
In the Ruby on Rails universe, you can update an existing entry using
the little-known (and little-supported, at least for now) PUT request
method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PUT /people/1
</pre>
</p><p>
As with POST, the parameters in a PUT request are sent separately from
the URL. Trickier yet is the fact that many browsers cannot handle
PUT requests directly. The solution that Rails employs, for the time
being, is to use POST, but to add a &ldquo;_method&rdquo; parameter as part of the
request. When the server sees this, it uses the action that should be
associated with PUT, rather than with POST. The system works well,
although it obviously would be better if browsers were able to support
all of the standard HTTP requests.
</p><p>
One of the key things to remember when working with REST is that URLs
should refer to nouns, not verbs. Thus, it's perfectly acceptable,
within the REST world, to have URLs that refer to any object on your
system, from users to books to airplanes to credit-card statements.
However, it's not acceptable to name the action you wish to take in
the URL. So:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/airplanes/523
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d52590"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would be perfectly acceptable, but:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/airplanes/get_passenger_list/523
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d526f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would not be. The difference being, of course, that
get_passenger_list is presumably the name of an action that you wish to
take on the airplane resource. This means you're no longer using
the URL to refer to a specific resource, but instead to an action.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d527f8"></a>
RESTless Development</h2></div></div><p>
When it was announced that Rails was moving toward REST, I must admit
I was somewhat resistant. I preferred to use URLs that had been
traditional in the Rails world until then, naming the controller and
action, as well as an object ID, in the URL. Thus, if I wanted to
retrieve one person's address, I would use a URL such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/people/get_address/2341
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x1d52958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where 2341 would be the unique ID for that person. And, for the most
part, this paradigm worked just fine.
</p><p>
But, then I discovered what many Rails developers find out: that Rails
is, as it claims to be, &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; software, meaning that things
are extremely easy if you do them the way it was designed, and
very difficult if you try it in any other way. And as time went on,
it became clear that my non-REST URLs were giving me problems. Many
elements of Rails were no longer working for me, because they depended
on REST. When I started to work with Backbone.js in 2011, I found
that Backbone works with a variety of back ends, including Rails,
but that using a non-REST interface was clumsy to work with, if it was
even possible to use at all.
</p><p>
Thus, I began to get REST religion and tried to make every application
I wrote conform to this sort of API, and it worked in many ways.
The APIs were consistent, and my code was consistent. Because I was
using the scaffolding that Rails provided&mdash;if only at the start of a
project&mdash;the code was smaller and more consistent than otherwise would have
been the case. In the case of Rails, which dynamically
creates identifiers that represent specific URLs (for example, addresses),
sticking with the RESTful routes really simplified things.
</p><p>
That is, until it didn't do so. REST, at least in the Rails
implementation, gives you a single HTTP request method for each action
you want to perform on your resource. This works well, in my
experience, until you want to retrieve resources based on parameters,
at which point things can get a bit complicated. Sure, you can pass
parameters in the HTTP request, but at a certain point, I 
personally would rather have several small methods than one method with a
huge set of if-then statements reflecting different combinations of
parameters.
</p><p>
Thus, I've pulled back a bit from my REST absolutism, and I feel like
I've reached something of a balance. For creation, updating and
deletion, I'm totally fine with using the RESTful paradigm. But when
it comes to retrieving resources from a Web application, I've relaxed
my requirements, trying to make my API be as expressive and flexible
as possible, without creating a huge number of routes or actions in my
controller.
</p><p>
For example, I'm totally fine with retrieving information about a
single user using the /users URL, tacking on an ID number to get
information about a specific one. But, I often want to implement a
search system to look for people in the system whose names match a
particular pattern. Back in my pre-REST days, I would have used a
search controller and had one or more methods that performed a
search. In my neo-REST world, I simply add a &ldquo;search&rdquo; method to my
&ldquo;users&rdquo; resource, such that the URL /users/search represents a
search. Is that breaking REST? Absolutely. But, I've found that it
makes my API more understandable and maintainable for my users, as well
as for myself.
</p><p>
Rails itself, as opinionated and RESTful as it might be, offers you an
out in the routes file (config/routes.rb). A recent project on which
I worked had the following route:

<pre     class="programlisting">
resources :articles
</pre>
</p><p>
This translates into the usual combination of RESTful routes and HTTP
request methods. But when I decided to add three additional API
calls to grab particular types of articles, I was able to do this by
adding a block to the resources declaration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
resources :articles do
    get :latest, :on =&gt; :collection
    get :article_links, :on =&gt; :member
    get :stories, :on =&gt; :collection
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Not only does Rails offer this possibility, but it differentiates
between &ldquo;member&rdquo; routes (which require a resource ID) and
&ldquo;collection&rdquo; routes (which don't require a resource ID,
because
they operate on the entire collection).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c59580.0x214b1d8"></a>
General Practices</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've set up your API-naming convention, you need to consider
what data you'll be passing. This means deciding on a data format,
the parameters you'll receive in that format and the response you'll
send back in that format.
</p><p>
When it comes to formats, there are really two main players nowadays:
XML and JSON. As I mentioned previously, XML is very popular among
enterprise users, but JSON has become very popular because of how
easily you can transform objects from such languages as Python and
Ruby into JSON (and back). In addition, JSON is nearly as
self-documenting as XML, without the huge textual overhead or the
complexity of an XML parser. Like many other people, I've 
switched to JSON for all of my API needs, and I haven't regretted it
at all.
</p><p>
That said, Rails offers the option of responding in any of several
different formats with the respond_to block. It basically lets you
say, &ldquo;if users want JSON, do A, but if they want XML, then do
B.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As for the request and response parameters, I try to keep it pretty
simple. However, there's one parameter you absolutely
should include in any API you create, and that's a version number. Your
API presumably will evolve and improve over time, adding and removing
method names, parameters and parameter types. By passing a version
number along with your parameters, you can ensure that you're
getting the parameters you require, and that both the client's and
server's expectations are in sync.
</p><p>
Moreover, I've found that you can use that version number as a key in
a hash of parameter lists. That is, rather than having separate
variables in your server-side program that track which parameters are
expected for each version, you can have a single hash whose keys are
version numbers and whose values are arrays of expected parameters.
You even can go one step further than this, having a multilevel hash
that tracks different parameters for various API calls. For example,
consider the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
EXPECTED_PARAMS = { 'location' =&gt; {
    1 =&gt; ['longitude', 'latitude', 'altitude'],
    2 =&gt; [longitude', 'latitude', 'altitude', 'speed', 'timestamp'],
  },

  'reading' =&gt; {
    1 =&gt; ['time', 'area', 'mean', 'good', 'number'],
    2 =&gt; ['time', 'area', 'mean', 'good', 'number', 'seen', 'span',
    &#8618;'stdDev']
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can do something like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
version_number = params['version_number'].to_i
method_name = params['action']
required_fields = EXPECTED_PARAMS[method_name][version_number]
</pre>
</p><p>
This is far easier than a lot of if-then statements, and it allows me to
centralize the definition of what I expect to receive from my API
clients. If I wanted to validate the data further, I could make each
array element a hash rather than a string, listing one or more
criteria that the data would need to pass.
</p><p>
Finally, the response that you give to your API users is your public
face to the world. If you provide useless error messages, such as
&ldquo;Something went wrong&rdquo;, you'll presumably discover that
developers are less than happy to use your system or develop on
top of it. But if you provide detailed responses when things go well
and poorly, not only will developers enjoy your system, but their
end users will as well.
