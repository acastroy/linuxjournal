Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. I trust that you
took good care of the restaurant while I was away on my whirlwind
tour of Europe, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Well, thank you for
asking, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. It was indeed, a fine
journey. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, the food was great as well, but
no restaurant is blessed with such a waiter as yourself.
</p><p>I have seen cities of lights and cities of music&mdash;London,
Salzburg, Rome, Florence and many others. Then, of course, there
was the ultimate city of lights, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paris</em></span>. It
seems somehow fitting that it is in this atmosphere of celebration
that I had to prepare the menu for <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s special 100th anniversary issue.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, what better way to
celebrate than with music and light? Quickly before our guests
arrive, head down to the cellar and bring up the 1989
Pessac-L&eacute;ognan.</p><p>But our guests are already here. Fran&ccedil;ois.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>! Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
sit and make yourselves comfortable. Today's menu of fine Linux
cuisine is a bit of an occasion. <i  >Linux Journal</i>
is 100 issues old&mdash;a fine vintage indeed. Have a look at the first
item on the menu, a little something called XMMS. Basically a
standard Linux media player, XMMS is much more than a music player.
Properly used, it is a spectacular light show as well. It supports
Ogg Vorbis, MP3 and WAV formats. With the right extensions you also
can use it to play RealAudio.</p><p>Every major Linux distribution comes with XMMS, so you don't
have to go far to find it. If it isn't already part of the
installation, then have a look on your distribution CD-ROM. If all
else fails, go to the source at
<a href="http://www.xmms.org" target="_self">www.xmms.org</a> for the
latest and greatest.</p><p>Building XMMS is easy and follows familiar steps. The current
version is based on GTK 1.2.2 or better, and you may need the
OpenGL or Mesa libraries if you want to use the OpenGL plugin (more
on that later). Starting with the source, here is what we
do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf xmms-1.2.7.tar.gz
cd xmms-1.2.7
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre><p>To start the program, type <b  >xmms &amp;</b> and
press the Enter key. If this is the first time you start XMMS,
you'll see something that looks like the amplifier on your home
stereo system (Figure 1).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6083f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Your Basic XMMS
</p></div></div>

</p><p>That is only the first module. Look at the buttons on the
right of the amplifier. You'll see one labeled EQ (the equalizer)
and PL (the playlist). Clicking these buttons will bring up two
additional modules for your stereo system. Because each of the
three modules can be moved about individually on the screen, you
may find yourself re-adjusting their position more often than you
care to. The easy way to solve this is by right clicking on the amp
module, choosing Options from the menu and then choosing Easy Move.
There's a Ctrl-E keyboard shortcut as well.</p><p>XMMS has extensive plugin support for input, output and
visualization. To get at these, use the Preferences menu (the
shortcut is Ctrl-P). A new window will pop up offering you tabs for
various runtime options, fonts and so on. This is also where you
find the control for the various audio I/O, special effects and
visualization plugins. If you find you are having any problems with
sound when you first start up XMMS, this is the place to look. Look
under the audio section and check the output plugin. Having built
my XMMS from scratch, I had to set the output plugin to OSS
Driver.</p><p>I could spend a great deal of time talking about the various
options, but instead, I invite you to check out the various options
on your own. In terms of visualization plugins, this is where the
light show begins. You'll notice that there are things like
Spectrum Analyzer and Blur Scope. Earlier on, I mentioned the
OpenGL Spectrum Analyzer, another cool plugin that provides
colorful 3-D visuals to accompany your music&mdash;you can even launch
that one full screen; sit back and enjoy the show.</p><p>One of my favorite features of XMMS (and there are quite a
few) is its <span   class="emphasis"><em>skinability</em></span>. Using skins, I can
change XMMS' look from its default black metal face to something
more classic, like cherry wood or a refined brushed aluminum. Using
the Ctrl-S shortcut brings up the Skin Browser, which you can also
select through the right-click menu. Of course, if you just
finished installing XMMS, you probably won't see anything there.
You need to get yourself some skins. For that, head back to the
XMMS web site and click Skins on the menu. I guarantee you won't be
getting bored anytime soon. There are literally tons of skins
available, including the aforementioned cherry-wood finish.</p><p>So, how do you install these skins? All of the skins on the
web site are in tar.gz format. Find one that appeals to you,
download it and save it to your $HOME/.xmms/Skins directory. You
don't need to extract the file&mdash;just save it to the directory. If I
turn out to be wrong, and you do get bored with the list on
<a href="http://www.xmms.org" target="_self">www.xmms.org</a>, you'll be
happy to know that XMMS supports Winamp skins as well. A visit to
<a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_self">www.winamp.com</a> should
keep you more than busy. Just click Skins off the menu and have
fun. In Figure 2, you'll see my classic cherry-wood XMMS system
with various light-show plugins running.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6083f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. The XMMS Visualization Light
Show</p></div></div>
</p><p>I'm going to leave XMMS behind on this topic of skins because
the next application does skins in a great way as well. If you are
running KDE, you have a great little program called Media Player.
You can access the program either by looking under the K menu,
choosing Multimedia, then clicking on the KDE Media Player, or you
can type <b  >noatun &amp;</b> at the command line. The
problem is that when you fire it up for the first time, it tends to
look a little boring, as in Figure 3.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6083f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The KDE Media Player (Default Skin)
</p></div></div><p>Don't let that disappoint you. That is the default skin,
named &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo;. Click on Settings followed by Configure
Noatun. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose Plugins, which
will then give you a tabbed menu. Under Interfaces, you'll see four
options for player styles. The skinnable styles are K-Jofol and
Kaiman. In both cases, you can find additional skins on the
KDE-Look web site at
<a href="http://www.kde-look.org" target="_self">www.kde-look.org</a>.
Actually, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, this is a great site to
visit for numerous ways to dress up your KDE environment, from
Noatun skins to desktop themes to replacement icon sets.</p><p>Start by clicking off the &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; interface and
clicking on the K-Jofol interface. You'll see the menubar at the
left change. It now shows a K-Jofol Skins option. The same would
happen with the Kaiman interface. If you click on this menu option,
you'll see a drop-down list on the right with a preview of the
various installed skins. For Noatun, skins live under the
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/noatun/skins directory.</p><p>To add new skins, switch to that directory, extract the skins
you downloaded from
<a href="http://www.kde-look.org" target="_self">www.kde-look.org</a>, and
you have just added a new skin. There is a catch, however. Unlike
XMMS, the skins must be in PNG format and must be extracted into
the skins directory. You can use skins you find on other sites, but
you need to convert the JPG images to PNG. Luckily, this is
extremely easy with the <span   class="bold"><b>convert</b></span>
command (part of the ImageMagick package):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
convert image.bmp image.jpg
</pre><p>That information is for KDE 2.x only. With KDE 3.x, you'll
find that things are a little different. In the
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/noatun/skins directory, you will find two
other directories called winamp and kaiman. If they don't already
exist, create them. Then, in the winamp directory, extract any of
the XMMS skins that you find appealing. For instance, let's go back
to my cherry-wood example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd $HOME/.kde/share/apps/noatun/skins/winamp
tar -xzvf /path_to/cherrywood.tar.gz
</pre>


Now, when you click Configure Noatun, you should see this new skin
under the Winskin list on the preferences menu.
</p><p>When I told you about XMMS, I mentioned the variety of cool
plugins you could use for visualization. KDE's Media Player,
Noatun, has these as well. Among my favorites are Tyler and Blur
Scope. Try some of these out for yourself, but be warned. The one
called Madness is <span   class="emphasis"><em>truly</em></span> madness. Don't try it
unless you are looking for a glimpse of temporary insanity. You
have been warned! For a sample of various plugins in action, have a
look at Figure 4.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6083f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. The KDE Noatun Light Show</p></div></div>
</p><p>Turn up that volume control, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
or should I say &ldquo;Crank it!&rdquo;? Fran&ccedil;ois (who has managed to
arrange a cameo in this very issue, see page 25) will refill your
glasses. Tonight, the cellar is open and you may have anything you
desire! Let the music play and the lights dance. It is time to
celebrate!</p><p>Until next month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>!
