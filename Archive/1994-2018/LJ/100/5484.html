    Charles describes the additions he made to the scripts for his backup and recovery suite.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c84298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imagine your disk drive has just become a
very expensive hockey puck. Imagine you have had a fire, and your
computer case now looks like something Salvador Dali would like to
paint. Now what?
</p><p>That's the way I started an article on this subject in the
November 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. The
article described a process for backing up a computer and
subsequently restoring it to the bare metal. The article described
a suite of scripts that were part of both the backup process and
the recovery process. Readers can find the article at
<a href="../079/4175.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4175</a>.</p><p>Since then I have added some scripts to the suite. Most of
the new scripts are designed for network backups and take advantage
of Secure Shell (SSH). (For more information on SSH, see Mick
Bauer's &ldquo;The 101 Uses of OpenSSH&rdquo; in the January and February
2001 issues of <i  >LJ</i>.) I've also made some
changes to the scripts introduced in the original article. The
suite of revised scripts is available at my home page (see
Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c84558"></a>The Flaw</h2></div></div><p>The biggest problem with my November 2000 article and the
process it described is that the process required a lot of typing
at the beginning of the recovery process. You have to enter
partition boundaries and other data into fdisk manually, then check
the results against your printout. (Printout!? for Murphy's sake!)
Then you manually create the appropriate filesystems for each
partition. Then you get to mount them, again manually.</p><p>This is a lot of typing. I don't know how many times I did
test backups and restores on my test computer while I was writing
the article. More than I ever want to do again, that's for sure.
It's also error prone. After a while all those numbers start to
blur together.</p><p>The obvious solution is a script or two. What we need is a
script that will restore the partition information to a hard drive,
then build the filesystems and mount them so that you can run the
first stage restoration.</p><p>My first pass at this script is the script make.partitions,
which is available in the tarball of scripts on my home page. It
has two problems: first, it does not rebuild the partitions, so you
still have to run fdisk manually; and second, it has to be created
by hand for each computer. Add, delete, reformat or otherwise
modify a partition, and you have to edit the script. That's not
good enough. The script, which is GPLed, should look somewhat like
Listing 1.</p><p><a href="5484l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
make.dev.hda</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c84818"></a>A Script-Writing Script</h2></div></div><p>The second solution is a lot smarter. Why not automate the
process? We use gcc to compile gcc. Heck, you can use gcc to
compile Perl. Why not a script that creates the script that
make.partitions should be? Why not a script-writing script?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>make.fdisk</b></span> parses the output
from fdisk -l and mount -l and creates a new script for restoring a
given hard drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c849d0"></a>Using Redirection</h2></div></div><p>The first problem we face is one I mentioned in the original
article: fdisk does not export partition information in a manner
that allows it to be re-imported later on. While other versions of
fdisk do allow exporting, tomsrtbt (the floppy-based distribution I
recommend for bare metal restore) comes with fdisk, and I don't
want to rebuild the tomsrtbt disk. We can handle this with
something all well-behaved Linux programs have: I/O redirection.
Given a program, foo and a file of commands for foo called bar, we
can feed the commands to foo by redirecting foo's input from the
keyboard to bar, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foo &lt; bar
</pre><p>So what we want to be able to do is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fdisk /dev/<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> &lt; dev.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
</pre>


where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is the name of the hard drive to be
rebuilt.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>make.fdisk</b></span> creates two
files. One is an executable script, called
make.dev.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, like Listing 1. The other,
dev.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, contains the commands necessary for
fdisk to build the partitions. You specify which hard drive you
want to build scripts for (and so the filenames) by naming the
associated device file as the argument to make.fdisk. For example,
on a typical IDE system,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make.fdisk /dev/hda
</pre><p>spits out the make.dev.hda script and the input file for
fdisk, dev.hda.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c84ef8"></a>How It Works</h2></div></div><p>As you look at the script make.fdisk shown in Listing 2
[available at
<a href="../listings/100/5484.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue100/5484.tgz</a>],
keep in mind what happens at what time. Like C source code, some
things happen later on, at runtime. Others happen at the time the
program is compiled, like evaluation of defines and inclusion of
header files.</p><p>On examining make.fdisk, the first thing we see is that it is
a Perl script. Next is a brief description of what the script does.
This is followed by a timestamp and two copyright statements. Then
we see the usual announcement that the code is free software and
distributed under the General Public License. Next is a detailed
description of the problem with fdisk we've already seen&mdash;and the
solution. It is good coding practice to document a program in this
manner; it makes the program almost self-documenting.</p><p>Now we get to actual Perl code. The subroutine cut2fmt takes
a series of column numbers and calculates a format string for later
use with unpack. Right after the subroutine we use it to create a
format string to unpack the output from fdisk.</p><p>After that is a series of definitions of the columns in
fdisk's output. With these, we can index into the array created
with unpack by name rather than by column number. This should make
the script easier to read and more maintainable.</p><p>The directory where the rebuilt hard drive will be mounted is
named $target so that the first stage restore can find it. Make
sure this agrees with the definition of $target in your copy of the
script restore.metadata.</p><p>Next, the code massages the device name to produce the
filenames where we will send our output. Then we define the path to
the directory where we will place the output files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c85210"></a>Disk Labels</h2></div></div><p>Labels are tools that Linux uses to abstract partitions. The
problem with using device filenames in fstab is that if you add or
remove a hard drive you may affect which device file another
partition shows up under. Labels travel with the partition, so that
with mounting by label you always get the correct partition. They
are a problem for us because tomsrtbt doesn't handle labels.</p><p>The next section of code executes mount with a command-line
switch to make it show the labels. If there is a label in any given
line, we save the label and the device filename in a hash. That
way, later on when we make the filesystem in the partition, we can
assign the label. Also, we need to mount the partition by a device
filename so that we can restore to it. We make a hash mapping from
device filename to mountpoint so that later on we can build the
mountpoint directories and mount the partitions.</p><p>Next is a typical Perl command to spawn a process and put the
results into a filehandle, in this case FDISK. It is complete with
error checking. Then we open our output file, which will eventually
be redirected as input to fdisk.</p><p>Now we begin a loop to parse each line of the output from the
system call to fdisk. We are interested in any line that has the
device in it. If we find one, we massage it a bit, unpack it into
the array @_ and further massage the array members.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c85420"></a>Disk Partitions</h2></div></div><p>If a partition number is less than five, it is either a
primary partition, meaning it can have a filesystem in it, or an
extended partition, meaning it can have a number of logical
partitions in it. In either case, we write the commands to build
the partition to the output file. If it is a Linux swap partition,
we have to tell fdisk to change its partition type.</p><p>If we see a primary partition that is either FAT (but, for
now, not FAT32), Linux or Linux swap, we append the appropriate
command to the $format to make the partition a FAT, ext2 filesystem
or a swap partition. Later on, we'll use $format to create the
output script.</p><p>A partition number of five or greater only can be a logical
partition, that is, one contained within an extended partition. As
far as we are concerned, these are either Linux ext3fs, Linux swap
partitions, FAT or anything else. As above, appropriate fdisk
commands are sent to the output file and appropriate commands to
create filesystems are appended to $format.</p><p>We look to see if there is a label for each ext2 partition.
If there is, we use a command that will recreate that label on the
new partition, otherwise we use the same command without a
label.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c85630"></a>Bad-Block Checking</h2></div></div><p>You will notice that there are two commands to make each
filesystem, with one commented out. The one commented out makes the
filesystem with no bad-block checking. If I were installing to a
brand-new hard drive, I would consider using this. The other does
bad-block checking. I prefer to check for bad blocks when reusing a
hard drive. The bad-block check is a simple read-only test, which
is reasonable most of the time. You can add a write test, which is
much more thorough but takes longer, by adding -w to the
command-line options for bad blocks. The write test is destructive,
but since you will be building a new filesystem in the partition,
you don't care.</p><p>At the end of our line-parsing loop, if any partition is
marked &ldquo;bootable&rdquo; (typically a MS-DOS, Windows or Windows NT
partition because LILO ignores the bootable flag), we send the
commands to make it bootable to the command file.</p><p>The last thing we do for the command file is send a &ldquo;v&rdquo;,
which will have fdisk verify the newly built partition table. Then
we send a &ldquo;w&rdquo;, which will cause fdisk to write the partition
table to the hard drive and then exit. We then close our two
files.</p><p>Next, we open the file that will become our script and send
an appropriate header to the script, similar to the header for this
script. The first thing the script actually will do is use dd to
write zeros over the first 1,024 bytes of the hard drive. This will
clobber any existing master boot record (MBR) so that we don't have
to worry about deleting partitions before creating the new
ones.</p><p>The next step is to create the command that will partition
the hard drive, using the command file we've already created. Then
the code walks through the hash of mountpoints, creating a comment
line, a command to create the directory and then a command to mount
the device filename to the directory.</p><p>We have to mount starting at the root partition so that
mountpoints are created in the correct partition. For example,
suppose /usr/local is on its own partition; we have to mount /usr
before we build /usr/local. To ensure that is done, we sort the
keys of the hash and process the hash in that order.</p><p>The last thing we do is change the mode of the files we've
just created. Since paranoids live longer, we disallow anyone but
root from even reading the script, and make it executable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c85948"></a>Using the Script</h2></div></div><p>The script make.fdisk should be run as a normal part of
preparing for backing up for bare metal recovery. Run it before you
run <b  >save.metadata</b> so that the output files are
saved to the ZIP drive. Better yet, have save.metadata call it,
once for each hard drive.</p><p>When you are restoring, run
<b  >make.dev.<i><tt>x</tt></i></b> for each
hard drive you have. Again, this can be automated by including it
in restore.metadata.</p><p>There are other things you can do with this script. Suppose
you want to add a new partition. Use the bare metal backup process
to save a hard drive, then edit the dev.x command file to change
the partition definitions and restore using the edited file. I
successfully added a 30MB Mess-DOS partition to my test computer
with this technique.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8c580.0x1c85c08"></a>Improvements</h2></div></div><p>Some improvements that you can tackle if you like include
having make.fdisk process several hard drives, all indicated on the
command line; adding error checking for the argument(s) to
make.fdisk, having it produce one script that builds all the hard
drives, extending the FAT filesystem support (for one thing, right
now the code ignores FAT32); and extending the code to support
other filesystems.</p><p><a href="5484s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
