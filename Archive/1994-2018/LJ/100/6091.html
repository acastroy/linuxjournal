    Mick explains how to use the owner match extension for iptables to prevent local users from violating your network's security protocols.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d2580.0x29ca298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most of us think of iptables strictly as
a firewall tool for keeping remote attackers at bay. But did you
know it also can be used to keep local users in line? The
experimental match extension owner adds new iptables options that
can be used to help prevent local users from sending packets
through other local users' network processes.
</p><p>For example, suppose one of root's cron jobs uses Stunnel to
send files to a remote rsync process. While that tunnel is open,
any local user also may use it to access the remote rsync server.
<span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> can help you prevent such
sponging; this month's column shows how.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d2580.0x29ca450"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>Tunneling utilities comprise one of the most important new
categories of security tools at our disposal. They allow us to wrap
insecure services, such as Telnet, IMAP and POP3, in encrypted
virtual &ldquo;tunnels&rdquo;, transparently and effectively. I've written at
length in these pages about the Secure Shell and its powerful
port-forwarding capabilities; Stunnel and SSLWrap are similar free
tools that can be used for this purpose under Linux.</p><p>But what happens when you set up such a tunnel on a
multi-user system? What's to stop unauthorized local users from
sending their own traffic through the tunnel? Until recently,
practically nothing. Since most tunneling utilities work by
creating a new local listener (e.g., localhost:992) for the near
side of the tunnel, and since normally any local user can connect
to a local listening-port, it's usually up to the server
application at the other end of the tunnel to authenticate
users.</p><p>For example, suppose I use Stunnel to create a secure sockets
layer (SSL) tunnel from my local system &ldquo;crueller&rdquo; to the remote
system &ldquo;strudel&rdquo;, over which I'm going to run Telnet. (Never mind
that this sort of transaction is simpler with SSH; maybe I don't
want SSH installed locally for some reason.) On the remote host,
which is already running the Telnet d&aelig;mon (via inetd) on TCP
port 23, I run Stunnel in d&aelig;mon mode with this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
stunnel -d 992 -r localhost:23 -p \
/etc/stunnel/strudel.pem
</pre><p>On the local host, I'll run Stunnel in client mode, also
listening on the local port TCP 992 but forwarding connections to
TCP port 992 on strudel:
<pre     class="programlisting">
stunnel -c -d 992 -r strudel:992
</pre>


If you've never used Stunnel before and these two commands mean
nothing to you, don't worry. The important thing to understand is
that to use this example tunnel to Telnet securely from crueller to
strudel, I'll use this command on crueller:
<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet localhost 992
</pre>


At this point, I'll be prompted for a user name and password by
strudel, and unlike with normal Telnet, my login credentials will
be encrypted by Stunnel rather than transmitted over the network as
clear text. (The remote Stunnel process will decrypt the packets
and hand them to strudel's local Telnet process. This happens for
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> Telnet transaction, not just the
authentication part; Stunnel acts as a middleman for both parties
during the entire transaction, a middleman who neither knows nor
cares what he's tunneling as long as it's TCP.)
</p><p>So far so good; I've got encryption, which I didn't have
without Stunnel, and I've got a modest amount of authentication by
virtue of Telnet itself. The problem is that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> user on crueller can Telnet to the local
Stunnel listener on TCP 992 and try to log in to strudel. Maybe I'm
worried about someone guessing my strudel password and maybe I'm
not; but how to stop them from sending <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
packets down the tunnel to begin with? With iptables and its new
owner match extension, that's how.</p><p><a href="6091s1.html" target="_self">Stunnel Who?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d2580.0x29ca978"></a>The Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span>' owner match
extension adds four match criteria to the iptables command:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&mdash;uid-owner <span   class="emphasis"><em>UID</em></span>: matches
packets generated by a process whose user ID is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UID</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>&mdash;gid-owner <span   class="emphasis"><em>GID</em></span>: matches
packets generated by a process whose group ID is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GID</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>&mdash;pid-owner <span   class="emphasis"><em>PID</em></span>: matches
packets generated by a process whose process ID is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PID</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>&mdash;sid-owner <span   class="emphasis"><em>SID</em></span>: matches
packets generated by a process whose session ID is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SID</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of these four, the first two are the most useful for our
purposes here.</p><p>The owner match extension isn't necessarily included in your
distribution's stock kernel; it's considered an experimental
feature (by the Linux kernel team, not necessarily by the iptables
team), so you may need to compile it yourself. Its source code,
however, <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> part of the standard 2.4 kernel
codebase, so this is done easily with any recent version of your
distribution's (2.4.x) kernel source package.</p><p>When recompiling your kernel, you'll need to set several
things explicitly. First, under Code maturity level options, select
&ldquo;Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers&rdquo;.</p><p>Next, in addition to the other network protocols and features
you customarily select in Networking options, make sure to select
&ldquo;Network Packet Filtering&rdquo;. This will enable the subgroup IP:
Netfilter Configuration, shown in Figure 1. You may compile these
options either into the kernel (by selecting them with an asterisk)
or as modules (with an M), but most people compile them as modules
because all are seldom used at one time.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6091f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Compiling a Kernel with owner Match Extension Support
</p></div></div><p>Naturally you can select as many of the Netfilter modules as
you like. They don't take up much disk space, and if compiled as
modules they needn't be loaded unless necessary. The one we're most
concerned with right now, though, is owner Match Support.</p><p>The rest of the procedure for compiling and installing the
Linux kernel and its modules is well documented elsewhere (notably
in the kernel source's own README file). Once you've compiled,
installed and rebooted with your kernel, you can use your shiny new
owner module, which will be named ipt_owner.</p><p>To load this module, use the modprobe command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe ipt_owner
</pre><p>In practice you'll probably want to load your iptables rules
from a startup script in /etc/inet.d. If so, make sure you add the
above modprobe line to the beginning of this script (i.e., above
any iptables commands that use owner matches).
</p><p>Note: neither Bastille-Linux's automated firewall
configuration functionality nor SuSE Linux's SuSEfirewall scripts
support owner matching without major hacking. This should hardly be
surprising; they and other simple packet-filter rule generators are
intended primarily for low-impact internet protection, not for the
advanced control of local user access. For the latter, you need to
write your own iptables rules.</p><p>Let's return to our example Stunnel client, crueller. Suppose
crueller's kernel has been compiled with the ipt_owner module.
You've loaded this module with modprobe and, for the time being,
iptables isn't configured, i.e., nothing's being filtered
yet.</p><p>Suppose further that you wish to restrict use of the
Telnet-over-Stunnel socket we considered at the beginning of the
article to root only. (You may recall we set up a Stunnel listener
on crueller at TCP port 992, which encrypts and forwards packets to
the same TCP port on strudel.)</p><p>If crueller isn't a firewall, we may be able to get away with
an accept-by-default policy for the OUTPUT chain. On firewalls, all
chains should have a drop-by-default or reject-by-default policy,
but single-homed (single-network-interface) bastion hosts may
sometimes have a more permissive stance on outbound traffic. If
this is the case on crueller, then we need only one filtering rule
to achieve the desired restriction:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 992 -d localhost \
-m owner ! --uid-owner root -j REJECT
</pre><p>Let's dissect that command line one field at a time:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>-A OUTPUT: tells iptables we want to add a rule at
the end of the chain OUTPUT. Since owner matches apply only to
packets originating locally, and since outbound traffic is handled
in the OUTPUT chain, this is the only chain in which you can use
owner matches.</p></li><li><p>-p tcp: tells iptables to match only TCP packets
and to load iptables' TCP options.</p></li><li><p>&mdash;dport 992: this TCP-specific option tells
iptables to match only TCP packets destined for port 992.</p></li><li><p>-d localhost: tells iptables to match packets
destined for the localhost (i.e., the loopback interface
127.0.0.1).</p></li><li><p>-m owner: tells iptables to load the owner match
extension.</p></li><li><p>! --uid-owner root: tells iptables to match only
packets not created by processes owned by root.</p></li><li><p>-j REJECT: tells iptables to reject packets that
meet all match expressions in this line.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>In summary, this rule tells the kernel (via iptables) to drop
packets sent to the local TCP port 992 unless they're sent by one
of root's processes.</p><p>Suppose now that crueller has the more cautious default
OUTPUT policy of DROP rather than ACCEPT. A drop-by-default policy
is preferable on most iptables installations; the Principle of
Least Privilege is one of the most important concepts in
information security (i.e., &ldquo;that which is not explicitly
permitted must be denied&rdquo;).</p><p>Now, however, we'll need a longer OUTPUT chain. Starting
again with an empty chain, first we'll need to tell iptables to
pass packets belonging to sessions it has already accepted:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -m state --state \
ESTABLISHED,NEW -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>The -state match extension provides iptables with crucial
state-tracking abilities, allowing iptables to evaluate packets in
relation to actual sessions and data streams. Aside from the
desirability of this intelligence for its own sake, it also
drastically reduces the number of rules you need to specify in
order to accommodate a single transaction. Without state tracking,
you'd need two rules rather than one to allow, for example, an
outbound Telnet transaction; one each in the OUTPUT and INPUT
chains. This is why the above rule should nearly always be used at
the top of any chain whose default policy is DROP.
</p><p>Next, we need to allow Stunnel itself to connect to
strudel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
stunnel -A OUTPUT -p tcp -dport 992 -d strudel \
-j ACCEPT
</pre><p>This command appends a new rule to the bottom of the OUTPUT
chain that permits outbound connections to TCP port 992 on strudel.
</p><p>Finally, we enter a command similar to the one in the
accept-by-default example, but this one is for the target ACCEPT
rather than REJECT and for the absence of the negating exclamation
point before the --uid-owner option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 992 -d localhost \
-m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT
</pre><p><a href="6091s2.html" target="_self">Remote Users and Tunnel
Ports</a>
</p><p>Let's look at one more example.
<span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span> is a powerful file-transfer
utility that can perform differential file transfers. It can
compare a remote file with a local copy and download only those
parts that differ. <span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span> can be
used in conjunction with SSH or, you guessed it, with
Stunnel.</p><p>Suppose you've got a cron job on crueller that uses rsync to
compare the file stuff.txt on strudel with a local copy and
downloads any differences. Suppose further that stuff.txt contains
some sensitive stuff, so you use Stunnel to encrypt these
transfers. But only the local administrators, all of whom belong to
the group &ldquo;wheel&rdquo;, need to control the script or use the
tunnel.</p><p>On strudel, rsync is running in d&aelig;mon mode, having been
configured to share a module (virtual volume) named attic. Assuming
/etc/rsyncd.conf is properly configured (the specifics of which are
beyond this article's scope), the command to run rsync in
d&aelig;mon mode is simply:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsync --daemon
</pre><p>In addition, strudel also has a Stunnel listener on TCP port
273 that decrypts and forwards traffic to the rsync process (which
is itself listening on TCP port 873). The command to run Stunnel
this way on strudel would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
stunnel -d 273 -r localhost:873 -p /etc/stunnel/
    strudel.pem
</pre>


On crueller, a corresponding client-mode Stunnel listener would be
invoked like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
stunnel -c -d 273 -r strudel:273
</pre>


Okay, we now have a tunnel set up whereby packets sent to TCP port
273 on crueller will be encrypted and sent to TCP port 273 on
strudel, where they'll be decrypted and forwarded to strudel's
local rsync process on TCP 873.
</p><p>In the absence of iptables rules, if the ordinary user
plebian on crueller tries to use the tunnel, he or she will
succeed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsync --port=273 -v localhost::attic/stuff.txt .
stuff.txt
wrote 508 bytes  read 575 bytes  2166.00 bytes/sec
total size is 48188  speedup is 44.49
</pre><p>Unless, that is, we add an iptables rule on crueller that
restricts local use of the rsync tunnel to members of the group
wheel:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d localhost --dport 272 \
-m owner ! --gid-owner wheel -j REJECT
</pre>


Now, plebian's attempt to pilfer the new stuff.txt file will fail:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync --port=273 -v localhost::attic/stuff.txt .
rsync: failed to connect to localhost:
    Connection refused
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10)
    at clientserver.c(97)
</pre>


But if wheel group member admin7 tries to connect, this will
succeed:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync --port=272 -v localhost::chumly/stuff.txt .
stuff.txt
wrote 508 bytes  read 575 bytes  2166.00 bytes/sec
total size is 48188  speedup is 44.49
</pre>


Hopefully, you noticed that this presumes a default allow policy.
If OUTPUT instead uses a default drop policy, we'd need a rule in
the OUTPUT chain allowing an outbound connection to TCP 273 on
strudel. The OUTPUT chain also would need to begin with an allow
established/related sessions rule. Since both these rules would
resemble strongly those in the previous example, I won't bother
showing them here.

Stunnel</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, the uses of --uid-owner and --gid-owner are
pretty straightforward. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that
both options accept names, as I've shown in the examples, or
numeric IDs.</p><p>Another issue I've dodged is TCP Wrappers-style access
controls. On any system that uses TCP Wrappers (or whose stunnel
binary was compiled with support for libwrapper), you must add
appropriate entries to /etc/hosts.allow for Stunnel to work
properly, whether you run Stunnel in client mode or d&aelig;mon
mode on that host. This is a good thing; rather than being one more
thing capable of preventing Stunnel from working, you should think
of it as another layer of your security onion.</p><p>Finally, I'm leaving it to you to tinker with --pid-owner and
--sid-owner. I will give you a hint, though. Many d&aelig;mons
write their parent PID in a predictable place on startup, that is,
/var/run/sshd.pid. By reading such a PID file into a variable in
your iptables startup script, you can match packets originating
from a specific process. Good luck!</p><p><a href="6091s3.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
