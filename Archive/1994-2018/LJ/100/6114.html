    While I'm sure that this is only the first hundred-mark of
    many, you might want to keep this issue in good shape for putting in
    your children's time capsule.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1917580.0x1a0f190"></a></h2></div></div><p>I still tend to think of myself as a
newcomer to the magazine, having been on the masthead for only
one-fifth of the now 100 issues. But those 20 issues have been an
enriching experience. Each issue has presented its own challenges
and dilemmas.
</p><p>Some issues even hosted their own minor polemics. Nothing
sparks comment like nudity, and our staff had a lot of fun reading
and choosing which of the letters regarding the nude cover of the
Python supplement to print. Then there was the &ldquo;American&rdquo; debate,
begun in the November 2000 issue, which also spanned more than a
couple of issues. Who could forget the QSOL advertisement, also
from the November 2000 issue? The &ldquo;improper&rdquo; implication spawned
some memorable press, but I'm sure it would never have happened if
we hadn't made the first step and put the naked man on the cover,
obviously giving QSOL the impression that we were &ldquo;that kind of
magazine&rdquo;. QSOL's following ad was as frightening as the previous
ad was suggestive, perhaps in a effort to take revenge on on those
not yet prepared for their style of advertising.</p><p>These events made the letters section perhaps the most-read
part of the magazine, but the most fun part of working for
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has been the interaction with
both the Linux community and the rest of the hardworking
<i  >Linux Journal</i> staff.</p><p>As our magazine is one that relies on community-submitted
content, I've been fortunate to be able to get to know many very
talented hackers. And I'm not just talking about the famous members
of the Linux community. Just as some of the best actors in the
world are only seen on community stages, some of the smartest
coders are garage hobbyists or work for small companies. The
general high level of goodwill that emits from our authors, regular
contributing editors and is evident throughout the community,
consistently impresses me and makes my job a much happier one. Our
reliance on you&mdash;our readers and contributors&mdash;makes this 100th
issue celebration as much yours as it is ours. Sincere thanks for
all of your help and support.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard
