    We've added an embedded Linux development section with in-depth information on device-driver coding and more that even a desktop developer can use.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb2580.0xcaa138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Those of you who are primarily interested
in the development of embedded systems may ask why start reading
<i  >Linux Journal</i> now when you can just tell it's
going to be full of non-embedded stuff? And why should regular
Linux developers care about the embedded articles? The stuff you're
interested in won't run on a Linux watch anyway, right?
</p><p>The short answer is that Greg Kroah-Hartman's Driving Me Nuts
column, on device drivers, will be starting this month. Greg
maintains the Linux USB and PCI Hot Plug support and has written
great articles for both <i  >Linux Journal</i> and
<i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>. Now we bring you
Kernel Korner every month and Driving Me Nuts every other month,
which averages out to a monthly helping and a half of kernel
goodness you won't find anywhere else.</p><p>Now that you've sent in your subscription card, the long
answer is that Linux, and free software in general, are inherently
embeddable. By their nature, embedded projects thrive on software
that is free to port, customize and sell. If you don't believe
this, look at the spectacular success (ha!) of the much-hyped
wannabe &ldquo;Media OS&rdquo;, BeOS, which sank without a splash while the
real media devices, such as TiVo and Moxi, went Linux.</p><p>When I told Greg about the new Cypress USB chip, the SL811HS,
and the driver for it that Cypress is releasing under GPL, his
first reaction was that he was glad Cypress has &ldquo;a clue&rdquo;. It
looks like a very useful part, too. It does both host and slave, so
you could plug a PDA into your computer to sync files and plug USB
peripherals, such as a mouse or keyboard, into the PDA later. Try
one.</p><p>For those of you developing for desktop or server Linux, why
make your users sit around and get carpal tunnel syndrome when they
could be using a convenient embedded device where the real work (or
fun) is? Or better yet, why not cut the user out of the boring
stuff altogether and let the machine deal with the real world? Your
software will effectively accomplish more in an &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; device
than in the server room or office. Same goes for your web site. Try
it on a Zaurus today.</p><p>But back to the clue part. Embedded Linux isn't just a
shrink-wrap package that says &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; on it. It's a standard
generic platform with a thorough collection of drivers that's
growing every day (thanks Cypress), distributed under a license
that lets you get some work done. Just like regular Linux, embedded
systems are good software for clueful people.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An embedded system doesn't need system
administration.</p></li><li><p>It comes with the application pre-installed. You
don't have to install additional software to get something
done.</p></li><li><p>It's responsive. Many embedded systems have formal
real-time requirements, but even those that don't at least don't
make you wait for silly things like fdisk.</p></li><li><p>It interfaces with the real world, not just the
network and a carpal-tunnel-slaying keyboard and mouse.</p></li><li><p>It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity,
remorse or fear!</p></li><li><p>And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you
are dead!</p></li></ol></div><p>No, wait, the last two are &ldquo;The Terminator&rdquo;, not all
embedded systems. But you get the idea. Embedded systems are what
software wants to be when it grows up, and &ldquo;regular Linux&rdquo; is
headed in the same direction.
