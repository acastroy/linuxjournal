    This article provides a technical tutorial on setting up IPv6 on a
    Linux server and connecting it to the IPv6 Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bb2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The current version of the IP protocol,
IPv4, has proved to be robust, easily implemented, interoperable
and has stood the test of scaling to the size of today's Internet,
most of which uses IPv4&mdash;now nearly 20 years old. IPv4 has been
remarkably resilient in spite of its age, but it is beginning to
have problems. The initial design of IPv4 did not take into
consideration several issues that are of great importance today,
such as a large address space providing a solution for the address
crunch problem, mobility, security, autoconfiguration and quality
of service.
</p><p>To address these concerns, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) has developed a suite of protocols and standards known
as the IP version 6 (IPv6), which incorporates many of the concepts
and proposed methods for updating IPv4. Some of the IPv6 features
include a new header format, a larger address space (128 bits), an
efficient and hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure,
the availability of stateless and stateful address security,
built-in security, better support of mobility and a new protocol
for neighboring node interaction. As a result, IPv6 is not only
going to fix a number of problems in IPv4, it also will add many
improvements. IPv6 is expected to replace IPv4 gradually, with the
two coexisting for a number of years during a transition
period.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bb450"></a>Linux IPv6 Implementations</h2></div></div><p>There are two main IPv6 implementations for Linux: the
implementation that comes as part of the Linux kernel and the USAGI
(UniverSAl playGround for IPv6) implementation. The USAGI Project
works to deliver a production-quality IPv6 protocol stack for
Linux, tightly collaborating with the WIDE, KAME and TAHI Projects.
It is run by volunteers from various organizations contributing to
the Linux and the IPv6 communities via the delivery of the IPv6
protocol stack. Currently, there are many efforts in the different
distributions teams, and USAGI is trying to unify them so that
there is one IPv6 implementation for all Linux
distributions.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, we use Linux kernel 2.4.5
from <a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>. We first
show how to build a kernel with IPv6 support, then how to upgrade
the basic networking software to support IPv6 and finally, how to
connect your IPv6-enabled server to the IPv6 Internet using the
services from the
<a href="http://www.freenet6.net" target="_self">www.freenet6.net</a>
Project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bb660"></a>Supporting IPv6 in the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The first step is to download the Linux kernel from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a> and uncompress
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf linux-2.4.5.tar.gz
</pre><p>You will have a directory called linux. You need to move this
directory into /usr/src and rename it linux-2.4.5 to reflect the
kernel version. Next, you need to create a link to the 2.4.5 source
directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.4.5 /usr/src/linux
</pre>


Having done that, you need to configure the new kernel to enable
support for IPv6:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux
make xconfig (or menuconfig)
</pre>


We need to enable two options in the kernel configuration. First,
go to Code Maturity Level and enable development/incomplete
code/drivers:
<pre     class="programlisting">
"Prompt for development and/or incomplete
   code/drivers"    YES
</pre>


</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Enabling Support for Experimental
Features</p></div></div>
</p><p>Then go to the Networking Options. There you will enable the
IPv6 protocol:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IPv6 Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)    YES
</pre><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Linux Kernel IPv6
Configuration</p></div></div>
</p><p>This is all the configuration you need at the kernel level.
Next, you should save this configuration and exit by clicking on
the Save and Exit button (see Figure 3). This will create a .config
file in /usr/src/linux, which is the kernel configuration file. Now
you are ready to compile the kernel by following these
steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make clean
make dep
make bzImage
</pre><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4763f3.large.jpg"><img src="4763f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Saving the Configuration</p></div></div>
</p><p>The result will be a new kernel image created in
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/. If you added other features as
modules you need to compile and install the modules by
applying:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules
make modules_install
</pre><p>At this point you need to copy the new IPv6-enabled boot
image to /boot:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage
    /boot/bzImage.ipv6
</pre>


and update your System.map file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map \
/boot/System.map-2.4.5-ipv6
ln -fs /boot/System.map-2.4.5-ipv6 /boot/System.map
</pre>


The only remaining step is to update /etc/lilo.conf file to add an
entry for the new IPv6-enabled kernel. Edit the /etc/lilo.conf file
and add a new entry as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
image=/boot/bzImage.ipv6
label=linux_ipv6
root=/dev/hda1 # change this to reflect your own
               # partition
read-only
</pre>


Then update the LILO configuration by applying
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/lilo
</pre>


This will add an entry called linux_ipv6 that will be presented at
LILO at boot time. You are now ready to reboot your server. When
LILO comes up, choose to boot linux_ipv6. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Et
voil&agrave;</em></span>! Your system will boot with IPv6 support in
the kernel. Type <b  >ifconfig</b> at the prompt to
verify and see the outcome. It should show the IPv6 local address
::1 in your loopback configuration (see Figure 4).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bc5d8"></a>IPv6 Binaries and Tools</h2></div></div><p>Once the kernel supports IPv6, you need to install some tools
to test your setup and to use IPv6 transport with other systems.
First, you need the basic network utilities to support IPv6 to be
able to configure your interface, in addition to some other IP
utilities such as ping6, telnet6, etc., and to be able to do some
basic IPv6 testing.</p><p>There are three packages that provide these utilities:
net-tools, iputils and the NetKit utilities. The must-have packages
are the first two; NetKit is optional. In addition, if you want to
have the ability to debug potential IPv6 network problems that may
arise, you need to have support for IPv6 in tcpdump and libpcap. In
the following sections, we cover the installation of all the
above-mentioned packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bc738"></a>net-tools</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>net-tools</b></span> is a collection of
programs to control Linux's networking, which includes commands
such as arp, hostname (domainname, dnsdomainname, nisdomainname),
ifconfig, ipmaddr, iptunnel, netstat, rarp, route and plipconfig.
This package is available for download from
<a href="http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/net-tools" target="_self">www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/net-tools</a>.</p><p>To install the package on your system first download the
packages directly into /usr/src. Then enter these commands
separately:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src
tar xIvf net-tools-1.60.tar.bz2
cd net-tools-1.60
./configure.sh config.in
</pre><p>The configuration will ask a few questions that you need to
answer to be able to configure net-tools. It is suggested that you
answer yes to the following questions:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INET6 (IPv6) protocol family (HAVE_AFINET6) [n]    y
SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) support (HAVE_HWSIT) [n]        y
Build iptunnel and ipmaddr (HAVE_IP_TOOLS) [n]     y
</pre>


Then, you need to compile and install net-tools:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make
make install
</pre>


The binaries will be installed in /sbin and /bin, and you can start
using them assuming that you have rebooted into an IPv6-enabled
kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x20bcaa8"></a>iputils</h2></div></div><p>This package includes the following tools: ping, ping6,
traceroute6, rdisc, clockdiff, tftpd, tracepath, tracepath6 and
arping. It may be that the installed IP utilities on your system do
not support IPv6. The first step is to check if the currently
installed version is IPv6-compliant by typing the following at the
command shell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q --qf "%{NAME}-%{VERSION}\n" iputils
</pre><p>If the outcome is iputils-20000121 or newer, then you do not
need to perform the installation of the latest iputils package.
Otherwise, you need to follow these steps to install the utilities
on your system. First, download the package from
<a href="ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing" target="_self">ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing</a>.
For our setup, we used iputils-ss001110.tar.gz. Next, untar the
package in /usr/src:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf iputils-ss001110.tar.gz
</pre>


Finally, compile iputils with <b  >make</b>.
</p><p>The package does not provide a make install. Therefore, you
are free to place the binaries in a directory of your choice.
However, you need to make sure that the old versions of the tools
you have do not conflict with the newer versions in your path. Save
the new binaries in /usr/local/iputils/bin/. The package provides
man pages for every tool. You also need to move the new man pages
into a directory that man searches; to check which directories are
in the man path, type <b  >manpath</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b5068"></a>NetKit Utilities</h2></div></div><p>These utilities are basic tools to work with and test your
new IPv6 configuration. NetKit includes the following tools: ping,
finger, telnet, rwho and their respective d&aelig;mons. These are
very useful utilities because we can compile them with IPv6
support. The package is available for download from
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/netkit" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/netkit</a>.
The version we tested was nkit-0.5.1.tar.gz.</p><p>Here are the steps you need to follow to install these
utilities on your Linux server. First, download the latest NetKit
package from the referenced web site. Then move the downloaded file
to /usr/src. Unpack the package with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf nkit-0.5.1.tar.gz
</pre><p>Next, run <b  >./configure</b>. Compile with
<b  >make clean</b> and <b  >make</b>, and copy
the binaries to /usr/local/bin:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp telnet/telnet /usr/local/bin/telnet6
cp telnetd/in.telnetd /usr/local/sbin/in.telnetd6
cp finger/finger /usr/local/bin/finger6
cp ping/ping /usr/local/bin/ping6
cp fingerd/in.fingerd /usr/local/sbin/in.fingerd6
</pre>


At this moment, you should have basic functionalities, as you can,
for instance, ping6 your local IPv6 loopback (Figure 5).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. ping6 in Action
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Please note that if you are using Red Hat 7.x, you need to
apply a patch to the NetKit package. The patch is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.bieringer.de/pub/linux/IPv6/netkit" target="_self">ftp.bieringer.de/pub/linux/IPv6/netkit</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b5698"></a>Optional Utilities</h2></div></div><p>There are several optional utilities that you can install on
your system that extend their support for IPv6. For the purpose of
this article we mention only three packages: libpcap, tcpdump and
xinetd.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b57a0"></a>libpcap and tcpdump</h2></div></div><p>If you need to understand what is happening at the packet
level of your IPv6 network/connection, you need to have IPv6 with
libpcap and tcpdump. <span   class="bold"><b>libpcap</b></span> is a
system-independent interface for user-level packet capture that
provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring. On
the other hand, tcpdump is a tool that provides network monitoring
and data acquisition.</p><p>If you want these functionalities, you need to download the
latest versions and install them on your system. The versions we
tested were tcpdump 3.6.2 and libpcap 0.6.2. First, download the
packages from
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org" target="_self">www.tcpdump.org</a> and
move them to /usr/src. Then unpack them with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf libpcap-0.6.2.tar.gz
tar -xzf tcpdump-3.6.2.tar.gz
</pre><p>After unpacking, you will have two directories, one for each
package. Next, you need to follow these steps for each package;
however, you need to apply them first to libpcap and then to
tcpdump. First, run the configuration script while enabling IPv6:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --enable-ipv6
</pre>


Then compile with <b  >make clean</b> and
<b  >make</b>. Lastly, install the binaries with
<b  >make install</b>.
</p><p>After following these steps, you need to adjust your path to
include the new binaries that support IPv6. You also may want to
edit /etc/profile and include /usr/local/sbin and /usr/local/bin
within your PATH variable, and reload /etc/profile for the new
changes to take effect:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
source /etc/profile
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b5c70"></a>xinetd with IPv6 Support</h2></div></div><p>If you want to be able to telnet6 to your system, you need to
compile xinetd with inet6 support. Normally, the installed inetd
d&aelig;mon isn't ready to handle IPv6 addresses. Therefore, you
need to upgrade to xinetd. To download the latest version of xinetd
go to
<a href="http://synack.net/xinetd" target="_self">synack.net/xinetd</a>.
Our setup was tested with xinetd-2.1.8.8p3.tar.gz.</p><p>Download xinetd-2.1.8.8p3.tar.gz (or latest) into /usr/src
and unpack it with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf xinetd-2.1.8.8p3.tar.gz
</pre><p>Next, run the configuration script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --with-inet6 --prefix=/usr/local/bin
</pre>


The <b  >--prefix=/usr/local/bin</b> is used to specify that the resulting
binaries should go under /usr/local/bin. Then compile and install:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make clean
make
make install
</pre>


Next, you need to create a configuration file from your old
inet.conf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/xconv.pl &lt; /etc/inetd.conf &gt; /etc/xinetd.conf
</pre>


where /usr/sbin is the path to the xinetd executable.
</p><p>As a side note, you need to make sure that in the xconv.pl
script, the first line contains the right path to the Perl binary
to be able to execute.</p><p>Next, you need do some very minor changes in /etc/xinetd.conf
to reflect the usage of the telnet6d and tftp6d, instead of the
usual IPv4 Telnet and TFTP d&aelig;mons. Having done that, you will
be set to Telnet and FTP to your system over IPv6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b60e8"></a>IPv6 Applications</h2></div></div><p>There is a wide range of applications that support IPv6.
However, we are going to mention only one server application, the
Apache web server. Apache is the most popular web server on the
Internet (source:
<a href="http://Netcraft.com" target="_self">Netcraft.com</a>). The latest
beta release, Apache 2.0.16 beta, includes support for IPv6, which
makes it a good application for testing your IPv6 setup. If you
download the latest version of the Apache web server and install it
on your system, you will be able to serve web pages over
IPv6.</p><p>Figure 6 presents a screenshot of the Mozilla browser when
trying to access &ldquo;http://[::1], which is the IPv6 local
loopback.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. A Request for ::1</p></div></div>
</p><p>For your convenience, you may want to update /etc/hosts file
to include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
::1     ip6-localhost   ip6-localhost
</pre><p>Then, instead of using ::1, you can use ip6-localhost.
</p><p>Don't forget to check the /etc/protocols. If the
below-mentioned entries are not there, you need to append them for
IPv6-protocol support:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

done, there was an interest in having a test backbone for IPv6.
During IETF-Montr&eacute;al in 1996, the 6bone (IPv6 backbone) was
born. It uses test (but still valid) addresses in the 3ffe::/16
range. At the beginning, most of the backbone was done using
tunnels over the current IPv4 Internet. This makes a virtual IPv6
network over the IPv4 Internet. Nowadays, the 6bone is made of both
native links and tunnel links. The 6bone is there for testing, so
there is no service-level agreement between the organizations, but
this doesn't mean it is not reliable or valid. Any traffic from and
to 3ffe::/16 is valid without any limitation.</p><p>In July 1999, the three regional registries, ARIN for
Americas, RIPE for Europe and Africa and APNIC for Asia, started to
give regular nontest addresses to providers, starting in the
2001::/16 range. All the sites that have addresses from that range
form the production IPv6 Internet.</p><p>To connect to either the 6bone or the IPv6 Internet, you need
(as in IPv4) a provider that offers the service. If you can't find
one directly, or if your current one does not offer the service,
then the easy solution is to make a tunnel to a provider or a site
that is willing to offer you the transit service.</p><p>As in the early days of the Internet, a project aimed to help
people start using IPv6 is offering a free and automated tunnel
service that can connect any individual or organization to the IPv6
Internet. The project is called Freenet6.net and is run by
Viag&eacute;nie, a consulting firm, as a free, volunteer and
run-on-a-best-effort basis. The service is very popular in the
community because of the easy and fast access to the
Internet.</p><p>Freenet6 is modeled from the tunnel broker (RFC 3053) where
an IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel is established between a node and the
tunnel broker. Freenet6 is an enhanced version where the node is
using a tunnel setup protocol (TSP) to negotiate the establishment
of the tunnel with the server. The client node may be a host or a
router. The TSP server Freenet6 provides not only tunnels but also
a large address space to any user of the service. The address space
provided is a /48, which gives (16 bits) 65,536 subnets, each may
have up to 264 nodes (64 bits). This is much more than the entire
current Internet! This address space is assigned to the user and
will survive over a change in the IPv4 address of the client node.
This enables any user or organization to have the freedom of
billions of addresses for servers and services; this was not easy
to do with NAT in IPv4.</p><p>An IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel is made with both end points
configuring the IPv4 and the IPv6 address of the other end point.
When one of the end points changes its IPv4 address, then both end
points of the tunnel need to change their configuration
accordingly. This is especially cumbersome when the IPv4 node is
doing dial-up or changing addresses often. TSP, as implemented in
the Freenet6 service, can be configured to take care of this. Each
time the tunnel client changes its IPv4 address, for example, at
boot time with DHCP service, the TSP client sends updated and
authenticated information to the server, so the tunnel remains
active. Supported client nodes of the Freenet6 service are Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Windows, Solaris and Cisco. Figure 7
illustrates the basic architecture of Freenet6.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4763f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Freenet6 Architecture with One Host
</p></div></div><p>To use the Freenet6 service after installing IPv6 on Linux,
you have to take the following steps. First, go to
<a href="http://www.freenet6.net" target="_self">www.freenet6.net</a> and
register a user name. Then download the TSP client for Linux.
Follow the instructions for compiling and installing it. Next,
configure the tspc.conf file provided. Add your user name and
password. Then start the tspc client:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tspc -vf tspc.conf
</pre><p>You may want to put the tspc client command in your boot
sequence so that it will automatically re-enable the tunnel at boot
time, even if your IPv4 address changes.
</p><p>Freenet6 can give you either one IPv6 address if you have a
host, or it can give you a full /48 if you have a router. Freenet6
will configure Linux to fit the role.</p><p>In the router case, you will receive a /48, and the first
subnet on your router will be configured for router advertisements.
This means that hosts on that subnet will receive the prefix and
autoconfigure themselves, as shown in Figure 8.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4763f8.large.jpg"><img src="4763f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Freenet6 Architecture with a Router and Multiple Hosts
</p></div></div><p>There are many ways to connect to the IPv6 Internet.
Freenet6, together with the TSP protocol, enables an easy
IPv6-tunneled connection with a permanent address space so that if
you change your IPv4 address, the IPv6 addresses and connection
remains stable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b6f00"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>As part of our activities in the Open Architecture Research
at Ericsson Research Canada, we are conducting several IPv6-related
projects, such as supporting IPv6 on our telecom-grade server
nodes, porting application servers to work with IPv6 and
establishing research projects in different IPv6 areas.</p><p>One of the interesting activities we carried out was to
experiment with the Linux IPv6 implementations currently available
and present recommendations to decide which implementation to adopt
for our Linux processors. The recommendations were based on
IPv6-implementation characteristics, such as its development speed,
its compliance to the standards and its performance vs. other
implementations. The results were presented during the Linux
Symposium in Ottawa, Canada, June 26-29
(<a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2002/view_txt.php?text=abstract&amp;talk=93" target="_self">www.linuxsymposium.org/2002/view_txt.php?text=abstract&amp;talk=93</a>).</p><p>For 2002, we continue to support IPv6 on our Linux clusters.
Our current efforts are in the direction of supporting IPv6 on the
SIP and SCTP implementations for Linux, as well as building an IPv6
benchmarking environment capable of testing the performance and
scalability of platforms and applications running over IPv6.</p><p>In closing, it's important to know that one of the key
advantages of IPv6 is addresses. Any individual can receive as many
addresses as the current IPv4 address space. This empowers users
with complete freedom to deploy servers and services without having
to take care of NAT problems and limited address space. Welcome to
the freedom of deploying services on the Internet!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc3580.0x24b7168"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>We'd like to thank Ericsson Open Architecture Research for
