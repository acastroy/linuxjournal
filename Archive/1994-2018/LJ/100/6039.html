    HP to Hardware Vendors: Peddle That NDA Somewhere Else
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce6580.0x1dde0e0"></a>HP to Hardware Vendors: Peddle That NDA
Somewhere Else</h2></div></div><p>Bruce Perens, Linux czar of Hewlett-Packard, has what he
calls a &ldquo;very good&rdquo; chance of getting a preference for
Linux-compatible hardware made into corporate policy at the new
largest Linux vendor, the merged HP/Compaq.</p><p>The policy would mandate a company-wide &ldquo;at design-in time,
preference for devices that have publicly documented
interfaces&rdquo;.</p><p>For HP engineers, it means that if you have a choice between
two hardware products, select the one for which an open-source
driver exists or for which the vendor publishes programming
information. If a part comes with a nondisclosure agreement, don't
use it unless there's no alternative, or the alternative would be
prohibitively expensive.</p><p>How much less will NDA-shrouded hardware be worth to HP?
Perens doesn't put a number on it. Or, to look at it the other way,
how much of a price premium will HP be willing to pay to use a
publicly documented device? The advice to designers is &ldquo;use your
head&rdquo;, he says.</p><p>&ldquo;I was concerned about graphics display chips&rdquo;, Perens
said. ATI's low-end graphics hardware is fairly clean, but at the
high end, &ldquo;They're all crazy&rdquo;, he said. The policy has already
resulted in HP dropping NDA-covered modem chips for openly
documented ones.</p><p>Although the documented hardware policy was approved at a
&ldquo;corporate policy level&rdquo; within HP before the merger and was
ready to become the standard within the company, Perens has to get
management of the new, merged company to approve it all over again.
&ldquo;The merger has held off a lot of things, and I have to get
[Compaq managers] to be cognizant of the reason we need it&rdquo;, he
said.</p><p>Just because HP laptops and PDAs will be Linux-friendly
doesn't mean the company will formally support Linux on them. There
are no plans to offer a Linux laptop or to commercialize Jim
Gettys' work on running Linux and X on the Compaq-now-HP
iPAQ.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of what I'm doing with Linux is servers&rdquo;, Perens
said. The merger's overall effect on Linux at HP and Compaq?
&ldquo;Unless something awful happens it should make it better.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce6580.0x1dde4a8"></a>Hot and Cool Linux Dot-Com Actually Makes
Money</h2></div></div><p>HOTorNOT.com offers a simple and democratic answer to a
common but embarrassing question: how good do I look? Voters play a
kind of whack-a-mole, only they whack human beings instead of moles
and use a mouse instead of a mallet, rating each candidate on scale
of 1 to 10. As soon as one gets rated, another pops up next to a
thumbnail of the last one, with the current rating.</p><p>The site was conceived in October 2000 by James Young and Jim
Hong, a couple of 27-year-old Berkeley-trained hackers, roommates
and drinking buddies. They were going to put it up on XMethods,
their web site for publicly available web services.</p><p>For what instantly became obvious reasons, they made
<a href="http://HOTorNOT.com" target="_self">HOTorNOT.com</a> an
independent site. In just over a week, the site was getting almost
two million page views per day. By May of this year, HOTorNOT had
counted over 2.1 billion votes and had over one million user
accounts.</p><p>But here's what's really hot: it runs on Linux. &ldquo;In fact&rdquo;,
James Hong recently told us, &ldquo;we couldn't have done it without
Linux.&rdquo; By &ldquo;it&rdquo;, he means make money. According to Hong,
HOTorNOT pulls in more than enough income to pay for itself and its
staff, which still consists of the original two guys.</p><p>That's because they've adapted quickly. &ldquo;When the
advertising business began to crash, we added a paid 'meeting'
service to the system.&rdquo; The result was countless dating success
stories, including more than a few marriages. But the most
important success story is HOTorNOT's own.</p><p>&ldquo;HOTorNOT is a viable business built entirely on Linux&rdquo;,
Hong says. More specifically, &ldquo;Linux (Red Hat), Apache, MySQL and
PHP on 35 1U rackmounts, mostly from Rackable Systems.&rdquo; (See
picture.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6039hotf1.jpg"></div><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce6580.0x1dde920"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;August

LynxOS</h2></div></div><p>The Royal Danish Navy is going to sea with applications
developed on Linux but running on the Linux-compatible, real-time
LynxOS from LynuxWorks
(<a href="http://lynuxworks.com" target="_self">lynuxworks.com</a>). &ldquo;The
Linux interfaces are becoming the real-world definition of open
systems&rdquo;, said Dr. Inder Singh, LynuxWorks' CEO.</p><p>&ldquo;LynxOS is very unique in being a hard real-time operating
system that is ABI-compatible with Linux&rdquo;, he added. The Royal
Danish Navy doesn't even need to recompile to move applications
from Linux-based development systems onshore to the LynxOS platform
on ship.</p><p>LynxOS has been on the market for more than a decade and was
designed into Space Station Freedom before the project was
re-organized as the International Space Station. It is also used in
Airbus jets. On the ground, LynxOS is also used on HP LaserJet
printers and Xerox copiers.</p><p>&ldquo;Requirements for certification are pretty strenuous&rdquo;,
Singh said. Extensive documentation is required, and no Linux-based
system has yet been certified for real-time space or military use.
&ldquo;There have been many attempts, but no one has been able to get
one certified&rdquo;, Singh said.</p><p>Observers of Linux's inexorable progress add, &ldquo;Yet&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce6580.0x21d80c0"></a>Stop the Presses: Commons, 2; Hollywood,
0</h2></div></div><p>The entertainment industry's war with technology goes back a
long way. In 1984, MPAA Chairman Jack Valenti said, &ldquo;The VCR is to
the American film producer and the American public what the Boston
Strangler is to a woman home alone.&rdquo; But we can trace the current
system of fears and balances back to 1908, when music publishers
claimed player piano rolls violated music copyrights. That case
lost in the Supreme Court, but the industry prevailed on Congress
to establish the &ldquo;mechanical license&rdquo;, which established the
right to reproduce published music in return for a regulated
royalty. In 1931 some music composers claimed that a hotel's radio
station violated copyrights by playing their music. The composers
lost that one. In the 1960s, book publishers failed in their suit
against photocopiers, but the Supreme Court ruling on the case
allowed &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; of published works. In the late 1960s and
early 1970s, broadcasters took on Community Antenna Television or
CATV. (The movie industry was also involved, forcing theater
employees to wear buttons that said &ldquo;Fight Pay TV&rdquo;.) Supreme
Court rulings on two cases opened the way for the cable TV systems
we have today. So it's clear we're still in this fight for the very
long haul.</p><p>But at least we can pause to observe two current victories
for technology over those who would control it: the launch of
Creative Commons and the Librarian of Congress' rejection of CARP's
(Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel) recommendations for imposing
stiff requirements and performance use fees on internet radio
stations.</p><p>Creative Commons
(<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_self">www.creativecommons.org</a>)
was launched at the O'Reilly Emerging Technologies Conference in
Santa Clara, California, on May 16, ending months of quiet
development. It is led by Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law professor
and author of two highly influential works (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future of
Ideas</em></span>), both of which argue against the entertainment
industry's constant campaign to bend copyright law in their favor
and to replace the Internet's commons with a highly regulated
system for the supply-controlled distribution of
&ldquo;content&rdquo;.</p><p>The project lives at Stanford University, where it is highly
involved with the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and
Society. It also receives what it calls &ldquo;generous support&rdquo; from
the Center for the Public Domain (formerly the Red Hat Center),
which is headquartered at Duke University and chaired by Red Hat
founder Bob Young.</p><p>Rather than simply lobbying against the entertainment
industry, Creative Commons offers concrete solutions to the first
sources of creative goods: the artists themselves. In his speech to
the conference Lessig said,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This content that the law says is mine, I should
be able to make available on my own terms. We need machine-readable
expressions of the author's intentions about the nature of the
content. The world should not be divided between those who believe
in control and those who believe in access. Those who want both, on
an individual level, should be able to compromise.</p></blockquote></div><p>While Creative Commons was in development, internet radio,
which includes thousands of stations (many of them making
resourceful use of Linux and other open-source software), was under
severe threat by the CARP's recommendations, which were issued in
February 2002 and widely expected to knock most stations off the
air. If adopted, the CARP recommendations would have become
regulatory fact on May 22, 2002. But on May 21, the Librarian of
Congress issued an &ldquo;order rejecting the panel's determination&rdquo;,
which would become final one month later. Stations and advocacy
groups like SaveInternetRadio.org breathed a public sigh of relief.
</p><p>But the issue is far from resolved. CARP is a creature
spawned by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which is still in
force. More importantly, the whole idea of the Commons is still not
well understood&mdash;especially on Capitol Hill, where the influence of
the entertainment industry remains enormous.</p><p>In his speech Larry Lessig said, &ldquo;We will never succeed in
advocating the importance of this space until ordinary people get
it. And they won't until technologists begin to express to
politicians how important these values that they built into
technology are to freedom and creativity.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce6580.0x21d8640"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>Today, if you've got end-to-end encrypted mail going in and
