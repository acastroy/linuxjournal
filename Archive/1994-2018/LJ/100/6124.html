<i  >Linux Journal</i> for writing the &ldquo;Emacs: the
Free Software IDE&rdquo; article in the June 2002 issue. I've been using
XEmacs for four years for my programming projects, and Charles'
article opened my eyes to a bunch of options I wasn't even aware
of. I guess I'll be spending the next couple of weeks (or months)
going through the Emacs documentation to see what else is lurking
in the 20MB of source code. Thank you <i  >LJ</i> for
publishing such an informative (and well-written) article.</p><p>&mdash;Robert James Kaes</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x250d580.0x2605348"></a>Humor in Advertising</h2></div></div><p>It's great that you can afford to spend an entire page on
humor, even though it's not the April issue. And it's even that
dry, sarcastic humor that you usually find only in British
publications. I'm referring, of course, to the Compaq ad parody on
page 51 of your June 2002 issue, where they brag about being such
an early adopter of Linux when &ldquo;their&rdquo; employee, a Mr. Jon
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, ported Linux to &ldquo;their&rdquo; Alpha system. And how
&ldquo;they&rdquo; funded and otherwise supported Linus as early as
1994.</p><p>As a matter of fact, wasn't Mr. Hall employed by DEC in 1994,
when he ported Linux and helped to get funding for Linus to support
the Alpha architecture? In 1994, wasn't Compaq, as well as Dell and
all the other major OEMs, claiming that no one wanted a Linux
system?</p><p>I realize that Compaq now owns all the assets of DEC and that
marketing people have no shame, but if this ad is believable,
perhaps I should be able to buy a Picasso and then claim that I
painted it.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Peterson</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall replies:</b></span> <i  >Linux Journal</i> was kind enough to allow me
to answer your Letter to the Editor.</p><p>No one felt worse about the demise of Digital Equipment
Corporation and its purchase by Compaq than I did. I had used DEC
products since 1969, and it was on a PDP-8 through the use of a DEC
training manual that I taught myself assembly language programming.
When I was the Department Head of Data Processing at Hartford State
Technical College, DEC repaired my PDP-11/70 for free because it
had taken them so long to find the problem, and the school had no
budget that year for the &ldquo;time and materials&rdquo; it would have taken
to fix it. Later I learned UNIX and was system administrator to six
VAX 11/780 machines at Bell Laboratories.</p><p>Through the years I got to know a lot about DEC culture and
its commitment to its customers. As part of this commitment I was
involved with DECUS, and from the DECUS members (Kurt Reisler, in
particular) learned about Linux. Digital Equipment Corporation was
more than a company, it was a family.</p><p>Yes, I was working for Digital at the time that the Alpha
Project was started. Yes, it was several years before Compaq bought
Digital. Yes, I felt a pang as Compaq took over Digital's role as
the &ldquo;first system vendor to join Linux International&rdquo; (even
before VA).</p><p>On the other hand, to deny Compaq the right to that claim
denies the work that the people who still are employed by Compaq
(or should I say HP?) did at that time. I know that Maurice Marks,
who basically funded the Alpha Linux work in the first days is
still at the &ldquo;new HP&rdquo;. Jay Estabrook (Hi Jay!) who did a lot of
the low-level porting work is also still there, helping to continue
support of the Alpha with Linux. The Alpha high-performance group,
who started some of the first commercially available Beowulf
clusters is still working away. The Digital compiler group, who
ported their compiler technology to Alpha Linux is still (to my
knowledge) working away. There were many, many people besides me
who contributed their time and expertise, paid and unpaid, employee
and customer, to the Alpha Linux Project. They did it because of
the love of Linux and the love of Digital. They did it both with
the support of their upper management and sometimes in spite of
it.</p><p>To deny them their role in the support of Linux just because
their company now has a new name is not fair either.</p><p>And if Compaq does not claim the right to say that they
supported Linux first, who does? Digital Equipment Corporation is
no more, and all the wishing to bring it back will not make a bit
of difference. Soon I will expect to see Hewlett-Packard take up
the mantle. And now, to set the record straight, a lot of other
companies had people supporting Linux early on. Sun supported David
Miller to do Linux porting work to Sparc. Compaq had people in
Houston who helped to write device drivers and do porting. I know
there were people at IBM and HP who were also doing Linux work. But
for one reason or another the cultures of their companies did not
allow them to have the visibility that Digital's culture allowed
me.</p><p>In 1998, when a lot of companies held up their hands to say
&ldquo;they supported Linux&rdquo; a lot of people were able to come &ldquo;out of
the closet&rdquo;, but that does not mean those people were not active
before. I had just come out a little sooner, and with a little more
fanfare. Then again, I have never been a shrinking violet.</p><p>The world of computer company buyouts and mergers creates
little tricks in time and space, and we should learn to live with
them. A friend of mine, David Mosberger, who did a lot of work on
Alpha Linux, recently wanted to return an Alpha system lent to him
by Digital in 1995. But he did not know who to return it to, since
Digital no longer existed. I told him to just hold on to it, and
that things will be made right again. You see, for the last several
years David has worked for Hewlett-Packard. His system is back home
again.</p><p>The bottom line of this is that if I were writing a history
book, I would mention the contributions of Wang, Prime and a host
of other defunct computer companies like Digital Equipment
Corporation. But I live in the here and now, so the current company
that supported Linux in 1994 is Hewlett (n&eacute;e Compaq,
n&eacute;e DEC) Packard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x250d580.0x2605978"></a>Trivial Correction</h2></div></div><p>Regarding the June 2002 issue, page 8, trivia question
1&mdash;please lay this myth to rest. Yes, Grace Hopper did find a moth
in a relay. That log page is now in the Smithsonian Institute, I
believe. But &ldquo;bug&rdquo; in the current sense has been around since
Thomas Edison's days. See

Letter to the Editor came to us written by hand on a sheet of
yellow legal pad paper.</p><p>From the Desks of Adrian and Mike: We understand that yours
is a magazine that would like to appeal to Linux enthusiasts.
Therefore, we have some suggestions regarding your fluffy
layout:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use fixed-sized, monospaced font throughout the
entire publication. All pictures must be represented as ASCII art
or PostScript files, and there must be no color. You've got black;
you've got white. What more do you need?</p></li><li><p>The cover should not contain anything but the title
and the date.</p></li><li><p>The binding should be staples and not glue, which
is bad for the environment and embarrassingly corporate.</p></li><li><p>All type must be printed with high-impact printers
to give each page a unique and profound texture.</p></li><li><p>You should change the name of your magazine from
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Kernel</em></span> and, under no circumstances, write about anything
that is not a part of or that cannot be directly compiled into the
kernel.</p></li><li><p>There is no need to use English for all the
articles. C and Bourne shell scripts are languages much more
recognized by the global Linux community.</p></li><li><p>We could go on for pages but feel strongly that if
you just covered the first 6, just a half a dozen honest,
down-to-earth and from-the-heart suggestions, your circulation
would multiply by a factor of ten (we know we would by ten issues
each month just cause they were that cool); your revenues would
skyrocket, never mind the inherent irony about the relationship
between your capitalist intentions and the brilliant and
revolutionary open-source model that Linux embraces, and, not to
mention, we'd buy you beer.</p></li></ol></div><p>&mdash;Adrian and Mike
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x250d580.0x2606370"></a>Social Destruction</h2></div></div><p>On a whim I was reading Harriet Beecher Stowe's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em></span> today. I was struck by how,
at the time, abolitionists were considered socially destructive
extremists&mdash;and the South's reflexive reaction was censorship. The
essence of freedom is freedom of thought and creativity, bounded by
essential (not submissive!) respect for others. I believe that,
perhaps in 50 years, perhaps 2,000 years, but with the same
certainty that humanity will survive, intellectual property will
come to be regarded with the same revulsion and embarrassment as
human beings as property.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen Schaefer</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x250d580.0x2606528"></a>Protocol Problems</h2></div></div><p>The Linux for Suits column, &ldquo;The Protocol Problem&rdquo;, by Doc
Searls in the July 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, was of interest to me because it is an issue
that I think we are seeing several major issues start to develop
around. There seems to be an overwhelming amount of &ldquo;If all you
have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&rdquo; mentality going
around, at least insofar as trying to put nearly the entire world
on top of IP&mdash;this is only making, what Doc Searls referred to as
&ldquo;the gating factor&rdquo;, worse.</p><p>As technology develops, the lower layers of the technology
become more and more abstracted and hidden from the upper layers.
Right now, it is doubtful if many people care or concern themselves
with whether their IP packets ride over fiber or copper, the
particular framing or link-level protocols being used, etc. Because
we can connect fiber and copper and wireless networks together, we
are not limited by the individual mediums.</p><p>Eventually, this is what is going to have to happen with IP
and any other protocols occupying this space&mdash;the &ldquo;end-to-end
(network) protocol&rdquo; mentality must give way to the &ldquo;end-to-end
application&rdquo; mentality. One day, eventually, the IP network will
be replaced by something else. It's going to happen&mdash;but the
general mentality seems to be that an IP network
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be IP end to end. Building for that,
designing for that, that attitude will slow down the deployment of
any future protocol technology...like IPv6.</p><p>One day, just as most people do not care whether their data
are going end-to-end over a particular physical media (as long as
the desired quality of service parameters are met), they will not
care about the network protocol. When data networks are not an
&ldquo;IP-only&rdquo; club where only IP through-and-through networks can
play, but a true inter-net (as opposed to the current IP Internet,
which is more of a giant shared-address space Intranet) where the
intra-net protocols may all be different, then the barriers will be
gone. Organizations will be freer to develop and deploy new
protocols and technologies internally without getting ostracized by
their peers for being different.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x250d580.0x26067e8"></a>Erratum</h2></div></div><p>In my interview in the June 2002 issue, my affiliation was
mistakenly listed as &ldquo;Director of PythonLabs&rdquo; rather than the
correct &ldquo;Director of PythonLabs at Zope Corporation&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Guido van Rossum</p></div></div>
