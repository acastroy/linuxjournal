    Why the Progress and NuSphere vs. MySQL AB litigation is about sloppy deal making, not open-source integrity.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27be450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many describe a new continuing lawsuit in
federal court in Boston as &ldquo;The first litigation testing the
validity and enforceability of the General Public License&rdquo; (GPL).
So what?
</p><p>Will this litigation really impact the future of Linux
programmers? Does this dispute matter for companies betting their
business models on the open-source trend? Will the judge get the
chance to punish an arrogant American software vendor that broke
the long-known rules of GNU and thereby defend the OSS cause, as
some OSS advocates have suggested?</p><p>Sorry, probably not. Yes, the case is important. Yes, it is
apparently the first GPL court test, by consensus. But it won't
foretell the OSS future because it's a dispute about an
extraordinarily poor contract in a context of chaotic, changing
communications between the parties.</p><p>You can't project the prospects of a programming language
from analysis of one short, poorly documented application coded in
that language. And in this case, the underlying contract is an
outlier that's so far from norms of modern prudent software
management and licensing practices that by many orders of
magnitude, it's off the map. It ultimately will prove more relevant
for &ldquo;Software Product Management 101&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beginner Software
Contracts&rdquo; training than for refining OSS strategies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27be660"></a>Snapshot of a Train Wreck</h2></div></div><p>The story is told in the publicly available court pleadings.
The contract underlying the litigants' dispute is a disclosed
attachment to the answer filed by the Finnish authors of the
well-known MySQL OSS database to the lawsuit initiated by the US
software publisher/remarketer. (So the contract and the parties'
various arguments, e-mails and affidavits are &ldquo;open source&rdquo; for
tech managers, lawyers and trainers to study and use to improve
work processes.)</p><p>This author obtained from court pleadings the original
international agreement by which a publicly traded,
long-established business software company based in Massachusetts
obtained remarketing rights from a young, offshore, small developer
in Finland. Ugly surprise: these two companies agreed to do a
big-impact, large-dollar deal on a mere nine-paragraph contract.
The agreement ran all of 1.25 pages.</p><p>Progress Software agreed to pay roughly $300,000 US to a
dynamic foreign company in a new, unfamiliar (to Progress) industry
segment, on the equivalent of the proverbial envelope. MySQL AB,
the Finnish company, blessed the Massachusetts vendor's procurement
of its key product by a short statement indicating some future
contract would be utilized &ldquo;later&rdquo;, triggering &ldquo;a total of up to
$2.5 million&rdquo;. The resulting fight shows precisely why experienced
business people (including lawyers) frown at the optimistic idea of
&ldquo;let's just trust each other and figure out later the deal and the
details.&rdquo;</p><p>What's wrong with a little brevity and trust? Think of it
this way: why do surgery before taking x-rays or reviewing a
medical history? Why not dive head-first in to an unfamiliar river?
You can both get hurt and hurt others by launching a major software
initiative&mdash;OSS or proprietary&mdash;without first figuring out the
basic rules. That's what happened here.</p><p>One purpose of most contracts is similar to the norms of much
data processing: benchmarking, testing and standards. Here,
fragmentary code got shipped. That is, an incomplete &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;
was relied upon for too much action, too soon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27be8c8"></a>Deafening, Deadly Silence</h2></div></div><p>What did this short and ultimately bitter contract omit? The
majority of terms and conditions found in most software agreements,
that's what. Conspicuous by their absence, among other points, were
1) When would the expected &ldquo;later, superseding agreement&rdquo; be
completed? 2) Within what parameters for the business terms? 3)
Exactly what degree of service would be required and provided for
technical support? What did they mean by &ldquo;enterprise level
support&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing electronic support channels&rdquo;? 4) Who
would be the designated liaisons for intercompany coordination? 5)
What does it mean to give your licensee &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; rights to your
key trademark, as MySQL AB blessed here? What particular variations
would be permitted and excluded? 6) What ongoing product
enhancement services by the original author would be assured? 7)
How would disputes be resolved or arbitrated, if necessary? 8) If
there's a dispute due to one party's fault, will the nonbreaching
party get its enforcement costs and damages reimbursed by the
defaulting party? 9) Why omit all the often-derided generic or
&ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; provisions that are included in most contracts
precisely because they help prevent disputes and enable
enforcement?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27be9d0"></a>Learning Lessons from Others' Wrecks: Code Your
Contracts Like Your Software</h2></div></div><p>Most modern, mature software businesses recognize the many
issues that can and do arise in a software distribution deal. They
design their deal (e.g., in a &ldquo;terms sheet&rdquo; or outline), then
&ldquo;code&rdquo; (i.e., write a draft contract), then test and document
their <span   class="emphasis"><em>agreements</em></span> (i.e., negotiate and refine
the base contract and write and revise the necessary exhibits),
just as they do their <span   class="emphasis"><em>applications</em></span>.</p><p>For example, many software projects identify &ldquo;user
requirements&rdquo; in detail and in advance. This deal apparently
lacked a joint &ldquo;terms sheet&rdquo; or &ldquo;deal summary memo&rdquo; as the
anchor for the agreement.</p><p>Most applications get a look-over for quality control by
programmer colleagues. Automated code-testing tools get deployed in
some complex environments. This contract presumably was shipped out
as the handiwork of one individual, or at least of a very small
team.</p><p>Savvy software professionals include error-message features.
This oblique agreement lacked the typical &ldquo;notice of breach, then
opportunity to cure the breach&rdquo; provision.</p><p>Experienced coders include header files and other technical
documentation in their work to assist later revisions and
debugging. In your software transactions, include specified modes
of communications between the author and publisher companies.
Decide up front which particular individuals have the authorization
to pass commercial instructions, objections and suggestions to some
specified person(s) in the other organization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27bece8"></a>Frightful Images: Ships Passing in the
Night</h2></div></div><p>The contract's brevity means the parties may raise legal
issues that will muddy the waters or at least defer the outcome.
Remember, the wheels of the justice system can grind very slowly,
at least in the US.</p><p>OSS loyalists hoping for court affirmation of the GNU model
may be frustrated: both sides of the suit have already raised legal
arguments unrelated to the OSS issue. For example, MySQL AB has
already obtained (on February 28) a partial injunction against
Progress and its young OSS subsidiary NuSphere, but on trademark
law grounds, not enforcement of the GPL. The federal judge found
the GPL issue too uncertain to adjudicate in this litigation's
early, summary phase.</p><p>Then there's the legal doctrine of &ldquo;mutual mistake&rdquo;. A
contract sometimes can go unenforced when both parties
inadvertently hold different, though reasonable, interpretations of
the deal's predicate and terms. The classic case involves a similar
cross-border mishap.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27beea0"></a>When Going to Rome, Study Ahead</h2></div></div><p>The rashness of this saga is underscored by its multicountry
context. Transnational transactions merit extra thinking and terms,
just like multinational applications often require more modular
screen messaging, two-byte code (for Asian character sets),
accommodating different operating system iterations and other
shrewd coding.</p><p>Doing deals with foreign companies requires extra
consideration. For example, many offshore companies prefer (or
insist on) the use of arbitration to resolve disputes, both as part
of a strong cultural tradition and to avoid the rumored American
tendency toward premature, extended and expensive litigation.
(Here, the litigants filed 73 different court pleadings in the
initial nine months of the case, with no end in sight.)</p><p>World travelers arrange translators, confirm supply lines and
determine local communication protocols <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
setting out. In international contracts, many companies take
similar extra steps. They pre-agree on minimum collaborative
product planning, contractually commit to visit each other's
headquarters and meet at major global tradeshows and include other
contractual &ldquo;glue code&rdquo; to help refine the relationship. Common
sense says to develop a map when venturing into unfamiliar
territory. Here, the parties got lost and found themselves in
court, with the resulting marketing disasters, big litigation bills
and an uncertain product road map.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c6580.0x27bf0b0"></a>What to Think; What to Do</h2></div></div><p>Some in the OSS community have attacked Progress and
NuSphere, citing the accurate but fragmentary story that the MySQL
code got modified and then marketed via a proprietary license, not
the GPL or some other OSS license. True, NuSphere modified its
model to use GPL, and in NuSphere's view thus fixed a mere
short-term oversight. But that's not the full story. The pleadings
suggest another perspective: criticize Progress instead for letting
some product manager do a poorly documented contract, presumably
without coordinating with counsel and other colleagues. Sentence
this individual to attend a licensing workshop. Maybe commute the
sentence due to time-to-market competitive pressures. And then bet
good money that next time both companies will use traditional,
coherent, complete software contracts, after learning from spending
big bucks on litigators and losing time, managerial energy and
market goodwill.</p><p>The Progress-NuSphere-MySQL fight ultimately may prove to be
just another chapter in the long book of companies who practiced
&ldquo;ready, fire&rdquo; without adequate &ldquo;aim&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="6025s1.html" target="_self">Example of Poor Code</a></p></div></div>
