<i  >Linux Journal</i> is celebrating its 100th issue,
and I've decided to take a break from my exploration of open-source
web/database technologies to join the party.
</p><p>There are plenty of good reasons for Linux users (and
advocates of open-source software in general) to be happy. Despite
the downturn in the high-tech economy, open-source software
development continues at an extremely rapid pace. When
<i  >Linux Journal</i> was first published, few people
had ever heard of the free operating system created by a Finnish
student. Nowadays, many people have heard of Linux, even if they
don't understand what it is or what it can do for them.</p><p>Indeed, while many of my clients know that I push for
open-source solutions, they are always curious to know why I favor
them and, more importantly, why choosing such solutions is in their
interest as well. So at the risk of preaching to the converted,
this month's column reviews some of the reasons why Linux is such
an excellent platform for building server-side applications. I hope
some of the ideas I put forth here will help you evangelize free
software solutions with your own colleagues and clients in the
years to come.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c47580.0x1d3f5b0"></a>Cost and Stability</h2></div></div><p>Hackers are interested in technologies and tools that teach
new skills and perspectives. But in the real world, people are
interested in getting their jobs done as quickly and cheaply as
possible. Software is a means to an end, rather than an end in and
of itself.</p><p>For this reason, I've found that the best way to sell people
on open-source software is to say that it does more and costs less.
Either one of these factors isn't enough by itself; it's easy to
find expensive, high-quality software and useless to install cheap,
poor-quality software. As consumers, my clients are always eager to
get more for less, and free software appeals to them in this
way.</p><p>When I pitch solutions to my clients, I begin by explaining
that I'm offering them something they might have thought
impossible: inexpensive software that does what they want, without
crashing. When I explain to Windows users that I have yet to see a
Linux system crash in over six years of running dozens of systems,
they are shocked and incredulous. When I tell them that this
software is freely available on the Internet, they find it even
harder to believe.</p><p>My clients often wonder who is supporting the software and
what happens if things go wrong. They are relieved to hear that not
only can I offer them the support they need but that they can look
for support elsewhere if they don't approve of my work. This, of
course, contrasts sharply with the attitude and restrictions that
many consulting firms impose on software installations. The
open-source approach is thus friendlier to consumers than the
traditional software model, reducing costs and encouraging
competition.</p><p>Of course, not all free software is of high quality, and not
all consultants really know what they're doing. The community
development process can produce excellent results, but that doesn't
mean everything released on the Internet is guaranteed to be safe
and stable. Indeed, it's clear that many programs, including some
popular ones, were uploaded without undergoing any testing.
Programs like these give the entire Open Source community a bad
name and often do more harm than good. Several times per year,
clients call me in to fix a program they have downloaded that
worked fine at first, but eventually proved itself to be insecure,
unstable or full of bugs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c47580.0x1d3f818"></a>Fixing Bugs</h2></div></div><p>Even if you find that your server depends on a bug-ridden,
insecure, open-source application, all is not lost. That's because
the nature of free software ensures that you can modify it to suit
your needs or fix it when problems arise. In this way,
shared-source licenses, which allow users to view the source code
but not to modify or fix it, miss the point. Buying a house or a
car entitles you to fix it on your own; why should software be any
different?</p><p>True, the shared-source license does mean that more people
will look over the code, so security and stability problems will be
identified and fixed more quickly. But being able to read the
source code isn't nearly as important as being able to improve it.
Moreover, folding these improvements back into the community
version means that everyone else will benefit from your adjustments
and be able to make further improvements. Thus, contributing to the
community process is in the interest of everyone who uses
open-source software; it's not simply a nice thing to do.</p><p>Because I tend to use mature tools such as Linux, Apache,
Perl and Python, it's relatively rare for me to find bugs in the
software I download. But several times per year, I will discover a
problem or limitation in the software I use. Having access to the
source code guarantees that I can get up and running as quickly as
possible, and it also means that others will not have to suffer
through the bugs that I've fixed.</p><p>It's ironic that I can still use this argument today, given
that a similar problem with printer drivers was what drove Richard
Stallman to found the Free Software Foundation, whose GNU Project
has been crucial to the success of Linux and free software. It's
also amazing to discover how quickly we get used to having the
source available and to being able to inspect or modify every part
of our computer systems.</p><p>Along the same lines, Linux systems tend to come with
&ldquo;batteries included&rdquo;, to borrow a phrase from the Python world. I
recently began work on a project that will be deployed on Solaris,
and I soon remembered how much richer and better-stocked a typical
Linux distribution is when compared with a standard Solaris
installation. True, I can spend half a day downloading and
installing gcc, Perl, Python and the rest. But after years in which
gcc was available on every machine I ran, it felt like I had been
thrown back into the Dark Ages of UNIX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c47580.0x1d3fa80"></a>No Secrets</h2></div></div><p>Engineers are notoriously bad at keeping secrets, as Scott
Adams has occasionally pointed out in his
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dilbert</em></span> comics. Indeed, one of the things that
attracts me to open-source software is the fact that there are no
secrets. Clients hire me because they want to save themselves time
or because they lack expertise in a particular area, not because
they are forced to do so. For this reason, I tend to think of
myself as analogous to a lawyer or accountant, both of whom offer
advice and documents based on freely available information.</p><p>This &ldquo;no secrets&rdquo; philosophy tends to work well with my
clients, including those who aren't at all interested in knowing
how the software works. They know they can ask me questions, and
I'll give them the best answer I can, without having to hide behind
marketing hype, mandatory updates or double-talk. My technical
clients, of course, enjoy knowing they can dive into the code or
read the documentation; the only thing stopping them from knowing
what I know is time and experience.</p><p>My nonprofit clients, who are in many ways the perfect
audience for open-source software, are often excited by the
possibility of using such tools. In particular, I have found that
educational institutions like the idea of sharing information and
community involvement, in software as in other spheres of life.
Telling them they can both save money and participate in a
community of like-minded people is a powerful combination.
Moreover, nonprofits typically have little incentive to keep
changes within the company, meaning that they can more easily
participate in the Open Source community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c47580.0x1d3fc90"></a>High-Quality Toolkits</h2></div></div><p>When I first began to write this column for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, most server-side web applications were
handwritten CGI programs. A huge number of web sites still use such
programs. But as the Web has become more sophisticated, people have
demanded toolkits that make it easier to develop high-quality,
scalable web applications in a short amount of time. It shouldn't
come as any surprise that many proprietary software companies have
come to fill this void. It is shocking, however, to find out how
much money they want for their software&mdash;sold on the condition that
their consultants are hired to customize it, followed by a
mandatory service contract.</p><p>Luckily, the open-source world has responded. A number of
open-source toolkits can be used for creating sophisticated
server-side applications. Zope, as we have seen in recent months,
is a fantastic (if complicated) application server, making it
possible to create web applications that connect to databases and
other information sources. Next month, we'll begin to look at
OpenACS, designed to make on-line community systems easy to build
and modify. Furthermore, such environments as mod_perl, Mason and
the numerous Java- and XML-related tools sponsored by the Apache
Software Foundation increasingly mean that locating the right tool
can be as difficult as installing and using it.</p><p>But as wonderful as these toolkits are, we must remember that
not everyone will be won over. My harshest lesson on this front
came last year when a potential client decided against hiring me to
create a simple content management system for producing a product
catalog for the Web. I was told that my bid came in at $800,000
less than my closest competitor. However, because I was using
open-source software and the competition was a well-known name in
the world of content management, I lost out. (That client has had a
round of layoffs and quarterly losses since then, and their web
site still appears to be managed by hand, so at least I won a moral
victory of sorts.)</p><p>We should also remember that not every player in the
open-source sphere can be trusted to follow through on their
promises to the community. Many open-source advocates were
surprised and disappointed when Lutris pulled the plug on its
open-source Enhydra Enterprise Java application server last year,
turning it into a proprietary product. Luckily, there are
alternatives; not only has the GPL-licensed JBoss application
server dramatically grown in popularity over the last year, but Sun
recently made it clear that nonprofit, open-source J2EE
implementations will be able to receive official certification in
the coming months. This should help to reduce further the stigma
that some businesses associate with open-source software.</p><p>But even if you suffer setbacks, don't be fooled: as IBM, HP
and even Sun now acknowledge, Linux and open-source software are
powerful, stable and should be taken seriously. &ldquo;World
domination&rdquo; hasn't yet arrived, but brand-name recognition,
financial realities and admiration from academics and commercial
entities alike are helping us move ahead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c47580.0x1d3ff50"></a>Happy Birthday!</h2></div></div><p>I'll conclude this column with a salute to the hardworking
staff that makes this magazine possible. I read <i  >Linux Journal</i> for nearly a year before starting to write this
column, and I continue to read it when it comes in the mail every
month. The articles consistently reflect the diversity,
sophistication and interests of some of the most creative software
developers on the planet.</p><p>The fact that <i  >Linux Journal</i> has now
reached 100 issues should prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that
Linux and open-source software are here to stay. I hope to write a
similar article when the 200th anniversary issue comes
around.</p></div></div>
