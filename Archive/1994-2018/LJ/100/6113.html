install SuSE Linux, I discovered that after the boot, Linux could
not see the CD-ROM. It turned out that the docking station where
the CD-ROM lives is accessed from the computer via FireWire
somehow.</p><p>&mdash;Steven Smith,
<a href="mailto:sjs@chaos-tools.com">sjs@chaos-tools.com</a></p><p>Your confusion may be due to differing procedures for the
various distributions available. For SuSE, there is a basic HOWTO
guide in their knowledge base, which you can access by visiting
<a href="http://sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/tbraza_dosinst.html" target="_self">sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/tbraza_dosinst.html</a>.
This should get you headed in the right direction.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,

running HP-UX 11. I'm trying to read it using my Linux server that
runs Red Hat 7.2 (2.4.9.31SMP kernel). The Linux server tape drive
is a Sony SCSI device, /dev/st0. The tape contains Oracle export
files of a large Oracle database. The HP machine is no longer
available, and I'm trying to rebuild the DB on Linux. When I try to
read the tape with either <b  >tar -tvf /dev/st0</b> or
<b  >tar -xvf /dev/st0</b> I always get:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Input/Output error at the beginning of the tape, error is not
recoverable, exiting now
</pre><p>Why?
</p><p>&mdash;Adrian Manship,
<a href="mailto:adrian.manship@skynet.be">adrian.manship@skynet.be</a></p><p>Check two things related to the tape drive. First, DDS drives
support the concept of hardware compression, which may have been
used by HP-UX and may not be enabled by Linux. If there is a
mismatch in this setting, that can cause problems reading the
tape.</p><p>Second, although tar itself is a relatively standard format,
is it possible that the tape was not created using tar? Depending
on the version of Oracle used to create the tape, it may have
internal support for reading/writing tape devices as backup media.
Check a small sample of the file to be sure it is actually in tar
format by running <b  >dd if=/dev/st0 of=/tmp/tape bs=512
count=16</b>, replacing the bs value with a block size that
works well for your drive and the count value with a count that
yields a sufficient number of those blocks to take a quick look.
This example will read 8K from the tape.</p><p>Perhaps the tape itself is bad. If it succeeds, you should be
able to use a hex editor or text editor that can handle high-ASCII
characters without choking to verify the format of the contents of
the tape. In case you aren't familiar with the general format, each
file entry should start with its filename, followed by a header
that contains miscellaneous file information such as size and
permissions, followed by the file itself.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
<a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a></p><p>The easiest thing to do, would be to buy/borrow/steal a
similar machine to do the restore.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>I used to work with HP-UX DDS tapes, and most of
the time they were used with the cpio utility. Keep in mind that
cpio is a complicated utility with many options, so check the
manual pages (<b  >man cpio</b>) and play around with
some of the options. Be careful not to write your tape
accidently; I suggest that you physically enable the write-protect
feature on the cartridge. Look at

never installed correctly. If you made a rescue disk during the

SMTP</h2></div></div><p>Is it possible to have an internet mail server with a dial-up
connection to an ISP? I know that the IP address of ppp0 may change
whenever I establish a new connection with the ISP. The MX records
need to point to the mail server; the IP address of the server also
must be specified at dewdesigns but will not be valid if or when I
get a new connection. Do I need to run DNS locally or can I use the
ISP DNS? I recently read an article by Marcel Gagn&eacute;
regarding small-office mail servers, but I feel that I am missing
some pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>&mdash;Daryl E. Murray,
<a href="mailto:daryl@Planet4us.net">daryl@Planet4us.net</a></p><p>There are ways to have an SMTP server on a dial-up dynamic IP
and set up DNS so that it gets updated every time you change your
IP address, but trust me, you do not want to go there. Short of
running UUCP, which is the correct way to route mail in your case
(UUCP is quite old, not well-known by most system administrators
and probably not supported by your ISP), you should use Fetchmail
to download your mail. If you need to download mail for many
accounts, you can have your ISP spool all your mail in one mailbox,
download that with Fetchmail, and split it up again, looking at the
Envelope-To: field or whatever field in which your ISP stored the
original Envelope-To.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,
<a href="mailto:marc@merlins.org">marc@merlins.org</a></p><p>You only can use Fetchmail to download all of your site's
mail if your ISP consistently applies an Envelope-To: header to
your mail. See the warning at
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-man.html#25" target="_self">www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-man.html#25</a>.</p><p>If you have a dial-up with a static IP address, and your ISP
is willing to queue incoming mail for you, you can do an
<b  >SMTP ETRN</b> when the connection comes up. Sendmail
includes a utility to do this.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti,
