    In the first of a series of articles on device-driver development, we'll start with how the kernel handles the system console and serial ports.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x20703a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to a new column called Driving Me
Nuts. Here we are going to explore the different Linux kernel
driver subsystems and try to understand the wide range of different
interfaces they provide and expect a driver to provide. If there
are any specific subsystems that anyone would like explained,
please drop me an e-mail.
</p><p>There are a number of very good references on Linux kernel
programming and Linux driver programming (see Resources). This
column assumes you have at least skimmed these in the past or have
them handy as a reference.</p><p>To start things off, let's look into the kernel's tty layer.
This layer is used by all Linux users whenever they type at a
command prompt or use a serial port connection.</p><p>Every tty driver needs to create a struct tty_driver that
describes itself and registers that structure with the tty layer.
The struct tty_driver is defined in the include/linux/tty_driver.h
file. Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/100/5896.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue100/5896.tgz</a>]
shows what the structure looks like as of the 2.4.18 kernel
version. This is a rather large and imposing structure, so let's
try to break it into smaller pieces.</p><p>The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; field should always be set to TTY_DRIVER_MAGIC.
It's used by the tty layer to verify that it is really dealing with
a tty driver.</p><p>The driver_name and name fields are used to describe your
driver, and driver_name should be set to something descriptive, as
it will show up in the /proc/tty/drivers file. The name field is
used to specify what the /dev or devfs name base is for your
driver. As an example, the kernel serial driver sets the
driver_name field to serial, the name field to ttyS if devfs is not
enabled, and tts/%d if devfs is enabled. If devfs is enabled, it
will use the name field when creating new device nodes for your
driver. The %d portion of the name will be filled in with the minor
number of the device when it is registered in the tty
subsystem.</p><p>The name_base field is only necessary if your device does not
start at minor number 0. For almost all drivers, this should be set
to 0.</p><p>The major, minor_start and num fields are used to describe
what major/minor numbers are assigned to your driver to the tty
layer. The major field should be set to the major number assigned
to your driver. If you are creating a new driver, read the file
Documentation/devices.txt on getting a new major number for your
driver. This file is also good reading for anyone who wants to see
what major/minor number pair is used by what driver. The
minor_start field is used to specify where the first minor number
is for your device. If you have an entire major number assigned to
your driver, then this should be set to 0. The num field describes
how many different minor numbers you have assigned to your
driver.</p><p>So if you have all of major 188 assigned to your driver, then
your driver should set these fields to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>major: 188,</p></li><li><p>minor_start: 0,</p></li><li><p>num: 255,</p></li></ul></div><p>The type and subtype fields describe what kind of tty driver
your driver is to the tty layer. The type field can be set to the
following values:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_SYSTEM: used internally by the tty
subsystem to notify itself that it is dealing with an internal tty
driver. If this value is used, then subtype should be set to
SYSTEM_TYPE_TTY, SYSTEM_TYPE_CONSOLE, SYSTEM_TYPE_SYSCONS or
SYSTEM_TYPE_SYSPTMX. This type should not be used by any normal tty
driver.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_CONSOLE: only used by the console
driver. Do not use it for any other driver.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_SERIAL: used by any serial type
driver. If this value is used, then subtype should be set to
SERIAL_TYPE_NORMAL or SERIAL_TYPE_CALLOUT, depending on which type
your driver is. This is one of the most common settings for the
type field.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_PTY: used by the pseudo-terminal
interface (pty). If this value is used, then subtype needs to be
set to either PTY_TYPE_MASTER or PTY_TYPE_SLAVE.</p></li></ul></div><p>The init_termios field is used to set up the initial termios
(the line settings and speeds) for the device when it is first
created.</p><p>The flags field is set to a mixture of the following bit
values, depending on the needs of the driver:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_INSTALLED: if this bit is set, the
driver cannot register itself with the tty layer, so do not use
this value.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS: if this bit is set, the
tty layer will reset the termios setting whenever the last process
has closed the device. This is useful for the console and pty
drivers.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW: if this bit is set, it
indicates that the driver guarantees to set notifications of parity
or break characters up to the line driver if the line driver has
not asked to be notified of them. This is usually set for all
drivers, as it allows the line driver to be optimized a little
better.</p></li><li><p>TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS: if this bit is set, then the
call to tty_register_driver() will not create any devfs entries.
This is useful for any driver that dynamically creates and destroys
the minor devices, depending on whether the physical device is
present. Examples of drivers that set this are the USB to serial
drivers, the USB modem driver and the USB Bluetooth tty
driver.</p></li></ul></div><p>The refcount field is a pointer to an integer within the tty
driver. It is used by the tty layer to handle proper reference
counting of the driver and should not be touched by the tty
driver.</p><p>The proc_entry field should not be set by the tty driver
itself. If the tty driver implements the write_proc or read_proc
functions, then this field will contain the driver's proc_entry
field that will have been created for it.</p><p>The other field is only used by the pty driver and should not
be used by any other tty driver.</p><p>Now we have some pointers to different tty structures. The
table field is a pointer to an array of tty_struct pointers. The
termios and termios_locked fields are pointers to an array of
struct termios pointers. All of these arrays should have the same
number of entries as you have set the minor field to above. They
are used by the tty layer to handle the different minor devices
properly and should not be touched by your tty driver.</p><p>The driver_state field is only used by the pty driver and
should not be used by any other tty driver.</p><p>There is a large list of different function pointers in the
tty_driver structure. These function pointers are used by the tty
layer to call into the tty driver when it wants to do something.
Not all of them have to be defined by a tty driver, but a few of
them are required.</p><p>The open function is called by the tty layer when open(2) is
called on the device node to which your tty driver is assigned. The
tty layer calls this with a pointer to the tty_struct structure
assigned to this device and a file pointer. This field must be set
by a tty driver for it to work properly (otherwise, -ENODEV is
returned to the user when open(2) is called).</p><p>The close function is called by the tty layer when release(2)
is called on the file pointer that was previously created with a
call to open(2). This means that the device should be
closed.</p><p>The write function is called by the tty layer when data is to
be sent to your tty device. The data may come from user space or
kernel space (the field from_user will be set if the data comes
from user space). This function should return the number of
characters that are actually written to the device. This function
must be set for a tty driver.</p><p>The put_char function is called by the tty layer when a
single character is to be written to the device. If there is no
room in the device for the character to be sent, the character may
be ignored. If a tty driver does not define this function, then the
write function will be called when the tty layer wants to send a
single character.</p><p>The flush_chars function is called when the tty layer has
sent a number of characters to the tty driver using the put_char
function. The tty driver should tell the device to send all of the
data remaining in it out of the serial line.</p><p>The write_room function is called when the tty layer wants to
know how much room the tty driver has available in the write
buffer. This number will change over time as characters empty out
of the write buffers.</p><p>The chars_in_buffer function is called when the tty layer
wants to know how many characters are still remaining in the tty
driver's write buffer to be sent out.</p><p>The ioctl function is called by the tty layer when ioctl(2)
is called on the device node. It allows the tty driver to implement
device-specific ioctls. If the ioctl requested is not supported by
the driver, it should return -ENOIOCTLCMD. This allows the tty
layer to implement a generic version of the ioctl, if
possible.</p><p>The set_termios function is called by the tty layer when the
device's termios settings have been changed. The tty driver should
then change the physical settings of the device, depending on the
different fields of the termios structure. A tty driver should be
able to handle the fact that the old variable might be set to NULL
when this function is called.</p><p>The throttle and unthrottle functions are used to help
control overruns of the tty layer's input buffers. The throttle
function is called when the tty layer's input buffers are getting
full. The tty driver should try to signal the device that no more
characters are to be sent to it. The unthrottle function is called
when the tty layer's input buffers have been emptied out, and it
now can accept more data. The tty driver should then signal to the
device that data can be received.</p><p>The stop and start functions are much like the throttle and
unthrottle functions, but they signify that the tty driver should
stop sending data to the device and then later resume sending
data.</p><p>The hangup function is called when the tty driver should hang
up the tty device.</p><p>The break_ctrl function is called when the tty driver is to
turn on or off the BREAK status on the RS-232 port. If state is set
to -1, then the BREAK status should be turned on. If state is set
to 0, then BREAK should be turned off. If this function is
implemented by the tty driver, then the tty layer will handle the
TCSBRK, TCSBRKP, TIOCSBRK and TIOCCBRK ioctls. Otherwise these
ioctls will be sent to the tty driver's ioctl function.</p><p>The flush_buffer function is called when the tty driver is to
flush all of the data still in its write buffers. This means any
data remaining in them will be lost and not sent to the
device.</p><p>The set_ldisc function is called when the tty layer has
changed the line discipline of the tty driver. This function is
generally not used anymore and should not be set.</p><p>The wait_until_sent function is called when the tty layer
wants all of the pending data in the tty driver's write buffers to
be sent to the device. The function should not return until this is
finished and is allowed to sleep in order to achieve this.</p><p>The send_xchar function is used to send a high-priority XON
or XOFF character to the tty device.</p><p>The read_proc and write_proc functions are used if the driver
wants to implement a
/proc/tty/driver/&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>&gt; entry;
&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>&gt; will be set to the name field
described above. If either of these functions are set, then the
entry will be created and any read(2) or write(2) calls will be
passed to the appropriate function.</p><p>And finally, the next and prev fields are used by the tty
layer to chain all of the different tty drivers together and should
not be touched by the tty driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x2071aa8"></a>No Read?</h2></div></div><p>One thing that might stand out in the above list of functions
is the lack of a read function to be implemented by the tty driver.
The tty layer contains a buffer that it uses to send data to user
space when read(2) is called on a tty device node. This buffer
needs to be filled up by the tty driver whenever it receives any
data from the device. Because tty data does not show up whenever a
user asks for it, or wants it, this model is necessary. That way
the tty layer buffers any received data and the individual tty
driver does not have to worry about blocking until data shows up on
the tty line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x2071bb0"></a>The Tiny tty Driver</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have gone over all of the different fields, which
ones are actually necessary to get a basic tty driver up and
running? Listing 2 is an example of the most minimal tty driver
possible. Once the steps shown there are completed, create the
tiny_open, tiny_close, tiny_write and tiny_write_room functions and
you are finished with a tiny tty driver.</p><p><a href="5896l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Minimal TTY
Driver</a></p><p>For an example implementation of a tiny tty driver, see
Listing 3 [available at
<a href="../listings/100/5896.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue100/5896.tgz</a>].
This tty driver creates a timer to place data into the tty layer
every two seconds in order to emulate real hardware. It also
properly handles locking the device structures when it is run on an
SMP machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x20686a8"></a>Flow of Data</h2></div></div><p>When the tty driver's open function is called, the driver is
expected to save some data within the tty_struct variable that is
passed to it. This is so the tty driver will know which device is
being referenced when the later close, write and other functions
are called. If this is not done, the driver can key off of the
MINOR(tty-&gt;device) function, which returns the minor number for
the device.</p><p>If you look at the tiny_open function, the tiny_serial
structure is saved within the tty driver. This allows the
tiny_write, tiny_write_room and tiny_close functions to retrieve
the tiny_serial structure and manipulate it properly.</p><p>The open and close functions of a tty driver can be called
multiple times for the same device as different user programs
connect to the device. This could allow one process to read data
and another to write data. To handle everything correctly, you
should keep a count of how many times the port has been opened or
closed. When the port is opened for the first time you can do the
necessary hardware initialization and memory allocation. When the
port is closed for the last time you can do the proper hardware
shutdown and free any allocated memory. See the tiny_open() and
tiny_close() functions for examples of how the number of times the
port is opened can be accounted for.</p><p>When data is received from the hardware, it needs to be
placed into the tty device's flip buffer. This can be done with the
following bit of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (i = 0; i &lt; data_size; ++i) {
        if (tty-&gt;flip.count &gt;= TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE)
                tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
        tty_insert_flip_char(tty, data[i], 0);
}
tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
</pre><p>This example makes sure there are no buffer overflows in the
tty flip buffer as the data is being added. For drivers that accept
data at very high rates, the tty-&gt;low_latency flag should be
set, which will cause the last call to tty_flip_buffer_push() to be
executed immediately when called. In the example driver, the
tty_timer function inserts one byte of data into the tty's flip
buffer and then resubmits the timer to be called again. This
emulates a slow stream of characters being received from a hardware
device.
</p><p>When data is to be sent to the hardware, the write function
is called. It is important that the write call checks the from_user
flag to prevent it from accidentally trying to copy a user-space
buffer directly into kernel space. The write function is allowed to
return a short write. This means that the device was not able to
send all of the data requested. It is up to the user-space program
that is calling the write(2) function to check the return value
properly to determine if all of the data was really sent. It is
much easier for this check to be done in user space than it is for
a kernel driver to sleep until all of the requested data is able to
be sent out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x20689c0"></a>The tty Interface over Time</h2></div></div><p>The tty layer has been very stable from the 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4
kernel versions, with only a very minor amount of functionality
added over time. So a tty driver written for 2.0 will successfully
work on 2.4 with almost no changes. Throughout the 2.5 kernel
series, the tty layer has been marked for a rewrite, so this
article may describe things that are no longer true. When in doubt,
read the include/tty_driver.h file of the kernel version for which
you wish to develop. Also, take a look at any of the tty drivers in
the driver/char kernel directory for examples of how to implement
some of the functions that are not covered here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f78580.0x2068ac8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>We have covered the basics of the tty layer, explaining all
of the different fields in the tty_driver structure for the 2.4
kernel tree and pointing out which ones are necessary for a driver
to implement. The tiny_tty.c driver, see Listing 3 [available at
<a href="../listings/100/5896.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue100/5896.tgz</a>],
is a good example of a very minimal tty driver that successfully
works. Feel free to use this code as an example for your own tty
drivers in the future.</p><p><a href="5896s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
