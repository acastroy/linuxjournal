Equus Computer Systems, Inc.'s 1.5U Server</h2></div></div><p>
IT operations seeking to optimize valuable data-center rack space while
improving efficiency are the target customers sought by Equus Computer
Systems, Inc., for its &ldquo;unique&rdquo; new 1.5U server with data transfer
rates of 12GiB/s. With two drive drawers each supporting eight 3.5"
hot-swappable SAS/SATA hard drives and delivering up to 160TB of drive
storage in a compact form factor, Equus' server also supports two
internal 2.5" SSD drives, meaning it can scale out to 16 data drives
while still providing a separate redundant OS volume. Equus observes that
the 1.5U server can accommodate 33% more drives than a typical 2U
server while using 25% less rack space. The availability of two
drive drawers means drive failure will not bring down the server. Users
simply can pull out the drive drawer and remove the failed drive while
the rest of the drives in the drawer remain online. The flexible 1.5U
server is a great fit for academia, medical, enterprise or content
delivery applications, and it functions well for object-oriented storage
or as database, file or analytic servers.

Parrot S.L.A.M.dunk</h2></div></div><p>
Powered by Ubuntu and Robot Operating System (ROS), the Parrot
S.L.A.M.dunk open development hardware and software kit enables
drones to transform into smart robots. Parrot's S.L.A.M.dunk
(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology enables the design
of advanced applications that enable the drone to understand and map
its surroundings in 3D and self-navigate in environments with multiple
barriers or lack of a GPS signal. Because Parrot S.L.A.M.dunk exploits
ROS, the leading Linux-based versatile robotic development environment, it
can be used not only for standard drone applications but also for a much
wider set of &ldquo;robots&rdquo;&mdash;that is, flying wings, articulated arms and roving
robots. Parrot S.L.A.M.dunk applications include autonomous navigation for
drones and robots, 3D mapping, obstacle avoidance, prototyping of drones
and robotic solutions and data gathering via the stereo camera and sensor
array (IMU, barometer, magnetometer, ultrasound). Parrot asserts that it
developed Parrot S.L.A.M.dunk to be as easy and user-friendly
as possible for developers, researchers, integrators and academics.

DVEO's Jitter Box IP/IP</h2></div></div><p>
Telco TV/OTT and IPTV operators must deal with the fact that many IP
transport streams are asynchronous. This makes the streams prone to poor
video quality due to jitter if they are sent to Program Clock Reference
(PCR)-compliant devices. A new corrective solution for this challenge
is DVEO's Jitter Box IP/IP, a low-power, Linux-based IP PCR jitter-correction appliance. Designed for telco TV/OTT and IPTV operators,
the Jitter Box IP/IP corrects the PCR in IP video transport streams
so IP streams can be jitter-free and interoperate with PCR-sensitive
devices, such as modulators, muxers, decoders and encapsulators. If an IP
stream is not compliant, the Jitter Box IP/IP can make it so. Jitter Box
IP/IP also features a web-based GUI that is manageable from anywhere,
adds DVEO.

CORSAIR's Carbide Air 740</h2></div></div><p>
Part of the joy of owning a custom-built PC is building it yourself,
notes CORSAIR. (Oh, do we agree!) In an effort to promote endless
PC-making joy, CORSAIR developed the new Carbide Air 740 PC case that
&ldquo;offers remarkable cooling performance and the flexibility to handle
even the most ambitious enthusiast system builds&rdquo;. The Carbide Air
740 features CORSAIR's innovative dual-chamber Direct Airflow Path
design, innovative cooling capabilities, unique bold design and a
stunningly tinted, fully removable side-windowed panel. An evolution
of the well received CORSAIR Carbide Air 540, the Carbide Air 740's
Direct Airflow Path design fully utilizes the space within the case by
splitting the system's hardware between two compartments. The main
chamber houses the core heat generating system components&mdash;motherboard,
CPU, graphics cards and memory&mdash;while the rear chamber mounts the
3.5in/2.5in drive bays and the PSU. This arrangement, claims CORSAIR,
maximizes the airflow from the three pre-installed 140mm fans, delivering
unparalleled, unimpeded airflow through the main compartment. Drive
cages and cables are neatly tucked away and don't interfere with
airflow, all without compromising storage capacity. To maximize the
coolness of running so cool, the Carbide Air 740's enormous, hinged
and fully removable side panel is perfect for showing off those amazing
builds and setups.

Bruce Nikkel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Forensic Imaging</em></span> (No Starch
Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Forensic image acquisition is an important part of the process of
after-the-fact incident response and evidence collection. Digital forensic
investigators acquire, preserve and manage digital evidence as part of
criminal and civil court cases; they examine violations of organizational
policy; and they analyze cyber attacks. Author Bruce Nikkel, in his new
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Forensic Imaging</em></span>, takes an in-depth look into how to secure
and manage digital evidence using Linux command-line tools. This essential
guide walks readers through the entire forensic acquisition process
and covers a wide range of practical scenarios and situations related
to the imaging of storage media. Readers learn how to perform critical
tasks, such as performing forensic imaging of modern and legacy storage
technologies; protecting evidence media from accidental modification;
managing large forensic image files; preserving and verifying evidence
integrity with cryptographic and other tools; working with newer drive
and interface technologies; managing drive security and acquiring usable
images from more complex or challenging situations, such as RAID systems,
virtual machine images and damaged media. With its unique focus on digital
forensic acquisition and evidence preservation, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical
Forensic Imaging</em></span>
is a valuable resource for experienced digital forensic investigators
wanting to advance their Linux skills and experienced Linux administrators
wanting to learn digital forensics.
