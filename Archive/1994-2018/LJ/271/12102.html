The Internet of Things (IoT) is gathering momentum, with predictions
of 20 billion devices connected to the internet in just a few years.
Many of these devices will be running on batteries and communicating
using wireless. One of the emerging standards is 6LoWPAN, IPv6 over
low power wireless personal-area networks. This is the first article 
in a series looking at how to use 6LoWPAN on Linux, using Openlabs
6LoWPAN modules running on Raspberry Pis.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21ef1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the new kids on the block. It
promises connection of sensors and actuators to the internet, for data to
flow both ways, and once on the internet, to become part of new and exciting
business systems, reaching up into the realms of big data and artificial
intelligence.
</p><p>
IoT applications will rely on a large and complex system. One of the
components in this will be the connections between sensors and actuators
and the internet. This will most likely be wireless, and it will have to be low
power. If you have a thousand sensors, they will most likely be running off
batteries, and you will want those batteries to last years, not days.
</p><p>
Low power wireless is heading in two directions right now:
personal-area networks (LoWPAN) spanning up to 20&ndash;30 meters and wide-area
networking (LPWAN) of up to 20 or more kilometers. The technologies at the
physical layer are completely different and lead to different Linux
solutions. This article deals only with LoWPAN.
</p><p>
The physical layer for LoWPAN is specified by IEEE802.15.4. This defines
communication using various wireless bands, such as 2.4GHz, with a range of
about 10 meters and data transfer rates of 250kb/s&mdash;good enough for most
sensors, but not good enough to stream MP3s!
</p><p>
On top of IEEE802.15.4 is a variety of protocols: Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread
and so on.
Of these, only the IETF 6LoWPAN is an open standard, and this is
where the Linux development community has settled. This article 
covers only 6LoWPAN. I also ignore other wireless systems, such as
Bluetooth LE.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21ef510"></a>
6LoWPAN and Linux</h2></div></div><p>
6LoWPAN is IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4 wireless. That isn't easy. IPv6 is
designed for the current internet, while IEEE802.15.4 is designed for a
different environment. You don't need to worry about how this mismatch has
been overcome, but it does mean you need to be aware that two different
levels are dealt with here: getting two wireless
<span   class="emphasis"><em>devices</em></span> to talk to each
other and getting a <span   class="emphasis"><em>networking</em></span> layer talking over these devices.
</p><p>
The device layer is where physical hardware choices come into play. Linux
supports several devices, such as the AT86RF230 series, the MRF24J40 and
several others. The kernel needs to have those device drivers compiled in
or available as dynamically loadable modules.
</p><p>
The networking layer requires 6LoWPAN support. Again, the kernel needs to
have this compiled in or available as modules. These modules are the
ieee802154_6LoWPAN, ieee802154 and mac802154 modules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21ef778"></a>
6LoWPAN Devices and the Raspberry Pi</h2></div></div><p>
The Raspberry Pi is a wonderful toy or a full-blown Linux computer,
depending on your viewpoint. With its GPIO pins, it can act as a connection
into the realm of sensors and actuators, while with Ethernet (and on the
RPi3, Wi-Fi), it can be a part of LANs and WANs. For the IoT, it (and the
Arduino) form an excellent bridge between the physical and ICT worlds. But,
there are now IEEE802.15.4 modules available, and they can be used to turn
an RPi into a &ldquo;full-function 6LoWPAN device&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I used the RPi with the OpenLabs &ldquo;Raspberry Pi 802.15.4 radio&rdquo;. This is an
Atmel AT86RF233 radio on a small board with a header that allows it to be
plugged straight onto pins 15&ndash;26 of the RPi. It can be plugged in facing
out or facing in&mdash;facing in the right way to do it.
</p><p>
I started off using the standard Raspbian distro (dated May 27, 2016). This
can be set up to recognize the radio, but&mdash;oh dear!&mdash;the 4.4 Linux kernel
it uses has 6LoWPAN modules, but they don't work properly in that kernel.
The IPv6 packets get corrupted even for pinging itself, so this
Raspbian distro won't support 6LoWPAN.
</p><p>
The hunt is on then for a setup that allows the RPi to support 6LoWPAN with
an AT86RF233 radio. This is painful: there are many helpful sites that are
outdated or with instructions that I just couldn't get to work. I finally
was pointed by
Sebastian Meiling to his page &ldquo;Create a generic Raspbian image with 6LoWPAN
support&rdquo;
(<a href="https://github.com/RIOT-Makers/wpan-raspbian/wiki/Create-a-generic-Raspbian-image-with-6LoWPAN-support#4-new-linux-kernels-for-the-pi" target="_self">https://github.com/RIOT-Makers/wpan-raspbian/wiki/Create-a-generic-Raspbian-image-with-6LoWPAN-support#4-new-linux-kernels-for-the-pi</a>). In summary, what is needed is an upstream Linux kernel, 4.7 or
4.8, recent firmware and suitable configuration of the 
/boot/config.txt file. At the time of this writing, these instructions work only for
the RPi 1 and 2. The RPi 3 isn't working yet, but it may be by the time this
article is published.

Installing a 6LoWPAN Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
For this article I'm using the OpenLabs module on the RPi 2B. For other
modules and RPis, see Sebastian's page. I'm also going to assume a reasonable
amount of Linux savvy in installing software and building from source.
</p><p>
Start by installing the latest Raspbian image. If that runs a 4.7 (or
later) kernel, you may be okay already; otherwise, you need to build and
install an upstream 4.7 kernel. You probably will need extra tools for
this, such as <tt  >rpi-update</tt>,
<tt  >git</tt>, <tt  >libncurses5-dev</tt>,
<tt  >bc</tt> and maybe development
tools that you can install using <tt  >apt-get</tt>.
</p><p>
Before you do anything else, make sure your system is up to date by
running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rpi-update
</pre>
</p><p>
This will install the latest firmware bootloader.
</p><p>
Download a 4.7 kernel into the linux-rpi2 directory with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git \
          --branch rpi-4.7.y --single-branch linux-rpi2
</pre>
</p><p>
Building a kernel means compiling a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of files and
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very slow</em></span> on the
RPi. Most people recommend cross-compiling, but that's more complex, and I like
things simple. So, I prefer to build on the RPi itself. It takes only about
5 hours, so start it up, and either go to bed or go out, listen to some jazz
and stay out late.
</p><p>
In the linux-rpi2 directory, set up a configuration file for the RPi 2B
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make bcm2709_defconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
Then run <tt  >menuconfig</tt> to do two things:
</p><p>
1) Install the device driver as a module from the menu entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Device Drivers
--&gt; Network device support
  --&gt; IEEE 802.15.4 drivers
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Install 6LoWPAN support as a module from the menu entry:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
Networking support
--&gt; Networking options
  --&gt; IEEE Std 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area 
      Networks support
</pre>
</p><p>
Build the kernel and associated files with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make zImage modules dtbs -j4
</pre>
</p><p>
Five hours later, install the modules and dtbs files:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo make modules_install dtbs_install
</pre>
</p><p>
The safest way to install the kernel is to copy it to an appropriate
location. When I run <tt  >make kernelversion</tt> in the source tree, it tells me I
have built 4.7.2. So I use that number in copying the kernel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/kernel.4.7.2.img
</pre>
</p><p>
That way I don't destroy any existing images, so I have a safe fallback to
the previous system.
</p><p>
Finally, you need to tell the RPi to boot into the new kernel. As root, edit
/boot/config.txt and add these lines at the end:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kernel=kernel.4.7.2.img
device_tree=bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb
dtoverlay=at86rf233
</pre>
</p><p>
What does that do? First, it tells the RPi to use the new boot image
kernel.4.7.2.img. Second&mdash;and this is currently ARM-specific&mdash;it tells
the RPi to pick up hardware default values using the <span   class="emphasis"><em>device
tree</em></span> system
from bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb. And third&mdash;and this is RPi-specific&mdash;it says
to add in the at86rf233 device in an additional file to the device tree
file.
</p><p>
Finally...reboot. If all went well, you should have the new kernel running.
Check this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uname -a
</pre>
</p><p>
It should show something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Linux raspberrypi 4.7.2-v7+ #1 SMP Fri Aug 26 15:45:29 UTC 2016
 &#8618;armv7l GNU/Linux
</pre>
</p><p>
If it didn't boot or showed the wrong kernel, take your SD card back to
somewhere else so you can comment out the lines you added to
/boot/config.txt. Back on the RPi, reboot back into the default kernel, and
try to figure out which step went wrong. I skipped some steps from
Sebastian's guide because I didn't need them, but if your system isn't
working, pay very close attention to his guide. He seems to be pretty
diligent about updating it.

Setting Up 6LoWPAN</h2></div></div><p>
Are you there yet? Sorry, no. You've built and installed an upstream kernel
with 6LoWPAN support. You're more than half-way there though. To configure the
6LoWPAN stack, you need another tool, <tt  >wpan-tools</tt>.
Get this from GitHub:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/linux-wpan/wpan-tools.git 
 &#8618;wpan-tools
</pre>
</p><p>
Before you can build this though, you need
<tt  >autoreconf</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf
</pre>
</p><p>
Then in the wpan-tools directory, you can run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./autogen.sh
./configure CFLAGS='-g -O0' --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
 &#8618;--libdir=/usr/lib
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
What's going on here? Linux is part of the UNIX family of operating systems
(including BSD, among many others). They all have quirks, and source code
authors have to deal with those. There have been many tools to make this
management easier, and <tt  >wpan-tools</tt> uses
<tt  >autoreconf</tt> to build a configuration
file, then <tt  >configure</tt> to work out the specifics of your RPi system so that
when you <tt  >make</tt> your application, all of the correct
pieces are in place.
</p><p>
The result of this is that the application <tt  >iwpan</tt> is now in the /usr/bin
directory for use.
</p><p>
You're nearly there! Remember in the kernel configuration you set the
6LoWPAN and device drivers to be dynamic modules. They won't have been
installed by default like you would expect modules to be. That's what all
this device tree stuff is about&mdash;bringing devices into the system when it
can't detect them normally. So the next step is to load the modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo modprobe at86rf230
</pre>
</p><p>
Then <tt  >lsmod</tt> should include something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Module                  Size  Used by
ieee802154_6LoWPAN     19335  0

Configuring 6LoWPAN</h2></div></div><p>
So now you have a new kernel, you have the at86rf230 device recognized, and
the 6LoWPAN networking stack is in place. The final steps are to configure
networking and bring the device up. You likely are used to Wi-Fi networks
having an SSID. IEEE802.15.4 networks have a similar concept, a PAN ID. Two
devices will be on the same network only if they have the same PAN ID. You
use <tt  >iwpan</tt> to set this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iwpan dev wpan0 set pan_id 0xbeef
</pre>
</p><p>
The ID of <tt  >0xbeef</tt> isn't fixed, but every example seems to use it!
</p><p>
Then, you bring up the interface using normal networking tools:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
ifconfig wpan0 up
ifconfig lowpan0 up
</pre>
</p><p>
What have you got now? <tt  >ifconfig</tt> returns something
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lowpan0   Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr
 &#8618;EE-0B-FB-0F-76-B9-F3-93-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00

</p><p>
The interface <tt  >wpan0</tt> is the wireless device. The
interface <tt  >lowpan0</tt> is the
6LoWPAN network device, just like <tt  >eth0</tt>, the loopback device and so on. Note how
it has an IPv6 address, but no IPv4 address&mdash;this is next-generation IP
only!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x25e9ac8"></a>
Ping!</h2></div></div><p>
You are done! Well, almost. There is an old <span   class="emphasis"><em>B.C.</em></span> comic
strip where one character
invents the telephone. &ldquo;Who do we ring?&rdquo; asks his friend.
&ldquo;I only invented
one&rdquo; is the reply. You need someone to talk to. So, do all this over again
with another RPi. You did buy two RPis and two wireless modules, didn't
you?
</p><p>
The <tt  >ifconfig</tt> command tells you the IPv6 address of the 6LoWPAN device. From
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> device, once you have it set up, do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ping6 -I lowpan0 fe80::ec0b:fb0f:76b9:f393 # IPv6 address of 
                                           # the other device
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x25e9e38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
ping6  fe80::ec0b:fb0f:76b9:f393%lowpan0
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >ping6</tt> command is the IPv6 version of
<tt  >ping</tt>. The IPv6 address of each
network interface is assigned automatically and is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>link
local</em></span> address.
</p><p>
If you have multiple interfaces, each of them can be on a network segment
with non-routable link local addresses. Hosts on these different network
segments <span   class="emphasis"><em>can have the same address</em></span>. These are like IPv4 link local
addresses 169.254.0.0/16, and they can't be routed across different network
segments. So in Linux, you need to specify the interface to use
(<tt  >lowpan0</tt>)
to avoid possible confusion. There are two ways of doing this: either use the
<tt  >-I lowpan0</tt> option or append
<tt  >%lowpan0</tt> to the IPv6 address.
</p><p>
On my system, this produces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ping6 -I lowpan0 fe80::ec0b:fb0f:76b9:f393
PING fe80::ec0b:fb0f:76b9:f393(fe80::ec0b:fb0f:76b9:f393) from

</pre>
</p><p>
Success! The two devices can ping each other across 6LoWPAN.
What if it doesn't work? Well, it didn't work for me for a long time, and
working out where the failure occurred was painful. It turned out to be a
wrong kernel for 6LoWPAN. To troubleshoot, first keep running
<tt  >ifconfig</tt>. This tells you
which interfaces are getting and sending packets. It told me that the
wireless layer (<tt  >wpan0</tt>) was getting and receiving packets, but the
networking layer wasn't. Then I ran <tt  >wireshark</tt> using
selector <tt  >ip6</tt> on packets,
and it showed me errors at the network layer. The command
<tt  >dmesg</tt> gave gold,
telling me the IPv6 packets were corrupted, even when pinging myself.
</p><p>
In desperation, I turned to Sebastian, giving him as much information as I
could (<tt  >uname</tt>, firmware version using /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd, contents of

only the first line: wrong kernel. But, spending time working out a detailed
report at least shows you are serious. &ldquo;Duh, it doesn't work&rdquo; isn't helpful
to a maintainer!

A Sensor and a Receiver</h2></div></div><p>
You don't really need 6LoWPAN to communicate between Raspberry Pis. Wi-Fi
and Ethernet are better. But now suppose one of them is a sensor running
off a battery or solar panel. Wi-Fi is estimated to drain a battery within a
fortnight; whereas 6LoWPAN on batteries can be expected to run for several
years. I'm simulating this here by using one of the RPis as sensor for
convenience.
</p><p>
To follow along, you will need to set up a client-server system. Usually,
people think of servers
as big grunty machines somewhere, but in the IoT world, the sensors will be
the servers, handling requests for values from clients elsewhere in the
network.
</p><p>
The server is just like a normal IPv6 server as described in the Python
documentation: 18.1. <tt  >socket</tt> &mdash;Low-level networking interface
(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" target="_self">https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html</a>). But note
that just as with the <tt  >ping6</tt> command above, you need to specify the network
interface to be used. This means you have to use Python 3 rather than Python
2, as this has the socket function
<tt  >socket.if_nametoindex()</tt> that allows you
to specify the IPv6 &ldquo;scope id&rdquo;, which is the interface you use.
</p><p>
I don't want to complicate this article with how to add sensors to an RPi.
Instead, I'll just measure the temperature of the RPi's CPU, as this can
be found really easily by running this command from a shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vcgencmd measure_temp	
</pre>
</p><p>
This will return a string like:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
temp=36.9'C
</pre>
</p><p>
Within Python, you create a process to run this command using
<tt  >Popen</tt> and read
from the <tt  >stdout</tt> pipeline.
</p><p>
Here's an IPv6 TCP server that waits for connections, sends the temperature and
then closes the connection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import socket
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

HOST = ''    # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces
PORT = 2016  # Arbitrary non-privileged port

def get_cpu_temperature():
    process = Popen(['vcgencmd', 'measure_temp'], stdout=PIPE)
    output, _error = process.communicate()
    return output

def main():
    s6 = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    scope_id = socket.if_nametoindex('lowpan0')
    s6.bind((HOST, PORT, 0, scope_id))
    s6.listen(1)
    
    while True:
        conn, addr = s6.accept()
        conn.send(get_cpu_temperature())
        conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's a client that opens a connection and reads the temperature
every ten
seconds:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import socket
import time

ADDR = 'fd28:e5e1:86:0:e40c:932d:df85:4be9' # the other RPi
PORT = 2016

def main():
    # scope_id = socket.if_nametoindex('lowpan0')
    while True:
        s6 = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
        s6.connect((ADDR, PORT, 0, 0))
        data = s6.recv(1024)
        print(data.decode('utf-8'), end='')

        # get it again after 10 seconds
        time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
The output looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
temp=37.4'C
temp=37.4'C
temp=37.9'C
</pre>

What's My Server's Address?</h2></div></div><p>
So imagine you've now got 1,000 of these sensors scattered out in the wild
somewhere, and they are all running IPv6 servers. What are their addresses?
How do you talk to them? Unfortunately, the OpenLabs module generates a new
MAC address each time it is booted, so it generates a new IPv6 address each
time. Running multi-cast discovery is not recommended for these low power
networks as it is a power drain. I will cheat a bit in the next article,
but show better ways in the third article.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The scenario presented in the last section is still a bit unrealistic. If
you have enough power to drive an RPi as a sensor, you probably have
enough power for it to use Wi-Fi or Ethernet. But soon there will be genuine
low power sensors using 6LoWPAN, and this article has shown you how to
bring them into one particular Linux system. It's been pretty heavy going,
but right now this is cutting-edge stuff, so expect to bleed a bit!
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll describe how to bring a 6LoWPAN network into the
standard IPv6 world, and in the third article, I plan to look at CoAP, the equivalent
of HTTP for low power networks.
