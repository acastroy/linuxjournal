I like the idea of life hacking. I'm not sure it's a term that you'll find in the
dictionary (although perhaps&mdash;dictionaries have some odd things in them now), but the idea of
improving life by programmatically changing things is awesome. I think that might be
why I'm such an open-source fan. When it's possible to change the things you don't
like or improve on something just because you can, it makes computing far less
mystical and far more enjoyable.

This month's issue starts off with Reuven M. Lerner discussing machine learning. Whether
you consider it creepy or incredible (or possibly somewhere in between), sites like
Amazon.com do an amazing job of determining what sorts of things you might want to buy.
All those years of companies data mining for the off chance they'd connect you to
something you might want to buy has turned into a very specific automation to pair
buyers with items they likely want. And it works so well it's scary. Reuven talks
about the science behind the magic.

Kyle Rankin follows with part two of his series on server hardening. My go-to response
for &ldquo;what is the best upgrade for a server?&rdquo; used to be
&ldquo;RAM&rdquo;. Now, that answer has
been superseded by &ldquo;hardening&rdquo;. Kyle is a system administrator by trade, and he shares
his skills with us in this ongoing series.

I decided to address a different problem this
month: figuring out how to graph data. It's been on my back burner for
years, and this seemed to be the perfect time to suss out the specifics on graphing data.
If you've ever been confused and intrigued by MRTG and RRDTools, check out my look at
Cacti this month. I learned a lot, and hopefully you will too.

During the past few years, I've learned to write just enough code to be dangerous. That
sounds like a silly quip, but really, if you're writing code for a production
environment, mistakes can be dangerous. Since I was never formally taught, it means my
attempts are likely ridden with security holes and inefficient code. Susan Sons talks about
code triage this month. Looking at other peoples' code is often overwhelming and
seldom fun. Susan talks about how to do a relatively quick look at existing code to try
to identify problems or poor programming choices. It's a great article, but it forced me
to realize just how much I shouldn't be writing mission-critical code!

Jan Newmarch teaches us about 6LoWPAN in this issue. With devices around the
house connecting to the Internet of Things at an increasing rate, low power
connectivity is an important topic to understand. Jan discusses how to utilize the low
power standards in existing equipment and how to plan your IoT implementations
correctly from the start. Dibyendu Roy follows with a look at how to implement assembly
code into GCC on devices that aren't strictly Intel-based. Assembly code is extremely
fast, and by using chunks of it in your higher-level programs, you can really benefit
on several fronts. Thankfully assembly code exists for multiple platforms and can be
integrated inline. Dibyendu shows how.

If you're not happy with the world as it is, it's up to you to change the world. As
open-source advocates, that's something we've been doing for years. With the advent of
the Internet of Things, we have an opportunity to change the way our physical world
works, and Linux is leading the way. This issue is full of insightful information about
new technology, improvements on old tech and all the other things you expect from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. Whether you're here for the new product announcements or want to
see what weird new app I've found, we hope this issue has something for everyone.
