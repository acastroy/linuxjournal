RRD and MRTG are confusing; Cacti makes everything simple!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x1084358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past few years, I've been trying to understand how to make graphs using
RRDtool (Round-Robin Database tool) after failing miserably to understand MRTG
(Multi-Router Traffic Grapher) before that. The thing I like about RRDtool
is that it's newer and supports a wider variety of data sources. It's
still incredibly complicated though, and I've given up on learning how to use it
on multiple occasions. That's when I discovered Cacti.
</p><p>
Cacti is not a new program. It's been around for a long time, and in its
own way, it's a complicated beast itself. I finally really took the time to figure
it out, however, and I realized that it's not too difficult to use. The cool
part is that Cacti makes RRDtool manipulation incredibly convenient. It
did take me the better part of a day to understand Cacti fully, so hopefully
this article will save you some time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x1084568"></a>
The Goal</h2></div></div><p>
I want to create a graph that graphs something automatically and does
it using a bash script as the input as opposed to SNMP or anything like
that. I've been using bash for years, and I'm comfortable using the
command line to procure data. In fact, for this project, I'm going to
adapt a script I use for BirdTopia (my continual birdcam project for the
past few years) that will pull a temperature from the command line. I want
to pull the temperature from two different cities and graph them
together. For this example, I use Petoskey, Michigan (where I live), and Houston, Texas
(where <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> headquarters are located).
</p><p>
Here's the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
curl -s "http://api.wunderground.com/weatherstation/
 &#8618;WXCurrentObXML.asp?ID=$1" \
| grep temp_f | sed 's/.//' | sed 's/.//' | sed 
 &#8618;'s/&lt;temp_f&gt;//' | sed 's/&lt;\/temp_f&gt;//'
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks complex, but really it just downloads the API information
from Weather Underground for the weather station given as an argument,
and then uses <tt  >sed</tt> (stream editor) to pare down the information to a
simple number&mdash;specifically, the numerical degrees in
Fahrenheit. If you
prefer Celsius, I applaud your country for adopting the metric system,
but sadly, my brain just can't relate Celsius to how warm the outdoor
temperature feels.
</p><p>
One tricky part is figuring out what the proper weather station ID is
for your city. I wish you could just use a ZIP code, but I've been unable to
find a command-line weather API that will take a ZIP code. So if you're
following along, just head
over to <a href="https://www.wunderground.com" target="_self">https://www.wunderground.com</a> and load the page for your locale. Once there,
click on the link shown in Figure 1 (your text will be different, but the
location on the page should match). The next page will show the name of
your local weather station. You can see mine in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12100f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. I assumed this was my weather station, but it's not. You need to
click through to find the code.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12100f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Here is the code for my local weather station. Be sure to try your
script on the command line to see if you have the correct code.
</p></div></div><p>
To get the local temperature using the script, just type the name
of the script (I named my &ldquo;gettemp&rdquo; and saved it as an executable in
/usr/local/bin/) with the name of the weather station as an argument:

<pre     class="programlisting">
spowers@cacti:~$ gettemp MAS614
48.0
spowers@cacti:~$ 
</pre>
</p><p>
The same script will work for Houston's weather too. I looked up a weather
station name in Houston and found &ldquo;KTXGALEN6&rdquo; as a name. Using that as
the argument, I can get the current temp for Houston. And, those will be
my two points of data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x1084e58"></a>
How Cacti Works</h2></div></div><p>
This is honestly the most frustrating part of the process. There are
so many different pieces to the Cacti puzzle, that it's easy to 
give up. Go ahead and install Cacti on your system (it should be in
the repository), and log in. The default login is usually
&ldquo;admin&rdquo;
for both login and password. You should change it immediately. 
</p><p>
Once
there, look along the left-hand side of the &ldquo;console&rdquo; page
(Figure 3), which
should load by default. The confusing part is that names like
&ldquo;devices&rdquo;,
&ldquo;data sources&rdquo;, &ldquo;data queries&rdquo; and such all sound like what you want to
configure to get data. 
I'm listing the definitions below, so hopefully it's
less confusing:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Data Queries:</b></span> this generally refers to
SNMP queries used to get data. I'm
not using this here, even though it sounds like something I'd need to
configure for doing data queries to a bash script.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Data Input Methods:</b></span> this is where you'll
configure your bash script if you're following along. Cacti
sees the script as a way to get data, not the data itself. This means you
can use the script (or Data Input Method) for multiple data sources. In
my case, I use the same Data Input Method for both Petoskey temps
and Houston temps.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Devices:</b></span> Cacti allows you to categorize data by device. This makes
sense if you're going to monitor server data from a bunch of different
servers. In this case, I'm not graphing different devices, so I won't
use the device categorization at all (I'll use &ldquo;none&rdquo; as the
device).
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Data Sources:</b></span> a data source uses a &ldquo;Data Input
Method&rdquo; to create a
graphable piece of data. For this example, I have two data sources: the Petoskey temp
and the Houston temp.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Data Templates:</b></span> this is a template that instructs Cacti on how to use
a Data Input Method to create a Data Source. Basically, you set up a
Data Template so Cacti knows what questions to ask when creating a Data
Source. It's possible to do without a Data Template, but if you don't
set one up, Cacti will give errors when creating a Data Source that
you'll need to go back and fix later. It's a real pain, but the step to
create a Data Template makes the process far less painful.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f3.large.jpg"><img src="12100f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Don't be overwhelmed; it's not nearly as scary as it looks.
</p></div></div><p>
Hopefully, that clears up some of the strange terminology. Graphing
is actually separate, so first you need to get your Data Sources
configured. (You'll make the graphs from your data sources, once they're
storing periodic data.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x10859b0"></a>
Part I: Data Input Method</h2></div></div><p>
For this example, even though I have two data sources, I have only one Data Input
Method. That means I need to configure the script in Cacti so that
it will accept an argument (the weather station code) for each data
source. So to do this, first click on &ldquo;Data Input Methods&rdquo; on the left, and then click
&ldquo;add&rdquo; on the upper-right corner of the Data Input Methods page. Look at
Figure 4 to see where the &ldquo;add&rdquo; link is, because it took me a long time to
find it at first!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f4.large.jpg"><img src="12100f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. It took me forever to figure out how to add something. I felt very
silly.
</p></div></div><p>
This is where you create the criteria for Cacti to &ldquo;call&rdquo; your
script. Figure 5 shows how to set up the information. Note that you must
use the &ldquo;Script/Command&rdquo; Input Type and that the placeholder for the
argument goes in &lt; &gt; brackets. The name of the Data Input Method is just a
friendly name, and the command-line argument in brackets gets a friendly
name too. (Also note that Cacti refers to the command-line argument as an
&ldquo;input
source&rdquo;, which isn't terribly descriptive in the case of a bash
script.)
Once filled in, click Create at the bottom.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f5.large.jpg"><img src="12100f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Be sure to select Script/Command!
</p></div></div><p>
The next page (Figure 6) looks similar, but you'll see that there are now
two more sections you need to complete. The first is the Input Fields
section. Click Add in the upper-right corner of that section, and
then tell the system what the script expects as input. In Figure 7, you can
see the Input Field from the last step is already selected. My example script
has only one argument, so it's the only option to choose. (Notice the
name is the same that I put in &lt;brackets&gt; in the last step.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f6.large.jpg"><img src="12100f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You need to configure an Input Field and an Output Field.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f7.large.jpg"><img src="12100f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. These error-checking features will come in handy for some scripts.
</p></div></div><p>
I added a friendly name for the Input Field, so when I'm configuring
the Data Sources later, it's clear what Cacti is looking for. If you want
to get fancy, you can use regex to sanitize the input, but I'm leaving that
blank. Also, since the script won't work without the weather station code,
I made sure the check box to allow empty input is not checked. The last
field also doesn't apply in this case, so I left it blank. Once you've chosen
a friendly name, click Create.
</p><p>
Next, click the Add link in the upper-right corner of the
&ldquo;Output Fields&rdquo;
box. You'll be taken to a screen that looks like Figure 8. Here, you're basically
applying a label to the output from your bash script. For this example, I
know I'll be
getting a number, so in the first field, I just called it
&ldquo;degrees&rdquo;, and
then I added a friendly name that described the output. The &ldquo;Update RRD
File&rdquo; is checked by default, and make sure to leave it checked.
That's
how Cacti knows this will be a graphable point of data! Once complete,
click Create.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f8.large.jpg"><img src="12100f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Just use a name that makes sense.
</p></div></div><p>
Your Data Input Method screen should now look like Figure 9. Be sure to
press Save at the bottom right of the window; otherwise, you'll lose
all of your work. If you click on &ldquo;Data Input Methods&rdquo; on the left column,
you should see your script added as a new Script/Command. Next, you can
use that Data Input Method to create your two data sources.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f9.large.jpg"><img src="12100f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Part II: Data Templates</h2></div></div><p>
If you head over to &ldquo;Data Templates&rdquo; in the left column and click
Add in the upper-right corner, you'll be presented with a screen that
looks similar to Figure 10. The idea behind a template is to answer as many
questions as possible, while leaving blanks for those items that will
be specific to each Data Source configured with the template. Looking
at Figure 10, note that I gave the template a friendly name at the top. The
next field, under Data Source, I left blank, but I checked the box that
says &ldquo;Use Per-Data Source Value&rdquo;, because I want the two data sources
to have different names. (It wouldn't be very useful if they both had
the same name.) Checking the box tells Cacti that when people use
the data template, you want them to come up with their own name. The
&ldquo;Data Input Method&rdquo; is the one you created if you were
following along in Part I&mdash;just find it in
the drop-down list. &ldquo;Associated RRAs&rdquo; tells Cacti which sets of data
it should track. Be sure to select all of these, because you want to be
able to create multiple graphs for historical data. Then,
&ldquo;Step&rdquo; refers
to how often it should poll the script for the temperature. The default
is five minutes (300 seconds), and I recommend leaving it. Finally in that
section, be sure &ldquo;Data Source Active&rdquo; is checked so that it actually
stores the data. Note that the last two fields in that section are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> checked
to use &ldquo;Per-User Data Source&rdquo;, because I want those values to be the
same for any data sources created with this template.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f10.large.jpg"><img src="12100f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Data Templates make it so much easier to create Data Sources.
</p></div></div><p>
The next section refers to the data items inside the RRD (round-robin
database) file. Since I'm tracking the temperature, I just decided to
call the field &ldquo;temp&rdquo; inside the file. I also don't want a maximum or
minimum value, so I put &ldquo;U&rdquo; in each of those fields. The
&ldquo;Data Source
Type&rdquo; field refers to the kind of data stored. In this case, it's a value that
fluctuates, and I want to compare the difference between them on a graph,
so the &ldquo;GAUGE&rdquo; type is what I want. Feel free to explore the other data
types, but for monitoring and graphing something like temperature, GAUGE
is what you should use. Finally, the &ldquo;Heartbeat&rdquo; field tells Cacti how long
it can go between data entries before it needs to fill in data points with
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo; (this defaults to ten minutes, and I suggest leaving
it). Also
note that none of the &ldquo;Use Per-Data Source&rdquo; check boxes are marked,
because these values will be the same for any data source using my
script. Click Create, and you should see Cacti provide another field
to fill in (Figure 11).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f11.large.jpg"><img src="12100f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Remember to fill in as much as you can, and check those boxes that
should be unique to each data source.
</p></div></div><p>
The &ldquo;Custom Data&rdquo; section that appears at the bottom comes
from the Data
Input Method that requires an input (the weather station code). Since
I want each data source to use its own code, I check the box to use
&ldquo;Per-Data Source&rdquo; and leave the field blank. Click Save, and
the data
source should be configured and ready to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x147f830"></a>
Part III: Data Sources</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have the Data Input Method and a Data Template to tell
Cacti how to use it, you need to create your two data sources. Head over to
&ldquo;Data Sources&rdquo; on the left, and then click &ldquo;Add&rdquo; in the upper right in
order to add your first source. The first page asks you to select a Data
Template and Host. This data source isn't related to a specific server,
so leave Host as &ldquo;none&rdquo;, but you want to select your freshly created
Data Template (Figure 12) and click Create.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f12.large.jpg"><img src="12100f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Cool, the data template!
</p></div></div><p>
Since the Data Template already answers most of the questions about the
new data source, you're asked only a few details. In Figure 13, you can see that
I need to name this data source, choose a data source path and give
it the weather station code. I just used the default Data Source Path
that Cacti created. Once you enter the name and weather station code,
click Save.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f13.large.jpg"><img src="12100f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. See? It's much easier to create a data source when you have only
two things
to enter!
</p></div></div><p>
If you're following along and want to do something similar to me, repeat
the process for your second weather station. Since the Data Template is
already in place, adding a second Data Source is very simple. I added
Houston exactly the same way as I added Petoskey.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x147fe60"></a>
Part IV: the Graphs</h2></div></div><p>
Creating the Data Sources is really the hardest part of creating graphs
with Cacti. Once they're created, the data will be polled every five minutes,
and data will be added to the RRD files. You can't create a graph until
you have a Data Source created, because graphs simply show the data
inside the Data Sources graphically. So, now that you have Data Sources,
you can create graphs to display them.
</p><p>
It's possible to set up Graph Templates, but unlike Data Templates,
they're not really required. In my case, since I created only one
graph, it would take longer to set up a template than simply to create
a graph from scratch, so I'll just do it from scratch. In order to start,
click on &ldquo;Manage Graphs&rdquo; on the left-hand side of the screen. (Note:
don't click &ldquo;New Graphs&rdquo;, because for some reason, Cacti will try to
use a host and not give you the option for selecting a Data Source that
doesn't have an associated host. Thankfully that isn't a problem in the
&ldquo;Graph Management&rdquo; section.)
</p><p>
Once in Graph Management, click &ldquo;Add&rdquo; in the upper-right corner. Select
&ldquo;None&rdquo; for both host and template (Figure 14), because you're not going
to use a template for this graph. Then click Create. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f14.large.jpg"><img src="12100f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. Graph Templates won't save you any time, but if you're doing lots of
similar graphs, check them out.
</p></div></div><p>
The next page
(Figure 15) looks overwhelming, but you're going to leave almost everything
at its default. The only things I added were the Title of the graph
(Petoskey &amp; Houston) and, at the bottom, the Vertical Label (degrees
Fahrenheit). For your first graph, I recommend leaving everything else
at its default. Click Create.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f15.large.jpg"><img src="12100f15.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. Thankfully, you want mostly all defaults.
</p></div></div><p>
The next page (Figure 16) looks similar, but notice the section I
circled in red titled &ldquo;Graph Items&rdquo;. You need to click
&ldquo;Add&rdquo; on the right
in that section, and add the Data Sources. You'll see I chose &ldquo;Houston
Temperature&rdquo; as the Data Source to graph (Figure 17). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f16.large.jpg"><img src="12100f16.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 16. I missed this section at first and was confused why I didn't get
any graphs.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f17.large.jpg"><img src="12100f17.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 17. Why on earth does the drop-down box show only HEX?
</p></div></div><p>
The second field is
to choose a color for the graph. Irritatingly, the drop-down menu 
shows only HEX codes for colors, but after you select one, it displays the
color for you. Houston is generally hot, so it seemed appropriate for
it to be red. Next is opacity, and I chose 100%. The &ldquo;Graph Item
Type&rdquo;
does not default to &ldquo;AREA&rdquo;, so be sure to select that for a traditional
graph that looks like a rolling hill of data. It's safe to leave
&ldquo;Consolidation Function&rdquo; to AVERAGE, and everything else the default. I did
add &ldquo;Houston Temp&rdquo; to the Text Format field, so it shows which color is
which Data Source on my graph. Once you're happy with the data, click
Create. Do the same thing with your second Data Source. You'll notice
in mine (Figure 18) that I chose blue for Petoskey, and instead of AREA, I chose
LINE1. It's a different type of graph, so that instead of filling the
page, it will draw a line with the temperature. I did that so Houston
would fill the background, and Petoskey would draw a line over the top
of it, so you can see both. Figure 19 shows the preview of what the graph
will look like. Be sure to click Save at the bottom!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f18.large.jpg"><img src="12100f18.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8c580.0x13918f8"></a>
That's It!</h2></div></div><p>
The only thing left to do is wait. Every five minutes, there should be a data
point added, and the graphs will update with a graphical representation of
that data. Cacti allows you to export the graphs to a local path (like
/var/www/html) or to a remote FTP server. If you don't have it export
the graphs, you'll have to log in to see them. I won't go through the
process for exporting the graphs, but click on the &ldquo;settings&rdquo; link on the
left column, and then the &ldquo;Graph Export&rdquo; tab across the top. The setup
is fairly self-explanatory. To see the graphs you've just created, wait
10&ndash;15 minutes, then follow the arrows as shown in Figure 20 to find the graphs. You
should see your new graphs starting to populate themselves with data!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12100f20.large.jpg"><img src="12100f20.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 20. These are frustrating to find; hopefully the arrows help you.
</p></div></div><p>
Cacti has lots of other features, and it allows you to customize your graphs
with min/max values displayed on the graphic, along with different types
of graphs, data sources and so on. Once you become familiar with using it, Cacti
is a very nice tool for automating the graphing process. I hope you
have as much fun with it as I did!
