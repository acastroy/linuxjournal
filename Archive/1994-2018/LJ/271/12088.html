<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Facebook Everything?!?!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #271, November 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When Facebook decided its messenger app would be an entirely separate
program from its regular app, I was ticked off. I didn't want to have
a second application in order to send private messages. It seemed like
a needless extra step. And, I stuck by that opinion until I realized I could
integrate regular SMS and MMS messages into Facebook Messenger.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12088androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Yes, this makes me a bit of a sellout, but I've found it incredibly
useful to have my Facebook messages and text (SMS/MMS) messages in one
place. There are people I often communicate with via Facebook, and people I
usually text. Thanks to Facebook Messenger acting as a client for both,
I can communicate from one application. Because using multiple apps for
Facebook was my initial beef with Facebook, allowing me to consolidate
texting and messaging actually makes me happy.
</p><p>
I know the idea of using Facebook Messenger for texting isn't everyone's
cup of tea. I didn't realize it was an option until recently, however,
and I am really enjoying how it works! You can see in my (slightly
blurred) screenshot, messages are differentiated by their icons. The
purple icon means it was an SMS or MMS, and the blue icon shows a
Facebook message. Even though it makes me feel a little like a sellout,
if you use both texting and Facebook messaging for communicating often,
I recommend giving it a try.

<h2 class="title">Be Kind, Buffer!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #271, November 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I like to tweet. Not like a bird (well, not usually), but
tweeting on Twitter. I like to post silly pictures and say silly
things. Unfortunately, a few things usually happen:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
I take a bunch of photos within minutes of each other.
</p></li><li><p>
I want to post to Twitter and Facebook.
</p></li><li><p>
People don't want to see ten tweets from me in rapid succession.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I used to use a complicated combination of Instagram, If This Then That
(<a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_self">https://ifttt.com</a>) and a third-party Twitter client in order to post once and have
it go to multiple social media sites. That didn't solve the problem of
posting too often. It also made posting plain text vs. photos challenging.
</p><p>
Thankfully, Buffer solves all my problems with a cool app and
website. Basically, you set up &ldquo;times&rdquo; throughout the day that you want
to post your tweets/Facebook posts. You can &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; as many posts as
you want, but the Buffer program will send them to the social-media
sites only one at a time, at the appointed scheduled time. It also will accept plain
text or photos, so I can use the same method for posting no matter what
the media.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088bufferf1.large.jpg"><img src="12088bufferf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
There are lots of interesting abilities too. For example, on the website,
you can have Buffer analyze your social-media accounts to find the best
time to post throughout the day. I actually prefer to set the times
myself, but if you're looking for maximum &ldquo;reach&rdquo; for your posts,
I imagine Buffer's algorithm is nice.
</p><p>
My favorite feature is that Buffer works on iOS, Android and the web. So
no matter where I am, or what device I'm using, I can post to my social-media sites and know they'll be delivered in a non-annoying way. There
also are paid features for folks who want more out of their social media,
especially for companies that use it as a part of their marketing. For
me though, the free features are absolutely perfect. Even if I had to pay,
however, I think I'd still give Buffer this month's Editors' Choice
award, because it has revolutionized the way I post to social media. And
to my Twitter followers: you can thank Buffer for my apparently improved
etiquette while posting!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Facebook on OS X, sans Browser!</h2>

I wrote about using Facebook Messenger as an SMS client for my
&ldquo;Android Candy&rdquo; piece this
month. And because I'll likely get lots of email about how horrible Facebook
messenger is, I might as well go all in and share this open-source program:
Messenger for Mac.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12088fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Over at <a href="https://fbmacmessenger.rsms.me" target="_self">https://fbmacmessenger.rsms.me</a>, you'll find an OS X-native
application that is a wrapper around Facebook Messenger. What makes it
great is that it doesn't feel like a wrapper at all; it feels like an
actual app. If you're using OS X and prefer applications rather than
just web browser tabs, be sure to check it out.
</p><p>
I'll be honest; I don't do a ton of communication via Facebook
Messenger. It's a great way to send a silly GIF sticker to my wife,
however, and for that reason alone, I appreciate the protocol! You can
download Messenger for Mac from the website above or from the GitHub
page: <a href="https://github.com/rsms/fb-mac-messenger" target="_self">https://github.com/rsms/fb-mac-messenger</a>.

<h2 class="title">Editing Your Own OpenStreet Maps</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #271, November 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
JOSM (Java OpenStreetMaps) editor is a tool you can use to
create your own maps
(<a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de" target="_self">https://josm.openstreetmap.de</a>). This tool
allows you to build your own maps based on data from OpenStreetMaps,
other online sources or your own data. You can make edits, add
annotations and upload your results back on to the OpenStreetMaps
server. 
</p><p>
There are two ways you can run JOSM. The first is to install it
on your system. If you have it within your package management system,
you may want to install that way so any required dependencies are
installed automatically. For example, the following command will install
it on Debian-based systems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install josm josm-plugins
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the above command also installs the package of
plugins for JOSM. A large number of plugins are available from the
community on the main project's website. 
And, if you want the latest version of JOSM,
you can download a jar file from the project's website. 
</p><p>
The second way to
run JOSM is actually using a Java Web Start package. You simply launch the
JNLP file, again from the main project's website.
</p><p>
Once you have started JOSM, in whichever way you have chosen to launch
it, you will get a window with an information panel about updates and
startup information. There also are links to online help
information and the community forums. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf1.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start JOSM, you get an information panel.
</p></div></div><p>
Now you can start creating your
first map. The easiest way to get started is to download OpenStreetMap
data as a starting point. Clicking on the File&rarr;Download from
OSM menu item will pop up a new window where you can select an area to use
as your map base. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf2.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can select and download an area of the Earth as your map base.
</p></div></div><p>
At the top of this window, you can choose
what data to download. The choices are OSM data, raw GPS data and
additional notes. Within the map window, you can pan around to the area
of interest and zoom in to an appropriate level. You then click and drag
with your mouse to select a box of the area that you want to use in your
map. Be careful with how big a bounding box you select,
because the data server limits how much data you can pull at once. Luckily,
you will get a warning at the bottom of the window if the bounding box
is too large. 
</p><p>
Once you have made your selection, you either can click on
the download button to download it as a new map, or you can click the
option &ldquo;Download as a new layer&rdquo; at the bottom of the map pane first to
add this data to an already existing map. For now, let's just click
the download button to get a brand-new map started.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf3.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can download OpenStreetMaps data to start a brand-new map.
</p></div></div><p>
Looking at the new map, you can see that there is a lot of information
available and a lot of functionality you can use to interact with
that information. On the left-hand side, there is a strip of icon buttons
you can choose from to interact with the map data. The right-hand
side has several panes that can show the layers and detailed
information of selected objects on the map. You can change which panes
are visible on the right-hand side by clicking the Windows menu item
and selecting the panes that interest you. If you select an
object on the map, such as a road section or water way, the details of
that selected object will show up in the information panes on the right-hand side.
</p><p>
Raw geographical information is not the only data source that is
available to you. Clicking the Imagery menu item gives you a menu of
possible data sources where you can download geographical images. You can
change this list by clicking the Imagery&rarr;Imagery
Preferences menu item and selecting the sources you want to use. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf4.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can select the data sources used for downloading geographical
imagery data.
</p></div></div><p>
In Figure 5, I selected the Imagery&rarr;OpenStreetMap
Carto (Standard layer) menu item to get the cartographic imagery for my map
area. You can choose the layer you want to work on by
selecting it in the Layers pane at the top of the right-hand side. You
also can change the order in which the layers are stacked or change whether
they are visible. If you have your own imagery available, you
can click on the Imagery&rarr;Rectified Image menu item to select the
server from which your imagery is served.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf5.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can add multiple layers with satellite imagery or
cartographic imagery.
</p></div></div><p>
What I have covered so far is fine if you just want static maps of
pre-existing data, but that isn't very interesting. The last bit of
functionality I want to cover here is how to add your own data to these maps. 
</p><p>
You
can add nodes, or a series of nodes, by selecting the appropriate
tool from the list of icons at the top of the left-hand side. When you
add a node, you can tag it as a particular type of node or group of
nodes. You can access several preset types by
clicking the Presets menu item. These presets include natural objects,
man-made objects and lots of geological features. This allows you to
start adding tracks, objects and other features that are based on local
knowledge, which means that you can create very specialized maps of
your area.
</p><p>
Clicking the Edit&rarr;Preferences menu item brings up the preferences
window for JOSM. You can tweak several options to change
how JOSM works. The Map Settings tab lets you change the
main display options, such as the projection or the mapping styles
available for use in JOSM. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf6.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The preferences window lets you tweak a lot of the functionality
in JOSM.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf7.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The Map Settings tab lets you select and download alternate
mapping styles for your map display.
</p></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, 
a large selection of plugins is available from the community of JOSM
users. You can access this library from the Plugins tab, where you
can download and activate the plugins that interest you. 
Once you start looking at the available options, you'll
see that there is a lot of extended functionality available for doing
some serious work with your maps.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088josmf8.large.jpg"><img src="12088josmf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Plugins tab lets you select from a large library of
available plugins.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you are happy with a map, you'll want to save your
work. JOSM can save all of the data related to your map in one of many
different geographical file formats. Clicking on File&rarr;Save
As pops up a save window where you can select from file formats
such as GPX, GeoJSON or OSM Server Files. You also can upload changes
back to the OpenStreetMaps servers if you are adding previously unknown
information.

<h2 class="title">Now &ldquo;Slack&rdquo;-ing Off is Encouraged!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #271, November 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If your company hasn't already chosen to utilize <a href="https://slack.com" target="_self">https://slack.com</a>, it's probably
only a matter of time. For anyone who has been around IRC before,
Slack might seem like a total ripoff. I'll be honest, when one of the
companies I work for starting using it, I wasn't impressed, because I
could do all the same things with IRC.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12088slackf1.large.jpg"><img src="12088slackf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I was wrong&mdash;at least partially. Slack is certainly an IRC-like
communication tool that is perfect for communicating with other people in
an organization. What makes it special is its ability to integrate with
other services so well. Things like Google-based authentication for single-sign-in is simple to configure. It also has a very robust API, so you can
integrate countless third-party tools into your Slack environment. Some
of them are silly (like adding GIPHY so you can insert animated GIF
files into your conversations), and some are incredibly useful (like
triggering remote scripts to give you real-time feedback in a chat window).
</p><p>
Plus, if you're like me and you can't do without IRC, it's possible
to integrate IRC into your Slack experience using Sameroom (<a href="https://sameroom.io" target="_self">https://sameroom.io</a>). Truly
it's the ability to integrate with other services that makes Slack so
powerful, and its ease of use makes it popular for companies, even when
the employees aren't all IT folks. Check it out today if you're looking
for a great way to communicate with groups of people in your life that
might not appreciate the nuances of IRC!
