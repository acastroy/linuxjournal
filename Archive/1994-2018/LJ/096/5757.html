an Iomega Zip 250MB drive for parallel ports [&ldquo;Maragda: Running
Linux from a CD&rdquo; by Jordi Bataller, <i  >LJ</i> March
2001]. I notice you were successful and wonder if you care to share
your knowledge in this area. The PCs in our lab have internal 100MB
IDE zip drives. Thank you for your great article and any assistance
you can provide.</p><p>&mdash;David Cooper</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jordi replies:</b></span> Running a
Linux distribution installed on an Iomega Zip disk works and is
usable, but it is slow compared to other solutions. The basics to
make it work are the same as in the CD-ROM case, but you need a
floppy (1.44) disk to boot it. Besides the slow speed, capacity is
another drawback. I used a 250MB disk and still have to cut down
the contents. There are other solutions available: running it from
a CD-ROM (see
<a href="http://www.iti.upv.es/~maragda" target="_self">www.iti.upv.es/~maragda</a>)
and using a parallel box enclosing a common IDE hard disk. This is
a box connected to the parallel port, which interfaces a standard
IDE hard disk. I used this solution for over a year with no
problems (of course it is a bit slower). It is easy to create and
the only problem is developing a bootable floppy disk. The
installation is trivial; I connected the disk directly to the IDE
bus. Once Linux is installed you remove the disk from the bus and
put it into the box. It is cheap, since you can reuse old IDE disks
and probably can find boxes for $60-$80 US. There are also other
types of box adaptors. I'm waiting for an IDE-to-USB box; well I'm
waiting for the developers of the Linux kernel USB support to patch
some bugs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137d580.0x1475450"></a>One Cool Guy</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to say that I enjoyed the January 2002 issue of

<i  >LJ</i> February 2002], Doc Searls ends his review
of misguided prognostications with a July 1976 ad for the Altair
8800 in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Popular Electronics</em></span>. True, this early
microcomputer did not succeed. But it was at the center of a
significant milestone in the development of the personal
computer&mdash;a milestone that will impact the growth of Linux for
years to come. The Altair 8800 was chosen by two young Harvard
University students as the platform for the first microcomputer,
Basic interpreter. The older of the two, Paul Allen, simulated the
Altair instruction set on a DEC PDP-20 and was pleasantly surprised
when his interpreter, stored on paper tape, actually worked when he
brought it to MITS in Albuquerque. He and his younger colleague
thereby were able to start a software company. Mr. Allen eventually
left the company, but his partner, Bill Gates, has become the
wealthiest man in the world from that company, Microsoft. (Mr.
Allen is not far behind.)</p><p>&mdash;Jay Braun</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137d580.0x14759d0"></a>Mozilla Corrective</h2></div></div><p>There is a small mistake in the February 2002 issue of

that you can specify a minimum font size for Mozilla with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
user_pref(font.minimum-size.x-western, 13);
</pre><p>On my system (running Mozilla 0.9.7) I need to place quotes
around the first argument:
<pre     class="programlisting">
user_pref("font.minimum-size.x-western", 13);

Otherwise, I get the following error:
<pre     class="programlisting">
