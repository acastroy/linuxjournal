    Mick examines sendmail's security controversies and builds an
    SMTP gateway for handling internet mail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe65450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ah, sendmail. You either love it for
being so versatile and ubiquitous, or you hate it for being
bloated, complicated and insecure. Or perhaps you're a complete
newcomer to the e-mail server game and would like to give sendmail
a try (after all, sendmail is arguably the most popular open-source
software package on the Internet).</p><p>Well, contrary to popular belief, sendmail isn't a total loss
where security is concerned, nor does it require learning the
arcane syntax of sendmail.cf (although hardcore sendmail gurus do
indeed master it). This month we examine these and other sendmail
security controversies, using sendmail's handy m4 macros to rapidly
build a secure but functional Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
gateway to handle internet mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe655b0"></a>Why (or Why Not) Use Sendmail?</h2></div></div><p>Sendmail is one of the most venerable internet software
packages still in widespread use. It first appeared in 4.1c BSD
UNIX (April 1983), and to this day it has remained the most
relied-upon application of its kind. Among message transfer agents
(MTAs), sendmail is the great workhorse of the Internet,
transferring e-mail between networks dependably and (to end users)
transparently. But sendmail has both advantages and
disadvantages.</p><p>On the good side, sendmail has a huge user community, with
the result that it's easy to find both free and commercial support
for it, not to mention a wealth of electronic and print
publications. It's also stable and predictable, due to its
maturity.</p><p>On the negative side, sendmail has acquired a certain amount
of cruft (old code) over its long history, with the result that it
has a reputation of being insecure and bloated. Both charges are
open to debate, however. It's true that it has had a number of
significant vulnerabilities over the years. However, these have
been brought to light and fixed rapidly.</p><p>As for the &ldquo;bloatware&rdquo; charge, it's true that sendmail has
a much larger code base than other MTAs such as qmail and Postfix,
and a larger RAM footprint too. This probably has at least as much
to do with the fact that sendmail is monolithic (one executable
provides most of sendmail's functionality) as it does with cruft.
Indeed, sendmail's code has been scrutinized so closely by so many
programmers over the years that it's a little hard to believe that
too much cruft (i.e., code that is strictly historical and
obsolete) has survived intact over the past 20 years.</p><p>It's much more useful to observe that being monolithic,
sendmail must run as root if <span   class="emphasis"><em>any portion</em></span> of
its required functionality does, i.e., writing mail to multiple
users' home directories. For this reason, sendmail can run only as
an unprivileged user on systems on which it's to act solely as an
e-mail relay or gateway.</p><p>Sendmail also is criticized for its complexity. The syntax of
its configuration file, sendmail.cf, is non-instinctive to say the
least&mdash;in my opinion, its difficulty ranks somewhere between C
programming and regular expressions. As with these, this is because
of how powerful sendmail is (though many of us do wish sendmail
used C, regular expressions or some other standard configuration
language in sendmail.cf rather than its own equally complex but
much more proprietary syntax). Nowadays, though, this point is
largely moot. Recent versions of sendmail can be configured via m4
macros, which provide a much less user-hostile experience than
editing sendmail.cf directly.</p><p><a href="5753s1.html" target="_self">Mick's Disclaimer</a></p><p>Regardless of one's opinions on sendmail, it's unquestionably
a powerful and well-supported piece of software. If sendmail's
benefits are more compelling to you than the negatives, you're in
good company. But you'll be in even <span   class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span>
company if you learn to run sendmail securely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe65a28"></a>Sendmail Architecture</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, sendmail is monolithic in that it does
all its real work with one executable, sendmail. Sendmail has two
modes of operation: it can be invoked as needed, in which case it
will process any queued mail and then quit; or it can be run as a
persistent background d&aelig;mon.</p><p>D&aelig;mon mode is required only when sendmail's role is to
receive mail from external hosts; if all you use sendmail for is
sending mail, you shouldn't run sendmail as a d&aelig;mon, and in
fact you can probably stop reading now, because sendmail really
doesn't need any customization to do this unless you wish to run it
chroot-ed.</p><p>The way sendmail works, then, depends on how it's being run.
If it's running as a d&aelig;mon (i.e., with the -bd flag), it
listens for incoming SMTP connections on TCP port 25 and
periodically tries to send any outbound messages in its queue
directory /var/spool/mqueue. If it's being invoked on the fly, it
attempts to deliver the outbound message it's been invoked to send
and/or checks /var/spool/mqueue for other pending outbound
messages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe65be0"></a>The Task at Hand</h2></div></div><p>Before we go any further, I should make clear what we're
about to build. I've chosen the SMTP gateway scenario because it's
such a common role for sendmail and because it's so dependent on
good security (in most organizations, publicly accessible mail
servers face scarier if not more numerous threats than internal
mail servers do).</p><p>An SMTP gateway typically needs meticulous attention to
privilege levels, file permissions and in general, only as much
enabled functionality as is needed to route mail. On such a host,
sendmail should run as an unprivileged user where possible; it
should run chroot-ed (in a subset of /) at least when writing
files, and it should be configured to relay mail only for your
organization, not for spammers.</p><p>It takes very little tweaking to harden sendmail on Red Hat 7
for SMTP gateway use and only a little more on SuSE and other
distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe65d98"></a>Obtaining and Installing Sendmail</h2></div></div><p>I can state with absolute certainty that your Linux
distribution of choice includes one or more packages for sendmail.
Whether it's presently installed on your system and whether it's an
appropriate version for you to use, however, is another
matter.</p><p>If you use an RPM-based distribution (Red Hat, Mandrake,
SuSE, etc.), you can see whether you've got sendmail installed and
which version by issuing the command <b  >rpm -qv
sendmail</b>. Note that Red Hat and its derivatives split
sendmail into three packages: sendmail, sendmail-cf and
sendmail-doc. SuSE uses a single package, sendmail.</p><p>So, what version should you run? As of this writing, the
latest version of sendmail is 8.12.2. Red Hat 7 and SuSE 7,
however, still support variants of sendmail version 8.11. As far as
I can tell, there's nothing wrong with sticking with your
distribution's supported sendmail package if it's version 8.11.0 or
higher. There were no major security problems in the 8.10 or 8.11
releases; 8.11, in fact, was a &ldquo;features&rdquo; release: rather than
being released to patch security holes, it was released because the
sendmail team had added support for TLS encryption and for the SMTP
AUTH extension to SMTP.</p><p>If you've got the time and/or inclination, though, it's never
a bad idea to compile and install the latest stable version. For
sanity's sake, I'll assume for the remainder of this article that
you're using sendmail 8.10.0 or higher (unless otherwise
noted).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe66000"></a>Note to Debian Users</h2></div></div><p>Debian GNU/Linux v2.2 (Potato) still supports sendmail
v.8.9.3. Although this is a stable and apparently secure release,
it's now two major versions old (if one considers the second
numeral to represent a major version, which I do because the first
numeral has been eight for half a decade). In addition, 8.9.3
doesn't support TLS or SMTP AUTH.</p><p>If you want TLS or SMTP AUTH, or are uncomfortable running an
older version, you always can uninstall the package, download the
latest source code tarball from
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org" target="_self">www.sendmail.org</a> and
compile and install sendmail from source. The source code tarball
is well documented and compiles easily under Linux, assuming you've
got a working gcc installation.</p><p>Once you've installed sendmail, either in the form of a
binary package from your distribution or from a source code tarball
you've compiled yourself, you've still got a couple of tasks left
before you can configure and run the sendmail executable as a
d&aelig;mon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe66210"></a>SuSE Sendmail Preparation</h2></div></div><p>If you're a SuSE user, become root if you aren't already.
Next, open /etc/rc.config with your text editor of choice and set
the variable SMTP to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. This is necessary for sendmail's
startup script in /etc/init.d to run at boot time.</p><p>In addition, you need to edit the file
/etc/rc.config.d/sendmail.rc.config so that the variable
SENDMAIL_TYPE is set to &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Doing so essentially will disable
SuSEconfig's use of /etc/rc.config.d/sendmail.rc.config, which in
other circumstances can be set up to generate a simple sendmail
configuration automatically. We're going to set up an SMTP
gateway/relay, which is a bit beyond the scope of
sendmail.rc.config. But if your host is to act only as a simple
SMTP server for its own local users, it will probably suffice to
edit this file (having first set its SENDMAIL_TYPE variable to
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;); if so, you'll find sendmail.rc.config's full
documentation in /etc/mail/README.</p><p>After editing rc.config and sendmail.rc.config, run
SuSEconfig. This will propagate the changes you just made to
rc.config and sendmail.rc.config. To start the d&aelig;mon you can
enter the command <b  >/etc/init.d/sendmail start</b>,
but I recommend you wait until sendmail is fully configured before
you do so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe66420"></a>Red Hat Sendmail Preparation</h2></div></div><p>If you're a Red Hat user, you have only one step prior to
configuring sendmail: edit /etc/sysconfig/sendmail so that the
variable DAEMON is set to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. This will tell the startup
script /etc/init.d/sendmail to start sendmail as a d&aelig;mon at
boot time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0xe66528"></a>Configuring Sendmail</h2></div></div><p>And now, at last, we configure sendmail to act as our
domain's SMTP gateway. What follows applies to any installation of
sendmail 8.9 or higher (you shouldn't in any circumstances run
8.8).</p><p>The simplified method of generating sendmail configurations
(sendmail.cf and accompanying files) consists of these
steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Enable needed features in sendmail.mc.</p></li><li><p>Set up domain-name masquerading, if needed, in
sendmail.mc.</p></li><li><p>Run <b  >m4</b> to generate sendmail.cf
from sendmail.mc.</p></li><li><p>Configure delivery rules by editing
mailertable.</p></li><li><p>Configure relaying rules by editing access.</p></li><li><p>Configure local user-aliases in aliases.</p></li><li><p>Convert mailertable, access and aliases to
databases.</p></li><li><p>Define all local hostnames in
local-host-names.</p></li><li><p>(Re)start sendmail.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0x125efb8"></a>Notable Settings in sendmail.mc</h2></div></div><p>The first and probably longest task in setting up an SMTP
gateway is generating /etc/sendmail.cf. This is done most easily by
editing /etc/mail/sendmail.mc (or on SuSE systems,
/etc/mail/linux.mc&mdash;it may be different on other
distributions).</p><p>Depending on which Linux distribution you use, configuration
information for sendmail.mc can be found in
/usr/share/doc/sendmail/README.cf (Red Hat and its derivatives),
/usr/share/sendmail/README (SuSE) or some variant thereof. I don't
have enough space to describe the syntax of the many settings in
this file in detail. We will, however, look at some that are useful
for security and for modularizing our configuration a bit.</p><p>In addition to sendmail.cf itself, we can configure sendmail
to read several other files for configuration information. This is
useful for two reasons. First, editing sendmail.cf directly is
unpleasant and even regenerating it from sendmail.mc isn't always
desirable. Second, if your SMTP gateway has multiple administrators
with varying privileges, you may wish to keep sendmail.mc and
sendmail.cf locked down but allow other administrators to edit user
aliases or mail delivery rules (i.e., /etc/mail/access and
/etc/mail/mailertable, respectively).</p><p>The most useful external configuration files to enable are
mailertable, which defines local mail-delivery rules;
virtusertable, which defines virtual domain mappings on a per-user
and per-domain level; and access, which defines which hosts may use
the server as an SMTP relay.</p><p>The sendmail.mc directives for enabling these files are shown
below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FEATURE(`mailertable',`hash -o
        /etc/mail/mailertable.db')dnl
FEATURE(`virtusertable',`hash -o
        /etc/mail/virtusertable.db')dnl
FEATURE(`access_db',`hash -o
        /etc/mail/access.db')dnl
</pre><p>(Note that the mailertable and access_db features are enabled
by default under Red Hat, but that virtusertable must be added
manually.)
</p><p>Each of these lines tells sendmail to reference the specified
file (although the access database is called access, not
access_db), to use a hash database and the path of the respective
file. We'll see how to use these files shortly, but first we've got
a few more things to attend to in sendmail.mc.</p><p>If your users' e-mail addresses are generic to your domain
rather than specific to the hosts they log on to, for example,
mick@polkatistas.org rather than mick@myron.polkatistas.org, you
probably want the From: fields of their outbound e-mail to reflect
this. (Receiving e-mail addressed to those generic names requires
user aliases&mdash;see below.)</p><p>Following are some sendmail.mc lines that tell our example
SMTP gateway to rewrite the From: fields of polkatistas.org's users
in this manner. All the lines in the example below must be added
(or uncommented):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MASQUERADE_AS(`polkatistas.org')dnl
MASQUERADE_DOMAIN(`.polkatistas.org')dnl
EXPOSED_USER(`root')dnl
FEATURE(`masquerade_entire_domain')dnl
FEATURE(`masquerade_envelope')dnl
</pre><p>The MASQUERADE_AS directive specifies the fully qualified
domain name you wish to appear in applicable From: addresses. The
MASQUERADE_DOMAIN directive specifies the hosts to which
MASQUERADE_AS is applicable. Note that the &ldquo;.&rdquo; preceding
polkatistas.org indicates that all hostnames with this domain name
are to be masqueraded.
</p><p>EXPOSED_USER specifies a user name for whom the From: address
should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be masqueraded.
<span   class="bold"><b>root</b></span> is a popular candidate for
this because e-mail from root often contains alerts and warnings;
if you receive one, you generally want to know which host sent
it.</p><p>The feature masquerade_entire_domain causes MASQUERADE_DOMAIN
to be interpreted as an entire domain rather than a hostname;
masquerade_envelope applies the masquerading not only to the SMTP
header but to the envelope as well.</p><p>Four other directives, one logistical and the other three
security-related, are shown in Listing 1. The always_add_domain
feature is enabled by default under Red Hat and SuSE; use_cw_file
and smrsh are enabled in Red Hat but not SuSE; confSAFE_FILE_ENV
always must be defined manually.</p><p><a href="5753l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Some More Sendmail
Features</a></p><p>The always_add_domain feature simply forces the local host's
domain name to be appended to any e-mail originating from a host
that identifies itself without a domain. For example, if the SMTP
gateway receives mail from the user &ldquo;bobo&rdquo; on a host identified
only as &ldquo;whoopeejohn&rdquo;, sendmail will rewrite the From: field to
read bobo@whoopeejohn.polkatistas.org rather than bobo@whoopeejohn
(but of course masquerading directives still apply).</p><p>The use_cw_file feature tells sendmail to refer to the file
/etc/mail/local-host-names for a list of hostnames sendmail should
consider local. The file /etc/mail/local-host-names is a text file
containing hostnames listed one per line. Suppose our example SMTP
gateway receives e-mail not only for the domain polkatistas.org,
but also tubascoundrels.net. If our gateway's hostname is &ldquo;mail&rdquo;,
then its local-host-names file will look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
localhost.localdomain
mail.polkatistas.org
mail.tubascoundrels.net
</pre><p>The third feature enabled in Listing 1 is smrsh, the sendmail
restricted shell. This is an important security control that
restricts the commands that may be executed from a user's .forward
file.
</p><p>The fourth line in Listing 1 tells sendmail to set
sendmail.cf's SafeFileEnvironment variable to, you guessed it, some
subdirectory of / that sendmail will chroot to (sort of). Actually,
this only will happen when sendmail writes files. If you think
about it, though, this 50% chroot makes sense: file-writes are what
we're probably most worried about, and creating this sort of chroot
environment is a lot simpler than your typical chroot jail (which
must contain copies of every file hierarchy, file, executable and
device your chroot-ed program needs).</p><p>Listing 2 shows a recursive listing (<b  >ls
-lR</b>) of my example SafeFileEnvironment
/var/mailjail.</p><p><a href="5753l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Contents of
/var/mailjail</a></p><p>Sendmail created the files
/var/mailjail/var/spool/mqueue/bobo and .../root. Beforehand, I had
created the entire chroot jail with only four commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /var/mailjail/var/spool/mail
/var/mailjail/var/spool/mqueue
cd /var/mailjail
chown -R mail:mail *
chmod -R 700 *
</pre><p>If you're concerned about unsolicited commercial e-mail,
there's some good news. By default, sendmail doesn't allow SMTP
relaying, a common technique of spammers. This can be disabled in
sendmail.mc, but you won't find out how from me. Leave this alone.
In addition, you can direct sendmail to reject mail from known
sources of spam, per the Realtime Blackhole List (RBL), by adding
or uncommenting this line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
FEATURE(`dnsbl')
</pre>


For this to work, however, you need to subscribe to the RBL. See
Resources for a link to its home page, where you'll find
subscription and use instructions and some important disclaimers.
(Note that while RBL subscriptions are free for &ldquo;Individual/Hobby
Sites&rdquo;, there is a fee-schedule associated with this service.)
Using the RBL can block e-mail from some legitimate users as well
as from spammers, so proceed with caution.
</p><p>If you run Red Hat 7.1 or 7.2, there's one more sendmail.mc
parameter to check, this time one that needs to be commented out.
If your /etc/mail/sendmail.mc contains a line like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')
</pre><p>Then you need to comment it out by appending the string dnl
to the beginning of the line. If active, this line will cause
sendmail to accept only connections on the loopback interface and
not from external hosts. Needless to say, for an SMTP gateway this
is undesirable (though it unquestionably enhances security).
</p><p>Those are the most important sendmail.mc settings for our
purposes. There are others relevant to security, especially for
nongateway roles (local delivery, etc.). For more information see
the README.cf or README file I alluded to at the beginning of this
section.</p><p>To compile our macro-configuration file into sendmail.cf, we
use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc &gt; /etc/sendmail.cf
</pre><p>If your macro-configuration file's name isn't sendmail.mc,
substitute it with linux.mc or whatever your macro-configuration
file is called. Sendmail expects its configuration file to be named
sendmail.cf; however, it looks for it in /etc, so that part of the
command is the same regardless of your distribution or even your
version of sendmail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd6d580.0x125fdd0"></a>Configuring Delivery Rules</h2></div></div><p>That was the hard part. Now we only need to tell sendmail
what to do with incoming mail, what local hostnames are legitimate
and which users, networks and domains may use the SMTP gateway to
relay mail not destined locally.</p><p>The mailertable is used to define delivery rules. It has a
simple syntax, which is described in
/usr/share/doc/sendmail/README.cf or /usr/share/sendmail/README
depending on your distribution. In a nutshell, each line contains
two parts: a destination identifier and an action. The destination
identifier matches destination addresses or parts thereof; the
action tells sendmail what to do with messages whose destinations
match the identifier.</p><p>If the identifier begins with a &ldquo;.&rdquo;, then all e-mail source
addresses ending in whatever follows the dot will match. If it
doesn't, then everything following the &ldquo;@&rdquo; sign must be identical
to the identifier. The e-mail address bobo@weird-al.polkatistas.org
won't match the identifier polkatistas.org but will match
.polkatistas.org.</p><p>The action takes the form
<span   class="emphasis"><em>agent</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span> where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>agent</em></span> is either a mailer (defined in
sendmail.mc/linux.mc in MAILER() statements) or the built-in agents
&ldquo;local&rdquo; or &ldquo;error&rdquo;. The &ldquo;local&rdquo; agent, of course, means the
mail should be delivered to a local user, specified after the colon
(if nothing follows the colon, the user specified in the message
itself will be used).</p><p>Below is a mailertable with two different actions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
polkatistas.org       smtp:internalmail.polkatistas.org
mail.polkatistas.org  local:postmaster
</pre><p>In addition to delivery rules, sendmail needs to know which
e-mail destinations should be considered synonyms of the local
(SMTP gateway's) hostname. These are specified in
/etc/mail/local-host-names, one per line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mail.polkatistas.org
weird-al.polkatistas.org
1.23.234.2
</pre>


Finally, we need to define allowed relayers by editing
/etc/mail/access. The syntax is simple. Each line contains a source
name or address, paired with an action (again, see README.cf or its
equivalent on your distribution for details). The action can be
RELAY, REJECT, DISCARD, OK or ERROR. In practice, the most useful
of these actions is RELAY. Because by default relaying is rejected,
REJECT and DISCARD are only useful when defining exceptions to
explicit RELAY rules.
</p><p>Here is a simple access file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
localhost.localdomain           RELAY
localhost                       RELAY
127.0.0.1                       RELAY
192.168                         RELAY
</pre><p>Do you notice the absence of real hostnames in the example
above? In this example, the SMTP gateway performs only outbound
relays; inbound mail must be addressed to a local e-mail address,
and outbound relays must originate from hosts whose IP addresses
begin with the octets 192.168 (obviously a noninternet-routable
network). I like this technique (using IP addresses) because then I
can prevent IP address spoofing with my firewall rules, but I can't
prevent forged From: addresses in e-mail (however, your needs may
be different of course):
<pre     class="programlisting">
access
local-host-names

authentication to SMTP transactions, e.g., to determine whether to
permit relaying. This is especially useful when systems or users
don't run their own MTA but need to send mail, i.e., need to relay
outbound mail through a central gateway.</p><p>If you're running an SMTP server that relays mail from other
domains, you probably want this feature, as it's an important
defense against unsolicited commercial e-mail, the perpetrators of
which rely heavily on SMTP relays.</p><p>There's just one more file that may need tweaking: aliases.
This file contains a map of e-mail aliases to user names. Usually
an SMTP gateway doesn't need a very granular alias database; to
translate entire domains' (or virtual domains') e-mail addresses
you're better off using the user database (which, sadly, I don't
have space to cover). It's fairly self-explanatory, though, so edit
it if you need to.</p><p>Now three of the four files we've just discussed,
mailertable, access and aliases, actually can't be used by sendmail
directly; they must first be converted to databases. The /etc/mail
file contains a handy Makefile for this purpose. To use it simply
change your working directory to /etc/mail and enter this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Make access.db mailertable.db
</pre><p>Note that this won't work for aliases, which has its own
utility, newaliases. Run newaliases without any flags to convert
your changed /etc/aliases file into a new /etc/aliases.db file
automatically.
</p><p>And that's it for now. There's much I haven't covered,
notably the smrsh shell (applicable mainly to local mail delivery,
not to gateways). But hopefully I've given you some useful hints
and pointers to more complete sources of information. Good
luck!</p><p><a href="5753s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
