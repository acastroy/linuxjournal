<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5751f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>We all know Big Blue is spending a billion dollars on Linux
because a visible hunk of that money is being spent on advertising
and promotion.</p><p>Less obvious is how the Chinese government, representing more
than 1.2 billion people, is expressing its own love of Linux by
encouraging adoption of its own distribution: Red Flag
Linux.</p><p>Red Flag was created in 1999 by the Academy of Science, which
is headed by Jiang Mianheng, son of President Jiang Zemin, with
financial assistance from the government-owned Shanghai NewMargin
Venture Capital.</p><p>Red Flag's purpose is to prevent increased domination of the
Chinese computer market by Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
The best way to do that, as the Chinese government sees it, is to
promulgate an already popular alternative with &ldquo;full transparency
in terms of underlying code&rdquo;, as one commentator described it.
They are doing this by encouraging state institutions and
state-owned companies to adopt Red Flag Linux.</p><p>And that's just one strategy. Another is to avoid copyright
infringement and &ldquo;software piracy&rdquo; issues by promoting use of
software that avoids the issue. Another is by purchasing software
from domestic companies that build on Linux rather than
Windows.</p><p>According to Gartner, the Beijing municipal government gave
contracts to six local vendors and rejected the seventh: Microsoft.
One of the six was Red Flag.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Linux is now showing up in quantity on
desktops, at least in retail stores.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>On a recent trip to China, I noticed that many of
the Intel-compatible PCs for sale in several major department
stores had a slightly different appearance than usual, apart from
the language differences. I looked closely and realized they were
running GNU/Linux</p></blockquote></div><p>writes Dan Gillmor of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury
News</em></span>.

Marketplace and the Kernel List</h2></div></div><p>At Linux WorldExpo in August 1999, I met with some IBM folks
who conveyed the company's cautious interest in the operating
system. Linux had been arriving &ldquo;over the transom&rdquo;, they said,
showing up significantly (though nonstrategically) in servers all
over the company. So IBM did a survey of one division, testing
Linux &ldquo;awareness&rdquo; on a scale that ran from &ldquo;can spell Linux&rdquo; at
one end and &ldquo;hacks kernel code&rdquo; at the other. All 600 surveyed
could spell Linux, and 120 were hacking kernel code. It was a
revelation that no doubt informed the company's strategic
commitment to the OS.</p><p>Now it's 2.5 years later, and Linux is a mainstream operating
system. That was the summary news story from the latest LinuxWorld
Expo (just completed as I write this).</p><p>IBM showed off marquee customers L.L. Bean, Boscov, Pixar and
Solomon Smith Barney. Hewlett-Packard showcased DreamWorks SKG.
Egenera reported a deal with Credit Suisse First Boston.</p><p>In her keynote at LWE, Carly Fiorina of HP said 2002 would be
a &ldquo;breakout&rdquo; year for Linux, pointing to a Gartner projection of
15% growth, despite the economic downturn. HP also announced Linux
products for enterprise and telecommunications customers,
showcasing Amazon, BMW, Boeing, Speedera, ViaWest and
Verizon.</p><p>Also at LWE, Holger Dyroff of SuSE said, &ldquo;Up to now Linux
was adopted by technicians. Now it's exactly the opposite.&rdquo; CIOs
are placing orders for SuSE support contracts on IBM mainframes at
a rate of 2-3 purchase orders per week and $4,500-$11,500 per
contract. About one-third of the customers for the mainframe
distribution, which has been out for about a year and a half, are
banks, Dyroff said.</p><p>IBM also introduced a special bargain price on a
&ldquo;Linux-only&rdquo; version of its flagship zSeries (better known as
S/390) mainframe.</p><p>In fact, IBM, which famously bragged about spending one
billion dollars on Linux over the last year, now says it has
recouped most of the investment. And it's hardly alone in its
bottom-line enthusiansms for the operating system.</p><p>And the story goes way beyond what we saw at LWE.</p><p>Egenera is selling Linux-based servers ranging in price from
$200,000 to more than one million dollars.</p><p>Amazon.com recently moved its services to Linux and credits
the OS with enormous savings, no doubt contributing to that
company's first profitable quarter.</p><p>Mary Anne De Young of 1mage (&ldquo;One Image&rdquo;) attributes the
company's recent successes to a tremendous growth in demand for
Linux as a UNIX product platform. One of 1mage's largest customers,
Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, is both making and saving money by
shipping its (and 1mage's) products out to thousands of car dealers
on Linux boxes.</p><p>John Gantz of International Data Corp. had enthusiastic words
about Linux in his Top Ten Predictions for the New Year.</p><p>And if none of that makes a convincing case for the long-term
commercial success of Linux, there's this from Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think you have to rate competitors that
threaten your core higher than you rate competitors where you're
trying to take from them....It puts the Linux phenomenon and the
UNIX phenomenon at the top of the list. I'd put the Linux
phenomenon really as threat No. 1.</p></blockquote></div><p>&mdash;Doc Searls

stories are the Dead Sea, slowly evaporating. Beneath the surface,
the advertisements form an unbroken continental shelf. Here and
there a ridge of PR crops through the shallow surface. Soon salt
and sand will blow across a desert.</p><p>&mdash;Wealth Bondage</p><p>Listen attentively, and above all, remember that true tales
are meant to be transmitted. To keep them to oneself is to betray
them.</p><p>&mdash;Elie Wiesel</p><p>The motivation for this counterrevolution is as old as
revolutions themselves. As Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli described
long before the Internet, &ldquo;Innovation makes enemies of all those
who prospered under the old regime, and only lukewarm support is
forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new.&rdquo; And so it
is today with us. Those who prospered under the old regime are
threatened by the Internet. Those who would prosper under the new
regime have not risen to defend it against the old; whether they
will is still a question. So far, it appears they will not.</p><p>&mdash;Lawrence Lessig</p><p>Our terrorists wear suits and have law degrees. Their
involvement in software design, at a very intimate level, will
result in orphaned software, bankruptcies and users without tools
to use. Movement stops&mdash;who knows how a creative lawyer will be
able to maneuver a broad patent to cover something truly new and
innovative. Sometimes the innovation is in cooperation.</p><p>&mdash;Dave Winer</p><p>We were born naked, wet and hungry. Then things got
worse.</p><p>&mdash;Simon Fraser</p><p>There isn't much value in free.</p><p>&mdash;Doug Miller, group product manager for competitive
strategies at Microsoft</p><p>The reason that we have not seen a real Linux virus epidemic
in the wild is simply that none of the existing Linux viruses can
thrive in the hostile environment that Linux provides. The Linux
viruses that exist today are nothing more than technical
curiosities; the reality is that there is no viable Linux
virus.</p><p>&mdash;Ray Yeargin</p><p>A time is marked not so much by ideas that are argued about
as by ideas that are taken for granted. The character of an era
hangs upon what needs no defense. Power runs with ideas that only
the crazy would draw into doubt. The &ldquo;taken for granted&rdquo; is the
test of sanity; &ldquo;what everyone knows&rdquo; is the line between us and
them.</p><p>&mdash;Lawrence Lessig</p><p>Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.</p><p>&mdash;Steven Wright</p><p>If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six
sharpening my axe.</p><p>&mdash;Abraham Lincoln</p><p>Beware of methodologies. They are a great way to bring
everyone up to a dismal, but passable, level of performance, but at
the same time, they are aggravating to more talented people who
chafe at the restrictions that are placed on them.</p><p>&mdash;Joel Spolksy</p><p>Never threaten a writer....We can immortalize you in ways you
might not find pleasant.</p><p>&mdash;Garrison Keillor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1395580.0x1887bc0"></a>Hey, Maybe There's a Patent for Badness
