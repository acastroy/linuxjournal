has been a somewhat frustrating experience. We do have support for
RealPlayer and Flash, and we have some other fine streaming-media
clients such as XMMS, but for various reasons we have been barred
from watching most QuickTime movies or any Shockwave Director
animations. Barred until now, that is; thanks to the programmers at
CodeWeavers now we can enjoy those same movies and animations using
their native Windows players running on web browsers under
Linux.</p><p>On August 27, 2001, CodeWeavers announced the availability of
their CrossOver Plugin in its 1.0 release. This software provides a
translation layer that lets you download and install native Windows
plugins as though they were being installed to a real Windows
partition, making it possible for Linux web browsers to run
multimedia content created for Apple's QuickTime 5 and Macromedia
Shockwave. The 1.0 package also supports Microsoft's WordView and
XLView browser plugins for viewing content created in Word 97 and
Excel 97, and CodeWeavers has announced their intention to support
all Windows browser plugins via CrossOver eventually.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd2580.0xcca768"></a>Getting It and Installing It</h2></div></div><p>The CrossOver Plugin is available from the CodeWeavers web
site. You can purchase and download the plugin by itself, or you
can buy the CodeWeavers Wine CD. The disk includes the plugin and
printable documentation along with CodeWeavers Wine 1.0. Note,
however, that the CrossOver Plugin is a standalone program that
requires neither Wine nor Windows.</p><p>Installation is simple and well documented, and a series of
helpful wizards will guide you through the process. After
displaying the CodeWeavers license agreement, the installer sets up
CrossOver itself (Figure 1). This part of the installation requires
little intervention from the user beyond specifying the target
directory ($HOME/crossover by default). CrossOver first installs a
fake_windows and a set of DLLs (derived from CodeWeavers' work on
the Wine Project) needed by the players and viewers. The package
does not provide the supported players and viewers: once CrossOver
has installed itself, you will see the Plugin Setup window (Figure
2) where you actually connect to the Apple, Macromedia and
Microsoft download areas to retrieve the plugins. From this point
you follow the course of downloading, installing and setting up the
plugins exactly as though you were working in Windows itself. You
simply can accept the default values throughout the installation
and configuration for each plugin. Remember, CrossOver deceives the
native Windows plugins into believing that they are installing
themselves in a real Windows environment, so the default
installation paths are the same as those expected in
Windows.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5463f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5463f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Plugin Setup Window
</p></div></div><p>When you have finished setting up the plugins you want
CrossOver to manage, restart your browser and head over to Apple's
QuickTime movie trailers site and catch the latest previews (Figure
3), or check out Director Web for some impressive Shockwave sites
(Figure 4). I spent an evening wandering through sites from a
Google search for QuickTime movies and Shockwave pages, testing the
plugin's ability to play the various file versions and formats. I'm
happy to report that the plugin had no trouble playing anything the
Web threw at it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5463f3.large.jpg"><img src="5463f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>You also can choose to set up QuickTime as your default
player and viewer for other media file types, including AVI and
MPEG movies or JPEG and GIF images. The CrossOver documentation
notes that you must disable your browser's existing file
associations and manually reconfigure them for QuickTime.</p><p>The Plugin Setup window includes tabs for configuring your
preferences in Netscape, Mozilla and Konqueror, the browsers
currently supported by CrossOver. Netscape is the default browser,
but the CrossOver package includes advice and instructions
regarding setup for the other browsers. Incidentally, you don't
have to install all your plugins at once. Running
$HOME/crossover/bin/pluginsetup will bring up the Plugin Setup
window for later addition or removal of CrossOver's supported
plugins.</p><p>The only problem I had during the installation was resolved
quickly with the help of the CodeWeavers team. My
$HOME/.netscape/plugins directory was read-only, and the CrossOver
Plugin could not install itself until I changed the directory's
permissions to read/write for normal user. With that correction the
installation proceeded smoothly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd2580.0xccb108"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>The test system included a Sound Blaster Live! Value sound
card driven by the ALSA 0.5.11 driver package and a Voodoo3 video
card managed by XFree86 4.01, all running happily under a Linux
2.4.5 kernel patched for low latency. The internet hookup was a
768kbps DSL connection, and I used Netscape 4.76 for my browser. I
was unable to compare performance with the same plugins employed in
Windows itself, but I was quite satisfied with them running in
Linux. Bear in mind that CrossOver is not an emulator; those are
real native Windows plugins that believe they are working in
Windows, so there should be little or no performance penalty
usually associated with emulation environments.</p><p>Streaming QuickTime performance was generally excellent,
though of course the reception speed depended on the transmission
rate at the sending end. Video and audio synchronize well, and
their quality is superb; my friends literally jumped back when they
heard the sound from some of the movie trailers we watched, and
they agreed that the streaming video in QuickTime was the best
they've seen in a Linux browser.</p><p>Some Shockwave pages were problematic with fonts, and it
seemed that any 3-D-enabled site failed to run. Fortunately, I can
say that most Shockwave sites ran beautifully, including some very
interesting interactive music and sound pages I found in the
listings at Director Web. The CodeWeavers team is aware of the 3-D
problem and may have a fix by the time you read this
article.</p><p>I must use Word 97 occasionally, so I installed Microsoft's
WordViewer plugin and clicked on some .doc files in my Windows Word
directory (Figure 5). My files included not only standard text but
also various notations and indicators added by the DOT template
used by my editors. As you can see, apostrophes have been replaced
by those boxes, but that was the only visual fault I found in the
display.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5463f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Viewing a Word 97 Document with WordView in Linux
</p></div></div><p>The Excel Viewer installed and set up without a problem, but
it would not view the Excel files found on some web pages (such as
the Power Reporting site listed below). Thanks to CodeWeaver John
Sturtz, I resolved the problem by adding this entry to my Netscape
preferences:</p><p>Description: MS Excel Viewer MIMEType:
application/xlsSuffixes: xlsApplication:
/home/dlphilp/crossover/bin/wine.sh &ldquo;C:/Program
Files/XLView/xlview.exe&rdquo; :switch:e &ldquo;%s&rdquo;</p><p>This entry is identical to the entry created by the Plugin
Setup, except for the MIME type. After adding the entry to my
preferences, I restarted Netscape, logged on to the Power Reporting
site again, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>, I could view the
sample spreadsheets while on-line (Figure 6).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5463f6.large.jpg"><img src="5463f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Viewing an Excel File with XLView
</p></div></div><p>The various plugins also can be run as standalone
applications. For instance, this command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$HOME/crossover/bin/wine.sh "c:/Program
Files/QuickTime/QuickTimePlayer.exe"
</pre><p>will start the QuickTime player from an xterm (Figure 7).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd2580.0xccbaa8"></a>Crossing Over</h2></div></div><p>As of January 2002, the CrossOver Plugin has evolved to
version 1.01. Notable additions and changes include support for
Microsoft's PowerPoint viewer (completing the CodeWeavers'
Microsoft viewers' collection), a simplified printing procedure
(just select the viewer's Print menu item) and support for more
browsers (including Galeon and Opera). This release also includes
bug fixes for some 24bpp display problems and improved handling of
QuickTime channels. Last but not least, a demo version of CrossOver
is also now available (see the CodeWeavers web site for
details).</p><p>Version 1.02 should be available by the time this review is
published. Thanks to CodeWeaver Fran&ccedil;ois Gouget, I learned
that we can expect the following improvements (and more): expanded
browser support (the SkipStone browser will accommodate the plugin,
and remaining problems with Opera and Konqueror should be fixed);
enhanced multi-user support; simplified installation for the iPIX,
MGI and Chime viewers; improved plugin retrieval, installation and
setup; and the usual bug fixes.</p><p>The programmers at CodeWeavers have done the Linux community
a great service with this product. The CrossOver Plugin is a
well-designed package that installs easily and performs flawlessly.
At long last I can enjoy QuickTime and Shockwave content from
Netscape, and I don't have to boot into Windows just to look at
Word or Excel files. I realize that some members of the community
will object to paying for this software, but the price is
reasonable, and the CodeWeavers truly deserve the support. They are
major contributors to the Wine Project, and your purchase of the
CrossOver Plugin helps fund that work. If you need browser support
for QuickTime or Shockwave under Linux, or if you'd like to view
your Excel and Word files without rebooting, then you need the
CrossOver Plugin. There's just nothing else quite like it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbd2580.0xccbc60"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>I would like to thank CodeWeavers Jeremy Newman, Jeremy White
and John Sturtz for their assistance and for making something like
the CrossOver Plugin in the first place. Thanks, guys!</p><p><a href="5463s1.html" target="_self">Product Information/The Good/The
