to solve a number of user needs. On laptop computers, PCMCIA
devices were designed to allow the user to swap cards while the
computer was still running. This allowed people to change network
adaptors, memory cards and even disk drives without shutting down
the machine.</p><p>The success of this led to the creation of the USB and
IEEE1394 (FireWire) buses. These designs allow for peripherals to
be attached and removed at any point. They also were created to try
to move systems away from the ISA bus to a full Plug-and-Play-type
system.</p><p>From the operating system's point of view, there are many
problems with hot plugging devices. In the past, the operating
system only had to search for the various devices connected to it
on power-up, and once seen, the device would never go away. From
the view of the device driver, it never expects to have the
hardware that it is trying to control disappear. But with
hot-pluggable devices, all of this changes.</p><p>Now the operating system has to have a mechanism that
constantly detects if a new device appears. This usually is done by
a bus-specific manager. This manager handles the scanning for new
devices and recognizes this disappearance. It must be able to
create system resources for the new device and pass control off to
a specific driver. The device driver for a hot-pluggable device has
to be able to recover gracefully when the hardware is removed and
be able to bind itself to new hardware at any moment. Not only does
the kernel need to know when devices are removed or added, but the
user also should be notified when this happens. Other kinds of
kernel events, such as the creation of network devices or the
insertion of a laptop into a docking station, also would be useful
for the user to know about.</p><p>This article describes the new framework in the Linux kernel
for supporting USB and other hot-pluggable devices. It covers how
the past implementation of PCMCIA loaded its drivers and the
problems of that system. It presents the current method of loading
USB and PCI drivers, and how this same framework can handle other
kinds of user configuration issues easily.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0710"></a>The Past</h2></div></div><p>Linux has had support for PCMCIA since 1995. In order for the
PCMCIA core to be able to load drivers when a new device was
inserted, it had a user-space program called cardmgr. The cardmgr
program would receive notification from the kernel's PCMCIA core
when a device had been inserted or removed and use that information
to load or unload the proper driver for that card. It used a
configuration file located at /etc/pcmcia/config to determine which
driver should be used for which card. This configuration file
needed to be kept up to date with which driver supported which
card, or ranges of cards, and has grown to be over 1,500 lines
long. Whenever a driver author added support for a new device, they
had to modify two different files to enable the device to work
properly.</p><p>As the USB core code became mature, the group realized that
it also needed something like the PCMCIA system to be able to load
and unload drivers dynamically when devices were inserted and
removed. The group also noted that since USB and PCMCIA both needed
this system, and that other kernel hot-plug subsystems also would
use such a system, a generic hot-plug core would be useful. David
Brownell posted an initial patch to the kernel
(<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&amp;m=96334011602320" target="_self">marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&amp;m=96334011602320</a>),
enabling it to call out to a user-space program called
/sbin/hotplug. This patch eventually was accepted, and other
subsystems were modified to take advantage of it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b08c8"></a>Let the Computer Do It Itself</h2></div></div><p>All USB and PCI devices contain an identifier that describes
either what kind of functions they support (like a USB audio or USB
mass storage device), or if they do not support a class
specification, they contain a unique vendor and product identifier.
PCMCIA devices also contain these same kind of identifiers.</p><p>These identifiers are known by the PCI and USB kernel
drivers, as they need to know which kind of devices they work
properly for. The USB and PCI kernel drivers register with the
kernel a list of the different types of devices that they support.
This list is used to determine which driver will control which
devices.</p><p>The kernel knows when and what kind of devices are inserted
or removed from the system through the device bus core code (USB,
FireWire, PCI, etc.). It can send this information to the
user.</p><p>Taking these three pieces together (devices tell the computer
what they are, drivers know what devices they support and the
kernel knows what is going on) provides us with a solution to let
the computer automatically load the proper driver whenever a new
device is inserted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0ad8"></a>/sbin/hotplug</h2></div></div><p>The kernel hot-plug core provides a method for the kernel to
notify user space that something has happened. The CONFIG_HOTPLUG
configuration item needs to be selected for this code to be
enabled. The notification happens when the kernel calls the
executable listed in the global variable hotplug_path. When the
kernel starts, hotplug_path is set to /sbin/hotplug, but the user
can modify the value at /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug to change this.
The kernel function call_usermodehelper() executes
/sbin/hotplug.</p><p>As of kernel 2.4.14, the /sbin/hotplug method is being used
by the PCI, USB, IEEE1394 and Network core subsystems. As time goes
on, more subsystems will be converted to use it. Patches are
available for the PnP-BIOS (notification when a laptop is inserted
and removed from a docking station), Hot-Plug CPU, SCSI and IDE
kernel subsystems. These are expected to be merged into the main
kernel over time.</p><p>When /sbin/hotplug is called, different environment variables
are set, depending on what action has just occurred.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0c90"></a>PCI</h2></div></div><p>PCI devices call /sbin/hotplug with the following

The action setting is &ldquo;add&rdquo; or &ldquo;remove&rdquo; depending on whether

only want it to control a small number of devices. For example, if
you have a USB mouse and wish to load and unload the kernel driver
whenever the mouse is inserted or removed, the following script,
located at /sbin/hotplug, would be sufficient:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "usb" ]; then
    if [ "$INTERFACE" = "3/1/2" ]; then
        if [ "$ACTION" = "add" ]; then
            modprobe usbmouse
        else
            rmmod usbmouse
        fi
    fi
fi
</pre><p>Or if you want to run ColdSync
(<a href="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync" target="_self">www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync</a>)
automatically when you connect your USB HandSpring Visor to the
computer, the following script located at /sbin/hotplug would work
well:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
USER=gregkh
if [ "$1" = "usb" ]; then
    if [ "$PRODUCT" = "82d/100/0" ]; then
        if [ "$ACTION" = "add" ]; then

            rmmod visor
        fi
    fi
fi
</pre>


If you want to make sure that your network devices always come up
connected to the proper Ethernet card, the following /sbin/hotplug
script, contributed by Sukadev Bhattiprolu, can do this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "network" ]; then
    if [ "$ACTION" = "register" ]; then
        nameif -r $INTERFACE -c /etc/mactab
    fi
fi
</pre>


Listing 1 shows a more complex example that can handle
automatically loading and unloading modules for three different USB
devices.
</p><p><a href="5604l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Script to Load and Unload
Modules Automatically for Three Different USB
Devices</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b1aa8"></a>Need for Automation</h2></div></div><p>The previous small example shows the limitations of being
forced to enter in all of the different device IDs manually,
product IDs and such in order to keep a /sbin/hotplug script up to
date with all of the different devices that the kernel knows about.
Instead, it would be better for the kernel itself to specify the
different types of devices that it supports in such a way that any
user-space tools could read them. Thus was born a macro called
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() that is used by all USB and PCI drivers. This
macro describes which devices each specific driver can support. At
compilation time, the build process extracts this information out
of the driver and builds a table. The table is called
modules.pcimap and modules.usbmap for all PCI and USB devices,
respectively, and exists in the directory
/lib/modules/<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel_version</em></span>/.</p><p>For example, the following code snippet from
drivers/net/eepro100.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct pci_device_id eepro100_pci_tbl[]
__devinitdata = {
    { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82557,
      PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, },
    { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82562ET,
      PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, },
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL
          _82559ER, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
},
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL
          _ID1029, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
},
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL
          _ID1030, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
},
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL
          _82801BA_7, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
},
        { 0,}
    };
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(pci, eepro100_pci_tbl);
</pre><p>causes these lines to be added to the modules.pcimap file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
eepro100 0x00008086 0x00001229 0xffffffff 0xffffffff
0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000

0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
</pre>


As the example shows, a PCI device can be specified by any of the
same parameters that are passed to the /sbin/hotplug program.
</p><p>A USB device can specify that it can accept only specific
devices such as this example from drivers/usb/mdc800.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_device_id
  mdc800_table [] = {
   { USB_DEVICE(MDC800_VENDOR_ID, MDC800_PRODUCT_ID) },
   { } /* Terminating entry */
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb, mdc800_table);
</pre><p>which causes the following line to be added to the
modules.usbmap file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mdc800 0x0003 0x055f 0xa800 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00000000
</pre>


Or it can specify that it accepts any device that matches a
specific USB class code, as in this example from
drivers/usb/printer.c:
<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_device_id usblp_ids [] = {
  { USB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_PRINTER, 1, 1) },
  { USB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_PRINTER, 1, 2) },
  { USB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_PRINTER, 1, 3) },
  { }    /* Terminating entry */
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb, usblp_ids);
</pre>


which causes the following lines to be added to the modules.usbmap
file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
printer 0x0380 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x07 0x01 0x01 0x00000000
printer 0x0380 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x07 0x01 0x02 0x00000000
printer 0x0380 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x07 0x01 0x03 0x00000000
</pre>


Again these USB examples show that the information in the
modules.usbmap file matches the information provided to
/sbin/hotplug by the kernel, enabling /sbin/hotplug to determine
which driver to load without relying on a hand-generated table, as
PCMCIA does.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x27aa1c8"></a>Preprocessor Abuse</h2></div></div><p>The macro MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE automatically creates two
variables. For the example: MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (usb, usblp_ids);
the variables __module_usb_device_size and
__module_usb_device_table are created and placed into the read-only
data section and the initialized data section of the module,
respectively. The variable __module_usb_device_size contains the
value of the size of the struct usb_id structure, and
__module_usb_device_table points to the usblp_ids structure. The
usblp_ids variable is an array of usb_id structures with a
terminating NULL structure at the end of the list.</p><p>When the depmod program is run, as part of the kernel
installation process, it goes through every module looking for the
symbol __module_usb_device_size to be present in the compiled
module. If it finds it, it copies the data pointed to by the
__module_usb_device_table symbol into a structure, extracts all of
the information and writes it out to the modules.usbmap file, which
is located in the module root directory. It does the same thing
while looking for the __module_pci_device_size in creating the
modules.pcimap file.</p><p>With the kernel module information exported to the files
modules.usbmap and modules.pcimap, our version of /sbin/hotplug can
look like Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/096/5604.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue96/5604.tgz</a>].
This example only tests for a match of the USB product ID and
vendor IDs. The Linux-Hotplug Project has created a set of scripts
that covers all of the different subsystems that can call
/sbin/hotplug. This enables drivers to be loaded automatically when
new devices are inserted into the systems. It also starts up
network services when network devices are seen. These scripts are
released under the GPL and are available at
<a href="http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net" target="_self">linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net</a>.
Almost all major Linux distributions are currently shipping this
package, so it is probably already on your machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x27aa430"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>The current /sbin/hotplug subsystem needs to be incorporated
into other kernel systems, as they develop hot-plug capability.
SCSI, IDE and other systems all have hot-plug patches available for
kernel support but need to have script support, kernel macro
support and modutils depmod support added in order to provide the
user with a consistent experience.</p><p>As the kernel boots, and discovers new devices, it tries to
spawn /sbin/hotplug, but since user space has not been initialized
yet, it cannot run. This means that any USB or PCI devices that are
needed at boot time need to be compiled into the kernel or exist in
an initrd RAM disk image as a module. Sometime during the 2.5
development process, the initrd RAM disk image will be converted to
contain an entire small user-space tree. This will allow
/sbin/hotplug to be run during the boot process and load modules
dynamically. Some links describing this disk image idea are:

image, the dietHotplug program has been written. It is an
implementation of the Linux-Hotplug bash scripts in C and does not
require modules.*map files when the program runs. The executable
size of the entire dietHotplug program is one-fifth of the size of
the original modules.*map files themselves. The small size is due
to the use of dietLibc (found at
