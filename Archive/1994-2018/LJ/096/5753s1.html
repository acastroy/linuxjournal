  <h3>Mick's Disclaimer</h3>

  <p>Not to put too fine a point to it, I'm a Postfix fan myself. I run Postfix, not sendmail, as my domain's public SMTP gateway (though I do use sendmail on my private network for local mail delivery). Therefore nothing in this article, including its very existence, should be construed to mean that I think sendmail is the best choice for your MTA needs; that's up to you to decide.</p>

  <p>At the risk of seeming equivocal, however, I also must say that I've spent a good deal of time over the past few years using and helping others to use sendmail, and I think it's a lot better than many people give it credit for. In my experience it is not the lumbering, slobbering, fragile beast some of its critics make it out to be.</p>

  <p>In fact, I've found sendmail to be stable and powerful, if a bit scary in its complexity. Furthermore, since the last CERT advisory involving a sendmail security vulnerability was in 1997 (number CA-1997-05), I'm simply not convinced that sendmail is inherently unsecurable. (Sendmail certainly hasn't been under less scrutiny in the past five years than it was beforehand.)</p>

  <p>Therefore, I think that while other MTAs (among them Postfix, qmail and Exim) have clear advantages over sendmail in performance and security, I also think that sendmail has enough redeeming qualities to warrant Paranoid Penguin coverage. (Besides, it's in the &ldquo;Royal Family&rdquo; of MTAs: I may worry about inbreeding, but I still owe it some respect.)</p>
