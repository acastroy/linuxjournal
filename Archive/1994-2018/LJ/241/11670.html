Not a programmer? No worries, Bash scripting doesn't have to be rocket
science.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x110d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm not a programmer. Anyone who has read my &ldquo;code&rdquo; through the years in my
columns would agree. That doesn't mean I don't have a constant need to depend
on scripts to help automate my job. Let's face it, system administrators don't
have enough arms on their bodies or minutes in a day to accomplish all the
various things that need to be done. Any sysadmins worth their salt know enough
about scripting to make sure they don't do the same task over and over. If you
need to do something more than once, you should be using a script. So in this
article, 
I want to give a quick primer, along with a little bit of insight regarding
Bash scripting for Linux.
</p><p>
I'm going to assume you're like me and don't have a programming background. If
you're a programmer, you're probably writing your own programs. My paltry
scripting abilities won't do you much good, and you'll probably e-mail me about
how inefficient I'm being. (Many will anyway, and that's fine, but be sure to
read the next section.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x110d5c0"></a>
What Hack-Job Scripting Isn't</h2></div></div><p>
There's a place for efficient, well planned programming. There's even a place
for well thought-out scripting (Dave Taylor, for example, will give you far
more insight on the proper way to script). If you're in the server room as a
system administrator, however, sometimes you just need to write a five-line script
to automate a task that would take you an hour on your own. If it takes you six
hours to write a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; script that is designed to save you five
hours...well, you
fail 6th-grade math.
</p><p>
Error handling is another very important aspect of any programming. Again,
however, if you're just making a script to create a JSON configuration file,
thinking too much about potential errors is just silly. Look at the config file
when you're done, and if it's wrong, fix the script. In my early years as a
system administrator, I was afraid to use a scripting language, because I
wasn't a &ldquo;programmer&rdquo;, and I figured I'd do something wrong. I was right, I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> do things wrong. I still do. But so do programmers, and there's no better
way to learn than by doing. So let's look at some of the basic things a Bash
script can do and then experiment. The worst you'll do is mess something up,
but then you get to fix it, which is often more fun than breaking it in the
first place!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x110d880"></a>
A Few Basic Things I Didn't Know, and a Few I Did</h2></div></div><p>
When I first started scripting, I did some really, really dumb things. They
worked, so I don't regret them at all, but if I'd known then what I know now, I
might have gotten a little more sleep in my 20s. Here's a very partial list of
useful things to know when using Bash scripts.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>The Backtick</b></span>
</p><p>
On the Bash command line, and therefore in Bash scripts, when you enclose a
command in backticks, Bash replaces the stuff inside the backticks with the
results. For example, say you have a text file &ldquo;file.txt&rdquo; that has a
single line of text in it, reading &ldquo;This is cool.&rdquo; On the command line, if you
type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "cat file.txt"
</pre>
</p><p>
The command line will return simply:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
But, if instead you enter:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "`cat file.txt`"
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll get the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
This is cool.
</pre>
</p><p>
What's happened is that the Bash shell takes the output of <tt  >cat
file.txt</tt> and
uses that in the echo statement, because it was encased in backticks. An
embarrassing truth is that for a long, long time that's the only way I knew to
pass information to a Bash script. If I wrote a script that needed input, I'd
save the input into a text file, and then encase <tt  >cat
thatfile.txt</tt> in
backticks. It worked, but I really wish I'd learned earlier about command-line
arguments.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Command-Line Arguments</b></span>
</p><p>
If you need user input, Bash scripts allow for this by taking input from the
command line when the script is launched. You can reference those variables
inside the script, making things much, much simpler. Here's an example snippet:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# This is my script, named coolscript
echo "My name is $1, you killed my father, prepare to $2."
</pre>
</p><p>
If you launch the script by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x coolscript (NOTE: This makes the script executable, 
it only needs to be done once)
./coolscript "Inago Montoya" "Die"
</pre>
</p><p>
The script will take your two arguments and substitute them in the script. So
the output will be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
My name is Inago Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.
</pre>
</p><p>
You can have any number of arguments, and the $1, $2, $3 pattern will follow.
If your arguments are strings, like my example, note that encasing your
arguments in quotes will allow for spaces. Without the quotes, the output of
the script would be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
My name is Inago, you killed my father, prepare to Montoya.
</pre>
</p><p>
You wouldn't get any errors, but the word &ldquo;die&rdquo; would be stored in the $3
variable and just not used in the script. Command-line arguments are something
I use all the time. It's a great way to get information into the script. If you
want an interactive experience, you can use the <tt  >read</tt> command, but I usually
just use command-line arguments because it saves time.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Redirecting Output</b></span>
</p><p>
Because system administrator scripting is often a quick hack to solve a problem,
redirecting output to a file is fairly common. There are ways to write
to a file directly inside Bash, but it's far more convenient to have the Bash file dump
its results to the screen, and once you have the script tweaked, redirect the
output to a file. The process is simple, but the ability is ridiculously useful.
The following command (which could be in a script):

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "This is cool stuff"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x110e5e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will immediately respond by displaying &ldquo;This is cool stuff&rdquo; on your screen.
Generally, you'll have a more complex script that will display many things on
the screen (like a repetitive JSON config file or something), but it still
will just print it to the screen. If you want to save the output to a file, you
either can copy it and paste it (which I did at first), or you can redirect
the output to a file. To do that, change the command to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "This is cool stuff" &gt; coolfile.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You won't get anything printed on the screen, but you also shouldn't get any
errors. The cool part is that you will now have a new file called
&ldquo;coolfile.txt&rdquo;, which contains a single line of text. I'm sure you can guess
what text that is! One disadvantage of the &gt; redirector is that it writes
over whatever file you specify. So if you repeat the command, you'll end up
with a brand-new file, named exactly the same thing, with a single line of
text. Thankfully, if you use two greater than signs (&gt;&gt;), it will append to the
end of the file as opposed to overwriting it. So if you type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "This is line one" &gt; oneliner.txt
echo "This is line two" &gt;&gt; oneliner.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The file &ldquo;oneliner.txt&rdquo; actually will contain two lines of text. Try playing
around with redirecting text. What happens if you try to use a double greater
than symbol when a file doesn't exist? Will it error out? Will it create a
file? Give it a try and see if you can figure out the way redirection works.

Conditionals: Getting Iffy with It</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most common uses for a script is to do some &ldquo;thing&rdquo; based on whether
or not some other &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is true. The construct for accomplishing such a thing
is to use an IF/THEN conditional statement. The format works like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# An example of an IF/THEN statement
if [ true ]
then
echo "The condition is true!"
echo "I love true conditions..."
else
echo "Uh oh, the condition is false"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
A quick walk-through should be clear. If whatever is inside the square brackets
evaluates as true, the portion of the script after &ldquo;then&rdquo; is executed. If it
evaluates as false, the part after the &ldquo;else&rdquo; is executed. The else portion of
the statement is optional. If the else portion isn't there, the if statement
just doesn't do anything if the conditional statement is false. It's important
to end the entire statement with &ldquo;fi&rdquo;, which tells Bash that the list of things
to do is over. The difficult part is often figuring out what to put inside the
[ ] brackets. The &ldquo;conditional statement&rdquo; can get fairly complex, but there are
a few common examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -e /tmp/filename.txt ]
</pre>
</p><p>
This translates to &ldquo;if the file /tmp/filename.txt exists, then this is
true&rdquo;,
so the if statement would execute whatever is in the then part of the script.

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -d /tmp/thing ]
</pre>
</p><p>
This translates to &ldquo;if /tmp/thing exists, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> it's a directory, then this is
true&rdquo;, so if there is a file at /tmp/thing rather than a folder, the
statement will evaluate as false. In that case, the else part of the script
will execute, or if there's no else part, the script will just move past the
fi statement doing nothing at all. There are a bunch of things that can live
in the conditional brackets. If you want to see a huge list of possibilities,
check out <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html</a>.
</p><p>
Usually, the majority of solutions can be met with creative uses of
if/then/else, especially if you nest if/then statements inside other if/then
statements. The logic can become fairly complex. There is the
<tt  >case</tt> command,
which is ideal in some scenarios. Rather than having two options (true/false,
if/then), case allows for a list of options. case statements are a little more
complex, but just as logical. If you'd like to learn more about case, check out
the in-depth guide at <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_03.html" target="_self">tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_03.html</a>.

Getting Loopy</h2></div></div><p>
Just as useful, if not more useful than a conditional statement in a Bash
script, is the loop. I find two types of loops particularly useful: the FOR
loop and the WHILE loop. Let's start with the WHILE loop, because it works
much like the if/then statement above. Here's an example of a WHILE loop, which
I'll dissect next:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# A simple WHILE loop
COUNT=0
while [  $COUNT -ne 10 ]
do
        echo "The counter is $COUNT"
        let COUNT=COUNT+1 
done
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a few new concepts here, but they're fairly straightforward. First, you
set a variable named <tt  >COUNT</tt> to zero. Then you set up the while conditional
statement. In this case, it's a comparison, comparing the value of the COUNT
variable to the number 10. The <tt  >-ne</tt> means &ldquo;not
equals&rdquo;, so in English, the
conditional statement reads, &ldquo;While the variable named COUNT doesn't equal 10,
repeat the following.&rdquo; Everything between the <tt  >do</tt>
and <tt  >done</tt> will loop over
and over until the conditional statement evaluates as false. As you can
probably guess, it's very easy to make an infinite loop with a WHILE loop.
</p><p>
Once the loop begins (with the <tt  >do</tt> statement), the script
echos &ldquo;The counter
is 0&rdquo;, then the variable <tt  >COUNT</tt> is incremented by 1, and the loop starts over
because <tt  >COUNT</tt> is still not equal to 10. Eventually,
<tt  >COUNT</tt> does equal 10, so the
loop stops and moves past the <tt  >done</tt> statement. In the script above, the last
thing to print on the screen will be &ldquo;The counter is 9&rdquo;, because after that is
printed, the <tt  >COUNT</tt> variable is incremented to 10, and the loop doesn't run
again. What would happen if you changed the incrementor to <tt  >let
COUNT=COUNT+3</tt>?
(Answer: the loop would never end and would count by 3 until you got tired
and pressed Ctrl-C to end the script.)
</p><p>
The conditional statement works just like the if conditional statement, and the
link above will give you lots of conditional tests to use inside the [ ]
brackets. Many are easy to guess, like <tt  >-eq</tt> is
&ldquo;equals&rdquo;, <tt  >-lt</tt> is &ldquo;less
than&rdquo; and so on. It's important to know that the conditional statement is
evaluated <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the loop is run, so if the statement starts as false, the
stuff between the <tt  >do</tt> and <tt  >done</tt>
never will execute.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x1507d88"></a>
The FOR Loop</h2></div></div><p>
The last construct I'm going to cover here is the FOR loop. It's the hardest
loop to wrap your brain around, but it's also one of the most useful. If it
seems too complicated or confusing, I urge you to keep playing around with it
until it makes sense. Really, FOR loops are incredibly useful. Here's a couple
simple FOR loops that do the same thing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# Simple FOR loop example
for x in 1 2 3 4 5
do
   echo "Loop number $x"
done

#!/bin/bash
# Simple FOR loop example with range
for x in {1..5}
do
   echo "Loop number $x"
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Basically, the FOR loops above will print:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Loop number 1
Loop number 2
Loop number 3
Loop number 4
Loop number 5
</pre>
</p><p>
What the loop actually does is take the &ldquo;set&rdquo; of items from the second half of
the FOR statement (so 1 2 3 4 5, or {1..5}) and runs the loop as many times as
there are items. Every time the loop runs, it assigns the particular item in
the set to the variable in the first part of the FOR statement (so the variable
$x in this case). The examples above make it fairly easy to see what is
happening, but it can become really complicated, so understanding the basics is
key. I'm finishing this article with another code snippet. See if you can figure
out what it's going to do, and I'll go over the results.
</p><p>
First, say you have three text files in a folder /tmp/folder/ by themselves:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
file1.txt: contains the text &ldquo;This is file 1&rdquo; on a single line.
</p></li><li><p>
file2.txt: contains &ldquo;This is file 2&rdquo; on a single line.
</p></li><li><p>
file3.txt: contains two lines of text, &ldquo;This is line 1&rdquo; and
&ldquo;This is line 2&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Next, create the Bash script that will deal with the files in a FOR loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# A script that manipulates files with a FOR loop
for x in `ls /tmp/folder/`
do
   echo "I am the file named: $x"
   cat /tmp/folder/$x
   echo " "
done
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns:

<pre     class="programlisting">
I am the file named: file1.txt
This is file 1

I am the file named: file2.txt
This is file 2

I am the file named: file3.txt
This is line 1
This is line 2
</pre>
</p><p>
The confusing part of this FOR loop is that it's not dealing with a series of
numbers, but rather with a set of &ldquo;things&rdquo;. At the beginning, you should have
noticed the backticks to use the output of the <tt  >ls</tt> command to create the
set. So, since there were three items in the folder, the FOR loop executed
three times.
Each time, the value of the &ldquo;item&rdquo; was assigned to $x. If you follow the logic
of the script along with the output of the results, it should make sense.

Your Mission: Play!</h2></div></div><p>
I think I'll wrap up there this month. With the information in this article, you should
be able to create some fairly complex scripts. See if you can write scripts
and have them give you the results you expect. Next month, I want to build on
these skills to give you some real-world use cases for scripting as a system
administrator.
</p><p>
I'm not a programmer. Thankfully, I'm a fairly logical person, however, and
with scripting, logic is king. There are many more complex things to do with
shell scripting, but with the basics, you can do so many amazingly useful
things. I'm excited for you to get comfortable with scripting&mdash;it can be a
lifesaver!
