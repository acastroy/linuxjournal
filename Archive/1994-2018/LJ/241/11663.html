Dice</em></span> game.

Back again so soon? Okay, we can make this work. After all, I'm busy trying
to avoid gunshots while harvesting as many brains as I can manage&mdash;in
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>game</em></span>,
don't get worried. We might work a lot here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>,
but we haven't become the undead as of yet. Then again, we do have a
predilection for nighttime activities.
</p><p>
More seriously, I've been building a computer version of the dice-rolling
game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span> in my past few articles, and I'm ready to take all the
individual components and wrap them up in a turn-based mechanism that
lets you actually play the game.
</p><p>
You'll recall that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span> (<a href="http://www.sjgames.com" target="_self">www.sjgames.com</a>) has
you rolling three dice at a time, getting either brains (good&mdash;accumulate 13
and you win), gunshots (bad&mdash;get three and you're dead) and runners
(neutral&mdash;they force you to roll that same die again next round). Dice are
unevenly divided into green, yellow and red, and each has a different ratio
of good-to-bad outcome possibilities on the die faces.
</p><p>
Here's where I am at this point:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sh ./zdice.sh
    rolled red die: runner
    rolled yellow die: brain
    rolled yellow die: gunshot
1 brains and 1 gunshots.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can see that if I stop, I'm alive and have one brain out
of the 13 I need to win. If I continue, I have one gunshot and can survive one
more, but if I get shot twice in the next round, I'm dead. The first die is
red (the toughest), and it's a runner, so that's not very good.
</p><p>
What I haven't talked about yet is the gameplay. The way <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie
Dice</em></span> works
in real life is that it's a two-or-more-player game, and you keep
rolling until you either get killed from gunshots, which summarily ends the
turn (but you retain any brains you've accumulated from previous turns),
get spooked from the gunshots you've had inflicted (in which case you add
the brains you've accumulated in this round to your cumulative total) or
hit 13 brains, in which case, you win.
</p><p>
Once your turn is over, you pass the dice to the next player. The
game continues, turn by turn, until someone gets 13 brains and wins. The trick,
of course, is to balance risk aversion (you don't want to lose the brains
you've already won) with risk taking (you can handle another gunshot, go
for it) in the desire to win before the other player does.
</p><p>
To model this turn-by-turn gameplay, you need a number of global variables to
keep track of your scores per round and in the overall game.
</p><p>
Let's start with per round. I code that as follows, starting by showing your
per-round accumulated score, then testing to see if you've died from
gunshot wounds, and if you haven't, asking if you want to risk another
round:


<pre     class="programlisting">
show_score
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
  echo "BOOM. You died. But you did get to roll \
    $totalrolls times and eat $brains brains."
  exit 0
fi

/bin/echo -n "You now have $brains brains. Stop here? (y/n) "

read answer
if [ $answer = "y" ] ; then
  echo "You survived. Now it's my turn..."
  exit 0
fi
totalrolls=$(( $totalrolls + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Most of this is straightforward, but you might be curious about the use of
<tt  >/bin/echo</tt> rather than just a plain echo statement. This is a quirk of
Bash and one that I've never really understood. The version of
<tt  >echo</tt> that's built in to the Bash shell doesn't know what the
<tt  >-n</tt> flag means, so if you want to have a prompt that leaves the cursor
on the end of the line, here's what ends up happening:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-n You now have 2 brains. Stop here? (y/n)
_
</pre>
</p><p>
Use <tt  >/bin/echo</tt> instead, however, and it works as you'd hope:

<pre     class="programlisting">
You now have 2 brains. Stop here? (y/n) _
</pre>
</p><p>
Yeah, it's a bit daft, but easily addressed with the
<tt  >/bin/</tt> prefix.
Now the code properly accumulates the score, and here's how it plays:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh ./zdice.sh
    rolled red die: gunshot
    rolled red die: brain
    rolled yellow die: gunshot
1 brains and 2 gunshots.
You now have 1 brains. Stop here? (y/n) n
    rolled green die: runner
    rolled green die: brain
    rolled green die: runner
2 brains and 2 gunshots.
You now have 2 brains. Stop here? (y/n) n
      dice 1 was a runner, rerolling the same color die again:
    rolled green die: gunshot
    rolled green die: brain
      dice 3 was a runner, rerolling the same color die again:
    rolled green die: brain
4 brains and 3 gunshots.
BOOM. You died. But you did get to roll 3 times and eat 4 brains.
</pre>
</p><p>
How did I get that to work? Here's the entire main routine, so you can see
how everything fits together (the functions I've presented in previous
columns if you want to check them out):


<pre     class="programlisting">
totalrolls=1
diceroll[1]=0;diceroll[2]=0;diceroll[3]=0
while /usr/bin/true ; do
  for rollcount in 1 2 3
  do
    if [ ${diceroll[$rollcount]} -eq 0 ] ; then
      pick_color
    else
      echo "      dice $rollcount was a runner, \
          rerolling the same color die again:"
      color=${diceroll[$rollcount]}
      diceroll[$rollcount]=0      # reset it for next roll
    fi

    roll_die $color
    echo "    rolled ${colorname[$color]} die: ${nameof[$roll]}"

    add_score

    if [ $roll -eq $RUNNER ] ; then
      diceroll[$rollcount]=$color;
    fi
  done

  # done, show score, ask if they want to proceed...

  show_score

  if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
    echo "BOOM. You died. But you did get to roll $totalrolls \
      times and eat $brains brains."
    exit 0
  fi

  /bin/echo -n "You now have $brains brains. Stop here? (y/n) "
  read answer

  if [ $answer = "y" ] ; then
    echo "You survived. Now it's my turn..."
    exit 0
  fi
  totalrolls=$(( $totalrolls + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Eagle-eyed readers will notice immediately that the last conditional says
&ldquo;Now it's my turn...&rdquo; and then immediately exits.
Yeah, that's where the computer's code will go, so you'll be
playing against the script rather than just against the chance that you'll
die before you accumulate 13 brains. In fact, the way it's written now, the
script really isn't much more than a single turn of a multi-turn game. 
However, at three columns, I think I've beaten this brain to death&mdash;or,
um, something like that. So I'll leave it as an exercise for you, dear
reader, to add the code necessary to make the computer play against you and for
each of you to have a turn, alternating until one or the other gets those 13
brains.
</p><p>
For a risk strategy, I'd take into account the difference in score between
the players (that is, if you have 11 brains and it has two, it should take more
risks trying to win than if the score is reversed) and add a dose of random
luck too. Maybe it'll be nervous and stop after getting two brains and one
gunshot. Maybe it'll proceed with two gunshots and one brain. Who
knows?
Next month, I'll jump into a new topic. I don't know what yet, so
it's a great time for you to e-mail me suggestions!
