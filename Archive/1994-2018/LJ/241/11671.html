By the time this issue goes to press, the snow in
my backyard probably will be only knee deep in the shade. It's the middle of April
now, and there's still a six-foot snow drift on my back deck. Needless to say, it's
been a long, cold winter.
</p><p>
This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is cool as well, but in a far more enjoyable way! The first time I was published in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, it was in a Cool Projects issue, and every year it means a bunch of
really nerdy ideas and awesome recipes for weekend projects. This year is no
different.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts out the issue with an article on Discourse. Web forums certainly aren't
anything new, but Discourse is a modern-looking, modern-functioning, discussion
forum. Its slick interface and elaborate underpinnings mean it can be challenging to
install, but Reuven walks through the things that make it tick and explains
why it's worth the hassle. Dave Taylor also shows that hard work pays off, as he
ends his series on the script-based version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span> he's been building the
past few months. 
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin finishes off his series as well. The Tails distribution is a
security-minded Linux system that has tons of privacy-enabling bells and whistles.
Kyle describes its advanced features, reaching above and beyond what
most folks do with it. 
</p><p>
My column is also about tools this month&mdash;basic shell scripting
tools. Dave Taylor provides advanced scripting every month, but for many of us, the
basics are still pretty cryptic. If you don't know an IF/THEN conditional statement
from a range-numerated FOR loop, this article should be useful. 
</p><p>
I'm a little angry with Bill Childers this month, because he has a great article on
hacking a Parrot A.R. Drone. I think it just about guarantees I'll purchase a drone in the near future to
hack myself. Bill explains that the readily available &ldquo;toy&rdquo; drones are
incredibly robust machines capable of far more than just scaring cats.
</p><p>
In true &ldquo;Cool Projects&rdquo; fashion, Joshua Datko combines two awesome bits
of technology into a teeny, tiny, super-powerful device. He combines the
surprisingly powerful BeagleBone Black with an ATmega328p microprocessor. The BBB
plus Arduino? It sounds like a nerdy version of, &ldquo;hey, you got peanut butter in my
chocolate&rdquo;&mdash;it's a marriage made in heaven. 
</p><p>
Rakhi R and Kannan M. Moudgalya describe the Oscad program this
month. CAD software can be ridiculously expensive if you buy
a proprietary option, and often the free and open-source options aren't quite as
robust as you'd like. With Oscad, however, you can design and test PCBs using
2-D and 3-D interfaces. The software not only helps organize
the layout of your boards, but it will simulate the actual operation of the circuits
as well! Oscad is a cool project itself, but it's also a great tool for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>creating</em></span>
even cooler projects! 
</p><p>
Finally, Doc Searls and Brian Conner prove that cool Linux projects aren't always
something that can be done over a long weekend. Brian Conner interviews Ken Starks
about his Reglue organization. Reglue recycles hardware and uses Linux
to provide usable computer systems for education. We all know that Linux is changing
the world, but that change only occurs when we have people like Ken wielding it. Doc
takes an interesting look at Linux as well, but he posits what might happen if
Microsoft were to adopt Linux. I know you're thinking it'll be a
Minnesota-cold day in ____ before Microsoft turns to Linux, but crazier things
have happened.
</p><p>
This month's focus is always one of my favorites. We also have product announcements, tech tips and more. The cool projects, however, are something that
everyone seems to enjoy. They warm my heart, and after a winter like the one we're
finally ending, a warm heart is a welcome effect.
