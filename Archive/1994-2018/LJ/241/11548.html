Looking for an open-source CAD tool for your tablet? Look no further&mdash;Oscad is the answer!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ad580.0x27a5460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Are you fascinated by electronic systems? Have you ever wondered
how they work? Do you design electronic circuits as a hobby? Have you been
discouraged by the high cost of proprietary design tools? Oscad
is the answer! Oscad is a free and open-source computer-aided design
(CAD) tool that lets you design, simulate, analyze and produce printed
circuit board layouts for your favourite electronic circuits. Oscad is created using
open-source software packages: KiCad
(<a href="http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite" target="_self">www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite</a>), Ngspice
(<a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ngspice.sourceforge.net</a>), Scilab (<a href="http://www.scilab.org" target="_self">www.scilab.org</a>) and Python. It is
useful for students, teachers, professionals and entrepreneurs who are
looking for an alternative to expensive proprietary CAD tools.
</p><p>
This article introduces Oscad and its capabilities with a lot of
illustrative examples. It also describes various resources, such as our book
on Oscad <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad: An Open Source EDA Tool for Circuit Design, Simulation,
Analysis and PCB Design</em></span> (<a href="http://www.oscad.in/resource/book/oscad.pdf" target="_self">www.oscad.in/resource/book/oscad.pdf</a>), tutorials and example
projects. Additionally, we outline initiatives to promote Oscad to the
public.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ad580.0x27a5a38"></a>
Getting Started with Oscad</h2></div></div><p>
To invoke Oscad, double-click on the Oscad icon on your
desktop. Alternately, you can type <tt  >oscad</tt> in a
terminal to launch it. This opens up the Oscad project window (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11548f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Oscad Project Window
</p></div></div><p>
Here you can open an existing Oscad project
or create a new one. Click on Project and 
then New. Choose a directory and enter a project
name. A vertical toolbar will open up. This is the Oscad Toolbar (Figure
2),
and it has the
following tools:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Schematic Editor:</b></span> lets you create circuit schematics, perform electric
rules checks and generate netlists for simulation and PCB design. EEschema
(the schematic editor in KiCad) is used as the schematic editor.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Analysis Inserter:</b></span> lets you add simulation parameters for DC, Nested
DC, AC and Transient analyses.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Netlist Converter:</b></span> converts the netlist
generated by the schematic editor
(EEschema) into Ngspice-compatible format. It also adds the analysis
parameters generated by the Analysis Inserter, plot commands, model and
subcircuit information and other control
statements to the netlist.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ngspice:</b></span> simulates the netlist produced by
the Netlist Converter and
displays the results.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Footprint Editor:</b></span> maps each component in the netlist to a corresponding
footprint module. Manual and automatic mapping is possible. CvPcb (the
footprint editor in KiCad) is used as the footprint editor.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Layout Editor:</b></span> lets you create and edit PCB layouts for the
circuit. PCBnew (the layout editor in KiCad) is used. It also lets you
choose design rules, add layers, vias and plot Gerber files.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SMCSim:</b></span> stands for Scilab-based Mini Circuit Simulator. It generates
symbolic equations for the circuit and solves them using Scilab. This
is a unique feature of Oscad. At the time of this writing, this feature is available only
for analog circuits.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Model Builder:</b></span> helps you build models for
devices, such as diodes and
transistors (BJT, MOSFET) in your circuit.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Subcircuit Builder:</b></span> lets you create
subcircuits and use them for
simulation. For example, an operational amplifier like UA741 or a timer
chip like LM555N can be defined as subcircuits. You can create your own
subcircuits and attach them to the main schematic.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Together, these tools make Oscad a complete electronic system design
suite.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11548f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ad580.0x27a6958"></a>
The Design Flow</h2></div></div><p>
Let's look at the steps involved in the design of an electronic system. For
simplicity's sake, let's consider the example of an RC circuit. The
design flow is broadly divided into three stages.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Schematic Creation</b></span>
</p><p>
Chapter 5 of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book explains schematic creation in
detail. It also is covered in the Spoken Tutorial: Schematic Creation
and Simulation Using Oscad (<a href="http://oscad.in/resources/tutorials/Oscad" target="_self">oscad.in/resources/tutorials/Oscad</a>). First, let's
create the schematic of an RC circuit. Click on the Schematic Editor
tool from the Oscad toolbar to launch it. Add the Oscad libraries to your
project using the Library option available
in the Preferences menu. These libraries
are available in the library folder in the
Oscad installation directory. Add components to your schematic using the
Place a Component option available
from the right toolbar. Place a resistor, a capacitor, a ground and a
sine source. Figure 3 shows the components placed in the Schematic
Editor. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11548f3.large.jpg"><img src="11548f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Components Placed in the Schematic Editor
</p></div></div><p>
Assign values to the components and connect them using wires as shown in
Figures
3 and 4. Annotate the schematic and check for electric rules (erc). You may
want to connect voltage or current plot components for viewing outputs
after simulation, but these are not required for PCB design. Figure 4
shows the completed circuit schematic for simulation. Note the additional
component PWR_FLAG. This is used to eliminate
erc errors. 
</p><p>
Netlists can be generated separately for simulation and
PCB design. Click on Generate Netlist
from the top toolbar and choose Spice. Uncheck the
option Prefix references &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;IC&rdquo; with
&ldquo;X&rdquo; 
and click on Netlist.
Save the netlist. It has extension .cir.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11548f4.large.jpg"><img src="11548f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Final RC Circuit for Simulation
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Simulation</b></span>
</p><p>
Chapter 6 of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book details simulation of circuits
using Oscad. This is also explained in the Spoken Tutorial: Schematic
Creation and Simulation using Oscad. The steps
are as follows. Click on the Analysis Inserter tool from the Oscad toolbar
to add simulation parameters. Choose Transient, and enter the parameters: start time = 0 seconds, step time
= 5 ms (milliseconds) and stop time = 30 ms. Click on Add Simulation
Data (Figure 5). Save and exit, and don't change the filename. Next,
click on the Netlist Converter tool from the Oscad toolbar. Enter the
parameters of the sine source: offset = 0, amplitude = 5, frequency = 50,
delay time = 0 and damping factor = 0 (Figure 6).
Press Enter to quit. Click on the Ngspice tool from the Oscad toolbar
to simulate the circuit and view the output plots. Figure 7 shows the
plots. 

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11548f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
PCB Design</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you are satisfied with the simulation results, you can start the PCB
design. You may want to replace the sine source with a connector in your
schematic. Remove the plot components. Figure 8 shows the modified
schematic for the PCB design. 
</p><p>
Next, let's generate
the netlist for the PCB design. To do this, click on Generate Netlist,
select Pcbnew, 
and click on Netlist. Note that the extension
of the netlist is .net. Save the netlist, and save and close the Schematic
Editor. Chapter 7 of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book explains PCB design using
Oscad. You also can refer to the Spoken Tutorial: Designing Printed
Circuit Board using Oscad. There are two stages in PCB design, and they are
explained below.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11548f8.large.jpg"><img src="11548f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Final Schematic for PCB Design
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
1) Footprint Mapping</em></span>
</p><p>
The first step in PCB design is to assign a footprint to each of the
components in the schematic. Footprint refers to the physical layout
(for example, through-hole, surface mount) on the printed circuit board to which
the component will be mounted. Click on the Footprint Editor tool from the
Oscad toolbar. It shows the components in your design on the left side
and the available footprints on the right side. You can assign footprints
to your components either manually or automatically. Figure 9 shows the
final component list with the footprint mapping done. 
You can view the footprints in 2-D
and 3-D. Browse and save the netlist in the project folder and close the
Footprint Editor.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11548f9.large.jpg"><img src="11548f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Footprint Mapping for the RC Circuit
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
2) Layout Design</em></span>
</p><p>
Launch the Layout Editor from the Oscad toolbar. Import your netlist using the
Read Netlist option in the menu bar. Then browse
and open the netlist. Click on Read Current Netlist. 
The component footprints will be placed in the top-left corner of the layout editor window. Place them at the center of
the editor window. Figure 10 shows the footprint modules of the RC
circuit placed at the center of the layout editor window. 
</p><p>
Arrange the components
to minimize track length. Specify design rules like Track Width, Via
Diameter and so on using the Design Rules menu. Choose the PCB layer from
the layer options on the right and start drawing tracks. To draw a track,
use x the shortcut key. Figure 11 shows the final placement of
the components, and Figure 12 shows the tracks drawn. This is a single-layer
PCB layout, with a track width of 0.8mm. Complete the layout by drawing
PCB edges.

Figure 12. All Tracks Drawn, Single-Layer PCB Layout
</p></div></div><p>
You can create multi-layered PCB layouts using the Layout Editor. You can
create your own footprint modules too. You also can get a 3-D view of the
layout you created. Figure 13 shows the 3-D view of the PCB layout created
above. 
</p><p>
Do a design rules check by clicking on the
Perform design rules check
option from the menu bar. Ensure that there are no errors, and save your
board. You can choose to generate Gerber files for your PCB. You also
can get DXF/HPGL/PostScript plots of your PCB layout. Now you are ready to
fabricate your PCB!

Advanced Features in Oscad</h2></div></div><p>
Oscad has the following advanced features: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Model Builder
</p></li><li><p>
Subcircuit Builder
</p></li><li><p>
Scilab-based simulator
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Model Builder</b></span>
</p><p>
The accuracy of the simulation depends on the accuracy of the models used. In
Oscad, the user can define and edit device models. Currently, this
feature incorporates models for diodes, BJTs, MOSFETs and so on. To
illustrate the Model Builder's features, let's look at the example
of a Bridge Rectifier circuit using diodes. Figure 14 shows the
circuit. 
</p><p>
Launch the Model Builder tool to edit
the diode model. Figure 15 shows the GUI to key in the diode's parameters.
You can enter the model parameters as given in a
datasheet of your device. Save the model. You can re-use this model in
other projects using the Export option (Chapter
8 of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book explains the Model Builder in more detail).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11548f14.large.jpg"><img src="11548f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 15. GUI to Edit the Diode Model
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Subcircuit Builder</b></span>
</p><p>
The Subcircuit Builder helps you break complex circuits into
subcircuits. These subcircuits can be re-used in other projects. This
approach makes designs scalable, hierarchical and modular. Let's look at
the
example of the Astable Multivibrator that uses a 555 timer (LM555N). Figure
16 shows the Astable Multivibrator circuit. To develop the LM555N
subcircuit, launch the Subcircuit Builder tool and create the internal
schematic for LM555N. Figure 17 shows the subcircuit of LM555N. Note
the port connections. 
</p><p>
The Oscad subcircuit library already has
subcircuits for LM555N, UA741 and so on. (See Chapter 8 of our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book for more details on the Subcircuit
Builder.)

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Scilab-Based Mini Circuit Simulator (SMCSim)</b></span>
</p><p>
Simulators use mathematical models to model the behavior of electronic
circuits. Unfortunately, no simulator gives the system of equations
it solves. This impedes understanding of how a circuit simulator
works. SMCSim provides mathematical equations that replicate the
behavior of the circuit. This feature is unique to Oscad. It gives
users more insights into their circuits and helps them appreciate the
simulation results. 
</p><p>
SMCSim works in three modes: normal, symbolic and
numerical. In normal mode, SMCSim solves the circuit equations and
gives the final simulation result. In symbolic mode, it gives symbolic
equations along with the result. In numerical mode, it gives symbolic
equations, intermediate numerical values of the components and elements
in system matrices, and the final simulation result. Figure 18 shows
the equations generated for the Bridge Rectifier circuit presented earlier.
It also shows the SMCSim simulation results. (Chapter
9 of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad</em></span> book explains more about SMCSim.)

Oscad on Aakash, the World's Lowest-Cost Tablet</h2></div></div><p>
Aakash (<a href="http://aakashlabs.org" target="_self">aakashlabs.org</a>) provides a great platform for learning
and education. It can run GNU/Linux and most GNU/Linux applications
(<a href="http://aakashlabs.org/builds/linux-on-aakash_CSI_July03.pdf" target="_self">aakashlabs.org/builds/linux-on-aakash_CSI_July03.pdf</a>). As KiCad, Ngspice, Scilab and Python run
on GNU/Linux, you easily could port Oscad also onto the Aakash. As the Aakash
tablet costs about $35, for less than $40 (including a
keyboard and a mouse), you can have access to a powerful CAD system. This
can help students who are enthusiastic about circuit design but can't
afford expensive hardware and software. 
</p><p>
Installing Oscad on Aakash
is similar to its GNU/Linux desktop version. You can follow the same
instructions for the desktop version mentioned earlier in this article. The benefit of
using Oscad on Aakash lies in its portability and performance. Although a
capacitive touchscreen is available on Aakash, you can attach an external
keyboard and mouse. Sometimes keyboard shortcuts are easier to use than
touch controls when running design and simulation tools. Figures 19 and 20
show a few photographs of Oscad running on Aakash.

Tutorials and Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
Three Spoken Tutorials that explain installing and using Oscad
are available. As Oscad uses KiCad and Ngspice, two different sets of
tutorials on each of these also are available. You can download all the
tutorials from <a href="http://www.spoken-tutorial.org" target="_self">www.spoken-tutorial.org</a>. We
recently published a book
on Oscad titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oscad: An Open Source EDA Tool for Circuit Design,
Simulation, Analysis and PCB Design</em></span>
published by Shroff Publishers and Distributors, June 2013
(<a href="http://www.shroffpublishers.com/detail.aspx?cat=0&amp;title=5687" target="_self">www.shroffpublishers.com/detail.aspx?cat=0&amp;title=5687</a>). An
e-version of this book is available free of charge at
<a href="http://www.oscad.in/resource/book/oscad.pdf" target="_self">www.oscad.in/resource/book/oscad.pdf</a> for non-commercial use.
Lots of example projects are also available at
<a href="http://www.oscad.in/downloads" target="_self">www.oscad.in/downloads</a> to help you get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ad580.0x2ab2f80"></a>
Oscad Activities</h2></div></div><p>
We have a host of activities through which we promote the use of Oscad:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SELF workshops through Spoken Tutorials: these are two-hour workshops
conducted using Spoken Tutorials and an associated instruction sheet. An
institution that wants to organize a SELF workshop should provide the
following: 1) A volunteer (who can be a faculty member or a student),
2) one computer per participant with audio output capability, and 3) one
head-phone per participant. We get very encouraging feedback from SELF
workshops conducted all over India.
</p></li><li><p>
Textbook Companion on Oscad: an Oscad Textbook Companion (OTC) provides
Oscad-based circuit schematics, simulation results and PCB design for
solved problems from standard textbooks on electronic circuits. OTCs
are available for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Microelectronic Circuits: Theory and
Applications</em></span> 5th
edition, Adel S.
Sedra, Kenneth C. Smith, Oxford University Press (2009);
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory</em></span> 10th edition,
Louis Nashelsky,
Robert L. Boylestad, Pearson (2009). You can download them free of charge from
<a href="http://www.oscad.in/textbook_run" target="_self">www.oscad.in/textbook_run</a>. OTCs for three more textbooks are
currently in progress (<a href="http://www.oscad.in/books_progress" target="_self">www.oscad.in/books_progress</a>). We invite students,
teachers and professionals to create OTCs for other standard textbooks
as well. OTC not only creates a large pool of useful projects in Oscad,
but it also helps us identify any shortcomings in Oscad. 
</p></li><li><p>
Lab Migration: this service helps laboratories that use proprietary
tools shift to Oscad. Interested institutes should contact us expressing
their intent and a statement of their lab experiments. Our team will
provide the equivalent Oscad code to help conduct the experiments. The
required coding will be done by our team and/or student/teacher volunteers
from other institutes. This code will be available free of charge from
<a href="http://www.oscad.in" target="_self">www.oscad.in</a> to everyone.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Oscad is a very powerful open-source CAD tool, and it is continually
evolving. We are constantly adding more features to Oscad. We have now integrated
breadboard simulation using Fritzing (<a href="http://fritzing.org/home" target="_self">fritzing.org/home</a>) and
circuit modeling and optimization using OpenModelica (<a href="https://openmodelica.org" target="_self">https://openmodelica.org</a>). We will be releasing these in the next version of
Oscad. We are in the process of greatly expanding the mixed signal design/simulation
