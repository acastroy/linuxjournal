Extend PostgreSQL's capabilities with PostGIS 2.0 and discover all the magic

Even if you're unfamiliar with GIS, I am pretty sure you know what Web
mapping is. GIS
stands for geographical
information systems, and it originated in the early 1970s as a set
of tools and techniques for scientists (cartographers, land planners and 
biologists). Since then, the field has been experiencing an amazing
evolution, as in many other computer-related fields. One of the
most revolutionary things is that now maps, and especially Web mapping,
are a common experience for millions of people in everyday life. Not only
in the past few years have we seen people using more and more mapping apps, there
has been an explosion in personal Web mapping. Today, a lot of blogs and
personal Web sites have maps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118d580.0x12853b0"></a>
What Is PostGIS?</h2></div></div><p>
So, what's special with spatial data? Not really very much&mdash;a lot of data has
location references (think of your address book as a trivial example),
but the spatial component is not really organized. When you want 
to organize your spatial data, you need to do it with the proper tools.
</p><p>
Spatial data, as all other data types, needs to be stored somewhere.
An
RDBMS is a great tool for storing, processing and analyzing huge amounts
of data, but you will need an RDBMS with a spatial extension if you are
going to go this route. Do you know a great open-source RDBMS? I bet you
do. Many of us commonly use MySQL in Web applications, but when it comes
to spatial data, it's not the first choice. Your friend when it comes to spatial data is
PostGIS, an amazing companion of PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
I'm sure you've heard of PostgreSQL. It's probably the most famous
open-source RDBMS, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has covered it often in the
past. If you're not familiar with it though, check out
Reuven M. Lerner's &ldquo;PostgreSQL 9.0&rdquo; in the April 2011 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10986" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10986</a>).
</p><p>
PostGIS is not a new project. It started in 2001 and reached maturity
at release 1.0 in 2006. On April 3, 2012, 2.0 was released. Version 2.0 is
a major shift, and it indeed broke backward compatibility. PostGIS
developers were forced to cause this break because of a new serialization (see
Resources). On June 22, 2012, version 2.0.1 was released, a bug-fixing release,
and this is the latest release at the time of this writing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118d580.0x1285778"></a>
Installing PostGIS</h2></div></div><p>
Whether or not you have PostgreSQL installed on your Linux box, getting
PostGIS up and running is really simple. You can download the source code
and compile it yourself, which isn't hard, but it's not really
necessary for a first look at PostGIS. If you love 
compiling, take a look at the reference material&mdash;the official
documentation is very detailed and complete. There also are lots
of blog posts from the community about custom installations.
</p><p>
When you have no specific requirements, the easy way often is the best. You
can use the package delivered by your Linux distribution (for example, type
<tt  >sudo apt-get
install postgresql-9.1-postgis</tt> for Debian distributions).
However, as with other
rapidly evolving software, you are not going to find the latest release.
</p><p>
A binary prepared by EnterpriseDB may come in handy if you want the
bleeding-edge version. Installation is really straightforward, and it also includes
Stack Builder, a utility to add tools and upgrade your installation with
future releases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118d580.0x1285988"></a>
Extending PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>
Being an extension of PostgreSQL, you may wonder what PostGIS adds to the
many functions shipped with PostgreSQL. In a nutshell, it extends
storage, retrieval and analysis capabilities of spatial objects. Let's look
at an example to better explain how it works. You know an RDBMS can
answer questions like &ldquo;How many employers are currently on holiday in each
department?&rdquo;. The standard way to ask it with PostgreSQL is by speaking SQL:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(E.SERIAL) AS #, D.NAME FROM EMPLOYERS E 
 &#8618;JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON (DEP_ID)  WHERE E.ON_HOLYDAY = 1 
 &#8618;GROUP BY D.NAME ORDER BY D.NAME
</pre>
</p><p>
What if your question has a spatial component? Suppose you want know
how many houses are within 3 kilometers from the new highway path
in your county. Standard SQL has no features to express this, but here
comes PostGIS to help perform the analysis:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM houses WHERE ST_DWithin(geom,(SELECT 
 &#8618;highway.geom FROM county, highway WHERE ST_Intersects 
 &#8618;(county.geom, highway.geom) AND county.name = 'Orange' 
 &#8618;AND highway.name = 'Interstate 5'),3000);
</pre>
</p><p>
Does it seem powerful? Indeed it is! The code fragment above should give
you some hints about what PostGIS provides&mdash;a huge set of special functions,
prefixed with <tt  >ST_</tt> for querying and processing, plus
two new data types
called geometry and geography.
</p><p>
Of course, geometry and geography are the data types for spatial
features. They are quite similar. Both let you store simple geometrical
objects in a table. The big difference is that geography accepts geodetic
coordinates (that is, expressed in degrees on a spherical reference
system), 
while geometry accepts coordinates defined over a planar reference
system. Geography was introduced in PostGIS with release 1.5.0, and
due to underlying complex math, only a few functions support it.
</p><p>
The simple features I'm talking about are points, lines and polygons. With
them, you can model the true world. Indeed, this is a standard
approach&mdash;the simple features' properties and behaviors were modeled
by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC, an organization committed to defining open standards
for GIS and data interoperability), and PostGIS, since its early versions,
was built with a strong support for that standard.
</p><p>
Adding geometry support to a table is really
simple. Suppose you are
building a table of world capitals, you would start with basic properties:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE capitals (
id SERIAL,
state_name TEXT,
capital_name TEXT,
population numeric(8,0),
PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are going to store features that can be represented on a map,
you need to add a spatial reference. Point geometry may be a good
approach; <tt  >AddGeometryColumn</tt> is the function you need:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('gisuser', 
 &#8618;'capitals','geom',4326,'POINT',2);
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, you passed values for schema, table name, geometry column name, spatial
reference system and geometry type. The last value means you want a
two-dimensional geometry (that is, a point defined on a surface). If you are going
to store elevation, you can set three as the dimension value. And there's
more.
PostGIS also supports four-dimensional geometry. Well, the fourth dimension is
not for travel trips, but it is useful to associate a measure to the geometry,
and the fourth dimension is indeed called M. For example, a stream network may
be modeled as a multilinestring value with the M coordinate values measuring
the distance from the mouth of stream. The method
<tt  >ST_LocateBetween</tt> may be
used to find all the parts of the stream that are between, for example,
10 and 12 kilometers from the mouth.
</p><p>
Before using your table, it is better to create an index on the geometry
column. The syntax is equivalent to any other index creation; the index type
is GiST (Generalized Search Tree) somewhat similar to an R-Tree index:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE INDEX capitals_geom_gist ON capitals USING gist (geom);
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's add real data to the table. How do you insert
values in the geometry column? The <tt  >ST_GeomFromText</tt> function translates numeric
values for you. So let's insert the coordinates you picked up in London
when you were watching the Olympic games:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO capitals (state_name, capital_name, population, geom) 
 &#8618;values('UK','London', 6500000, 
 &#8618;ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-0.01639, 51.53861)', 4326));
</pre>
</p><p>
The text you are passing to the function is called a Well-Known Text
(WKT) representation of spatial objects. Points are really simple to
define, but how do you express a line or a polygon? You could mimic the capitals
table definition to create a rivers table and add a record for the Thames:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0.31221 51.47033, 0.33477 51.45171, 
 &#8618;0.44437 51.45851, 0.45877 51.48934, 0.61523 51.49512)',4326)
</pre>
</p><p>
Another table could contain famous buildings represented by polygons.
You can find Westminster Abbey here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-0.12850 51.49963, -0.12856 51.49929, 
 &#8618;-0.12814 51.49927, -0.12822 51.49896, -0.12722 51.49890, 
 &#8618;-0.12714 51.49919, -0.12627 51.49933, -0.12711 51.49957, 
 &#8618;-0.12707 51.49971, -0.12751 51.49974, -0.12758 51.49956, 
 &#8618;-0.12850 51.49963),(-0.12810 51.49902, -0.12805 51.49924,
 &#8618;-0.12757 51.49921, -0.12761 51.49897, -0.12810 51.49902))',4326)
</pre>
</p><p>
The WKT for the polygon contains two coordinate lists enclosed in round
parentheses, while lines always are defined by a single list. Indeed, a
polygon may contain holes. The first list defines the external ring
of the polygon while the following lists, you can have as many as you need,
define internal rings that encircle holes.

Data Analysis</h2></div></div><p>
Knowing that your features are safely stored in a database is nice, but you may
want to use them for purposes other than later retrieval. PostGIS functions
let you interact with spatial objects and explore their relationships.
</p><p>
Functions known as constructors build geometry from definitions in
several formats. They are sort of like translators. You used it before with
<tt  >WKT</tt>, and <tt  >ST_GeomFromKML</tt> and
<tt  >ST_GeomFromGeoJSON</tt> enable translations from
other popular formats. Output functions enable the inverse translation
as in <tt  >ST_AsText</tt>, <tt  >ST_AsGeoJSON</tt>
and <tt  >ST_AsKML</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt  >ST_IsValid</tt> and
<tt  >ST_GeometryType</tt> check fundamental properties of
geometry. You can interact with geometry with
<tt  >ST_NumPoint</tt> to retrieve the
total number of vertexes and <tt  >ST_PointN</tt> to get the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>th vertex; <tt  >ST_RemovePoint</tt>
removes the vertex at the position you pass to the function. Function names
often are self-explanatory, as with <tt  >ST_Scale</tt> and
<tt  >ST_Rotate</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt  >ST_Distance</tt> measures the minimum distance between two geometry objects. As
others, this function is overloaded, the exact definition is:


<pre     class="programlisting">
float ST_Distance(geometry g1, geometry g2);
float ST_Distance(geography gg1, geography gg2);
float ST_Distance(geography gg1, geography gg2, boolean use_spheroid);
</pre>
</p><p>
The returned distance is measured along a Cartesian plane for geometry,
and along a spheroid/sphere for the geography type. If you are querying objects
relatively nearby, the question of how to use them may seem futile, but think
about measuring the distance from San Francisco to Denver:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT to_char(round(ST_Distance(
ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-122.440 37.802)',4326)::geography,
St_GeomFromText('POINT(-104.987 39.757)',4326)::geography
)),'999,999,999');
1,529,519
</pre>
</p><p>
About 1,530 km is quite a long way to go, and going straight from San
Francisco
to Denver may be a real challenge, so there's room for extra mileage. But if
you try to measure the same distance on a printed map, you may find a
rather
different result. As you learned in primary school, the Earth's shape is almost
a sphere. When a map represents a wide portion of the planet on the surface
of a plane (yes, curved monitors are yet to come), it has to distort the real
shape and distance. By passing two geography objects to
<tt  >ST_Distance</tt>, you are
asking it to perform a distance calculus over the sphere's surface. Let's
use geometry, and it will use a Cartesian plane for the calculus:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT to_char(round(ST_Distance(
ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-122.440 37.802)',4326),3857),
ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-104.987 39.757)',4326),3857)
)),'999,999,999');
</pre>
</p><p>
To get the result in meters, comparable to the previous one, you need
to add the <tt  >ST_Transform</tt> function to change on the fly the SRS to the Web
Mercator used by most Web mapping systems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
1,962,818
</pre>
</p><p>
More than 1,900km! Hey, Mr Mercator, where are you taking me?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118d580.0x127da80"></a>
Loading Data</h2></div></div><p>
You've learned how you can process spatial data in many ways inside
PostGIS, but how do you get the data into the database? If you are familiar
with PostgreSQL, you know it is shipped with psql, a command-line tool,
or you probably have been using pgAdmin III if you prefer to interact with
a GUI. Both are not specialized at dealing with spatial data, but you
can execute SQL code that performs data loading.
</p><p>
If you search on the Internet, you quickly will realize that a lot of data
is
available in shapefiles, a binary proprietary format that is the de facto
standard in spatial data exchange. Are you wondering
how you can transform the binary format in an SQL script? Don't worry;
since its early releases, PostGIS has included some tools that read shapefiles
and load them in the database.
</p><p>
shp2pgsql and pgsql2shp are command-line tools that make your data go in
and out. Not surprisingly, shp2pgsql loads the data. In fact, shapefiles are
not really loaded by shp2pgsql but are translated in a form that psql
can keep and load for you. So, you just have to pipe the output to psql:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ shp2pgsql -s 4269 -g geom -I ~/data/counties.shp 
 &#8618;public.counties | psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d 
 &#8618;postgisDB -U gisuser
</pre>
</p><p>
The basic set of parameters required are <tt  >-s</tt> to set the spatial reference
system, <tt  >-g</tt> to name the geometric column (useful when
appending data) and <tt  >-I</tt> to create a spatial index. There are quite a few
other parameters that make it a flexible tool. As usual,
<tt  >-?</tt> is your
friend if you need to execute less-trivial data loading. Apart from
creating a new table, the default option, you may append data to an existing
table, drop it and re-create or just create an empty table modeling its
structure according to the shapefile data.
<tt  >pgsql2shp</tt> lets you drop your data
in a shapefile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pgsql2shp -f ~/data/rivers -h localhost -p 5432 -u 
 &#8618;postgres postgisDB0 public.rivers
</pre>
</p><p>
The source of the data can be a table or a view, but you also can filter data
at extraction time to export only a portion of a table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pgsql2shp -f ~/data/california_counties -h localhost -p 
 &#8618;5432 -u postgres postgisDB "SELECT * FROM 
 &#8618;public.counties WHERE statefp = '06'"
</pre>
</p><p>
As declared in its name, shp2pgsql-gui is a graphical version of
shp2pgsql. Release 2.0 introduced some interesting features. Despite
the name, you now can use it both for loading shapefiles and for exporting
them, and although earlier versions processed one shapefile at a time, now you
can add as many files as you need to load and then run it once.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11323f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Raster Data</h2></div></div><p>
Storing and processing raster data in PostGIS is analogous to vector
data. Aerial imagery and satellite scenes, like those visible in Google
maps, are common examples, but other types may be way more useful inside
PostGIS. Indeed, the real value to having raster data inside PostGIS is the
possibility to perform analysis. You also can mix raster and vector data
in your analysis. The digital elevation model, a raster where an elevation
value is associated to each pixel, is commonly used to perform terrain
analysis by geologists. A raster data type has been added to support this
kind of data. You can create a table for raster storage in the same way
that you did for a vector:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE myraster(rid integer, rast raster);
</pre>
</p><p>
A raster is tiled in regular tiles, and each block is loaded as a record in
the table. For example, if you have an imagery.tif file whose size is
4096x3072 pixels, and you choose a tile size of 256x256 pixels, after
loading it, you will have a table with 192 records.
</p><p>
Loading raster data from the SQL prompt is not easy. As with vectors, a
command-line utility exists, raster2pgsql:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ raster2pgsql -s 4326 -t 256x256 -I -C 
 &#8618;/home/postgis/data/imagery.tif imagery | 
 &#8618;psql -d postgisDB -h localhost -p 5432 -U gisuser
</pre>
</p><p>
Parameters are very similar except you use <tt  >-t</tt> to set
tile sizes, and <tt  >-C</tt> 
sets the standard set of constraints on the raster.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
This article is merely a brief exploration of what PostGIS can do. 
Consider that there are about 700 specialized functions
for dealing with spatial data. I hope you found it interesting
and want to give it a try. Among experts, PostGIS always has been
considered to be a hard horse to ride. I think it requires
a little humility and a willingness to read the manual. Once you start
using it, however, you soon will find yourself asking why people are spending
big bucks for commercial spatial databases.
