Short vs. Clear</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's question to readers in his September 2012 column, my vote is for both. I find the various short forms useful and like to
discover them; however, I absolutely agree about the problem of
obfuscation. I tend to avoid shortcuts in code I will have to maintain and
use them only on the command line or in &ldquo;throw-away&rdquo; code.
</p><p>
I suggest that you focus on clever ideas for the most part and maybe
dedicate occasional columns to shortcuts.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you could finish the column with a shortened version of your
monthly script with some minimal notation to guide the advanced or the
curious in deciphering the syntax.
</p><p>
Love your column Dave, keep it up.

Another Response for Dave</h4><p>
Use new bash features even if some old servers don't understand them?
My answer is yes! My clients want the best solution for their challenges.
If they can't or don't want to upgrade an old server, they will pay the
extra time to adapt the script to the ancient version of the shell. But
they want me to be as efficient on the new servers as I (not the script
language!) can be. So I learn everyday something new and use it in my
daily work.
Please do the same!

Bash Notational Shortcuts</h4><p>
When efficiency is important, but gets in the way of clarity, I like to use
a feature found not only in bash, but in sh, csh, zsh and many other
scripting languages. If you start a line with a # character, the shell
ignores the remainder of the line, which allows you to include
human-readable explanatory material.
</p><p>
You even can precede the # with white space, so the explanatory material
aligns with the indentation level of the code!
</p><p>
i18n? No problem&mdash;the shell automatically adjusts to whatever human-readable language you use in the remainder of the line!
</p><p>
But wait&mdash;there's more! It doesn't even have to be a human language! If you
replace a clunky but clear construct with a tight, abstruse one, you 
even can include the former as explanatory material, as long as you precede it
with this almost-magical # character!
</p><p>
Given how much time we all spend debugging or enhancing other people's
code, I am continually astonished at how many shell programmers seem to be
unaware of this universal feature of scripting languages.

Linux-Based Security Camera Systems</h4><p>
I have read in the Letters section that readers say they wish to see 
different articles or more home-use practical-type
projects. May I suggest a possible article about Linux-based camera
security systems? ZoneMinder is one that comes to mind, but I'd also like
to read about what is
available in the commercial product area that supports IP cameras as well
as DVR cards with cameras attached. 
</p><p>
I have used several brands of DVR
capture cards, and most ran on a Windows-based system. I purchased a 16-port
card and experimented with ZoneMinder and then discovered a company called
Bluecherry (<a href="http://www.bluecherry.net" target="_self">www.bluecherry.net</a> or <a href="http://store.bluecherry.net" target="_self">store.bluecherry.net</a>), and I purchased
one of its hardware-compression DVR cards and use its Linux-based camera
server system. The company has a newly released 2.0 version of its server
software running on Ubuntu 12.04 Linux. 
</p><p>
Many people like the idea of being
able to put up cameras around their homes or businesses.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> might
want to do a simple article of some of the commercial and open-source DVR-security-camera-type applications available for Linux. I have
seen articles written for Asterisk and other IP phone/PBX systems
that can be used in homes or businesses, so why not one for security cameras? 
</p><p>
I
have been reading the magazine for more than seven years, and given the pros
and cons of
what others have said about the switch to the all-digital format, I am very
pleased with it and the choices of formats available.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Chad Pauli  <br><br>
</p><p>
Setting up a Linux-based camera system certainly sounds like a cool
project. I actually really like the folks at Bluecherry, and I tried my best
to purchase an entire 32-camera system from them. Sadly, the red tape at my
day job prevented it, but I did try the software, and it really was
amazing. For some strange reason, it seems that many systems are Windows-only,
or claim to be Web-enabled but then require Internet Explorer in order to
work. Hopefully, someone will read this letter and offer an article on
configuring a camera system. It certainly sounds interesting to
me!&mdash;Ed.

Comment to Jeff Shutt</h4><p>
When reading the Letters section in the September 2012 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I
saw Jeff Shutt's message about shell scripting and .csv files, and I
wondered if he'd already heard of csvdb (<a href="http://sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb" target="_self">sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb</a>). This tool allows one to
manipulate .csv files with SQL (including UPDATE and ALTER TABLE), and it could be
a good alternative to shell scripts.
</p><p>
I don't know how to contact him, but maybe you could act as gateway and
forward this info to him? Thanks in advance.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Frank Scheiner  <br><br>
</p><p>
Even better, how about we print your letter? That way Jeff won't be the
only one benefiting. Thanks!&mdash;Ed.

Kyle's Raspberry Pi Beer Fridge Suggestion</h4><p>
I received my Raspberry Pi a couple weeks ago, a month after I
ordered it, but it seems that production times are improving and
that the new boards are being manufactured in Britain.
</p><p>
I started playing with it, and I have a suggestion for Kyle's beer fridge.
My idea is to use a TI LaunchPad board (<a href="http://www.ti.com/LaunchPad" target="_self">www.ti.com/LaunchPad</a>) with an MSP430 micro-controller that has an integrated temperature sensor. TI
provides all the development tools for free, and the price is less than $5.
</p><p>
The idea is to control the temperature on the LaunchPad and use the
Raspberry Pi to
retrieve the information and display it or post it on a Web server.
</p><p>
I had only one problem. The Raspberry Pi didn't boot with the LaunchPad connected to
the USB port. I have no idea why, but the workaround is to connect them using
the SPI port (a tutorial on how to do this can be found at
<a href="http://mitchtech.net/raspberry-pi-msp430-spi" target="_self">mitchtech.net/raspberry-pi-msp430-spi</a>).
</p><p>
I really enjoy every issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, and read each of them from the BOF all the
way to the EOF (no more cover to cover).

Constructive Complaint, a Thank You and Further Ideas</h4><p>
Here in Belgium, I bought <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> at the store for years,
and now I have to cope
with Texterity. I don't really enjoy the format, but the content is there.
I restrained from protesting and gave this a lot of thought. Since
you went digital, I finally realized what was bugging me the most: it is
not the change of media, but that
it wouldn't be possible to select &ldquo;text mode by default&rdquo; in
some settings. The second issue is related to my media consumption habits.
I read <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> when I'm not at home, thus, almost exclusively on mobile Internet, which
often is very slow. Some kind of cache, allowing on-line sync and off-line
reading would be a killer feature.
</p><p>
Considering that this would not be possible with Texterity, you taught me there
has to be another way, as I will explain now.
Last week, I received a new keyboard with heaps of funky keys (Corsair
K90).
Upon connecting the keyboard to the computer and searching the Internet on
how to get it to work, I discovered that so far, no one has gotten the funky keys
to feed the penguin. I decided to dig a little deeper into the
problem. Combining tricks I learned from Kyle Rankin's hacks and Dave
Taylor's scripts,
it took me four days to get a very functional script that should already
be able to manage various types of custom inputs with minor tweaks. It is
still far from perfect, but the code is on
<a href="https://github.com/jupiter126/k90-test" target="_self">https://github.com/jupiter126/k90-test</a>.
</p><p>
Have you considered crowdsourcing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> app? Again, I
thought about it a lot, and
it seems to be the best long-term solution. (No, I don't sound like Lennart!)
The main argument is that since <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> went digital, there
is no
point in paying for copies of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> anymore, and that
most <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers have the
technical know-how required to <tt  >wget</tt> pirate versions, although they willingly
choose to pay instead, in order to support <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
Thus, piracy is not an issue, as nowadays we are not buying an app, but
rather sponsoring the writers of the content.
</p><p>
Another important argument is security, it is normal that you don't want to run
unknown code on a server, but hey, I never said I wanted to crowdsource the
server! Setting standard procedures and protocols for authentication and
issue retrieval are the key elements for successful adoption (like
passing zipped XMLs after successful authentication). From that point
on, users or groups of users will be able to code their own apps for their
own devices, and instead of having users like me complaining all
year long about the past, you will promote the *NIX way. If you don't like
the application, stop losing time complaining and start writing one you
like better.
</p><p>
On the other hand, I am sure a lot of your readers are not only willing to
code a killer app, but also have the skills to do so and prefer running code
they know rather than an obscure app.
Do I really need to convince you that the future is open source? What are
you waiting for in setting up an &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Git&rdquo;? I would love to find Dave's code
there, for example!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Nelson   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for the feedback. I like the idea of a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Git repo.
We'll have to see if it's feasible. Regarding your text-mode question, I
find that the .mobi and .epub versions are much more text-friendly. My favorite
way to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> currently is either via PDF on a big tablet or
with Amazon's Kindle, because the latter will sync my reading progress
between devices.
</p><p>
Even if there is not an official <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> repo on GitHub, I like the idea of a
crowdsourced app to interface with the existing distribution
model!&mdash;Ed.

Configuration Management Article</h4><p>
I've been one of your readers for about eight years, and since then, a lot of stuff has
changed. As a long-term Linux hacker, I've been hacking on a configuration
management system for some time.
</p><p>
As it has matured, I think it could be time to make it more public. Thus,
I was wondering whether you are interested in getting or writing an
article about cdist&mdash;the new kid on the block of configuration management
systems. cdist is kind of a revolution, because it is almost completely
dependency-free and has very well known DSL.
Let me know what you think.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Nico   <br><br>
</p><p>
By all means, submit an article query on the topic to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Configuration
management is certainly something sysadmins are pretty much forced to use
now. I'll admit I've never heard of cdist; at the very least, thank you for
bringing it to my attention!&mdash;Ed.

Readable Shell Scripting</h4><p>
I just read Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column titled &ldquo;Bash Notational
Shortcuts: Efficiency over Clarity&rdquo; in the September 2012 issue. I agree wholeheartedly. Bash code should be written for
readability, not efficiency. If the code needs to be efficient, then use a
compiled language to reduce processing time. If I use some clever Bash
construct in a script, six months (or however much time) later, I may have to
dig around to figure out what I did and how I did it. Not to mention that 
others coming after you may need to figure out what you did so they can make
requisite changes. This holds for any moderately usable programming
language that gives potentially many ways to solve a particular problem.
</p><p>
I say keep your examples easily understandable and inefficient. You may
want to pepper your examples with more efficient examples, but because your
audience potentially could be at many different levels of knowledge, keeping
the examples readable and understandable without having resort to research
in order to understand them will benefit more of us who don't script on a
daily basis.
</p><p>
Thanks, and I look forward to your column next month!

Thanks!</h4><p>
Thanks so much for offering a digital version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> in .epub
format. I already had a NOOK (original) and a NOOK Color reader, so I didn't
need any additional hardware to take advantage of your format change.
</p><p>
In 2011, I was offered an early retirement, which I took. A short time
later,
I moved overseas. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is the only magazine I have renewed my
subscription to. At this point, I have two requirements: a digital-only
subscription option and .epub as a format option. Thankfully,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
fits both of my requirements.
</p><p>
Thanks again for an affordable way to keep up with one of my favorite
publications.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gar   <br><br>
</p><p>
That's great to hear, Gar! We decided to invest the time to produce the
.epub and .mobi versions, because we wanted the switch to digital to offer
<span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> rather than less. I find the multiple formats
very nice, because I
don't always read from the same device.&mdash;Ed.

Xoom: It Really Whips the ZaReason Tablet's Arse!</h4><p>
Although I think it is a always a noble endeavor to try to produce hardware
tailored for Linux/open source, I'm not so sure about Android's future in
that it is so extremely limited and kludgey compared to any bona fide
laptop/desktop Linux distribution, but that is beyond the scope of a mere
letter to the editor. (Yes, yes, I know it is possible to run a real Linux
distribution using chroot and a VNC client on rooted Android devices. Go
ahead and try it and see how much fun you have!)
</p><p>
Err, getting back to the point, ZaReason's underpowered tablet is just not
worth the price&mdash;not when there are used Motorola Xooms on eBay for about
$200. The Xoom has a dual-core processor, a 1200x800 screen nearly big
enough for comfortable magazine PDF reading, a surprisingly good quality
camera, USB host support via a cheap $5 cable, and the latest version
Android. What with all the competition, with the price of a used original iPad
in freefall and $200 Nexus 7s, why would anybody buy this ZaReason thingy? (I
am in no way affiliated with Motorola and have no love of big corporations.
I just want a cheap tablet!)
</p><p>
Come to think of it, don't most Linux-preinstalled laptops&mdash;still rare
beasties&mdash;command a hefty premium? You often can buy a svelte used high-end
Lenovo or MacBook Pro for the price of one of those $1,200 Emperor seven-pound
Dell boat anchors. What is this, the Linux Tax?!
</p><p>
Dirty word or not, I doubt rooting is such a big deal for most
FUD-resistant, warranty-voiding, independent-minded Linux users. Rooting
the Wi-Fi-only Xoom was trivial, after a few hours of wading through Web fora.
(Wading through semi-literate forum-geek nonsense is nothing new to anyone
who has used Linux for any length of time.)
</p><p>
Like most new Android devices, the Xoom sucked at first: a microSD card
slot you couldn't use because there was no driver and a sluggish UI that I
was tempted to refer to as another sort of sandwich besides ice cream. But
now, the Xoom is nearly mature. Although the UI still looks like
crap&mdash;a
perennial problem of all Android devices (haven't the devs ever heard the
old realtor's saying &ldquo;light and bright&rdquo;?)&mdash;it is
definitely &ldquo;buttery&rdquo; smooth
ugliness with plenty of mostly free apps: Netflix, eBay, Firefox, e-book
readers and so on. If only the half-baked Android UI didn't resemble something
out of the Addams' Family School of Design....

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike "Zaphod" Grossman  <br><br>
</p><p>
I understand where you're coming from, but in the case of ZaReason, the
company's willingness to leave its product open is a philosophical
mindset I really want to support. For me, it's sort of like shopping at a
local farm market and paying more for vegetables, because I want to support
those folks. ZaReason may not be able to match the price point of bigger
companies, but it gets my hat tip for its business ideals.
</p><p>
I'll admit, as an end user more than a developer, I'd be more likely to buy
a Nexus 7, but if I were a developer, I could see the wide-open model
being very refreshing.&mdash;Ed.

Random Numbers and OpenMP</h4><p>
I was reading the May 2012 issue when I came across &ldquo;Parallel Programming
in C and Python&rdquo; by Amit Saha, which had relevance to my job supporting weather/climate
modeling on HPC systems. OpenMP is a particularly nice way to handle
threading, but you have to be careful what you use in your parallel code.
The common example of calculating pi in pi_openmp.c is a nice way of
showing parallelism, but I would have liked to have seen a comment about
using rand() in your function called in the parallel region. Creating
random numbers in threaded applications can be tricky due to the hidden
state of the generator being stored across calls. rand() is probably not
the best method to use in C due to this, possibly rand_r(unsigned int) to
store the state and be suitable for this example. There is also probably a
race condition to decide which thread gets which random number due to using
the same random state.
</p><p>
Another aspect I would have liked to have seen is repeatability of answers,
which is important in science where OpenMP can affect the order of
calculations.
</p><p>
Otherwise, I found the article to be a great way to introduce people to
threading, and I especially found the Python aspect useful to add to my
understanding. I hope to see more HPC-relevant articles in the future.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Thomas Green  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Amit Saha replies:</b></span>
Thank you for reading my article and writing in with your comments.
I am glad you found the Python bits interesting.
</p><p>
I find your comments about rand() and OpenMP enlightening, as I myself
didn't think of it before. This blog post seems to be suggesting the
same thing:
<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2009/11/05/use-of-rand-in-openmp-parallel-sections" target="_self">software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2009/11/05/use-of-rand-in-openmp-parallel-sections</a>.
And, a number of other blog posts seem to suggest that the
initialization of the generator be done separately in the individual
threads. This means that in pi_openmp.c, the random number generator
should be initialized using a random seed (such as current time) in
the part_count function.
Thanks again for writing in.

Eight-Year-Old Linux User</h4><p>
I have an eight-year-old son who is fond of computers, mainly because of games,
naturally. Last week when I got home, I saw that my Xubuntu laptop was open.
I asked my son who opened it. He replied that he did it. Once I defined a user for
him on Xubuntu, so that he could Google his homework. It seems he remembered
the user name and password, logged on, opened Chrome, and listened to music
via YouTube. For basic stuff like this, Ubuntu is simple enough for a small
kid like him.
I wanted to share this for those who think Linux is only for geeks.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kaan   <br><br>
</p><p>
You are absolutely correct. It's weird for me to watch my kids use
technology. They don't care at all what operating system they're using. In
fact, my girls tend to do homework research on their phones before cracking
open their laptops. I think I'm too old to consider my smartphone my
&ldquo;primary computing device&rdquo;, but my kids don't have a problem with that
mindset. They also grab my Dell D420 running Xubuntu and use the system
without hesitation. Kids are amazing.&mdash;Ed.
