Create applications inside the Chrome browser with standard Web technologies:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2418580.0x2510358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back when Netscape was a rising star in the high-tech world, cofounder
Marc Andreessen announced that the browser was a new form of operating
system, within which people could create applications. Rather than
writing apps for Windows, or the Macintosh, or even Linux (a laughable
idea back then), we would write them for the browser. This seemed
like a far-fetched idea at the time, but it obviously has become the
case. Today, it is the norm to speak of a &ldquo;Web application&rdquo;, meaning
something that is delivered via the browser, but whose code sits on
a server. This is what I think of when someone says &ldquo;Web
application&rdquo;, and it has been a while since I really thought seriously
about even writing a desktop application.
</p><p>
That said, there's certainly an advantage to working with desktop
applications. They work more smoothly with other applications; they
can interact with the filesystem, and they just have a more natural
look and feel. This is changing, especially given the capabilities
that HTML5 brings to the table and the ways that browsers are
becoming integrated into the overall user experience, rather than
being one of many applications running on the computer.
</p><p>
What I really like is the relative simplicity of creating a Web
application, including using the technologies that are the Web's bread
and butter&mdash;HTML, CSS and JavaScript&mdash;and which I use, at least
for client-side development, on a day-to-day basis.
</p><p>
Firefox has offered developers the chance to write extensions for a long time.
However, I must admit that I wasn't thrilled with the idea of learning
an entirely new language and paradigm (Mozilla's XUL). The
Greasemonkey extension for Firefox has long been a favorite of mine,
making it possible for me to make client-side changes and
customizations to Web sites of all sorts. But, it wasn't completely
integrated into the browser, and it required installation and
configuration beyond what most people are willing to accept.
</p><p>
Extensions in Google Chrome (or the open-source Chromium), by
contrast, use Web technologies and are built in to the browser, making it
truly possible to extend the browser in a number of
different ways by loading packages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
</p><p>
This month, I look at the different types of extensions you
can write with Chrome and consider when it's better to write an
extension than a Web application, as well as show how to develop a simple
extension of your own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2418580.0x2510778"></a>
Creating an Extension</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned previously, a Chrome extension is a combination of HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. There are different types of extensions; right now,
let's concentrate on a browser extension, which puts an icon in the
top-right corner of the browser, which produces a pop-up and also can
interact with the contents of the browser window.
</p><p>
Creating an extension is actually quite simple and can be done from
within any directory on your computer. Create a new directory, and in
it, create a file called manifest.json. As the file extension
indicates, this file (which gives Chrome information about your
extension) is written in JSON (JavaScript object notation), which is
natural and easy to pick up by anyone familiar with JavaScript. The
manifest tells Chrome how to load the extension, what permissions it
should have and what elements should be displayed within the browser
window.
</p><p>
For example, here is a simple extension manifest for the extension I'm building for
this article:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{
  "name": "ATF sample extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "description": "Description of my ATF sample extension",
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "atf.png"
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, manifest.json contains a number of name-value pairs,
as you would expect from a JSON or JavaScript object. The names are
set by the Chrome extension standard document, and although most of the
values are strings, there are cases when they will contain numbers
(for example, the <tt  >manifest_version</tt>), objects (for example,
the <tt  >browser_action</tt>) or
even arrays.
</p><p>
According to the standard document (see Resources),
the only required fields in manifest.json are
&ldquo;name&rdquo;
(containing the extension name) and &ldquo;version&rdquo; (indicating the
extension version). However, Google also says that as of Chrome 18,
&ldquo;developers should specify 2&rdquo; for the version number, and that seems
like a reasonable idea to me.
</p><p>
Because this extension is a browser action, you need to specify this
name-value pair, stating &ldquo;browser_action&rdquo; as the name and a JSON
object as its value. That value, which can (and will) contain several
additional name-value pairs, currently has just one, namely
&ldquo;default_icon&rdquo;, which indicates what icon should be displayed in
Chrome's toolbar to the right of the address bar. default_icon is a
string containing a filename, which should be a PNG graphic of the
correct size (19x19) that represents your extension.
</p><p>
Once you have created manifest.json, create (or download) a 19x19 PNG
icon, and put it inside the extension folder with the filename
atf.png. With the extension directory, manifest.json and icon,
you're now ready to load the extension into Chrome. Open your browser
to chrome://chrome/extensions/&mdash;a special URL for extension
management&mdash;and make sure the &ldquo;developer mode&rdquo; check box is set, so
that you can load extensions without Google's permission and from
your local disk. Once you have done that, a &ldquo;Load unpacked
extension&rdquo;
button should be available. Click on that, and then use the
file-selection dialog to select the extension directory. (Don't
select a file within the directory, but rather the directory itself.)
</p><p>
Once you have done this, your extension should show up in Chrome
with the extension name, description and version number. If and when
you update the extension, you can tell Chrome to reload it by clicking
the reload link under the extension name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2418580.0x2510eb0"></a>
Make the Extension Useful</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've created a basic extension, let's try to make it useful.
Extensions can do any number of things, from providing snapshots of
other sites, to interacting with the overall browser environment, to
interacting with the page currently being viewed.
</p><p>
Let's first create a pop-up. The manifest.json file already indicates what
popup_icon will be. Let's add to that an HTML file, which 
then will be displayed when you click on your extension's icon. To do this,
just set the &ldquo;default_popup&rdquo; value within manifest.json to the name of
an HTML file within the extension directory. Then, create an HTML file
with that name. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
{
    "name": "ATF sample extension",
    "version": "1.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "Description of my ATF sample extension",
    "browser_action": {
        "default_icon": "icon.png",
        "default_popup": "popup.html"
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice I also have increased the version number of the extension
to make sure I can keep track of which version was created when.
(If you're using a version-control system, such as Git, you can
keep a tag or a commit note indicating when you updated the version
number.)
</p><p>
Now that I've told Chrome that it should load popup.html whenever I
click on the extension's icon, I really should create an HTML file
named popup.html. Here's a simple one that you can include:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ATF extension&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Extension headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am an extension paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if this file looks simple to you, that's the point. Extensions
can become complex, but they don't have to be, particularly if you're
doing something simple. Save the new version of manifest.json and
popup.html inside the extension directory, reload the extension,
and click on the extension icon. You should see the text pop up,
albeit in an ugly black-and-white window.
</p><p>
If you want to add some nice styling to popup.html, you can do so with
CSS. Create a file, popup.css, and place it (of course) in the
extension directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
h1 {
   color: blue;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, add a link to that stylesheet inside popup.html:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ATF extension&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="popup.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Extension headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am an extension paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, the h1 headline is now colored blue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2418580.0x2511538"></a>
JavaScript in Extensions</h2></div></div><p>
All of this seems pretty straightforward&mdash;and it is. But if you're
thinking that you can just stick some JavaScript inside the HTML
file and have it execute, as would be the case in a normal HTML
file...well, that's where things become a bit tricky and different. For
security reasons (which I admittedly don't quite understand),
JavaScript needs to be in a separate file, referenced from the HTML
file. In such a case, the file looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ATF extension&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="popup.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="popup.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Extension headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am an extension paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
What can be in your popup.js? Anything you want, actually. Here's a
really simple (and annoying!) one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alert("You have loaded the popup!");
</pre>
</p><p>
Now clicking on the extension icon will produce a JavaScript alert.
Once you have dismissed it by clicking the OK button, you will get
your beautifully formatted HTML page, in popup.html.
</p><p>
What can you do within popup.js? Truth be told, you can do just about
anything you want&mdash;modify text, retrieve content from other sites,
calculate things and send information elsewhere. If you can do it
in JavaScript, the odds are that you can do it within the
browser. You even can use a library, such as jQuery, so long as your
copy of jQuery is referenced and loaded from within the extension
directory.
</p><p>
So, let's try something a bit bolder. Let's retrieve data from a Web
site and insert it into the pop-up window, using jQuery. In order to
do this, you'll need to modify your popup.html a bit:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ATF extension&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="popup.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="popup.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Extension headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p id="paragraph"&gt;I am an extension paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how I've added the line referencing jquery.js in the extension
directory. You also can reference one of the copies that Google or
another company has put on-line, in order to improve caching and
download speeds. I've also given an ID attribute of
&ldquo;paragraph&rdquo; to the &ldquo;p&rdquo; tag in the HTML, which will make it easier 
to grab the paragraph and do something with it.
</p><p>
The biggest difference will be in popup.js. No longer will you just
have a call to alert() in there. Instead, you'll actually use jQuery's
Ajax facilities to retrieve information from a Web site and stick it
into the pop-up window. You're going to do it in an ugly, brute-force
way here, in order to see the results more obviously, but you 
easily can imagine an example that would go through the
contents of a Web site more gracefully (or, perhaps, its RSS/Atom feed), picking out
information that is of use and then displaying it. For example, you
could create a browser extension that displays the current weather.
</p><p>
For this example, let's just have the browser go to a Web site,
retrieve its contents and stick the raw content into the pop-up's
&ldquo;p&rdquo; tag. Here's the updated popup.js:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alert("Popup -- before");

function showText(data) {
    $("#paragraph").text(data);
};

$.get('http://lerner.co.il/', showText);

alert("Popup -- after");
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the reason I put in the &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; alerts is not
because I enjoy annoying my users, but because I find it instructive
to see when things happen in the asynchronous Ajax world. (Hint:
remove the calls to &ldquo;alert&rdquo; before you unleash this amazing extension
on your users.) You define a function, showText, which adheres to
jQuery's definition of what a function should look like, namely that
it accepts (at least) one parameter, named &ldquo;data&rdquo;, which contains the
contents of the URL you tried to retrieve. That's all you're going to
do here, using the &ldquo;text&rdquo; method to stick in the HTML source. That
means the end user will see the source; if you want something a bit
more aesthetic, you can use the html() method rather than the text()
method.
</p><p>
But, showText isn't invoked directly. Rather, it's invoked as a
callback function, executing when your invocation of $.get(), a
function that executes in the background (that is, asynchronously),
returns the contents of the Web site. This could take one second or ten,
but in most cases, it'll be pretty fast. However, the callback 
almost certainly will be invoked only after your second call to alert().
That is, you'll see the first alert() call, the second alert() call
and then a change in the contents of the paragraph. Such event-based
coding is the norm in the JavaScript world, and it can take a little time
to get used to it. Notice that the second parameter is showText, the
function itself, which then is invoked after a successful Ajax call.
</p><p>
If you now reload the browser extension and click on the button,
you'll find...that nothing really happens. That is, you get the
first and second calls to alert, but the paragraph doesn't change its
contents. This is because you haven't told Chrome that it's okay to
retrieve data from lerner.co.il, or from any other URL. Because
retrieving data from an external URL is a potentially dangerous event,
exposing you to things in the outside world, you need to 
allow its use explicitly. This is done by returning to manifest.json and adding
a &ldquo;permissions&rdquo; key:


<pre     class="programlisting">
{
    "name": "ATF sample extension",
    "version": "1.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "Description of my ATF sample extension",
    "browser_action": {
        "default_icon": "icon.png",
        "default_popup": "popup.html"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "http://lerner.co.il/"
    ]
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;permissions&rdquo; key can contain a large variety of items, from URLs
(as in this case) to wild-card matches, to keywords that Google has
defined. For example, if you'll want your extension to use such HTML5
abilities as geolocation or local storage, you'll need to indicate
that here.
</p><p>
Now, all of this is nice if you want to modify popup.html, namely the
pop-up that you get with your browser extension. What if you actually want to
interact with the page itself, either reading from it or
writing to it? The answer is that you can do this by writing not a
&ldquo;browser action&rdquo;, as it is known in the Chrome world, but a &ldquo;content
script&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, a content script requires a different manifest.json, but it also
raises questions about how you can interact with a page that itself
might have some JavaScript executing. The answer is that Chrome
provides an interesting facility known as &ldquo;isolated worlds&rdquo;, in which
two separate JavaScript environments&mdash;one on the page and the other
in the browser&mdash;can operate independently, each with its own
JavaScript library (and version of jQuery, if necessary), but interact
simultaneously with the DOM and the contents of the page. Such
isolation not only means that your content script can play with the
contents of the page in a number of ways without worrying about
interfering with existing JavaScript, but also that the page cannot
&ldquo;break out&rdquo; of its sandbox, infecting or otherwise affecting the
browser itself.
</p><p>
I should note that although I haven't used them in this article's examples,
Chrome provides a wide variety of JavaScript methods and functionality
through the &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; object, which you can access via the
permissions key in manifest.json. Such methods give you access to
(for example) the current tabs and windows, really allowing you to 
control and use the browser as an application platform, rather than
just a mechanism for displaying content.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Chrome was designed to use Web technologies, and nowhere is that more
obvious than the extension mechanism, which uses a combination of
HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce new user experiences. Now, browser
extensions aren't a panacea; they break the idea that the Web is
browser-independent and that everything can be downloaded on demand
from a server. But if your entire organization will be using Chrome,
or if you're looking for something that interacts with existing pages,
or if you want to add capabilities to your browser, Chrome's
extension mechanism makes it easy to experiment and try new ideas.
