What's Up Dock?

Kyle finally has found a replacement for his beloved Nokia N900,
but maybe not for the reasons you might suspect.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1299580.0x13913b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have followed my column during the past few years, you'll know that
I am a big fan of having a portable Linux environment with me wherever
I go. For years, this took the form of small laptops (like the Fujitsu P
series) and most recently the Nokia N900, which took the form factor down
to pocket size.
</p><p>
When I got the N900, I thought technology finally had caught up to a dream
of mine: the ability to carry my computer in my pocket and, when I'm
out walking around, interface with it via the small keyboard and touchscreen.
When I get home, I can dock it, and it will expand to a
larger display with a proper keyboard and mouse and become my regular
computer. The big advantage of this idea is that I can keep my files
and environment with me wherever I go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1299580.0x13915c0"></a>
Where the N900 Fell Short</h2></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, as much as I loved the N900, it had two major shortcomings
that stopped me from realizing this dream: low-resolution composite
video output and slightly underpowered hardware.
</p><p>
Although the N900 display was 800x480 (not great but large enough for a
desktop environment), it could output only standard composite video. When
I first got the N900, I thought my presentations looked pretty good on
it. I had planned to use it for all my conference presentations going
forward, but after seeing the low-res results over composite video, I
realized that wasn't going to work. I've tried a number of different
techniques to work around this limitation&mdash;I could set up a
local USB network and then see the display over VNC. In fact, I even wrote
a previous column talking about how to do this, but although interesting,
it ultimately was not the solution I wanted.
</p><p>
The N900 was a reasonably fast device at the time it was released with a
600MHz ARM processor, 256MB RAM and 32GB of onboard storage expandable
to 64GB with an extra microSD card. Although those specs are fine for a
portable device and really worked pretty well for my usage model (mostly
terminals and Web browsing), when on a larger screen, it seemed like
the computer should perform a bit faster.
</p><p>
Basically, the N900 was almost there, but not quite. Since a number of
phones released after the N900 not only had better hardware
specs but also HDMI output, my plan was to wait for the N900+1, whatever
that product ended up being, because I assumed it likely would be faster and
have HDMI output. Unfortunately, if you've been following the Nokia
story, you know that Nokia abandoned its Linux-based phones shortly after the
N900, and the follow-on device never really lived up to expectations&mdash;the
version that had a hardware keyboard wasn't even available for purchase
and still had composite out. With the rise and fall of most of the
remaining mobile Linux environments and no real platform to go with,
I just kept using the N900 and prayed it wouldn't break before I found
a successor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1299580.0x13917d0"></a>
Kyle's Using Android?</h2></div></div><p>
I'm about as surprised as anyone that I found the N900's successor
in a Droid 4&mdash;an Android device. I'll be honest, I don't really
<span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> Android. I want a true Linux distribution in my
pocket, not a phone OS where you need a special app to do
anything. All
of the pre-installed junkware you get from your carrier reminds me of
Windows desktops. I don't like that you have to sneak around and root
the device to use it truly how you want (and to get a halfway usable
terminal). I don't like how fragmented Android is and how beholden you
are to your carrier to get OS upgrades on your device. I also don't like
that all of my favorite Linux apps can't be ported over easily. So when
I recently got a Droid 4 from my employer, my plan was just to use it for
work e-mail and calendaring and keep the N900 for all my mobile computing.
</p><p>
So, what caused me to get past all of my feelings about Android? It came
down to a laptop dock. When I first heard about the Motorola Atrix and the
fact that it had a laptop dock that essentially turned it into a Netbook
running a strange version of Linux (Figure 1), I was intrigued but not
enough to run Android and put down a few hundred dollars for a
dock. Recently though, I saw an article on-line that described how someone
had used a series of USB and HDMI adapters to connect his Raspberry
Pi to the Atrix laptop dock. Because the dock is basically just a dumb
(but high-res) display with an integrated USB keyboard and touchpad, if
you had the right adapters, you could connect just about any computer to
it. Plus, because it had a big integrated battery designed to charge the
phone over USB, it even could power the Raspberry Pi. The dock never
really took off for its intended use, so he was able to find one for
around $70 or so, and combined with a Raspberry Pi, it made a nice little
portable Linux environment.

I had some birthday money burning a hole in my pocket, so I found an
Atrix laptop dock for $65 on-line and decided to see if I couldn't get it
working with my Raspberry Pi. When the dock arrived, I hadn't yet ordered
all of the various adapters to use it with my Raspberry Pi, so I figured
in the meantime, I would try to test it with my Droid 4. Although the micro
HDMI and USB connectors were the right size and the right distance apart
to work in my Droid 4, unfortunately they were both turned 180 degrees
the wrong way. I wasn't the first person who tried to do this, however,
and I was able to find a solution on-line and turned the connectors around
in about ten minutes.
</p><p>
Once I docked the Droid 4, a special webtop mode kicked in and basically
took my regular phone desktop and expanded it to fill the new larger
screen (Figure 2). What used to be the notification area at the top of
the screen now filled the bottom of the screen like a panel, and mouse
clicks acted like touchscreen taps. Many native apps took advantage of
the larger space and resized as though I were using a tablet. What I
realized then was that if I could figure out a way to get a real Linux
environment on this device, I may be able to get close to the dream of
that dockable computer I could take with me everywhere.

Install Linux on Android</h2></div></div><p>
Although the laptop dock was interesting as it was, what I wanted was
a real Linux environment. I knew that it was possible to install a
Linux environment on Android by taking advantage of a chroot environment
combined with VNC. While a chrooted environment was not as nice as native
Linux, all I really needed to be happy was a Linux shell environment with
all of my favorite command-line tools plus a browser. It turns out that
a number of different apps make it easy to set up a Linux
chroot environment (some that even inexplicably charge money just for
the instructions), but I was able to find a free app called Complete Linux
Installer in the Android Market to make the process relatively simple.
</p><p>
The Complete Linux Installer app is from the LinuxonAndroid Project at
<a href="http://linuxonandroid.org" target="_self">linuxonandroid.org</a>, and it allows you to install a number of Linux
distributions including Ubuntu, Debian and Backtrack. The first step is
to root your phone, which can vary from phone to phone, so I won't go
into that here [see Shawn Powers' article &ldquo;Pwn Your Phone&rdquo; in
the October 2012 issue for more on that topic]. Then, launch the Complete Linux Installer app and follow
the instructions, which involve installing the Terminal Emulator app, the
BusyBox app and a VNC client. Once the required software is installed,
you then select the distribution you want to install. In my case, I
picked Ubuntu 12.04, and I could choose from a small console-only image,
a medium-size image with LXDE or a full-size image with a Unity
desktop. I went with the medium-size image, and once it downloaded, I
was able to launch it from the app.
</p><p>
Linux ends up launching inside a terminal app, and on first boot, it asks
a couple basic questions for account setup and whether to
enable VNC and SSH at boot time. After that, you can use the terminal
like a standard Ubuntu distribution and <tt  >apt-get</tt> install any software
you want. If you want to access the desktop environment, just start
your VNC client and connect to localhost (Figure 3). Although there's some
lag accessing the desktop over VNC, and you have to deal with redrawing
windows, it's still usable. For my part though, because I mostly need the
desktop for a Web browser, I use the Ubuntu chroot for my console and
use a native Android browser for Web browsing. That way, I get a console
environment the way I want it with a browser that can play multimedia content.

What's nice about this arrangement is I get functionality a lot like
a Netbook with a nice screen and an okay keyboard, but after a number of
hours when I've used up the laptop dock's battery, I still can undock my
now fully charged phone and go on my way. So far, I've tried this with a
Droid 4 and a Razr, and both were able to dock and enter webtop mode just
fine. Of course, any device with HDMI and USB (like the Raspberry Pi)
should be able to use the webtop too, as long as you can track down the
right adapters.
