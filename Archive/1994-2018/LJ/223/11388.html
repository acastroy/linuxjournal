SoftMaker Office Mobile for Android</h2></div></div><p>
Working with office documents on a mobile device always has been clunky at
best. In an effort to make handheld computers truer replacements for
desktops and laptops, software house SoftMaker has brought forth a new
innovation in the form of SoftMaker Office Mobile 2012, a full-featured
office software app suite designed for smartphones and tablets running
Android. Going beyond document viewers, SoftMaker Office Mobile includes
three separate office applications: the TextMaker word processor, the
PlanMaker spreadsheet and the SoftMaker Presentations presentation
package. Each app, says SoftMaker, is fully functional and capable of
interoperating with Microsoft Office documents with no loss of layout or
formatting including advanced items, such as charts, calculations,
transitions and animations. Advanced office functions, such as tracking
document changes and
adding annotations, spreadsheet calculations and charting, presentation
slide transitions and animations and PDF creation, also are included.
Cloud-based services include Save to Dropbox and Save to Evernote, which
expand functionality for document sharing and collaboration regardless
of location.

Denim Group's ThreadFix</h2></div></div><p>
The target audience for Denim Group's ThreadFix&mdash;an open-source
software vulnerability management tool&mdash;is mainly mid-size companies
unable to afford the half a million it typically costs for a full
testing suite. The company says that ThreadFix gives enterprise developers
the ability to review a single comprehensive security profile of their
applications. Furthermore, ThreadFix can operate at the same time that
software development is occurring and creates Web application firewall
virtual patches, which protect the applications during remediation. By
using tools the developers already know and love, the security team can
work with the development team by using the language they speak. At the
same time, the security team has a platform to manage the resolution
process that is, says the Denim Group, light-years better than the Excel
spreadsheets typically used for this effort.

GrammaTech's CodeSonar</h2></div></div><p>
GrammaTech's flagship product is CodeSonar, a static-analysis tool that
performs a whole-program, interprocedural analysis on C/C++ code. The
solution, now in version 3.8, identifies complex programming bugs that can
result in system crashes, memory corruption, concurrency errors and other
serious problems. The new version is six times faster with fewer false
positives due to a combination of new models for C/C++ libraries, making it
much easier to analyze projects with millions of lines of code. The speedup
was achieved, notes GrammaTech, by parallelizing the analysis engine to
take full advantage of multicore processors. On an eight-core machine,
analysis times are said to have been reduced by 85%. Improvements to
the analysis engine empower developers to pinpoint defects faster and with
greater precision. Improvements to the user interface make it easy for
developers to understand and analyze very large projects, including those
developed by complex software-development organizations.

Brian Evans' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical 3D Printers: The Science and Art of 3D
Printing</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Announcing new books like Brian Evans' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical 3D Printers: The Science
and Art of 3D Printing</em></span> is dangerous. Now we'll never get you out of the
basement. Should you decide to sequester yourself in pursuit of 3-D-printing
guru-dom, you will find yourself fully armed with everything you need to
know. In case you are not yet aware, a 3-D printer is a device you can
either buy or (oh so much more fun) build to make parts, toys, art and even
3-D images captured by a sensor or modeled in software. The book takes
readers beyond building the printer to calibrating it, customizing it and
creating amazing models with it, including 3-D printed text, a warship
model, a robot body, windup toys and arcade-inspired alien invaders.
Readers also will explore the different types of popular 3-D printer models
like the MakerBot, the whiteAnt RepStrap and RepRap printers. Other topics
range from finding and creating 3-D models, including using Google Sketchup,
creating a 3-D model from a 2-D image, the printer toolchain, creating
multipart models and meshes, and upgrading both the mechanical and
electronic parts.

Kord Davis and Doug Patterson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ethics of Big Data</em></span> (O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
The technology we create, peddle and service in today's Brave New World
presents once unthinkable possibilities, both for better and for worse. In
order to get the jump on the downside risks, sneak a peek at Kord Davis and
Doug Patterson's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ethics of Big Data: Balancing Risk and
Innovation</em></span>. The O'Reilly published tome provides a framework for productive
discussion and thinking about ethics and Big Data in business environments.
With the increasing size and scope of information that Big Data
technologies can provide business, maintaining an ethical practice benefits
from a common framework of understanding and vocabulary for discussing
questions about coherent and consistent practices. The approach involves
developing a set of terms and concepts, considering ethical principles
useful in meaningful business discussions, and then exploring and comparing
several overall views on data handling to help inform the development of an
ethics-based data strategy. The focus is to enhance effective
decision-making in business rather than legislate what ought to be done
with data.

Attunity CloudBeam</h2></div></div><p>
In today's distributed environments, many enterprises feel
constrained by traditional data management methods and are looking to the cloud
for solutions. One fine cloud-based option is Attunity CloudBeam, a
recently announced data-replication SaaS solution for Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3). Attunity says that the service provides
replication and synchronization of Big Data stored in S3 across AWS cloud
regions to enable business-critical initiatives, including disaster
recovery, backup and data distribution. The new Attunity CloudBeam service
is designed to ensure that information availability in the cloud is quick,
reliable, easy-to-use and affordable for AWS customers. The service
provider cites the fact that organizations can configure cloud
systems properly to be ready to go when needed but never pay for any services until
they're actually used. Other key features include parallelized and
elastic data transfer to maximize use of bandwidth, configurable scheduling
to ensure predictable information availability, optimized data transfer for
moving large objects and large numbers of objects, delta replication using
comparative snapshot technology, fast set up with
&ldquo;Click-2-Replicate&rdquo; configuration, and no server or appliance setup
required.

Codethink's Baserock Embedded Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The role of Codethink's Baserock Embedded Linux is to enable silicon
chipset and board vendors&mdash;not to mention Original Device
Manufacturers and Systems Integrators&mdash;to keep pace with the rapid
development of Linux and dramatically reduce product development cycles.
Baserock, just elevated to v1.1, is an open-source Linux build system for
the development of embedded, industrial or bare-metal server-based Linux
systems. This new release provides virtual machine images for developers
and a sample base image to demonstrate a Baserock-produced small system
image. The OS also delivers the proven benefits of continuous integration
(CI) to Linux system development, which heretofore were available only to
developers of server and Web-based applications, says Codethink. CI, adds
Codethink, makes it easier to develop Linux-based systems and to integrate
system components. Baserock source code is available for building on 64-bit
x86 and ARM systems. Virtual machine binaries are available for 64-bit x86
machines. Through native compilation of software and images, Codethink
asserts that Baserock provides a robust and highly efficient build
environment that is as closely aligned to upstream development
environments as possible.
