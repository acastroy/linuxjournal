<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #223, November 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This edition of diff -u is dedicated to <span   class="bold"><b>Andre
Hedrick</b></span>, who committed
suicide in July 2012. He was best known for his work on the <span   class="bold"><b>IDE driver</b></span> and
later the <span   class="bold"><b>ATA subsystem</b></span>, which provided essentially the same features.
</p><p>
I knew Andre only from his e-mails to the kernel mailing list. He
seemed supremely confident in his understanding of the intricacies of
IDE hard drive technology. He had a deep understanding of the
specifications and standards, but he also had a deep understanding of
the way the different pieces of hardware violated those specs and
standards. Sometimes his understanding derived from conversations with
the manufacturers and engineers who developed the hardware. IDE/ATA
was one of the biggest nightmares of the entire kernel, for years. It
was one of those areas that just <span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> to work right, but that was
steeped in mystery and confusion. Even detecting which hard drive was
on the system was a nightmarish puzzle in many cases.
</p><p>
Andre really could lose his temper though when someone disagreed with
him. Once upon a time in 2000, he discovered that the root user could
physically damage the hard drive on a given system. To him, this was
an important bug, because if malicious users gained root, he felt
they shouldn't be able to do real physical harm. But when he submitted
his patch to fix the problem, no one wanted to take it, on the grounds
that if someone gains root privileges, it's already game-over. During
the ensuing flame war, Andre famously said in multiple different
e-mail messages, &ldquo;Here is your SECURITY HOLE! JOE-SIX-PACK-HACKER can fry your
butt.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He may have been hard to deal with sometimes, but I believe his heart
always was in the right place. The cantankerous rantings that seemed
so abusive at times, all stemmed from a desire to help and protect
users, in the face of a truly ugly yet absolutely essential hardware
industry.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kernel configuration system</b></span> is about to become much simpler for
the great mass of users in the world. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> recently put out
a call to action, of sorts. He'd noticed that Linux distributions
often had odd and unpredictable kernel configurations, and the system
might break in subtle ways if users compiled a kernel that lacked some
obscure option or other. This typically was not a problem for kernel
developers themselves who tend to have a deep understanding of
configuration options, but for regular users, he felt it resulted in
fewer people being comfortable compiling their own kernels. Linus asked
the kernel developers in general to work on providing a minimal
default kernel configuration for all versions of all main
distributions. This would ensure a working kernel and give users a
jumping-off point for their own explorations.
</p><p>
Kernel development often is pretty crazy, and kernel developers like
their little jokes. Recently when <span   class="bold"><b>Alexandre Pereira da
Silva</b></span> suggested
adding a &ldquo;Tested-by:&rdquo; signature to all of the kernel's <span   class="bold"><b>git commits</b></span>, it
led to a discussion of all the different types of git signatures that
have been accepted into the kernel. Some of the choicest were things
like &ldquo;Fatfingered-by:&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heckled-for-on-IRC-by:&rdquo;. These are
actually in the kernel, or at least in the git log. On one level, it's
a shame, because people doing data mining to analyze kernel
development may have a harder time with their analysis, but on another
level, it's all pretty funny.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Never Plug In Your Phone Again!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #223, November 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Last month (the October 2012 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>), I showed you an awesome audiobook player app for Android, but
I didn't share my frustration in getting the audio files on to my phone. When
I plugged my phone in to the computer, I couldn't get the SD card to mount,
no matter what settings I changed. It was very frustrating and forced
me to come up with a better way. Enter: FolderSync.

</p><p>
First off, it's important to note that FolderSync isn't free. There is a
free version, but it's limited to a single account and has ads, and although
it works, it really isn't the same as the full app. If you're like me,
you don't think twice about spending $5 on a fancy cup of coffee, but if you
have to pay for an app on your phone, you debate internally for hours. I've
never been so happy I spent $2.29 on an app.
</p><p>
Basically, FolderSync works on your phone sort of like Dropbox works
on your desktop computer. Instead of syncing only your Dropbox files,
however, FolderSync supports a wide variety of data sources. At the time of this
writing, data can be synchronized with Amazon S3, Google Docs, Google
Drive, SkyDrive, Dropbox, SugarSync, Box.net, Ubuntu One, NetDocuments,
FTP/FTPES/FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV/WebDAVs and Samba/SMB/CIFS.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11375androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Image from the FolderSync Home Page: <a href="http://www.tacit.dk" target="_self">www.tacit.dk</a>
</p></div></div><p>
In my case, I keep an Audiobooks folder on a share at home, and every
night the files are synced up. With the paid version, synchronizations
can be forced as well. Although the Audiobook syncing is the only thing I use
FolderSync for, it's the perfect tool to keep music, photos, documents or
anything else synchronized on your phone without ever plugging it in to the
computer. Because FolderSync supports two-way synchronization, it is possible
to delete files from your home server, so be careful!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11375androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Image from the FolderSync Home Page: <a href="http://www.tacit.dk" target="_self">www.tacit.dk</a>
</p></div></div><p>
After configuring FolderSync to sync my Audiobooks automatically,
but only over Wi-Fi and only while plugged in, I realized it
had to be Editors' Choice for this month. That means two Android
apps in a row win the coveted title, but once you try it, I
suspect you'll agree. Check out FolderSync at the Google Play Store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full</a>,
or if you'd prefer to keep your pumpkin latte
money, try out the Lite version:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #223, November 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Usually the Non-Linux FOSS article is dedicated to open-source software
for Windows or OS X, but since this month's The Open-Source Classroom column
is about surviving in a Windows world as a Linux user, I thought I'd
take some liberties here and talk about open-source soda!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11375fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you've been to Penguicon (<a href="http://www.penguicon.org" target="_self">www.penguicon.org</a>), it's likely you've been
able to taste OpenCola, the fully open-source soda-pop drink designed
to take the mystery out of cola. The original formula is available all
over the Internet (because it's open source!), but there are some great
step-by-step procedures as well. Wiki-How has a great outline here:
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-OpenCola" target="_self">www.wikihow.com/Make-OpenCola</a>.
</p><p>
For a more complex recipe and at least one other flavor, be sure to visit
<a href="http://www.opensoda.org" target="_self">www.opensoda.org</a> as well. Sharing recipes is nothing new for homebrewers
of beer, but it's surprisingly difficult to find soda-pop recipes. Perhaps
with the supermarket availability of SodaStream (<a href="http://www.sodastream.com" target="_self">www.sodastream.com</a>), open-source recipes will become more common. In the meantime, if you'd like to
try open-source soda, be sure to stop by Penguicon's Consuite next year.

I have a huge collection of NASA photos taken from the Astronomy Pic of
the Day Web site (<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html" target="_self">apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html</a>) stored in a
folder in my Dropbox. No matter what computer system I'm using, I rotate
those images on my background, getting a virtual tour of the universe
on every screen. Oddly enough, it can be challenging to get that image
rotation to work well in Linux. I've mentioned some wallpaper-rotating
applications before, but Slidewall is really pretty cool.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11375slidef1.large.jpg"><img src="11375slidef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Slidewall includes a small d&aelig;mon process to change GNOME-based desktop
wallpaper images. It's in the Ubuntu 12.04+ repositories, but it will work
with any GNOME-based system. Rotating a wallpaper collection works well,
but Slidewall goes the extra mile and will fetch collections live from
the Internet, or it can display a live picture of the Earth showing which
parts have sunlight and which don't. Slidewall is a huge step forward in
desktop wallpaper management, and if you have a difficult time deciding
what picture to use as your background, now you don't have to choose
just one!

Although many thought <span   class="emphasis"><em>Duke Nukem Forever</em></span> was nothing more than vaporware
meant to be used as a metaphor for &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo;, we were
all shocked when it was actually released. Linux users have a similar
love/hate relationship with with Valve, the makers of the Steam platform
for gaming. Rumors of Linux-native Steam have been circulating for years,
but nothing apart from running Steam under Wine ever has brought the
popular platform to Linux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11375steamf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Several months ago, Valve announced it was working on a client,
and I excitedly wrote about it, only to look foolish when months
went by and nothing happened. Based on communication from Valve,
it looks like in October 2012 there will be 1,000 real-life Linux users
chosen for an external beta release! Will those chosen few be sworn to
secrecy? Is Valve messing with journalists and not even have
a Linux plan? For news right from the horse's mouth, check out Valve's

<h2 class="title">Symbolic Math with Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #223, November 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many programming languages include libraries to do more complicated
math. You can do statistics, numerical analysis or handle big
numbers. One topic many programming languages have difficulty with is
symbolic math. If you use Python though, you have access to sympy, the symbolic
math library. Sympy is under constant development, and it's aiming to be a
full-featured computer algebra system (CAS). It also is written completely
in Python, so you won't need to install any extra requirements. You
can download a source tarball or a git repository if you want 
the latest and greatest. Most distributions also provide a package for
sympy for those of you less concerned about being bleeding-edge. Once it
is installed, you will be able to access the sympy library in two ways. You
can access it like any other library with the import statement. But, sympy
also provides a binary called isympy that is modeled after ipython.
</p><p>
In its simplest mode, sympy can be used as a calculator. Sympy
has built-in support for three numeric types: float, rational and
integer. Float and integer are intuitive, but what is a rational? A
rational number is made of a numerator and a denominator. So,
Rational(5,2) is equivalent to 5/2. There is also support for complex
numbers. The imaginary part of a complex number is tagged with the
constant I. So, a basic complex number is:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
a + b*I
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get the imaginary part with &ldquo;im&rdquo;, and the real part with
&ldquo;re&rdquo;. You
need to tell functions explicitly when they need to deal with complex
numbers. For example, when doing a basic expansion, you get:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
exp(I*x).expand() exp(I*x)
</pre>
</p><p>
To get the actual expansion, you need to tell <tt  >expand</tt> that it is dealing
with complex numbers. This would look like:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
exp(I*x).expand(complex=True)
</pre>
</p><p>
All of the standard arithmetic operators, like addition, multiplication
and power are available. All of the usual functions also are available,
like trigonometric functions, special functions and so on. Special
constants, like e and pi, are treated symbolically in sympy. They
won't actually evaluate to a number, so something like &ldquo;1+pi&rdquo; remains
&ldquo;1+pi&rdquo;. You actually have to use evalf explicitly to get a numeric
value. There is also a class, called <tt  >oo</tt>, which represents the concept
of infinity&mdash;a handy extra when doing more complicated mathematics.
</p><p>
Although this is useful, the real power of a CAS is the ability to do symbolic
mathematics, like calculus or solving equations. Most other CASes
automatically create symbolic variables when you use them. In sympy, these
symbolic entities exist as classes, so you need to create
them explicitly. You create them by using:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x = Symbol('x')
y = Symbol('y')
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have more than one symbol at a time to define, you can use:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x,y = symbols('x', 'y')
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can use them in other operations, like looking at equations. For
example:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
(x+y)**2
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can apply operations to these equations, like expanding it:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
((x+y)**2).expand()
x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can substitute these variables for other variables, or even
numbers, using the substitution operator. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
((x+y)**2).subs(x,1)
(1+y)**2
</pre>
</p><p>
You can decompose or combine more complicated equations too. For example,
let's say you have the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(x+1)/(x-1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can do a partial fraction decomposition with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apart((x+1)/(x-1),x)
1 + 2/(x-1)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can combine things back together again with:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
together(1 + 2/(x-1))
(x+1)/(x-1)
</pre>
</p><p>
When dealing with trigonometric functions, you need to tell operators like
<tt  >expand</tt> and <tt  >together</tt> about it. For example, you could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sin(x+y).expand(trig=True)
sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x)
</pre>
</p><p>
The really big use case for a CAS is calculus. Calculus is the backbone of
scientific calculations and is used in many situations. One of the
fundamental ideas in calculus is the limit. Sympy provides a function
called <tt  >limit</tt> to handle exactly that. You need to provide a function, a
variable and the value toward which the limit is being calculated. So, if
you wanted to calculate the limit of (sin(x)/x) as x goes to 0, you would
use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)
1
</pre>
</p><p>
Because sympy provides an infinity object, you can calculate limits as they
go to infinity. So, you can calculate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
limit(1/x, x, oo)
0
</pre>
</p><p>
Sympy also allows you to do differentiation. It can understand basic
polynomials, as well as trigonometric functions. If you wanted to
differentiate sin(x), then you could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
x = Symbol('x')
diff(sin(x), x)

cos(x)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can calculate higher derivatives by adding an extra parameter to the
<tt  >diff</tt> function call. So, calculating the first derivative of (x**2) can be
done with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
diff(x**2, x, 1)
2*x
</pre>
</p><p>
While the second derivative can be done with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
diff(x**2, x, 2)
2
</pre>
</p><p>
Sympy provides for calculating solutions to differential equations. You can
define a differential equation with the <tt  >diff</tt> function. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
f(x).diff(x,x) + f(x)
</pre>
</p><p>
where <tt  >f(x)</tt> is the function of interest, and
<tt  >diff(x,x)</tt> takes the second
derivative of f(x) with respect to x. To solve this equation, you would use
the function <tt  >dsolve</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dsolve(f(x).diff(x,x) + f(x), f(x))
f(x) = C1*cos(x) + C2*sin(x)
</pre>
</p><p>
This is a very common task in scientific calculations.
</p><p>
The opposite of differentiation is integration. Sympy provides support for
both indefinite and definite integrals. You can integrate elementary
functions with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
integrate(sin(x), x)
-cos(x)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can integrate special functions too. For example:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
integrate(exp(-x**2)*erf(x), x)
</pre>
</p><p>
Definite integrals can be calculated by adding limits to the integration.
If you integrate sin(x) from 0 to pi/2, you would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
integrate(sin(x), (x, 0, pi/2))
1
</pre>
</p><p>
Sympy also can handle some improper integrals. For example:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
integrate(exp(x), (x, 0, oo))
1
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes, equations are too complex to deal with analytically. In those
cases, you need to generate a series expansion and calculate an
approximation. Sympy provides the operator <tt  >series</tt> to do this. For
example, if you wanted a fourth-order series expansion of cos(x) about 0,
you would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cos(x).series(x, 0, 4)
1 - (x**2)/2 + (x**4)/24
</pre>
</p><p>
Sympy handles linear algebra through the use of the
<tt  >Matrix</tt>class. If you
are dealing with just numbers, you can use:

   
<pre     class="programlisting">
Matrix([[1,0], [0,1]])
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to, you can define the dimensions of your matrix explicitly.
This would look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Matrix(2, 2, [1, 0, 0, 1])
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use symbolic variables in your matrices:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x = Symbol('x')
y = Symbol('y')
A = Matrix([[1,x], [y,1]])
</pre>
</p><p>
Once a matrix is created, you can operate on it. There are functions to do
dot products, cross products or calculate determinants. Vectors are simply
matrices made of either one row or one column.
</p><p>
Doing all of these calculations is a bit of a waste if you can't print out
what you are doing in a form you can use. The most basic output is
generated with the <tt  >print</tt> command. If you want to dress it up some, you can
use the <tt  >pprint</tt> command. This command does some ASCII pretty-printing, using
ASCII characters to display things like integral signs. If you want to
generate output that you can use in a published article, you can make sympy
generate LaTeX output. This is done with the <tt  >latex</tt>
function. Simply using
the plain function will generate generic LaTeX output. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
latex(x**2)
x^{2}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can hand in modes, however, for special cases. If you wanted to
generate inline LaTeX, you could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
latex(x**2, mode='inline')
$x^{2}$
</pre>
</p><p>
You can generate full LaTeX equation output with:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
latex(x**2, mode='equation')
\begin{equation}x^{2}\end{equation}
</pre>
</p><p>
To end, let's look at some gotchas that may crop up. The first thing to
consider is the equal sign. A single equal sign is the assignment operator,
while two equal signs are used for equality testing. Equality testing
applies only to actual equality, not symbolic. So, testing the following will return
false:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(x+1)**2 == x**2 + 2*x + 1
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to test whether two equations are equal, you
need to subtract one from the other, and through careful use of 
<tt  >expand</tt>, <tt  >simplify</tt> and
<tt  >trigsimp</tt>, see whether you end up with 0. Sympy
doesn't use the default Python int and float, because it provides more
control. If you have an expression that contains only numbers, the
default Python types are used. If you want to use the sympy data types, you
can use the function <tt  >sympify()</tt>, or
<tt  >S()</tt>. So, using Python data types, you
get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
6.2 -&gt; 6.2000000000000002
</pre>
</p><p>
Whereas the sympy data types give:

<pre     class="programlisting">
S(6.2) -&gt; 6.20000000000000
</pre>
</p><p>
Expressions are immutable in sympy. Any functions applied to them do not
change the expressions themselves, but instead return new expressions.
</p><p>
This article touched on only the most basic elements of sympy. But, I hope
you have seen that it can be very useful in doing scientific
calculations. And by using the isympy console, you have the flexibility to
do interactive scientific analysis and work. If some functionality isn't
there yet, remember that it is under active development, and also remember
that you always can chip in and offer to help out.
