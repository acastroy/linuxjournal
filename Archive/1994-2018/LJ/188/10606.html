Last month, I closed this column with a script that can return latitude/longitude
values for two addresses, with the intent ultimately being to have the
script calculate the distance between those two points. As an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ farapart.sh "union station, denver co" \
      "union station, chicago il"
Calculating lat/long for union station, denver co
= 39.75288, -105.000473
And calculating lat/long for union station, chicago il
= 41.878658, -87.640404
</pre>
</p><p>
The formula to calculate distance actually is
pretty complicated. Here's
a JavaScript implementation of the math I showed last month:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var R    = 6371;       // kilometers
var dLat = (lat2-lat1);
var dLon = (lon2-lon1);
var a    = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
           Math.cos(lat1.toRad()) * Math.cos(lat2.toRad()) *
           Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
var c    = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
var d    = R * c;
</pre>
</p><p>
This is going to be a wee bit tricky to convert into a shell script,
needless to say, but because we have to use a more sophisticated math tool
than the built-in capabilities of Bash anyway, this also means we have a
number of options to work with, including Perl, awk and bc.
For that matter, we also can just write a quick C program that solves this
equation given four variables, but really, why make it easy when I can
make it complex? If I wanted easy, I would whip out some Perl, right?
Last month, I promised some bc, so let's see if we can make
that rusty old app do the heavy lifting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d6580.0x25ce778"></a>
Degrees to Radians</h2></div></div><p>
The first step mathematically is to convert the lat/lon values we get from
the mapping system from degrees to radians. This turns out to be
straightforward:
</p><p>
Radians = degrees * ( pi / 180 )
</p><p>
Pi, of course, is 3.1415926535897932384.
</p><p>
Given values like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
41.878658, -87.640404
</pre>
</p><p>
The radians equivalent of those is then:

<pre     class="programlisting">
0.7309204767, -1.529613605
</pre>
</p><p>
To warm up with bc, here's a simple command-line way to calculate
one of these values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "scale=8; -87.640404 * ( 3.14159265 / 180)" | bc
</pre>
</p><p>
That's all well and good, but it turns out that the different
equations I explored for calculating the distance between two points
requires the atan2() function, which isn't part of bc.
</p><p>
Rather than beat my head against the old-school wall until the bits are
bloodied, I'm going to throw in the towel and admit that this
might just be a bit too complex a mathematical problem for a shell script
and bc.

Dave Cries Uncle!</h2></div></div><p>
Having spent way more hours than I want to admit trying to get this to work
properly in bc, I'm going to &ldquo;cry uncle&rdquo; and switch temporarily into
a different programming language. I'm going to jump into C for a few
lines and whip out a simple program that, given two lat/lon pairs in
degrees, calculates the distance between them in miles (Listing 1).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d6580.0x25cee00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. C Distance Program</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#define EARTH_RADIUS       (6371.0072 * 0.6214)
#define TORADS(degrees)    (degrees * (M_PI / 180))

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   double lat1, long1, lat2, long2;
   double dLat, dLong, a, c, d;

   lat1  = TORADS(atof(argv[1]));
   long1 = TORADS(atof(argv[2]));
   lat2  = TORADS(atof(argv[3]));
   long2 = TORADS(atof(argv[4]));

   dLat  = lat2 - lat1;
   dLong = long2 - long1;

   a = sin(dLat/2) * sin(dLat/2) +
       cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dLong/2) * sin(dLong/2);
   c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a));

   printf("%g\n", EARTH_RADIUS * c);
}

</pre></div><p>
Does it work? Let's find out:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ distance 39.75288 -105.000473 41.878658 -87.640404
917.984
</pre>
</p><p>
That seems reasonable. The great circle distance between those two points
is 917 miles. Google Maps, of course, shows about 10% greater distance, but
perhaps that's because there is no direct-as-the-crow-flies route via
roads?
</p><p>
Of course, there also are errors with this formula too, because Earth
isn't a perfect sphere but rather an oblate spheroid that has a different
diameter depending on where you're measuring. But for our purposes,
let's just gloss over that problem. You can Google it to learn about
things like the Vincenty formula, but that's beyond the scope of this
ridiculous sidetrack.
</p><p>
Now we have all the pieces we need: location to lat/lon and distance
between two lat/lon points. Let's put it all together.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d6580.0x25cf220"></a>
Grafting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
To get everything to work well, I actually hacked and slashed at the
original script to make it a bit more succinct and, of course, invoke the
C &ldquo;distance&rdquo; program as shown in Listing 1. [Listing 1 also is
available on our FTP site at <a href="../listings/188/10606.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue188/10606.tgz</a>.] Ready? It's surprisingly short:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
converter="http://api.maps.yahoo.com/ajax/
&#8618;geocode?appid=onestep&amp;qt=1&amp;id=m&amp;qs="

tmpfile="/tmp/bc.script.$$"

# Get lat/long for point 1
addr="$(echo $1 | sed 's/ /+/g')"
values="$(curl -s $converter$addr | \
  cut -d\" -f13,15 | \
  sed 's/[^0-9\.\,\-]//g;s/,$//')"

lat1=$(echo $values | cut -d, -f1)
long1=$(echo $values | cut -d, -f2)

# Get lat/long for point 2
addr="$(echo $2 | sed 's/ /+/g')"
values="$(curl -s $converter$addr | \
  cut -d\" -f13,15 | \
  sed 's/[^0-9\.\,\-]//g;s/,$//')"

lat2=$(echo $values | cut -d, -f1)
long2=$(echo $values | cut -d, -f2)

# Now we have the lat/long for both points, let's
# figure out the distance between them...
dist=$(./distance $lat1 $long1 $lat2 $long2)
echo "$1 to $2 is $dist miles"
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
The script would be even shorter if we tweaked the C program to accept x,y
location pairs, but I'll leave that one to you. Instead, let's do a few tests:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ farapart.sh \
      "union station, denver, co" \
      "union station, chicago, il"
union station, denver, co to
    union station, chicago, il is 917.984 miles
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, how about something a bit more ambiguous:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ farapart.sh "long beach, ca" "boston, ma"
long beach, ca to boston, ma is 2597.53 miles
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, darn it, that seems way too short. Let's see what Yahoo Maps
reports as the distance between those two cities. Sure enough, it reports
that the trip should be 3,015 miles, not 2,597 miles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d6580.0x25cf5e8"></a>
Debugging the Math Formula</h2></div></div><p>
Somewhere there's an error that's giving us poor results. My guess is
there's some sort of significant rounding error going on in the C
program (because we can verify experimentally that the lat/lon information
we're getting is valid, simply by plugging it in to a mapping app and
seeing where it places us).
</p><p>
I'm all tapped out on this example, however. It turned out to be far more
tricky than I anticipated, and I leave it as an exercise to you, dear
reader, to see if you can figure out what's broken in the C program and
report your fix to us. We'll publish the best of them next month!
Meanwhile, next column, I'll get back to something that's more about the
shell and less about mathematics. I mean, heck, I didn't like math when I
was working on my computer science degree, so why am I playing with
it now?
