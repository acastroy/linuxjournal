Will we ever get a truly open phone?

Linux and embedded converge at the technical level, but they clash at the
cultural one. At the technical level, Linux is like an element in the periodic
table, or a pile of 2x4s. You can use it to build all kinds of stuff. Sure
enough, all kinds of stuff does get built, including embedded stuff that most
hard-core Linux hackers would never develop, or that they would develop in a very different
way. We're talking here about stuff that is typically closed as a vault. Examples
include electronic picture frames, security cameras, airplane avionics, vacuum
cleaners, assembly-line robots and medical equipment. And, of course, mobile
phones.
</p><p>
Linux has been at the heart of millions of phones made and sold during the last few
years. Few of these, however, are what you would call &ldquo;open&rdquo; to the degree that
you can do what you please with them&mdash;that is, as you would with a PC. At the low
end, phones are dumb devices that do little more than telephony. At the high end,
they're smart devices that do lots of different things. But alas, not in the same
ways&mdash;meaning, there is no &ldquo;write once, run everywhere&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Right now, the Linux smartphone market is split between Android, LiMo and Palm.
You write apps for Android in Google's own version of Java5 (described by one
developer as &ldquo;not J2ME, but not quite Java5 either&rdquo;). You write apps for LiMo in
C or C++. You write apps for Palm Pre in JavaScript. Of those three, Palm is the
only standalone vertically integrated platform, kind of like the iPhone. The LiMo
vs. Android situation is a lot more complicated. The LiMo Foundation has a pile
of big names behind it, not including Google. Google's Open Handset Alliance (all
developing for Android) includes its own pile of corporate heavyweights, some of
which also are involved with LiMo. The differences are easy to play down. For
example, LiMo focuses exclusively on middleware, while Android focuses on
applications (but covers the whole stack). But, Linux for phones is beyond forked.
Which brings me to another F-word.
</p><p>
Freedom.
</p><p>
Phone makers and phone companies don't come from freedom. They come from
control&mdash;specifically, of whole markets. Take one example from page 12 of the LiMo
Foundation's Introductory .pdf (dated July 2009). There, it explains where LiMo's
middleware platform fits in the scheme of things. Its middleware sits below three
other layers: 1) UI/Applications, &ldquo;As selected by the handset
maker/operator&rdquo;; 2)
General Content, &ldquo;As selected by the mobile consumer&rdquo;; and 3)
Applications, &ldquo;As
selected by the mobile consumer&rdquo;. In other words, LiMo primarily serves markets
that are run by handset makers and phone system operators. Of course, so do
Android and Palm. (Not meaning to pick on LiMo here; they just provide a handy
illustration.)
</p><p>
Why, as we enter the second decade of the 21st century, should we be forced to
choose only from applications provided by handset makers and mobile phone network
operators? Can't we finally have an open phone marketplace&mdash;one where users and
developers are free from control by both makers and operators, where you don't
need to get your apps from a &ldquo;store&rdquo;, where you can make any app you want, for
any purpose you want, without confining your innovations to what phone makers and
systems operators allow? Hey, that's what we've had in the PC marketplace for
going on 30 years. It's what we've had with the Internet for 15 years.
Can't we have it in the phone marketplace too?
</p><p>
In a word, no.
</p><p>
Or, in two words, not yet.
</p><p>
The problem is that the phone business has never been open or free. It's one of
the most tightly closed and highly regulated businesses on the planet. True, the
Internet started cracking open landline phone systems nearly two decades ago, but
it's still just getting started with mobile phone systems and the devices that
run on them.
</p><p>
Mobile phones today are a bridge across a chasm between protocols, technologies
and business categories. To see the big problem writ small, consider the natural
conflicts between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and SS7 (Signaling System 7).
SIP is a peer-to-peer protocol defined by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task
Force). It arose from the obvious need for IP-based calling that looks and feels
like what we're used to with phones, but without all the other hassles, such as
centralized switching and billing for everything. SS7 is defined by the ITU-T, or
the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the ITU (International
Telecommunications Union), which began as the International Telegraph Union in
1865. SS7 is the heart and soul of every phone system, including all the mobile
ones. While the IETF values &ldquo;rough consensus and running code&rdquo;, the ITU values
top-to-bottom definitional completeness. Yet to various working degrees, SIP and
SS7 coexist in our lives, devices and applications.
</p><p>
Trends favor the IETF and the Net, but I wouldn't bet that way in the short run,
which may be a decade or more. We see positive signs with smartphones and
handhelds for which telephony is one application among many. But the telephony
space is a billing space, and it still rakes in the cash. The Net may be a
&ldquo;world of
ends&rdquo; (<a href="http://worldofends.com" target="_self">worldofends.com</a>), but its means include a vastness of phone company cabling, routing and
switching. And, most of all, billing.
</p><p>
It is essential to recognize that billing is the core competency of telephony. The
Net threatens that. I'm betting the Net will win. But it will be a long, hard
fight. And Linux will be right in the middle of it, serving both sides.
