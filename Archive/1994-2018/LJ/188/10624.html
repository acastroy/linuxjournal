Cyberoam iView</h2></div></div><p>
In an effort to answer the question &ldquo;Who is doing what on my
network?&rdquo;,
the company Cyberoam has released Cyberoam iView, a new, open-source
logging and reporting solution. Cyberoam iView, says its creator,
delivers centralized identity-based logging and reporting of multiple
devices across geographical locations, thus enabling organizations to meet
their security management and regulatory compliance requirements. The
application further solves many drawbacks, such as the expense of existing
logging-reporting solutions or the need to correlate individual logs
from multiple devices like firewalls, antivirus and antispam solutions,
intrusion-prevention solutions, proxy servers, routers, operating
systems and more. One already can derive logs and reports via Linux
iptables/Netfilter firewall, the popular open-source HTTP proxy Squid
and other commercial UTM firewall solutions.

platform that supports transparent backup, quick disaster recovery from
catastrophic failures and automated application failover/failback for
improved restoration of application services. Enhancements in this new
v5.1 include enhanced support for larger environments and multi-tenancy features for MSP customers, as well as improved scalability,
platform coverage and ease of use. Support for Sun Solaris also

AXIGEN Mail Server</h2></div></div><p>
If you're in the market for a mail server with a slick Web-based e-mail
application, AXIGEN hopes you'll try its new Mail Server Version 7.2.
AXIGEN says that service providers will appreciate the new AJAX-based
Webmail, a &ldquo;cool Web experience&rdquo; for its users that &ldquo;will help them
create new services and generate new streams of income&rdquo; due to its
strong focus on monetization. The application provides multiple,
customizable advertising capabilities and seamless integration with
third-party applications, such as portals and community-related tools,
thus helping SPs keep their customers on-line for a longer period.
The application introduces features such as keyboard navigation and
shortcuts, drag and drop, live e-mail list view, frequent folders and
also allows users to employ shortcuts and time-saving tricks they 
already have been using with classic desktop e-mail clients, such as Outlook
or Thunderbird. Supported platforms include Linux, various BSDs,
Solaris and Windows.

Napatech's Time Synchronization Technology</h2></div></div><p>
Napatech has added extremely accurate packet timestamping&mdash;important
for measuring quality-of-service factors in packet networks, such as
latency&mdash;to its line of intelligent network adapters for real-time
network analysis. The new time synchronization solution enables Napatech
network adapters to be synchronized with a variety of time sources,
such as GPS, IEEE 1588v2, CDMA and Pulse Per Second sources. This feature
allows packets to be timestamped with an accuracy of 50 nanoseconds. It
also lets Napatech adapters be daisy-chained, allowing a single time
synchronization source for multiple adapters. Napatech calls its adapters
&ldquo;ideal for OEM network appliance vendors in the network performance
monitoring, test and measurement, security and optimization
markets.&rdquo; An
extensive software suite is provided for integration supporting Linux,
FreeBSD and Windows.

Jeff Duntemann's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Assembly Language Step by Step: Programming with
Linux</em></span>
(Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
New on bookstore shelves is the third edition of Jeff Duntemann's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Assembly Language Step by Step: Programming with Linux</em></span>, an introduction
to the x86 assembly language. Although this new revision has been rewritten
to focus on 32-bit protected-mode Linux and the free NASM assembler, the
book retains Duntemann's distinctive lighthearted style as he presents a
step-by-step approach to this difficult technical discipline. Duntemann
starts by explaining the basic ideas of programmable computing, the binary
and hexadecimal number systems, the Intel x86 computer architecture and
the process of software development under Linux. From that foundation,
he systematically treats the x86 instruction set, memory addressing,
procedures, macros and interface to the C-language code libraries
upon which Linux itself is built. The book assumes no prior experience
in programming.
