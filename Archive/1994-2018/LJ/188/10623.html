Discrete Geometry Viewer&mdash;Image Analysis and Manipulation
(<a href="http://qcplusplus.sourceforge.net" target="_self">qcplusplus.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Developed by Australian PhD student Shekhar Chandra at Monash
University, Discrete Geometry Viewer (DGV) is an intriguing piece of
software. As a general package, DGV, along with its various extensions,
is a quantum mechanical toolkit and 3-D viewer for C++. It allows data
visualisation via images, surface and volume plots using OpenGL, as well
as rapidly developed Quantum Mechanical Simulations. It uses the Blitz++,
VTK visualisation and open-source Qt libraries.
</p><p>
Breaking all that down, DGV allows you to do some really cool things
with images, whether your interest is scientific or purely
artistic.
The program started out as a theoretical physics project under the
moniker Quantum Mechanical Simulator, and Shekhar's main issue was in
viewing the actual data, so he wrote DGV to fill the gap. As time goes
on, Shekhar will be adding more of his PhD research work into DGV.
</p><p>
Quoting Shekhar, future advancements will include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pixel values within viewer.
</p></li><li><p>
Saving animations.
</p></li><li><p>
Python shell rather than simple console output. See my project called
QPythonShell, which allows one to embed a Python shell into Qt applications.
</p></li><li><p>
More file formats.
</p></li><li><p>
More transforms, like the Number Theoretic Transforms (via my new Number
Theoretic Transform C library).
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Click on the Download link at the main Web site, and you'll be taken to
a SourceForge page of hosted files. Under the Discrete Geometry Viewer
heading, grab the latest package according to your system. Provided are
x86 binary tarballs for Linux and Windows, as well as a source tarball. I
went with the binary, which didn't have any dependency issues on my system
and ran straight off the bat.
</p><p>
You can compile from source if you really want to&mdash;especially if you
don't have an Intel-based machine&mdash;but the list of requirements is
fairly stringent and may be a little obscure for many systems (see the
project's Web site for more details).
</p><p>
Download and extract the tarball, and open a terminal in the new
folder. To run the program, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./dgv
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
First, you need to import a picture. Any picture will
do, but in terms of number crunching, something with a smaller resolution
(say 800x600) and common aspect ratio (such as 4x3 or 16x9) will make
things easier, as both you and the computer will end up doing a fair bit
of mathematical work. Open whichever image you like with File&rarr;Open,
and the image will come up on-screen. The image that appears 
probably will be in grayscale depending on the release version, but don't fret,
it isn't necessarily going to stay that way.
</p><p>
Now, let's go straight to the program's coolest ability. Right-click
on the image and choose Surface Plot with Image from the drop-down
box. Then, wait a while. There's a lot of math to be crunched, but
it will be a quick process if you're lucky. A new 3-D landscape
now will be on-screen (and back in color), which can be moved and rotated in
real time and viewed at any angle.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10623f1.large.jpg"><img src="10623f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
DGV Creating a 3-D Texture from a Photo of My Old Drumkit
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10623f2.large.jpg"><img src="10623f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
My Old Drumkit
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10623f3.large.jpg"><img src="10623f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
DGV made this amazing 3-D landscape from a picture inside my car!
</p></div></div><p>
Left-click and move the mouse forward and backward, and the world
tilts accordingly. Move the mouse right or left, and the world
spins in that direction. Hold Ctrl while moving the mouse, and
the image rotates in front of you as if it were on a 2-D plane,
clockwise or anti-clockwise. Hold Shift or your middle mouse button,
then move the mouse, and you can physically drag the object horizontally
or vertically within your screen.
</p><p>
If you find the default values and the landscape they spawn a little crude
(or even a little subtle), right-click on the image and choose Scale
Factor. Decrease the given value, and the resulting terrain becomes
smaller and closer to the original image. This can be used to apply some
very subtle image enhancements to great effect. Increase the given value,
and the bumpiness of the terrain becomes larger and more exaggerated.
</p><p>
This by itself, however, is more of a gimmick to show off to your mates. At
the heart of this project is its mathematics and plotting abilities,
combined with techniques to manipulate images, that can result in some
stunning outcomes.
</p><p>
Let's see this in action with something a little more traditional. Close
any working project windows and start again from scratch with a basic
2-D image. With the file open, right-click on the image itself and choose
Data from the drop-down box. A table of data will be made, and it's
this table that is especially important.
</p><p>
Each cell of numbers contains information that affects any geometry
or effects you generate from this table. To put it in English, if
you know what you're doing, you can control the way the final
image ends up manually. Let's use Fast Fourier Transformation as a working
example.
(For the purposes of space, we'll run with my working filename, which is
whole-kit.jpg. Substitute your own file in place of it.)
</p><p>
Right-click on the table and choose Transform&rarr;Fourier&rarr;FFT. After
a moment, a dotted grayscale picture will come on-screen in a separate
window above the original image. Now, combine these two into a final
image. Click Data&rarr;Operate from the above menu. In the new dialog
window, choose Multiply under Operation, whole-kit.jpg under Data
Source 1 and Image: FFT-whole-kit.jpg under Data Source 2. And, there's a spiffing new image! The original image will be
combined with the grainy FFT image to make a look that is unique
to each picture.

We've barely scratched the surface here, so it's well worth
checking out Shekhar's tutorial (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/discrete-geometry-viewer/wiki/Home" target="_self">code.google.com/p/discrete-geometry-viewer/wiki/Home</a>) and
blog (<a href="http://l3mmings.blogspot.com" target="_self">l3mmings.blogspot.com</a>) to understand what this program
really is capable of doing (and apologies to Shekhar for any inaccuracies
there may be in this article). For anyone looking to explore this very
different area of image processing, DGV definitely is worth a look.

peekabot&mdash;3-D Robotic Visualization
(<a href="http://www.peekabot.org" target="_self">www.peekabot.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
According to the project's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
peekabot is a distributed real-time
3-D visualization tool for robotics researchers and developers, written
in C++. Its purpose is to simplify the visualization needs faced by a
roboticist daily&mdash;using visualization as a debugging aid or making
fancy slides for a presentation, for example.
</p><p>
Our goal is to provide a flexible tool that will cater to the
vast majority of a roboticist's visualization needs, yet is easy to
use. Typical scenarios include visualization of simulations, data display
from real robots and monitoring of remotely deployed robots.
</p><p>
...to enable remote data visualization, peekabot uses a distributed
client-server architecture. All the gory details of networking is handled
by the client library, used by your programs.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10623f5.large.jpg"><img src="10623f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
peekabot's low-level control of actions allows for some very advanced
scripting, such as the object pathing shown here.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10623f6.large.jpg"><img src="10623f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A number of Blender-created models allow for some snazzy active
objects, available freely on the Web.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Head to the Web site, and grab the latest tarball. In terms of library
requirements, the documentation helpfully states the following (note, in
the list below: *not
required when building only the client API; **needed only if building
the unit tests, which are disabled by default):

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A decently recent version of GCC.
</p></li><li><p>
Boost 1.34.0+ (Boost.Thread, Boost.DateTime, Boost.Filesystem*,
Boost.ProgramOptions* and Boost.Test**).
</p></li><li><p>
Xerces-C++ 2.7.0+*.
</p></li><li><p>
FLTK 1.1.6+*.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenGL*.
</p></li><li><p>
GLU*.
</p></li><li><p>
libpng*.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I also had to grab these development files: libxerces-c2-dev and
libfltk1.1-dev. Once you download the tarball, open a terminal
wherever it's saved and enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xvzpf peekabot-x.y.z.tar.gz 
$ cd peekabot-x.y.z
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming all went well, when the compilation has finished, you can run
the program with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ peekabot
</pre>
</p><p>
Before we jump in, I have to warn you that we've covered only half 
the equation. peekabot is made of two key parts: the server and its
clients. After the initial building process, you will have the
server by itself. The server is the main GUI screen where you'll be
testing and interacting with your client programs. The clients 
generally will be standalone programs that communicate with the peekabot
server while following their own coding structure. Although this may be
daunting for new users (me included), it does make the system very open,
powerful and flexible.
</p><p>
Okay, I'll assume you have the server window open and are ready to
take peekabot for a spin. Let's take a look at a working example program
and explore the GUI while it's running.
</p><p>
Open another terminal in the peekabot source directory, and look under
the examples folder. Here you will see the folders bo-slam, results and
skeleton. Enter any of these folders, and run the command
<tt  >make</tt>. After
make has compiled each example's code, a new program will be available
in the same directory. To use bo-slam as an example, here's the terminal
commands to enter (we'll assume you have a folder open in the peekabot
main folder):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd examples
$ cd bo-slam
$ make
$ ./bo-slam
</pre>
</p><p>
Run by itself, nothing will happen, and you will get a bunch of error
messages in the console. However, when started with the peekabot server
running alongside, a robot and a bunch of pylons will appear, with
the pylons moving themselves around the world into position and the
robot making its way around each pylon on a preprogrammed path. Okay,
now that we have something running, let's explore the GUI.
</p><p>
The main window contains the scene you'll be working with, along with a
camera whose point of view is adjustable. The left mouse button will pan
the camera, and the right button will rotate it. To zoom in and out,
use either the middle mouse button or the mouse wheel. If you need
the camera controls to be more or less sensitive, the Shift and Ctrl keys will
modulate the sensitivity accordingly (useful in extreme close-ups or
when looking from very far away, for example).
</p><p>
On the right is the Tree Browser, which contains all the active
objects, scenery elements and so on. You can select objects in view
by left-clicking, and multiple objects can be combined selectively 
like any file manager, using Ctrl to toggle select and Shift to add to
the selection.
</p><p>
I've covered only the basic operations of this program here, because
you'll need to do some actual coding to get into the nitty-gritty
of this program. And quite frankly, I'm rubbish at coding! If you're
interested in learning more, check out the basic
documentation (manual: <a href="http://www.peekabot.org/doc/latest/manual_the_basics.html" target="_self">www.peekabot.org/doc/latest/manual_the_basics.html</a>; models:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/peekabot/index.php?title=Model_repository" target="_self">sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/peekabot/index.php?title=Model_repository</a>). There you will find the coding
to get you started, along with its structure and so on.
</p><p>
Ultimately this looks to be a powerful project for robotic visualization,
albeit a rather intimidating one. Despite the relatively difficult
learning streak from its mostly coding-based interface, it's probably
this same kind of interaction that will bring it longevity. Not having
the restrictions of GUI design to hold back the mechanics surely
will be a godsend to those who want to approach their mechanical design at a
low level without the restrictions that accommodating to beginners
so often imposes.
