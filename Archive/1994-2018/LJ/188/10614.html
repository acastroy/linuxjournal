As I write these words, the global economy has been in a recession for
more than a year, bringing with it untold financial ruin for a large
number of businesses, organizations and individuals. Book and
magazine publishers have not emerged unscathed, with many downsizing
or otherwise trying to figure out how to profit (or survive) in the
Internet era.
</p><p>
But despite the current situation, publishers continue to produce a
large number of books, many of which have to do with Web- and
Internet-related technologies. If you are a Web developer, you
are fortunate to live in an era when high-quality,
open-source software is available, Web development
frameworks have become popular and easy to use, and there are
dozens of blogs on any given open-source technology. Quaint as it
might seem, printed books are tremendously useful resources that you
can and should try to use to your advantage. Blogs can be excellent,
but I still enjoy reading a well-written book that walks me
through numerous examples of a new technology or concept.
</p><p>
This month, I'm taking a break from my normal coding examples in
order to share some of the books I have looked through
and enjoyed during the past year. Most of these books are actually new,
but some of them might be just new to me or of new importance to me.
There is definitely some bias in favor of the technologies I typically
use&mdash;Linux, Ruby, PostgreSQL and Git&mdash;but I try to remain
up to date on a variety of technologies and subjects, and the list of
books reflects those interests as well.

Ruby and Rails</h2></div></div><p>
Anyone who reads this column knows I am one of the many Web
developers who loves to work with Ruby on Rails. Rails has been my
preferred development framework for several years, and I continue
to be impressed by the number of conveniences that it includes. Rails
took off because it was easy to get started with it, as David
Heinemeier Hansson demonstrated in his initial &ldquo;blog&rdquo; screencasts
several years ago. But as Rails has grown in popularity, the needs of
the sites that use it also have grown, either in functionality or
scalability. Dealing with those issues&mdash;preferably before they
cause trouble for your site&mdash;has become an important topic for
Rails developers.
</p><p>
The best book I've seen on the subject is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise Rails</em></span> by
Dan Chak (O'Reilly, ISBN 978-0-596-51520-1). One of the reasons I
like this book so much is that it focuses on aspects of Web
development that most Rails books either ignore or relegate to the
sidelines. For example, the first chapter walks you through the
creation of a Rails plugin, which Chak argues is a good way to
organize your code for easier maintenance. Whether this actually is a
good idea can be the subject of discussion and debate, but it is a
rare Rails book that discusses the creation of plugins at all, to say
nothing of addressing them as organizational tools. Chapter after
chapter in this book is similarly interesting and includes informative
discussions of database normal forms, SOA, caching, inheritance and
the use of constraints and triggers within the database to enforce
data integrity.
</p><p>
A book that covers more conventional ground, but one that is
certainly quite useful, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Rails</em></span> by Brad Ediger (O'Reilly,
ISBN 978-0-596-51032-9). <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Rails</em></span> covers many of the topics a
developer needs to consider when deploying an application and when
considering security and scalability issues. The book covers a great
many topics, and my only complaint is that it tries to cover so much,
it loses some of the depth I might have wanted. At the same
time, the book is full of references to gems, plugins and Web sites
that cover the information in greater depth (and with more working
code) than any book could reasonably be expected to include.
</p><p>
If you're looking for information about the Ruby language, rather than
the Rails framework, two new books have come out
in the past year, both of which address not only the current 1.8.x
series of Ruby, but also the 1.9.x series. These books have different
purposes and styles, and they complement each other in many ways. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Ruby Programming Language</em></span> co-authored by Java/JavaScript book-veteran
David Flanagan and Ruby creator Yukihiro &ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Matsumoto
(O'Reilly, ISBN 978-0-596-51617-8) is an attempt to document,
specifically and carefully, the language's behavior. If you are an
experienced Ruby programmer, you probably will want this book on
hand in order to explain how the language works.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em></span> by David Black (Manning,
ISBN 978-1-933988-65-8) is a much friendlier book, and it is a tutorial of
sorts&mdash;not just on the Ruby language, but also in the Ruby way of
thinking. A number of Ruby's constructs can be confusing for many
programmers, and Black's book steps through them with
numerous, well-documented examples. Black also provides a number of
tips and explanations about things that aren't always obvious, such as
the difference between singleton method definitions styles, built-in
callbacks and the various forms of eval.
</p><p>
I also thoroughly enjoyed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Metaprogramming Ruby</em></span> by Paolo Perrotta
(Pragmatic Programmers, ISBN 978-1-934356-47-0). It is easy to get
started programming with Ruby, but the real power (as with Lisp) is
not just with existing Ruby constructs, but the fact that you can
modify the language to suit your needs. Metaprogramming, as this
technique is called, lets you modify objects and classes in a variety
of ways to turn your application into a language for solving your
specific problems. Metaprogramming is a bit hard to grasp by its very
nature, and it isn't necessarily obvious how to go about using it, or why it
might be necessary. Perrotta's book offers a great deal of
well-written detail on both fronts, showing you how to use
metaprogramming techniques and suggesting when they might be
appropriate or useful.
</p><p>
Finally, I should mention Mike Gunderloy's self-published on-line PDF
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails Rescue Handbook</em></span>, which you can get from
<a href="http://www.railsrescuebook.com" target="_self">www.railsrescuebook.com</a>. Gunderloy is an active Rails
developer, author and community member, and he wrote a book that
describes what you should do when you are asked to work on a Rails
project that is not working. This book is full of practical advice
on how to attack a problematic Web site&mdash;from examining the
existing codes, to looking for database indexing issues, to the use of
metric_fu, to external monitoring with tools from New Relic or
FiveRuns. A list of what functionality was deprecated in each version
of Rails (going back to 1.0) is handy for those of us who often work
on multiple projects simultaneously and might not remember what
changed between Rails 2.1 and 2.2, for example. I didn't find any
hidden tricks or clever hacks in this book, but that's just fine.
The back-to-basics approach is thorough, well written and describes
how every Rails project can and should look over time, even if it
didn't start off following best practices.

Git Books</h2></div></div><p>
Software developers have been using version-control systems for some
time. But Git, a distributed version-control system developed by
Linus Torvalds, has taken much of the open-source world by storm. For
me, the killer feature in Git is its ridiculously simple (and fast)
branching and merging. I fall into the category of CVS and Subversion
users who have worked with those tools for years, dreading any branching or
merging operation that I would have to perform, because it was so
painful and time consuming. Git has totally changed that for me,
altering the way I develop software.
</p><p>
Numerous Web sites exist for Git users, such as &ldquo;Git ready&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.gitready.com" target="_self">www.gitready.com</a>) and the Git community book
(<a href="http://book.git-scm.com" target="_self">book.git-scm.com</a>), which offer useful information. But for a
complete introduction to Git, you might want to consider one of three
books on the subject. The first book that came out, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pragmatic
Version Control Using Git</em></span> by Travis Swicegood (Pragmatic Programmers,
ISBN 978-1-93435-615-9), is a good introduction to Git and covers the
basics nicely.
</p><p>
However, I felt that this book was lacking some depth and was
happy to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Version Control with Git</em></span> by Jon Loeliger (O'Reilly,
ISBN 978-0-596-52012-0) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Git</em></span> by Scott Chacon (Apress,
ISBN 978-1-4302-1833-3). Chacon is well known in the Git community as one
of the founders of GitHub and as a screencaster, author and speaker
about Git. Chacon convinced Apress to put the book on-line for free
(<a href="http://progit.org/book" target="_self">progit.org/book</a>), so you can take a look for
yourself. I have found that the Loeliger and Chacon books complement
each other, and I've been reading them in parallel, learning from
both. You can't go wrong with either one of them.

Web Development and Administration</h2></div></div><p>
No matter what technologies your Web site uses, certain issues will
crop up. For example, you will have to map out a database and server
architecture, ensure that your server's performance is being
monitored, and set your URLs and content to reflect best SEO (search
engine optimization) practices. It is unlikely that one person on a
Web site will need to tackle such a wide variety of problems 
alone, but if you are a freelance developer, knowing about
different tools can be quite helpful and makes you even more valuable
to your clients.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Website Optimization</em></span> by Andrew B. King (O'Reilly, ISBN
978-0-596-51508-9) is a good introduction to the subject of optimizing
your site in a number of ways, both for SEO and for speed. Generally, I've been quite skeptical
of SEO in the past, thinking (somewhat naively) that with well-written
content, Google and other search engines will find you and mark you as
relevant. It turns out that well-written content is necessary but
insufficient. This book shows what you can do to improve in that
arena. To be honest, I have read the SEO portions of this book much
more thoroughly than the performance-related optimization portions,
some of which I have seen elsewhere.
</p><p>
A well-known business mantra says, &ldquo;If you can't measure it, you can't
improve it.&rdquo; For this reason, getting a handle on how your Web site
performs is a crucial task if you are to understand where and how you
can improve it. The book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Complete Web Monitoring</em></span> by Alistair Croll
and Sean Power (O'Reilly, ISBN 978-0-596-15513-1) is the most
comprehensive list of Web monitoring tools and techniques I have
seen to date, looking at every type of monitoring I can think of
and then some. It describes how to monitor your site's network
connectivity, performance, conversion rates and usability,
recommending a mixture of built-in, open-source and commercial tools.
It even describes ways in which you can use on-line communities and
social networks to monitor reactions to your site, so that the
analysis you get is not just a bunch of statistics.
</p><p>
JavaScript continues to occupy center stage in the Web development
world. If you aren't yet using a JavaScript framework, by all
means, you should start! Frameworks (such as Prototype/Scriptaculous,
jQuery, YUI and Dojo) allow you to ignore most of the differences
between browsers and provide a huge amount of support for the type of
development that you likely want to do. I typically prefer to use
jQuery and enjoyed the introductory <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning jQuery</em></span> by Jonathan
Chaffer and Karl Swedberg (Packt Publishing, ISBN 978-1-847192-50-9)
as a good introduction to that framework.
</p><p>
Many serious developers now are working on JavaScript in
various ways, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>JSMag</em></span> is a new for-pay, PDF publication that aims to
give such developers serious articles (<a href="http://www.jsmag.com" target="_self">www.jsmag.com</a>).
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JSMag</em></span>
reminds me of other language-specific magazines I have seen over
the years, with very high-quality content that addresses topics
developers need to deal with. It tries to be framework-neutral,
meaning you are as likely to read an article about YUI or jQuery
as Ext or Dojo, so if you are interested only in jQuery, you might be
slightly disappointed. That said, a majority of the articles are
about using the JavaScript language, rather than any one particular
framework, which means that no matter what you're using, you will
probably get something out of <span   class="emphasis"><em>JSMag</em></span>.
</p><p>
Finally, two well-known figures in the Ruby community, Amy Hoy and
Thomas Fuchs (the latter of whom is the author of the Scriptaculous
visualization framework that works with Prototype) have published an
on-line PDF book called <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript Rocks!</em></span>, available for purchase and
download from <a href="http://jsrocks.com" target="_self">jsrocks.com</a>. If you are familiar with Hoy's
writing, you won't be surprised that this book is an easy
read, with a terrific sense of humor and high-quality technical
content, addressing everything from reducing JavaScript code size to
improving the perceived (not actual!) performance of your
application's user interface. The book comes with a copy of the
terrific &ldquo;DOM Monster&rdquo; tool for optimizing the number and type of DOM
elements on a page and for an instant analysis of your page.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article presents just a small sample of the books I've
enjoyed this past year. Authors and publishers continue to
release new, good books that are not only useful, but also interesting
to read. It's rare for me to read a technical book and not be able to
use at least something from it within a few days of reading it. The
books I've mentioned here stand out from the crowd because they have
provided me with a particularly large helping of food for thought. I
look forward to this-coming year's helping of books and to the
interesting things that I will learn from them as well.
