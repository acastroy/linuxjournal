It's not always clear what separates ordinary Linux from embedded Linux.
This article takes a look at the parts that
make up a typical embedded system, starting with the bootloader
and ending with end-user applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfeb2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The very first step in starting an embedded Linux system does not involve
Linux at all. Instead, the processor is reset and starts executing
code from a given location. This location contains a bootloader that
initializes the device and sets up the basic necessities. When everything
has been prepared, the Linux kernel is loaded and started. The kernel
then initializes all the devices before mounting the filesystems and
starting the userspace applications.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel and userspace are not merely a simple blob that is
loaded and run. The kernel consists of a system-specific configuration
and usually some tweaked initialization code. The userspace holds
software libraries, data and several applications, all interacting to
form a system. Each of these components is handpicked for the task and
device in question in order to get a compact and well-performing system.
Figure 1 shows the basic sequence of events.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfeb670"></a>
The Bootloader</h2></div></div><p>
The bootloader is among the first pieces of software to run on the system. It
basically has two tasks: initialize the system and load the
kernel. The initialization can be to set up a UART to be used as a serial
debug console and to configure the system's memory controller. For
instance, if your system is using an SDRAM, you probably will have to
set up the controller with regard to the memory's physical features. This
includes page sizes, the number of columns, supported read and write
widths, latencies and so on. In these days of portable devices, there is
usually a plethora of settings for saving power when it comes to
memory.
</p><p>
In addition to the basic tasks required by the bootloader, it is typical
to provide some sort of command prompt where common low-level tasks can
be carried out. These tasks usually include peeking and poking at random
memory addresses, downloading and storing a Linux kernel image in Flash
and setting bootargs for the kernel to interpret.
</p><p>
Examples of common bootloaders for embedded systems are Das U-Boot
and RedBoot. Both support the basic tasks&mdash;meaning they can manage
Flash, networking and serial communication. They also are available for
several processor platforms, such as x86, ARM, PowerPC and more. You 
can add your own commands to both of them as well. This makes it possible to
debug custom hardware without involving Linux, reducing the complexity
of the system during the testing phase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfeb880"></a>
The Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
The kernel itself is not very different from an ordinary desktop
kernel. However, there are two major differences. First is the
initialization, which often is system-specific. Second is that you
probably know exactly what hardware will be used, so
you can include all the drivers as part of the kernel and avoid the
need for modules (unless you have proprietary drivers, of course).
</p><p>
When starting a desktop or a server system, the common scenario is that
the kernel probes for hardware and loads the corresponding drivers
as modules. This makes it possible to add hardware and still have
a working system. You also can add drivers for new hardware without
having to recompile the entire kernel. On an embedded system, you can
optimize boot time by including all drivers in the kernel, but also by
hard-coding parts of the available hardware, avoiding the need to
probe for all devices and settings.
</p><p>
Returning to the standard PC, each machine starts and looks about the
same during initialization. In the embedded case, each piece of hardware is
unique,
and you generally have to initialize the custom hardware. This means
you actually will have to write code to set up your kernel for your
board, which is usually easier than you think. For starters, 
lots of boards already are supported in the Linux kernel, and you usually can
choose one of
those as a starting point. Second, there are drivers for the most common
peripherals, and again, you typically can find a good starting point,
even when you have to create something of your own. So, the process is
more or less to study the data sheets for your board and express what you learn to
the kernel (something that can be both intimidating and daunting).
</p><p>
Embedded systems often are more limited than your average computer
when it comes to system resources, so it is important to
keep your kernel's footprint small. That, in turn, makes the kernel
configuration stage important. By limiting configuration to a minimum,
you can save those extra bytes needed to fit everything in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfebae8"></a>
The C Library</h2></div></div><p>
The standard C library is one of the key components of any Linux
system. It provides the userspace applications with a predefined
interface, making them portable across different versions of the Linux
kernel, as well as between different UNIX dialects. It basically acts
as a bridge between the userspace applications and the kernel.
</p><p>
The version of the C library you usually find on your desktop
machine is the GNU C library, glibc. It is a full-fledged C library,
and, thus, a very large piece of software. For embedded systems, 
a few smaller alternatives are available: uClibc, newlib, dietlibc and
others. These libraries try to implement the most commonly used interfaces
in a minimalist way. This means they are mostly compatible with
glibc, but not fully.
</p><p>
So, what does the C library contain that can be removed? uClibc, for
example, skips the database library, limits the number of authentication
methods that are supported, does not fully implement locale support,
limits the math library mostly to doubles and leaves out some encryption
functions. In addition, the kernel's structures are
used directly whenever possible. Those and other things significantly
reduce the size of the library.
</p><p>
What does this mean to you as an embedded developer? Most important,
it means you can save quite a bit of memory, although you do so at the
cost of compatibility. For instance, the decision to use the kernel's
structures when applicable means the stat structure is different
from the one used by glibc. You also have to limit yourself to flat
password files and shared password files, unless you want to add a
third-party library to handle authentication. More limitations exist, but
generally speaking, most software compiles happily without patching.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfebcf8"></a>
BusyBox</h2></div></div><p>
When you have a bootloader, a kernel and a standard library, the next
thing on the wish list usually is a command prompt. One of the big stars
in the embedded Linux world is BusyBox. The idea behind the project is
that most standard applications, such as ls, cd, mkdir, ping and so on,
share a lot of code. Compiling each program separately means that code
handling things such as command-line arguments is repeated in each
application. BusyBox solves this problem by providing a single program,
busybox, that can handle all the tasks provided by all the standard
applications. By creating symbolic links for all the individual commands
and pointing them to BusyBox, the user can still enter the expected
commands and get the expected results.
</p><p>
As with everything else in the embedded world, tuning and tweaking is
important. When it comes to BusyBox, you can handpick which commands
to include, and for some commands, you even can handpick which command-line
arguments are supported. If you don't need a particular command, simply
don't include it in BusyBox. For instance, why keep ifconfig if you
don't have a network?
</p><p>
When building a dynamically linked, default configured BusyBox on a
desktop PC, it results in a binary that is just less than 700KB. This binary
represents more than 200 commands and occupies more than 6MB of disk space on my
Kubuntu-based system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfebf08"></a>
Adding More</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have all the key components in place, you can start building and
populating a root filesystem. This involves adding BusyBox, device files
and expected directories. You also might want to add /etc/password and
/etc/shadow, init scripts and so on. All this is necessary, but to get your
device to do something, you need to add your own applications.
</p><p>
When developing for embedded devices, you might find yourself in a
system completely without a graphical interface. This usually means
implementing your functionality as some sort of server. As more and
more devices are networked, a Web server often takes the place of a user
interface. Because Apache is a large piece of software, a common solution is
to use a lightweight server, such as Boa, for configuration and information.
</p><p>
If you happen to have a display, you likely will want to put graphics on
it. An X sever might sound like a solution, but the two most common toolkits
for building graphical interfaces, Qt and GTK+, also support using the
framebuffer directly&mdash;again, saving both memory and computing resources.
</p><p>
And, that is what engineering embedded devices is all about: making
the most with as little as possible. Being able to fit the coolest
features into a small system means bringing an attractive device, at a
good price, to consumers. Using embedded Linux to do that
means you can get done more quickly, cheaply and be more hackable than with
a closed-source system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfec118"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Filesystems</b></p><p>
Choosing a filesystem for your embedded system depends on many factors. Do
you need to be able to write to it? Do you value size or speed? Do you
want to be able to replace the filesystem without replacing the kernel?
</p><p>
You also need to be aware of your storage medium's limitations. For
instance, Flash has a limitation when it comes to how many times each
cell can be written. To prolong the life of a Flash-based device, it's
a good idea to use a filesystem that has been adapted for this purpose.
</p><p>
There are numerous filesystems from which to choose, but the following three
are interesting as they show some important factors you should
take into consideration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
initramfs: a filesystem that is embedded into the kernel image. If
your kernel is compressed, the initramfs filesystem is decompressed alongside the kernel. This gives the system a performance advantage. The
filesystem is kept in RAM as the device operates and can be modified.
However, all modifications are lost upon reboot.
</p></li><li><p>
cramfs/squashfs: two compressed read-only filesystems. Both of these
systems let you create a compressed image that you can mount at
runtime. The filesystem can be replaced without touching the kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
jffs2/ubifs: compressed filesystems tuned for Flash devices. These
filesystems can be written to permanently, and they try to minimize the
&ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; of the Flash blocks by spreading write operations across
the device.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Luckily, you do not have to pick one of these filesystems; instead, you
can mix them&mdash;for instance, starting from an initramfs image with the
most basic tools and then mounting a jffs2 Flash partition for storing
user data. As Linux allows you to mount filesystems into any location in
your directory tree, you can make this transparent to the applications
using the filesystem. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfec6f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Cross Compilation</b></p><p>
One of the interesting aspects of embedded development is that you are
likely to encounter new processor families. Most of you have x86 hardware
at home; some might have a SPARC, 68k or a MIPS system lying around.
With embedded systems, you are likely to run into ARM, SH, PowerPC
or MIPS, among others.
</p><p>
The implication of this is that you must cross compile everything
from your desktop build machine (your host machine) for your target
device. The resulting binaries cannot be run directly on your desktop
machine. You can do it using emulators such as QEMU that allow you to
emulate common CPUs, but you will have to do some testing and probably
some debugging on your target device.
</p><p>
Sometimes you can get a cross compiler from a vendor or distribution.
You also can build your own. Building your own cross compiler used to be a real
pain, but these days, you can use crosstool from Dan Kegel. Crosstool
is a set of scripts and patches that allows you to build gcc and standard
libraries for your platform of choice.
</p><p>
Crosstool's greatest feature is that you can (attempt to) build any
combination of compiler and standard library. This makes it easy to try
to build a toolchain for an existing device. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef3580.0xfeca08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Distributions and Frameworks</b></p><p>
As fun as it is to roll your own, sometimes time does not permit it.
A number of commercial players exist in the embedded Linux
field, and many freely developed tools for building
a complete embeddable environment also are available. The following list contains a few 
tools you might consider using:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Buildroot: a set of Makefiles and patches for building a complete
embeddable system. It generates everything from the cross compiler, the
kernel and software libraries, and the userspace applications. The resulting
system uses uClibc.
</p></li><li><p>
&Aring;gstr&ouml;m distribution: another build framework for building embedded
Linux systems. It also sports a package manager. This makes it possible
to add and remove applications from the device directly, instead of having
to build and download an entire system image or copy the application's
files to the right locations manually.
</p></li><li><p>
ScratchBox: a build framework for making embedded Linux application
development easier. It has gained adoption through the Maemo development
platform (the Nokia N7/8/9xx Internet tablets). It supports cross
compiling entire distributions, can switch between glibc and uClibc and
uses QEMU emulation of targets.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In all of those cases, it takes a bit of work to get the distributions
running on a new system. As always with embedded systems, nothing is
standardized, and size usually matters, so a bit of tweaking is more or less
inevitable. However, having a framework for building a working system
can be a real time-saver.
