Put modern crypto onto your legacy applications without
modifying them. Mick Bauer shows how to bring pre-SSL programs
up to date.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266b348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The world is full of network applications that get things done, have
withstood the test of time and have rotten security. Telnet? Brilliant
in its simplicity and versatility, but it transmits your login
credentials in clear text. rcp? Ever so ubiquitous and scriptable, but rhosts-based authentication's time has come and gone,
thanks to IP spoofing.
</p><p>
Sure, you can swap those old warhorses for their
encrypted successors&mdash;SSH instead of telnet
and scp or rsync-over-SSH for rcp. Or, you can build
an all-purpose IPSec tunnel to each remote host with which you
communicate. But the latter often is overkill,
and the former is easier said than done if your
choice of applications in a given scenario isn't
completely within your control. Surely there's a way to
add strong encryption to legacy network applications.
</p><p>
Consider the mighty SSL wrapper, Stunnel. This
month, I explain how to use Stunnel 4.0 in tandem with OpenSSL
to bring your legacy applications into the modern era, security-wise.
And what about wireless? If you're compelled to use a clear-text network
application over a weakly secured wireless medium, such as 802.11b, can
Stunnel help? Read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266b500"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
You need to understand two things in order to use
Stunnel. First, know how your network application uses the network. If it's a
simple single-TCP-port application such as telnet, which does all its
listening on TCP 23, Stunnel works. If it uses UDP, the portmapper
service or any other dynamic port-allocation scheme, Stunnel can't help
you. For example, RPC applications don't work, because they use portmapper.
FTP uses TCP 21 for control traffic but dynamically assigns arbitrary
high ports for data connections, so it's also disqualified.
</p><p>
Second, you need to understand the basics of public key cryptography
but not necessarily the ins and outs of X.509 or Public Key
Infrastructures. I've described how this works in several
previous columns, such as &ldquo;The 101 Uses of OpenSSH, Part II&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, January 2001].
For now, suffice it to say that in public key cryptography, each
participant has two keys: a public key that you share with the other
participants and a private key that only you possess. Other people
use your public key to encrypt things that they want only you to see;
you use your private key to decrypt those things.
</p><p>
Digital signatures work backward from encryption. If you sign something
with your private key, anybody can use your public key to verify that
the signature was generated with your private key and therefore by
you. Again, this depends on only you possessing your private key,
no matter how many people have copies of your public key.
</p><p>
In the X.509 world, we call the public key a certificate, which,
technically, is a public key bundled with digitally signed information
about the public key's owner, including name and e-mail address. We call the
private key simply the key. Somewhat confusingly, we sometimes refer
to both of them, together, as a certificate. Context helps: when I
talk about a passphrase-free certificate, you know I'm talking about a
combined key/certificate because the certificate itself, being a public
key, can't have a passphrase.
</p><p>
That's by far the most concise explanation I've ever given of
public key cryptography and X.509. If it isn't enough for you
to decipher the rest of this article, read the Stunnel FAQ
or the mighty RSA Crypto FAQ (see the on-line Resources section)
for more
information. Now it's time to plunge into Stunnel proper.

Installing Stunnel</h2></div></div><p>
Chances are, your Linux distribution of choice includes a binary package
for Stunnel. Recent releases of SuSE, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise all
include Stunnel version 4. Debian 3.0 (Woody) includes Stunnel version
3.22.
</p><p>
On the one hand, 3.22 is a stable version that's well documented
and well understood.
On the other hand, Stunnel version 4 is a major rewrite that, among
other things, allows for easier management of multiple tunnels. It's
the version I'm covering here. If you run Debian, I think it's worth your
while to download the latest Stunnel source
and compile it yourself.
</p><p>
Compiling Stunnel on any Linux distribution is quick and easy. First,
make sure you've already got your distribution's packages for OpenSSL, probably
called openssl; OpenSSL development libraries, openssl-devel or
libssl096-dev; and TCPwrapper development libraries, libwrap0-dev
on Debian, included as part of SuSE's and Fedora's base installations.
Then, unpack Stunnel's source code tarball and do a quick:

<pre     class="programlisting">

./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
If for some reason that doesn't work, entering
<tt  >./configure --help</tt> lists advanced precompile configuration options you
can pass to the configure script.
Once you've installed Stunnel, it's time to create some certificates
and start tunneling.
</p><p>
Most of what follows applies only to Stunnel v.4.0.0 and later.
If you choose to use, for example, Debian's Stunnel 3.22 package, you
need to refer to the documentation included with that package or to the
examples on the Stunnel Web site (see Resources); most of that Web site still covers
the older version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266bb30"></a>Creating Certificates with OpenSSL</h2></div></div><p>
A Stunnel server&mdash;that is, a host that receives encrypted
packets destined for a local clear-text service&mdash;requires a server
certificate. A Stunnel client does not, however, unless you intend
to configure your Stunnel server to use client-certificate
authentication. Sadly, client-certificate authentication is
beyond the scope of this article, so none of our examples require
the client to have its own certificate&mdash;only the server does.
</p><p>
If you installed Stunnel after compiling from source and issuing
a <tt  >make install</tt> command, you've already got a server certificate
(/usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem). If you installed Stunnel from a
binary package, the package's post-installation script may or may not
have created a server certificate for you.
</p><p>
Fedora Core 1's Stunnel RPM creates an empty certificate for
some reason. Needless to say, you need a proper certificate, and
the way to do that on Fedora is to change your working directory to
/usr/share/ssl/certs, type <tt  >make stunnel.pem</tt> and copy stunnel.pem to the
directory /etc/stunnel. This certificate, as with certificates
created by the Stunnel source-release Make script, has no
passphrase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266bd98"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Danger of Passphrase-Free Certificates</b></p><p>
Using a server certificate that's been generated automatically or semi-automatically
by a script is quick and convenient, but there's one problem:
such a certificate nearly always is created with no passphrase. On the
one hand, you can and should set the permissions and ownership on your
certificate to make it root-readable only, so at least unprivileged
users on your system aren't able to read and thus use it. On
the other hand, if your system is root-compromised, your passphrase-free
certificate then can be used and abused by the attacker.
</p><p>
This may be an acceptable risk for you, and indeed, using passphrase-free
server certificates is a common practice. After all, it's
inconvenient to require a human being to enter a certificate's passphrase
every time Stunnel starts up. However, as a matter of principle,
crypto experts widely consider it reckless to use passphrase-free
certificates. If a process is sensitive enough to warrant cryptography
in the first place, the argument goes, it's sensitive enough to require
a human being to start that process.
</p></div><p>
If your Stunnel server system needs a server certificate, or if your automatically generated
certificate doesn't meet your needs&mdash;for example, it lacks a
passphrase&mdash;you need to generate your own, using the OpenSSL command. Space
does not permit me to give a full, proper explanation of this powerful
tool. Luckily, the Stunnel FAQ (see Resources)
answers some of the most common questions about how OpenSSL and Stunnel
interact, and it includes pointers to further sources of information about
OpenSSL.
</p><p>
Suffice it to say that for some users, there may be a compelling
reason to create their own Certificate Authority (CA), install their
CA certificate (but not key) on every system running Stunnel and use
their CA certificate to sign all server certificates. This is necessary,
for example, if you want your Stunnel server systems to accept client
connections only from Stunnel client hosts with particular certificates.
</p><p>
For many if not most Stunnel users, however, it's good enough to use
self-signed certificates and to not worry about being or not being a
CA. Here's how to generate a self-signed server certificate using
OpenSSL.


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266c160"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

nearclient:/etc/stunnel# chmod 600 stunnel.pem

</pre></div><p>
In Listing 1, the real meat is in the first line. Parsing
from left to right, this command tells OpenSSL to create a certificate
request in the X.509 digital certificate format, using the RSA cipher
with a 1,024-bit key, good for 365 days and with both its key and (public)
certificate written to the same file, stunnel.pem.
If you instead want to create a password-free certificate, you can include
the -nodes option at the end. Read the sidebar &ldquo;The Danger of
Passphrase-Free Certificates&rdquo; first, though.
</p><p>
Most of the rest of Listing 1 shows a dialog in which OpenSSL prompts
me for X.509-type information to include in the certificate, including Country and Region. That stuff should be self-explanatory, but
Common Name is very important. If you're creating a server certificate,
the certificate's Common Name must be set to the fully qualified
domain name (that is, the full hostname) of the host that is going to use
the certificate.
</p><p>
Most SSL/TLS-enabled applications expect this Common Name to resolve
by way of DNS to the IP address of your server. Stunnel does not unless you
configure it to, but setting Common Name to your FQDN is a good habit
to get into nonetheless.
</p><p>
In the last line of Listing 1, I've set the permissions of my new server
certificate to 0600 (-rw-------). Because I ran my OpenSSL
command as root, this file already is owned by root. It's important for
any server certificate, whether it's password-protected or not, to be
root-readable only. I ran my OpenSSL command from
within /etc/stunnel, so my certificate was created in place, and I didn't
have to move my new certificate there by hand.

Configuring Stunnel's Global Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've got a suitable server certificate, it's time to configure
yourself a tunnel. This is considerably simpler than the
previous task.
This part is also much more version-specific. In versions of Stunnel
prior to version 4.0, Stunnel accepted all of its configuration parameters as
command options. In current versions, however, the only actionable command-line
argument it expects is the nondefault path to its configuration file.
</p><p>
If you installed Stunnel from source with default compile-time
options, Stunnel expects its configuration file to reside in
/usr/local/etc/stunnel. If you installed from a binary package, this
path is more likely to be /etc/stunnel.
Listing 2 shows the global settings from an abbreviated sample
stunnel.conf file (abbreviated mainly in that I've omitted
comment lines).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266c688"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Global Settings in stunnel.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
chroot = /var/run/stunnel/
pid = /stunnel.pid
setuid = nobody
setgid = nogroup
debug = 7
output = /var/log/stunnel.log
client = yes
</pre></div><p>
The cert parameter tells Stunnel where to look for its
server certificate; it therefore follows that you need this
parameter only on your Stunnel server host, not on client hosts. The chroot parameter tells Stunnel which
directory to chroot itself (reset / to) after starting up; this happens after Stunnel has read its configuration and
server certificate files. You probably need to create this
chroot jail manually and populate it with a few things, for example,
its own etc/hosts.allow and etc/hosts.deny files, if you want to use
TCPwrappers-style access controls.
</p><p>
pid tells Stunnel where to write its process ID. This
path is relative to that set by chroot; that is, Stunnel writes
its PID after chrooting itself.
</p><p>
setuid and setgid tell Stunnel which user and group to demote
itself to after starting. If Stunnel is to listen on any TCP ports
lower than 1025 it must be started as root, but it demotes itself
after reading its configuration file, reading its server certificate
and binding to the privileged port.
</p><p>
By default, Stunnel sends its log messages of severity notice or
higher to the local d&aelig;mon syslog facility. Fedora's version sends it
to authpriv, which in turn logs to /var/log/secure. You can use the
debug option to set a different log level. Seven is the highest level
and is best if you're having trouble getting Stunnel to work. You can
use the output option to tell Stunnel to send its messages to a
specific file rather than handing its messages off to syslog.
</p><p>
The last line in Listing 2 sets the client parameter to yes,
which means that on this particular system, I intend to initiate SSL
transactions, not receive them. On the server with which I intend to
communicate, I need to leave this parameter set to its default, no.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x266ca50"></a>
Configuring a Tunnel</h2></div></div><p>
Now, finally, we come to the payoff&mdash;an actual tunnel. For this example,
we're going to tunnel telnet from the host nearclient to the server
farserver. The global section in farserver's stunnel.conf file can be
almost identical to the one in Listing 2, except that the
client needs to be set to no. The major difference between
the two hosts' configurations is in their service definitions.
</p><p>
Before I dive into that, however, let's flesh out the example scenario a
little more. Suppose farserver already is configured as a telnet server;
it already accepts telnet sessions on TCP port 23. But, we don't want
nearclient to connect to the clear-text port; we need to use something
else for an SSL connection. As it happens, IANA has already designated
a port for SSL-enabled telnet (aka telnets): TCP 992.
</p><p>
Therefore, we want a tunnel from nearserver to TCP 992 on
farserver. But how will our non-SSL-enabled telnet command and our equally
non-SSL-savvy telnet server process know how to use this tunnel? That's a
trick question; the tunnel is completely transparent to the sending
and receiving telnet processes.
</p><p>
nearserver's Stunnel process accepts the connection on the usual
port&mdash;TCP 23 although this is user-defined&mdash;and then encrypts
the packets with
SSL before forwarding them to TCP port 992 on farserver. farserver
decrypts the packets and then forwards them to its local telnet process
on TCP 23. Actually, xinetd or inetd receive the packets before
in.telnetd does, but you get the picture.
</p><p>
In this way, when users on nearserver want to connect to farserver,
they enter the command <tt  >telnet 127.0.0.1</tt>, and
connection is encrypted, forwarded to farserver and decrypted. farserver's reply
packets follow the same path but backward. Each telnet process
(telnet and in.telnetd) thinks it's communicating with a local user,
but the packets in fact are traversing an SSL-encrypted Stunnel
session.
All of which is a wordy way of explaining the six total lines
that comprise Listings 3 and 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x26635f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Service Definition on nearclient</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
[telnets]
accept = 23
connect = farserver.wiremonkeys.org:992
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x2663808"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. Service Definition on farserver</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
[telnets]
accept = 992
connect = 23
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, a service definition can be as simple as a pair of lines,
an accept line to designate a listening port and a connect
line to designate a destination port.
Precisely what this means depends on whether a given system is
a Stunnel client or a Stunnel server. On a client system, client =
yes, Stunnel expects clear-text packets on its accept port and
sends encrypted packets to the connect port. On a server system, client = no, Stunnel listens for SSL connections (encrypted
packets) on its accept port and sends decrypted packets to the
connect port.
</p><p>
Also notice that on a client, in your connect statement you
probably need to specify not only a port but also a remote hostname or
IP address, as in Listing 3, <tt  >connect =
farserver.wiremonkeys.org:992</tt>.
</p><p>
According to the way we've configured things in Listings 3 and 4, any host can
connect to TCP port 23 on nearserver and traverse nearserver's tunnel
to farserver. We can restrict this in any number of ways, including by
using
iptables. We can tell Stunnel to accept only local connections to
the Stunnel client process, however, by using <tt  >accept =
127.0.0.1:23</tt> on nearclient.
</p><p>
This technique would work on farserver as well. If farserver has multiple
interfaces, eth0, wlan0, ppp0 and so on, you can write your accept
statement to specify the IP address of the interface on which you want it to
receive tunneled packets in the same way. On both Stunnel clients
and servers, the default IP for accept statements is any (all
local interfaces), and the default IP for connect statements is
127.0.0.1 (localhost).
</p><p>
What about the telnet server on farserver? After all, clear-text telnet
sessions seldom are a good idea. Therefore, in practice you want to
be sure to add the line <tt  >bind = 127.0.0.1</tt> to your /etc/xinetd/telnet
script, so that only local processes can connect to TCP 23.
</p><p>
Once you've finished configuring Stunnel on client and server, start
Stunnel simply by typing the command <tt  >stunnel</tt>. You don't need to worry
about starting it on the server before starting it on the client; the
client doesn't initiate a tunnel until you try to use it, for example,
by trying to start a telnet session. If either or both hosts are using
a password-protected server certificate, you are prompted for it now.
Keep this in mind if you set up a Stunnel startup script. Once you've
entered the certificate, you should be up and running.
</p><p>
You now can check for successful startup by issuing a quick <tt  >ps
auxw</tt>
and looking for a Stunnel process&mdash;Stunnel returns no output to the
console whether or not it starts cleanly. It does, however, send messages
to your system's syslog facility, including startup messages.
</p><p>
Once stunnel is running on both client and server, our users on nearclient
can trigger a tunnel by connecting to nearclient's TCP port 23, for
example, with the command <tt  >telnet 127.0.0.1</tt> (23 is telnet's default
port). Listing 5 shows a sample encrypted-telnet session.

As you can see, from the end-user's perspective, connecting to farserver
in this way is practically indistinguishable from any other telnet
session. The bash prompt at the end of the listing, however, confirms
that we have in fact connected to farserver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2573580.0x2664150"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Stunnel and inetd/xinetd</b></p><p>
I have a confession. The examples in this article do not show the
most efficient way to use Stunnel to encrypt telnet, although I
assure you I've tested these examples, and they do work.
</p><p>
My justification is I wanted to illustrate the concept
of tunneling generic TCP services quickly, using a technique that works for
practically any single-TCP-port service. But telnet, pop3 and other
services typically started by a super-server, such as inetd or
xinetd, are supported through several different Stunnel features that
are beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
For example, a Stunnel server can, rather than forward packets
with a connect statement, pass them to a process that Stunnel
invokes itself with the exec parameter in stunnel.conf.
Alternatively, you can configure Stunnel itself to be
invoked dynamically by inetd or xinetd.
</p><p>
For more information on using Stunnel with dynamically started
d&aelig;mons or in conjunction with inetd or xinetd, see the stunnel(8)
man page and the Stunnel FAQ.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And that, I hope, is enough to start you down the path of Stunnel
mayhem. As usual, I've scratched only the surface. I leave it up to you to
explore Stunnel's ability to authenticate tunnels with client-certificate
checking, its support for TCPwrappers-style access controls and the
myriad global and service-specific options supported in stunnel.conf. Let
the stunnel(8) man page be your guide, and may your single-TCP-port-using
unencrypted-TCP applications be eavesdroppable no more.
