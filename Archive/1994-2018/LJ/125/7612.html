A new nonprofit training center combines open-source course materials, top-ranked instructors
and realistic work environments together for classroom or on-site training.

More is involved in information transparency than
mere software. In Mountain View, California, we
are working on new methods of training using open
course materials. The Freedom Technology Center (FTC)
is an educational organization founded to provide
high-level technical training to local and on-line
communities. The curriculum is based on freely
available technical courseware and software courses
derived from free software or open-source software
projects. What follows is an introduction to FTC
and a brief report on what we are doing.
</p><p>
Doc Searls points out that IT is being driven more and
more from the demand side, and that's the direction
from which we approach training. We understand the
trend of empowerment that open-source software is a
part of, and we are designing training programs to
fit into that paradigm. These days, virtually any
IT task can be tackled by a smart self-learner who receives
a good introduction from a professional. According to
the MIT OCW Program Evaluation Findings Report (March
2004), self-learners are far and away the largest
group using freely available training materials.
FTC is here to give self-learners a solid introduction
and, in many cases, a working sandbox. We kickstart
self-learners on the road to competence with freely
available tools, training and courseware.
</p><p>
For public benefit, we host free training events to boost awareness
and competence on open technical courseware. This is the fun part.
We have hosted free training events on spam filtering, trusted
computing and open hardware. We ran a book donation drive for the
Linux Users Group of Iraq and fund-raisers for FTC and the Free Software
Foundation (FSF). As a
rule, we try to support Linux users groups and organizations, such as the
FSF and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wherever we can.
In short, we support the generation,
dissemination, preservation and protection of technical knowledge
whenever possible.
</p><p>
We also kickstart corporate self-learners, providing high-quality,
hands-on, modular courses. This is the hard work that keeps our
lights on. The only way for us to compete is our quality. FTC offers
the highest quality training experience available on the topics that
we instruct. Our method is first to identify and recruit the single
best trainer for each training class we offer. Our instructors
all have written the book on their given topic. With the best possible
instructor on a topic, and an all-inclusive, hands-on, practical
offering, we keep quality at a maximum. We're not the cheapest for
corporate training, but in general, if we can't be the best, we don't
offer the course. Lucky for us, high-quality trainers seem to like
our style.
</p><p>
Geographically, we serve the local technical community in Northern
California and a larger on-line community that can access our course
notes over the Internet. Our trainers take paid training courses on
the road, matching free seminars for users groups and tradeshows on
open courseware with paid events for professional users. If we
administer it right, we can offer a self-funding free training event or
two in any metropolitan area.
</p><p>
Content-wise, we're focusing on open-source applications that people are using
in business right now, and that means Samba and OpenLDAP. We have Linux
certification and spam-filtering courses, and we are adding modules
covering mail and Web serving. Courses on Linux telephony and security issues
will be available soon.
</p><p>
Without profit as our prime motive, we're not bound to train using
traditional methods or business models. We can explore new
technologies and teaching methods.
Right now we're working on a model for training whole IT departments
called Immersion Training. We have a lot of experience training in
corporate environments, and we think the most efficient way to do that
is to drop a training team into a company to merge with an IT team and lead
it through the design and implementation of new infrastructure,
hands-on. When we get there, the team has no infrastructure or training,
but when we leave, it has a basic infrastructure and a
completely trained and supported staff, with complete documentation of
an entire modular, testable process.
</p><p>
Another thing we've been thinking about is how to get corporate
trainers to develop and use open courseware. We think corporate
trainers should be hired to customize and teach open courseware for
their corporate clients. Open courseware is a great marketing tool for
trainers, and more trainers should do
it. There really is no financial downside for technical trainers if
they know how to market their courseware. But we're not simply
discussing the economics of new training models that use open
courseware, we're proving them viable.
