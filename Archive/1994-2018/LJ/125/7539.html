Economize on hard drive usage and extend your laptop's battery life.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b4348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Laptops give you the freedom to do whatever you want,
wherever you want to do it. But when your battery runs out, the fun is
over. Fortunately, there are a lot of ways to save power and make
your battery last longer. For instance, you can lower the processor
speed, dim the display's backlight and spin down the hard drive. The
first two tricks work well on Linux, but until recently, spinning
down the hard drive could be quite a struggle. Even if you could get
the drive to spin down, it never would stay down long enough to
save any power. This article explains how you can use Laptop Mode,
a feature recently added to the Linux kernel, to spin down the
drive for real. I talk only about Linux 2.6 here; a Laptop Mode is
available in 2.4, but it is a bit different.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b4450"></a>
Hard Drives and Battery Life</h2></div></div><p>
Let's do a little math to find out how much extra battery life you can
get by spinning down the hard drive. A typical laptop on the market
today has a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 50&ndash;100
Watt-hours of power, which is good for two to four hours. Say we have
a laptop with a battery of 50 Watt-hours. If the battery lasts for 3.5
hours with the hard drive on, then we can calculate the average power
usage as 50/3.5 = 14.3 Watts. Say the laptop uses a typical laptop hard
drive, which uses about 0.9 Watts in idle mode and about 0.3 Watts in
standby. In theory we can reduce the power usage by 0.6 Watts, to
about 13.7 Watts. This increases battery life to 50/13.7 = 3 hours and
39 minutes. The gain always depends on how much power you save relative
to the total power usage. In our example, the spindown saves about 4% of
the total power, so the maximum gain in battery life is about 4% as well.
</p><p>
So much for theory, I want to show you some real data. I borrowed a
friend's Apple PowerBook G4, installed Debian GNU/Linux and the Linux
2.6.6 kernel and then did some experiments. I wanted to estimate
the maximum gain in battery life and the time we needed between
spinups to come close to that maximum. I expected a pretty large gain,
because the laptop was equipped with a power-hungry 5,400 rpm drive and
because I stripped the system of the X server and all d&aelig;mons. I wrote
a benchmark program that always performs the same amount of disk I/O per
hour, but with a configurable inactive period between I/O bursts. During
inactive periods, the benchmark program spins down the hard drive. I
ran the benchmark with a number of inactive period lengths, and I used
the APM battery information to calculate the expected battery life.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7539f1.large.jpg"><img src="7539f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Results of the Battery Life Experiment
</p></div></div><p>
I've run this experiment with the disk spun up all the time and with
burst intervals ranging from 12 seconds to ten minutes.
The results are illustrated in Figure 1. As you can see, as soon as you do
I/O less than once every 30 seconds, you have pretty much saved
all you can. This seems strange, because spinning up the disk
costs a lot of power, right? No, actually, it doesn't. If the drive can
spin up in two seconds, that takes about as much power as keeping
it running idle for, say, eight seconds. So if you can spin that drive
down for nine seconds, you've already saved some power. The 30-second
burst interval already leaves room for a pretty long spindown,
which is why it shows such good benchmark results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b4870"></a>
Laptop Mode</h2></div></div><p>
Laptop Mode is a setting for the Linux kernel that changes how the kernel
distributes disk I/O over time. Linux normally does disk I/O in small
amounts, nicely spread out over time. But with all that I/O going on,
your hard drive never gets a chance to spin down, wasting
valuable power. For a laptop, disk activity must be concentrated into
short stretches of time, with periods of inactivity between them, like I
did with the benchmark. When you enable Laptop Mode, Linux does exactly
that. You can get stretches of up to ten minutes without disk activity,
which definitely improves your laptop's battery life.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b49d0"></a>
How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a look at what Laptop Mode does to get that kind of I/O
behaviour. To create periods without disk activity, we need to do as
much as we can during the active periods. After that, we need to
hold off disk I/O for as long as possible. During active periods, we do a
couple of extra things. First, we perform some read-ahead; if that
data actually is needed during the inactive period, we've saved a
spinup. Laptop Mode sets the read-ahead to 4MB by default. Second, we
sync everything to disk at the end of every active
period. This keeps your data safe; when the drive has spun down, you can
be sure that everything done up to the spindown is stored safely.
</p><p>
During an inactive period, writes are the only kind of disk I/O we
can hold off. We can keep the unwritten data in memory for as long as
we like or until we're out of memory. Unfortunately, this was not so
easy for us to implement, because Linux submits write requests from
many places. We needed to tweak all those places
to hold off their writes.
</p><p>
The first and most important tweak has to do with modified or dirty
data. Normally, when a cached disk page has been modified more than 30
seconds ago, it expires, and the pdflush d&aelig;mon writes it to
disk. Fortunately, the expiry interval is configurable through
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs. Laptop Mode sets it to
ten minutes so that changes stay in memory for up to ten minutes
before they're written to disk. Because every active period is ended
with a sync, the inactive period starts without any dirty pages.
Therefore, during the first ten minutes of an inactive period, we can be
sure that no pages are written back because they expire.
</p><p>
The second tweak concerns journaling filesystems, which do a lot of
disk I/O themselves. On most of the journaling filesystems supported
by Laptop Mode, a change to the filesystem triggers a write operation
within five seconds. For instance, in the ext3 filesystem, a filesystem
transaction has a maximum lifetime before it is automatically committed,
and committing means writing to disk. This maximum lifetime can be
configured using the commit mount option. By remounting the filesystem
with this option set to ten minutes, we stop ext3 from committing
transactions during an inactive period. Again, we start every inactive
period with a sync, so no transactions are open when the
inactive period starts. Laptop Mode extends a similar treatment to the
other supported filesystems, ReiserFS and XFS.
</p><p>
The final tweak occurs in Linux's memory management. If a lot of memory is
allocated during an inactive period, the memory manager eventually
has to select some memory pages that need to be dropped. It is possible
to select a page that needs to be written to disk before it
can be dropped, for instance a modified disk page or a page that needs
to be written to swap space. But then, it has to spin up the drive
to perform that write, and we don't want that to happen. Andrew Morton
tweaked the memory manager so that when we're running in Laptop Mode, the memory
manager first tries to select pages that don't require a write.
</p><p>
Using these tweaks, Laptop Mode can create up to ten minutes without
disk activity. When you're not changing any files at all, you can get
even longer periods without spinning up the disk. After all, if there's
nothing to write, there's no reason to spin up the disk. Unfortunately,
when you've mounted the filesystems with the default options,
things change by themselves; the filesystem records access times. Access times are updated even when you're only reading files,
and they must be written to disk eventually. To avoid this problem, Laptop
Mode remounts all filesystems with the noatime mount option. This
makes them stop recording access times, so you actually can get
more than ten minutes of time without disk I/O.
</p><p>
As you might have noticed, we're doing some things typically done
from user space, such as tweaking /proc. In fact, we've
split Laptop Mode into a kernel component and a user-space script. You can
use the script to enable laptop mode, and it enables the kernel support
by setting /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode. It then remounts
your filesystems and tweaks some other settings in /proc
as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b4ce8"></a>
Setting It Up</h2></div></div><p>
To set up Laptop Mode on your system, first make sure you have a kernel
version that supports it. Laptop Mode is included in Linux 2.6 from
version 2.6.6 upward. In the kernel source tree, you can find the
documentation for Laptop Mode in Documentation/laptop-mode.txt. Embedded in the documentation is the control script,
which you have to extract and save as /sbin/laptop_mode. Give the script
execute permissions: <tt  >chmod 700
/sbin/laptop_mode</tt>.
</p><p>
To enable Laptop Mode, run (as root) <tt  >/sbin/laptop_mode
start</tt>. This does everything necessary, except it doesn't
make your hard drive spin down. To do that, you must set the hard drive's
idle timeout using <tt  >hdparm -S 4 /dev/hda</tt>. The value
4 indicates an idle timeout of 20 seconds. If you want to disable Laptop
Mode, simply run <tt  >/sbin/laptop_mode stop</tt>.
</p><p>
You probably want to configure Laptop Mode so it starts whenever
your laptop runs on batteries. If you have a laptop that supports ACPI,
you can set this up like so: extract the files ac_adapter
and battery.sh from the Laptop Mode
documentation and install them in the indicated locations. Edit
battery.sh to configure your hard drive's device name and
your preferred idle timeout, and you're ready to roll.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b5000"></a>
Spinup Debugging</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes your drive spins up for reasons you don't understand. When this
occurs,
it's time to start debugging. Laptop Mode includes a mode for debugging
disk activity, block dump mode. Before you enable it, you
first must stop syslogd from logging kernel messages or stop
it completely. How this is done depends on your distribution. If you don't
stop syslogd, you may put your machine in an endless loop; the debug
output is picked up by syslogd, which writes it to disk, causing
more debug output and so forth.
</p><p>
To enable block dump mode, run (as root) <tt  >echo 1 &gt;
/proc/sys/vm/block_dump</tt>. The kernel output, which you now have
to read using <tt  >dmesg</tt> because syslogd is inactive,
should show messages such as these:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash(273): READ block 3242 on hda1
bash(273): dirtied inode 10237 (.bash_history) on hda1
pdflush(6): WRITE block 3242 on hda1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b5268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You can read this output as follows. A process named bash, with process
ID 273, has read the block with number 3242 on device
/dev/hda1. That same process then dirtied a file
called .bash_history; the file was changed, but the changes weren't
written to disk yet. The pdflush d&aelig;mon then wrote block 3242,
which most probably is the block that bash modified earlier.
</p><p>
When you've got the debug output, it's time to diagnose your problem. If
you're seeing a READ message somewhere, you don't have to look
further. Find out why the process needs to read this data
and decide whether you want to stop the process, change the application's
settings so that it doesn't need that data anymore or perhaps read
the data ahead when the drive is spun up. Reading a file ahead
is no more difficult than doing <tt  >cat /my/file
&gt;/dev/null</tt>, preferably twice, so Linux's read-once logic does not throw the
file right out again. Now, if you're seeing only dirtied file messages,
there's not much to worry about. Nobody is writing anything to disk;
these messages tell you only that a process is making changes that need
to be written eventually. If you get these, your disk spins up once
every ten minutes to write back the modifications, and that's it.
</p><p>
If you're seeing WRITE messages more often than once every ten minutes,
and you're not seeing any READs that could have triggered an active
period, there's a good chance that some process is
syncing a file explicitly. syslogd is notorious for doing this. If you see syslogd
writing at unexpected times, you should adjust your
syslog.conf. It probably contains lines like this one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kern.*    /var/log/kern.log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b54d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This line tells syslogd to call fsync() after every log message matching
kern.*. If you change the line to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kern.*    -/var/log/kern.log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24bc580.0x25b5630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and restart syslog, syslog no longer calls fsync() on these log
messages. Be careful for which log files you make this change,
though. For
instance, if you care about security, you probably want to keep
auth.log synchronized.

Tips and Tricks</b></p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MP3 Playing</b></span>
</p><p>
If you want to play MP3s with your drive
suspended, you can try increasing the READAHEAD setting in
/sbin/laptop_mode. Alternatively, you can copy a whole set
of MP3s to a small tmpfs RAM disk. Make sure you don't make the
RAM disk so big that it gets pushed out to swap space or you defeat the
purpose. A small RAM disk is good for anything for which you don't want disk
activity to occur&mdash;but only if your data isn't important.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Custom Spindown Times</b></span>
</p><p>
It's possible to adjust
Laptop Mode's maximum spindown time. To do that, set variable MAX_AGE
in /sbin/laptop_mode to the maximum number of
seconds you want your data to remain in memory without being saved
to disk. By default, it is set to 600 seconds or ten minutes. It really doesn't
pay to increase the setting to a higher number, as you can see from
the benchmark results that I got on the PowerBook. You can set it to a
lower value if you care more about your data and less about
those extra two minutes. And if you want to prevent losing some really
important data that you've just saved, you simply can execute
<tt  >sync</tt>. Laptop Mode respects your sync requests, so this
actually writes everything to disk, as it normally would. The sync
also resets all timeouts, so that after the sync the disk can stay spun
down for up to ten minutes again.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Spinning Down with cpudyn</b></span>
</p><p>
If you are using cpudyn
to control your CPU frequency dynamically, you might be interested to
know that it also can spin down your hard drive. I have seen some drives
that simply ignore their idle timeout setting if it's too low for their
taste. Also, idle timeout settings are done in five-second increments,
which means that you can't set it to something like eight seconds. cpudyn
comes in handy, because it doesn't rely on your hard drive to detect
idle periods, and it can spin it down whenever you want.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Smart Spindown</b></span>
</p><p>
Laptop Mode performs a sync at the
end of an active period and then waits for the disk to spin down on
its own. It's even better to sync just before the drive spins down,
because then you save data that is up to 20 seconds
more recent. Laptop Mode can't do this, because it can't spin
down the drive actively. I have written a script to do this called Smart
Spindown, which works together with Laptop Mode. It's an unpolished piece
of script, but if you really want to save every bit of power there is or
if you want to keep 20 extra seconds of data safe, this might be for you;
see the on-line Resources section.
