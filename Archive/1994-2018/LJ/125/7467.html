Explosive is perhaps the best term to describe the growth of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) market in recent years. Contributing factors
are numerous, and perhaps the most dramatic are economic: access to GPS
is absolutely free and the cost of hardware continues to plummet. As a
result, the GPS user can choose from a variety of devices that provide a
position estimate. GPS has long been used, however, to explore topics beyond
positioning; space weather, precise timing and continental drift are but
three examples.
</p><p>
In order to use GPS for advanced topics or simply for
improved positioning, the raw observations collected by the GPS receiver
must be processed. In the past, the nuts and bolts of such processing
have been left up to proprietary software. Now, a project called the GPS
Toolkit, or GPSTk, is available under the LGPL to the Open Source and
research communities. GPSTk is the by-product of GPS research conducted
at the Applied Research Laboratories of the University of Texas at Austin
(ARL:UT) since before the first satellite launched in 1978. It is the
combined effort of many software engineers and scientists. Recently, the
research staff at ARL:UT has decided to open source much of their basic
GPS processing software as the GPSTk.

The Global Positioning System</h2></div></div><p>
The Global Positioning System actually is a US government satellite
navigation system that provides a civilian signal. As of this writing,
the signal is broadcast simultaneously by a constellation of 29
satellites,
each with a 12-hour orbit. From any given position on the Earth, 8&ndash;12 satellites usually are visible at a time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7467f1.large.jpg"><img src="7467f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

GPS in a Nutshell</h2></div></div><p>
Each satellite broadcasts spread spectrum signals at 1,575.42 and
1,227.6MHz, also known as L1 and L2, respectively. Currently, the civil signal
is broadcast only on L1. The signal contains two components, a time
code and a navigation message. By differencing the received time code
with an internal time code, the receiver can determine the distance, or
range, that the signal has traveled. This range observation is offset
by errors in the (imperfect) receiver clock; therefore, it is called a
pseudorange. The navigation message contains the satellite ephemeris,
which is a numerical model of the satellite's orbit.
</p><p>
GPS receivers record, besides the pseudorange, a measurement called the
carrier phase, or phase. The phase also is a range observation like the
pseudorange is, except it has an unknown constant added to it, the
phase ambiguity. It also is much smoother, having about 100 times less
measurement noise than the pseudorange, which makes it useful for
precise positioning. Because of the way it is measured, the phase is
subject to random, sudden jumps. These discrete changes always come in
multiples of the wavelength of the GPS signal and are called cycle slips.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288cad8"></a>
The Position Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The standard solution for the user location requires a pseudorange
measurement and an ephemeris for each satellite in view. At least four
measurements are required, as there are four unknowns: three coordinates of
position plus the receiver clock offset. The basic algorithm for the
solution is described in the official GPS Interface Control Document,
ICD-GPS-200. The position solution is corrupted due to two sources
of error, errors in the observations and errors in the ephemeris.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288cbe0"></a>
Reducing Measurement Errors</h2></div></div><p>
The GPS signal travels through every layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Each
layer affects the signal differently. The ionosphere, which is the
high-altitude, electrically charged part of the atmosphere, introduces
a delay, and therefore a range error, into the signal. The delay is
frequency-dependent, so it can be computed directly if you have data on
both the GPS frequencies. There also is a delay due to the troposphere,
the lower part of the atmosphere. This delay also can be modeled and
removed. Many other errors are associated with the GPS signal.
Multipath reflections and relativistic effects are two examples.
</p><p>
More precise applications reduce the effect of error sources by a
technique referred to as differential GPS (DGPS). By differencing
measurements simultaneously collected by the user and a nearby reference
receiver, the errors common to both receivers (most of them)
are removed. The result of DGPS positioning is a position relative to the
reference receiver; adding the reference position to the DGPS solution
results in the absolute user position.
</p><p>
The alternative to DGPS is to model and remove errors explicitly. Creating
new and robust models of phenomena that affect the GPS signal is an area
of active research at ARL:UT and other laboratories. The positioning
algorithm can be used to explore such models. Essentially, the basic
approach is to turn the positioning algorithm inside out to look at
the corrections themselves. For example, observations from a network of
receivers can create a global map or model of the ionosphere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288cd98"></a>
Improved Ephemerides</h2></div></div><p>
The GPS position solution can be improved by using a better
satellite ephemeris. The US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
generates and makes publicly available a number of precise ephemerides,
which are more accurate satellite orbits. Satellite orbits described by
the broadcast navigation message have an error on the order of meters, and
the precise ephemeris has decimeter accuracy. The International GPS
Service (IGS) is a global civil cooperative effort that also provides free
precise ephemeris products. Global networks of tracking stations produce
the observations that make generation of the precise ephemerides possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288cea0"></a>
GPS Data Sources</h2></div></div><p>
GPS observation data from many tracking stations are available
freely on the Internet. Many such stations contribute their data to the
IGS. In addition, many networks of stations also post their data to
the Internet, such as the Australian Regional GPS Network (ARGN)
and global cooperatives including NASA's Crust Dynamics Data Information
System (CDIS).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288cfa8"></a>
GPS File Formats</h2></div></div><p>
Typically, GPS observations are recorded
in a standardized format developed by and for researchers. Fundamental
to this format is the idea that the data should be independent of the
type of receiver that collected it. For this reason, the format is called
receiver independent exchange, or RINEX. Another format associated with
GPS is SP-3, which records the precise ephemeris. The GPSTk supports
both RINEX and SP-3 formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288d0b0"></a>
GPS Receivers and Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
GPS receivers have become less expensive and more capable over the
years, in particular handheld and mobile GPS receivers. The receivers
have many features in common. All of the receivers output a position
solution every few seconds. All receivers store a list of positions,
called waypoints. Many can display maps that can be uploaded. Many
can communicate with a PC or handheld to store information or provide
position estimates to plotting software.
</p><p>
Typically, communication with a PC and other system follows a standard
provided by the National Marine Electronics Association, called
NMEA-0183. NMEA-0183 defines an ASCII-based format for communication of
position solutions, waypoints and a variety of receiver diagnostics. Here
is an example of a line of NMEA data, or sentence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$GPGLL,5133.81,N,00042.25,W*75
</pre>
</p><p>
The data here is a latitude, longitude fix at 51&deg; 33.81 min North,
0&deg; 42.25 min West. The last part is a checksum.
</p><p>
As a public standard, the NMEA-0183 format has given the user of GPS
freedom of choice. NMEA-0183 is the format most typically used by open-source applications that use receiver-generated positions.
</p><p>
Closed standards also are common. SiRF is a proprietary protocol
licensed to receiver manufacturers. Many receiver manufacturers implement
their own binary protocols. Although some of these protocols have been
opened to the public, some have been reverse engineered. GPSBabel is an
open-source project to communicate with consumer-grade receivers. The
Sharc Project is a similar project to provide communication with survey-grade receivers.
</p><p>
A number of interesting open-source applications are available that
utilize consumer-grade receivers. With one, you can use open-source applications to
navigate in your car. The GPS Drive Project helps you do that, using a
graphical map. GPS Drive also can be linked to the Festival application to
get driving directions in the form of speech output. Internet sites such
as WiGLE.net have lists of the geographic coordinates of open wireless
LANs; you can use your GPS unit to find these.
</p><p>
Traditionally, DGPS is accomplished with two or more receivers that
communicate position information with radio waves. You can do DGPS over
IP now, using open-source applications. The open-source project called
gpsd essentially broadcasts NMEA-0183 sentences over TCP/IP. The gps3d
Project, which allows you to visualize your position and the configuration
of GPS in 3-D, also can utilize a gps3d server.
</p><p>
All of these applications are based on standard positioning. To move your
positioning capability to the next level, you have to work directly with
the observations made by the receiver. Only a few open-source or
freely available programs exist that give the user this freedom. OpenSourceGPS
is a project to create a GPS receiver based on the Zarlink chipset.
teqc from UNAVCO performs quality assurance and processes
raw data from receivers to generate RINEX, but it is closed source. In
contrast, the purpose of the GPSTk is to give the user the ability to
manipulate not only GPS observations but also to improve the
processing algorithms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288d4d0"></a>
The GPS Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
The GPS Toolkit (GPSTk) is coded entirely in ANSI C++. It is platform-independent and has been built and tested on Linux, Solaris and Microsoft
Windows. Everything needed to write standalone, console-based programs
is included, along with several complete applications.
</p><p>
The design is highly object-oriented. Everything is contained in the
namespace gpstk::. For example, reading and writing a RINEX observation
file is as simple as this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

// open, read and re-write a RINEX file
using namespace gpstk;
// input file stream
RinexObsStream rin(inputfile);
// output file stream
RinexObsStream rout(outputfile,
ios::out|ios::trunc);
DayTime nextTime; //Date/time object
RinexObsHeader head; //RINEX header object
RinexObsData data; //RINEX data object

// read the RINEX header
rin &gt;&gt; head;
rout.header = rin.header;
rout &lt;&lt; rout.header;

// loop over all data epochs
while (rin &gt;&gt; data) {
nextTime = data.time;
// change obs data&amp;
rout &lt;&lt; data;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The core capability of the library is built around RINEX file I/O. It
also includes a complete date and time class to manipulate time tags
in GPS and many other formats.
</p><p>
In addition to the RINEX I/O, GPSTk includes classes for handling
geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and GPS ephemeris
computations. There also is a complete template-based Matrix and
Vector package. And, of course, there are GPS positioning and navigation
algorithms, including several tropospheric models.
</p><p>
Finally, several standalone programs are included in the
distribution. Included are utilities to validate or modify RINEX files,
a summary program, a utility to remove or modify observations, a phase
discontinuity corrector and a program to compute standard errors and
corrections, such as the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere
along the signal path.

Getting Started with the GPS Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
The GPS Toolkit is available for download as a tarball (see the on-line
Resources section). To build the toolkit
you need to use jam, a replacement for make, and Doxygen, a source
code documentation generator. The entire build sequence looks like
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf gpstk-1.0.tar.gz
cd gpstk
jam
doxygen
su
jam -sPREFIX=/usr install
</pre>
</p><p>
This sequence builds and installs the GPSTk dynamic and shared
libraries, as well as the header files, in the /usr tree. In addition,
a doc subdirectory is created, containing HTML-based documentation of the
GPSTk library.
</p><p>
Below are three example applications of the GPSTk created at ARL:UT. The
second example actually is distributed as an application with the GPSTk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x288d9a0"></a>
Enhanced Positioning</h2></div></div><p>
Position solutions generated by the GPSTk provide improved precision and
robustness compared to those generated by a GPS receiver.
Figure 2 illustrates the benefits; each axis extends from &ndash;10 to 10
meters.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7467f2.large.jpg"><img src="7467f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Left: positions from a GPS receiver. Right: positions
generated using GPSTk algorithms.
</p></div></div><p>
Plot A shows position computations and how they vary along the East and
North directions. Such results are representative of solutions created
with a consumer-grade GPS receiver. Plot B shows how the position estimate
improves when atmospheric delays are accounted for. Direct processing not
only improves precision, but it also increases robustness. Plot C shows
the effect of a faulty satellite. The faulty satellite is detected and
removed using the GPSTk in Plot D.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2794580.0x28845a0"></a>
Carrier-Phase Discontinuity Correction</h2></div></div><p>
An important problem in GPS data processing involves discontinuities in
the carrier phase. Before phase data can be used, cycle slips must be
found and fixed. The GPSTk distribution includes an application called
a discontinuity corrector that does just that. This feature is available
in the library as well.
</p><p>
The GPSTk discontinuity corrector works by forming two useful linear
combinations of the dual-frequency phase data, called the wide-lane
phase bias and the geometry-free phase. An example of these for normal
data is shown in Figure 3. The wide-lane bias (red) is noisy but has a constant
average. The geometry-free phase does not depend on the receiver-satellite
geometry, but it depends strongly on the ionospheric delay. In
fact, it is proportional to that delay. Normally, the ionosphere is
quiet and smooth, but at times it can be active and rough; then
this quantity can vary wildly. The geometry-free phase and
the wide-lane noise increase at both ends of the dataset, because the
satellite is rising or setting there. Consequently, the signal must
travel through more atmosphere.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7467f3.large.jpg"><img src="7467f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Slip detected (blue circle) in the wide-lane data (green) where
test quantity (dark blue) is larger than limit (magenta).
</p></div></div><p>
The discontinuity corrector works by first looking for slips in the
wide-lane phase bias; Figure 4 illustrates a case in which it found one. When a slip
in the wide-lane slip is found, the code turns to the geometry-free
phase and looks for the slip there. To estimate the size of the slip,
low-order polynomials are fit to the data on each side of the slip, extrapolated to the point where the slip occurred and
then differenced.

Satellite Position Interpolation</h2></div></div><p>
Another GPSTk application at ARL:UT involves a satellite in low-earth
orbit that carries a GPS receiver. This satellite collects GPS data
both for the satellites above it, referred to as top-side data, and
those visible below it, or bottom-side data. The GPS signal for the
bottom-side data has a long path length through the atmosphere, which
is ideal for remote sensing of the atmosphere. The top-side data is used
for computing the LEO satellite's rapidly changing position as it orbits
Earth. A problem arises here as the top-side data is collected with a
lower data rate (10 seconds) than on the bottom-side (1 second), yet the
position of the LEO satellite is needed for processing the bottom-side
data at the higher data rate. To solve the problem, a program was written,
using only GPSTk, which reads the GPS data, computes the LEO position
with the top-side data and then interpolates those positions to
1-second epochs. The result is shown in Figure 6, a plot of the position of
the LEO satellite as it orbits Earth.

The Future of GPSTk</h2></div></div><p>
Open-source GPS processing, on the scale anticipated for the GPS
Toolkit, is unprecedented; we are excited by the prospect of what could
develop. GPSTk potentially has a broad range of audiences. Universities
can use the GPSTk to process GPS data with open-source code. Embedded
developers can develop software to perform GPS positioning and to read,
write and edit RINEX data files. Researchers may find that this code is
an excellent foundation for GPS receivers implemented entirely in software,
called software receivers.
</p><p>
Although the growth of the GPSTk will depend strongly on user feedback and
participation, changes also will be driven by shifts in the satellite
navigation arena. In the near term, the first satellite to provide
dual-frequency pseudoranges to civilians is scheduled for launch in
2005. Furthermore, the European community is creating Galileo, which
will provide a public-regulated service compatible with GPS,
essentially augmenting the current constellation with a new one. In
the long term, GPS will have new signals in the L5 and M code. GPSTk,
with its emphasis on fundamental observations, can provide the basis to
explore and exploit these changes.
</p><p>
It is our hope that university students, laboratory researchers, system
engineers and software developers will contribute to, as well as benefit
from, the GPS Toolkit. We already have seen many benefits to using this
code within our lab and believe that the GPSTk will inspire a number
of innovative GPS applications.
