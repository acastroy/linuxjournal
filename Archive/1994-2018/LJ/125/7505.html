My article &ldquo;GNU Radio: Tools for Exploring the Radio Frequency
Spectrum&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, June 2004] provides an
overview of how the GNU Radio system
works and discusses a couple hardware options for
getting the RF signals digitized and into the computer. This article
takes a look at how to use GNU Radio to listen to FM radio.
</p><p>
The hardware setup used in this article is shown in Figure 1. It's the
brute-force, no-frills approach and is good for explaining how
everything works. Later in the article, we discuss the Universal
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and what it can do for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7505f1.large.jpg"><img src="7505f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Cable Modem Tuner RF Front End
</p></div></div><p>
Our setup consists of a conventional FM dipole
antenna, a cable modem tuner module mounted on
an evaluation board and a 20M sample/second PCI
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) card.
The antenna plugs
in to the input of the tuner module. The tuner
module IF output is connected with a piece of coaxial
cable to the ADC input on the back of the computer.
The tuner module eval board is connected to the PC's
parallel port so that we have a way of controlling
the module.
</p><p>
The specific hardware we're using is a Microtune 4937 DI5 3X7702 cable
modem tuner module and a Measurement Computing PCI-DAS 4020/12 ADC
board. This particular tuner module is hard to get, but others, such
as those from Sharp Microelectronics, ought to work fine (see the on-line
Resources section).
</p><p>
The cable modem tuner functions as our RF front end and is responsible
for translating the radio frequency signals that we're interested in
down to a range that our ADC can deal with. In this case, the module
translates a selectable 6MHz chunk of the spectrum in the range of
50MHz&ndash;800MHz down to a 6MHz chunk centered at 5.75MHz. For more
background on these concepts, see the June article mentioned previously.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x198a7c0"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
First off, let's take a look at what happens when we tune our front end
to the middle of the FM band, say 100.1MHz. Figure 2 shows the
received samples vs. time. This view, the time domain, is what you'd
see on an oscilloscope. It's not particularly enlightening, but it
does show that our samples are in the range of &ndash;170 to &ndash;70, which is
fine. In an ideal world, they would be symmetric about zero. For our
purposes, the offset won't matter.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7505f2.large.jpg"><img src="7505f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. ADC Samples in the Time Domain
</p></div></div><p>
The frequency domain provides additional information. In this case, we
grab 1,024 samples at a time and compute the discrete Fourier transform
using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. This gives us a representation of the
frequencies that are contained in the input signal. Figure 3 shows
the resulting spectrum. The x-axis is frequency, and the y-axis is
power in decibels (10 * log<sub  >10</sub> power). The low end is at
zero Hz, and the top end is at 10MHz, half our sampling rate.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7505f3.large.jpg"><img src="7505f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Fast Fourier Transform of FM Band with Nine Stations
</p></div></div><p>
Each of the spikes in Figure 3 is a radio station. Our software sees
them all at once! To listen to a station, we need a way to separate it
from all of the others, translate it to baseband (DC, 0Hz) and
reverse the effect of the frequency modulation. We work through
this step by step, but first let's talk about FM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x198ad40"></a>
What Is Frequency Modulation?</h2></div></div><p>
To understand how an FM receiver works, it's helpful to know a bit
about how FM signals are generated. With FM, the instantaneous
frequency of the transmitted waveform is varied as a function of the
input signal. Figure 4 shows m(t), the input signal (the message,
music and so forth), and s(t), the resulting modulated output. To be
rigorous, the instantaneous frequency at any time is given by the
following formula:
</p><p>
f(t) = k*m(t) + f<sub  >c</sub>
</p><p>
m(t) is the input signal, k is a constant that controls the
frequency sensitivity and f<sub  >c</sub> is the frequency of the carrier
(for example, 100.1MHz). Remember that frequency has units of radians per
second. As a result, frequency can be thought of as the rate at which
something is rotating. If we integrate frequency, we get phase, or
angle. Conversely, differentiating phase with respect to time gives
frequency. These are the key insights we use to build the receiver.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7505f4.large.jpg"><img src="7505f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. A Simple Frequency Modulated Signal
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x198b160"></a>
The Block Diagram</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 5 shows our strategy for listening to an FM station. If
we remove the carrier, we're left with a baseband signal that has an
instantaneous frequency proportional to the original message m(t).
Thus, our challenge is to find a way to remove the carrier and compute
the instantaneous frequency.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7505f5.large.jpg"><img src="7505f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Block Diagram of FM Receiver
</p></div></div><p>
The first part is easy. We get rid of the carrier by using our
software digital downconverter (DDC) block,
freq_xlating_fir_filter_scf. This block is composed conceptually of a
numerically controlled oscillator that generates sine and cosine
waveforms at the frequency that we want to translate to zero, a mixer
(that's a multiplier to us software folks) and a decimating finite impulse
response filter. The scf suffix indicates that this block takes a
stream of shorts on its input, produces a stream of complexes on its
output and uses floating-point taps to specify the filter.
</p><p>
The digital downconverter does its job by taking advantage of a
trigonometric identity that says when you multiply two sinusoids of
frequency f<sub  >1</sub> and f<sub  >2</sub>
together, the result is composed of two
new sinusoids, one at f<sub  >1</sub>+f<sub  >2</sub> and the other at
f<sub  >1</sub>&ndash;f<sub  >2</sub>. In our case, we multiply the incoming signal by the
frequency of the carrier. The output consists of two components, one
at 2x the carrier and one at zero. We get rid of the 2x component
with a low-pass filter, leaving us the baseband signal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x198b6e0"></a>
MIPS Are Us!</h2></div></div><p>
A straightforward implementation of the digital downconverter block
in software is extremely expensive computationally. We'd be
performing the sine and cosine generation and multiplication at the
full input rate. On a Pentium 4, computing sine and cosine takes on the
order of 150 cycles. Given a 20M sample/sec input stream, we'd be
burning up 20e6 * 150 = 3e9 cycles/sec merely computing sine and cosine!
Definitely a non-starter.
</p><p>
The good news is there's a better way to implement
the DDC in software. This technique, described by
Vanu Bose, et al., in &ldquo;Virtual Radios&rdquo; (see Resources), allows us to
run all of the computation at the decimated rate by
rearranging the order of the operations and using
frequency-specific complex filter coefficients instead
of real coefficients. The end result is a big win!
We can do it in real time!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x198b898"></a>
Quadrature Demodulation</h2></div></div><p>
The next job is to compute the instantaneous frequency of the baseband
signal. We use the quadrature_demod_cf block for this. We
approximate differentiating the phase by determining the angle between
adjacent samples. Recall that the downconverter block produces
complex numbers on its output. Using a bit more trigonometry, we can
determine the angle between two subsequent samples by multiplying one
by the complex conjugate of the other and then taking the arc tangent
of the product. Listings 1 and 2 show the implementation of the
quadrature_demod_cf block. Once you know what you want, it doesn't
take much code. The bulk of the signal processing is the three-line
loop in sync_work.

Tying this all together, Figure 6 shows the output of the digital
downconverter, and Figure 7 shows the output of the quadrature
demodulator. In Figure 7, you can see all the components of the FM
waveform. From 0 to about 16kHz is the left plus right (L+R) audio.
The peak at 19kHz is the stereo pilot tone. The left minus right
(L-R) stereo information is centered at 2x the pilot (38kHz) and is AM-modulated on top of the FM. Additional subcarriers are sometimes
found in the region of 57kHz&ndash;96kHz.

</p></div></div><p>
To keep life simple, we low pass the output of the quadrature
demodulator with a cutoff frequency of 16kHz. This gives us a
monaural output that we connect to the sound card outputs.

A Multichannel Receiver</h2></div></div><p>
Listing 3, available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
FTP site (see Resources), is the Python code that implements the
overall receiver. In fact, it can listen to two FM
stations at the same time, one out the left speaker
and one out the right! I'm not arguing that this
is a particularly practical application, but it
does illustrate some of the power of software radio.
This idea of extracting multiple stations concurrently
could be used as the basis of a multichannel
TiVo-like device for radio.
</p><p>
The code is split into three functions. main handles the argument
parsing, manages the RF front end and controls the main signal
processing loop. If we're receiving a single station, we tell the RF
front end to put the station right at the center of the tuner's output
frequency, the IF. If we're receiving two stations, we ensure that
they're within 5.5MHz of each other. This restriction is due to the
SAW filter built in to the cable modem tuner. It's a bandpass filter
centered at 5.75MHz that's about 6MHz wide, the width of a North
American TV channel. In this case, we split the difference and tune
the front end exactly halfway between the two stations.
build_graph instantiates the common signal processing blocks and
connects them together. In both the single and dual-station modes, we
use a single high-speed analog-to-digital converter for input and a
single sound card for output. For each station that we want to
receive concurrently, we instantiate a digital downconverter,
quadrature demodulator and low-pass filter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1892580.0x1982c28"></a>
There's More Than One Way to Do It!</h2></div></div><p>
The maximum number of stations that can be
received concurrently is a
function of the speed of your computer.
Even with our fancy
implementation, most of the CPU cycles still are burned in the
freq_xlating_fir_filter blocks. What we've described could be called
the dumb ADC/brute-force method. One way to free up computational
resources is to move the digital downconversion into hardware.
Companies such as Texas Instruments, Intersil and Analog Devices sell
dedicated ASICs that do this. The strategy used in the Universal
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) is to code the digital downconverter
in the Verilog hardware description language and then download the
resulting bitstream over the USB into the FPGA. This gives us a
combined hardware/software system that maximizes flexibility while
still allowing us to off-load some of the more computationally
intensive parts into hardware. For more information on the USRP,
see the GNU Radio Wiki.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
We've walked through a fully functional but stripped-down
multichannel FM receiver. We managed to turn a couple thousand
dollars' worth of hardware into the equivalent of two $5 transistor
radios, and we learned a bunch in the process. For those of you
interested in pursuing FM listening, the GNU Radio code base includes
a substantially higher fidelity FM receiver (hifi_fm.py), along with
all kinds of other goodies.
</p><p>
Right now, a lot of interesting work is being done with GNU Radio.
Some are focusing on mobile ad hoc networking, others on the legacy
amateur radio waveforms, some on software GPS and another group is
working on designing the next-generation ground-to-space amateur
satellite communication system. Although the GNU Radio toolkit is
mostly indifferent to I/O devices, most of these efforts are using or
planning on using the USRP as the interface between the RF world and
the PC.
