Manage your wireless networking settings as you move from
place to place, and keep an eye out for the spot with
the best signal.

No, thank you, Fran&ccedil;ois, I don't need to sit down right now. Yes, I
see that the tables are free. That's because our guests haven't arrived
yet. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Ah, I see. You're wondering why I am wandering around
with this notebook in my hands and not taking a moment to sit down. The
reason is simple, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. I've installed wireless access points
in each wing of the wine cellar so we and our guests can have
wireless access. I'm wandering around with my notebook to check signal
strength. I want to make sure that no matter where our guests make
themselves comfortable, they have access.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home to the finest in
Linux cooking, a superb wine cellar and, now, wireless Internet
access. Please sit and make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, head down
to the wine cellar and bring back the 1998 Eden Valley Riesling from
Australia, <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>!
</p><p>
Before you came in, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I was busy making sure that wireless
access was available in all parts of the restaurant. In the case of a
classic, wired network card, a little light let
you know whether you actually were plugged in to the network. This isn't
always so cut and dry with wireless cards. Factors such as distance, signal
strength and even the location of access points dictate what kind of
service you can expect. That's all fine, if you have that information
at your disposal.
</p><p>
The tools on today's menu offer a variety of approaches to providing
wireless card information, from signal strength to access-point
availability. A number of these applications' authors thank Jean
Tourrilhes for his work on the Linux kernel wireless extensions, so I
take a moment here to thank him as well. As Fran&ccedil;ois pours the wine,
it's time to sample the first item on today's menu.
</p><p>
As I've mentioned in the past, I'm rather fond of
WindowMaker dock apps, those self-contained
programs that take up so little room on the
desktop. Consequently, I have three such apps
for you starting with Jess Mahan's
WmWiFi (Figure 1). This little WindowMaker application
caught my eye partly, I suppose, because it looks a
little like the signal meter on my old cell phone.
When you download it (see the on-line Resources section), you can choose from Debian
packages as well as the source. Building the package
from source requires your old friend, the extract and
build five-step:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf wmwifi-0.4.tar.gz
cd wmwifi-0.4
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
To run it, you can type <tt  >wmwifi</tt> at the command line and leave
it at that, but you may find that it doesn't appear too easily if you
aren't running WindowMaker. Try this command instead, <tt  >wmwifi
-bw</tt>. The -bw, if you are curious, stands for broken
window manager. Never let it be said that Jess Mahan did not have a
sense of humor. Incidentally, the gray background is WmWiFi's default
appearance, but clicking on the dock app turns on the backlight,
which then glows LCD green.
</p><p>
In a similar vein, Carsten Schrmann's wmWAVE
(now maintained by Jens Schrmann) offers a nice
compact signal strength meter for your wireless
card, plus a little bit more. There's also an overall
link quality reading and a reading on the noise
level. Building this app is easy.
Simply extract the tarred and gzipped bundle, type
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >make install</tt>. To run
wmWAVE, execute the binary called wmwave
</p><p>
The third of my WindowMaker apps is Ico Doornekamp's
wmifinfo. Unlike the others, this isn't strictly a wireless
application. Instead, it automatically detects all of your network interfaces
and provides information on each one. With a wireless card, it also
displays a signal strength meter at the bottom of the dock app itself. See
Resources for the
source for wmifinfo.
</p><p>
Once
again, this is an easy build: simply extract, type
<tt  >make</tt>
and <tt  >make install</tt>.
To run it, type the command <tt  >wmifinfo</tt>. If you are fond of the gray
LCD look, use the <tt  >wmifinfo -l</tt> option. To switch
between interfaces, if you have multiple cards, left-click on the dock app. By using the
-i option, you can specify a certain interface with which to start
(<tt  >wmifinfo -i eth0</tt>).

Longtime command-line fans such as myself always are excited about
finding a nongraphical application that does a great job and manages
to do it with style. Jan Morgenstern's wavemon is such an
application. In a single ncurses display, wavemon offers a great deal
of network information, including signal, noise and quality
levels.
The information is displayed in a dynamic bar graph; see Figure 2.
wavemon also includes a histogram
view and onscreen configuration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7623f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. wavemon shows signal and noise levels and more.
</p></div></div><p>
Building wavemon is the classic extract and build
five-step again.
To run wavemon, type <tt  >wavemon</tt> at the command line. When
the display starts up, you should see the summary information screen, which
includes signal levels, TCP statistics, information on mode, encryption,
bitrate, your access point, local network card and more. All of the
functions are controlled with function keys. To switch to the histogram
view, press F2 and then F1 to return to the summary
screen. The configuration screen is accessed by pressing F7. Reminders
about each function key's function are at the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
With the release of KDE 3.2, users of the popular desktop environment will
find a nice new application called KWiFiManager. This application,
written by Stefan Winter, provides signal and quality information like
the programs previously mentioned, but there is much more to KWiFiManager. It also makes
it possible to maintain up to four different configurations. The road
warriors among you who move from office to office should find this one
particularly useful.
</p><p>
KWiFiManager may not be installed by default. The
easiest way to check is either to look in your KDE menu or simply type
<tt  >kwifimanager</tt> to start the program.
</p><p>
When KWiFiManager starts, it displays a basic status window
showing signal strength, connection speed, access point, local IP address
and the frequency of the channel. Depending on the actual strength of
the connection, you see words like TOP, EXCELLENT or
ULTIMATE accompanying the numeric signal strength indicator. You
also see a small icon in your system tray with a numeric and graphical
signal quality indicator. Click File on the menu bar and select
Connection statistics for a graph of signal quality over time
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7623f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. KWiFiManager reports real-time connection information and
graphed statistics over time.
</p></div></div><p>
For those who feel cheated that computers aren't providing all the
lights, beeps and science-fiction noises technology promised,
KWiFiManager has an audible feature to satisfy that craving. A beeping
tone that increases or decreases in pitch with the signal can be turned
on. Click Config on the KWiFiManager menu bar and select Acoustic
Scanning. I warn you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that you may find this
becomes tedious pretty quickly, but it is fun for short periods.
</p><p>
KWiFiManager goes well beyond being a signal strength meter. It can help
simplify your network configurations by providing automatic connections
to the various networks you may encounter. Click Config on the menu bar
and select Configuration Editor. At first, you are asked to enter the
root password and then a somewhat larger window appears.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7623f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Up to four preset wireless configurations are possible.
</p></div></div><p>
Along the top, you see four tabs labeled Config1 through
Config4. Each of these areas allows you to prepare a configuration
based on whatever network you are going to be accessing, whether at
home or on the road. I tell you about these settings in a moment, but
first I want to direct your attention to the bottom of the KWiFiManager
window. There's a check box to allow you to Load preset configuration
on KDE startup. If you check that box, you can select one of your four
configurations as the default. If you generally are in your office when
you start your notebook, you can select that as your default network
setup for whenever you log in.
</p><p>
Now, back to the rest of these settings. The most basic aspect to each of
these configurations is right at the top, the Network name. Each
of the four configurations can have a network name associated with it
that is specified in your access point. If you want KDE to activate
your interface and connect you to whatever network is available, enter
<tt  >ANY</tt> as the network name. Off to the right of that,
you can select the connection speed. I personally leave this set
to Auto.
</p><p>
Right below these settings is a field labeled Execute script on
connect. This can be any kind of a program you want to run,
including a script. Perhaps you'd like to play a tune or have your
system suggest a wine. I want to run custom firewall scripts depending
on where I am and what services I like to make available on the network
in question. Speaking of security, a little further down, you should see
a check box labeled Use cryptography. If you are using a wireless
access point with WEP encryption, make sure this
box is checked. Some new fields appear in the application window
where you can specify and enter your key passphrase information. Click OK
(or Apply if you want to keep making changes) and you are done.
</p><p>
Incidentally, you also can access this configuration dialog through the
KDE control center; the program name is kcontrol. Look under
the control center's Internet menu.
</p><p>
Once again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, closing time has arrived all too quickly,
but <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span> is never too strict with the hours. Enjoy a final glass
of wine and enjoy the
wireless access. Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us
all drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
