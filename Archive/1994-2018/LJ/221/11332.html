<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #221, September 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Apparently, <span   class="bold"><b>CloudLinux</b></span> recently accidentally released a non-GPLed
driver that still used GPL-only kernel symbols, and that claimed to
the kernel to be GPLed code. <span   class="bold"><b>Matthew
Garrett</b></span> noticed this first, and
submitted a patch to cause the kernel to treat the
module as non-GPL automatically and deny it access to the GPL-only symbols.
Because
the violation was so blatant, a number of kernel developers seemed to
favor potentially taking legal action against CloudLinux. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> was particularly dismayed, since the driver in question
used kernel symbols he himself had created for GPL use only.
</p><p>
At one point the CEO of CloudLinux, <span   class="bold"><b>Igor
Seletskiy</b></span>, explained that
this just had been an engineering mistake. They had decided to release
their GPLed driver under a proprietary license, which as the copyright
holders they were allowed to do, but they mistakenly had failed to
update the code to stop using GPL-only symbols. He promised to fix the
problem within the next few weeks and to provide source code to the
binary driver that had caused the fuss.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Jones</b></span> recently asked what the etiquette was for giving his own
personal version numbers to his own customized kernels. Greg
Kroah-Hartman replied that he was free to do whatever he wanted in
that arena without offending anyone. But, Greg suggested that in order
for Chris' users to be able to understand the features and
capabilities of the particular customized kernels, Chris 
probably would be served best by relying on the official version numbers
and just appending his own afterward&mdash;for example, Linux version
3.4-cj2.
</p><p>
Apparently, the number of <span   class="bold"><b>patch submissions</b></span> coming into the Linux
kernel is in the process of exploding at the speed of light, like a
new Big Bang. <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> remarked on this trend and suggested
that the kernel development process might have to be modified to be
able to handle such an E=mc<sup  >2</sup>-esque situation. Greg Kroah-Hartman even
said he thought the increase in patch submissions might be an
intentional denial-of-service attack, designed to interfere with the
ability of the kernel developers to keep developing. Thomas didn't
think this was likely, but he did point out that a number of companies
assessed the performance of their kernel-hacking employees by the
number of patches accepted into the kernel, or the total number of
lines of code going into the tree. He speculated that this type of
performance evaluation, implemented by companies around the world,
might account for the DoS-seeming nature of the situation.
</p><p>
Thomas Gleixner pointed out that there was a problem with kernel code
maintainers who pushed their own agendas too aggressively and ignored
their critics just because they could get away with it. Greg
Kroah-Hartman agreed that this was a tough problem to solve, but he
added that in the past, problem maintainers seemed to go away on their
own after a while. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> said that in
his opinion, maintainers who
seemed to be pushing their own agendas were really just doing
development the way they thought it should be done, which was what a
maintainer should be doing.
</p><p>
But, Alan did agree that maintainers sometimes were lax on the job,
because of having children or illnesses or paid employment in other
fields. He suggested that having co-maintainers for any given area of
code might be a good way to take up some of the slack.
</p><p>
Another idea, from <span   class="bold"><b>Trond Myklebust</b></span>, was to encourage maintainers to
insist on having at least one &ldquo;Reviewed-By&rdquo; tag on each patch
submission coming in, so that anyone sending in a patch would be sure
to run it by at least one other person first. That, he said, could
have the effect of reducing the number of bad patches coming in and
easing the load on some of the maintainers.

<h2 class="title">Extreme Graphics with Extrema</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #221, September 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
High-energy physics experiments tend to generate huge amounts of
data. While this data is passed through analysis software, very often
the first thing you may want to do is to graph it and see what it
actually looks like. To this end, a powerful graphing and plotting program
is an absolute must. One available package is called Extrema
(<a href="http://exsitewebware.com/extrema/index.html" target="_self">exsitewebware.com/extrema/index.html</a>). Extrema
evolved from an earlier software package named Physica. Physica
was developed at the TRIUMF high-energy centre in British Columbia,
Canada. It has both a complete graphical interface for interactive use
in data analysis and a command language that allows you to process larger
data sets or repetitive tasks in a batch fashion.
</p><p>
Installing Extrema typically is simply a matter of using your
distribution's package manager. If you want the source, it is available
at the SourceForge site (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/extrema" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/extrema</a>). At SourceForge, there
also is a Windows version,
in case you are stuck using such an operating system. 
</p><p>
Once it is installed
on your Linux box, launching it is as simple as typing in
<tt  >extrema</tt> and
pressing Enter. At start up, you should see two windows: a visualization
window and an analysis window (Figure 1). One of the most important buttons
is the help button. In the analysis window, you can bring it up by clicking
on the question mark (Figure 2). In the help window, you can get more
detailed information on all the functions and operators available
in Extrema. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332extremaf1.large.jpg"><img src="11332extremaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. On startup, you are presented with a blank visualization window
and an analysis window.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332extremaf2.large.jpg"><img src="11332extremaf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The help window gives you information on all of the available
functions, operators and commands.
</p></div></div><p>
Extrema provides 3-D contour and density plots. For 2-D
graphing, you can control almost all the features, like axes, plot
points, colors, fonts and legends. You also can do some data analysis
from within Extrema. You can do various types of interpolation, such
as linear, Lagrange or Fritsch-Carlson. You can fit an equation to your
data with up to 25 parameters. Extrema contains a full scripting language
that includes nested loops, branches and conditional statements. You 
either can write out scripts in a text editor or use the automatic
script-writing mode that translates your point-and-click actions to the
equivalent script commands.
</p><p>
The first thing you will need to do is get your data into Extrema. Data
is stored in variables and is referenced by the variable's name. The
first character of a variable name must be alphabetic and cannot be
any longer than 32 characters. Other than these restrictions, variable
names can contain any alphabetic or numeric characters, underscores
or dollar signs. Unlike most things in Linux, variable names are
case-insensitive. And remember, function names are reserved, so you
can't use them as variable names. 
</p><p>
String variables can contain either
a single string of text or an array of text strings. Numeric variables
can contain a single number, a vector (1-D array), a matrix (2-D array)
or a tensor (3-D array). All numbers are stored as double-precision
real values. Unlike most other programming languages, these arrays
are indexed starting at 1, rather than 0. There are no limits to the
size of these arrays, other than the amount of memory available on your
machine. Indexing arrays in Extrema can be interesting. If you want the
eighth element of array x, you simply can reference it with
<tt  >x[8]</tt>. You can
grab elements 8, 9 and 10 with <tt  >x[8:10]</tt>. These indices can be replaced
with expressions, so you could get the eighth element with
<tt  >x[2^3]</tt>. 
</p><p>
There
also are special characters that you can use in indexing arrays. The
statement <tt  >x[*]</tt> refers to all the values in the vector. If you want
the last element, you can use <tt  >x[#]</tt>. The second-to-last element can be
referenced with <tt  >x[#-1]</tt>.
</p><p>
You likely have all of your data stored in files. The simplest file
format is a comma-separated list of values. Extrema can read in these types
of files and store the data directly into a set of variables. If
you have a file with two columns of data, you can load them into two
variables with the statement:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
READ file1.dat x y
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can read in all of the data and store it into a single matrix
with:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
READ\matrix file1.dat m nrows
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to do this, you need to provide the number of rows that are being
read in. You also can generate data to be used in your analysis. If you
simply need a series of numbers, you can use:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
x = [startval:stopval:stepsize]
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give you an array of numbers starting at
<tt  >startval</tt>, incrementing by
<tt  >stepsize</tt> until you reach
<tt  >stopval</tt>. You can use the
<tt  >GENERATE</tt> command
to do this as well. The GENERATE command also will generate an array of random
numbers with:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
GENERATE\RANDOM x min max num_points
</pre>
</p><p>
Extrema has all of the standard functions available, like the various types
of trigonometric functions. The standard arithmetic operators are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
+ &mdash; addition
</p></li><li><p>
- &mdash; subtraction
</p></li><li><p>
* &mdash; multiplication
</p></li><li><p>
/ &mdash; division
</p></li><li><p>
^ &mdash; exponentiation
</p></li><li><p>
() &mdash; grouping of terms
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There also are special operators for matrix and vector operations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&gt;&lt; &mdash; outer product
</p></li><li><p>
&lt;&gt; &mdash; inner product
</p></li><li><p>
&lt;- &mdash; matrix transpose
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;- &mdash; matrix reflect
</p></li><li><p>
/| &mdash; vector union
</p></li><li><p>
/&amp; &mdash; vector intersection
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There also is a full complement of logical Boolean operators that give
true (1) or false (0) results.
</p><p>
Now that you have your data and have seen some of the basic functions
and operators available, let's take a look at graphing this
data and doing some analysis on it. The most basic type of graph is plotting
a one-dimensional array. When you do this, Extrema treats the data as the y
value and the array index as the x value. To see this in action, you can
use:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
x = [1:10:1]
GRAPH x
</pre>
</p><p>
This plots a fairly uninteresting straight line (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332extremaf3.large.jpg"><img src="11332extremaf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Plotting a Vector of Values
</p></div></div><p>
To plot
two-dimensional data, you can use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GRAPH x y
</pre>
</p><p>
where x and y are two vectors of equal length. The default is to draw the
data joined by a solid line. If you want your data as a series of
disconnected points, you can set the point type to a negative number, for
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SET PLOTSYMBOL -1
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can go ahead and graph your data. 
</p><p>
Parametric plots also
are possible. Let's say you have an independent variable called t that runs
from 0 to 2*Pi. You then can plot t*sin(t) and t*cos(t) with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
t = [0:2*pi:0.1]
x = t * sin(t)
y = t * cos(t)
graph x y
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give you the plot shown in Figure 4. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332extremaf4.large.jpg"><img src="11332extremaf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Graphing a Parametric Plot
</p></div></div><p>
In scientific experiments,
you usually have some value for error in your measurements. You can
include this in your graphs as an extra parameter to the graph command,
assuming these error values are stored in an extra variable. So, you could
use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
graph x y yerr
</pre>
</p><p>
to get a nice plot. Many options are available for the graph
command (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332extremaf5.large.jpg"><img src="11332extremaf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The graph command has many available options.
</p></div></div><p>
More complicated data can be graphed in three dimensions. There are several
types of 3-D graphs, including contour plots and surface plots. The simplest
data structure would be a matrix, where the indices represent the x and y
values, and the actual numbers in the matrix are the z values. If this
doesn't work, you can represent the separate x, y and z values with three
different vectors, all of the same length. The most basic contour graph can
be made with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONTOUR m
</pre>
</p><p>
where m is the matrix of values to be graphed. In this case, Extrema
will make a selection of &ldquo;nice&rdquo; contour lines that create a reasonable
graph. 
</p><p>
You can draw a density plot of the same data with the density
command, where the values in your matrix are assigned a color from
a color map, and that is what gets graphed. Unless you say differently,
Extrema will try to select a color map that fits your data the best. A
surface plot tries to draw a surface in the proper perspective to show
what surface is defined by the z values in your data.
</p><p>
Let's finish by looking at one of the more important analysis steps,
fitting an equation to your data. The point of much of science is to develop
equations that describe the data being observed, in the hope that you 
then will be able to predict what you would see under different conditions. Also,
you may learn some important underlying physics by looking at the structure
of the equation that fits your data. Let's look at a simple fitting of a
straight line. Let's assume that the data is stored in two vectors called x
and y. You'll also need two other variables to store the slope and
intercept. Let's call them b and a. Then you can fit your data with the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SCALAR\FIT a b
FIT y=a+b*x
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, if you want to graph your straight line fit and your data, you can do
something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SET PLOTSYMBOL -1
SET PLOTSYMBOLCOLOR RED
GRAPH x y
SET PLOTSYMBOL 0
SET CURVECOLOR BLUE
GRAPH x a+b*x
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have seen the basics of what Extrema can do, hopefully you will
be inspired to explore it further. It should be able to meet
most of your data-analysis needs, and you can have fun using the same
tool that is being used by leading particle physicists.

As a LibreOffice user, and an OpenOffice.org user before that, the idea of
printing to a PDF is nothing new. If you're stuck on a Windows machine,
however, it's not always easy to &ldquo;be green&rdquo; by printing to a digital
file. Thankfully, there's the trusty PDFCreator package. PDFCreator
installs like any other program in Windows and then creates a virtual
printer that any program can use to generate PDF files.

I often discuss the Linux port of Scrivener with my writer friend Ken
McConnell. We both like Scrivener's interface, and we both prefer to
use Linux as our writing platform. Unfortunately, the Linux port of
Scrivener just doesn't compare to the OS X version. The other day, Ken
told me about Plume Creator.

With a very similar interface, Plume Creator will feel quite familiar
to any Scrivener user. It's very early in development, but it already
behaves much nicer than the Linux port of Scrivener. If you've

If you've ever run Valve Software's Steam client on your Linux box
using Wine, you know that even if you pretend it works well, it really
doesn't. Wouldn't it be great if Valve finally would release a native
client for Linux? Thankfully, Valve agrees! On a recent
blog post (<a href="http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins" target="_self">blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins</a>) the Valve
folks verify that they're creating a native Ubuntu 12.04 Steam client. It's bad
news for zombies, however, because the first game they're porting to
the penguin platform is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Left For Dead 2</em></span>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11332steamf1.large.jpg"><img src="11332steamf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Granted, the Steam client alone doesn't mean the Linux game library
will explode overnight, but it does mean game developers will have one
more reason to take Linux users seriously. There have been rumors of
Steam for Linux for years, but this time, it looks like it really
will happen! Stay tuned to the Valve blog for more details.
