Are shell scripts inevitably antiquated, is Dave writing Bourne Shell
scripts for UNIX, not even writing about Linux? Read on to find out about
his latest letter from a reader and subsequent explanation of his philosophy
of writing scripts for publication.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e40358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I get letters. Well, I don't get very many letters, truth be told, but I
do occasionally get interesting dispatches from the field, and a recent one
took me to task for writing about UNIX, not Linux, and for focusing on the
Bourne Shell, not Bash. Which is odd.
</p><p>
When you're on the command line or writing a shell script, things are
pretty darn similar across Linux and UNIX due to the POSIX standard that
defines syntax, notational conventions and so on. And in terms of the wealth of
commands available? My experience is that if you rely on
&ldquo;non-standard&rdquo; Linux commands like some of the more-sophisticated GNU
utilities, you might find yourself in a right pickle when only the more
lobotomized versions are available on a job site or with particular hardware
that, yes, might be running a flavor of UNIX. It happens.
</p><p>
Same with Bash versus Bourne shell, although since I do write about shell
functions and various other more-advanced features and because I never test the
scripts in this column against Bourne Shell (not being Jason, after all),
well, just because I'm not using your favorite Bash features and shortcuts
doesn't mean I'm using that &ldquo;other&rdquo; shell, does it?
</p><p>
The most valuable part in the letter was to remind me that there are some
slick notational conventions that are added to modern Bash shells that can
clean up some of our conditional statements and structures. It was good
reminder&mdash;old dog, new tricks, and all that. Let's have a look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e40670"></a>
Shortening Conditional Tests</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first programming languages I learned was APL. You probably
haven't even heard of it, but it was a remarkably powerful language
characterized by lots of special notations that gave you the ability to
produce sophisticated results in just a line or two. The problem was, no one could
debug it, and the common belief was that it was faster to rewrite a program
than to figure out what another programmer was thinking.
</p><p>
This recurred the first time I looked at Perl, and I even said so to Larry
Wall when we bumped into each other years ago. When a script or program looks
like your cat ran across the keyboard, it might be very efficient, but
it's sure hard to debug later, even if it's your own code.
</p><p>
And onward to Linux. When working on shell scripts, you're used to seeing
single brackets for conditional expressions, like this:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -n $value ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
What I haven't explained is that every time you write a conditional in
this form, it actually invokes a subshell process to solve the equation. Write
it with double brackets, however:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [[ -n $value ]] ; then
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e40988"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you'll force the test to remain within the shell itself, which will
make your scripts faster and more efficient. There's also some benefit in
terms of strict quoting of arguments in expressions too, because they
don't have to be handed to a subshell, you can often get away with sloppier
quoting using the <tt  >[[ ]]</tt> notation.
</p><p>
The question is, how much faster is it, and is it worth making your scripts
just a bit more obfuscated, particularly for us old dogs who are used to the
<tt  >[ ]</tt> notation? On the vast majority of systems, in the vast majority
of cases, I don't think it speeds things up much at all. By their very
nature, shell scripts aren't written to be maximally efficient. If you
need lightening performance, there are better&mdash;albeit more
complicated&mdash;languages you can use, like C++ or even Perl. Just keep your cat away from the
keyboard.
</p><p>
The same goes for another notational convention that I eschew in the interest of
writing maximally clear and readable script code. It turns out that a conditional
statement like:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -n $value ] ; then
  echo value $value is non-zero
fi
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e40c48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
also can be written more succinctly as:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">

[ -n $value ] &amp;&amp; echo value $value is non-zero

</pre>
</p><p>
In this situation, <tt  >&amp;&amp;</tt> means &ldquo;if the previous command had a
'true' exit status, do the next one&rdquo; and <tt  >||</tt> means the
opposite, as in:

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
[ -n $value ] || echo value $value has a length of zero
</pre>
</p><p>
More efficient? Certainly if we use <tt  >[[ ]]</tt> instead of the single
brackets we have now, but is it worth the obfuscation? Perhaps in code that
you're delivering to a client or that you are writing as a fast throw-away
script for a specific task, but the code I publish here needs to be easily
understood. Then we weave in efficiency.
</p><p>
To get a sense of how long I've been chewing on how to write legible,
easily understood code, I'll just say that when I first started coding in
Fortran-77 I loved that you could have spaces in variable and function names,
letting me write code that was even more like an algorithm instead of a
complicated program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e410c0"></a>
Variable Expansion Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
Speaking of tricks and cats running across keyboards, I've also avoided
some of the really complicated ${} notational options in the interest of
having my scripts be as widely portable as possible. For example, I tend to
write:

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
length=$(echo $word | wc -c) ; length=$(( $length - 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
It's clunky and admittedly inefficient. A smarter way to do it:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
length=$(( ${#word} ))
</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out that the ${# notation produces the number of characters in the value
of the specified variable. That's easy!
</p><p>
If you look at the Bash man page, you'll know that there are dozens of
different syntactic shortcuts like this. Remembering which is which when for
the majority of you readers shell script programming is a useful additional
skill, not your main job, is probably more trouble than it's worth.
</p><p>
Don't believe me? Alright, what does this do?
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo ${value^^}
</pre>
</p><p>
I'd never seen this notation before this particular reader sent me his
message, but it turns out that in Bash4 (not earlier versions of Bash), it
transliterates lowercase to uppercase. That's something I'd usually
write like this:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
$(echo $value | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]')
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, a slight variation that taps into the modern &lt;&lt;&lt; notation:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">

$(tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]' &lt;&lt;&lt; $value)

</pre>
</p><p>
Which is better? Indeed, across all of these shortcuts and modern tweaks to
the Bash shell, which are better?
</p><p>
I'll let you tell me, dear reader. Drop me a note and tell me if you would
prefer us publishing sample scripts with all of these notational tricks, even
at the risk of broad portability across environments and systems, or do you
prefer more &ldquo;standard&rdquo; old-school scripting techniques that will even
work on that clunky old server you administer?
