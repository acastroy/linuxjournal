Using Linux open-source hardware design tools to create an Arduino-inspired
hardware project.

I became aware of the Arduino Project from
occasional media reports and a presentation at Atlanta LinuxFest 2009. I
was impressed with what the Arduino community was doing, but at that time,
I saw no personal use for it. It took a grandson who is heavily involved in a
high-school competitive robotics program to change things for
me. During a 2011 Thanksgiving family gathering, he asked
me some questions about robotics-related electronics, and I told him to
google Arduino. He did. Arduino ended up on his Christmas list, and
Santa delivered.
</p><p>
I would be more helpful in assisting the grandson's
Arduino efforts if I understood more about it myself, so I ordered a
couple Arduino Nanos and some peripherals, such as rotors, servos,
ultrasonic sensors and LCD displays, and dug in. I now had a purpose for
using the Arduino and a reason to dust off my soldering iron. I used a
breadboard for testing, as shown in Figure 1.

It didn't take very long to remove the mental cobwebs and get into the
elegant simplicity of the Arduino Project. Years ago, when I built
microprocessor projects, the underlying system code always was the
problem. Before I actually could write my application, I had to develop
or adapt systems-level code to interface the application-level code with
the underlying hardware. It was always a major pain and, quite frankly,
drudgery. The Arduino Project does away with worrying about most of
the low-level systems code, leaving you with the now much-simplified
task of creating your application. Using the Arduino IDE and included
or contributed libraries enables you to interface to a plethora
of hardware easily. Anyone who has developed in the C and C++ languages will
find the Arduino platform easy to master quickly. Although Arduino is
actually based upon the Wiring Project, compatibility with C, C++
and Linux are very high.
</p><p>
After implementing and testing code for the various peripherals that I
had accumulated and generally mastering the Arduino platform, I said to
myself, &ldquo;now what?&rdquo; So, I abandoned the nice Arduino IDE and switched
over to developing code using Linux tools, such as Make. I also wanted
to get closer to the hardware, so I abandoned the Arduino boards and did
my implementations on the underlying ICs used by all Arduino boards, the
Atmel 8-bit series of microcontrollers. Using the Arduino libraries with
the Atmel microcontrollers is a joy to behold. I am so thrilled that the
drudgery of systems code can be mostly ignored as it is mainly handled by
the hardware abstraction features of Arduino's built-in libraries. It
is important to note that the Atmel ICs are microcontrollers, not
microprocessors. In other words, they are almost complete computers
equipped with RAM, EPROM and FLASH memory, multidirectional I/O, serial
ports (in some cases) and interface circuitry (such as pull-up resistors and
so on). Just adding a power source will yield a computer in a chip.
</p><p>
The hardware's interfaces of the Atmel microcontroller are abstracted
by Arduino in a uniform way&mdash;at least, uniform for those Atmel
micrcontrollers implemented by the Arduino group. Arduino libraries
use internal code, generically called the &ldquo;core&rdquo;, to define the
available I/O pins on a given Atmel microcontroller, assigned by pin number.
For example, the Atmel ATMega168 physical pin 4 is defined as Arduino
I/O pin 2, yet with the Atmal ATMega32u4 microcontroller, the same
Arduino pin 2 is matched to physical pin 19. Thus, the Arduino syntax of
&ldquo;pinMode(2, OUTPUT)&rdquo; defines, in software, an abstracted hardware
pin as a digital output. Because the Arduino module pins are labeled with
Arduino pin numbers, the abstraction becomes physical, at least
on the module level. Nonetheless, it is this abstraction as well as
robust libraries that enable the Arduino to be so easy to work with. One
caveat alluded to above is that Atmel microcontrollers not implemented in
Arduino modules don't have uniform core definitions&mdash;for example, the
Atmel Attiny series. You still can use the Arduino libraries and tools,
but the cores must be obtained elsewhere. For the Atmel ATtiny85 and
Attiny 84 microcontrollers, I use the core from the code.google project
named arduino-tiny. However, there are other, competing cores around
for these chips, and they are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessarily compatible.
</p><p>
Burning your program into an Arduino module is extremely easy to
accomplish. The USB connection not only can power the module as well
as serve as the serial communications interface, but the Arduino IDE also
uses it to install your program into the Flash memory. It is more
complex with the Atmel ATtiny series, because they have no USB port or
even a hardware serial port, for that matter. For the ATtiny series,
you must use an external programmer. Many people use an Arduino board as
the programmer once they have loaded the ArduinoISP software, or
sketch, as programs are named in the Arduino world. In my case, I chose to
use a dedicated programmer called a USBasp. It is readily available on
eBay, or you even can make your own with plans from its creator, Thomas
Fischl. I purchased mine on eBay because it was cheaper than the parts
cost to make my own. The USBasp uses the open-source AVRdude software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272e828"></a>
The Project</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I had invested a lot of
time into learning the Arduino system and the Atmel microcontrollers, I
wanted to take the next logical step: move a design from the breadboard
to a printed circuit board. Some interesting projects exist in this
area, such as Fritzing, which is designed to facilitate doing exactly that.
It's a
clever project and you should check it out, but I
took a different path&mdash;using the gEDA open-source Linux software suite
for printed circuit development.
</p><p>
I looked at my inventory of parts and started thinking of what I could
create that wasn't already readily available. I settled upon the LCD
display. The displays being used in Arduino projects were interfaced
with a lot of I/O pins and code space, neither of which are in great
supply on the Atmel chips. I felt that if I could create a same-size
daughter board that I could attach onto the back of the display and put
the smarts into the board that would communicate with the LCD display
via an ASCII serial interface, I would have something 
useful that didn't exist in the marketplace in an affordable form. This
is commonly called a serial LCD.
</p><p>
Being somewhat of an old-timer, I spent a lot of time using and coding
for the DEC VT100 display terminals upon which the ECMA-48/ANSI X3.64
standards are based. I felt that if I coded the daughter board to turn an
LCD display into a tiny, affordable DEC-VT100, I would have something
reasonably unique and useful. Serial-driven LCD displays do exist, but they
typically have proprietary protocols, and some are rather expensive. As far
as I have been able to determine, there exists no open-source (software
and hardware) serial LCD display with VT100 protocol. I found my project!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272ea38"></a>
Gathering the Parts</h2></div></div><p>
I selected parts for the VT100-LCD project, such that the parts would be
as affordable as possible. In fact, I purchased all the parts from two
sources, eBay and Digi-Key, based on cost.
Table 1 shows the required materials to build one
vt100lcd. Costs are shown on a per-item basis; however, I purchased most
of these items in quantities of five or more.

Schematic Design</h2></div></div><p>
To design the circuitry for the VT100-LCD, I chose gschem of the gEDA
Project by <a href="http://geda-project.org" target="_self">geda-project.org</a>. This suite includes not only the schematic
design program but also a PCB layout program, as well as various helper
programs. A number of schematic/PCB design software programs exist, but I'm
focusing on the open-source software of the gEDA Project
by geda-project.org here. Other open-source projects that run on Linux,
include KiCad, as well as several commercial products, the most popular
of which is Eagle PCB by CadSoft, which runs pretty well under WINE.
</p><p>
gschem is fairly straightforward, and many functions are intuitive, but
a few, useful but arcane commands necessitate printing
out a cheat sheet (hey, I'm getting older and I can't memorize all
of those keystrokes). Yes, although gschem is a GUI program,
useful keyboard shortcuts appear nowhere in the GUI's menus. This
is especially true of the PCB layout program that I discuss later.
</p><p>
The process consists of inserting electronic component symbols into the
schematic drawing either from the built-in library or from your private
library and then connecting the pins by drawing traces. I highly recommend
reviewing the gEDA Project's on-line documentation before starting your
own schematic. There are a few tutorials on the Web about using the
gEDA suite, and Stuart Brorson wrote a tutorial article in the November
2005 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (see Resources).
</p><p>
I created two versions of my VT100-LCD project: one using the eight-pin
ATtiny85 microcontroller and another using the 14-pin ATtiny84
microcontroller. The schematic for the ATtiny84 microcontroller version
is shown in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f2.large.jpg"><img src="11300f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Schematic for VT100LCD e/w ATtiny84
</p></div></div><p>
Because some of the components I was using do not exist in the
built-in library, I scoured the Internet for contributed symbols,
and in a few cases, I had to design my own symbols. A good source for
contributed symbols and footprints is <a href="http://gedasymbols.org" target="_self">gedasymbols.org</a>. For creating your
own symbols, see David Weber's Online Symbol Creation Tool at
<a href="http://EmbeddedToolBox.com" target="_self">EmbeddedToolBox.com</a>. Symbols actually are text files. Figure 3 
illustrates a symbol along with a portion of the text file used to draw
it. Symbol files are not just an image. They also hold important pin
definitions and the name of the footprint file that the gEDA PCB program
ultimately will use to represent the component on the circuit board.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f3.large.jpg"><img src="11300f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Symbol Example 1
</p></div></div><p>
A gEDA schematic is a text file interpreted for GUI presentation by gschem,
but it also serves as the source for gEDA's PCB program. An intermediary
helper program named gsch2pcb is used to prepare the schematic file
for use as input to the PCB program. While xgsch2pcb is a GUI version
of gsch2pcb for gsch2pcb, I use the gsch2pcb command-line version. For
example, given the schematic file vt100lcd84.sch as an input, gsch2pcb
creates vt100lcd84.pcb, vt100lcd84.net and vt100lcd84.cmd, all necessary
files for PCB creation. gsch2pcb also displays important instructions as
part of its command-line text output. To make the process a little easier,
I use a file named &ldquo;project&rdquo; in the project folder for the current
design. Figure 4 shows my project folder for the vt100lcd84
project, the &ldquo;project&rdquo; file and the command line with the gsch2pcb
command just before execution.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f4.large.jpg"><img src="11300f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Example of gsch2pcb Project File
</p></div></div><p>
It is worth noting that the gEDA suite includes circuit simulation
capability (SPICE), enabling virtual design testing. I did not use SPICE
with my VT100-LCD project, but see the Resources for this article if
you are interested.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x2728028"></a>
Software Design</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I had the circuitry designed for the project, it was time for
the software. I wrote the software as a simple state machine that parses
each character received on a character-by-character basis, meaning that
there is no buffer. Characters are handled differently based upon the
current state of the machine. If the state is NOTSPECIAL, the
character simply is passed to the LCD screen for display. However,
if the state is GOTESCAPE, GOTBRACKET or INNUM, the character is
processed further. For example, if the state is GOTBRACKET, both an
escape and left-bracket character have been received previously, and the
current character must be parsed in that context. For illustration, the
VT100 sequence for Screen-Clear is \033[2J, and if the current character
being parsed was the 2, the state would be GOTBRACKET, and the
next state would be INNUM (number collection).
</p><p>
This method of parsing has the advantage of simplicity, which is suitable
for the limited-capacity microcontrollers but with the disadvantage of not
being able to scroll the screen due to the absence of a buffer holding a
copy what is on the screen. See Resources for a copy of the software source. 
I used Arduino libraries to build the code. Although the
source can be compiled using the Arduino IDE, I used Linux make. Using the
Arduino libraries makes the project extremely easy to build. Most of the
drudgery of low-level code and the bootloader is hidden away within the
Arduino libraries, which freed me to focus solely on my project. Even main()
is hidden away such that Arduino code contains two required routines:
setup() and loop(). Main actually does exist deep in the Arduino directory
structure in ~/arduino/arduino-1.0/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/main.cpp
and is automatically linked in at compile time.

PCB Layout</h2></div></div><p>
When the .pcb file is opened with gEDA's PCB program and the commands
invoked are listed in the gsch2pcb command-line text output, you are
presented with a jumble of components. I first dispersed
the components manually with an approximate placement and then activated the
&ldquo;rats-nest&rdquo; display. The &ldquo;rats-nest&rdquo; is the connections that
must be converted to copper traces. After shifting around components to
visually bring the &ldquo;rats-nest&rdquo; connections to their shortest routes,
I was presented with what you see in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f5.large.jpg"><img src="11300f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Components with Associated Rats-Nest
</p></div></div><p>
PCB possesses the ability to auto-route the traces, namely convert the
&ldquo;rats-nest&rdquo; into copper trace representations. This tends to do some
odd things but produces a workable PCB design once a cleanup is done. I
chose a semi-manual layout so I could control the placement and
appearance. Basically, I used the auto-route for the power traces, did
some manual cleanup, then used auto-route for the signal traces, followed
by more cleanup. The result was similar to Figure 6, which is
my second and final version of the layout for the ATtiny84 version of my
VT100LCD project. PCB Manufacture Printed Circuit Board layout consists
of applying upon a copper laminated board an acid-resistant pattern
that represents the areas that are to retain copper after etching in an
acid solution (etchant). Areas of the copper laminated board that are
exposed to the etchant will be dissolved away, leaving the areas under
the acid-resistant pattern intact.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f6.large.jpg"><img src="11300f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Final Layout of vt1001cd84 Project
</p></div></div><p>
Years ago, I occasionally used to make Printed Circuit Boards using a
photographic method that is less common in the DIY
community today. The acid-resistant pattern was laid out by hand
onto translucent or clear drafting paper using fine black tape for
circuit paths and dry transfer patterns for components. This pattern is
typically a positive, similar to Figure 7, so a negative must
be made photographically for the process to work. The end result is
that the negative's acetate sheet is clear where copper should remain
after etching. This photographic work formerly was done in a darkroom,
but today, creating the negative can be done using a computer printing
to a transparency sheet. I don't discuss the process here, but an
example is shown in Figure 8.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f7.large.jpg"><img src="11300f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 8. Layout Negative
</p></div></div><p>
Next, the prepared negative pattern would be affixed on a copper
laminated board that has a light-sensitive diazo-type emulsion as a top
layer. Exposing the prepared PCB to ultra-violet light would alter the
properties of the exposed (clear) areas that received the ultra-violet
light. Washing the exposed board in a chemical developer dissolved the
exposed portions of the emulsion, leaving intact the emulsion that was
under the black portions of pattern on prepared negative sheet. Many
commercial systems still do a modernized variation of this process as
do some serious DIYers.
</p><p>
The casual DIY community has, thankfully, adopted a new and much easier
method of PCB layout for medium-density layouts. High-density layouts
still should use the photographic process. The new DIY PCB layout process
is commonly called the toner transfer method, because a laser
printer is involved. Thankfully, the old paste-up tape and dry-transfer
component patterns are a thing of the past. Computer software is now
available for the DIY community that takes software-designed schematics as
input and produces a representative PCB layout (Figure 7 was produced
by such software).
</p><p>
As I mentioned earlier, a number of PCB design software
programs exist, but I'm focusing on 
the open-source PCB program of the
gEDA project by geda-project.org here. An example of an in-progress gEDA PCB
layout is shown in Figure 9, and its final output is a positive similar
to Figure 7.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11300f9.large.jpg"><img src="11300f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. gEDA PCB Layout in Progress
</p></div></div><p>
The positive of Figure 7 needs to be printed in reverse onto a paper
that easily will release the toner when heated. Laser printer toner is
a finely ground polymer plastic that is fused to the paper by heat. The
trick of the &ldquo;toner method&rdquo; is to get the toner to transfer from
the paper to the copper-laminated board once it is re-heated. 
A big part of the secret here is the type of paper you use.
</p><p>
Several paper solutions for the &ldquo;toner method&rdquo; exist, and
some are better
than others. Regardless of the type of paper used, the process is to
place the reverse image positive laser print with the toner touching the
metal surface of a clean copper-laminated board and then apply heat and
pressure to loosen the toner from the paper, permitting it to transfer
to and adhere to the copper laminated board. Most DIYers use a common
clothes iron as the heat source, although a laminating machine designed
for identification cards is successfully used with one commercial product
that I'll talk about later.
</p><p>
The cheapest and simplest method is simply to use ordinary copier
paper. Once heated under pressure, the toner ends up adhering to both the
paper and the copper-laminated board. The paper/copper-laminated board
is then soaked under water, and the waterlogged paper is rubbed off with
your fingers. This method leaves a lot of paper residue embedded in the
toner's surface, this is undesirable for reasons explained later.
</p><p>
Many other paper types are used by various DIYers. One of the most
popular is to use a high-quality magazine page that has a smooth, glossy
appearance. The gloss is caused by a white clay (kaolin) coating. Because
the kaolin fills in many of the pores of the paper, the toner is less
firmly bonded to the paper. Second, the kaolin dissolves in water,
thus freeing the toner more readily than plain paper. This method is
superior to using plain paper, but it still leaves too much paper residue
embedded in the toner's surface.
</p><p>
Another popular method is to print onto the glossy side of photo paper or
backing paper for labels. This method is superior to either plain paper or
high-quality magazine paper, because there is no paper residue embedded in
the toner's surface. However, a significant problem with this method is
actually getting the toner to stick to the paper evenly. Quite often, PCB
traces simply fall off the slick surface while the paper works
its way through the printer. Obviously, there is a lot of variability
among laser printers and glossy paper types. I don't like variability;
I like dependable repeatability.
</p><p>
This leads me to the paper and method I use that has dependable,
predictable results. The paper is colloquially known as dextrin-coated
paper. Some DIYers actually make their own by making dextrin and coat
paper with it. Dextrin is simply cooked corn starch, and the process is
easy albeit a bit labor- and time-intensive. Also, getting an even coat is
a challenge. If you are interested, numerous articles and videos
exist on the subject&mdash;simply google &ldquo;make dextrin paper&rdquo;. I, however,
feel that purchasing commercial dextrin paper is worth the cost. My
preferred product is made by PulsarProFX (<a href="http://www.pcbfx.com" target="_self">www.pcbfx.com</a>). The company primarily
sells a kit called Fab-In-A-Box, but the entire kit isn't really
necessary. Instead, buy the refill package of Transfer Paper. Also buy
the Green Toner Foil. Digi-Key sells refill kits of both. Pulsar really
pushes use of a laminator but cautions that its laminator isn't hot
enough to melt the toner used in Brother laser printers. My printer is
a Brother HL-2140, so I simply use a clothes iron. A word of caution here:
use genuine Brother toner. After-market toner cartridges may contain
fuser oil that prevents the toner from adhering to copper. After several
failed boards, I figured out that the problem was my new Rosewill-brand
toner cartridge. When I put in a genuine Brother cartridge, my boards
were successful again.
</p><p>
You need the Green Toner Foil because the toner
adhering to the copper-laminated board is porous, and even though you
cannot see it with the naked eye, there are sufficient holes for the
etchant to penetrate the toner traces and remove metal that you do not
want removed. The Green Toner Foil is ironed onto the copper-laminated
board resident toner, creating a smooth, impervious surface on the top
of the toner traces, resulting in superior board etches. Now, remember
that I said that the aforementioned transfer methods were deficient due
to paper residue embedded in the toner's surface? This is because the
paper residue prevents the Green Toner Foil from making a good bond to
the toner.
</p><p>
How do I make my own single-sided PCBs? It's fairly simple:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Print a reverse image positive of the PCB pattern onto the shiny side of
Pulsar dextrin transfer paper.
</p></li><li><p>
Place the transfer paper's toner side against a copper-laminate board that has
been cleaned with steel wool.
</p></li><li><p>
Place a sheet of ordinary paper above the transfer paper to help prevent
slippage.
</p></li><li><p>
For two minutes, apply, with a few of pounds of pressure, a common clothes
iron set to the highest &ldquo;cotton&rdquo; setting.
</p></li><li><p>
Immerse into water, the ironed-together paper/copper-laminate board. After a
couple minutes, the paper probably will float off. If it doesn't, lift it off.
</p></li><li><p>
Dry the board, and with the toner side up, lay the dull side of the Green Toner
Foil against the toner and another piece of ordinary paper above that.
</p></li><li><p>
Using the same clothes iron set slightly cooler (to &ldquo;wool&rdquo;), iron for
one minute with a few pounds of pressure.
</p></li><li><p>
Peel off the Green Toner Foil.
</p></li><li><p>
Etch the board as described below.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I make only single-sided boards. If you'd like to make a double-sided
board, watch the video at <a href="http://youtu.be/XX7IekbCNIY" target="_self">youtu.be/XX7IekbCNIY</a>. This DIYer uses HP's
glossy brochure paper and seems to get pretty good results.

Etching the PCB</h2></div></div><p>
Having read much of what is readily available on the Web concerning DIY
PCB etching, when the need arose, I decided to etch a single-sided board
two different ways: first with the vinegar and salt method and second with
the sponge and ferric chloride method. Some DIYers are using muriatic
acid, but I have not tried that.
</p><p>
The vinegar and salt method works, albeit slowly. Etching my small
board took two hours. The formula I used was equal parts vinegar
and hydrogen peroxide and a few tablespoons of table salt. Keep adding
salt until the &ldquo;fizzing&rdquo; continues all by itself. The liquid starts
out clear but then turns an attractive shade of blue (Figure 10).

</p></div></div><p>
The sponge and ferric chloride method works extremely well, etching the
same board in a couple of minutes. In the past, I used ferric chloride
to etch boards by placing them into a bath of ferric chloride. Even with
agitation, etching a board could take ten minutes or so. The sponge and
ferric chloride method accelerates the etching by continuously rubbing the
surface with a sponge soaked in ferric chloride. The rubbing removes the
oxide layer that continuously builds up, permitting the ferric chloride
to get to the raw metal and thus accelerate etching. Instead of a tub
of etchant, a couple tablespoons is all you need, which will
make a bottle of ferric chloride last for a very, very long time. The
technique is simple. Don plastic gloves, pour a couple tablespoons
of ferric chloride into a small container, soak a small piece of soft
sponge in the ferric chloride, then continuously and lightly rub the saturated
sponge on the PCB. In a couple minutes, the board will be finished
with little mess and little ferric chloride to dispose of.
</p><p>
My final product (after three versions), a single-sided ATtiny84 version of
the project, is shown in Figure 11. Given that the board was single-sided, nine jumpers were required, which are the wires you can see
on the component side of the board.

Commercially Made PCBs</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to making my own PCBs, I also had commercial boards made by a
panel aggregator. A panel aggregator is a service that aggregates boards
from many sources, filling up a cost-efficient-size printed circuit board
panel and then breaking up the completed panel for delivery. 
Several such companies support the hobbyist community.
