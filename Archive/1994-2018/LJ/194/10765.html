MilkyTracker&mdash;Open Music Tracker
(<a href="http://www.milkytracker.org" target="_self">www.milkytracker.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Fans of musical tracking programs, such as Fasttracker, ProTracker,
CheeseTracker and the like, will want to check out MilkyTracker, which
has been quite popular on SourceForge and has had
pretty widespread distro integration of late. To quote MilkyTracker's
documentation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
MilkyTracker is an open-source, multiplatform music application,
more specifically, part of the tracker family. It attempts to re-create
the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS application
Fasttracker II, with special playback modes available for improved Amiga
ProTracker 2.x/3.x compatibility. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10765f1.large.jpg"><img src="10765f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
MilkyTracker provides all the old-school, low-level control from ye olde days of
music tracking.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10765f2.large.jpg"><img src="10765f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
You don't get much more hard core than waveforms drawn by hand!
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10765f3.large.jpg"><img src="10765f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Thankfully, a keyboard-based instrument editor is included as well.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
When it comes to installation methods, you are pretty spoiled for
choice. Along with the usual source tarball, packages in various
repositories are available for Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Debian, Enlisy, Gentoo
and SUSE, as well packages for our FreeBSD and OpenBSD cousins. Ubuntu
users are doubly spoiled with a binary tarball built upon Karmic.
</p><p>
For those who are running with source, according to the documentation,
MilkyTracker can be compiled using the standard <tt  >./configure; make;
make install</tt> (note that <tt  >make install</tt> requires the use of root
or sudo). However, I ran into compilation problems during the &ldquo;make&rdquo;.
I hope you have more luck. I went with the binary tarball in
the end, which ran with no problems.
</p><p>
As far as libraries go, there shouldn't be <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> much in the way
of strange requirements, although I did need to install libzzip-dev and
libsdl1.2-dev to get past the source code's configure script.
</p><p>
Once your installation has finished, run MilkyTracker with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ milkytracker
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The first thing I recommend doing is loading some of the provided
songs, which instantly will show off MilkyTracker's capabilities. Click
the Load button in the cluster of gray buttons near the top left
of the screen, navigate to the directory in which MilkyTracker has
been installed, and look at the songs directory. Choose one of
the available tracks and click Play Song on the bottom-left corner of the
main cluster of gray buttons. My personal favorite (or at least the most
credible of these tracks&mdash;demonstration songs are always pretty dry) is
&ldquo;slumberjack&rdquo;, which is nice and progressive and shows off MilkyTracker's
capabilities quite nicely.
</p><p>
As the track plays, you'll see a bar move rapidly down the main composition
screen's page 
and move on to other pages of music as the song
progresses into new movements. A welcome feature from classic tracker
programs is the wave visualization inside those windows in the middle
section. They give individual readouts for each channel. It's pretty
cool to watch this multitasking in progress and see
the music's very DNA scroll before your eyes.
</p><p>
I also noticed a very willing use of the stereo spectrum in this program,
which helped to add spice. That said, my favorite part of this
project is the sample editor, which lets you manipulate waveforms by
hand. It also lets you literally draw your own waveforms&mdash;effectively making something from nothing.
</p><p>
However, none of this stuff will come as a surprise to tracker
veterans, who've grown up with such hard-core features since the days of
DOS. Newbies who are used to soft-core programs like FruityLoops will
freak out in this imposing retro environment. Veterans probably
will rejoice in the imposing low-level interface and go back to skulking
around in their basements listening to Kraftwerk and Wumpscut.
</p><p>
Ultimately, MilkyTracker provides an authentic environment for those who
have grown up with these programs, while adding more modern capabilities
and platform diversity. I personally find these programs way too daunting,
but old-school Tracker fans are going to love it.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>&mdash;2-D Arcade Fighting Engine
(<a href="http://paintown.sourceforge.net" target="_self">paintown.sourceforge.net</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/paintown" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/paintown</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Before I begin, there's been some recent controversy over
this project, with the accusation that this project is ripping off
someone else's work. Playdeb.net was sent the following message from
the Senile Team: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It may interest you to know that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>
&ldquo;borrows&rdquo; original work from Senile Team without permission. To
put it more bluntly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> is a rip-off from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beats of Rage</em></span> (see
<a href="http://www.senileteam.com/beatsofrage.html" target="_self">www.senileteam.com/beatsofrage.html</a>).
</p><p>
The source code and assets for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beats of Rage</em></span> are freely available,
and may be used by anyone&mdash;provided of course that they give proper
credit. The author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>, however, has openly refused
to do so, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> should, therefore, be considered in violation of copyrights.
</p><p>
The author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> has on several occasions been confronted with the
impossible similarities between &ldquo;his&rdquo; game and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beats of
Rage</em></span>. However,
rather than admitting to the obvious, he instead decided to alter some
of &ldquo;his&rdquo; code and assets in order to hide their true origin. And yet
even now, the screenshot seen on your site immediately betrays <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> as a rip-off, containing several custom graphics that were made
by Senile Team.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I had already written this month's piece when I received this information, and
Playdeb.net took down the package (although things may change by
the time this article is printed). However, I feel it's best to pass on
this information
and let you decide for yourself.
</p><p>
This is not my genre of gaming and I'm
far from an expert, but this project instantly caught my attention and
seems to have a great deal of potential. To quote the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> is a 2-D engine for fighting games. If you are looking for
a side-scrolling, action-packed game like you used to play, or if you
are looking for an extensible engine to write your own game, look no
further. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> supports user-created content through a mod system
and user-defined functionality through scripting.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> also supports an implementation of M.U.G.E.N. Our goal is to
be 100% compatible with M.U.G.E.N 2002.04.14 beta as well as supporting
any new updates in the 1.0 version.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> is completely open source, and we would love any contributions
in the form of code, art or donations. Give <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> a try!
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> has the following features, according to the
Web site: low CPU and GPU requirements, network play, dynamic lighting,
joystick support, mod/s3m/xm/it music modules, scripting with Python and
the M.U.G.E.N engine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10765f4.large.jpg"><img src="10765f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> can be a bit intense, with lots of giblets, spinal cord and whatnot.
Don't tell Mum though.

<span   class="bold"><b>
Installation and Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
At the Web site, a source tarball was (supposedly) available, but I ran 
into some trouble with it.
The Web site link wasn't working at the time of this writing, and it gave an
error. However, the link from the project's Freshmeat page was working
fine. I'll leave the rest of the installation details to you on this one,
as things seem to be a bit up in the air with this particular project.
</p><p>
Inside the game, things are fairly intuitive, but documentation for
some of the finer details is lacking, so please forgive me if I make
some dumb errors. There are three main components: Adventure Mode,
Adventure Mode with Computer and M.U.G.E.N mode. Adventure Mode puts
you in a sideways-scrolling street-brawl game, with changing scenery
and characters in the style of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fight</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Double
Dragon</em></span> and so
on. Adventure Mode with Computer adds a computer-controlled Player 2,
and you can assign a different character to each player.
</p><p>
The beauty of a noncommercial game such as this is that fans generally
add their favorite characters from other games, and here you can choose
from such characters as Ryu and Blanka from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Street Fighter</em></span>, Goku from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dragon Ball</em></span> and even the time-honored
Wolverine!
</p><p>
Each character has different strengths and weaknesses, and Attack buttons
vary between them all. Nevertheless, there are similarities between
most characters: Attack 1 usually is punch, Attack 2 is a kick,
and Attack 3 generally grabs an opponent. A character may have only one
Attack button in use, but that Attack will be particularly devastating. Or,
all three Attack buttons will be used, but with less power in each,
although a more even spread.
</p><p>
Now let's look at M.U.G.E.N mode. For those not in the know,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>M.U.G.E.N</em></span> was
a 2-D fighting game built around customization, creating characters,
background stages and so on. It spawned a community all its own with
versions for DOS, Windows and, thankfully, Linux. These communities 
still are running strongly today with extraordinarily dedicated projects, such
as the Infinity M.U.G.E.N Team's highly ambitious <span   class="emphasis"><em>Marvel vs.
Capcom</em></span>,
which is an entire gig's download!
</p><p>
As for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>'s M.U.G.E.N game, it's very basic and rudimentary,
with only one character from which to choose and fight against, with some
joking cutscenes before and after playtime. Promisingly enough, it
does have a training mode, as seen in the later years of this genre,
so I look forward to seeing how things progress, given the attention
to detail. Unfortunately, I'm out of space, so I can't really give
it the coverage it deserves. I also didn't get a chance to look at the
multiplayer networking side of things, but I'm sure it will make office
lunch hours a good laugh!
</p><p>
Although this is not really my genre, and I'm not comfortable with advocating
violent video games, I'd be remiss in my duties to not report on it due
to my own biases. The open framework of this project is marvelous, and its
integration of M.U.G.E.N is all the better, which should
breathe life into a genre that's mostly been abandoned by mainstream
commercial gaming. Plus, the noncommercial aspect allows fans to live
out their gaming character fantasies that commercial licensing would
simply not allow.
