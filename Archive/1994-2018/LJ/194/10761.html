Tips for success in using OpenVPN for secure remote access.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x255b460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my four previous columns, I showed, in painstaking
detail, how to set up OpenVPN to allow remote users to create secure remote-access connections&mdash;Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels&mdash;over the Internet
back to your personal or corporate network. By now, you should understand how
VPN technologies in general, and TLS/SSL-based VPNs in specific, work and how
to create working server and client configurations for OpenVPN.
</p><p>
This month, I wrap up the series, with some miscellaneous but important notes
about the previous columns' client-server scenario, including instructions on
enabling IP forwarding, some tips on using a Web proxy and enforcing DNS use
through the tunnel, and on &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; all VPN clients' IP addresses behind that
of your OpenVPN server. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x255b6c8"></a>
Review</h2></div></div><p>
Throughout this series, I've been implementing the OpenVPN server
configuration shown in Listing 1, which causes OpenVPN to run in server mode.
In my example scenario, I've got only one remote user connecting to this
OpenVPN server, but if you have more, you should edit the
<tt  >max-clients</tt>
parameter accordingly. Remember, because I've also set fairly liberal tunnel
timeouts in order to minimize the odds that a tunnel will go down due to
network problems, you should add 1 or 2 to the actual number of maximum
concurrent client connections you expect.

The other setting in Listing 1 that I need to review is <tt  >push
"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"</tt>, which pushes the OpenVPN's local
default gateway setting to all clients. This has the effect of causing VPN
clients to route all their Internet traffic through the VPN tunnel, which (as
I discuss shortly) has important security benefits.
</p><p>
The client configuration file that corresponds to Listing 1 is shown in Listing
2. This file works equally well on Linux and Windows client systems. Remember
that the parameter <tt  >remote</tt> specifies the IP address or hostname of your
OpenVPN server and the port on which it's accepting connections.
</p><p>
Remember also that the files ca.crt, minion.crt, minion.key and ta.key
specified by the parameters <tt  >ca</tt>,
<tt  >cert</tt>, <tt  >key</tt> and
<tt  >tls-auth</tt>, respectively,
need to be generated beforehand and placed alongside the configuration file
itself in /etc/openvpn. The certificate and key specified by
<tt  >ca</tt> and <tt  >cert</tt>
should be unique for each client system!

Again, the purpose of the server configuration in Listing 1 and the client
configuration in Listing 2 is to allow a remote user to connect from over the
Internet back to the &ldquo;home&rdquo; network on which the OpenVPN
server resides. (This
may or may not be your residence. By home network, I mean &ldquo;trusted corporate
or personal network&rdquo;, as opposed to the remote network from which you're trying
to connect.) Last month, however, I forgot to mention a critical step that you
must perform on your OpenVPN server if you want remote clients to be able to
communicate with anything besides the server itself: enabling IP forwarding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x255c170"></a>
Enabling IP Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
By default, almost any Linux system is configured not to allow network packets
entering one network interface to be forwarded to and sent out of a different
network interface. This is a Linux security feature. It helps reduce the
likelihood of your Linux system linking different networks together in
undesirable or unintended ways.
</p><p>
But, generally you do want an OpenVPN server to link different networks. The
exceptions to this are if:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
All services and resources your remote users need are housed on the OpenVPN
server itself.
</p></li><li><p>
It's possible to run proxy applications on the OpenVPN server that can proxy
connections to services not hosted on it.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In the first case, once remote users have connected to the OpenVPN
server successfully, they can connect to other services hosted on that server by targeting
the server's real/local IP address rather than its Internet-facing address. For
example, the client configuration in Listing 2 is targeting a server
address of 1.2.3.4, which is Internet-routable. Suppose that this is actually
a router or firewall address that is translated to your OpenVPN server's
address 10.0.0.4.
</p><p>
To <tt  >ssh</tt> to the OpenVPN server after you've established a tunnel to it, you'd
target 10.0.0.4, not 1.2.3.4. The same would apply to Samba, NFS, HTTP/S or
any other service running on the OpenVPN server.
</p><p>
In the second case, to reach other resources on the remote network, you would
configure the applications running on your client system to use the OpenVPN
server's real/internal address (10.0.0.4) as its proxy address. The best
example of this is Squid. If all the resources you wanted to reach on your
remote network involve Web services, you could run Squid on the OpenVPN server
and configure your client's Web browser to use 10.0.0.4 as its proxy address
(although this will work only when the tunnel is up). 
</p><p>
In either of the above scenarios, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> need IP forwarding enabled on
the OpenVPN server, because all direct communication between VPN clients and your
home network terminates on the OpenVPN server. If, however, your clients need
to reach other things on the home network or beyond,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> using the
OpenVPN server as a proxy, you do need to enable IP forwarding.
</p><p>
This is very simple. To turn on IP forwarding without having to reboot, simply
execute this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
</pre>
</p><p>
To make this change persistent across reboots, uncomment the following line in
/etc/sysctl.conf (you'll need to <tt  >su</tt> to root or use sudo to edit this file):

<pre     class="programlisting">
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x255c958"></a>
Web Proxies and VPN Clients</h2></div></div><p>
In talking about the value of using VPN software when using untrusted networks
like WLAN hot spots, I've described the benefits of using your home network's
Web proxy rather than surfing the Web directly through the untrusted network.
From a policy-enforcement standpoint, this allows you to enforce whatever URL
or content filtering with which your home network's proxy is configured; from an
endpoint-security standpoint, it makes phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks
harder.
</p><p>
On the downside, it also results in a somewhat slower Web browsing experience,
because each user's Web traffic must traverse a longer, slower path than without
the VPN tunnel in place. Also, making remote users use your corporate Web proxy
without also configuring them to use your corporate DNS servers may fail to
prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (in which DNS redirection is a common
technique), giving a false sense of security. 
</p><p>
I return to the DNS problem shortly, but how do you use Web proxies with
OpenVPN? It's quite simple. On the Web proxy itself, you simply need to make
sure there's an Access Control List (ACL) allowing client connections from
tunnel IPs. This is a moot question if your Squid server is running on a
different box from the OpenVPN server, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the OpenVPN server is using
Network Address Translation (NAT) to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; all tunnel-originated packets
behind its own IP address (I discuss NAT shortly). 
</p><p>
If, however, you are running the Web proxy on the OpenVPN server itself, you
need an ACL. For Squid, you need to add something like this to
/etc/squid/squid.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
acl openvpn_tunnels src 10.31.33.0/24
http_access allow openvpn_tunnels
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >acl</tt> line defines an object named
<tt  >openvpn_tunnels</tt>, representing
transactions whose source IP addresses fall between 10.31.33.1 and
10.31.33.254. The <tt  >http_access</tt> line allows transactions initiating from this
IP range. As with any other change you make to this file, you need to
restart Squid for this ACL to take effect (<tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/squid
restart</tt>).
</p><p>
Your clients will, of course, need to be configured to use your Web proxy, but
they target the same IP address regardless of whether they're connecting from
afar via OpenVPN or connecting directly to your LAN. That is, if you're already
having your users proxy all their Web traffic, no change to their Web browser
settings should be necessary for them to use the same proxy through OpenVPN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x29550d0"></a>
Enforcing DNS</h2></div></div><p>
If you're requiring all remote users to route all their Internet traffic
through the VPN tunnel, it isn't enough to force them to use the remote
network's default gateway. You also need to force them to use the remote
network's DNS servers. Otherwise, a man-in-the-middle attack that involves DNS
spoofing on the client side of the tunnel will succeed. Once a remote user's
browser has been handed a phishing site's IP address for a given URL, it
doesn't matter whether it connects to that IP directly or through the VPN
tunnel (unless, perhaps, the phishing site's IP address is on a blacklist
enforced by your corporate Web proxy or firewall).
</p><p>
If your remote clients all run Windows, it's easy to enforce server-side DNS
settings. Simply add the following line to your OpenVPN server's OpenVPN
configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
push "dhcp-option DNS 10.0.0.100"
push "dhcp-option DNS 10.0.0.120"
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you should replace 10.0.0.100 and 10.0.0.120 with the addresses
of the DNS servers you want your clients to use.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, this won't work for non-Windows clients. For Linux and other
UNIX clients, you'll need to edit those client systems' /etc/resolv.conf files
either manually or dynamically. The server-side configuration parameter
<tt  >foreign_option_&lt;I&gt;n&lt;I&gt;</tt> lets you pass data to tunnel-initiation scripts
(<tt  >--up</tt> scripts); for example, the line <tt  >foreign_option_1='dhcp-option DNS
10.0.0.100'</tt> sends the line <tt  >dhcp-option DNS
10.0.0.100</tt> to any defined &ldquo;up&rdquo;
scripts, which can then act on that data.
</p><p>
The details of how all this works are out of the scope of this article. Suffice it
to say that the OpenVPN man page describes how &ldquo;up&rdquo; scripts work, and the link
to the update-resolv-conf script in the Resources for this article provides a script
you can alter to rewrite /etc/resolv.conf to give precedence to your
&ldquo;home&rdquo;
network's DNS servers. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2463580.0x2955650"></a>
NAT and iptables on the OpenVPN Server</h2></div></div><p>
There's one more critical step necessary to allow remote users to route packets
to the Internet through their VPN tunnels. You need to set up Network Address
Translation (NAT) so that traffic entering your &ldquo;home&rdquo; network from VPN tunnels
appears to originate from the OpenVPN server. 
</p><p>
This is because the networks from which remote clients connect will have
either different network IP addresses than your &ldquo;home&rdquo; network, in which case the odds
are your &ldquo;home&rdquo; network infrastructure won't have a route to the remote
clients, or they'll have the same network IP addresses, in which case it's
quite possible that different hosts on opposite ends of the VPN tunnels will
have the <span   class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> host IP addresses!
</p><p>
Note that this problem plays out differently on &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; (Layer 2) VPN
tunnels than on &ldquo;routing&rdquo; (Layer 3) VPN tunnels. Because all my examples so far
have involved a routing VPN scenario, what I'm about to say regarding NAT applies
to routed VPN tunnels.
</p><p>
So, the way to sidestep the problem of foreign IP addresses on
remote clients' packets completely is simply to rewrite all packets entering the OpenVPN
server's local network with the OpenVPN server's local IP address. To do so,
add just one firewall rule, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING 
 &#8618;-s 10.31.33.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that as with any other time you execute the command
<tt  >iptables</tt>, this is
not a persistent change. To make this rule persistent across reboots, you
need to add an equivalent line to whatever configuration file or script
controls firewalling on your OpenVPN server.
</p><p>
The OpenVPN man page has an entire section on firewalls (called
&ldquo;FIREWALLS&rdquo;)
that contains lots of good information about managing iptables firewall rules
on your OpenVPN server. Remember, any VPN server is a security device. It's a
good idea to run not just a single NAT rule, but a detailed set of filtering
rules that restrict how people can connect to the server and to what systems
your VPN clients may connect.
</p><p>
(Speaking of iptables, it's been a long time since I covered Linux's powerful
firewall capabilities in this column. Look for an in-depth article on writing
your own Linux firewall rules in a future column.)

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article and my previous four columns covered Virtual Private Network
principles and architectures; described a few VPN technologies available for
Linux and how SSL/TLS solutions differ from IPsec; covered OpenVPN server
configuration, including how to generate and manage digital certificates; and
described client configuration and usage; all for a simple remote-access usage
scenario.
</p><p>
With all of that plus the practical use details I covered this month, you
should be well on your way to a secure remote-access VPN solution using
OpenVPN. If you decide to use OpenVPN instead or additionally to build
network-to-network VPNs or to do a &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; OpenVPN solution, the OpenVPN
man page, HOWTO and FAQ should make more sense to you now than they would have
before reading these articles&mdash;all of which means, you no longer have any excuse to surf the Web through
insecure wireless hot spots without protection!
