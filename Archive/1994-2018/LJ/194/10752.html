Port scans aren't just for script kiddies and network
troubleshooting. You also can use them to scan your network for clients and
build your server configs dynamically.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ab0580.0x1ba8408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The great thing about tools is that you often can misuse them for a
completely different purpose. The end of a screwdriver makes a passable
hammer; a butter knife can be a screwdriver, and even a paper clip can
substitute for a key in a pinch. Normally, you probably think of nmap as a security
tool. After all, it's ideal when you want to test a machine for open,
vulnerable ports. The other day though, I realized nmap had another
use&mdash;a
way to scan my network and build a dynamic configuration file based on what
machines replied to my scan.

Munin Is Trendy</h2></div></div><p>
This whole project started when I decided to deploy Munin across my servers
so I could graph trending data for each machine on my network. Munin is a
great tool for trending, because once you install the agent, it often
will discover what services and statistics to monitor and graph
automatically.
The downside for me though was that I already had a network full of
servers. It was bad enough that I had to install an agent on each machine,
but I also had to build a giant configuration file on my Munin server by
hand that listed each server it should monitor. Plus, any time I added a
machine to the network, I had yet another step in my build process as I had
to add that new server to my Munin config.
</p><p>
I'm a big fan of automation, and I figured there must be some easier way to
add all my machines to this file. When you look at a Munin configuration
file, it seems ripe for automation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dbdir   /var/lib/munin
htmldir /var/www/munin
logdir  /var/log/munin
rundir  /var/run/munin
tmpldir /etc/munin/templates

[web1.example.net]
        address web1.example.net

[web2.example.net]
        address web2.example.net

[db1.example.net]
        address db1.example.net

[db2.example.net]
        address db2.example.net
</pre>
</p><p>
The syntax for a generic munin.conf file is pretty straightforward. First, a
few directories are defined, and then each server is defined within a pair
of brackets. Inside those brackets, you can assign a name to the server or
just use the hostname. After that, the following line lists the hostname or
IP address for that server. In the above example, I've defined four servers.
</p><p>
If I wanted to generate this configuration file automatically, I had to
figure out some way to detect what servers were running Munin on my
network. Munin makes this simple though, because each server has a Munin
agent listening on port 4949 by default. All I had to do was use nmap to
scan the network and list all the machines that had port 4949 open. I
figured I could parse that output and append it to my munin.conf file,
and then maybe make a vim macro to go through each line and format it.

Nmap with Grepable Output</h2></div></div><p>
The first step was to find the right nmap syntax so that it would scan my
network and list all machines that were listening to port 4949. First, I
tried the standard command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nmap -p 4949 10.1.1.0/24

Starting Nmap 4.11 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) 
 &#8618;at 2010-03-01 20:18 PST

Interesting ports on 10.1.1.1:
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
4949/tcp closed unknown
MAC Address: 00:00:0C:01:CD:05 (Cisco Systems)

Interesting ports on purple1.example.net (10.1.1.50):
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
4949/tcp closed unknown
MAC Address: 08:00:20:CF:9D:D7 (SUN Microsystems)

Interesting ports on web1.example.net (10.1.1.53):
PORT     STATE SERVICE
4949/tcp open  unknown
MAC Address: 00:50:56:92:34:02 (VMWare)

Interesting ports on web2.example.net (10.1.1.67):
PORT     STATE SERVICE
4949/tcp open  unknown
MAC Address: 00:30:48:A0:12:98 (Supermicro Computer)
. . .
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, for each machine that nmap finds, it lists the IP, whether
the port is open, and even tries to identify the type of machine. Even
though you could grep out the machines with open ports from this output, it
would be quite a pain to parse everything with the multiline
output. Instead, I used the -oG argument to nmap, which tells it to output
in &ldquo;grepable format&rdquo;, along with the - argument, which tells it to send that
output to STDOUT. The result was much simpler to parse:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nmap -oG - -p 4949 10.1.1.0/24
# Nmap 4.11 scan initiated Mon Mar  1 20:26:45 2010 as: 
 &#8618;nmap -oG - -p 4949
# 10.1.1.0/24 
Host: 10.1.1.1 ()      Ports: 4949/closed/tcp/////
Host: 10.1.1.50 (purple1.example.net)    Ports: 4949/closed/tcp/////
Host: 10.1.1.53 (web1.example.net)       Ports: 4949/open/tcp/////
Host: 10.1.1.67 (web2.example.net)       Ports: 4949/open/tcp/////
. . .
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I could just grep for &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and I'd get a list of all machines running
Munin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nmap -oG - -p 4949 10.1.1.0/24 | grep open
Host: 10.1.1.53 (web1.example.net)     Ports: 4949/open/tcp/////
Host: 10.1.1.67 (web2.example.net)     Ports: 4949/open/tcp/////
</pre>

Perl to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
Once I started working on the regular expressions to parse through this
output and generate the syntax I needed, I realized I should ditch vim and
just write a script that built the entire configuration file for me and run
that script with cron. That way, I'd never have to add a new server again.
The only challenge was that I had multiple subnets I wanted to scan, and I
discovered that sometimes nmap didn't resolve the IP addresses into
hostnames for me. Listing 1 shows the resulting script.

my $munin_config = 'munin.conf';
my $munin_config_temp = 'munin.conf.tmp';
my $node_port = '4949';
my $nmap = "nmap -oG - -p ";

      }

      $munin_hosts{$host} = $ip;
   }
   close NMAP;
}

# output to a temp file in case munin

# then print out the config for each host
foreach $host (sort keys %munin_hosts){
   print OUTFILE "\[$host\]\n\taddress $host\n";
   # add any extra munin options for each host here
   print OUTFILE "\n";
}
close OUTFILE;

system("mv $munin_dir/$munin_config_temp $munin_dir/$munin_config");
</pre></div><p>
Other than the hashes and a little fun with regular expressions, the bulk
of this script is basic Perl. Once I tested it a few times by hand and was
comfortable with it, I went ahead and copied the script into
/etc/cron.daily. Of course, on my real network, I've added a few other fancy
touches. For instance, every server on my network has a DNS TXT record that
says what the server does. It is a useful practice for many reasons, but in
this case, I found that because I used the same TXT record for similar
servers, I could look it up and use that to group servers together under
that heading.
</p><p>
Although this script worked great for Munin configs, you also could use the
same procedure to scan for any number of services and build a
configuration. I could see scripts that generate configuration files for
Nagios, programs that poll SNMP or any other program that monitors
multiple servers over a known port.
