It's not Linux, but MINIX can introduce you to the basic
concepts without all the baggage.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ca580.0x12c23b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Remember MINIX? Short for Minimal UNIX, MINIX is a close cousin of
GNU/Linux. To GNU/Linux users, it is simultaneously familiar and foreign,
and it challenges orthodox assumptions about how an operating system should
be designed.
</p><p>
MINIX originally was developed in 1987 by Andrew S. Tanenbaum as a teaching
tool for his textbook <span   class="emphasis"><em>Operating Systems Design and
Implementation</em></span>. Today,
it is a text-oriented operating system with a kernel of less than
6,000 lines of code. MINIX's largest claim to fame is as an example of a
microkernel, in which each device driver runs as an isolated user-mode
process&mdash;a structure that not only increases security but also
reliability, because it means a bug in a driver cannot bring down
the entire system.
</p><p>
In its heyday during the early 1990s, MINIX was popular among hobbyists
and developers because of its inexpensive proprietary license. However,
by the time it was licensed under a BSD-style license in 2000, MINIX
had been overshadowed by other free-licensed operating systems.
</p><p>
Today, MINIX is best known as a footnote in GNU/Linux history. It inspired
Linus Torvalds to develop Linux, and some of his early work was written
on MINIX. Probably too, Torvalds' early decision to support the MINIX
filesystem is responsible for the Linux kernel's support of almost every
filesystem imaginable.
</p><p>
Later, Torvalds and Tanenbaum had a frank e-mail debate
about the relative merits of macrokernels and microkernels. This
early history resurfaced in 2004 when Kenneth Brown of the Alexis
de Tocqueville Institution prepared a book alleging that Torvalds
borrowed code from MINIX&mdash;a charge that Tanenbaum, among others,
so comprehensively debunked, and the book was never actually
published (see Resources).
</p><p>
Now at version 3.1.6, MINIX has taken a turn in its development. While
versions 1 and 2 focused primarily on the operating system as a learning
tool, with version 3, MINIX began targeting low-cost laptops and embedded
devices as well. More generally, the project's Web page recommends
MINIX for &ldquo;applications where very high reliability is
required&rdquo; and for
projects where the GNU General Public License would be too restrictive.
</p><p>
However, these new targets seem more ideal than real. I can find
little evidence of MINIX being used in embedded devices or for
its high reliability or licensing. Similarly, MINIX still lacks the
user-friendliness that would make it a candidate for a project like
One Laptop Per Child. As with previous releases, MINIX's greatest value
continues to be as an educational aid to give users experience of another
UNIX-like system.
</p><p>
Still, for those familiar with GNU/Linux, MINIX does take some
acclimatization. Accordingly, what I present here is not a comprehensive
review, but an introduction to help those who are interested in orienting
themselves to MINIX, its structure and resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ca580.0x12c28d8"></a>
Installing MINIX</h2></div></div><p>
MINIX's hardware requirements
(see Resources) should not
be a major concern for most users. Requiring 16MB of RAM and
a gigabyte of hard drive space, MINIX should install on most computers
made in the last decade, even if all peripheral devices are not supported.
</p><p>
If you are interested mainly in studying MINIX, you might consider
installing it in a virtual machine. MINIX is installable with a variety of
virtualization solutions, including Bosch, QEMU, VMware and VirtualBox.
Instructions for each solution are available on the project Web
site. Installing MINIX as a guest operating system has the advantage of
allowing you to make easy comparisons with a GNU/Linux host.
</p><p>
No matter how you decide to install MINIX, have some paper ready to take
notes. Some on-line instructions are available, but, at the time of this
writing, they
differ so significantly from those provided by the installer that they
are not reliable. The first set of instructions (Figure 1) is especially
important because
it explains the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
That you install with the setup command.
</p></li><li><p>
How to shut down the system.
</p></li><li><p>
That you use xdm to start the X Window System.
</p></li><li><p>
That you use packman to install additional packages.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
What the instructions do not mention is that you can log in after installation
as the root user with no password.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10754f1.large.jpg"><img src="10754f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Bootup Instructions
</p></div></div><p>
Although text-based, the MINIX installer should provide few obstacles
for anyone who has installed operating systems in the past. Probably the
biggest standard challenge is to do expert partitioning, because MINIX has
its own system. However, the default partition scheme, which includes
separate partitions for /, /home and /usr, should be satisfactory for
most users.
</p><p>
A more serious problem for some people will be the fact that MINIX
supports only eight common Ethernet cards; the installer does, however,
auto-detect cards.
</p><p>
True to its name, MINIX installs a minimal system. One of the installer's
final warnings is that the first time you start the new
installation, you should add users and passwords.
</p><p>
If you are installing on a multiboot system, you also need to
add MINIX to the bootloader. For example, if you are using Legacy GRUB and MINIX
is installed on the second partition of the first hard drive, the
stanza in /boot/grub/menu.list would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title MINIX
rootnoverify (hd0,1)
chainloader +1
</pre>
</p><p>
As with Windows, GRUB does not support MINIX natively and has to pass
off its booting to MINIX's own bootloader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ca580.0x12c31c8"></a>
Navigating MINIX</h2></div></div><p>
MINIX remains a shell-based operating system, and its concessions to
the desktop are minimal. It starts with a boot menu of different system
states, including (assuming you followed the install instructions) a pristine
version of the operating system that you can use for recovery. When you
are finished, the command <tt  >shutdown</tt> halts the system,
and <tt  >shutdown -r</tt>
reboots it.
</p><p>
For anyone who has used a UNIX-like system, the MINIX directory hierarchy
should be broadly familiar (Figure 2). However, you will notice a few missing
top-level directories, such as the ever-contentious /opt, and directories
added to operating systems like GNU/Linux for user-friendliness, such
as /cdrom and /media. Also missing is /proc, which tells you that the
pseudo-filesystem procfs does not exist to access process information
from the kernel. Because MINIX runs drivers in userspace, it does not
have the need for /proc that GNU/Linux does.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10754f2.large.jpg"><img src="10754f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. File Hierarchy
</p></div></div><p>
Descend a directory level, and you find that the logic of the directory
hierarchy is differently applied. For instance, GNU/Linux's /var/spool
directory, which contains queues for cron jobs, printing and mail as
well as locks, is located in /usr/spool instead. But, such examples are
exceptions, and previous experience with UNIX-like systems can only
benefit those exploring MINIX for the first time.
</p><p>
What may require more acclimatization is MINIX's naming system for devices. Open
/etc/fstab, and, if you accepted the default partitioning scheme during
installation, you will see something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root=/dev/c0d0p0s0
usr=/dev/c0d0p0s2
home=/dev/c0d0p0s1
</pre>
</p><p>
Although this naming system may seem intimidating at first, in practice,
it is very simple. It lists the physical controller and disk, followed by
the partition and sub-partition, with the first of each item numbered 0.
</p><p>
Naturally, other distinguishing characteristics of MINIX will
become clearer as you explore it in more detail. But if you do need
help, MINIX supports man pages, just like most UNIX-like systems, and it includes an interesting
application called whichman that attempts to find approximate matches
to a query. However, you will not find any info pages, despite the fact
that MINIX uses utilities provided by the GNU Project. You also can find
help on the MINIX Wiki, although it is not always up to date and often
suffers from a lack of detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ca580.0x12c37a0"></a>
Software Selection and Installation</h2></div></div><p>
When you install MINIX, the result is a minimal system (a setup that is
in keeping with basic security principles). If you want more,
you have to install it yourself. Beyond the basic system, MINIX has a small but
well-rounded collection of 135 packages, tailored to the needs of the
command line. By default, it uses the
ash shell, but BASH and zsh are also available. It includes support for
several programming languages, including Tcl, Perl, Python and FLTK,
and users can choose between vile, vim and nano for text editors.
</p><p>
Some of MINIX's applications, such as Kermit, might seem old-fashioned
from a modern GNU/Linux user's perspective. Others will seem thoroughly
contemporary, such as SQLite, OpenSSL and wget. Then, there are the
usual suspects, such as ImageMagick, tar and zip. You even can unwind
with a game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nethack</em></span> on MINIX. In keeping with MINIX's status as an
educational operating system, typing a command without any parameters
displays a brief summary of usage.
</p><p>
In MINIX, you won't find desktop applications, such as Firefox or
OpenOffice.org. Such programs are many times larger than the whole of
MINIX, and including them would go against the project's goals of
being suitable for embedded systems. Strangely enough, you will find a
package for The GIMP. But the closest you will find to Firefox is Lynx,
and the closest to OpenOffice.org is TeX.
</p><p>
For that matter, you will find little attention paid to graphical
interfaces in general. The X Window System is available, but the
interfaces are few. You can run TWM (Figure 4) for an extremely basic desktop, but
with the unaliased text, you are better off at the command prompt. The
Equinox Desktop Environment (Figure 3) is considerably more sophisticated, but unless you're doing something like viewing graphics, running any sort of
graphical interface in MINIX is mostly beside the point. Although you could
study the X Window System in MINIX, the overwhelming majority of the
work you might do in MINIX works just as well from the command line, if not better.

</p></div></div><p>
Whatever your choice of extras, they are installed with the command
<tt  >packman</tt>. Packman opens with a list of the available
packages (Figure 5).
Dependencies are not resolved automatically in packman, but the list informs you when
a package requires another one.

When you know what packages you want to install, press the q key, and
enter their numbers at the prompt (Figure 6).
When you are finished installing, press the q key twice to exit.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming you have experience with UNIX-like operating systems, you
shouldn't need more than a session or two to familiarize yourself with
MINIX and its resources.
</p><p>
If your interest is not just casual, your next step might be to read the
MINIX Developer's Guide. This
concise guide goes all the way from the resources you might need to
learn more about programming in MINIX to explaining the MINIX API
and packaging format in detail. Then, you might want to see what MINIX
projects are already organized on the project's Who Is Working On What
page and joining the
Google Group for MINIX.
Conversely, if you are considering using MINIX for teaching,
look at the Teaching with MINIX Web page for resources.
</p><p>
But is MINIX worth this effort? Is it, perhaps, a historical relic
whose best days are past? How you answer that is very much a matter
of perspective.
</p><p>
On the one hand, MINIX development and teaching are both relatively
small worlds, so individuals might expect (all else being equal)
to contribute to them more easily and meaningfully than to larger free and
open-source projects. MINIX development in particular seems to be at a
significant stage as the project tries to redefine its relevance. And,
there is something to be said about learning and teaching about UNIX-like
systems in a smaller, less-cluttered environment, especially one that
is not desktop-oriented.
</p><p>
On the other hand, some might consider MINIX (to be frank) a
dead end. Why, they might argue, should anyone put effort into such a
small project when working with GNU/Linux or FreeBSD is more relevant
today and promises to teach more marketable job skills?
</p><p>
Either way, MINIX is worth some attention. You may decide not to invest
a lot of time in MINIX, but after examining it in any detail, you will
probably return to your own free operating system of choice with a better
understanding of how it is structured. For all the efforts to refocus
MINIX, teaching is very much what it continues to do best.
