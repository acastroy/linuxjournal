<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #194, June 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul E. McKenney</b></span> has worked up a patch to include a more precise
<span   class="bold"><b>version number</b></span> in the config data, so if you're running a kernel built
from a git repository, you'll be able to identify the source
tree precisely, even if it's in between officially released versions. In this
case, the version number will look something like
2.6.33-01836-g90a6501. Isn't it beautiful? His code actually went
through numerous revisions to make sure it derived the version number
in a safe way that wouldn't cause other scripts to choke and to give
users the option of setting environment variables to control whether
full version information should be included.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Young</b></span> has posted patches to change the patch submission
documentation to list <span   class="bold"><b>Gmail</b></span> as no longer useful for sending patches.
In the past, Gmail apparently could be made to send patches cleanly by
jumping through a couple hoops, but now that's no longer the case.
Gmail converts tabs to spaces, automatically wraps long lines and
will 64-bit encode messages that have non-ASCII characters. Any one of
those features would be enough to corrupt a patch file. Now, it's
possible to configure <span   class="bold"><b>Firefox</b></span> to edit the e-mail with an external
editor, and in the past, Gmail would send the edited text instead of
using its own editor. But, with the introduction of the line-wrapping
feature, Gmail apparently wraps lines even when an external editor is
used. The documentation used to explain the workaround involving the
external editor, but Dave's patch now simply lists the various
issues and states that Gmail shouldn't be used for sending patches to
the <span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel mailing list</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric W. Biederman</b></span> has changed the way
<span   class="bold"><b>/dev/console</b></span> is created. The old
way was to wait until the filesystem containing the /dev directory had
been mounted and then mount /dev/console there. The problem with
that is if you ever want to unmount the filesystem, you can run
into problems if /dev/console is still open. Eric's patch mounts
/dev/console as part of <span   class="bold"><b>rootfs</b></span>&mdash;still in the same location, still
called /dev/console, but just as part of rootfs instead of whatever
filesystem you choose to mount for your running system. Very, very
few power users may have to adjust the way they do things slightly as
a result of this patch. Everyone else should notice nothing at all, or
they may notice in some situations, certain problems that
used to crop up don't anymore.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Christine Caulfield</b></span> has marked herself as no longer maintaining the
<span   class="bold"><b>DECnet</b></span> networking layer and has marked that code as orphaned instead
of maintained. With the decnet mailing list totally silent, her theory
is that the only users are running older kernels and are happy with
it as is. The DECnet networking protocols originally were used in the
1970s to connect <span   class="bold"><b>PDP-11s</b></span>. They were published as open standards, 
paving the way for Linux's DECnet implementation decades later.

<h2 class="title">Maintaining Your System from the Command Line</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #194, June 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many Linux distributions use some form of packaging system to organize
applications installed on a system. A formal packaging system
lets you install, remove and, in general, maintain your software 
in a controlled and coherent way. The three main packaging systems
that most distributions currently use
are the Debian deb package, the Red Hat rpm package and the Slackware pkg
package. They all have graphical utilities to interact with
the packaging system, but what if you want to deal with the system on the
command line? What if you're running a server or accessing a distant
machine through SSH and don't want to deal with the overhead of X11? Let's
look at how to do this for Debian-based systems.
</p><p>
First, you probably will want to install some software.
The preferred way to do this is with the apt-get utility.
apt-get is aware of the chain of dependencies between packages. If
you want to install stellarium, simply run
<tt  >apt-get install stellarium</tt>,
which downloads the relevant package file and all of its dependencies
from a repository. What if you don't know the exact package 
name? Use the dpkg-query utility to query the package management system. 
So, if you know the package name has &ldquo;kde&rdquo; in it, you can list
all the matching packages with <tt  >dpkg-query -l "*kde*"</tt>.
Remember, quote any search strings that have an asterisk (*), so you
don't inadvertently make the shell try to expand them.
</p><p>
This works great for software available in the given repository. But, what
if you want something not available? If you have a .deb file
available for download, you can download it and install it manually. After
downloading the file, install it by running <tt  >dpkg -i
file_to_install.deb</tt>.
</p><p>
dpkg works with the deb packaging system at a lower level than
apt-get. With it, you can install, remove and maintain individual packages.
If you have a group of packages to install, you might
want to add the relevant repository to your list so that apt-get knows
about it. The list of repositories is stored in the configuration file
/etc/apt/sources.list. Each line has the form:


<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main restricted
</pre>
</p><p>
The first field tells apt-get what is available at this repository: deb is
for binary packages and deb-src is for source packages. The second field is
the URL to the repository (here, the Ubuntu
repository). The third field is the repository name (in this case, the
repository for Ubuntu's karmic version). The last fields are the
sections from which to install packages. This example 
looks at the main and restricted sections when trying to install
applications or resolve dependencies.
</p><p>
Now that you have installed some applications, you probably want to
maintain and keep them updated, because every piece of software will have
bugs or security issues that come to light over time. Developers
always are releasing new versions to fix those issues and updating the
relevant packages in the repositories. To update the list of software and
versions on your system, run <tt  >apt-get update</tt>.
Once you've updated the list, tell apt-get to install the updates with
<tt  >apt-get upgrade</tt>.
If you want a list of what is about to be upgraded, add the 
<tt  >-u</tt> option:
<tt  >apt-get upgrade -u</tt>.
</p><p>
Sometimes, when a new version for a package comes out (like when 
a distribution releases a new version), the dependencies for said package
might change too. In such cases, a straight upgrade might be
confused, so use
<tt  >apt-get dist-upgrade</tt>. This command tries to deal with these changes in
dependencies intelligently, adding and removing packages as necessary.
</p><p>
What if you've installed a package just to try it out and don't want
it anymore? Remove a package with
<tt  >apt-get remove stellarium</tt>.
This removes all the files installed as part of the stellarium package, but
it leaves any configuration files intact and also doesn't deal
with any extra packages installed because stellarium depended on them. If
you want to remove a package completely, including all configuration files,
run <tt  >apt-get purge stellarium</tt>.
</p><p>
Installing and removing all this software can result in space-wasting cruft
accumulating on your system. To recover some space, run
<tt  >apt-get autoclean</tt>.
This removes the package .deb files from the local cache for
packages that no longer can be downloaded (mostly useless
packages). If you want to clean out the local cache completely and recover
more space, run <tt  >apt-get clean</tt>.
</p><p>
Although <tt  >remove</tt> and <tt  >purge</tt> will remove a package, what can you do about any
dependencies installed for this package? If you run <tt  >apt-get
autoremove</tt>, you can uninstall all packages that were installed as dependencies for
other packages and aren't needed anymore.
</p><p>
Another way of finding packages that are no longer needed is with the
deborphan utility. First, you need to install it, with <tt  >apt-get
install deborphan</tt>.
(Most distributions don't install it by default.) Once installed,
running it with no command-line options gives a list of all
packages in the libs and oldlibs sections that have no dependencies. Because no
other package depends on those packages, you safely can use apt-get to
remove or purge them. If you want to look in all sections, use the
<tt  >-a</tt> option. If you're trying to save space, ask deborphan to print
out the installed sizes for these orphan packages by using 
the <tt  >-z</tt> option. Then, you can sort them with
<tt  >deborphan -z -a | sort -n</tt>, which gives a list of packages you can safely uninstall, sorted by
installed size from smallest to largest. 
</p><p>
Each of the tools discussed above has many other 
options that you should research in the relevant man pages. Also, Red
Hat-based systems have equivalent commands
to help you manage rpm files.

Whether you think making each program have its own installer
is a bug or a feature, in the Windows world, it's the norm.
So, if you're porting open-source code to Windows, at some point, you
have to think about creating an installer.
</p><p>
Inno Setup is a free and open-source installer for Windows programs.
It's been around since 1997 and is written in Delphi Pascal.
Inno Setup is driven by a script that you provide, allowing
Inno Setup to create an installer for your program.
The script is much like an INI file. You provide simple
name/value pairs that drive the creation of the installer.
For more complex scenarios, Inno Setup contains its own built-in
Pascal compiler for creating real &ldquo;code&rdquo; sections in the script.
</p><p>
Inno Setup has a long list of supported features:
support for 64-bit applications, customizable setup types,
integrated uncompressing of installed files,
creation of shortcuts,
creation of registry entries,
running programs before/during/after the install,
password protection,
digital signing and much more.
See the Web site (<a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php" target="_self">www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</a>) for more information.
</p><p>
Inno Setup runs on all modern versions of Windows.
It creates an uninstaller as well as an installer
and packages it all up in a single EXE for easy distribution.
At the time of this writing, Inno Setup is at version 5.3.8, released February 18, 2010.

This is <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>'s Distribution issue, and it seems fair
to note that programs like GRUB aren't only for those of us with one foot
in the Windows world. Did you know you can run Fedora and Ubuntu on the
same machine? Did you know you can run Fedora 10, Fedora 12, Ubuntu 8.04,
Ubuntu 9.10, Slackware and Linux Mint all on the same machine?

</p><p>
One of the many great things about Linux is that it makes multiple
installs simple! During the install process, carve off a hunk of hard
drive, and most distributions happily will honor and respect your
existing GRUB install. So if you can't decide
which distribution you want to try, install them all! (Okay, if
you install 20 distributions on one computer, you may start to run into
problems keeping them straight!)

With the latest iteration of its Linux distribution, Canonical has
changed its branding a bit. Although we might all speculate why it has
moved on from its traditional brown themes, sadly the reality often
is less exciting than speculation. True, the rebranding is due to years
of planning, research and marketing decisions, but I suspect a strong
underlying set of reasons:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
UPS already had the corner of the brown market.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu's &ldquo;Human&rdquo; theme limited its interplanetary domination
strategy.
</p></li><li><p>
Mark Shuttleworth heard enough &ldquo;scat&rdquo; jokes as they pertain to
the color brown.
</p></li><li><p>
The color brown would clash with the upcoming orange overtones of the 10.10 version of Ubuntu, Marauding Marmaduke.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All joking aside, the rebranding is a refreshing new look for Ubuntu.
Whether it will have any effect on the marketability of Canonical's
flagship product remains to be seen. For those of us who were just
about browned-out though, I think it's safe to say, &ldquo;Bring on the
purple!&rdquo;

One glance at DistroWatch will prove that Linux users like to roll
their own distributions. Heck, there's even a distribution called
Linux From Scratch, which you'd think would just be called Linux!
If you have been itching to roll your own distribution but feared it
was too complicated, Reconstructor (<a href="http://www.reconstructor.org" target="_self">www.reconstructor.org</a>) might be exactly what you need.

</p><p>
I've written about Reconstructor before on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/reconstructor-when-you-lose-your-restore-cd" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/reconstructor-when-you-lose-your-restore-cd</a>),
and more recently, Ross Larson wrote a follow-up on how the project
has progressed (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/howto-customized-live-dvds-reconstructors-web-ui" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/howto-customized-live-dvds-reconstructors-web-ui</a>). One interesting new feature is that you can build
your own distribution from a Web-based distro builder. Surfing over to
<a href="http://build.reconstructor.org" target="_self">build.reconstructor.org</a> (and creating an account)
allows you
to build a custom Linux distribution and then download it.
</p><p>
I do have one request: please don't start a new Linux distribution to
compete with all the others. We already have plenty!
