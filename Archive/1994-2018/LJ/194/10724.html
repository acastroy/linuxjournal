Add one part GNU, one part Linux kernel, stir lightly,

It seems as though there are as many Linux distributions as there are
letters in the alphabet with which to name them. Certainly, there is
a flavor to satisfy almost any palate. It wasn't always this way, however.
How did it happen? Why hasn't the Linux world just standardized
on a single distribution?
</p><p>
The beginning of the Linux distribution really started with Richard
Stallman and his fledgling Free Software Foundation in the early 1980s. The
GNU operating system was being developed, intending to re-implement a
UNIX-like operating system as free software. Although many GNU tools
enjoyed wide use, the project suffered various setbacks and delays in
its hunt for a kernel. There was a lack of cooperation from some at
Berkeley with using the BSD kernel, and there were licensing issues
with Mach (Carnegie-Mellon University's microkernel). Before these
issues were resolved and the GNU Project was able to make headway building
its own kernel, Hurd (another free kernel) became available for use.
Then in 1991, the following message appeared on a Usenet newsgroup
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b?pli=1" target="_self">groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b?pli=1</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Hello everybody out there using minix-
</p><p>
I'm doing a (free) operating
system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486)
AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get
ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix,
as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system
(due to practical reasons) among other things). 
</p><p>
I've currently ported
bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that
I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know
what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but
I won't promise I'll implement them :-) 
</p><p>
Linus 
</p><p>
(PS. Yes - it's free of
any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable [sic]
(uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything
other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Linux provided a stopgap measure for the free kernel GNU needed to be
a complete operating system. Because Linux was no more and no less than
a kernel, it similarly needed tools like those provided by GNU and other
projects to be usable by anyone other than a developer. Early enthusiasts
put together bundles of software running on the Linux kernel, creating
the first distributions. These early distributions were mostly created
by universities for internal use, some releasing their handiwork to the
wider community.
</p><p>
With Linux 0.12, Linus announced his intention to license the kernel
under the GNU GPL (General Public License). Achieved by the release of
Linux 0.99, this removed the prior restriction on commercial distribution,
paving the way for commercially backed distributions that were soon to
come along.
</p><p>
One of those was Soft Landing Systems' SLS Linux, one of the first
widely used distributions. It was installable by floppy disk and included
such cutting-edge features as TCP-IP networking support and the X Window
System. SLS enjoyed popularity for the time, but it came under criticism
for being buggy and unstable. When Soft Landing Systems announced
it was going to change the default binary format from a.out to ELF,
it met with a very negative response from the user base. 
</p><p>
Among those
upset by Soft Landing Systems' decision was Patrick Volkerding, who then created a modified version of SLS he named
Slackware. The first release was July 16, 1993, and Slackware holds
the honor of being the oldest currently maintained Linux
distribution&mdash;by a few months.
</p><p>
Ian Murdock also became quite frustrated with the flaws he perceived in
SLS, and he announced on the newsgroup comp.os.linux.development on August
17, 1993 (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6" target="_self">groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new
Linux release, which I'm calling the Debian Linux Release. This is a
release that I have put together basically from scratch; in other words,
I didn't simply make some changes to SLS and call it a new release. I was
inspired to put together this release after running SLS and generally
being dissatisfied with much of it, and after much altering of SLS I
decided that it would be easier to start from scratch.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In the same year, Ian Murdock released the Debian Manifesto, detailing
his vision for a free and open distribution that would be developed and
maintained communally. He saw such a distribution as the way to
avoid stagnation, crucial to Linux's success in the commercial
market. The Free Software Foundation supported these efforts by funding
Debian development for a year.
</p><p>
Both Debian and Slackware were born of the dissatisfaction of not just the
problems with SLS but the closed nature of the distribution preventing any
improvements being submitted by the user base. Ian Murdock's solution
of having a distribution where many hands made light work of high standards
persists today, although Debian's development process has come under
criticism for its long release cycles.
</p><p>
Although Murdock built his solution on community involvement, Volkerding's
response was almost the polar opposite. The Slackware team did grow
to multiple developers; however, as late as 2000, all changes still were being
signed off personally by Volkerding as the project's &ldquo;czar&rdquo;. This, he
was recorded to have said, ensured that there was &ldquo;...a high level of
quality and consistency&rdquo; (from <a href="http://http://slashdot.org/interviews/00/03/17/1120205.shtml" target="_self">http://slashdot.org/interviews/00/03/17/1120205.shtml</a>).
</p><p>
Red Hat Linux was another of the successful early distributions. 
Marc Ewing was developing software for the UNIX platform but
turned to Linux as a more affordable option than a UNIX workstation. He
found after a time that rather than work on his main project, he spent the
majority of his time fixing issues with Linux. Marc eventually decided
to put his original project aside and &ldquo;...work on putting together a
better Linux distribution&rdquo; (<a href="http://http://www.salon.com/tech/view/1999/10/04/marc_ewing" target="_self">http://www.salon.com/tech/view/1999/10/04/marc_ewing</a>) as a business venture.
</p><p>
His first version took about a year and a half, and released in 1994. Bob
Young purchased most of the produced copies of the distribution
for ACC Corporation, a mail-order business that sold Linux- and
UNIX-related products, including distribution media. Not long after that, in 1995,
Young bought Ewing's business and merged it with ACC to become Red Hat
Software. That year, Red Hat 2.0 was released, including the then-new RPM
package management system. Four years later, Red Hat bought and merged
with Cygnus, becoming the largest open-source company in the world at
that time.
</p><p>
SuSE, standing for Software und System-Entwicklung in German (Software and
Systems Development), originally started as a software development and UNIX
consultancy company, consisting of its four founders Roland Dyroff, Thomas
Fehr, Burchard Steinbild and Hubert Mantel. Their original business plan
did not succeed, so SuSE moved on to distributing Linux. To start with,
SuSE provided software packages and services based on SLS. Once Patrick
Volkerding had created Slackware, SuSE began translating it into German.
</p><p>
For some time, SuSE continued to translate and distribute Slackware, but
for much the same reasons that Patrick Volkerding and Ian Murdock became
frustrated with SLS, SuSE grew dissatisfied with Slackware. Slackware's
closed development prevented SuSE from having its improvements and
changes accepted. Disappointed by bugs it was unable to fix, SuSE
decided to create its own Linux distribution.
</p><p>
The SuSE team identified a need for an easy-to-use installation and
configuration tool and started work on YaST, the core of modern SuSE
Linux. Over time, SuSE incorporated many features of Red Hat Linux,
including the RPM packaging system and the Red Hat-style rc system.
</p><p>
Of course, both Red Hat and SuSE exist in somewhat different forms
today. Red Hat eventually stopped supporting the free version of its
operating system to focus on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with the Fedora
Project stepping in to maintain the community-focused distribution. SuSE
Linux went through a similar change not long after being acquired by
Novell, with OpenSUSE rising as a new free and open flavor. Slackware and
Debian have navigated the years more or less intact, with Ian Murdock's
vision of Linux's commercial success realized not in Debian itself but
in the one who was yet to come&mdash;Ubuntu.
</p><p>
These are just the earliest distributions whose impact still clearly
can be seen in the Linux world, with all of them featured on DistroWatch's
top ten distributions list (albeit with the metamorphosized forms
Fedora and OpenSUSE). Many others were not as successful
but also played a part in shaping the early face of Linux&mdash;bonus
points to any readers who have been Linux users long enough to remember
MCC or Yggdrasil.
</p><p>
All four of the successful distributions had the common trait of 
providing a Linux distribution that was improved and easier to use,
and all four of the distros discussed here were frustrated with their efforts at trying to contribute
to the projects that had come before them.
Ultimately, the story behind our myriad Linux distributions is like that of Linux itself:
each was started by the most pragmatic kind of dreamer who could visualize a better way
and had the talent and drive to make that vision real.
