together have written the majority of the code in Samba, the
popular SMB (Windows Networking) file server for UNIX and UNIX-like
operating systems. Andrew, the creator of Samba, is currently a
Ph.D. student at the Australian National University. Jeremy
currently works for Whistle Communications Corporation, located in
Mountain View, California. Whistle provides Windows file sharing
services from the InterJet Internet appliance using Samba. Part of
Jeremy's job at Whistle is to develop and maintain Samba to make
sure it works properly on the InterJet. Before conducting this
interview I had &ldquo;met&rdquo; both Jeremy and Andrew through e-mail when
both provided a valuable commentary on my book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Samba:
Integrating UNIX and Windows</em></span>.

</p><p>This interview is dubbed <span   class="emphasis"><em>virtual</em></span> because
it didn't actually take place as printed. I interviewed Jeremy over
the telephone and his comments are taken nearly verbatim from the
tape of that conversation, though some changes were made in the
interest of readability. Andrew's comments were added via e-mail
after the fact.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: The &ldquo;history&rdquo; file
that accompanies Samba describes how Andrew wrote the precursor of
Samba by reverse-engineering the DEC Pathworks protocol using
packet dumps. Apparently he was motivated to do so because he had
become used to using PC-NFS to access his home directory on a Sun
machine, but couldn't run both the DEC Pathworks client and the
PC-NFS client at the same time. How did you get involved with
Samba, Jeremy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: At that time I was
working for Vantive. I was porting Vantive products to NT on the
quiet&mdash;they hadn't asked me to do it, but I knew it was something
they would need. At the time there was no PC-NFS client for NT so I
was actually doing the port using FTP. I would
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> the source files over, compile
them, then ftp them back. This was a massive pain. Around this same
time Andrew announced the SMB server 1.x&mdash;his second version. I
downloaded it to take a look. It was Andrew's first networking
program, I remember him saying, and it was a bit rough and
ready.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: I didn't realize
Jeremy looked at it so early. The first e-mails I got from Jeremy
were around December 1993 at around version 1.5.20. That was after
the nearly two-year gap when no work was done on the code by me or
anyone else. Version 0.1 was released around December 1991.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: I was actually
porting a network service that worked exactly the same way that
Samba does, so I started tightening up the networking code and
adding some stuff. Andrew had implemented Samba just by sniffing
the wire, because he's incredibly clever, where I can't do that
sort of thing without a specification. Since I had the X-Open
specification, I thought, why not extend this and implement Core
Plus? So, I basically added the Core Plus protocol, which put in
file locking and a whole bunch of other operations. That worked
well enough for me.</p><p>Then Andrew leap-frogged me again and put in the LanMan 1
protocol. We kind of leap-frogged each other, but neither of us
could figure out how to implement long file names, and we were
stuck there for a while.</p><p>Then I was browsing in a book shop in Mountain View and I
picked up a book on OS/2 programming, and it struck me that OS/2
already had to deal with this problem. Then I thought, this being
Microsoft, what if they just linearized the long file name
structures onto the wire? Well, worse things could happen, so I
decided to try it. Luckily, I came down with the flu for a week, so
I sat at home with my computer and it was one of those Zen
programming moments where you just code it up, try it and it
works&mdash;never before or since! Later on we found a few bugs, but for
the most part it worked.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Yeah, the
specification just said &ldquo;level-specific structures&rdquo; to describe
the structures. We didn't have the hang of the trans2 stuff which
was the real stumbling block. Once Jeremy coded up trans2.c, things
really got moving as we had the infrastructure needed to do all the
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; SMB features such as long file names. We worked a lot
with the OS/2 header files for a while and those really helped.
Jeremy contributed the trans2 code in October 1994 for version
1.8.0. This was a giant step forward.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: So, how accurate is
the official X-Open spec, from your experience?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: The actual Core
specification is pretty accurate up to the point where you get to
the OS/2 support. As soon as you go into the OS/2 areas of the
specification, it just disappears, and it's sort of like &ldquo;here be
dragons&rdquo; on a map.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Yeah, it just says
&ldquo;level-specific structures&rdquo; and leaves it at that. You do need to
remember that the main client (Windows) didn't have long file names
when the X-Open specification was written, so not putting it in is
not too unreasonable, particularly as a full description would be
huge.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: So the protocol is
just whatever they could get to work?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: Yeah, basically. The
protocol is really horrible. It sort of grew like a wart. You can
tell by looking at it. So, what happened was, once we got the long
file name support working, the next thing we wanted to get working
was encrypted password support. We hated having to put plaintext
passwords out. There was a &ldquo;magic constant&rdquo; that Microsoft
actually refused to give out to anybody. It's used in the DES
encryption for the LanMan password support. They refused to give it
to us without an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). We replied &ldquo;We're
not giving you an NDA, because we're publishing source.&rdquo;</p><p>There it sat for a while until I went to a Microsoft NT
conference up in Seattle and had a conversation with a, uhh, sort
of mentally challenged Microsoft person who was basically saying
&ldquo;Why do you want to break open all our LanMan system's?&rdquo;, and I
said &ldquo;I don't, I want to interoperate with them,&rdquo; which I suppose
to her was the same thing. So, she put me in touch with a Microsoft
programmer, Richard Ward, who is in charge of some of their
security stuff. I chatted with him, and he couldn't tell me what it
was, but he said, if you forward me a message I'll put you in touch
with somebody who knows more about it.</p><p>Now what happened&mdash;and this is really interesting&mdash;the
programmer he put me in touch with basically said, &ldquo;Well, what do
you need to know?&rdquo; I thought, well, if I ask him the question
directly, I won't get the answer. He'll say, &ldquo;I can't tell you
that.&rdquo; So, I phrased the question differently. The LanMan
encryption is a two stage operation, and we needed the middle bit.
I phrased the question in such a way that we could work backwards
from what he told us. I asked, if we encrypt this password, what
will the second stage be? Once he told us, it was trivial to
reverse it and out popped the magic constant. And once I had the
constant, I actually took a look at a hexdump of the Microsoft
redirector, and the magic constant is contained in a field of zeros
as plain as day.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: It actually took us
a day or two to realize that the information he sent gave us what
we needed. Jeremy and I both realized it independently within a few
hours of each other. It was an unexpected bonus!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: So it was easy to see
the magic constant once you knew where to look? [Note: the magic
constant is <b  >KGS!@#$%</b>.]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: Yeah, once you knew
where to look, but it did confirm that we knew exactly what it was.
So, it took a while getting the encrypted password stuff. I did all
the SMB password stuff, which I was a bit nervous about because
it's a <span   class="emphasis"><em>setuid</em></span> program and I never do like
writing setuid programs. After that I kind of left Samba alone for
quite a while, ended up moving to Cygnus to work on Kerberos. This
was when Volker (another Samba Team member and author of the SMB
file system for Linux) came on board, and when I finally came back
to it, Volker was asking &ldquo;who is this guy?&rdquo;, because I hadn't
worked on Samba for a while.</p><p>We went to a CIFS (Common Internet File System) conference
and Roger Binns, who wrote VisionFS (another SMB file server for
some UNIX systems written by SCO), said to me &ldquo;your share-mode
support is completely broken, did you know that?&rdquo; And I replied,
&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Right after that conversation, Herb Lewis at SGI started
doing some benchmarks, even going to Utah to benchmark Samba
against other programs such as the Syntax (VisionFS) code. Herb
made the remark, &ldquo;I can't get NetBench to run because I keep
getting share-mode violations.&rdquo; I remembered what Roger Binns had
told me so I started looking at the share-mode code. The code was a
tremendous piece of work, but it wasn't entirely safe&mdash;it only
stored one share mode for each open file. We now have a completely
correct share-mode implementation. So, in other words, we can have
multiple share-mode entries for each open file. Once I put all of
that code in&mdash;this is around 1.9.17, we could run NetBench. We got
reasonable results&mdash;they were okay&mdash;probably as good as
Syntax's.</p><p>At this time I realized that what we needed for performance
was <span   class="emphasis"><em>oplocks</em></span> (&ldquo;opportunistic locks&rdquo;). About
at the same time Herb, who's actually had a great effect on at
least my parts of Samba code, started complaining that his browsing
was broken&mdash;he couldn't make his browse lists be seen across
subnets. Luke (Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton&mdash;another Samba Team
member) had written all of that stuff and I had always thought it
worked. Basically, I went and played on SGI's network, and I
realized that there were things about the browsing that were
broken. So that's when I started being involved with the browser
stuff&mdash;I started fixing up Luke's code.</p><p>There have now been three implementations of the browser
code. The first was a single-threaded completely blocking one that
Andrew did which basically got it up and running. Then Luke took
that and turned it into an event-driven model that was truly an
amazing piece of work, very well done. But he was still learning
the protocol at the same time. So, I hacked up some of that code
section, and it sort of worked, but I realized that in order to
make it completely robust, I had to keep the same event model and
data structures but completely rewrite the code. So that was what I
ended up doing. That effort was actually spurred by the fact that
Whistle needed browsing to work correctly over semi-reliable links,
i.e., links that would go down periodically. I began by not
rewriting it&mdash;just fixing that particular bit, but I ended up
completely rewriting it. It was one of those things where, you
know, after a while you see you've completely rewritten something
without meaning to.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Actually the first
version wasn't completely blocking&mdash;it used recursion to simulate
some properties of threads (a <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> ugly
idea). It worked but could easily run out of stack. Luke's
implementation fixed that problem and also added a lot of new
code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: So, then, I knew the
oplock implementation was possible. I had a design for it, but
something like six months had passed before I actually had time to
sit down and do it. The oplock code is probably the most
complicated part of Samba right now.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: It's probably the most
complicated part of Windows networking.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: Well, yeah. That
took a long time to get right. Typical with SMB, there were a lot
of ugly implementation details that aren't in the specification.
For example, when someone does an open that needs to break an
oplock, do you check deny modes first? Now, logic would dictate
that you do, because if the deny modes disallow you from opening
the file then there's no need to check the oplock. It turns out if
you do that everything breaks. My first implementation did that as
an optimization because I thought, well, this will be really fast.
It turns out if you do that a bunch of programs break because a lot
of the Windows 95 redirector internals expect that a file could be
opened twice and the second open would cause the oplock to break
even though it's still going to get a share-mode violation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Do you suppose the
people that wrote that were optimizing for their own server
code?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: I don't know.
Previously they had only tested against their own server. Probably
there are a really weird bunch of hacks in there that work against
their own server and that we have to emulate. Of course, whenever
the redirector is broken and it doesn't work with Samba, people say
that Samba is broken.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: To change the
conversation a little bit, are you paid by Whistle just to work on
Samba or do you have other responsibilities?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: I have other
responsibilities, although getting Samba working has been a big
part of my job. One of the issues right now is that Samba works
well enough for Whistle, so I might actually have to work on some
other programs. However, I really do love to work on extending
Samba. My current plans for 1.9.19 are to do NT SMB, which will
implement <span   class="emphasis"><em>change notify</em></span> and many other
options. One of the things Whistle did that was actually very good
is they drove me into doing dynamic internationalization support
for Samba.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Any final
comments?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: One more thing that
you should include&mdash;my wife is the product marketing manager for
Network Appliance, a company that makes an SMB implementation. So,
my wife and I are in direct competition along with Samba and
Network Appliance, which is really amusing. She gives sales
training which includes a competitive analysis of Samba. She says
people always ask, &ldquo;What kind of freaks write this stuff and then
give it away?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: That reminds me of
conversations where I'm trying to explain the GPL. It took me a
while to fully internalize it and understand its implications, and
explaining it is a long conversation&mdash;sort of like explaining a
political theory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy</b></span>: Yes, it's a
revolutionary idea. Like most revolutionary ideas it will end up
changing the world, and it takes a while to get. I won't release
software under any other license now. I did before, and I've always
considered it a mistake and regretted making it. The
<span   class="bold"><b>pwdump</b></span> stuff I released under the
BSD license, and I wish I hadn't now. I see that code reused by
other people, but because of the license I don't get to see how
they're using it&mdash;they don't have to give back.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Andrew, why did you
choose to release Samba under the GPL?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: I didn't at first!
Server-0.1 and all versions prior to 1.5 were under a &ldquo;if you want
to use this for commercial purposes then contact me&rdquo;
license.</p><p>Version 1.5 came out after the 2-year break and after I had
started using Linux. I was impressed with Linux and chose the GPL
not because I understood it (I didn't) but because it was what
Linux used. Now that I understand the GPL I'm very glad I chose it.
It encourages just the sort of development effort that is needed
for Samba.</p></div></div>
