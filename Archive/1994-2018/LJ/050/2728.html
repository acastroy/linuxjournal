    To help you get connected,
    we have an article about a GUI that makes setting up PPP
    easy, as well as articles explaining how to set up PLIP, NFS, NIS and

To help you get connected, we have an article about a GUI that
makes setting up PPP easy, as well as articles explaining how to
set up PLIP, NFS, NIS and qmail. I think you will find something of
interest in each of them.
</p><p>We are also fortunate to have an article from Peter Braam
about the CODA file system with excellent illustrations by Gaich
Muramatsu. Also, John Blair interviewed the Samba team for us to
find out what's new in that arena.</p><p>The Silicon Valley Linux User's Group scored a coup by having
Linus Torvalds as their guest speaker in March. Chris DiBona not
only wrote it up for us, but sent along pictures too.</p><p>Next month also promises to be a great issue. Our focus will
be Science and Engineering, and I think you may be surprised at
some of the places Linux is being used to do research around the
world. For example, Linux is being used in high-energy nuclear
studies being done in Geneva by CERN and in ocean surface studies
by the British Antarctic Survey.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110d580.0x12053f8"></a>Upcoming Events</h2></div></div><p>A couple of events not to miss are coming up. Linux Expo
looks to be bigger and better than ever. The list of speakers found
at their web site, http://www.linuxexpo.org/, is quite impressive.
Linux Expo will be held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, May
28-30.</p><p>Then June 15-19 there will be the 23rd Annual USENIX
Technical Conference held in New Orleans, Louisiana. Now there's a
fun place to hold a technical conference. For details, see their
web page at http://www.usenix.org/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110d580.0x1205558"></a>Lottery Problem</h2></div></div><p>In our April issue, James Shapiro posed a problem concerning
the best way to accept lottery winnings in his article &ldquo;Financial
Calculation Programs for Linux&rdquo;. We feel we've kept you in
suspense long enough, so the answer to that problem is included
here (see sidebar).</p><p><a href="2728s1.html" target="_self">Lottery Answer</a></p></div></div>
