    Having problems setting up PPP? Mr. Meyers gives us a
    graphical interface to make it easy.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe54580.0xf4c500"></a></h2></div></div><p>PPP, the Point-to-Point Protocol, is
today's protocol of choice for network connectivity over a serial
line. For Linux users, the tools of choice are the PPP utilities.
The utilities&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> and a collection of scripts
and utilities&mdash;nicely manage the connection from startup to
shutdown: dialing and logging in, starting up the protocol, adding
routing information and closing the connection.
</p><p>What the PPP utilities do not have is a good user interface.
If you use the utilities, you know the routine: execute a script
called something like /etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-on, listen to your modem
make noise and wait while your network connection attempts to start
working. If nothing happens, check the process list. If pppd isn't
running, the login attempt failed and you need to try again. If the
connection goes down, you eventually figure it out by checking the
process list and starting a new connection. Things improve after
you've used the PPP utilities awhile&mdash;you begin to recognize the
state of the connection by the sounds of disk activity.</p><p>PPPui was written out of my frustration with the utilities'
low-tech interface. It's an X-based (specifically, Tcl/Tk-based)
GUI that provides very simple control over a PPP connection. The
goal was to provide easy startup and shutdown and useful visual
feedback about the connection.</p><p>The scenario for a PPPui session looks something like
this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Start PPPui. I've defined a window manager action,
described below, that makes this a one-click operation.</p></li><li><p>A window comes up and reports the progress of the
login process. If login fails, the window disappears and you must
try again.</p></li><li><p>Once login succeeds and the PPP route is added,
PPPui displays a running clock of your connect time. The clock is
visible even when you iconify PPPui.</p></li><li><p>To terminate the connection, press PPPui's &ldquo;Quit&rdquo;
button.</p></li></ul></div><p>PPPui is implemented as a
<span   class="bold"><b>wish</b></span> (WIndowing SHell&mdash;part of the
Tcl/Tk package) script and requires wish4.2. It does not replace
the PPP utilities, but does require some very minor changes to
them&mdash;discussed later in detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe54580.0xf4cb88"></a>A Look at the Program</h2></div></div><p>The PPPui script was developed on a Slackware system using
the PPP utilities source distribution. In the following description
and in the script itself, there are assumptions about locations
(scripts and executables) and permissions that do not necessarily
apply to other distributions. The script takes two required
arguments and two optional arguments. The basic invocation takes a
PPP startup command, a PPP shutdown command and optionally the name
of the PPP device being opened (defaults to
<b  >ppp0</b>). For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PPPui /etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-on\
        /etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-off ppp0
</pre><p>The startup and shutdown commands are interpreted by /bin/sh
when they are invoked and can contain multiple arguments and
anything else the shell will recognize. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PPPui /etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-on\
        '/etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-off ppp0' ppp0
</pre>


The other optional argument, <b  >-small</b>, is
described in the section &ldquo;Interacting with the Window Manager&rdquo;.
</p><p>After parsing the command line, PPPui sets the shell command
to use when interpreting startup and shutdown commands. It then
sets up a simple GUI containing a label, a &ldquo;quit&rdquo; button and a
scrolled text console for displaying status information. PPPui also
sets up a named pipe to the console, whose purpose is explained in
the section &ldquo;Changes Required in PPP Utilities&rdquo;, and it initiates
the startup command and captures the output. After setup, PPPui's
most important job is to wait around for something to happen. Here
are the things it is waiting for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The startup command generates output or output is
received through the named pipe. The output is captured by
HandleStartOutput{} or HandleFIFOInput{} (respectively) and sent to
the console by calling ToConsole{}.</p></li><li><p>The PPP connection is established. PPPui calls
CheckPPPDevice{} every 1/2 second to examine the contents of
/proc/net/route until a route appears for the device (the third
argument to the script names the device). Once the route appears,
PPPui starts a running display of the connect time, calling
PostTime{} once a second to update the clock. The clock is
displayed in the label at the upper-left corner of the GUI and also
in the window's title. This allows the clock to be visible even
when the window is iconified.</p></li><li><p>The user asks to close the connection by pressing
the &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; button or closing the window. PPPQuit{} is called to
invoke the shutdown command. After the invocation, PPPui resumes
waiting. Any output from the shutdown command is captured by
HandleStopOutput{} and sent to the console.</p></li><li><p>The startup command terminates. This is usually in
response to execution of the shutdown command, but can also occur
if the connection dies or the login fails. The death of the startup
command results in an EOF condition detected by
HandleStartOutput{}, at which point PPPui terminates and its window
disappears.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe54580.0xf4d1b8"></a>Changes Required in PPP Utilities</h2></div></div><p>PPPui works with the existing PPP utilities as
is&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span>. There is one required change and
one optional change to effect the interface from the utilities to
PPPui:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Required: The startup script must not terminate
until the connection is closed. Normal pppd behavior is to run in
the background as a daemon&mdash;this does not work for use with PPPui.
You need to add the <b  >-detach</b> option to the
invocation of pppd in the <span   class="bold"><b>ppp-on</b></span>
script. In my version of ppp-on, based on the 2.2.0f distribution
of the PPP utilities, the pppd invocation appears thus:
<pre     class="programlisting">
     exec /usr/sbin/pppd debug lock modem crtscts\
     /dev/modem 38400 asyncmap 20A0000 escape FF\
     kdebug 0 -detach $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP\
     noipdefault netmask $NETMASK defaultroute\
     connect $DIALER_SCRIPT
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Optional: The chat program, which handles the
dialing and login responsibilities, has the option of logging all
text received from the remote modem to stderr&mdash;that is, to display
what you would see if you were logging in from a terminal. If this
option is enabled with the <b  >-V</b> command, the
resulting stderr provides a nice display of the progress of the
login, which would be useful feedback on the PPPui console.
Unfortunately, chat's stderr is eaten by pppd for logging purposes.
So PPPui provides an alternate route to the console: a named pipe
whose name it advertises through the <b  >PPPUI_PIPE</b>
environment variable. By adding <b  >-V</b> to the chat
invocation and redirecting stderr to the named pipe, you capture
the login sequence on the console. An excerpt from my version of
the <span   class="bold"><b>ppp-on-dialer</b></span> script:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
     if [ "$PPPUI_PIPE" != "" ] ;
     then exec 2&gt;"$PPPUI_PIPE" ; fi
     exec /usr/sbin/chat -V
</pre><p><a href="2491f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. PPPui
Screen Dump</b></span></a></p><p>Figure 1 is a screen dump of PPPui taken ten seconds after I
established a connection with Teleport, my ISP in Portland. The
login sequence is captured in the console, and the clock ticks away
in the upper left corner and on the title bar. If I iconify the
client, the running clock appears with the icon or in the task bar
(depending on your choice of window manager).</p><p>What about security and permissions? One more change to the
utilities seems appropriate, and it is addressed in the sidebar,
<a href="2491s1.html" target="_self">&ldquo;PPP Security and Those Pesky Run-Only
Scripts&rdquo;</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe54580.0xf4d9a0"></a>Interacting with the Window Manager</h2></div></div><p>By adding a PPPui action to the window manager, you can make
starting your PPP connection a one-click operation. I use
<span   class="bold"><b>FVWM</b></span>95 as my manager; this line in
my .fvwm95rc adds PPP startup to the
<span   class="bold"><b>FvwmButtons</b></span> panel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*FvwmButtons(Title 'teleport', \
Action 'Exec "Teleport Connect" \
PPPui -name "Teleport Connect" \
"/etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-on" \
"/etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-off" ppp0 &amp;')
</pre><p>PPPui has an additional option to facilitate interaction with
FVWM95. The <b  >-small
<i><tt>windowname</tt></i></b> argument causes the
following two operations to occur after the connection is
established:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The console is unmapped and the clock and quit
button repacked into a very small area.</p></li><li><p>The window title is changed to the window name
specified as part of the option.</p></li></ol></div>

</p><p>To support the &ldquo;swallowing&rdquo; function of
<span   class="bold"><b>FvwmButtons</b></span>, the following entry
is needed in .fvwm95rc:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*FvwmButtons(Title 'teleport', Swallow \
        (Useold Respawn) "pppui_swallow"\
        Nop, Action 'Exec PPPui -name \
        "Teleport Connect" -small pppui_swallow\
        "/etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-on" \
        "/etc/ppp/scripts/ppp-off" ppp0 &amp;')
</pre><p>It creates an invocation of PPPui that is swallowed into the
button panel after the connection is established, as shown in
Figure 2. (Unfortunately, the semantics of FvwmButtons cause the
button to appear in a constantly-pressed state when the connection
is not active, which is a bit distracting.)
