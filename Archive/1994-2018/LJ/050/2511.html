    Administering Usenet
    News Servers claims to cover INN,
    DNEWS and PGP software and the planning, building and managing of
    Internet
    and Intranet news services, and it does.

Unfortunately, this isn't it. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Administering Usenet News
Servers</em></span> has a definite lack of a clear focus. If the
authors had a more tightly targeted audience, I believe this could
have been an excellent book. Instead, it is self-defeating by
trying to be all things to all news administrators.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2054580.0x214cb30"></a>What Does It Include?</h2></div></div><p>Let's have a look at what it does cover.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Administering Usenet News Servers</em></span> claims to
cover INN, DNEWS and PGP software and the planning, building and
managing of Internet and Intranet news services, and it
does.</p><p>The book discusses INN and DNEWS and covers installing and
configuring both these NNTP news servers. The differences between
the two are discussed, including why you might choose one over the
other. Included are good appendices with DNEWS and INN
configuration details. All you need to get an INN news server up
and running under Solaris is included on the CD, as well as tools
such as gcc. There is a clear walk-through of an INN install, with
configuration variables that may need to be changed clearly marked.
The installation information includes the PGP/INN configuration
needed for managing newsgroup control messages.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Administering Usenet News Servers</em></span> also
has a reasonable discussion on the need for an &ldquo;Acceptable Use
Policy&rdquo; (AUP) and what such a policy should address. It also makes
some good points on the differences between an Intranet AUP and an
ISP (Internet Service Provider) focused AUP.</p><p>There is a section on newsreaders, which mentions the good
net-keeping seal of approval, but unfortunately only summarises the
main points without including a pointer to the full text on the
web.</p><p>There is a section on project planning, but it keeps a
reasonable balance, showing that there should be a plan and
mentions the sorts of things you need to consider, but it stops
short of trying to teach you to be a project manager. The book also
includes good coverage of some of the business issues involved with
rolling out a news service on an Intranet.</p><p>The focus of the book is its weakness. It is very fond of
Solaris as the example operating system to the extent that a
chapter on installing Solaris is included. The binaries on the
CD-ROM are for Solaris, and the book's examples assume a Solaris
file system layout. Not providing Linux and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span>BSD binaries seems an oversight, but even
if the authors wished to stay in the commercial arena, they should
have considered covering more than just Solaris. I am left with the
feeling that the title should have included a &ldquo;For Solaris&rdquo;
tag.</p><p>The book seems to be mainly aimed at the news service being
rolled out in an Intranet situation, but then leaps off into ISP
land. However, it doesn't cover news to the depth needed by an ISP.
This is demonstrated by the total dismissal without any discussion
of both Cnews and UUCP. Even if the authors wished to recommend
NNTP as the preferred news transport, both Cnews and UUCP are still
widely used and any self-respecting news administrator needs to
know at least how to interact with Cnews systems and what effect
UUCP has on things such as news propagation.</p><p>What about the quality? Did I find any major flaws? Well, PGP
is not on the CD-ROM. The book says it is on page 121, while on
page 221 it indicates you have to use FTP to get it. I also
couldn't find DNEWS on the CD-ROM. The cover says that all you need
to set up an INN or DNEWS service is on the CD-ROM, while the text
of the book indicates you have to download a trial version of
DNEWS. Furthermore, it misses some &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; such as using DNEWS
behind a firewall, where the DNEWS host that collects the news
isn't always the one to which your clients connect. This can cause
problems with the news-on-demand style of fetching news by DNEWS.
(News-on-demand is the news delivery mode that DNEWS uses where no
articles in a newsgroup are fetched from the upstream news
providers until one of the local news clients attempts to read that
group.) The CD-ROM also has some incorrect references, e.g., the
book refers to the gcc-2.7.2 directory in its instructions&mdash;the
actual directory provided is gcc-2.7.</p><p>Overall the book is nicely laid out and straightforward to
read. My conclusion is that while it's not as comprehensive as it
claims to be, it is a good overall view of what is required to
create a functional news service. It will enable a UNIX-aware
administrator to set up a vanilla NNTP service fairly painlessly. I
think it would have worked better aimed squarely at the Intranet
market, including binaries for AIX, Solaris and SunOS.</p></div></div>
