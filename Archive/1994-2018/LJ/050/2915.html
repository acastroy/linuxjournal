file uploads for some months to allow students to upload
assignments to my site for marking. Since they already have
accounts, I use their UNIX password to check who they are.</p><p>File upload is part of HTML 3.2 and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be available from every browser.
However, the standard says this is a slightly obscure part and may
not always be supported. Internet Explorer 3 is one browser that
does not support it, for example. Instead of a file selection box,
the user sees a text entry area, and only the file name is
uploaded, not the contents of the file. You need to guard against
such browsers both at the HTML end (&ldquo;You should see a file
selection box here&rdquo;) and by checking the output at the server
end.</p><p>&mdash;Jan Newmarchjan@ise.canberra.edu.au</p><p>Hmm, I have been using attached files for months with a
variety of clients, and no one ever mentioned this. (I thought I
had tried it with Internet Explorer. I know some of my clients use
IE, but I guess they used Netscape or something when they uploaded
files.) Thanks for teaching me something new.</p><p>&mdash;Reuven LernerReuven@netvision.net.il</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200e3a0"></a>S.u.S.E. Review</h2></div></div><p>I regularly buy <i  >LJ</i> here in Switzerland,
and while in the USA recently I took the opportunity of buying
Issue 46 a few days early as one of my particular interests is
database design. While in general I found issue 46 was up to your
usual excellent standards, it was unfortunately spoiled for me by
the following throw-away remark made by Stu Green in his review of
S.u.S.E. V5.0:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There are some minor errors in translation from
the German, including the presence of some characters unique to
that language being left as is, in particular in the names of
individuals. These mistakes are easy to overlook.</p></blockquote></div><p>Perhaps I have been living in Switzerland (a country with
four national languages) too long, and I'm missing some ironic
humour here. The alternative possibility, that Stu actually
believes that people spelling their own names with characters from
their mother tongue constitutes a <span   class="emphasis"><em>mistake</em></span>, is
surely too insular even for Texas!
</p><p>Given the international history of Linux (please note that
most of the characters <span   class="emphasis"><em>unique</em></span> to German also
exist in, for example, Finnish), it's a shame to see this
Anglo-centric view of the world persist.</p><p>Perhaps the only crumb of comfort I can find in this
situation is that software developers here in Europe and in Asia
will continue to be able to market their products to several
hundred million consumers with minimal competition from the
English-speaking community.</p><p>&mdash;Paul Kennedy</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200e7c0"></a>Sybase Database for Linux?</h2></div></div><p>In the February 1998 <i  >LJ</i>'s &ldquo;From the
Editor&rdquo; under Databases, you said, &ldquo;Sybase sells an official
Linux version but refuses to support it.&rdquo; I have spoken with
several Sybase salespeople, and all of them told me that they do
not sell any version of their SQL server for Linux.</p><p>I was wondering where you got this information, or better
yet, who I might talk to in order to purchase a copy.</p><p>&mdash;James Pricejprice@dwwc.com</p><p>A system administrator, who was researching databases in
order to buy one, made this statement to linux-list on-line. Since
he was someone I know to be trustworthy, I believed it without
checking. [Always a big mistake.] I have since learned that Sybase
did have a client side freely available for a while, but work was
stopped and the server side was not done. It is now being worked on
once more. Our publisher Phil Hughes has been talking to the
programmer doing the port. Sorry for the
misinformation&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200ea28"></a>Removing Files and Security</h2></div></div><p>I'm writing in reference to the &ldquo;Best of Tech Support&rdquo; item
entitled &ldquo;How Do I Remove This File?&rdquo; (March 1998).</p><p>The information given in response to the question is
absolutely correct. However, beyond the basic information about how
to delete such files, a warning should be added: discovery of such
files is a bright red flag that your system may have been
compromised by hackers.</p><p>Hackers will very often use file names and directories with
such names as &ldquo;. &rdquo;, &ldquo;.. &rdquo; and &ldquo;...&rdquo;. These names are easy to
ignore in a directory listing and are commonly overlooked by novice
(and even experienced) users. Also, hackers will use directory
names of legitimate applications, such as &ldquo;.elm&rdquo;, &ldquo;.data&rdquo; and
&ldquo;.tin&rdquo;, because these directories don't show up in a normal
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> listing and because they appear
normal. Naturally, there are many variations on this basic theme,
but if you spot such directories in unexpected places (or even in
legitimate user directories), further investigation is definitely
warranted.</p><p>Another warning flag is the presence of IRC files. The IRC is
a seething hotbed of hacker activity these days, because it's so
easy to become anonymous and because of the total lack of security
controls inherent in the entire IRC system. So called &ldquo;warez&rdquo;
channels provide an easy and totally anonymous way for hackers to
exchange pirated software and hacking tools. If you start seeing
&ldquo;eggbot&rdquo; files on your system, it's possible at least one of your
user IDs is being misused. It's been my experience that many of
these people want only to quietly misuse a stolen account for
purposes of running their IRC bots, but some of them have attempted
some really nasty attacks. In general, it's wise to cast a
suspicious eye on any sort of unexpected IRC activity on your
system.</p><p>Finally, another trick currently in use by hackers is to use
<span   class="bold"><b>lynx</b></span> to download hacking tools. By
storing their files on a web host and then using lynx to retrieve
them, they can bypass the logging that often occurs with an FTP
server and may be able to blend in more easily as a legitimate
user.</p><p>&mdash;Dave Lutzdlutz@smith.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200ed98"></a>Thanks for GPIB Article</h2></div></div><p>First I want to express my appreciation for the article
&ldquo;GPIB: Cool, It Works with Linux!&rdquo; by Timotej Ecimovic, March
1998. I have worked with HPIB and GPIB, and I appreciated his
treatment of that standard and Linux. I felt a special appreciation
for what I perceived as his &ldquo;spirit of Linux&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit of
GNU&rdquo;. He appeared to me to express profound respect for the
efforts of others. He also impressed me with his technical honesty
in that he did not attempt to portray Linux as the perfect solution
for all situations.</p><p>Now a minor critical remarks&mdash;I believe that the &ldquo;About the
cover:&rdquo; is in error in that the screen displayed on the cover is a
snapshot of FVWM95, not FVWM (or FVWM2).</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is one of the few
magazines I not only <span   class="emphasis"><em>hold onto</em></span>, but actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> go back to past issues for reference. Keep
up the excellent work&mdash;even your advertisements are of superior
quality. <i  >Linux Journal</i> is a &ldquo;strange beast&rdquo;
for me as I almost never read advertising in a publication, yet I
find myself reading just about all of the ads in
<i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Leachbleach@BellSouth.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200f160"></a>KDE Comment</h2></div></div><p>First of all, I would like to thank you guys for providing
such an excellent publication. In regards to your March 1998 issue,
I was surprised to see there was no article on KDE. I've used
virtually all of the window managers that are available on the
Internet and believe that KDE is the future of window managers.
Why? KDE provides the ease of use of those
other operating systems while at the same time
utilizing the power of Linux/UNIX. Anyone who uses X should give
KDE a try. Find it at http://www.kde.org/.</p><p>&mdash;Jeffrey Lojylo@ucdavis.edu</p><p>We did get a KDE article for March, but it was one
of the last to arrive and the issue was already full. We will
publish it in the near future. In the May issue of <i  >LJ</i>
there will be a short <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> column
reviewing KDE and GNOME. Miguel de Icaza is writing an article
about GNOME for us&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200f3c8"></a>Red Hat 5.0</h2></div></div><p>I can't believe just how bad Red Hat 5.0 truly is. I've used
Linux since about kernel 0.99 and have used Red Hat since version
4.0 and never have I come across such a terrible release. The bug
list is incredible (check the errata page on their web site), and
worse still, there aren't fixes for all of them yet. Rather than
just post the patches, Red Hat seem intent on forcing RPMs down
your throat by making users download multi-megabyte files rather
than small patches that users could apply to the source code on the
second CD and build themselves.</p><p>Well, Red Hat, this is a very Microsoft-like effort from you.
Your own standards (RPM, AnotherLevel&mdash;heavily bugged) forced upon
users, and an operating system that will be a commercial success
but a technical failure. On a final note, why won't you answer my
e-mail for technical support when I'm a registered user who
purchased the package?</p><p>&mdash;Simon Mauricemaurices@mpx.com.au</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200f580"></a>Setting Up E-mail</h2></div></div><p>My hat is off to Jonathan Walther for an extremely useful
article on Linux home e-mail. I had wondered for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>years</em></span> how this was done. In the past I would
start a PPP connection to my ISP, then use
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> to log in to the ISP in
order to use their Pine to read the mail. Printing an e-mail
involved exporting to a file on the ISP's server, dropping the
TELNET connection, using <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> to
transfer the file to my machine and, finally, printing the
file.</p><p>But no more&mdash;thanks to Jon for turning on the lights. The
whole process took less than an hour and went exactly as outlined
in the article. Everything came up the first time I tried it; no
problems with anything. And this e-mail is coming to SSC from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> Pine on <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> machine in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> house!</p><p>&mdash;Bill Cunninghambwc@coastalnet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200f948"></a>Linux in Colleges</h2></div></div><p>I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed March's article
&ldquo;Linux Means Business: Colleges Using Linux&rdquo; by Don Kuenz. I'd
like to see this view of colleges using Linux become a regular
column&mdash;one for businesses and one for education and research. I
know a lot of people would be interested in this type of article.
For example, our school is very big on Linux. Our system is the COE
Mosaic Linux Tile program which uses Linux machines connected to
our existing AFS system. More information can be found at
http://linux.uncc.edu/.</p><p>I consider this to be pretty impressive and something that
other schools may like to see and try. At the same time I think we
could learn a lot about other schools' implementation of Linux in
the curriculum and for work purposes. We are very active with Linux
at our school. Our newsgroup uncc.Linux is one of the most popular
at the University, and we have a Linux users group that includes
our trusty penguin mascot at each meeting. I enjoyed the article
and hope to see more like it in the future.</p><p>&mdash;Brandon Perkinsbdperkin@uncc.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f16580.0x200fb00"></a>Issue #44, Worth Its Weight in Gold</h2></div></div><p>For nearly a month I agonized and procrastinated over my need
to develop a web site consisting of hundreds of pages that were
similar and related. Creating a few pages is easy and fun, but
anything more becomes tedious and boring. When I turned to the
article &ldquo;Industrializing Web Page Construction&rdquo; in the December
1997 issue (#44), I learned that tools have already been developed
to solve such problems. I installed the software and created 60+
pages in hours. Thank you <i  >LJ</i> and Pieter
Hintjens.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Parryrparry@qualcomm.com</p></div></div>
