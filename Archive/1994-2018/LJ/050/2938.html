    Linus Torvalds tells the Silicon Valley users group about his
    current
    work on the Linux kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe69580.0xf613a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>When we gave the job of arranging
speakers to Sam Ockman, we never doubted his ability to bring in
terrific speakers. His first speaker, for our January meeting, was
his personal hero, H. Peter Anvin. For February, we had two
speakers: Eric Raymond of &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&rdquo; fame,
and Bruce Perens of Debian. Therefore, the question became &ldquo;How do
you top these Linux luminaries?&rdquo; Sam's answer was our March
speaker, Linus Torvalds.
</p><p>Until December, the Silicon Valley Linux Users Group (of
which I am the Vice President) met in the back dining room of the
local Carl's Jr. (local burger chain). Carl's could hold around
40-50 people tightly. We had been talking about moving the meeting
from this spot for some time, and some of our members who worked at
Cisco pleaded to get a room for us for the meeting in February. As
expected, this meeting was standing room only, and we knew that
with Linus coming we needed a much larger space. Again, Cisco (with
Ben Woodard pushing it through) came through for us with a room
spacious enough for 350 people in their Gateway Conference
center.</p><p><a href="2938f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p><a href="2938f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a></p><p>About half an hour before the meeting began, the chairs were
full and people began to sit on the floor, against the walls and
all around the room. Approximately 500 people had come to hear
Linus speak. We were lucky&mdash;the air conditioning was in good shape,
and the fire marshal didn't show up.</p><p>The meeting began and after the user-group formalities were
complete, Linus was presented with the VA Research Excellence in
Open Source Software Award, co-sponsored by Red Hat and O'Reilly.
The prize was a loaded dual Pentium 333 from VA Research. In fact,
Linus made out very well, receiving not only the computer just
mentioned, but also a PalmPilot professional from Klaus Schulz of
3Com and a six-pack of real beer from local legend Rick Moen. It
should be noted that Linus didn't know about any of these awards
before coming to the meeting.</p><p><a href="2938f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p>Accompanied by thunderous applause, Linus stood before the
podium and expressed his shock at the number of people who had
shown up to hear him speak. He had been under the impression that
it would be a small, intimate meeting like the first one he
attended last year at the burger joint.</p><p>He began his speech by telling the group what he wouldn't be
talking about. He said he wouldn't be talking about user issues or
MIS issues&mdash;all he would talk about was what he was doing with the
kernel.</p><p><a href="2938f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4</a></p><p>The hour-long speech (not counting the Q&amp;A afterward) was
a technical discussion of how he is improving SMP (symmetric
multi-processing) support in the kernel. He talked about the
challenges of moving from a single kernel resource lock for all
CPUs as in the 2.0.x kernels to individual resource locks for the
new kernels. He discussed the ways these changes affect things
internally for the kernel, and how it affects the handling of
shared memory, interrupts and I/O. Linus also spent some time
talking about how the file system is being changed internally for
better performance. The speech will be available on-line by the
time this article goes to print (see Resources); I'd recommend that
you download it and listen to the whole thing.</p><p><a href="2938f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 5</a></p><p>In addition to videotaping the speech and taking still
photos, the meeting in its entirety was broadcast over the MBone
(Internet protocol multicast backbone). After Linus had finished
speaking, the door prizes were given out, and everyone left the
meeting happier and smarter than they were the day before. Special
thanks are due to Linus Torvalds for speaking and to everyone else
involved in making this meeting a success.</p><p><a href="2938s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
