    Here's a way to get control of your mail with secure, high
    performance and freely available software called qmail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c8450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The program
<span   class="bold"><b>qmail</b></span> is a secure and reliable
replacement for <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>; it was
written by Dan Bernstein at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
I was attracted to it for several reasons, the most important being
that it runs under Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>qmail</b></span> is substantially more
secure than sendmail. The system is partitioned into several
modules, minimizing the amount of code which runs as root. The
/var/spool/mail directory is gone; incoming mail for a user is
stored in the user's home directory, eliminating a nagging security
hole. qmail gives you control over which mail you accept. You can
selectively allow other hosts to use your system as a relay,
blocking out all others.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>qmail</b></span> supports mailing lists
with automated subscriptions, and these lists can be configured and
maintained entirely by the user. No intervention is required on the
part of the system administrator to create a new list.</p><p>qmail's performance is stellar. Dan Bernstein cites Red Hat
Software as an example. Red Hat was running sendmail 8.7 on a 48MB
Pentium and found their daily load of 70,000 messages was beginning
to overwhelm the system. They switched to qmail on a 16MB 486/66,
and their mail hub is now running fine, even on the less powerful
hardware.</p><p>The reason I began looking into qmail as an alternative to
sendmail is the fact that qmail supported e-mail for virtual
domains correctly long before sendmail did. Those of you running
several virtual domains on a single Linux host can rejoice. With
qmail, the e-mail names you select for your virtual domains come
from per-virtual-domain name spaces, rather than a single host-wide
name space. This means you can have e-mail names like
webmaster@domain1.com and webmaster@domain2.com
simultaneously.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c8818"></a>Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>The only problem we have had with qmail is the fact that its
outgoing queue uses inode numbers in its database; this means the
queue cannot be backed up on one machine and restored to another.
When we have a disk failure, we must recreate an empty qmail queue
directory rather than restoring from backup.</p><p>The fact that qmail is not sendmail implies some
complications when installing add-on e-mail packages like
majordomo. In general there are patched versions of these packages
available for qmail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c8978"></a>qmail Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The qmail sources are available at
ftp://koobera.math.uic.edu/www/qmail.html and a lot of useful
information is available at http://www.qmail.org/. Compilation and
installation of qmail is straightforward. Those who balked at the
sendmail.cf file will be pleasantly surprised at qmail's
configuration. Everything is human readable and easy to understand.
Some claim that sendmail.cf is human readable, but I would argue
that point.</p><p>Once you have qmail configured and operational, you can start
adding virtual domains. The rest of this article deals with virtual
domains under qmail. All file and path names assume the default
qmail installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c8ad8"></a>Supporting E-mail for a New Virtual
Domain</h2></div></div><p>Set up the new virtual domain normally. Many of you will have
already done this to support the virtual domain with other services
like Apache <span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>. Make sure there
is an MX record in DNS to point mail for the virtual domain to the
host running qmail.</p><p>Create a master user ID and home directory for the new
domain. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>master user</em></span> is just a user who
will control all mail for your virtual domain. I generally create a
user ID for each virtual domain which the administrators of that
domain can use to upload the content for their web site. qmail can
use the same user ID.</p><p>Add a line to /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains for the new
domain, directing mail for that domain to the user created above.
If the domain is abc.com and the user is abc, an appropriate line
would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
abc.com:abc
</pre><p>Add abc.com to /var/qmail/rcpthosts to tell qmail you're
willing to accept mail addressed to abc.com. Ensure abc.com does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> appear in /var/qmail/control/locals/.
</p><p>Once mail is directed to a user, it is controlled through a
series of .qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> files in that user's home
directory. Create the file ~abc/.qmail-default, to indicate user
abc is willing to accept all mail directed to the abc.com
domain.</p><p>Restart qmail and e-mail for all users at abc.com, i.e.,
john.smith@abc.com, webmaster@abc.com, etc. will now be received by
the local user abc. I suspect this is not precisely what you had in
mind, so read on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c8f50"></a>Forwarding a Virtual Domain User's Mail</h2></div></div><p>If mail for a new user in a virtual domain is to be forwarded
to an existing on-site user or to an off-site user, you don't need
to create an account for the new user. You can create a
.qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> file in the virtual domain master
user's home directory to forward the mail. The master user is the
user we created above, who is currently receiving all mail for the
virtual domain. For the address john.smith@abc.com, you create a
file ~abc/.qmail-john:smith, containing the address to which John's
mail is to be forwarded in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;smith.john@home.boston.ma.us
</pre><p>Note that any periods in the user's Internet name are
replaced with colons in the .qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> file
name. The forwarding address which is stored within the
.qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> file does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
have periods replaced with colons.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c9268"></a>POP3 Mail for a Virtual Domain User</h2></div></div><p>If a user of a virtual domain will be picking up his mail
using POP3, you must create an account and an incoming mail
directory for him. The POP3 daemon, which comes with qmail, cannot
pick up mail from an ordinary mbox formatted file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# adduser jsmith
# chmod g-w ~jsmith
# chmod o-w ~jsmith
# cd ~jsmith
# maildirmake Maildir
# chown -R jsmith.users Maildir
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> commands in the
above script ensure that no one can write to jsmith's home
directory except jsmith himself. qmail enforces this requirement as
a security measure, but it can be relaxed with a compile-time
option&mdash;see <b  >ALIAS_PATERNALISM</b> in the
conf-unusual.h file.
</p><p>Note that under Linux distributions which include the adduser
command, like Slackware, you can do a
<span   class="bold"><b>maildirmake</b></span> in /etc/skel, so new
users will automatically get a Maildir.</p><p>As in the previous section, you need to create a
.qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> file in the home directory of the
virtual domain's master user to forward mail to each individual
user. To forward mail for john.smith@abc.com to the local user
jsmith we would create a file, ~abc/.qmail-john:smith, containing
the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;jsmith
</pre><p>To indicate where his incoming mail should be stored, we
would create a .qmail file in the home directory for jsmith,
containing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/jsmith/Maildir/
</pre>


This step is required because the qmail POP server expects to find
a user's mail in a specially constructed directory (the default
name of which is Maildir), and we have to tell qmail to put it
there.
</p><p>Once you start storing incoming mail in a nonstandard place,
you have to tell the local mail programs where to find it. The
standard Linux mail programs cannot read mail from the Maildir
format, so qmail includes several wrapper programs to move any
incoming mail into mbox format (qail, qine, qlm, for mail, pine and
elm respectively). You can rename the real mail user agents and
link these wrappers to the usual names, so your users won't even
see a difference. These wrappers need a bit of information to
operate correctly. To take care of this, add this type of lines to
the /etc/profile file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir
export MAIL=$HOME/Mailbox
export MAILTMP=$HOME/Mailbox.tmp
</pre><p>The final thing you have to do is install qmail's POP3
daemon. It is split into three programs, one of which deals with
user names and passwords. Those of you with shadow passwords
installed will appreciate this modularity. A password checking
program, <span   class="bold"><b>checkpassword</b></span>, which
works with ordinary Linux /etc/passwd files, is available at the
same URL as the qmail distribution. The POP3 line in your
/etc/inetd.conf will have to be modified. How to do this is
described in detail in the FAQ that comes with qmail.
</p><p>If you feel the above changes are too disruptive, an
alternative is to patch your existing POP3 daemon to look for a
user's incoming mail in an mbox-formatted file in the user's home
directory, rather than a similar file in /var/spool/mail. One such
package is available at ftp://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/qmail/. The
only thing you lose by using a patched POP server rather than the
POP server distributed with qmail is the much more reliable Maildir
mail storage format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x11c98f0"></a>Forwarding Virtual Domain User Mail Without a
Master User</h2></div></div><p>If you want to forward all mail for a new virtual domain, but
you have no reason to create a master user ID for that domain
(e.g., you're not providing web services), you can do this using
the special <span   class="emphasis"><em>alias user</em></span> ID. Instead of adding
the line <b  >abc.com:abc</b> to
/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains, add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
abc.com:alias-abc
</pre><p>This designates the alias user as the responsible party for
all mail to the abc.com domain. qmail's default installation sets
the alias user's home directory to /var/qmail/alias, so control of
all e-mail for abc.com is done in this directory.
</p><p>You can create a file ~alias/.qmail-abc-default to forward
all mail for abc.com to a specific user. You can also create a
series of files, like ~alias/.qmail-abc-webmaster and
~alias/.qmail-abc-john:smith, to forward mail for specific people
at abc.com.</p><p>Note that the alias user (or any other user) can control mail
for multiple virtual domains. To control abc.com and
anotherdomain.org, put the following lines in the
/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
abc.com:alias-abc
anotherdomain.org:alias-anotherdomain
</pre><p>You'll need these files in the ~alias directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
~alias/.qmail-abc-john:smith
~alias/.qmail-abc-nancy:jones
~alias/.qmail-abc-webmaster
~alias/.qmail-anotherdomain-sam:adams
~alias/.qmail-anotherdomain-webmaster
</pre>


Note that unlike sendmail, you can have two users with the same
Internet user name, as long as they're in different virtual
domains. In the above example, there's a webmaster@abc.com and a
webmaster@anotherdomain.org.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x15c1f60"></a>To Handle a Virtual Domain With an
/etc/aliases-like File</h2></div></div><p>If you have hundreds of users for a virtual domain, you can
avoid the hundreds of .qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> files with a
small script that calls qmail's forward command.</p><p>Instead of creating individual
.qmail-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> files in the virtual domain master
user's home directory, create a single .qmail-default file
containing the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
|/usr/local/bin/qmail_db_lookup /home/master/qmail_db
</pre><p>with /home/master/qmail_db modified to reflect the home
directory of your virtual domain. You can then create (or adapt
from your existing /etc/aliases) the file /home/master/qmail_db,
consisting of lines with the virtual domain user, a colon and the
forwarding address(es). The special user name &ldquo;-&rdquo; indicates where
mail should be forwarded for any users not explicitly listed. If
the &ldquo;-&rdquo; user name is not provided, mail for nonexistent users
will be bounced. A sample qmail_db file might look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-:  postmaster@somewhere.com
john.smith:   john.smith@alo.com
carl.jones:   cjones@test.net
karen.quincy: kquincy
all:  john.smith@alo.com cjones@test.net kquincy
</pre>


Note the forwarding addresses for the &ldquo;-&rdquo; user must be an actual
address; otherwise, mail to nonexistent addresses in the virtual
domain will be accepted, but not delivered to anyone.
</p><p><a href="2313l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>A more substantial package for supporting /etc/aliases,
<span   class="bold"><b>qmsmac</b></span>, is available with qmail.
<span   class="bold"><b>qmsmac</b></span> supports arbitrarily
deep-nested aliases and long aliases but, like sendmail, requires
you to rebuild a database of aliases every time your /etc/aliases
file is changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10d0580.0x15c2430"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>qmail appears to be a speedy and robust replacement for
sendmail. We've had qmail running on our Linux Internet server for
many months now without a single glitch. The additional features
provided by qmail could be useful to those of you hosting several
virtual domains from a single Linux box, and the simpler
configuration is an added bonus.</p></div></div>
