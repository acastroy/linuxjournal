upgrades&mdash;has been my standard operating system for all my clients
since its release. Its ease of use, reliability, simplified
install, corporate support and TheNextLevel X Window System
interface have made it my preferred Linux. However, I was beginning
to feel that 4.2 was getting exceptionally long in the tooth, over
6 months old&mdash;two Internet <span   class="emphasis"><em>years</em></span>. Therefore, I
was overjoyed when 5.0 was released on December 1, 1997 and
delighted when Red Hat started to ship Netscape 4.04 as standard in
late January.</p><p>This review details my experiences with 5.0 in the two months
since its release. I maintain 17 Linux machines, 5 of which are now
running 5.0.</p><p>Red Hat 5.0 can be installed via CD-ROM, hard disk, NFS or
FTP. Red Hat 4.2's SMB install option has been dropped. It's a
simple matter to drop an FTP server onto a Windows 95 or NT box, so
I can live without SMB support for installation.</p><p>I installed the commercial release of the Intel version from
CD, and Retro installed the freeware release of the DEC Alpha
version via FTP. Most of my computers support booting from CD-ROM,
but the CD-ROM only booted on two of my most recently built
machines.</p><p>The NFS and FTP installation options are best used on a file
server on your internal network. Installing via FTP over a T1 line
or less is painfully slow, so you are better off pulling down a
mirror of the release overnight and installing from a local
machine. If you have multiple machines to install or upgrade, NFS
and FTP are convenient, allowing you to update or install new
versions of Red Hat on several machines at the same time. (You
should copy the distribution to the hard disk, as CD-ROMs don't
handle concurrent access very well.)</p><p>Performing the base upgrade is simple, but getting everything
working again is not so easy. The CD-ROM release with prebuilt
installation floppies arrived in my mailbox. I inserted disk one
into my first computer, but it wasn't needed&mdash;Red Hat booted from
the CD-ROM. I selected automatic install, then upgrade. Red Hat
then prompted me to override or add additional packages. Because I
was unfamiliar with the packages already installed in this machine
I decided to just take the defaults and go with the flow. I
regretted this later. The remainder of the automated upgrade
procedure took about 15 minutes on a 24x CD-ROM, then prompted me
for X Window System and network information.</p><p>Rebooting was slow and fraught with errors. When the machine
finally came up, it turned out the network interface was
incorrectly recognized. No problem, I said, I'll just recompile the
kernel with the correct options.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make xconfig; make clean; make dep; make zlilo
make modules; make modules_install
shutdown -r now
</pre><p>Here's where I have a beef with Red Hat&mdash;their penchant for
&ldquo;pristine sources&rdquo; means that by default both /etc/lilo.conf and
the /usr/src/linux/Makefile need to be modified for a new kernel to
boot correctly&mdash;a very confusing thing for first timers. I
recompiled and rebooted again:
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> hung, AMD broke,
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> broke, Samba hung, Povray
broke. The list of broken programs was quite long, and although
fixing each problem took only a few minutes, it was days before I
had a completely functioning system again. Now that the
installation process is over, the boxes I have are very usable and
stable, but I really don't want to have to go through that again
for all my production machines.
</p><p>Red Hat 5.0 features an automated scripting utility that
allows you to upgrade or install on a number of machines. Unless I
had a large number of very similar machines (like the rendering
farm of Alphas used for the Titanic movie), I'd be leery of using
an entirely automated installation script. I'd rather have problems
upgrading a few machines at a time than have every one of my
computers in an undefined state and the phone ringing off the
hook.</p><p><a href="2671s1.html" target="_self">Red Hat 5.0 Tweaks and
Tips</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d7370"></a>New Features</h2></div></div><p>With &ldquo;New VERSION 5.0&rdquo; written in friendly large blue
letters on the cover and a rewritten installation section, the
manual has grown significantly since the 4.2 release. Release notes
and upgrades are available on the Red Hat web site, as well as on
the CD-ROM. Just as I wouldn't recommend seriously using NT or
Windows 95 without the associated resource kit, I recommend a
companion book like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> or the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</em></span> from
O'Reilly and Associates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d7528"></a>Glibc and Linux 2.0.31&mdash;A Line Drawn in the
Sand</h2></div></div><p>The biggest change in 5.0 is the switch to a different C
library, Glibc. Linux 2.1.x kernel development is hopefully nearing
the end of a long and exceptionally chaotic development cycle&mdash;the
new dcache, finer grained SMP and a raft of new features and
performance enhancements are causing trouble. This is nothing new
for Linux, but it's been a long time since the last &ldquo;stable&rdquo;
release of 2.1. On top of all the ongoing kernel changes is a new
standard GNU C library, Glibc. Glibc has a clean threads
implementation, transparent support for IPv4 and IPv6, improved
linking and other incremental improvements that ultimately turn it
into a whole new animal. The combination of new library plus new
kernel code makes it harder to isolate bugs.</p><p>By biting the bullet now, choosing to bundle the new C
library and stick with a proven release of the kernel, Red Hat is
doing the world's Linux developers and ultimately its users a
service. Threading is a standard feature of competing operating
systems, such as NT and Solaris, and very important to Linux's new
bleeding edge GUIs: KDE and Enlightenment. In the short term there
will be a flurry of Red Hat 5.0 incompatible software which should
be cleaned up by the time you read this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d7688"></a>The Not So Graphical Desktop</h2></div></div><p>The graphical on-line help system is still hopelessly crude.
The tools (notably <span   class="bold"><b>htdig</b></span>) exist to
make an excellent searchable archive of all the included html/text
documentation, and it's too bad that the default help system is so
slow and clunky. The Red Hat 5.0 network configurator now has
support for configuring a PAP (password authentication protocol)
PPP session, which saves some troublesome scripting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d77e8"></a>Security, Patches and Upgrades</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat 5.0 includes many security enhancements. Because of
the change to Glibc, all of the applications had to be recompiled
and relinked. As a result, it is hard to tell which programs have
been upgraded or changed.</p><p>Yet, there are (as of this writing) 54 additional patches in
http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/rh50-errata-general.html and
8 in Intel, including a critical kernel upgrade that blocks the
Teardrop attack. The Teardrop Denial of Service attack immediately
made the kernel (2.0.30) shipped with this release obsolete.
Someone decided to hit me with Teardrop, crashing my servers every
night for two weeks. The newest kernel (2.0.32) successfully
detects, logs and blocks this attack.</p><p>You should <span   class="emphasis"><em>immediately</em></span> install a new
kernel and many of the RPMs if you intend to use your 5.0 system on
the Internet. On installing a new release, the first commands I run
are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /usr/local/rpms
cd /usr/local/rpms
ncftp -R -d 5 \
        ftp.redhat.com:/pub/linux/redhat-5.0/
rpm -i -upgrade *
</pre><p>Substitute your favorite mirror for the FTP address. The
<span   class="bold"><b>wget</b></span> utility (available from the
GNU archives) is slightly better for mirroring sites in this
fashion, as it supports both FTP and HTTP, partial file/directory
transfers, time-stamped updates and automatically uses PASV mode
(necessary for FTP to work through a firewall).
</p><p>The fact that patches for these problems are so readily
available is a tribute to the flexibility of RPM and the hard
working bunch of Linux folk who are countering the persistent
cracking community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17d7b58"></a>Maximum RPMs</h2></div></div><p>RPM's FTP and FTP proxy support are now documented on the man
page, but to use RPM effectively to distribute your own software
requires the book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maximum RPMs</em></span>, available
from Red Hat.</p><p>The UNIX world needs a software installer of the caliber of
the Windows 95/NT Installshield. RPM is a good, even great start,
but Debian Linux's installer beats the RPM/GLINT combination for
both interactivity and ease of use. An RPM/GLINT release combining
the best features of RPM and Debian would be a <span   class="emphasis"><em>good
thing</em></span>.</p><p><a href="2671t1.html" target="_self">Linux Versus Microsoft
NT</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17ce6a8"></a>Commercial Features</h2></div></div><p>The RedBaron web browser has been dropped&mdash;Netscape 4.04 is
freely available and is a vastly superior product. You will have to
download it from the Net, however, as it's not bundled on the
CD&mdash;yet.</p><p>Metro-X boasts of a nice configuration screen, added card
support and improved color depth, resolution and performance over
the XFree86 release of the X server. In my case, Metro-X is of
marginal utility&mdash;the XFree and S.u.S.E. drivers for my ET6000 and
Mystique cards are as fast or faster and more reliable. You have to
configure XFree in order to even try to configure Metro Link in
many cases.</p><p>Metro Link has some excellent add-on libraries, notably
OpenGL, which is experiencing enormous interest in light of the PC
gaming phenomenon. If you intend to use OpenGL, the bundled Metro-X
server saves you money against the purchase of the extra OpenGL
libraries. Your other choice is the freely available OpenGL clone,
MESA, which converts OpenGL calls into X code&mdash;which is, in theory,
much slower.</p><p>The new backup program with the unwieldy name of BRU 2000-PE
is straightforward enough for a single-user environment. In my
environment, where I have to back up multiple machines to a single
tape drive, through a firewall, the combination of
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>dump</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> works exceptionally
well.</p><p>The newly bundled RealAudio 5.0 server and client are very
sexy products. I've now hooked up my studio to my main Linux box so
that I can broadcast live sessions to the Internet. The server
operated flawlessly. The live encoder worked great once I had a
working sound card and worked out the correct encoding rate. The
95/NT versions of the software have nicer interfaces, but I've
already had months and months of uptime on my primary RealAudio
server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17cea18"></a>Favorite Features</h2></div></div><p>The sendmail featured in this release has improved anti-spam
protection. No longer is it possible for a random spammer to use
your host as an unwitting e-mail relay.</p><p>TheNextLevel is an excellent front end to X, offering much
the same look and feel as Windows 95 and NT 4.0. The Red Hat 5.0
release of TheNextLevel is much closer to the look and feel of
Windows 95; in particular, the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of having to click to
gain keyboard focus is enabled by default now, so first-time Linux
users feel more at home.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17ceb78"></a>Corporate Support</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat has announced a set of support plans and partnerships
that should make Linux more acceptable in the corporate world.
Also, Linux's distributed support model has recently won awards
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Infoworld</em></span> and other magazines for &ldquo;Best
Technical Support&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16de580.0x17cecd8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Over the course of these upgrades I did a number of things
that are difficult, expensive or impossible to do with NT or
Windows 95. Immediately after the base install was complete, I was
able to exit the computer room. From the comfort of my own office,
I completed the upgrades, added additional software, etc. From the
comfort of my home, through <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> firewalls, I
initiated a remote backup, did an A/B comparison of the new
features of Red Hat via X in an ssh tunnel, wrote this review and
installed, configured or updated even more of the Linux software.
UNIX's enormous advantage in the remote administration area will
probably continue into the age of high speed Internet access in the
home.</p><p>Red Hat 5.0 is a solid core Linux distribution with a sharp
eye out for the future. The new Glibc library implies a little risk
and breaks some backward compatibility&mdash;expect to update this
library a lot over the coming months as new bugs are found and
fixed&mdash;however, the additional features are worth it. The future
for both Red Hat and Linux looks very exciting&mdash;with the rapidly
advancing KDE and GNOME/Enlightenment desktops and the release of
Netscape source code.</p><p>But it's not all clover. During the installation,
configuration and upgrade process there remain many problems which
stopped two otherwise enthusiastic first time users and had me
stumped more than once.</p><p>Due to the large number of patches and upgrades already
required, I'm going to wait for 5.1 to put this release onto the
rest of my production machines. I'm very concerned about potential
security holes in Glibc. Red Hat 5.0 is an evolutionary release.
Sometimes you have to take a step backward to take two steps
forward. Red Hat 4.2 is a more mature, easier to use distribution
than Red Hat 5.0. At this point I'd recommend 5.0 only to
developers.</p><p>Red Hat is freely available from the Internet and in a
commercial release that costs $49.95 US. It is also available
bundled with books, manuals and/or applications.</p><p><a href="2671s2.html" target="_self">Red Hat Alpha</a></p></div></div>
