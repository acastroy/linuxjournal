    Mr. Whitehouse gives us an introduction to a free software
    package for manipulating images&mdash;ImageMagick.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c42580.0x1d3a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ever since the first computers with
graphical displays, computer editing and transformation of images
has been one of the most popular application areas. There should be
little surprise that there is a multiplicity of free graphic
software available under Linux.
</p><p>Many of the available packages are targeted towards specific
applications: there are many graphics libraries available for
programmers which address reading and writing specific file
formats. There are also image viewers available which allow
interactive editing as well. ImageMagick is different in that it
provides a comprehensive set of tools which can be used
interactively in the X Window System or command-line driven. These
tools are based around a common library, written in C.</p><p>For those who want to go beyond the capabilities of the
precompiled programs (see the sidebar &ldquo;Getting ImageMagick&rdquo;), the
library is extensible to allow the addition of different image file
formats. The library can also be used from your own programs
through its well documented API. In addition, both Perl and Python
interfaces are available to allow image manipulation from
scripts.</p><p>If you want to try out some of the features of the
ImageMagick tools, many of them can be used on-line via the Imaging
Machine at http://www.vrl.com/Imaging/.</p><p>It is impossible for an article such as this to cover every
aspect of ImageMagick; therefore, I have written a short
description of each of the major programs. A very good set of
on-line documentation can be found at the ImageMagick web site&mdash;it
covers all aspects of using and programming the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c42580.0x1d3a660"></a>Display</h2></div></div><p><a href="2707f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Display of File Images</b></span></a></p><p>The display program loads images from a file and displays
them on the screen (see Figure 1). It has a large number of
command-line options which make it very flexible. Display is ideal
for running from a script for a presentation or demonstration and
will show video as well as still images. Images can be manipulated
in a variety of ways, either from the command line or
interactively. Figure 2 shows a set of images (the original is in
the top left hand corner) that illustrate some of the effects
available. In each case, the settings used are the default settings
for that effect.</p><p><a href="2707f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Display of Thumbnail Images</b></span></a></p><p>The display program is quite similar to John Bradley's
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> image viewer. To display an
image, you can either select one interactively from the menus (see
Figure 3) or at the prompt type the command:</p><p><a href="2707f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Image
Magick Menu</b></span></a></p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ display image.gif
</pre><p>In my research I work with many images in a raw format called
YUV 4:1:1. This represents an image as a number of bytes. The YUV
representation of an image is a combination of the luminance
information in the image (a black and white version) called the Y
component, and the chrominance information (the extra information
required to make the black and white image into a colour image)
called the U and V components. The Y component is thus made up of
one unsigned byte per pixel in the image. Since the human eye is
less sensitive to colour than luminance, the U and V components,
each consisting of a number of signed bytes, are included at half
the rate of the Y component. This gives a rather primitive form of
lossy image compression compared to the more usual RGB
representation where three unsigned bytes are used for every pixel
in the image. In the examples here I will use a 176 by 144 pixel
image. In order to display such an image, the following command can
be used:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ display -size 176x144\
image.yuv
</pre>


In addition, if your image file has a header which is not among the
supported types and you know that the image is in YUV format (this
also applies to other raw formats), you can display it if you know
the size of the header. For example, the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ display -size 176x144+16 image.yuv
</pre>


displays a raw YUV image, with a 16-byte header.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c42580.0x1d3ac90"></a>Import</h2></div></div><p>Import is an X image-capture program. It captures the
contents of a target window, which may be specified in a variety of
ways and stores it in a file. The captured image can then be viewed
and manipulated with the following tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Animate</b></span>, as its title
suggests, displays an image sequence, which can be an MPEG file or
a multi-image TIFF or MIFF file. The program works out the number
of colours required to display the sequence before starting to play
it so that the same palette can be used throughout to avoid
interactions with colour schemes of the X Window System.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Montage</b></span> combines several
images into a single image. It is useful in preparing figures for
papers and magazine articles, for example. There are options to
annotate each image with text and to specify the background texture
and colour and the border size. Figure 2 was created from the
individual images by use of the montage program. The layout of the
tiles and the labels were specified on the command line, and all
other settings kept their default values.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Convert</b></span> allows command-line
conversion of images to and from many different formats. Its most
common use is to convert to, and from, the ImageMagick MIFF
format.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mogrify</b></span> provides a variety
of different transforms which can be applied to images. A
command-line interface to the transforms is available in the menus
of the display program.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Identify</b></span> prints all sorts of
useful information about images, including a check on the
completeness of the image and whether it is corrupt or not. Here is
some example output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify image.gif
image.gif 106x80+0+0 PseudoClass 256c 13453b GIF 2s
</pre><p>In this case the image is in GIF format image, 106 by 80
pixels in size, has a PseudoClass colour map with 256 colours, is
13453 bytes in size and took 2 seconds to process. The
<b  >-verbose</b> option prints a more comprehensive list
of information including the colour map.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Combine</b></span> allows you to
combine images in all manner of different ways. It can also be used
to create difference images from two input images to see how they
differ. There are a variety of ways in which images can be combined
in addition to these two.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c42580.0x1d3b2c0"></a>Programming with ImageMagick</h2></div></div><p>While there are many packages available with some or all of
the functions listed above, the real strength of ImageMagick lies
in the ability to write programs using its library
functions.</p><p>Included in the distribution is a simple program to
demonstrate how to write your own image manipulation programs. It
loads an image in JPEG format and creates a thumbnail in GIF
format. I have changed the program slightly from its form in the
distribution and presented it below. The thumbnail version will
look something like the original image in Figure 1.</p><p>The C API to the ImageMagick library is documented through a
set of web pages, which are also included in the
distribution.</p><p>To compile the example code in
<a href="2707l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, you will need to give a
command such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o example example.c -lMagick\
        -lX11 -lXext -ltiff -lpng\&lt;\n&gt;
        -I/usr/include/X11/magick -L/usr/X11/lib
</pre><p>The exact number of libraries required and the location of
the libraries and include files will depend on the configuration of
your system. The example given here works on my Red Hat 4.2 system
installed from the RPM ImageMagick distribution.
</p><p>To use the program, create a file called image.jpg and run
the program in the same directory. The result will be a
thumbnail-sized version of the original image called
image.gif.</p><p>Using the included documentation, it is easy to see how this
example can be extended and modified to form the basis of a wide
variety of different functions. The same calls may also be made
from Perl using the PerlMagick interface. Since I am not a Perl
programmer, I have not investigated this interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c42580.0x1d3b688"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>ImageMagick is a complex package to use to its full
potential; it is also very powerful. It offers a wealth of features
in a flexible manner. It is easy to use the basic features without
worrying about the more esoteric options available. I suspect that
many people will use the basic options combined with only one or
two of the more advanced options according to their
application.</p><p>I consider ImageMagick a package well worth investigating for
anyone needing anything from a basic image viewer to a full-fledged
custom image manipulation system.</p><p>Pictures of Alan Cox are courtesy of Justin Mitchell and the
