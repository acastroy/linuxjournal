    NIS is a system for sharing system information between
    machines. Mr. Brown tells us how to set up and use it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x12942f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As networks of computers grow, it is
increasingly important to share common system information between
them to present a unified appearance to the computer user. To share
files, we use NFS or Samba protocols to communicate with a file
server. Mail is often kept in a central location and accessed from
clients with POP3 or IMAP protocols. However, most Linux
distributions aren't ready &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; to share
configuration file information. This doesn't have to be the case.
</p><p>The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system originally
invented by Sun Microsystems for distributing shared configuration
files seamlessly across a network. Files such as /etc/passwrd and
/etc/group become more and more difficult to maintain by hand as
the number of machines grows beyond two or three. For instance, if
user <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> changes his password on one computer
in a work group or cluster, he will probably expect to be able to
sit down at a machine across the room and use his new password to
log in. However, because the password configuration file is not
shared, the reality is that he now has two passwords; the new one
on the machine he just sat at and the old one on all the other
machines. Each time he uses a new computer he will have to change
his password. As the number of machines increases, this becomes
more than merely annoying.</p><p>While schemes other than NIS exist for keeping files
synchronized, they are generally &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; involving
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> and leave much to be desired
in the way of flexibility. Additionally, NIS has become a UNIX
industry standard, supported by many of the commercial UNIX
vendors, including IBM (AIX), Hewlett Packard (HP-UX) and of course
Sun (SunOS/Solaris). As a result, when setting up Linux computers
in a heterogeneous UNIX environment, NIS is often the rule rather
than the exception.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x12945b0"></a>Linux NIS Support</h2></div></div><p>There are two major versions of NIS. The first, called NIS
but historically referred to as Yellow Pages or YP, is
well-supported by Linux. The second, called NIS+, is a new
implementation of NIS which attempts to address security issues in
the original protocol through encryption and other methods. NIS+
support in Linux is of beta quality and is readily available only
in the new <span   class="bold"><b>glibc/libc6</b></span>, which
currently applies to a very small fraction of the installed Linux
base. NIS+ is best suited for very large installations: in most
cases the &ldquo;original&rdquo; NIS is sufficient and reasonably secure when
the proper precautions are taken.</p><p>Linux has included most of the components necessary to
support NIS for a long time, but unfortunately distributions such
as Slackware and Red Hat fail to provide adequate setup information
or a complete set of tools.</p><p>Documentation has also historically been severely lacking;
the NIS-HOWTO was neglected and outdated for a very long time, and
it was only in November of 1997 that it finally received some major
updates from one of the new NIS maintainers. In general, setting up
NIS on Linux has been perceived as one of the hardest
administrative tasks an administrator could undertake. I hope to
change that sentiment with this article.</p><p>NIS support involves several things. To serve configuration
files, one computer acts as an NIS &ldquo;master&rdquo;. It is possible to
have several NIS server machines, but machines in addition to the
master are called &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; and are provided only for fail-safe
redundancy. All of the other computers that receive information
from the server computer(s) are called &ldquo;clients&rdquo;. This article
deals primarily with setting up Linux NIS clients, but describes
the basics of configuring Linux to act as a server as well. A
description of configuring NIS slaves and other advanced features
are beyond the scope of this article. If you need more information
in these areas, I suggest that you obtain the excellent book from
O'Reilly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing NFS and NIS</em></span>, which,
although Sun-oriented, has much information applicable to Linux as
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x1294870"></a>Setting Up an NIS Server</h2></div></div><p>If you do not have an NIS master server on your network, you
will need to set one up. If you do have one, you can skip this
section. The package for setting up NIS servers is logically called
<span   class="bold"><b>ypserv</b></span>, and the latest stable
version at the time of this writing (February) is 1.2.6.
Unfortunately, Red Hat 4.2 ships with an older version that you
probably don't want to use. There is a contributed RPM in the
directory /contrib/hurricane/SRPMS on the Red Hat mirror sites, and
if you get the source RPM, you can rebuild it and use it.
Otherwise, the URL at which the original distribution can be found
is ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/linux/local/yp/.</p><p>After configuring and installing the ypserv package (the
default locations it specifies are fine), make sure that it will be
started at boot time. The RPM will install the appropriate
SYSV-style <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> scripts, but if
you are using another Linux, you will have to add a command to
start /usr/sbin/ypserv in the configuration file from which network
daemons are started, usually /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2.</p><p>The files an NIS server makes available to its clients are
not the actual local configuration files, but &ldquo;compiled&rdquo; versions
of these that are referred to as the NIS &ldquo;maps&rdquo;. The process of
creating NIS maps is done with a Makefile, and so I refer to the
process as akin to compiling. NIS maps are in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gdbm</em></span> UNIX database format for quick random
access. The main directory where this all takes place is
/var/yp.</p><p>You also have to update a few configuration files
specifically for your site. If you don't want all the traditional
files published via NIS to be available to clients, you will have
to edit /var/yp/Makefile and remove the rules for files you wish to
omit. A typical rule might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
networks: networks.byaddr networks.byname
</pre><p>A stock Red Hat 4.2 system doesn't come with the
/etc/networks file; you will get an error when running
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> if the file is not present.
Comment out this line with a &ldquo;#&rdquo; character at the beginning.
Luckily, the Makefile has a great deal of documentation included
with all the different options so making changes to it is a breeze.
</p><p>For security reasons you may also want to edit
/etc/ypserv.conf and change a few defaults. The man page for
ypserv.conf explains each of the options. The most important ones
are <span   class="bold"><b>sunos_kludge</b></span>, which you will
have to set to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if you have old SunOS 4.1.x machines on your
NIS network, and the &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; section that allows you to include
and exclude certain hosts from accessing specific NIS maps on the
server. The <span   class="bold"><b>ypserv</b></span> daemon also
supports the TCP wrappers package, and this gives you another
option for fine-grained access control. This is not an article on
security, though, so if you are installing the server in an
environment where security is of the utmost importance, read the
documentation that comes with the server carefully.</p><p>You're almost done; the last thing you need to do is to
create the initial build of NIS maps from the local configuration
files. To do this, run <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> in
/var/yp. This will create a lot of files that you will never have
to alter, but these are the files that actually get served to the
clients. If you get an error during the make process, chances are
that one of the files make is trying to convert to an NIS map is
not present. Check for its presence; if it is not there or if you
don't want it to be built, comment it out of the Makefile.</p><p>If you want users to be able to change their passwords on the
client machines instead of only on the server, you must run the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpc.yppasswdd</b></span> daemon. It comes
with the NIS server and has good documentation. All it has to do is
run at boot time after ypserv starts up.</p><p>Now the setup is done. Reboot your machine, and when it comes
back up, use <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> to make sure
ypserv and rpc.yppasswdd are running. If they are, clients should
be able to connect. There are only a few final notes before moving
on to client setup. First, remember that the NIS maps are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same as the local configuration files,
even though they are created from them. Each time you change a
local file such as /etc/passwd or /etc/netgroup, you need to
rebuild the NIS maps by going into /var/yp and running make. You
might want to set up a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job to
do this once an hour in case you make some changes but forget to
rebuild. Second, if you want to be able to see the NIS maps on your
server, you will have to configure it as a client. Follow the steps
in the next section to do so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x1295058"></a>Setting Up an NIS Client</h2></div></div><p>I will describe how to set up NIS on a Linux machine running
the Red Hat 4.2 distribution. However, what I cover is generally
applicable to any Linux machine running a libc5-based system with
the <span   class="bold"><b>NYS</b></span> NIS support library
included in the libc (as the case is with Red Hat), or a new libc6
system. If you are unfortunate enough not to fall into either of
these cases, I suggest upgrading your Linux distributions across
the board, or going out and getting a different libc at
sunsite.unc.edu. (Upgrading libc is not a task for the
faint-of-heart.)</p><p>The two packages required to make Red Hat Linux into an NIS
client are <span   class="bold"><b>yp-clients-2.2</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ypbind-3.3</b></span>. These tools start with
the letters &ldquo;yp&rdquo; for historical reasons. If you want to get the
tar.gz files, they are available at
ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/linux/local/yp/. Otherwise, you can use
pre-packaged RPMs from any Red Hat FTP site. The
<span   class="bold"><b>yp-clients</b></span> package is in the
standard binary RPMS directory, but the
<span   class="bold"><b>ypbind</b></span> package is only available
in the &ldquo;contrib/SRPMS&rdquo; area. You can run NIS without ypbind, but
not all features will be available. You will want those features
though, so get the RPM or source code, compile it and
install.</p><p>Once you have those packages installed, verify that you have
the portmapper running. The portmapper enables the Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) mechanism, which is used by NIS and NFS, among other
things. If you are already running NFS, you don't need to worry.
Otherwise, install the portmap package for your appropriate
distribution; it should be included.</p><p>Now that you have the various components installed, you must
set up a few configuration files to enable NIS at boot-time. First,
you have to determine the NIS domain in which the client will run.
This is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same thing as your DNS domain,
although sometimes the name is the same. The traditional location
for the NIS domain is in the file /etc/defaultdomain. This file
should contain a single line with the name of your NIS domain, for
example, <b  >econ.yale.edu</b>. However, this file's
mere presence does not set the domain name; to actually set the
name you must use the <span   class="bold"><b>domainname</b></span>
command. Usually this is done at boot time from the init scripts.
On Red Hat, add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
domainname `cat /etc/defaultdomain`
</pre><p>near the top of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit. On non-SYSV init
systems like Slackware, the appropriate file to change would most
likely be /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2. The main objective is to get
domainname to run &ldquo;early&rdquo; in the boot process, before other
network services that might depend on NIS run, but after the
network hardware is initialized and the IP address information is
set.
</p><p>Next, you have to start the ypbind daemon, which turns on the
NIS client services. If you installed the ypbind RPM referenced
above, the proper SYSV-style startup files should be ready to go.
Otherwise, you will have to start ypbind yourself. Insert the call
to /usr/sbin/ypbind right after the line initializing the NIS
domain name.</p><p>Third, create the file /etc/yp.conf and include the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ypserver
</pre><p>Replace
<b  ><i><tt>servername</tt></i></b> with the
host name of your NIS master or slave server, whose host name must
also be listed in /etc/hosts. You can list multiple servers on
separate lines; if one host is down at boot time, the client will
try the others. Failure to create this file will not disable NIS,
but ypbind will broadcast a request for a server across your entire
IP subnet, and this can be a major security hole. Someone can set
up a renegade NIS server on your subnet and then feed you false
configuration files. Better safe than sorry&mdash;create /etc/yp.conf.
</p><p>That wasn't too bad, was it? Now you're ready to go. Reboot
your machine, and when it comes back up, log in and do a few
diagnostics. First type <b  >domainname</b> without any
arguments to be sure that it responds with the proper NIS domain.
If not, check that the command to set the domain has run properly.
Then type <b  >ypwhich</b>, the command to tell you which
NIS server you are talking to. If all is well, it will respond with
the one you listed in the /etc/yp.conf file. Now it's time to put
NIS to work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x12958f0"></a>Common NIS Commands</h2></div></div><p>There are a number of useful command-line utilities, used to
query the NIS system, that come with the yp-clients package.
<span   class="bold"><b>ypwhich</b></span> tells you what NIS server
you are bound to. Typing the command
<b  >ypcat&nbsp;<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>
will display the contents of a file served over NIS. For example,
<b  >ypcat&nbsp;passwd</b> will display the NIS password
file. Typing the command
<b  >ypmatch&nbsp;<i><tt>key&nbsp;filename</tt></i></b>
will match a &ldquo;key&rdquo; in the file name specified. For instance, I
could do a <b  >ypmatch&nbsp;pbrown&nbsp;passwd</b>, and
it would return the entry for my account. These commands can be
useful in shell scripts, debugging NIS setup troubles and numerous
other creative ways.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x1295c60"></a>Setting Up nsswitch.conf</h2></div></div><p>The file used to tell your client computer which files to get
from NIS and which files to get locally from the hard disk is
called /etc/nsswitch.conf. This file is included with Red Hat
Linux, but if you don't have a copy, you should be able to obtain a
sample from a libc distribution or from the NIS-HOWTO. The file is
in the same format as the one from Solaris, so if you are familiar
with that one, you're a step ahead. If not, a short tutorial is
useful.</p><p>The nsswitch.conf file consists of entries in the following
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
filename:
</pre><p>The part of the line before the colon describes the file in
question, say passwd or group. The information after the colon
describes how that file should be obtained. Access methods we are
concerned with include <b  >nis</b>,
<b  >compat</b> and <b  >files</b>. The access
methods are cumulative; if multiple methods are specified, they
<span   class="emphasis"><em>add up</em></span> to create the final file. For instance,
the entry
<pre     class="programlisting">
passwd: files nis
</pre>


will first read the local password file, and then the NIS password
file, producing a conglomeration of the two. If there are duplicate
entries, the access methods coming first in the list take
precedence.
</p><p>Most likely, the lines all say <b  >files nisplus
nis</b> for the access methods. You don't have NIS+ running,
so that method will be skipped and all will be well&mdash;you will end
up with a combination of your local files and the NIS files, which
is probably what you desire. However, you may want finer control
over which entries users from the NIS file get added to your local
file. This is where the <b  >compat</b> access method
comes in.</p><p>If you list <b  >compat</b> as your sole access
method, a special syntax in the passwd and group files is enabled.
By default, the NIS version of the file isn't consulted; only the
local file is used. To add entries from the NIS file, you put lines
in the passwd/group file starting with a &ldquo;+&rdquo; character. For
instance, if I wanted to add the single user
<span   class="emphasis"><em>steveb</em></span> to my local passwd file, I would put
the following line at the end of the passwd file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
+steveb::::::
</pre><p>The colons are place holders for fields normally included in
the password file. Any information which is omitted will be filled
in from the NIS file. Here, I have omitted everything but the
user's name; all the other information (password, full-name field,
home, shell) will be replaced automatically by NIS. Similarly, if
you wanted to change steveb's shell on this computer, you might use
this line as his entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+steveb::::::/usr/local/bin/newshell
</pre>


All fields but the name and shell will be obtained via NIS. To
include everyone in the password file, you would include this
entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+::::::
</pre>


The lines for /etc/group are similar. If you enable the compat
access method for group, you could include individual groups by
including
<pre     class="programlisting">
+mygroup:::
</pre>


at the end of your group file. To include only a few users
(different from those listed in the NIS map) in the group, put a
line such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+mygroup:::steveb,pbrown,jrust
</pre>


where the included users are spelled out explicitly.
</p><p>Using a &ldquo;-&rdquo; character instead of a &ldquo;+&rdquo; character is also
possible, and does just what you would expect&mdash;it removes the
specified login(s) or group(s) from the file. The one warning is
that you must include &ldquo;-&rdquo; lines before any other line that might
include the user. For instance, if
<span   class="bold"><b>jrust</b></span> is included in the NIS
passwd file, and you want to remove him from the local computer but
give everyone else access, you would add these two lines to the end
of your passwd file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-jrust::::::
+::::::
</pre><p>Another common situation arises where you want to exclude
users from being able to login, but you want their information
available in the passwd file. For this, you would add the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+::::::/bin/false
</pre>


to the end of the passwd file, after previously including a few
privileged users like System Administrators. Since users logging in
will have no shell, they will be immediately kicked off, but all
their information will be available on the computer via
<span   class="bold"><b>ypcat</b></span> or the other NIS tools. One
note of warning&mdash;do not put any &ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;-&rdquo; lines at the
beginning of your passwd or group files or your computer will hang
at boot time. This may be fixed in libc6, but with libc5 it is a
problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x128cee8"></a>The netgroup File</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>netgroup</b></span> file gives
system administrators a powerful way for grouping users and hosts
into distinctive groups which can then be referenced when setting
up NIS access on the client computers. The netgroup file is
maintained on the NIS master server in /etc/netgroup. It consists
of the group name followed by one or more entries in the following
format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(
</pre><p>For instance, you might have a line like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sysadmins (,pbrown,) (,kbrown,) (,vladdy,) (,ieong,)
</pre>


This would place the four users listed into the netgroup
<b  >sysadmins</b>. You can then use this special group
in files such as /etc/passwd on the client using the &ldquo;+/-&rdquo;
notation. For instance, to allow the sysadmins group access to a
particular NIS client computer, but no one else, you would use an
entry at the end of the passwd file like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+@sysadmins
+:::::/bin/false
</pre>


Note that the netgroup name is preceded by the &ldquo;@&rdquo; character so
that NIS knows that this is a netgroup you are referring to and not
a normal user name.
</p><p>You can use netgroups for all sorts of creative things.
Create a netgroup with dangerous users listed in it and use a &ldquo;-&rdquo;
line in the passwd file to disallow them, but include everyone
else. Create netgroups for all the &ldquo;semi-private&rdquo; machines you
have on your network and list the valid users for those machines.
Include them in your passwd file to give just those users access.
The possibilities are almost endless.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x128d258"></a>Additional Details</h2></div></div><p>While for the most part, the fact that you are running NIS
instead of using traditional configuration files will be completely
transparent, there are a few cases where this is not true. The most
glaring of these is that you cannot use the passwd command to
change your password on the client machines. If you do so, the
entire NIS passwd map will be appended to the local /etc/passwd
file each time you use the command, which is certainly not the
intended effect. This may have changed with libc6, but it is
definitely a problem with the stock utilities that come with Red
Hat 4.2. However, all hope is not lost; there is a solution, and it
is called <span   class="bold"><b>yppasswd</b></span>. This utility
acts just like passwd, but makes a call to the NIS server to do the
actual change instead of trying to change things locally. The NIS
server must support this by running the
<span   class="bold"><b>yppasswdd</b></span> daemon. In its absence,
you will have to tell users to log in to the NIS server to change
their password, which is only a minor inconvenience.</p><p>If you run into troubles while setting up either the server
or clients, the most likely source of your problems is the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. Make sure that each line is creating the
behavior you intend, and when in doubt refer to the man page. Also,
check the &ldquo;+/-&rdquo; syntax in your passwd and group files and make
sure it follows the proper notation. Minor typos can have
wide-ranging effects, so proofread carefully.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot hope to cover all the details of
setting up a complex distributed network environment. You may well
have unique problems or concerns that haven't been addressed here.
If this is the case, I highly recommend the O'Reilly book on NIS
(and NFS) that was previously mentioned. If all of these roads lead
to nowhere, try the Linux, and especially the Sun, newsgroups on
Usenet. There is a good chance someone else has dealt with your
problem before.</p><p>Good luck setting up NIS on your Linux network. The couple of
hours you initially invest will save you days of headaches in the
long run.</p></div></div>
