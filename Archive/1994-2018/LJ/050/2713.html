<i  >LJ</i>, is a software package that lets a UNIX or
Linux system provide file and print services for Windows clients,
including Windows for WorkGroups, Windows 95, Windows NT, and OS-2
and, for that matter, UNIX using
<span   class="bold"><b>smbclient</b></span> or Linux using that or
the Linux SMB file system. It earns lots of interoperability points
for Linux, allowing a Linux system to earn its keep as a file
server in a Windows shop, instead of the more costly, and perhaps
less robust, Windows NT server.</p><p>For some years I have administered such a Samba installation.
From that experience, I can say with great enthusiasm that Samba is
a fine package&mdash;proof that free software can achieve
commercial-or-better quality. Once installed, it is simple and easy
to use; so much so, I've even seen Samba used to share user home
directories between Linux hosts. Unfortunately, the ones who
witness my enthusiasm for this software too often say, &ldquo;Yes, it
sounds great, if only I could manage to configure it.&rdquo;</p><p>Samba configuration, especially the initial configuration, is
not always a breeze. While sample configuration files, offering
good starting points, are provided in the source tree, there remain
many parameters to set or tune. These parameters reflect in part
the significant complexity underlying Microsoft networking, and in
part the difficulties of mapping the Microsoft file system and
security model to the UNIX models, with their corresponding wealth
of alternate solutions that offer various tradeoffs.</p><p>There is a lot of information in Samba's man pages and source
tree /docs directory. However, this information isn't highly
integrated, notwithstanding some nice HTML pages, and it is by no
means complete.</p><p>When I first installed Samba, there was less information than
now but it was still substantial. It took me a week of browsing
through it, off and on, before I was ready to attempt my first
Samba configuration. I remember thinking several times as I
struggled to master this information and the gaps in it, &ldquo;I wish
there was a good book on Samba.&rdquo; Now there is.</p><p>Written by John D. Blair, who has been made a member of the
Samba team, all the snippets of information in the Samba source
tree are combined in a single volume. (The Samba Team helped out by
providing last minute information and editing.) More, lots of
information that never found its way to the source tree is
collected here. For example, Chapter 2 gives an introduction to SMB
(service message block networking protocol), including some
discussion of protocol details. This chapter contributes much
toward understanding the context in which Samba operates.</p><p>Well-organized and well-indexed, this book guides the reader
through a UNIX-eye tour of Windows networking concepts, terms and
history, past the unpacking and building of the package, and into
the complexities of configuring, testing and troubleshooting an
installation. The Table of Contents, nine pages long, contains
enough detail to avoid many trips to the extensive index.</p><p>You will find discussions of network service browsing, name
resolution, performance, authentication and access control, name
mangling, multiple subnets, a very thorough chapter on problem
diagnosis, and a whole chapter at the end devoted to the SMB file
system.</p><p>Chapters 5 and 6 talk about the configuration parameters
found in the main Samba configuration file, /etc/smb.conf. Perhaps
the most important chapters for the working system administrator,
each begins with an outline and its own index. This is a nice touch
and potentially saves a lot of flipping back and forth to the main
index or the Table of Contents. Options are grouped in these
chapters by goal, rather than alphabetically as in the man pages,
helping the reader draw connections between related options. Much
of my week of browsing, when I first installed this software, was
devoted to drawing connections between options.</p><p>The book comes complete with a CD-ROM containing
Samba-1.9.18. This may be helpful for evaluating Samba; however, if
you find this software useful, you should check the web site. At
the time of writing this review (March), Samba-1.9.18p3 was
current. No doubt a few more patches will be released between now
and the time you read it.</p><p>Mr. Blair apparently felt obligated to include information on
using both 1.9.17, which required the U.S. export-controlled DES
library, <span   class="bold"><b>libdes</b></span>, and 1.9.18, which
includes exportable limited-DES hashing code. You may already be
familiar with the peculiar U.S. laws regarding export of encryption
software. Even encryption software featuring the venerable and
well-known DES algorithms, software written outside the US and
freely available around the globe, is affected by these
laws.</p><p>The Samba team has found a solution that may avoid the issue.
Samba now includes the DES algorithm, in the form of a dedicated
implementation used only to calculate a hash value as its
output&mdash;this value cannot easily be deciphered to provide the
original input. This method is apparently exempt from
classification as encryption software. In any case, there are no
obvious export restrictions on the present version, and the
necessity of obtaining a DES library to link Samba against is
avoided.</p><p>Having encryption support is nice, as it avoids multiple
re-entry of passwords when signing onto NT. Without it, Samba
shares that are marked for automatic network mount on NT login will
result in your being asked to enter your password repeatedly, a
situation that becomes quite frustrating. With encrypted password
support, if you use the same Samba password on the server and
locally on your NT system, you'll be prompted for your password
only once when you sign on to NT.</p><p>The book covers the use of libdes with Samba-1.9.17, at some
length, in several places. In each, there are words which sound
like afterthoughts, to the effect that none of this is necessary
with 1.9.18. I'd rather have seen this 1.9.17 information moved out
of the way to an Appendix.</p><p>This is a minor blemish, however. I have enjoyed reading this
book in its galley proofs, and it has helped me in a recent upgrade
of several Linux systems from Samba-1.9.16 to the current version.
I look forward to obtaining this book in its final printed
form.</p><p>I believe <span   class="emphasis"><em>SAMBA: Integrating UNIX and
Windows</em></span> will be of great assistance to those who like to
get started with a good book. Use of the Samba software, combined
with the information contained in this book, will enable Linux to
continue to establish a foothold in mostly-Windows shops for use as
a file server.</p></div></div>
