    Don't want to learn CGI but still want dynamic web pages?
    Mr. Lerner introduces us to server-side includes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18fd4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most web sites contain largely static
HTML files jazzed up with some images. More advanced sites use one
or more CGI programs, HTTP cookies, database backends and other
topics we have discussed in previous months.
</p><p>All of these techniques involve creating at least one new
process on the web server. If we are interested in keeping our
server's load as low as possible, we should avoid creating
unnecessary processes. I am not suggesting we remove CGI
programs&mdash;but I am saying there are times when CGI might be
overkill.</p><p>Sometimes, for instance, you can do everything you need with
server-side includes, also known as &ldquo;SSIs&rdquo;. SSIs offer a good
balance between efficiency and complexity. Even if you have never
seen them, server-side includes are pretty easy to understand.
Indeed, they are often ideal for giving non-programmers a taste of
dynamic page output without confusing them with the problems
associated with actual programming. Here is one example of what
they look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!--#printenv --&gt;
</pre><p>Yes, this looks like an HTML comment. But unlike an HTML
comment, which is passed along to the user's browser unmodified,
SSIs are parsed by the server before the file is sent off. It might
be easier to think of SSIs as macros that are expanded by the web
server.
</p><p>Each server-side include begins with the &ldquo;open comment&rdquo;
characters (<b  >"&lt;!--"</b>), a hash mark
(<b  >"#"</b>) immediately following the two dashes, the
name of the command you wish to evaluate, whitespace, zero or more
attribute value pairs followed by whitespace and finally the
&ldquo;close comment&rdquo; characters (<b  >"--&gt;"</b>). So the
SSI command <b  >#printenv</b>, which takes no arguments
and returns the list of environment variables, could be contained
in the following file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Testing&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Testing&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;!--#printenv --&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Before sending the above document to a user, it would be
expanded into something resembling <a href="2919l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>. Notice how our simple SSI was replaced by a list of
environment variables and their values. While there is no standard
for server-side includes, servers share a common list of SSIs with
each server defining new ones.</p><p>This month, we will look into server-side includes&mdash;from
configuring your server to allow for them, to some different SSI
commands you might wish to use on your web site, to a number of
ways in which to use SSIs on your site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18fda28"></a>Configuring Apache for SSIs</h2></div></div><p>Before you can actually create pages containing and using
server-side includes, you must configure your web server to allow
for them. If you are compiling Apache from scratch, make sure that
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_include</b></span>, the module that takes
care of SSIs, is compiled into the server. (By default, it should
be.)</p><p>Even if mod_include exists, you must configure several
additional items. First, you must tell Apache you wish to allow
SSIs by using the <b  >Options</b> directive in the
server configuration file.</p><p>On my Red Hat 4.2 system, the file containing this
information is called /etc/httpd/conf/access.conf, and the line
looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
</pre><p>This indicates that I have decided to activate three of
Apache's options&mdash;<b  >Indexes</b> (producing a directory
listing if a user asks for a directory rather than a file),
<b  >FollowSymLinks</b> (telling Apache to follow
symbolic links, rather than ignoring them), and
<b  >Includes</b> (meaning server-side includes should be
active).
</p><p>If you would prefer to stop users from using
<b  >#exec</b>, which allows them to run arbitrary
external programs, replace <b  >Includes</b> with
<b  >IncludesNOEXEC</b>, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks IncludesNOEXEC
</pre><p>If you wish to allow SSIs in only one directory, modify the
configuration file so that the <b  >Options</b> line
appears between <b  >&lt;Directory&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/Directory&gt;</b> lines. For example, if we
only want files in the /ssi directory to allow for server-side
includes, we could give this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /home/httpd/html/ssi/&gt;
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>


The Apache documentation also describes how you can have several
<b  >&lt;Directory&gt;</b> blocks. If your server hosts
several sub-sites, you can use them to define different services
for different sub-sites, depending on who is running them, how much
they have paid or what policies you wish to have in place.
</p><p>We indicate which files might contain SSIs by using two
additional directives in the srm.conf configuration file. The
first, <b  >AddType</b>, indicates what sort of
content-type header should be sent when the server returns a
document with an .shtml suffix. Browsers need to know how to
interpret the data being sent to them&mdash;it could, after all, be an
image in JPEG format, text in HTML format or completely unformatted
data. We thus add the following line to our configuration
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AddType text/html .shtml
</pre><p>However, that's not quite enough; we also want files to be
parsed by the server on their way out the door. This is done by
instructing Apache to use the &ldquo;server-parsed&rdquo; handler on all
files with &ldquo;.shtml&rdquo; as the suffix. We can do this by adding the
following line to the srm.conf file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</pre>


and then restarting the server.
</p><p>You might be wondering why we must use .shtml, rather than
.html. Why not add a server-parsed handler for .html, and dispense
with the separate extension?</p><p>The answer has to do with server efficiency. SSIs have less
computational overhead than CGI programs, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> is not <span   class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span>. If we
were to tell Apache that all HTML files might include SSIs, Apache
would have to inspect every .html file, which might slow things
down significantly. Thus, it is customary on many sites to divide
files into two categories&mdash;those containing only HTML (with the
.html suffix), and those containing HTML plus server-side includes
(with the .shtml suffix). The only difference to users is the file
extension they eventually see, since SSIs are replaced by their
results before they are sent to the user's browser. Both are sent
with a content-type of &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;, since our
<b  >AddHandler</b> directive instructs Apache to do
so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18fe580"></a>Using Server-Side Includes</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have told Apache how to handle SSIs, we can start
to use them in our files. Once again, only those files with .shtml
suffixes will be parsed by Apache's server-side include mechanism,
so make sure to save your files with an .shtml suffix, rather than
with an .html suffix.</p><p>As we saw above, server-side includes look like HTML
comments. This means any server-side includes not parsed by Apache
will be invisible to the end user. Even if the SSI is passed
unmodified to the user's browser (because of an error or a
misconfigured server), there won't be any problems or oddities in
what the user sees.</p><p>One of the most common uses of SSIs is to indicate when a
document was modified. This is useful when a page is updated
regularly; a typical example might be a news service or events
calendar.</p><p>Here is a file indicating its latest modification date. We
print the date with the SSI <b  >#echo</b> command, which
prints the value of an SSI variable. SSI variables include
environment variables, plus several others defined by Apache. In
this example, we look at <b  >LAST_MODIFIED</b>, which
contains the date and time of when the file was changed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;I was modified&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;I was modified&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I was last modified on
&lt;!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" --&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>If you have followed the instructions so far, retrieving this
page should indicate when it was last modified. Remember to save
the file with an extension of .shtml&mdash;while writing this column, I
spent some time trying to figure out why one particular SSI wasn't
working. As it turns out, the problem was with the file extension,
not my server.
</p><p>The date printed by <b  >#echo</b> might look nice
to programmers, but it is a little daunting for most people.
Non-programmers would prefer a slightly more familiar date and time
format.</p><p>Fortunately, Apache allows us to modify the way in which
dates are displayed. C programmers are probably familiar with the
<span   class="bold"><b>strftime</b></span> function, which allows
for the creation of many different time and date strings by using
characters preceded by percent signs (%). For example, &ldquo;%A&rdquo; gives
us the name of a day, &ldquo;%B&rdquo; returns the name of a month, &ldquo;%d&rdquo;
gives the day of the month and &ldquo;%Y&rdquo; returns the four-digit year.
Thus by specifying &ldquo;%A, %d %B %Y&rdquo;, we can get a string that looks
like &ldquo;Wednesday, February 22 1998&rdquo;.</p><p>Here is an example of setting the date to American format,
first using the &ldquo;config&rdquo; SSI, and then using the &ldquo;echo&rdquo; SSI to
display the results in our new format.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Testing&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Testing&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;!--#config timefmt="%m/%d/%y" --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In America, I was changed on
&lt;!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Already, we can see a pattern in how server-side includes are
defined and used. They consist of a keyword and then one or more
attribute,value pairs, just as in this example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Testing&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Testing&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;!--#config timefmt="%m/%d/%y" --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In America, I was changed on
&lt;!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"
--&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#config timefmt="%d/%m/%y" --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Europe, I was changed on
&lt;!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"
--&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18febb0"></a>Importing Other Files</h2></div></div><p>Printing a file's modification date is fine if you are
running a continuously updated news service, but it does not have
many other applications. By contrast, I find the file-inclusion SSI
functions are extremely useful when designing sites.</p><p>The syntax is quite simple, as you can see from this
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;A basic template&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;!--#include virtual="/fragments/header.htmlf"
--&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the text of my page, sandwiched between
two server-side includes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#include virtual="/fragments/footer.htmlf"
--&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Here, we use <b  >#include</b>, with a single
argument named &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;. Apache replaces the contents of this
SSI with the contents of the named file. This might not seem all
that useful, but consider how easy this makes it to create a site
with a uniform look. The header.htmlf fragment could contain the
standard <b  >&lt;Body&gt;</b> tag, defining text and
background colors, as well as putting a menu bar across the top of
the page. By the same token, the footer.htmlf fragment could
contain a copyright notice, smaller menu bar or information about
the server.
</p><p>What is the advantage? When you decide to add a new button to
the menu bar or when the site's sponsors move to a new address, you
only need to modify a single file. The changes propagate
automatically through the rest of the site. This is easier than
changing each individual page, and more efficient than creating the
page with a CGI program. Just as you can avoid programming errors
by putting repeated instructions into a subroutine, so too you can
avoid typos and other potential problems by putting repeated
information into HTML fragments that are imported with the
&ldquo;include&rdquo; SSI.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18f5758"></a>Tips and Tricks When Including Files</h2></div></div><p>If your site uses CGI programs to create dynamic pages, you
might be tempted to include your standard headers and footers in
the programs' output using <b  >#include</b>.
Unfortunately, because CGI programs and SSIs use different
handlers, there isn't any way for this to work. If you decide to
use HTML fragments as headers and footers, you might want to define
some short subroutines that can be included in your CGI
programs.</p><p>Also, because different handlers are used for SSIs
(&ldquo;server-parsed&rdquo;) and CGI programs (&ldquo;cgi-script&rdquo;), you cannot
include server-side includes in the output from CGI programs and
expect them to be interpreted. If you decide to create a uniform
look and feel for your site using HTML fragments (described below),
any CGI programs you write will be able to include those fragments.
If you write CGI programs in Perl, such a subroutine could look
like <a href="2919l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. Your CGI programs
would then look like <a href="2919l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.
Now when you change header.htmlf or footer.htmlf, all output on the
server&mdash;from HTML files and CGI programs alike&mdash;will immediately
reflect the changes.</p><p>In case you are wondering, fragments are imported verbatim,
and any SSIs they might contain are passed along as HTML comments.
Assume we defined header.htmlf to be the following two-line
fragment:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;This is the header.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#printenv --&gt;
</pre><p>If this fragment were retrieved directly through Apache, the
<b  >#printenv</b> SSI would print the current list of
environment variables. But since header.htmlf is imported via a
<b  >#include</b> SSI, the <b  >#printenv</b>
function is sent to the user's browser uninterpreted. This might
seem unnecessary, until you consider that allowing SSIs inside of
included files might lead to infinite loops or other unexpected
results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18f5bd0"></a>Variables and Conditionals</h2></div></div><p>One of the more interesting recent additions to server-side
includes is a limited programming language allowing for the setting
and testing of variables.</p><p>Setting variables is fairly simple; you can do it with the
following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!--#set var="varname" value="value" --&gt;
</pre><p>You can see the results with <b  >#echo</b> (for a
specific list of variables) or <b  >#printenv</b> (for
all defined variables), as in the following example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Setting variables&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;!--#set var="pi" value="3.14159" --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!--#printenv --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;P&gt;pi = &lt;!--#echo var="pi" --&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;!--#set var="e" value="2.71828"
--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!--#printenv --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;P&gt;e = &lt;!--#echo var="e"
--&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>


The above example also demonstrates how SSIs are interpreted in the
same order as they appear in the file. The output from
<b  >#printenv</b> changes after each variable setting.
</p><p>Setting variables is useful when used in conjunction with
<b  >if-then</b> statements. These statements can be used
to create conditional text within HTML files without having to use
CGI programs. The syntax is rather simple, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!--#if expr="$SERVER_PORT=80"
--&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You are using server port 80&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#else --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You are using a non-standard server port&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#endif --&gt;
</pre><p>Note that the variable name in an <b  >#if</b>
statement must be preceded by a dollar sign, much as with shell
scripts. The <b  >#else</b> statement is optional, but
the <b  >#endif</b> is mandatory, indicating the end of
the conditional text.
</p><p>You can even perform pattern-matching within variables, using
regular expressions, as in the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Browser check&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;!--#if expr="$HTTP_USER_AGENT = /^Mozilla/"
--&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You are using Netscape&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#else --&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You are using another browser&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;!--#endif --&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>If the value of HTTP_USER_AGENT (normally set to a string
identifying the user's browser) is set to
<pre     class="programlisting">
Mozilla/4.04 [en] (X11; I; Linux 2.0.30 i586; Nav)
</pre>


as is the case on my system, the above will evaluate to &ldquo;true&rdquo;,
and thus print the first string. Otherwise, it will print the
second string. In this way, you can create menus customized for
each browser. For instance, you could make life easier for users of
Lynx (a text-only browser) by giving them a separate menu structure
that does not rely on images.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1805580.0x18f6308"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Server-side includes do not solve all problems&mdash;but what
software does? Rather, SSIs were created so that non-programmers
could create dynamic output. Over time, they have expanded to the
point where they can now include conditional statements, which are
a first step toward actual programming. As we have seen, though,
programmers can benefit from many of SSI's features, especially
when it comes to including simple information inside of pages of
HTML, such as standard headers or a file's last modification
date.</p><p>There are a number of other commands available from within
SSIs, including <b  >#exec</b>, which allows you to run a
program and incorporate its output into a page of HTML. (You can
also use <b  >#include</b> to bring in the output from a
CGI program, even if you use <b  >IncludesNOEXEC</b>
rather than <b  >Includes</b> in the Apache
configuration.)</p><p>In some cases, though, such simple server-side includes might
not be enough. Over the next few months, we will look at several
software packages that take the idea of server-side includes one
step further, making a complete programming language available
inside of HTML files without the need for CGI programs.</p><p><a href="2919s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
