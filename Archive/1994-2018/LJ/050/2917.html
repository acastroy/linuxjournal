I found pthread.h in /usr/include/, but I didn't find libthread.a
in /usr/lib/ as I can in AIX. &mdash;Ju Rao Slackware</p><p>There is an excellent threads library available called
LinuxThreads. You can download the latest version from
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/cristal/Xavier.Leroy/. [For more
information on LinuxThreads, see

question. I upgraded the kernel from version 1.2. Now when I run
games, I get an error about a missing svgalib. Consequently, I
cannot get any picture. I am using an ATI 3D Expression with 2MB.
How do I edit the config or lib file in order to indicate which
libraries I have? &mdash;Jonathan Barrie Slackware</p><p>I'll bet you upgraded the libraries as well as the kernel.
Nowadays, everything uses shared libraries, and programs can't run
unless the right shared libraries are installed.</p><p>I'd try <b  >ldd &lt;program&gt;</b> to check which
libraries it finds and which it doesn't. Once you know which
libraries are missing, you can then install the Slackware packages
that provide them.</p><p>You can also run <b  >ldconfig -v</b> to see which
libraries are installed; if your program looks for a different
version of a library already installed, look for &ldquo;backward
compatibility&rdquo; packages.</p><p>Note that newer distributions trace dependencies between
packets, so you are unlikely to experience this error when using
them.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0e558"></a>Customizing Login Screens</h2></div></div><p>How do I customize the &ldquo;Login&rdquo; screens for TELNET and FTP
  logins? &mdash;Robert Farrell</p><p>For TELNET, create and edit the /etc/issue.net file with
whatever you wish to be displayed for the login screen. You can
also edit the /etc/motd file to display the message of the day
after someone logs in.</p><p>For FTP, go to the root directory of the FTP space (usually
/home/ftp/). You can verify the location and file names by looking
in /etc/ftpaccess. Edit the welcome.msg file to whatever you wish
to be displayed. If you want specific messages to be displayed when
users enter into a particular directory, edit the .message file in
that directory. &mdash;Mark Bishop mark@tct-net.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0e710"></a>Backup Scheme</h2></div></div><p>In a 50/50-mixed NT/Linux LAN of four to six servers, what is
the best tape backup scheme you recommend? Where should I install
the backup units&mdash;on the NT or Linux or both? What tape backup
utilities should I use? What if Solaris 2.5 servers are added?  &mdash;Jon
ChunRed Hat</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> has always been the
standard backup tool in the UNIX environment. If you want something
more powerful, you should investigate
<span   class="bold"><b>cpio</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>afio</b></span>, both of which are standard,
command-line tools. BRU and other commercial backup facilities
exist as well.</p><p>If you want to back up mixed NT and UNIX systems, you will
most likely need to use a dedicated backup facility for the NT
servers. A backup of NT is nice but backing up your domain server
won't be very useful unless you include the registry settings,
which only an NT backup tool can do.</p><p>The best possible solution is to install a tape drive in each
server and use that server's own tools (NTBackup on NT, tar on
UNIX) to back it up. That method will provide you with the fastest
recovery times as you won't be restoring across the LAN.</p><p>If you don't need to cut costs, you can investigate ARCServe
or another commercial backup utility. These tools include clients
for many platforms, and you can probably get the SCO client working
under Linux using iBCS2. That would allow you to use a Windows NT
machine to back up your UNIX servers. &mdash;Chad
Robinson chadr@brt.com</p><p>You can use the SMBFS functionality of the Linux kernel in
order to mount remote NT servers on your Linux system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
smbmount //NT_SERVER//FOO /nt_server
</pre><p>Then you can save these directories with tar or any
other backup utility.
</p><p>A more efficient solution (but not free) is to use commercial
software such as ARKEIA or BRU which support remote NT/95 system
backups. &mdash;Pierre Ficheux, Lectra

Linux. After looking around a bit I found a driver in the Red Hat
distribution. So, I compiled a new kernel with support for the
Teles card. However, I have no idea how to use it. With a standard
modem I can talk with <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> commands
to /dev/modem/, but how does it work with the ISDN card? &mdash;Rien
Broekstra Red Hat</p><p>You need the isdn4k-utils. There are other packages, e.g.,
vbox for building an answering machine, but this is basic. Check
ftp://ftp.franken.de/ or read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn/*
for locations of additional packages. &mdash;Ralf W.
Stephan stephan@tmt.de</p><p>I'm fairly certain that you didn't need to recompile your
kernel. The Red Hat kernel packages build ISDN support as modules.
(I'm sure they do as of 5.0, and I think we did in 4.2 as
well.)</p><p>Anyway, the best place to find this type of information is in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax/. Everything you
need should be covered there. &mdash;Donnie

strictly as an e-mail server with Netscape as the client. I have
noticed that my free disk space has been shrinking over the year.
Looking around, I found a whole boatload of files in the /tmp
directory which appear to be mail messages with graphic
attachments. The file names are pop3a0XXXX and many of them are the
same size, have the same owner and have creation dates 2-5 minutes
apart. How do I fix this? Does the in.pop3d have a problem? &mdash;Mike
Gasiorowski mgaz@blue.friendswood.isd.tenet.edu Slackware
</p><p>It looks like your daemon is losing its temporary files; this
can happen when users hang up without closing the connection. (Even
though the user is causing it to happen, it should still be
considered a bug.)</p><p>The easiest solution to the problem is to use
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> to do a periodic check of
/tmp with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

within an extended partition of my DOS system. Is this possible in
Linux? If so, how do I mount them? Thanks for your help. &mdash;Andrew
Hamlin Slackware
</p><p>Yes, this is possible. When Linux boots, you receive a
message describing the partitions found on each drive. You can
review these messages after Linux boots using the
<span   class="bold"><b>dmesg</b></span> utility.</p><p>Primary partitions are numbered from 1-4, for example,
<b  >hda3</b>. Extended partitions will be numbered from
5 and up, so the first extended partition on drive
<b  >hda</b> will be <b  >hda5</b>. Add an
entry for this drive to your /etc/fstab file, and you will be able
to mount it. You can test this manually by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
