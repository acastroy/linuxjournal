familiar with only GUIs can have a hard time adjusting to the
plethora of typed commands. Those familiar primarily with control
panels suddenly have to edit /etc files with strange syntaxes that
vary from file to file. Even DOS users, used to typing commands and
editing configuration files, can find the sheer power Linux places
in even the average user's hands a bit daunting.</p><p>What new users need, then, is a friendly guide to show them
the ropes. They need a tome that gives a broad overview of what
they can do with this new operating system they've been hearing so
much about, but that doesn't go into such depth as to scare them
away. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX: Installation, Configuration, Use</em></span>
(first published in Germany as <span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX: Installation,
Konfiguration, Anwendung</em></span>) is a very good starting
point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0d580.0x2b05df0"></a>Making the Switch</h2></div></div><p>This book is aimed primarily at experienced users of other
environments, such as DOS or Windows&mdash;people who know how to turn
their computer on and off, who know how to get what they want out
of what they already have and a little more besides, and are now
ready to try something new.</p><p>The book has a surprising breadth of topics and gives what I
think is just the right amount of depth for its purpose: a general
overview of how to put a Linux system into practical use. In every
area, it gives the user enough information to get him going, and
then a little more to make it clear that any limitations are with
the scope of the book and not the capabilities of the environment.
It then points the reader to resources needed to go further.</p><p>The book begins, appropriately enough, with a brief
description of Linux's history, along with an overview of what's
available for Linux, and what sorts of things&mdash;both technologically
and philosophically&mdash;make Linux unique. From there it moves
immediately into the realm of the practical, walking the user
through the first installation of Linux on his system.</p><p>The Installation chapter covers several different scenarios,
but focuses primarily on a single distribution: Red Hat 4.1. This
distribution is included on a CD with the book&mdash;a common enough
occurrence&mdash;so the book tends to fall back on Red Hat when giving
specific examples. Other distributions&mdash;notably Debian, Slackware,
Caldera and S.u.S.E.&mdash;are mentioned, and significant differences
are dealt with.</p><p>Installation taken care of, the author moves right along to a
whirlwind tour of UNIX in general and Linux in particular. This
section goes into no particular depth, but rather gives a
rapid-fire overview of the basic utilities and programs a user
should become familiar with, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>emacs</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and X. Before diving further
into the nitty-gritty, the author makes it clear where a user can
find all the extensive on-line documentation&mdash;both from the
included CD and also information available on the Net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0d580.0x2b06160"></a>Making it Work</h2></div></div><p>The section on configuration opens with a discussion of file
management under Linux. Here again, the assumption is that the user
is at least somewhat familiar with the concepts behind other
command-line interfaces, such as DOS, although I don't believe a
complete newbie would be lost. The section goes into how Linux
structures file systems, how permissions work, the basics of
administering users and groups and coping with removable
media.</p><p>Following this is a peek at the actual innards of file
systems&mdash;not in much detail, but enough to whet the appetite of a
curious novice. Process administration comes next, followed by a
discussion of library-related issues, including some
troubleshooting tips for shared libraries. Finally, the
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> daemon and its importance are
described in some detail before moving on to the topic of
configuration.</p><p>The basic configuration and administration chapter starts
with simple things&mdash;keyboard configuration; configuration of BASH,
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span> and Emacs; setting the time,
that sort of thing. It then walks the user through setting up new
accounts, and moves on to a description of how to administer file
systems. Next comes a discussion of LPD, followed by network
configuration. The chapter concludes with a detailed section on
tailoring the boot process, and a walk-through of how to recompile
the Linux kernel.</p><p>The section on configuration concludes with a description of
the X Window System, focusing on XFree86 3.1.2 (the version on the
disk). All of the basic configuration issues are discussed here,
including the importance of getting the monitor settings right so
that you don't accidentally fry your screen. An overview of window
managers is provided, covering several flavors of FVWM, TWM and
OLWM. The section concludes with a quick overview of X
Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0d580.0x2b06420"></a>Making it Useful</h2></div></div><p>The third section of the book focuses on teaching someone how
to actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the system. An entire chapter
is devoted to the bash shell and the basics of writing bash
scripts. Following this is a 50-page command reference, covering
just about every executable that comes with the standard Red Hat
distribution.</p><p>Having established the environment one executes commands in
and the commands one can execute, subsequent chapters cover the use
of specific programs. First comes a chapter on tools and utilities,
including Midnight Commander, various PostScript tools,
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xgrab</b></span>.</p><p>After this, an entire chapter is devoted to Emacs, starting
with the basics of finding your way around the editor and going
right up through advanced issues like macros. Next comes a chapter
on LaTeX2E, again starting with the basics but ultimately at least
touching on more advanced features. Between these two chapters, the
user is left with enough information to begin word
processing&mdash;albeit in a non-WYSIWYG environment&mdash;under
Linux.</p><p>This section finishes with an extremely useful overview of
how to get a Linux box up and running on the network. In addition
to holding the user's hand through the dreadful process of setting
up a PPP script and other such details, the book provides an
overview of web, FTP, TELNET, e-mail and news clients available for
Linux. The section on e-mail even covers sendmail configuration,
and includes instructions for setting up a machine to use
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>popclient</b></span> to send and retrieve
mail from a remote system using PPP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0d580.0x2b067e8"></a>Going Further</h2></div></div><p>Finally, the book spends about 100 pages showing the user
several different environments in which he can write programs&mdash;the
real power of the Linux environment. Rather than delving into the
mysteries of C and C++, this section focuses on more &ldquo;mundane&rdquo;
environments&mdash;bash, Tcl/Tk and Emacs Lisp. In all three cases, the
emphasis is more on giving the user enough information to extend
his day-to-day working environment, rather than on extensive
programming.</p><p>The book winds up with a set of appendices that cover the
vagaries of various distributions and deal with updates since the
original, German edition of the book was published.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0d580.0x2b06948"></a>A Tough Job (But Someone Has to Do It)</h2></div></div><p>This kind of book cannot be easy to write and must have been
even harder to translate. That said, I think Mr. Kofler and whoever
translated the book from its original German have done a fairly
good job. I've been administering and programming UNIX systems of
various stripes for years and have been running Linux both at home
and at work on a daily basis for quite some time. I still found Mr.
Kofler's book immediately useful, enabling me to easily tackle a
couple of issues I'd been putting off, waiting for a block of
learning time.</p><p>I have, I think, only two complaints about the book. The
first is that it's already slightly out of date: Red Hat 4.1 is
over a year old. On the other hand, Red Hat 4.1 is also a solid
release&mdash;it's the release I was already running on my laptop, and
I've had very few problems with it. However, some things made the
age of this release noticeable. For example, the section on setting
up an automated script to dial in with PPP, send queued mail,
retrieve mail from a POP box and disconnect, was very useful. But
it relied on an older POP program&mdash;popclient&mdash;rather than the newer
and more broadly useful (not to mention supported)
<span   class="bold"><b>fetchmail</b></span>.</p><p>The second complaint is that the translation to English is
not quite as good as it could be. There's nothing embarrassing
about the translation; it's just not quite fluid sometimes. Many
readers won't even notice, but as a copy editor, I do.</p><p>As an example, on page 141, preparing to describe how to
break up a Linux system into multiple partitions, I found this
sentence: &ldquo;The creation of additional Linux partitions is a
far-reaching intervention in the Linux system.&rdquo; Now, there's
nothing <span   class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span> with that sentence, from either
a syntactic or a semantic point of view, but the choice of words
(&ldquo;far-reaching intervention&rdquo;) seems a little strange. I found
things like this a bit distracting, but again, that may be because
I look for them as a matter of habit.</p><p>Overall, I found this book extremely useful with a very
positive attitude and a wide range of topics covered. As both a
step-by-step guide and a reference, it is a good place for an
aspiring Linux user to start.</p></div></div>
