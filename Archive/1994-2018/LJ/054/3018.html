The concept of Linux kernel modules is fairly simple.
Unfortunately, information needed to compile, install and use
modules is scattered over several HOWTOs, READMEs, and man pages.
Plus, the files which need to be modified are in several obscure
directories.
</p><p>I finally wrote this cookbook approach to get myself, and
you, started. Once you are up and running with modules, you can dig
into the details later. I tested this material on an X86 processor
running Caldera Open Linux 1.1, which is close to Red Hat 4.2. Your
mileage with other processors and distributions may vary.</p><p>Why use modules? They let you compile a small, fast kernel,
then install and remove device drivers on demand. Without modules,
the Linux kernel could become bloated and resemble a certain
commercial OS.</p><p>First, I recommend you compile a base kernel including all
essential capabilities for your system without modules. I know this
sounds like we are going backwards, but you don't want to lose the
ability to boot up because you messed up your modules. The README
in /usr/src/linux is your guide, but basically you execute the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make mrproper; make xconfig
</pre><p>(or <b  >menuconfig</b> or
<b  >config</b>) to include all needed capabilities, then
run:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make dep; make clean; make zImage
</pre>


Save your kernel configuration to a file named kernelconf.base, in
case you need to recompile. The xconfig menu prompts you to save
and load configuration files. If you use menuconfig or config, the
current configuration is in the file /usr/src/linux/.config; copy
that file to kernelconf.base. If you configured too big a kernel,
final compilation will fail. If this happens, execute
<b  >make&nbsp;bzImage</b> instead of
<b  >zImage</b>. Your compiled kernel will be in the
directory /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot.
</p><p>You might have made a mistake in compiling your base kernel,
so don't throw away your old one. If you are running LILO, rename
your new kernel to zImage.base and copy it to the location of your
current kernel, usually / or /boot. Add a section to /etc/lilo.conf
that lets you select either your default or base kernel on bootup.
My lilo.conf is shown in <a href="3018l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>, minus some comment lines.</p><p>The important addition to lilo.conf is the last section
(<b  >#base&nbsp;kernel</b>) which tells LILO about your
new kernel. Also, be sure lilo.conf has <b  >prompt</b>
and <b  >timeout</b> lines. Now execute
<b  >lilo</b> and then reboot. LILO will pause, giving
the prompt <b  >boot:</b>. If you hit TAB, you will be
given the choices <b  >linux</b> and
<b  >base</b>. Enter <b  >base</b> and your new
kernel will boot. You may get complaining messages about bad module
dependencies, but if your base kernel is complete, that shouldn't
bother you. If something goes wrong, reboot and enter
<b  >linux</b> (or just wait through the timeout
interval) and your old kernel will boot. Make sure you have a
working base kernel before proceeding. With this approach, you
never burn your bridges (or kernel) behind you.</p><p>If you don't use LILO, make a boot floppy for your base
kernel. To do this, insert a floppy and execute
<b  >make&nbsp;zdisk</b>, instead of
<b  >zImage</b>.</p><p>You are now ready to compile a kernel with modules tailored
to your system. Execute the same commands as above, but when you
execute xconfig or menuconfig, pick some features to compile as
modules. I suggest you experiment first by picking nice-to-have,
but not-necessary, modules to add to zImage.base. Good choices
might be printer support or floppy support (unless you are booting
from the floppy). Save your configuration as kernelconf.mod in case
you need to go back. Also, write down which modules you are
compiling. To know exactly which modules are compiled, I suggest
you move or delete your old modules (if any). The Caldera release
includes a lot of modules. They are in /lib/modules/2.0.29. I moved
my old ones into subdirectories rather than deleting them, in case
I needed to back up. If you are working with a different release of
the kernel, instead of subdirectory 2.0.29 you will have a
subdirectory corresponding to your release number.</p><p>After executing <b  >make&nbsp;zImage</b>,
run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules; make modules_install
</pre><p>As before, go (using <span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span>) to
the directory containing zImage, rename it zImage.mod and move it
to the directory where LILO will look for it. Put a new section at
the bottom of lilo.conf to let you boot this kernel with the label
<b  >modules</b>. If you don't use LILO, make another
zDisk.
</p><p>Now, execute <b  >depmod -a</b>. This creates
/lib/modules/2.0.29/modules.dep, needed by module utilities. Next,
execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe -c | grep -v '^path' &gt; /etc/conf.modules
</pre><p>This command sets up another file needed by the module
utilities.
</p><p>Now reboot, choosing label <b  >modules</b> at the
boot prompt. Next, move to the /etc/modules/2.0.29 directory. It
should contain a file with a very long name like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#1 Tue Feb 11 20:36:48 MET 1997.default
</pre><p>This file is read at boot time by /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.
[Debian and Red Hat use /etc/modules&mdash;Ed.] It contains a list of
the default modules loaded when the kernel boots. You need to
change both the name and the contents. Fixing the name is the hard
part. In directory /etc/modules/2.0.29, execute the commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
FILE=`uname -v`.default
cp "#1 Tue"* "$FILE"
</pre>


This magic creates a file with the name that rc.modules will look
for on bootup. The name is based on the time the kernel was
compiled. If you recompile the kernel, you must repeat the magic.
</p><p>Edit this file to contain just the modules you want loaded at
bootup. For example, it might contain the lines</p><pre     class="programlisting">
floppy
lp
</pre><p>which would load the floppy and printer modules, assuming you
compiled them as modules. To get your editor to accept this file,
you may need to put quotes around the name.
</p><p>To load a module manually, execute <b  >insmod</b>
with your module name as argument. To remove it, execute
<b  >rmmod</b> with your module name as argument. To tell
which modules are currently loaded, execute
<b  >lsmod</b>.</p><p>The best toy is <span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span>; it
automatically loads and unloads modules as needed. Assume you have
compiled the floppy driver as a module. Check whether it is loaded
by executing <b  >lsmod</b>. If it is, remove it by
executing <b  >rmmod floppy</b>. Then execute
<b  >kerneld</b>. Now execute
<b  >mount&nbsp;/mnt/floppy</b> (or whatever mounts your
floppy). Magically, kerneld installs the floppy module when needed.
It will also uninstall modules which haven't been used for a while,
keeping your kernel lean and mean.</p><p>You now know enough to experiment with modules without
crashing your kernel on bootup. Read the Module mini-HOWTO, the
kerneld mini-HOWTO, and the man pages for the utilities to become a
real expert. Happy moduling!</p><p><a href="3018s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
