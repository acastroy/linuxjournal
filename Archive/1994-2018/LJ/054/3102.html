    Some background on the ISP and its switch to the Linux
    platform.

about the Internet service provider (ISP) Eskimo North
(http://www.eskimo.com/) converting totally to Linux. I decided it
was time to talk to Eskimo's owner, Robert Dinse, and find out
which rumors were true. We talked via e-mail on July 9. Eskimo is a
popular ISP based in Seattle, so Anne Tiemann went over and took
the pictures shown here.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I understand you
have just about completely moved to Linux on SunSPARC workstations.
Is this true? What were you using before?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: This is somewhat
incorrect. We have seven Suns running SunOS 4.1.4, six Suns running
SPARC Linux (Red Hat) and one PC running Linux.</p><p>In some areas Linux is clearly superior, and in some it still
has problems. In general, it works well with SunOS, so mixing
platforms isn't a problem and we use the OS best suited to any
particular task.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What factors entered
into your decision to switch to Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: With SunOS we are
locked into one hardware platform, SPARC. Basically, SunOS is no
longer being developed, and much new hardware is not supported by
SunOS.</p><p>Sun's replacement, Solaris, isn't particularly fast in my
experience, is buggy, bloated, and you can't do anything without
checking with a license manager first. The license fees are
ridiculous and the support from Sun has always left something to be
desired. There seems to be a new root exploit almost daily for
Solaris, and fixes from Sun are often far from
instantaneous.</p><p>So continuing down the Sun path using Sun's new operating
system was not a viable option for us. It's not cost-effective in
terms of either the actual cost of the software or efficient use of
hardware. Without source code, we are at the mercy of the vendor&mdash;a
situation I wanted to get away from.</p><p>Linux, on the other hand, was available for a multitude of
hardware platforms. Intel class CPUs are adequate for low-end
applications, and extremely inexpensive relative to SPARC CPUs. For
high-end applications, Alpha and Power-PC chips are beginning to
look attractive. Suns still have some architectural advantages that
may continue to make them the best hardware choice for
disk-I/O-intensive applications. The main advantage is the fact
that the peripherals are also mapped through the MMU (memory
management unit), so that disk I/O can be a direct memory access
(DMA) into user space instead of having to access kernel space and
then be copied by the CPU into user space, although with today's
faster CPUs, this is becoming a minor point. The point is,
whichever of these platforms is best for a particular application,
Linux gives us the freedom to use it. With SunOS, we can use Suns
or a SPARC clone but not Intel or Alpha or Power PC, and while
Solaris does support Intel, it's my feeling it is of marginal
functionality on any platform because of Sun's perceived need to
enforce arcane licensing policies with license managers.</p><p>Full source code is provided for Linux, so we are not at the
mercy of a vendor for fixes. If we have any questions about exactly
what the code is doing, we can just look at the source.</p><p>Linux is still being developed, which means that as things
like IPv6 become mainstream, it will remain viable where SunOS will
not. The software isn't straddled with having to wait for a license
manager to say it's okay for another user to log in or to use
another instance of a particular resource, because there is no
license manager. This, in my opinion, is a major problem with
Solaris.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What is the
principal use for your Linux machines?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: We have a Sun SS-10
with quad Ross RTK-625s and 256MB of RAM running SPARC Linux that
serves as our main web server, http://www.eskimo.com/.</p><p>We have these Sun LXs running SPARC Linux that serve as our
client IRC server irc.eskimo.com, our HUB IRC server
hub.eskimo.com, and our virtual domain web server www2.eskimo.com,
and one that serves as our FTP server ftp.eskimo.com and our adult
web server adult.eskimo.com. The IRC machines are equipped with
64MB of RAM, the other LXs are equipped with 96MB.</p><p>We have a Sun 4/670MP with dual Ross RTK-625 CPUs, 256MB of
RAM, and a second SCSI controller running SPARC Linux that serves
as our news server eskinews.eskimo.com. We actually have two more
CPUs for this machine, but a bug in SPARC Linux prevents it from
working with four CPUs on the 4/670MP platform.</p><p>We also have a Pentium-based PC running Linux that is one of
our mail servers, mx1.eskimo.com (external/list). Additionally,
name servers run on some of these machines.</p><p><a href="3102f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Stack
of Suns running Linux</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about your &ldquo;not
Linux&rdquo; machines?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Our main interactive
host, eskimo.com (where shell accounts and web pages are located),
is a Sun 4/670MP with quad Ross RTK-625 CPUs, 384MB of RAM and an
FDDI (fiber distribution data interface), so it sits directly on
the dual FDDI network backbone. In addition to interactive shell
accounts, it also provides all the user file space.</p><p>We have a Sun IPX with a Wytek Power-uP 80 MHz CPU and 128MB
of RAM that is used for SLIP and PPP emulation programs (tia and
slirp), tia1.eskimo.com; a Sun IPX with 64MB of RAM running as a
mail server (external/list), mx2.eskimo.com; a Sun 4/330 with 96MB
of RAM which runs IRC bots, chat.eskimo.com; a Sun 4/260 with 108MB
of RAM that runs a Moo, name server and empire game,
isumataq.eskimo.com; a Sun LX with 96MB of RAM and FDDI that is the
mail server hosting the spool directory, pop server and internal
SMTP server (the one customers connect to internally as opposed to
one that receives external mail); and an IPX with 64MB of RAM that
is used as a work station.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Will you be changing
these machines over too? If not, why?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Yes and No...
Eskimo, Tia1, Isumataq and Chat will remain SunOS until such time
as Linux is more predictable from a security standpoint, since they
have interactive users logging into them.</p><p>Mail and Eskimo will remain SunOS until FDDI support for the
FDDI cards we use is part of SPARC Linux, or until we find an
affordable solution to interface 100-base-T which is supported by
SPARC Linux to our dual FDDI backbone.</p><p>The mx2 mail server may be converted to SPARC Linux in the
not too distant future. Earlier versions had serious problems with
NIS, but those have been fixed in glibc, paving the way for the
switch.</p><p>Earlier versions of Linux also had problems with Sun4c
architecture, so the one IPX we are using as a workstation still
runs SunOS. We haven't had time to experiment with recent SPARC
kernels to see if that issue is adequately resolved.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you feel are
the main advantages for an ISP to use Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: The main advantage I
suspect is driving most ISPs is cost. It's hard to beat free, not
counting the cost of media and support offered by various
vendors.</p><p>We also found some technical advantages. SunOS libraries
support only 256 file descriptors per process. We needed more than
this for our web servers and IRC servers, so going to a different
OS wasn't an option for these machines. Mail servers run much more
efficiently with more file descriptors, because you can use a
larger open connection cache, and less thrashing (closing and
opening of descriptors) is necessary for operations such as list
processing.</p><p>For News, SunOS is limited to 2GB file partitions. This is
completely inadequate for news volumes today. While SunOS and
Solaris have something called &ldquo;Online Disksuite&rdquo; available, it is
at best a kludge to get around a fundamental problem with the OS.
Linux's support for huge stripped partitions made it attractive for
the news server.</p><p>Last, Sun hardware has not remained cost-competitive with
other platforms, and we wanted the freedom to migrate towards other
hardware platforms such as Alpha. Linux provided this
freedom.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about
disadvantages? Tell us about any problems you have had.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: NIS and NFS bugs.
NIS would fail randomly with the older libs, making it unusable for
applications where proper user lookups were essential, such as mail
servers that need to deliver mail, or web servers where a user's
directory has to be located. We worked around this on some
machines, where the file descriptor issue was important, by putting
together a kludge to place a local copy of the password file on the
Linux boxes that had broken NIS libraries. This solution is
inefficient. <span   class="bold"><b>glibc</b></span> fixes this
problem. However, on SPARC platforms no compatibility library is
provided, so all applications must be recompiled. This process is
going to make conversion a somewhat tedious project.</p><p>NFS works, as long as the servers are alive. But if the NFS
server goes away for some reason (is rebooted, for example), the
NFS client machines will not always recover without a reboot. This
isn't a complete showstopper, but it's very annoying.</p><p>While Linux supports a broader spectrum of hardware, it does
not support all of the SPARC hardware periphery supported by SunOS,
such as the FDDI cards or a 4/670MP configured with four
CPUs.</p><p>Then there are security issues. SunOS is fairly static at
this point, so most of the security problems are well known and
fixes are available. Linux is still in a constant state of flux,
resulting in new security holes being introduced&mdash;it's a moving
target. Between that and the fact that I have more experience with
SunOS, I feel more comfortable with SunOS where users are actually
able to log in to the box.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you feel is
needed to turn Linux into the number one OS choice for ISPs
everywhere?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I'm not sure it
isn't already. Most ISPs seem to use PC platforms, and cost is
important. A percentage of them just don't feel comfortable without
a vendor holding their hand, and in this area Linux is at a
disadvantage. There are also really strange people who want to see
Microsoft on the label and insist on running NT, even though they
might need ten times as many machines to do the same amount of
work. I do not understand the psychology of that group at all or
know what Linux could possibly do to appeal to them without ruining
Linux's functionality.</p><p>In terms of general improvements, glibc with its fix for NIS
and some security improvements is a big win. If someone would fix
NFS so it would properly recover after NFS server unavailability,
that would also be a major win. Of course, support for hardware
that we already have in use such as the S-bus FDDI cards and quad
CPU configurations of the 4/670MP would be a plus for us, but I
doubt it would be significant to ISPs in general, since Intel
hardware is a more common platform these days.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I understand you
have written software for a menu-driven user interface for ISPs.
Have you ported it to Linux? If not, do you plan to?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: The software I've
written is for Eskimo specifically. It is not something I intended
to sell as a software product, but rather intended as a feature of
Eskimo. Actually, at this point, it's pretty antiquated. I wrote it
before the Web existed, and in modern times, the multimedia
capabilities of the Web really provide an opportunity for a much
better interface. So I have no plans to port the old software to
Linux, though newer software I am now working on is web-based and
native to Linux (and probably not portable to other operating
systems because I am developing it for our own use, not for
resale).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell us a bit about
Eskimo&mdash;some history, customer base, etc.&mdash;blow your own
horn.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Eskimo North started
as a single-user BBS in 1982, and its initial creation was somewhat
accidental.</p><p>In my junior high and high school years, I was involved in
pirate radio (broadcasting without an FCC license). I had a number
of friends who were also involved and ran their own pirate radio
stations. Several of them were busted by the FCC, and one of them
was fined $750. I narrowly escaped fines after my own station
caused some interference in the 80-meter ham band and drew the
attention of the FCC. They sent me a cease and desist order, though
it was specific to the interference caused to 80 meters and said
absolutely nothing about the illegal broadcast in the AM broadcast
band. I had my first-class radio telephone license by this time and
didn't want to lose it, so that order ended my direct involvement
in pirate radio. However, I did experiment with various legal
alternatives such as carrier current and getting the absolute
maximum signal possible under the limitations of part 15 rules and
regulations for unlicensed transmitters.</p><p>One of my friends started a newsletter dealing with pirate
radio after he was fined, and since I couldn't be directly involved
safely anymore, I became interested in this. The way they were
putting it together was to type it up on an old Royal typewriter,
cut and paste it and make photocopies at a 7-11. I thought a
computer and printer might be a more efficient method and purchased
both, in part for that purpose but also because I was interested in
computers.</p><p>I hooked up a modem but there was no built-in support for the
serial port in the machine (Radio Shack model III); so I wrote what
was initially a primitive host program. At first, no login was
provided and the number wasn't advertised. People I wanted to allow
access to were given the number, and they could call with a modem,
invoke a word processor and do what they needed to do.</p><p>Even in 1982, people were running war dialers that found the
number and they started messing with the files, so I put up a
primitive BBS front-end. Its primary function was to keep people
out of files they didn't have permission to. I developed the host
program.</p><p>At that time, Glenn Gorman was running Minibin, an early
&ldquo;room-based&rdquo; BBS, written in BASIC. Glenn wanted to turn Minibin
into a commercial product, but it was written to use a host program
specific to the Microperipheral bus decoding modems. At the time, a
serial interface was not standard, and so Microperipherals
Corporation designed a modem that connected directly to the bus,
negating the need for a serial card, for around $300&mdash;this made it
a popular choice. But, Glenn couldn't sell Minibin using their
drivers because they were proprietary, and they designed their
modem so that the driver would work only with their modem. So he
approached me with the idea of using my host software with his BBS
software. However, my approach was much different than
Microperipherals, and getting my host program to work with Glenn's
BBS required fairly extensive modifications to both.</p><p>During that time, I ran a Minibin replacing the software I
was running. But, Minibin at the time did not have support for
private e-mail or file upload/download, both of which were things I
had in my software, so I added that functionality. Having two
Minibins caused no end of confusion; people didn't understand why
when they called one, their login didn't exist on the other. They
didn't understand that they were separate systems. A large number
of BBSs running the same software was not common then, like it is
today. So in an effort to clarify things, he named his BBS Minibin
South, and I named mine Minibin North. People were still confused,
so when he temporarily changed his to Jamaica South, I thought,
hmm, what's up north? Eskimos are up north, hence Eskimo
North.</p><p><a href="3102f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Modems!</b></span></a></p><p>During this time, I had also come across some quad density
double-sided 80-track drives and had a whole 3MB of disk space. I
know that's nothing today, but back then when I had only 48KB of
RAM and programs were typically quite small, 3MB was a lot!</p><p>By this time the BBS was well-known, and with the help of
some of my users who were true machine-code gurus (I could do okay
with the help of an assembler and disassembler), I had Infocom
adventures on-line and a bunch of other games. For its day, it was
fairly advanced. A book was published by an author in Alaska, and
in the book he said, &ldquo;Eskimo North ... a strange system. Must call
at least once even if it's long distance.&rdquo; With an endorsement
like that, the name stuck. By 1985, I could pull the plug at 4AM on
the modem, plug it back in, and immediately someone would
connect.</p><p>Just prior to that, I had obtained a trial account on
Compuserve, and I was impressed with all the cool things that could
be done in a multi-user environment, but at $15/hour for 300 baud
and $24/hour for 1200 baud, I could not afford it and I knew that
was true for many others as well. Some other friends I had met
through the BBS ran a network of four BBSs that were run on Apples
tied together with super-serial cards that permitted something
similar to MUDs, a multi-user D&amp;D kind of environment, but more
gruesome and more creative than any MUD I've seen since. The
hardware was always breaking down and was generally difficult to
maintain or scale.</p><p>I decided to go multi-user with Eskimo and started looking
for a workable platform. Networked Apples didn't look like the
answer. MPM looked capable, but I felt that the address space
limitations and hardware dependencies would limit its future
lifespan. Thus, I decided on UNIX; the only affordable UNIX system
I could get my hands on was a Tandy 16B with an ugly, primitive
version of Xenix. That was our entry into the UNIX world, initially
with four phone lines.</p><p>We took that machine as far as we could, basically upgrading
to a Tandy 6000 with 4MB of RAM, two 70MB disks and 11
lines.</p><p>In 1991, I bought a Sun 3/180, an ancient MC68020-based Sun
that absolutely ran circles around the Tandy, and we upgraded it to
a 3/280, then a 4/280, then we took news off the machine and put it
on a separate 4/330, and we've been growing and adding new hardware
and functions ever since. When the Internet became available,
around 1995, we added Internet connectivity, initially with a 14.4K
PPP link, then 28.8K, then a 56K frame relay, then a T1 frame
relay, then a dedicated T1 to Sprint, now with dual T1s to Sprint.
We also utilize a port wholesaler with T3 backbone for 56K dial-up
access.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you feel the
future holds for eskimo.com?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Well, there are two
aspects to the Internet as I see it: access, essentially the roads
that get you where you want to go; and hosting in all its forms,
essentially the land, the buildings, the space where things are
kept and where people meet and interact.</p><p>I will continue to provide access as long as there is a
demand for it and we can address that demand in a cost-effective
and efficient manner.</p><p>However, I am personally a lot more interested in the hosting
side of things: what can be done with the Web and helping people
create their own web space and make it available to the
masses.</p><p>I personally do not share the vision of the Web as being a
glorified infinite-channel cable company. I don't share the vision
that so many have of making the Web a place where a few people
control all the content and spoon-feed it to the masses. Rather, my
personal interest is in getting the masses involved in creating
content and sharing it and interacting with each other.</p><p>It's my view that for every problem facing mankind, there is
probably someone somewhere who has an answer. The Internet has the
potential for allowing those ideas to be heard, expressed and
implemented. Additionally, while some fear the sharing of cultures
will lead to a mono-culture, or essentially no culture, I believe
quite the opposite is true. I think people will hang on to their
own cultures, languages and traditions, and feel that the sharing
that results on the web will lead towards more tolerance and
understanding and an enrichment of all cultures. I want Eskimo to
be a part of that process. I've tried to encourage people by
providing good tools for web development and making disk space
available cheap. We also have no data export fees, so users are not
punished for creating a popular web site.</p><p>To this end, I've tried very hard to involve our customers in
what we do. We have some local newsgroups, the most important of
them being &ldquo;lobby&rdquo; which serves as a forum for our users to
discuss things relevant to our operation. I share plans and ideas
with our customers and solicit ideas from them.</p><p>Our customers have truly driven us to where we are today and
while I'd like to say to you I have solid plans to make Eskimo this
and that in five years, the truth is I intend to allow them to
continue to determine our direction.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Anything else you'd
like to tell us about?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: While we've had
customers from all over the world for some time utilizing host
features here, until recently we've had dial access available only
in Western Washington. We now have 56KB available in many
metropolitan areas in the U.S. including shell access, web hosting,
etc. I'm not sure how this is going to affect Eskimo's future, but
I am going to try very hard to make it a place that people will
think of as a home in cyberspace. Phone numbers for reaching us are
206-361-1161 and 800-246-6874.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thank you very
much.</p></div></div>
