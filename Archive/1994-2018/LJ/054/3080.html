computer cognoscenti&mdash;those who make software and run networks.
However, it has proved less successful among ordinary computer
users&mdash;those who buy software and pay for networks. Whenever I
describe Linux to ordinary users, I inevitably receive two
reactions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>They are delighted to hear there is another
operating system available for their PC, particularly one as
powerful and as inexpensive as Linux.</p></li><li><p>They wonder what they &ldquo;can do&rdquo; with Linux. In
particular, they wonder which Microsoft Office applications they
can run under Linux. When I answer &ldquo;None,&rdquo; the light fades from
their eyes as their interest dies.</p></li></ol></div><p>As much as Linux enthusiasts may deplore this attitude, it is
certainly natural. Ordinary users, after all, care little about the
technical features of an operating system, and even less about the
politics of it. What matters to them is whether they'll be able to
use the computer to do their work; and whether we like it or not,
the Microsoft Office suite of applications has been established in
most workplaces as the standard suite of tools by which work gets
done.</p><p>Fortunately, two packages will let me change my &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a
tentative &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Applixware and StarOffice are two robust,
integrated office packages that offer reasonable compatibility with
the Microsoft Office suite of tools.</p><p>In this review, I'll discuss and give my impressions of each
package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x124c268"></a>Applixware</h2></div></div><p>Applixware is manufactured by Applix, Inc., of Westboro,
Massachusetts. I used release 4.3, in the version designed for use
with Red Hat Linux 5.0. The package comes with the base release of
Red Hat 5.0; however, all executables are statically linked and
should work with any release of Linux using kernel 2.0 or
higher.</p><p>Applixware includes the following modules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Applix Words, a word processor</p></li><li><p>Applix HTML Author</p></li><li><p>Applix Graphics, a tool for creating and editing
graphical presentations (slide shows and the like)</p></li><li><p>Applix Spreadsheets</p></li><li><p>Applix OpenMail, a mailer</p></li><li><p>Applix Presents, a tool for creating slide
presentations</p></li><li><p>Filter packs to convert data from and into a
variety of popular formats</p></li></ul></div><p>The utilities use a common object format, so that objects
built with one tool can be integrated into another. For example, a
spreadsheet built with Applix Spreadsheets can be integrated into
an Applix Words document, or sent as a mail message via Applix
OpenMail.</p><p>An optional utility, Applix Builder, gives a user lower-level
access to the objects built with any of the utilities. The user can
integrate these objects with custom code to construct new
customized applications.</p><p>Finally, the package comes with a printed manual that
introduces Applixware and gives the basics of how to work with the
package as a whole.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x124c9f8"></a>StarOffice</h2></div></div><p>StarOffice is an office package that is manufactured by Star
Division GmbH, of Hamburg, Germany. I used release 3.4, in the
version bundled with Caldera's OpenLinux. This edition of
StarOffice is usable on most Linux systems with kernel 2.0 or later
and libc 5.4.4 or later.</p><p>StarOffice includes the following modules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>StarCalc (<span   class="bold"><b>scalc3</b></span>),
a spreadsheet</p></li><li><p>StarChart
(<span   class="bold"><b>schart3</b></span>), a program for creating
charts and graphs</p></li><li><p>StarDraw (<span   class="bold"><b>sdraw3</b></span>),
a tool for assembling slides and presentations</p></li><li><p>StarImage
(<span   class="bold"><b>simage3</b></span>), a tool for working with
images</p></li><li><p>StarMath (<span   class="bold"><b>smath3</b></span>),
a mathematics tool</p></li><li><p>StarWriter
(<span   class="bold"><b>swriter3</b></span>), a word
processor</p></li></ul></div><p>Also included are two daemons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>svdaemon</b></span> manages
on-line help</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>svportmap</b></span> manages
communication among the modules</p></li></ul></div><p>StarOffice does not come with a printed manual, at least in
the edition I tested. Given that Star Division GmbH is a German
company, the native language of the package is German; as a result,
the documentation and notes are worded a bit oddly at times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1243d88"></a>Applixware Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation of Applixware requires the user to log in as the
superuser. Installation for Applixware is managed by
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>, the Red Hat Package Manager,
a copy of which is included on the Applixware CD-ROM. A shell
script invokes <span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>, queries the
user via a crude graphical interface for options (e.g., the
directory into which the package should be installed and alternate
languages for documentation), then installs the selected Applixware
features. The default installation, including optional clip art and
English-language documentation, consumes about 112MB of disk
space.</p><p>Applixware's various applications work through a single
master program, called <span   class="bold"><b>applix</b></span>.
Applixware creates a symbolic link to
<span   class="bold"><b>applix</b></span> in /bin at installation.
Because <span   class="bold"><b>applix</b></span> manages access to
shared libraries and other utilities, a user does not need to
modify her environment to use Applixware.</p><p>The license for this version of Applixware limits it to a
single user.</p><p>In brief, installation is simple and straightforward.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1244150"></a>StarOffice Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation of StarOffice requires the user to log in as the
superuser, then use <span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> to install
packages of executables. A copy of
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> is included with the release,
in case your release of Linux does not include it. Unlike
Applixware, in which installation is managed by a shell script, you
must invoke <span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> by hand for each
part of StarOffice you wish to install.</p><p>Installation goes quite smoothly. The default installation,
including English-language documentation, consumes about 75MB of
disk space.</p><p>The license for StarOffice allows the package to be used by
only one user. That user must run a set-up program to configure the
package for her. She must then add a script to her account's
profile to set the environment properly for StarOffice.</p><p>Installation and setup are relatively simple. Unfortunately,
the need to patch the user's environment is not documented. A naive
user will find StarOffice does not work after setup and will have
no way to figure out how to fix the problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1244468"></a>Test Environment</h2></div></div><p>I tested both packages on a home-brew PC built around a
100-MHz i80486 DX4 processor. The machine has 16 megabytes of RAM
and a 2.2-GB SCSI disk plugged into an Adaptec 1542 controller. The
machine runs Slackware release 3.2, which uses kernel 2.0.19 and
libc release 5.4.17.</p><p>Both packages require a lot of horsepower. The test system
was able to run both reasonably well. However, running either
package on a 486 is not something I would recommend if you are at
all impatient.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x12445c8"></a>Criteria for Testing</h2></div></div><p>To exhaustively test each module in two complex packages is
impossible in a reasonable period of time. I decided, therefore, to
concentrate on the following criteria for each package:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Functionality:</em></span> Does each
module provide at least the minimum needed to perform a given
task?</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Communication:</em></span> Do the modules
work well with each other?</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Portability:</em></span> Do the modules
import and export files correctly? I was particularly interested in
their ability to import and export files to Microsoft
Office.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Robustness:</em></span> Could I find any
obvious bugs?</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Aesthetics:</em></span> Which package's
&ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; did I prefer? This is, of course, a subjective
judgment.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1244c50"></a>Applixware Results</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, Applixware works through a single
master application, which invokes all of the other
applications.</p><p>First, here are my global impressions. A user who is familiar
with Microsoft Office will find herself at home in Applixware. The
biggest difference is that toolbars and buttons cannot be
rearranged dynamically&mdash;what you see is what you get. Likewise, it
does not come with as rich a set of fonts and templates as Office.
The contents and ordering of menus, including right-button menus,
closely resemble their Microsoft analogues.</p><p>A few minor differences exist. For example, you must click a
menu's button before the menu drops down, rather than just sweeping
the mouse pointer over the button. I, for one, find this to be an
improvement rather than a problem; you may disagree.</p><p>As with the Microsoft Office applications, each object
manipulated by Applixware is linked with the utility that generated
it. For example, if you drag clip art into an Applix Words document
and then double-click over it, Applix invokes Applix Graphics,
which displays the graphic and allows you to edit it.</p><p>Finally, Applix comes with a nicely written set of
documentation, including context-sensitive help screens.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix Words</b></span> is a
full-featured word processor. Figure 1 shows the Applix Words
screen with some text dropped into the document. (Images in this
article were made using
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>.)</p><p><a href="3080f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Applix Words Screen</b></span></a></p><p>My preliminary test showed it to be robust. I found I could
export documents to Microsoft Word and import documents from it
without error. Unlike Microsoft Word, the user must click the
<span   class="bold"><b>Import</b></span> button and give the
document's type, rather than clicking the
<span   class="bold"><b>Open</b></span> button and depending upon the
application to sense the file's type; however, I found this to be
only a minor difficulty.</p><p>An anecdote may illustrate the application's robustness:
while I was working on this review, I was also doing the index for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network</em></span>. The publisher insisted on
receiving it in Microsoft Word 6.0 format. I prepared a raw form of
the index in text under Linux using Emacs, because Emacs is a much
more powerful editor than any available in a GUI environment. My
intention was to convert the file to Word format just before I
shipped it. However, the weekend before I was to deliver the index,
the hard disk on my Windows 95 machine died. I did not have time to
install a new disk and reconfigure it. In desperation, I used
Applix Word to convert the index to Word format and shipped it to
the publisher; the file was accepted without a murmur.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix HTML Author</b></span> is a
simple, straightforward tool for preparing web pages. I found it
useful for editing existing web pages, less so when preparing a web
page <span   class="emphasis"><em>de novo</em></span>. One drawback is that HTML data
types are presented in the menu by name rather than through
descriptive text.</p><p>On the whole, a user who is not already familiar with HTML
will not find this tool especially helpful.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix Graphics</b></span> is a tool
for drawing and assembling graphics. Anyone who has used similar
tools, such as Frame, Microsoft Word or
<span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span>, will find its features and
interface familiar.</p><p>Applix Graphics serves as the graphics &ldquo;lightboard&rdquo; for
Applix Presents (described below) and other Applix applications.
Created images can be exported to most common graphical formats and
can be pasted into other Applix documents. In this, Applixware has
a definite advantage over Microsoft Office. Office's applications
each have their own graphics engine, and the output of each is by
no means totally compatible with the other Office applications. (As
I found once when I tried to export a PowerPoint graphic to Word
6.0, only to find that all gray-scale elements had
vanished.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix Spreadsheets</b></span> is a
spreadsheet with the usual features. I am no spreadsheet maven, so
I will pass over it by saying that it appears to do what one would
expect from a spreadsheet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix Presents</b></span>: This tool
lets the user build graphical presentations such as slide shows,
sets of overhead displays or handouts. It is analogous to Microsoft
PowerPoint. As I mentioned earlier, this tool uses Applix Graphics
as its &ldquo;lightboard&rdquo;, so if you've become familiar with that tool,
you should not have much trouble mastering Presents.</p><p>This tool comes with a nicely designed set of
templates.</p><p>Users who are used to PowerPoint will find this tool departs
from the Microsoft &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; somewhat more than the other
Applix utilities. However, most of the useful PowerPoint features
are present, including outline format, notes format and the ability
to print in a variety of single-slide and multi-slide
arrangements.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Applix Mail</b></span> is a mailer
which contains the usual features, such as those found with
Netscape Communicator or similar GUI mailers. One nice feature not
seen in Netscape Communicator mailers is that messages with
attached files built by Microsoft applications can be exported
immediately to the appropriate Applix utility and viewed. You don't
have to save it to a file, then export it to a Windows box before
you can view it. Not every Microsoft format is recognized; in
particular, a filter for Word 7.0 is not included with the package
reviewed. However, I nonetheless found it to be quite
useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1557ad0"></a>StarOffice Results</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned earlier, I found StarOffice more difficult to
install than Applixware, although an experienced Linux user should
not find installation of either package particularly
difficult.</p><p>Unlike Applixware, in which each application is invoked
through a master control-panel utility, StarOffice consists of
individually invoked applications that communicate via a special
daemon. Unfortunately, I could not get either the inter-application
daemon or the help daemon to work under Slackware. In all
likelihood, this was due to my system's lacking some special
configuration; still, without the help daemon working, I had no way
to read the documentation to discover the cause of my
problem.</p><p>First, here are my global impressions. The StarOffice package
is quite sophisticated. Its look-and-feel is slicker than that of
Applixware&mdash;clearly some very talented designers and programmers
paid a great deal of attention to the details of this package.
While its interface will be easily used by someone who has worked
with the Microsoft Office tools, it is, in my opinion, more
flexible and easier to use than its Microsoft counterpart. There's
something very German about StarOffice, in the same way there's
something very German about a Mercedes or a BMW&mdash;a combination of
impeccable engineering and a design that is solid, rich and
intelligent.</p><p>As with the Microsoft tools and unlike Applixware, StarOffice
implements each element of the interface as a separate object. This
lets the user assemble and arrange the elements of the interface to
best suit her preferences.</p><p>This look and feel does come at a price, however; StarOffice
runs considerably slower on trailing-edge hardware, such as the
system I used for testing, than Applixware does. This is serious
software that requires serious hardware. The subtlety of the
interface, too, requires at least a 17-inch monitor to be used to
its best advantage.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarCalc</b></span> is the spreadsheet
application included with StarOffice. As I mentioned earlier, I
seldom use spreadsheets; however, as best I can tell, StarCalc
offers the features that one would expect from a well-designed
spreadsheet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarChart</b></span> builds charts and
graphs. The user can either enter data by hand or use files built
with any of a variety of word processors, text processors or
spreadsheets. StarOffice allows the user to build the standard
variety of charts: pie, bar, line, scatter or area. Images or
graphics in any of a variety of formats can be pasted in. Graphs
can be exported to other StarOffice applications, or to a variety
of other tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarDraw</b></span> is a tool for
assembling images. With StarDraw, you can assemble images and
graphics plus text into presentations of one or more slides. This
is the StarOffice analogue to Microsoft PowerPoint.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarImage</b></span> is a tool for
working with images. It comes with the usual features for
assembling and manipulating images. However, I don't think it is a
tool that will make anyone forget
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarMath</b></span> is a tool that
enables building and testing of mathematical formulas. You can
import formulas from other tools, use a point-and-click interface
to select from a rich set of mathematical elements in order to
modify a formula, and export the results to a variety of other
tools, including StarCalc.</p><p><a href="3080f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
StarWriter's Main Window</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>StarWriter</b></span> is a
full-featured word processor. Figure 2 shows StarWriter's main
window. The StarWriter interface will be familiar to those who have
worked with Microsoft Word. Folded into StarWriter are a number of
features usually seen in separate tools, in particular tools for
displaying and building documents in HTML. What a novel idea: a
tool for working with documents should work intelligently with a
variety of documents, regardless of format.</p><p>I should state here that I have spent thousands of hours
working with text processors, starting with
<span   class="bold"><b>troff</b></span> and working through Word,
Frame and other WYSIWYG tools. Over that time I've become rather
jaded; I've found that slickness in a tool usually impedes my work
rather than helps it. But this jaded user quickly fell in love with
StarWriter; it is now my word processor of choice. Now, if I could
just convince the boss to let me use it at work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1153580.0x1558368"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I was delighted with both packages. I found them both to be
good, robust office tools. I warmly recommend both Applixware and
StarOffice to users who need to run office applications under
Linux.</p><p>Which package you choose will depend on a number of
factors:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Applixware's installation is easier than
StarOffice's. Applixware does not require a user to modify her
environment before using the package.</p></li><li><p>Applixware runs more briskly than StarOffice, at
least on the trailing-edge hardware I used.</p></li><li><p>The edition of Applixware I reviewed includes a
printed introductory manual, which I found helpful. StarOffice
requires users to gain access to the on-line documentation, and
doing so is by no means easy.</p></li><li><p>StarOffice's interface more closely resembles
Microsoft Office than does Applixware's. StarOffice's buttons,
switches and menus will appear familiar to users who have worked
with Microsoft Office.</p></li><li><p>StarOffice's interface is configurable: buttons can
be added to the toolbars, removed from them or repositioned.
Applixware has a static interface: what you see is what you get and
that's it.</p></li><li><p>Each package offers some applications not included
with the other. For example, Applixware includes an HTML-builder,
whereas StarOffice includes a mathematics package.</p></li></ul></div><p>These differences notwithstanding, each package offers
excellent value for your money, especially compared to its
Microsoft counterpart.</p><p>If you are considering an office package for Linux, I
strongly suggest that you try out both packages and select the one
that best suits your needs and tastes.</p><p>In my opinion, both Applixware and StarOffice offer the
ordinary computer user a reasonable alternative to Microsoft
Office, and offer other features as well&mdash;not to mention giving the
user access to the power of Linux.</p></div></div>
