correctly. This is because the KDE API has changed since the time
my article &ldquo;A First Look at KDE Programming&rdquo; (August, 1998) and
program were written. An updated version of the khello source code
can now be found at http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/KHello and

As I
began to look for notebooks which support Linux, I found a site
that sells UNIX Server notebooks at http://www.tadpole.com/. They
have both SPARC and Alpha notebooks. I was quite impressed. A
SPARC20 model of the notebook supports Linux as well as an Alpha
version.</p><p>Anyway, I thought your readers might like to know about this
site. Maybe one day we will see a review of these notebooks in
<i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Binzr binz@swconnect.net</p><p>If you get one, maybe you could do the review.

response.</p><p>He accuses Red Hat of delivering a &ldquo;truly bad release&rdquo; and,
as evidence, draws our attention to the errata list that includes
listings of bugs for which no fix is yet available. Surely openness
about what's fixed and what's not is at the heart of the Open
Source movement. To go on and claim that Red Hat is behaving in a
very Microsoft-like way defies both logic and the day-to-day
experiences of system administrators around the world.</p><p>One could claim that Red Hat does not write the software
containing these bugs, they merely package it, but in truth they do
far more than that. Red Hat does a good job in maintaining their
distribution and keeping it current. Their pioneering work with
glibc (alongside the Debian project) is just one example of a
benefit to the wider Linux community. If Mr. Maurice doesn't want
to download a whole RPM file, he is welcome to download the source
of any package and track patches from its maintainer. Nothing in
the Red Hat distribution forces him to use RPMs&mdash;most users find
them extremely convenient.</p><p>&mdash;Grant McLean sisl@ihug.co.nz</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257e8c8"></a>July 1998 Issue</h2></div></div><p>I just finished reading the July issue, and I must say that
it will most likely go on the shelf, never to be read by me again.
I found no useful article in the entire issue. Don't get me wrong,
I am all for Linux success stories, but most of the articles were
so technically dry that I lost interest after a paragraph. I have
been a subscriber since January 1998, and this is the first issue
to achieve the title of &ldquo;useless&rdquo;. That being said, I love
<i  >LJ</i> and wish to see the ongoing improvement of
both Linux and <i  >LJ</i>. Thank you for hearing my
whine.</p><p>&mdash;Griffin Caprio griffinc@ameritech.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257ead8"></a>NIS Comments</h2></div></div><p>I have a couple of comments on an article in the June 1998
issue: &ldquo;Introducing the Network Information Service for Linux&rdquo; by
Preston Brown.</p><p>At the time of writing (February 1998), the latest version of
Red Hat was 5.0, not 4.2, so the remark about an older version of
ypserv in 4.2 has no value. What I do find a little odd is that 5.0
(released December '97) shipped the same version of ypserv,
considering 1.2.5 had been out since mid-October. Currently,
though, Red Hat 5.1 ships 1.3.1, which was (presumably, considering
we now have 1.3.2) the latest one when they closed the distribution
(June 1998).</p><p>The /contrib/hurricane directory contains software for Red
Hat 5.0 (code name Hurricane, a glibc-based distribution) that
can't be used (except in a few trivial cases) on libc5-based
systems, such as Red Hat 4.2.</p><p>I'd like to know which features I missed by not having
ypbind, but the article doesn't give this information; I can only
say that all my programs worked flawlessly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>domainname</b></span> was not invoked
in Red Hat 4.2, but is present in Red Hat 5.0 (see the comment
above on release dates).</p><p>&mdash;Andrea Borgia bab0069@iperbole.bologna.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257edf0"></a>Comments on July</h2></div></div><p>As a new convert to Linux, I am very satisfied with my
subscription to <i  >LJ</i>. I have comments about two
of the articles in the July issue, one positive, the other less
so.</p><p>Thank you for the avalanche predictor model by Richard
Sevenich and Rick Price. It reminded me&mdash;at an optimal time&mdash;of the
power and utility of fuzzy logic to many of the real-world problems
we deal with on each project. I've applied fuzzy logic to a GIS
(Geographic Information System) for land use decision making
support. But, in the press of too many things to do and not enough
time, I had forgotten about this powerful set of tools. Thanks to
this article, I have a solution to at least one environmental
problem which affects the mining industry. Since we use Linux, the
model will be developed and run on this platform. If there's
demand, we'll make it available on Windows 95, too, using Tcl/Tk
for the user interface.</p><p>On a less positive note, I need to ask why Richard Parry's
article on position reporting using GPS and ham radio was
published. After reading the article, I still have the unanswered
question, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</p><p>We use GPS data extensively in our field work. We use it to
delineate wetlands, orthorectify aerial photos, measure mines and
quarries for modeling of storm water runoff and reclamation
planning, locate wildlife nests/burrows and other phenomena of the
world out of doors. We also know that many surface mines use GPS
technology to dispatch haul trucks and maximize operations, many
police and fire vehicles are equipped with GPS/GIS systems for
emergency response, and at least one long-haul trucking company
(Schneider, with the orange tractors and trailers) uses the
technology to increase their efficiency, customer service and
driver satisfaction. Given all this, what is the value of having
one's vehicle location transmitted to a network of amateur radio
stations? I was a licensed ham operator (many, many moons ago), so
I'm certainly not belittling them.</p><p>What I'm saying is that this article appears to be more of a
reporting on, &ldquo;we know how to do this, so we will,&rdquo; than a
solution to a real problem. If I've missed something in the
article, please do let me know. Each of the other five articles
related to the issue theme report how Linux facilitates solving a
problem. This one article doesn't appear&mdash;to me&mdash;to fit that
mold.</p><p>Regardless, kudos are due to all of you for a very useful
information source (including the ads). I'll be buying a SCSI
adapter from one of your advertisers tomorrow, since my relatively
new (but shortly out of warranty) HP/CMS tape drive has decided to
die.</p><p>&mdash;Dr. Richard B. Shepard rshepard@appl-ecosys.com</p><p>I thought Mr. Parry's article was fun; not every article
needs to address a &ldquo;real&rdquo; problem. If I had a GPS article
describing some of the ways it's used that you mention, I'd have
been happy to publish it too &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257f1b8"></a>July BTS</h2></div></div><p>In the &ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo; column in the July
issue, Mark Bishop responded to a question titled &ldquo;Editing motd
and issue&rdquo;. Mr. Bishop forgot to point out that the Slackware
distribution, by default on startup, overwrites the /etc/motd and
/etc/issue files. To change this, one must comment out (#) the
commands that overwrite the /etc/motd and /etc/issue files. Check
out the /etc/rd.d/rc.local (I think) file in Slackware to make the
changes. After doing so, you can edit the /etc/motd and /etc/issue
files without fear of them being overwritten.</p><p>&mdash;Andrew Dvorak andrew_dvorak@IName.com</p><p>You have contacted me about the Slackware distribution
overwriting on bootup. Not all distributions do this, however, and
I believe that hasn't always been the default behavior of
Slackware. I wish I had the time to keep up with all the
distributions, and I plan on installing Slackware on my new machine
now that a new version has been released (too bad it's not based on
libc6). Thank you for pointing out that not all distributions are
created equal.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Bishop mark@bish.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257f3c8"></a>Removing Files and Security</h2></div></div><p>I am writing in response to Dave Lutz's (dlutz@smith.edu)
letter on removing files and security. In it he discusses security
issues presented by IRC and lynx, along with &ldquo;hacker
flags&rdquo;.</p><p>He discusses how IRC is a security risk. IRC has been around
for many years, and is the main form of chat used by people on the
Internet. The act of being on IRC does not become a security risk.
He cites the trading of &ldquo;warez&rdquo; and pirated software as an
example. Web pages and other forms of chat are used to spread
those, and they are not security risks. He also mentions the
&ldquo;eggbot&rdquo;. The proper name of this is &ldquo;Eggdrop&rdquo;, and as one of
the developers of this program, I can assure you that, if properly
configured, the bot poses no security threat.</p><p>His letter also mentions how lynx can be used to bring in
malicious files. Any program that can transfer files, be it ftp,
mail, lynx or IRC, can be used to bring in files. Disabling them is
not the proper way to secure a system, as this only hides the
problem&mdash;it does not solve it. Several key issues should be looked
into when securing a system.</p><p>One of the main issues would be setuid root programs, that
is, programs which run under root permissions. Several
distributions, especially older ones, come with setuid root
programs which can be used to gain root access on the system. These
include SuperProbe, xterm and others. The command
<b  >find&nbsp;/&nbsp;--perm&nbsp;+4000</b> can be used
to list setuid root programs. If a program doesn't have a specific
need to be root (try
<b  >chmod&nbsp;a-s&nbsp;<i><tt>program</tt></i></b>
and run it as a normal user), you should probably remove the setuid
bit to be safe.</p><p>Several security lists are available which detail security
problems as they are found, one of the main ones being Bugtraq. To
subscribe, send mail to listserv@netspace.org with &ldquo;subscribe
bugtraq&rdquo; as the subject.</p><p>Once again, security through obscurity can work for only so
long. If the person wants into your system, the methods described
by Dave will not prevent them from getting in.</p><p>&mdash;Jason Slagle jslagle@toledolink.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2486580.0x257f7e8"></a>Errors in July Article</h2></div></div><p>There is an error in your July article entitled &ldquo;Encrypted
File Systems&rdquo; by Bear Giles. On page 67, in the first column the
following commands appear:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -text2,loop,encryption=idea

That's it. You people do a great job. Keep it up.
