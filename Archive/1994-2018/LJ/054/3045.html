    Mr. Lane has written a program called picprg to enable you
    to easily program a PIC microcontroller.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dec3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The vast majority of the computers in the
world do not run Windows. While this is good news for Linux
enthusiasts, the bad news is that they don't run Linux or much of
any kind of operating system at all. These are the computers
running your televisions, VCRs, cell phones, pagers and marine
radios. They go by cryptic names like MC68HC05, 87C51, or PIC16C84
and are manufactured by companies like Motorola, Philips and
Microchip.
</p><p>Microcontrollers are the workhorse computers of the world.
They do the repetitive tasks that require little or no human
intervention and most of them will not even blink when the
&ldquo;millennium&rdquo; bug hits their larger, faster cousins. They power
up, do their job and power down again using very little power and
defiantly not requiring a heat sink and a fan.</p><p>One of these little wonders is the PIC16C84 from Microchip.
This is an 18-pin processor with 1KB of electrically
erasable/programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), 36 bytes of SRAM
and 13 input/output lines; it can operate at speeds ranging from DC
(0Hz) to 10MHz.</p><p>The PIC16C84 is an excellent introduction to embedded
processors and assembly language. The RISC instruction set has only
35 commands (op-codes) to learn, and the cost is under $8 for one.
You can build a PIC programmer for under $20 in parts, or you can
buy one pre-built and pre-tested over the Internet. Prototype
boards are also available that need only a processor; they already
have the clock crystal and programmer header, as well as a small
prototyping area for adding to the circuits (usually a couple of
LEDs for your first project).</p><p>This low cost for development doesn't mean that the PIC
cannot be used for serious work. Several of my projects include an
interface between the PC and the Dallas Semiconductor 1-wire bus,
and a wired remote control that uses the Sony Control-L protocol to
control a camcorder. In the most recent Circuit Cellar Ink contest,
one of the winners implemented the PPP and TFTP protocol using an
8-pin PIC12C672.</p><p>Because of the ease of designing and building a PIC
programmer to attach to a parallel port, dozens of designs are
available, all using different pins on the parallel port. Some use
inverters on all the control lines, and others use inverters on
only some of the lines. My program
<span   class="bold"><b>picprg</b></span> can handle all of these, as
long as they use the standard five control lines. With all of these
variations, the software to drive the programmer needs to be easily
configurable.</p><p>Another feature of these devices is the ability to design a
programming header into the circuit so that the processor can be
programmed without removing it from the device it is attached to.
This facilitates software work in the field, allowing technicians
to easily service and upgrade the software.</p><p>When I first started using the PIC16C84, a compiler was
already available for Linux, but no Linux software ran the HOPCO
programmer that I use. An easy way to solve this problem would have
been to get the DOS software included with the programmer to run
under DOSEMU. Since I never seem to pick the easy way, I decided to
write a native Linux PIC programmer. I decided on a full-screen
ncurses interface, which would run on a VT console or an xterm as
long as the <b  >TERM</b> environment variable is set to
<b  >xterm-color</b>.</p><p>My picprg program allows you to program the PIC
microcontroller, read previously programmed PICs, verify a PIC
against the program in memory, and view the program in hexadecimal.
It also features a versatile configuration screen, which makes it a
snap to use with the wide variety of PIC programmers
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dec8c8"></a>Compiling picprg</h2></div></div><p>Compiling picprg is easy: you just type
<b  >make</b> in the source directory and a binary called
picprg is generated. The only dependency for picprg that may cause
problems is the ncurses library. You must have v1.9.9e or later
installed for it to work. All of the Linux distributions that I
know of include ncurses by default, so you should be set. If you
want to install it as suid root in /usr/local/bin, then type
<b  >make install</b>; otherwise, you will have to move
it to your preferred final location.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>picprg</b></span> must be run as root,
since it requires low-level access to the /dev/lp device that isn't
available to normal users, even with write access enabled. You can
either run it as root or install it as suid root, so that it can
run as the root user. Remember that any program running suid root
is a potential security risk.</p><p>The first time picprg is started, you must pass it the number
of the printer port (/dev/lpX) to which you have attached the
programmer. I have my modified HOPCO programmer attached to
/dev/lp2, so I run <b  >picprg -p2</b> to start it for
the first time. You will see a nice blue screen (I'm still addicted
to the color scheme of my Atari 800) as shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3045f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. picprg Start-up Screen
</p></div></div><p>The main menu is self-explanatory. Pick option
<span   class="bold"><b>C</b></span> to get the configuration menu.
Use the arrow keys to navigate the list of configuration options,
and a short help message will be displayed for each
selection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dece48"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>I am using a programmer from HOPCO that has been re-wired to
use the same parallel port connections as a David Tait-style PIC
programmer. The connections for my programmer are as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Vpp control       pin 5  inverted logic
Vdd control       pin 4  inverted logic
Clock             pin 3  normal   logic
Data to PIC       pin 2  normal   logic
Data from PIC     pin 10 normal   logic
</pre><p>The connections for your programmer will most likely be
different, depending on the pins it uses to connect to the parallel
port and the transistor logic used to implement the on/off control.
The configuration menu (see Figure 2) allows you to easily specify
which pins are being used and the on/off logic used to control
them. Press <b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b> to switch
the logic used for control of each pin.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3045f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Configuration Menu
</p></div></div>

</p><p>After you have entered the correct pin number for each
function, test it to ensure that the PIC being programmed is seeing
the correct logic level. The configuration menu is used for this,
too. When one of the control lines is selected using the arrow
keys, the <b  >O</b> and <b  >F</b> keys can be
used to turn that control line On and Off. This on and off state is
defined from the perspective of picprg, taking into account the
polarity you specified when setting up the pins.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1ded370"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>Now, get out your trusty voltmeter or whatever you are going
to use for detecting power (it should be able to handle at least
13V). Connect the meter's GND to pin 5 on the programming socket.
Then select Vpp in the configuration menu and hit
<b  >O</b> and <b  >F</b> to turn it on and
off. You should see pin 4 going from 0V to 13V or so (depends on
the programmer). Repeat this for each of the pins listed
below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Vpp      pin 4   0 and approximately 12 volts
Vdd      pin 14  0 and 5 volts
Clock    pin 12  0 and 5 volts
Data Out pin 13  0 and 5 volts
</pre><p>The state of the <b  >Data In</b> pin on the
configuration display should be the same as the state of the
<b  >Data Out</b> pin. When <b  >Data Out</b>
is 1, the <b  >Data In</b> line should be 1 as well.
</p><p>Once you have all the voltages swinging the right direction,
press <b  >S</b> to save the configuration to
~/.picprgrc; type <b  >picprg</b>. You are now ready to
start using your PIC programmer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1ded840"></a>ID and FUSE Configuration</h2></div></div><p>When reading the object file, the ID and FUSE data are taken
from the memory locations specified in the configuration menu.
Microchip defines this to be <b  >0x2000</b>, but some
assemblers place this data in different locations. The
configuration menu allows you to specify where in the loaded file
the ID and FUSE data will be found. If you are using the
<span   class="bold"><b>picasm</b></span> assembler, the default
values for ID, FUSE and EEPROM location do not need to be changed.
They will work correctly right out of the box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1ded9f8"></a>EEPROM Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The PIC16C84 has 64 bytes of internal EEPROM data that can be
programmed with data like a unique serial number or configuration
parameters. This data can be included in the loaded file at the
memory location specified by the configuration menu. This address
is usually set to <b  >0x2100</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dedb58"></a>Supported File Types</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>picprg</b></span> uses the Intel HEX 16
format, which is supported by most assemblers. (I recommend picasm
by Timo Rossi.) The FUSE and EEPROM locations can be defined in the
configuration menu if your assembler does not put them in the
standard locations. <span   class="bold"><b>picasm</b></span> also
supports the Intel HEX 8 format, and picprg detects this file
format automatically. Just type in the file name, and the program
will figure out in which format the file was saved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e5f60"></a>Loading an Object File</h2></div></div><p>When an object file is loaded, it is stored in the internal
memory buffer. The clock type and fuse states are displayed on the
second line of the display while the file is in memory. The clock
type and fuse states are determined by looking at the data stored
in the FUSE memory location as defined in the configuration
menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e6068"></a>Reading a PIC</h2></div></div><p>Make sure the programmer is connected and the processor is
plugged in correctly. Press the <b  >R</b> key from the
main menu and the data from the processor will be read into the
internal buffer; its clock type and fuse states will be displayed
on the second line of the display. As it is reading, picprg will
display every 16th address, just to let you know it is working
correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e61c8"></a>Programming a PIC</h2></div></div><p>With the programmer connected and the processor plugged in
the right direction, press <b  >P</b> to start the
programming process. The data in RAM will be written to the PIC and
the third line will display &ldquo;Programming PIC&rdquo;. If any errors are
found, they will be displayed with the address, the value read from
the PIC during the failed verify and the value expected. Every 16th
address it programs will be displayed, assuring you that it is
still working.</p><p>From this point, it's up to you to learn how to write
programs for the PIC. Many useful sites which can help you on your
way are on the Internet; David Tait's list of PIC resources is the
best starting point.</p><p><a href="3045s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
