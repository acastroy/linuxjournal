As four-processor x86-64 boards take over the high end
of homebrew PCs, we take a look at the systems you'll be
building next year.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c65580.0x1d5d818"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You might say that the trend to 64-bit Linux systems
started in 1994 when Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, then at
Digital, gave Linus Torvalds an Alpha workstation.
But the mass market started to make the move last
year when AMD introduced the first x86-64 processors.
AMD calls the architecture AMD64, and Intel has
followed up with compatible processors under the name
IA-32e. We selected a two-way AMD64 system as Ultimate
Linux Box last year.
</p><p>
Our Ultimate Linux Boxes have sported two processors
since 2000, and it's time to make the move to four.
Now that major vendors are offering Linux systems in
sizes up to SGI's 256 Itanium
processors in its Altix 3000 series, we have to make
it clear that this is the ultimate box you can build,
not the ultimate box that anyone has ever built.
</p><p>
Although we probably say it every year, there's never
been a better selection of Linux-compatible hardware
on the market. IBM has launched a major marketing push
for Linux on POWER, and some people are talking up
Apple's PowerPC-based Power Mac G5 as great for Linux.
The Ultimate Linux Box always has been about a
system that readers can build, however; so we're going to go
where the commodity hardware is.
</p><p>
Timing for this article was a little awkward.
Too late to make it into this year's box, Tyan recently
introduced the four-way SMP Thunder K8QS (S4880),
which is in a new, larger size known as SSI: 13" &times; 16"
or 330mm &times; 407mm. Cases that fit are rare. Still, it's
the first industry-standard four-way, 64-bit motherboard,
and we're thinking about putting one like it into a
tower case next year&mdash;a big tower case, that is.
</p><p>
But, it's clear that four-way x86-64 motherboards are
the new top of the line for Linux box builders, so
we're getting a head start on the trend by using one
of the rackmount bare-bones systems, the Celestica
A8440.
Both the Celestica and another four-way, the Newisys
4300, are popular basic boxes on which Linux box
builders are developing complete systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c65580.0x1d5dad8"></a>
Recommended Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Although user-group mailing lists and other community
fora are great for answering many technical questions,
they tend to be less good for advice on what
hardware to buy. Unfortunately, you're likely to get
secondhand media reviews, justifications of random
stuff someone recently bought and just plain errors.
</p><p>
But that's fine, because the Linux scene already has
an excellent source of hardware recommendations&mdash;the
system specs pages on the small Linux vendors' sites.
If someone in the Linux business is willing to take
phone calls about a particular piece of hardware
and stays in business, that's a pretty good sign.
</p><p>
Some of the hardware the small shops use is on
the expensive side. You see a lot of Supermicro
and Tyan motherboards and Seagate and Maxtor hard
drives, for example. But the good news is
high-quality PC hardware doesn't command as much of a
price premium as it should. Commentators make such
a big deal out of PC hardware being a commodity
that people ignore the fact that even commodities
have different quality levels. As long as the &ldquo;a PC
is a PC&rdquo; meme stays current, the market undervalues
quality hardware.
</p><p>
Linux vendors don't mind home builders free riding
on their hard-earned hardware choices, because hardly
anyone builds PCs for work. If you bookmark a
company's hardware choices as a reference for your
home projects, you're likely to come back to them
when it's time to order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c65580.0x1d5dd40"></a>
Buy or Build?</h2></div></div><p>
If you're reading this far, you probably have strong
opinions about your system's details, including the
visible parts. If you want a cool-looking case
or a weird combination of hardware, you're likely to
want to build. You can save some money that way too.
When you build, you can splash out on expensive
boutique ball-bearing fans, heavy but quiet
heat sinks and other small hardware that's not
cost effective for a vendor to use but that you can
justify by spreading its cost over several generations
of electronics.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you're trying to home-brew a
digital content creation workstation, you're likely
to be out in no-man's-land searching for device drivers for
your video card. The top 3-D cards still have full
support only with proprietary drivers, so don't expect
to treat a high-end 3-D system like a Linux box.
Where the low levels of the system are concerned,
your workstation might as well be a proprietary
UNIX system, because you can't expect community
support when some drivers are closed off from your
view and the view of the experts on the linux-kernel
mailing list.
For now, get anything requiring high-performance 3-D
from a vendor that has a good working relationship
with the video card manufacturer and whose support
you trust.
</p><p>
A good middle ground between buying and building is
to work with a friendly Linux system vendor that lets
you customize the machines you order. It doesn't cost any
more to talk to someone on the phone than to use the
Web configurator, so it's a good idea to rough out the
system you like, place a call and get some feedback.
</p><p>
You might choose to go with a small, friendly vendor
for your systems at work and then build your own
home machines. One advantage of getting systems
from a friendly Linux vendor is burn-in. I suspect
the engineers at Linux vendors have unresolved
anger issues toward hardware&mdash;or maybe they
want to cut back on the number of returned systems.
Pogo uses a battery of burn-in tests based on the
Cerberus Test Control System, which traces its
heritage back to the original VA Research.
</p><p>
Enough introduction, it's time for the parts list.

If you buy no other hardware this year...</b></p><p>
...get a pre-ban HDTV card. In a major setback for
those who choose to build their own entertainment
devices, the US Federal Communications Commission has
approved the so-called Broadcast Flag regulation
for high-definition television (HDTV). That's bad
news for Linux boxes, Ultimate and otherwise. Future
HDTV-capable tuner cards will be required to enforce
a to-be-determined digital rights management (DRM)
regime. This is one product category that won't
get better next year; it'll be worse because of
mandatory DRM. If you live in the US,
if you buy no other PC hardware before the end of 2004, pick
up a pcHDTV card.
</p><p>
The pcHDTV HD-2000 Hi Definition Television Card works
with the open-source player Xine and it will be illegal
to sell next year. You'll still be able to use the
card you stashed this year, though. We give you
fair warning right now that in 2005 <i  >Linux Journal</i>
will cover projects that require pre-ban cards.
Buy now or kick yourself next year.

Ultimate Linux Box 2004 Hardware</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Motherboard/chassis: Celestica A8440 (AMD-8131 Chipset)
</p><p>
High-end motherboards are going to onboard Gigabit
Ethernet. As with other server-oriented hardware, all
the commonly used chipsets have good Linux support.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory:
16x PC2700 2048MB ECC REG (32GB)
</p></li><li><p>
Network interfaces:
BCM5704 10/100/1000 x 2
</p></li><li><p>
RAID: Adaptec ASR2200S
</p></li><li><p>
Storage:
Seagate ST336607LC 36GB U320 SCSI HDD x 4
</p><p>
These aren't the fastest Seagate drives available,
but with 32GB of memory, if we touch them we're
either doing something wrong or running a benchmark.
It's an easy upgrade to 15,000 RPM drives.
</p></li><li><p>
Video:
Appian Rushmore Quad-DVI PCI
</p><p>
Appian's Rushmore card offers four displays at up
to 2048&times;1536 resolution. With everything working
correctly, that would be 25,165,824 pixels or 32
times the area of a conventional 1024 &times; 768 screen.
At press time, we still were dealing with an
interesting issue with XFree86 support for this
card. Instead of four displays, we were getting two
identical copies of two displays. Check out
our Web site for the resolution to the X issue.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
With Fedora Core release 1.92 (FC2 Test 3) installed,
the Ultimate Linux Box put up good numbers on the
benchmarks, as might be expected.
</p><p>
Yes, with this much RAM we took the opportunity to
build a kernel in a tmpfs partition. 2.6.4 with
all defaults set completed in 1 minute 41 seconds.
More detailed benchmark results follow.
