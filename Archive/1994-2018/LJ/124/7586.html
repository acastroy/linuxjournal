<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #124, August 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

For more than a year, <span   class="bold"><b>Terence Ripperda</b></span> has been thinking
about adding <span   class="bold"><b>Page Attribute Table</b></span> (PAT) support to
Linux. Back in mid-2003, the issue did not seem so
important to him, because only the AGP aperture and
framebuffer really would benefit. With <span   class="bold"><b>PCI
Express</b></span>
systems coming out, however, the old workarounds are
too slow. PCI Express lacks AGP's central aperture
that can be marked WC (write-combined) in certain
cases. Instead, individual memory pages must be marked
as WC separately in the page tables. This cannot be
done efficiently using the old ways, but by adding
PAT support, a high level of efficiency still can be
attained. Terence has been working closely with
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> to get something ready for inclusion in the
kernel. Other folks, such as <span   class="bold"><b>Andy
Whitcroft</b></span>, also have been
looking into adding PAT support; so, one way or another,
it seems that this enhancement will go through.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Maneesh Soni</b></span>, acting on a tip from
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span>, has
taken on an annoying <span   class="bold"><b>sysfs</b></span> bug.
Apparently, symbolic
links in sysfs have been following the target that
existed at the time of the link's creation no matter
what, even when the intended target changes during
use. A patch posted by Maneesh causes the target to be
recalculated every time the link is read. Maintaining
a consistent and proper sysfs interface is crucial
to providing a clean global interface into the
kernel. The procfs mishmash is one of the main reasons
sysfs was created in the first place.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Carl-Daniel Hailfinger</b></span> secretly has been implementing a successor for
ATA RAID in 2.6, called raiddetect, and finally unveiled
his work for comment in April 2004. Raiddetect is intended to identify vendor software
RAID superblocks, verify their validity, group them by vendor and set them
up for use. Although Carl-Daniel's work admittedly could have been done as an
extension of <span   class="bold"><b>Wilfried Weissmann</b></span>'s
<span   class="bold"><b>EVMS</b></span> plugin, Carl-Daniel opted for the
easier method of starting from scratch&mdash;though he affirms that his work
could be incorporated into EVMS even now if folks preferred that. So far,
there doesn't seem to be much dissent, and people like <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span> are filled
with praise for Carl-Daniel's work.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tosatti</b></span> has decided to merge
<span   class="bold"><b>Serial ATA</b></span> (SATA) support into the 2.4
tree&mdash;probably one of the last big features to go into 2.4.
Marcelo says the reason for this is that a lot of new computer systems are
shipping with SATA-only disks, and until 2.6 becomes fully stable it makes
the best sense for 2.4 to be able to run on these new systems. The decision
met with some criticism, most notably the counter-contention that the 2.6
tree is plenty stable and specifically includes the same security fixes
that recently went into 2.4. Regardless, it seems that there is at least
some good reason for including SATA support in 2.4, and Marcelo apparently
fully intends to do so.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Herbert Xu</b></span> has written some code to allow
Software Suspend to be compiled as a module, but
with all the hubbub over whether loadable modules
should be unloadable at all, the question of whether
a given feature should be compilable as a module is
becoming less critical. Some developers,
including <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, have been leaving modularity
support out of their driver work, preferring to get
the basic behavior correct and worry about less
important modularity features later. Software Suspend
is apparently one of these as well, and folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Nigel Cunningham</b></span> have expressed
their doubts that a modular Software Suspend is
more valuable than the nonmodular version. The whole
question of modularity seems up in the air
in the 2.6 series, because the ability to load and
unload modules always has been dear to the hearts of
many users, and its disappearance has been more for
the convenience of developers than for users. If a clear
solution to the problem of how to unload
modules properly is found, it is likely that 2.7 would see
the reappearance of that feature.

<h2 class="title">Linux Audio Conference 2004</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Dave Phillips</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #124, August 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

From April 29 through May 2, 2004, the Center
for Arts and Media Technology (ZKM) in
Karlsruhe, Germany, hosted the second International
Linux Audio Conference. Developers from around
the world presented open-source software for
hard-disk recording, software sound synthesis,
music typesetting, digital audio signal processing
and many other sound and music-related areas. Several
concerts and a sound installation demonstrated
how this software can be used for composition and
production. Linux-based music and sound production
hardware, the
Lionstracs Mediastation
and the Hartmann Neuron, also made an appearance. Visitors were able to set
up their own computer-based Linux audio systems
with the assistance of experts from the
AGNULA/Demudi and Planet CCRMA distributions.
</p><p>
The conference showed considerable growth over last
year's successful event. More than 30 topic
presentations took place, and many extra sessions were
held to accommodate requests for more information about
particular topics. All presentations were given
in English and were comprehensible and engaging,
a testament to the linguistic abilities of the
presenters, many of whom were not native English
speakers. Highlight topics included Paul Davis'
demonstration of recent advances in his Ardour
digital audio workstation project, Steve Harris'
exposition of the JAMin audio mastering suite, Fons
Adriaensen's demo of his Aeolus pipe-organ emulator
and Stefan Kersten's introduction to his work with
the SuperCollider3 sound synthesis environment.
</p><p>
Other memorable presentations included Orm
Finnendahl's explanation of his use of common UNIX
tools such as sed and awk in his compositions, Ivica
Ico Bukvic's thoughts on getting Linux into school
music curricula and Dave Topper's report on
his GAIA, a graphic front end for sound synthesis
languages.
</p><p>
With four concerts, a dance, ongoing hardware
demonstrations and various workshops demonstrating
the use of Linux audio software, there was ample
opportunity to hear how Linux audio software
has evolved. Huge kudos to Frank Neumann, Matthias
Nagorni and Goetz Dipper for keeping everything
running smoothly. Vast thanks also to SuSE
and ZKM for their support. See <a href="http://linux-sound.org" target="_self">linux-sound.org</a> for
links to software, recordings and a conference program.
Next year's conference already is scheduled for
ZKM again.

<h2 class="title">Who New? Qunu</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #124, August 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

I always know when I get an e-mail from Murray Gray, because he writes to
me from the future. He's in Australia, near the leading edge of
tomorrow. I'm in California, which is yesterday, relatively speaking.
Murray's subject, however is instantaneous. He's into IM (instant
messaging). And, here's what he's doing about it, with a new project
called Qunu (<a href="http://www.qunu.com" target="_self">www.qunu.com</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Let's say you're stuck in GIMP with a layer problem or have issues
installing a particular printer driver. What are the chances of
getting instant support from someone who knows their stuff and
actually wants to help? Pretty low. You could ask a buddy on your IM
list, visit countless sites, forums or knowledge bases on the Net,
or even go to the manufacturer's Web site. You may eventually find
what you are looking for, but how long can it take sometimes to
achieve resolution?
</p><p>
Now, let's imagine an open IM system that allows you to connect
immediately with the very person you need to talk to, who's on-line
when you are, and who's passionate and knowledgeable in the area you're
having problems. Qunu makes this possible though an innovative
cross-platform SDK that integrates with any software application as
well as a fully fledged standalone application.
</p><p>
In short, it's community helping community. Anyone can download the
software and ask for help, and likewise, anyone can provide help.
Experts can receive direct requests for help or dive into the
pool of requests and help with issues in which they're knowledgeable.
</p><p>
Software publishers and IT companies now have an incredible
opportunity to allow their dedicated, passionate users to evangelize
on their behalf, and an even greater opportunity to connect with
users and solve problems before they end up as PR nightmares.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Qunu traces back to an idea by Joseph E. Trent on the (now defunct)
BeNews forum in January 2000. The idea piqued the interest of Helmar
Rudolph (formerly of Opera Software and Sonork) and Murray, who
joint-financed development by Justin Kirby of openaether.org using his
in-house toolkit for XMPP/Jabber development.
</p><p>
Qunu is based on Jabber's XMPP (eXtensible Message and Presence
Protocol) and Mozilla. Here's Murray's technical case:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The core portability layer of Qunu is a thin wrapper around the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR), which has been released under the APL
in the spirit of the libraries it's directly built upon. The Jabber
protocol then uses the APR wrapper for threads and networking
portability. The XML parsing library that is used is the Xerces-c XML
parser, whose maturity and feature set are truly astounding.
</p><p>
Qunu is both a cross-platform SDK framework and standalone
application, making it suitable for any type of implementation
environment, software or topic area. For reasons of brevity, we have
glossed over the details of setting up Jabber streams, creating XUL
windows and handling events, but suffice it to say, the Mozilla
application framework and Jabber protocols are complex and elegant,
and Qunu has leveraged this into a useful and extensible framework.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Murray invites readers to download the code, play with it and
contribute improvements back to the new community.

<h2 class="title">Linux 2.6-Based Box Set: SuSE 9.1 Professional</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Don Marti</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #124, August 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

If you've been reading about the 2.6 kernel in <i  >Linux Journal</i> but waiting until a distribution integrates
it nicely before you take the plunge, have a look at
SuSE 9.1 Professional.

</p><p>
The install is nothing special, which is a good
thing considering the current standard for
high-end Linux distributions. A great feature is the check
for any updated packages from the Net before letting
you out on your own. If a security problem comes up,
new SuSE 9.1 installs from CD will get the fix as
part of the normal install.
</p><p>
KDE 3.2, the default desktop environment, is slick,
with features including easy CD burning, a file
manager that lets you drag and drop files anywhere
you're allowed to sftp to and great GNU Privacy
Guard integration in KMail.
</p><p>
The hard part about doing a Linux distribution, however, is
hardware support, and this is where SuSE 9.1 really
stands out. SaX, SuSE's X configuration tool,
set up a multihead display and a Wacom tablet
with point-and-click ease&mdash;no configuration or
documentation reading required. USB printers and
storage devices on our test system also simply work.
</p><p>
Although the price is higher than a lot of
distributions, the box set includes good printed user
and administrator guides, along with install support.
We recommend this distribution for power users of
other OSes who are trying Linux for the first time.
</p><p>
SuSE has a good record for laptop support, too, so
watch for more on SuSE 9.1 from Doc Searls, who is
running this distribution on his IBM ThinkPad.

Just as in the 1990s the COTS sector caught up with
the military sector in applications of cryptography,
this decade will see the self-same overtaking but
this time of traffic analysis. You do not need to
examine content if you can deploy enough sensors and
make sense of their findings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Dan Geer, on the Politech mailing list
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Brazil hosted the recent Fourth International Forum on Free Software,
held in the World Social Forum's stronghold of Porto Alegre. There,
jazzy pop star Gilberto Gil, now Brazil's minister of culture, promised
to &ldquo;tropicalize digitalization&rdquo;, presumably a reference to bridging the
developed and developing worlds. If Extremadura is the harbinger, those
tropicalized digits will be globally connected, fiercely patriotic, and
free as sunshine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Bruce Sterling in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many on Jack Valenti's side of the divide treasure
their creative freedom and fight like dogs against
any who would block it. They would never dream of
permitting a system in which every film had to be
approved by the state, but they are advocating a
system in which every program has to be approved
by the state, because a lot of them think that all
programs come either from faceless corporations like
Microsoft or from criminal vandals.
</p><p>
We software creators need to insist that creative applies to us.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Joe Buck, in a comment on lessig.org
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Nat [Friedman] used to say &ldquo;If you write a thousand
lines of code, you are violating someone's patent
today.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The picture is not pretty for anyone in the software
industry.
</p><p>
But this is similar to what happens to biology
students: in their first four semesters as they
learn about all the dangers, infections, vectors for
infections and bacteria, they stop eating everything,
they start washing their hands with special products,
they double clean their utensils, they wash their
fruits ten times a day.
</p><p>
Two years later they are eating food with their bare
hands again.
