Senior Editor Doc Searls has spent a good portion of the last year or so
talking to IT guys inside some big-name companies about how and where they
are using Linux and open source. More than a single story, Doc's tapped
in to a revolution in the way IT departments work. He's dubbed the
revolution DIY-IT. Response to his reports has been overwhelming, so
we've launched a new SSC Web site devoted to the DIY-IT movement. Here's
Doc describing in his own words what this new site is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Early last year, Don Marti assigned me to write a long piece about
&ldquo;how Linux helps make smart companies smarter&rdquo;. What I found was
there's a lot more going on out there than anybody's talking about in
the mainstream press, or pretty much anywhere. It was nothing less
than a vast reform movement inside IT (information technology)
organizations everywhere&mdash;one in which the demand side was starting
to supply itself. Much of this has been with Linux and other open-source
tools and applications, but the phenomenon goes far beyond
that. It's a cultural as well as a technical revolution, yet it's also
very practical. It's about getting stuff done.
</p><p>
So, we decided to start a site on the Web where people involved in
what we call DIY-IT&mdash;Do It Yourself IT&mdash;could talk about their
work and report on trends happening in the field. We call it Doc Searls'
IT Garage
(<a href="http://garage.docsearls.com" target="_self">garage.docsearls.com</a>)
or just IT Garage: a place for &ldquo;News, ideas and
real-world stories about how IT folks solve their own problems&rdquo;. If it
takes off, maybe it will become a print magazine, but we don't know
yet. We're still shaking the thing down and signing up regular
contributors.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
If your company is part of the revolution or you'd like it to be, check
out the site. See what you can learn and take back to the rest of the
team. Or, if you've got your own story to share, write about it on the
site.
</p><p>
Back on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> site, after constructing
this year's Ultimate Linux Box, Don Marti decided he needed to write
about building the ultimate quiet Linux box. His article &ldquo;This Linux Box
Is Too Loud!&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7601" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7601</a>) is a roundup of
computer-silencing techniques that work under Linux.
</p><p>
Finally, if you appreciated this month's article &ldquo;Linux Serial
Consoles for Servers and Clusters&rdquo;, be sure to read Poul E. J. Petersen's
Web article, &ldquo;Project Hydra: the USB Multiheaded Monster&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6518" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6518</a>). Petersen
writes, &ldquo;It
would be really cool to have a dedicated, remotely accessible console
server with a lot of serial ports connected to all of our
servers.&rdquo; Read
about how they accomplished exactly that using &ldquo;a readily available USB
bus with USB-to-serial adapters&rdquo;.
</p><p>
As always, if you or your company has a cool new project or has found a
better way of handling everyday tasks, send me an article proposal at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.
