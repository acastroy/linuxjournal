The more Linux servers you're responsible for, the more that
serial consoles can save you
money, space and headaches by easing remote administration duties.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Managing large numbers of Linux and UNIX systems takes a lot of
organization, automation and careful use of technology. A significant
chunk of one's time as a system administrator is spent building
infrastructure to make managing those systems easier. Doing so improves
flexibility, recoverability and reduces downtime.
All of this hopefully results in less stress and longer vacations. This
article discusses
one of those simple technologies that helps accomplish all of the above,
serial consoles.

Figure 1. Managing Many Servers from a Console Server
</p></div></div><p>
Serial consoles always have been a standard feature of
enterprise UNIX hardware.
Modern high-density server and cluster configurations
sometimes can squeeze more than 50 servers in a 19" rack, so having
monitors and keyboards for each one is unthinkable. Although
KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) switches can connect many servers to a small
number of monitors and keyboards, they are expensive and even more so
with remote access features. Serial consoles allow you to take racks or
shelves of servers and have all their consoles available all the time,
from anywhere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5660"></a>
Consoles Defined</h2></div></div><p>
The console is a simple I/O device, initialized early in the kernel
boot process to convey informational messages as the system comes up. Once the
operating system starts running startup scripts, the console can
be used to recover an ailing system or to get input from the system
administrator interactively, like Red Hat's Kudzu does. One compelling feature of
serial consoles is never having to drive in to work because a system
is hung up at reboot asking for input for fsck. After the system is
up completely, the console usually becomes a login terminal, sometimes
a graphical one. The console also can be used as a last resort
method of reporting problems inside the kernel. Under these panic conditions it is
not possible always to write to log files or network log servers, so
messages are reported to the console. For this reason and many more,
consoles on servers should be a simple device, and a serial port is the
simplest device included on standard system configurations. For those
last-minute panic messages, one could add a console device that supports
buffering and logging, so you never miss a moment of the excitement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab57c0"></a>
Hardware Support</h2></div></div><p>
What we are talking about here is booting up a system without using an
attached keyboard, mouse or video monitor. Some motherboards may complain
without a directly attached keyboard, but this requirement usually can be changed in
the BIOS configuration. In fact, with the recent popularity of USB keyboards,
most BIOS versions do not care about missing keyboards. If you are
using a system that was designed to be a server, you may be even more
fortunate. Several vendors have started adding extra functionality to
their BIOS versions to better support serial consoles from power-on.
These features sometimes include power-on system test (POST)
output and BIOS configuration access over the serial port. Depending on
your needs, you can select your hardware accordingly by checking the
vendor specifications. Even without BIOS support, you still
can use serial consoles quite effectively on almost any PC system.
</p><p>
This is not a perfect solution, though, and your average PC hardware does not
provide all of the features available in typical enterprise-class UNIX
hardware. PC BIOS versions do not have the concept of a boot monitor
(see the &ldquo;What Is a Boot Monitor?&rdquo; sidebar), nor can you perform a hardware
halt of the OS as you can in enterprise UNIX hardware. For many applications
this is okay, but when more functionality is needed add-on
hardware options are available, and I discuss them later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5978"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is a Boot Monitor?</b></p><p>
Classic UNIX hardware (Sun, HP, SGI and so on) usually has a feature called
a boot monitor. Think of it as a tiny operating system built into Flash
memory on the motherboard of a server or workstation. Sometimes called a
boot console or prom console, they function as a PC BIOS and
a bootloader in one. They are responsible for understanding all manner
of boot devices and getting the kernel image into RAM and running.
Most boot monitors can boot from the network for diskless operation or
recovery from a failed boot device. One key feature of boot monitors is
they stand between the console and the kernel, so it often is possible
to suspend or halt the running OS and drop to the boot monitor with a
magic keystroke. Then, even better, the OS resumes where it left off.
This allows you to diagnose hardware problems or forcibly reboot the system
even if the kernel has died. In a PC system, only a skeletal set
of hardware support exists in the BIOS, and the rest must be provided by
small chunks of code provided in Flash memory on the hardware itself.
</p></div><p>
Most PC hardware BIOS versions can be configured only with a directly
attached keyboard and video monitor. Luckily most come with usable default
settings, so this is not normally an issue. If it is, you may need to have
the system initially configured with direct attached video and keyboard
and then switch to serial console. In my experience, I have rarely needed to
do this; it needs to be done only once during initial hardware setup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5be0"></a>
Software Configuration Overview</h2></div></div><p>
As packaged by most distributions, the Linux kernel and bootloader select
the directly attached video controller and keyboard as console, but this
is easily changed. When a PC-based system boots, the bootloader is the
first program to be loaded off the disk. The three major bootloaders
in popular use on Linux systems are GRUB, LILO and SYSLINUX (used
on boot floppies); all of them support serial consoles. Next,
the Linux kernel needs to be told to use a serial port for its console,
which can be handled at compile time or by passing kernel command-line
options from the bootloader configuration. Finally, if you want to be
able to log in on the console, you need to configure a getty process
to run after the system is up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5ce8"></a>
Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
We discuss the kernel configuration next because it is a prerequisite
to understanding the bootloader config later on. The most flexible
way to configure the kernel console is with the options passed on the
kernel command line. You can append arguments to the command line from
the bootloader. Here is an example of the kernel command-line syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
console=ttyS0,9600n8
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells the kernel to use ttyS0 (the first serial port discovered by
the kernel), running at 9,600 baud, no parity and 8 bits. The kernel
defaults to one stop bit. This is the most common speed and configuration
for a serial console, which is why most serial ports and terminals
default to 9600n8. It is possible to append more than one
<tt  >console=</tt>
argument to the command line; kernel messages then are output to all of
them, but only the last one is used for input.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab5ef8"></a>
Bootloader Configuration: GRUB</h2></div></div><p>
GRUB is a flexible bootloader with excellent support for serial
consoles. When properly configured, GRUB allows multiple devices
to be used as a console. Listing 1 shows an example grub.conf file (usually
/boot/grub/grub.conf and symlinked to /etc/grub.conf) as configured
by the Red Hat/Fedora Core installer. Yours may be slightly different.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab6000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

# after making changes to this file
# NOTICE:You have a /boot partition.
#        This means that all kernel
#        and initrd paths are relative
#        to /boot/, eg.
#        root (hd0,1)
#        kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/hda6
#        initrd /initrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/hda

        kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.20-8 ro root=LABEL=/
        initrd /initrd-2.4.20-8.img
</pre></div><p>
The first thing to do is remove all splashimage directives. In some
early versions, these directives confuse GRUB and make it default to the video console.
Then add a serial and terminal line. The serial line initializes the
serial port to the proper baud and settings. In the terminal line, we
configure GRUB to send prompts to both the serial port and to the
keyboard and monitor. You can press any key on either,
and it becomes the default console. The <tt  >--timeout=10</tt> argument tells
GRUB to default to the first device listed in the terminal line after
ten seconds. We also modified the kernel command line to include the
option that tells the Linux kernel to use the serial port as console.
Listing 2 shows the complete modified grub.conf file.

Bootloader Configuration: LILO</h2></div></div><p>
The LILO bootloader, although much more mature than GRUB, is less
feature-rich.
We must configure LILO and pass options to the kernel to use a
serial port. To do this, we add:

<pre     class="programlisting">

serial=&lt;port&gt;,&lt;bps&gt;&lt;parity&gt;&lt;bits&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2ab6630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where port
0 is the first serial port detected by LILO. Also, the
<tt  >append=</tt>
line is modified to include the kernel options. After modifying the
/etc/lilo.conf file, be sure to run LILO to update the bootloader.
The completed lilo.conf file is shown in Listing 3.

Bootloader Configuration: SYSLINUX</h2></div></div><p>
SYSLINUX is a bootloader designed for use with DOS/FAT formatted
bootable floppies. Red Hat/Fedora Core Linux uses SYSLINUX for both the
install boot and rescue floppies. In order to install or
recover from boot floppies over serial console, the floppies need
to be modified. We have added the <tt  >console=</tt> and
<tt  >text</tt>
directive to the append line, and we have removed the extra
boot selections present in Red Hat's original file. The first
line initializes and directs SYSLINUX to use serial port 0
(aka /dev/ttyS0) and defaults to 9600n8. Using this modified
boot floppy, we can install the OS over the serial console. Red Hat's text
installation option works quite nicely this way. Using the
above modifications, you can convert any SYSLINUX boot floppy to
use serial consoles. This procedure also works for ISOLINUX,
which is a spinoff of SYSLINUX used on bootable CD-ROMs.

Enabling Logins and Tuning</h2></div></div><p>
As stated before, the console can become
a login terminal after the system is up. For this to happen, the getty entries in
/etc/inittab must be modified. The standard /etc/inittab
starts mingetty on virtual consoles only. Because mingetty is
not suitable for serial terminals, we must use something else.
Many getty-type programs are available, but agetty is included
with almost every Linux distribution, so we
use it. Also, make sure the system
boots to nongraphical mode, normally runlevel 3.
Some Linux distributions default to an X login, usually at
runlevel 5, if any X packages were installed.
The default runlevel is determined on the initdefault line.
To enable agetty on serial lines, you can modify the initdefault
line in /etc/inittab:

<pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault:
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2aad758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and add a line for agetty:

<pre     class="programlisting">
co:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty ttyS0 9600 vt100
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells agetty to start waiting for logins on /dev/ttyS0 at 9,600bps, using vt100 terminal emulation. You may want to keep the original
mingetty entries to allow a directly attached keyboard and monitor to
be used for logins. If not, simply comment them out. Where root can
log in from is controlled strictly; in order for root to
log in from ttyS0, you must add the device to the /etc/securetty
file.
</p><p>
Finally, if your system has created a /etc/ioctl.save file, delete
or rename it. This file is used to save console settings between
reboots. If the system was booted using a directly attached keyboard and
monitor, this file attempts to restore improper settings. A new one
is created when you reboot using the serial console.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2aad968"></a>
Tweaking for Red Hat/Fedora Core</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat's bootup scripts use escape sequences, so the OK, PASS and FAIL
messages show up in color. This can confuse serial consoles, so it is best
to disable it. Simply modify /etc/sysconfig/init, and change the
<tt  >BOOTUP=</tt>
line to say <tt  >BOOTUP=serial</tt>. This will prevent the use of color messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2aadb20"></a>
Cabling</h2></div></div><p>
Serial cabling can cause some confusion. Basically, there are two kinds of
serial ports, DCE (Data Communication Equipment) and DTE (Data Terminal
Equipment). The ports differ in how specific signals are connected to pins
on the connector. Data communication with serial ports uses separate
transmit and receive wires, so when connecting two pieces of equipment
together, one must make sure the transmit wire on one side connects
to the receive wire on the other side. As long as you are connecting
a DCE device to a DTE device you can use a regular straight-through
cable, where each pin is connected to the same pin on the other side of
the cable. If you are connecting devices of the same type, however,
you must use a special cable or adapter, called a null modem, so
the signals are swapped properly. DTE devices usually are terminals,
computers and printers. DCE devices are designed to connect
directly to computers, such as modems and serial mice.
</p><p>
In addition to the
data transmit and receive wires, a number of handshaking
signals are used to control the flow of data, so one side is not talking too
fast for the other to understand. These signals also must be swapped by the null modem.
To add to the confusion, two popular connectors are in use for
serial ports, the 9-pin DB9 and the 25-pin DB25. These can come
in both male and female varieties. In almost every case, the devices used
for serial consoles (terminals, computers and console servers) are all DTE,
which means you need a null modem of some sort. These are
available in the form of adapters and cables. Most off-the-shelf units
work fine, but if you want to solder your own, check the on-line
Resources section for links to pinouts and cable diagrams.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2aadc80"></a>
Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, we have described a Linux system that can boot up without
a directly attached keyboard and monitor. It uses the first serial
port for all informational messages as the system boots and accepts
logins from that console once the system is up. But to what should
you connect that console port? There is a world of possibilities.
If you have no particular need for remote-console access, you simply
can leave the port unconnected until you need to maintain the system.
You can use a computer or laptop connected over a null modem with the
minicom program to access your system's console. Simply configure
minicom to speak to an unused serial port, set the speed to 9,600 baud, 8
bits, no parity and 1-stop bit (aka 9600-8n1). Cable the systems together,
then watch the system boot and eventually ask you to log in.
</p><p>
For remote access to a server's console, you can set up a console
concentrator, which is a lot like a terminal server. It can be a homegrown Linux box with multiport serial cards, giving you as many ports
as you have servers. With this kind of setup, you can access all your
servers' consoles by logging in to a single dedicated Linux box.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bd580.0x2aadde0"></a>
Specialized Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
If you like the idea of remote access to your consoles but want more of
an appliance, a number of products can help. Cyclades
(<a href="http://www.cyclades.com" target="_self">www.cyclades.com</a>) makes a console concentrator
called AlterPath;
it is reasonably priced and comes in 1, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 48-port models.
The AlterPath units run Linux internally from Flash memory. A
Web interface is used for configuration, or you can modify the configuration files
directly through a shell login.
</p><p>
The most flexible way to configure the Cyclades unit is
to present the consoles using Cyclades' modified SSH d&aelig;mon.
This way you can SSH directly to each
connected server's console port, which is identified by a textual name
you choose. So, to connect to a server identified as server hooked to a
Cyclades unit with a hostname of cyclades as the user matt, the command
would look like: <tt  >ssh matt:server@cyclades</tt>. (The
colon syntax is a Cyclades modification to sshd, allowing you to pass a port
name.) This
setup is easy to use,
and you even can set up SSH private key authentication.
</p><p>
Other vendors make console concentrators or servers,
including Digi (<a href="http://www.digi.com" target="_self">www.digi.com</a>), Equinox (<a href="http://www.equinox.com" target="_self">www.equinox.com</a>)
and Raritan (<a href="http://www.raritan.com" target="_self">www.raritan.com</a>). All of these vendors
offer network-attached serial
console products.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, serial consoles on standard PC hardware lack some
of the features available on enterprise UNIX hardware.
One solution is PC Weasel (<a href="http://www.realweasel.com" target="_self">www.realweasel.com</a>), which comes in the
form of a PCI or ISA card. This device emulates a video card
and translates all output to the serial port as normal terminal escape
sequences. Input from the serial port is translated into PC keyboard
scan codes. Because it looks like a video card to the system, the system
allows it
full access to BIOS and POST. Additional features allow you to do a
remote hard reset. The PC Weasel also has its own processor, so it
is available even if the host into which it is plugged crashes.

Specialized Software</h2></div></div><p>
If you would like to build your own console concentrator,
some options are available to make it a little better than a simple box with a lot of
serial ports. Conserver (<a href="http://www.conserver.com" target="_self">www.conserver.com</a>) is an
open-source
software package for managing systems connected to serial consoles.
It supports SSL encryption and is highly configurable.
