Robert L. &ldquo;r0ml&rdquo; Lefkowitz (that's a zero, not an o...you figure it out)
is a tall, smart, charismatic and good-humored man with a shaved head
and a red clown nose in his pocket that he sometimes wears to explain,
visually, that he's &ldquo;just a bozo&rdquo;. Except for the nose, he's not.
Lefkowitz is an IT veteran who stepped out of the frying pan of Wall
Street and into the fire of the telco business, specifically from Merrill
Lynch to his current job as Chief Technical Architect and VP Information
Technology for AT&amp;T Wireless. He calls himself
geek-in-chief.
</p><p>
r0ml is a longtime advocate of open source. But he's also the rare
open-source advocate who tells you all the ways open source either is
inadequate as a development methodology or is lacking the tools
and solutions large IT organizations require. He makes it his job both
to prod the Open Source community to produce the missing goods and to
find new goods for possible adoption by his company. He likes when his
own engineers already have found them.
</p><p>
During the July 2003 O'Reilly Open Source Convention, Lefkowitz gave a talk
titled &ldquo;Six Missing Open-Source Projects&rdquo;. It was as much a primer on
The Real World of IT as a call to action for the open-source programmers
who packed the room. Relationship Management was one of his projects.
&ldquo;Relationships are more important to most companies than
code&rdquo;, he said,
which is why they spend more money on marketing than on programming. He
said there is plenty of CRM&mdash;customer resource management&mdash;software
out there for big companies, but none yet from the open-source world.
There also is none for following relationships between IT departments and
development communities. There were so many questions such a system
could answer. Which industries have the highest patch-submission to
running-copies ratio? What percentage of bug reports come from financial
services firms? How about from other industries? Who's working on what,
anyway? And for how long?
</p><p>
He also called for help with asset management,
distributed cron, change management, messaging,
single sign-on and source termination. He said we
should work to create a definitive literature for
problem domains to make it easier to integrate open-source systems. He
called for open-source developers
to start thinking about operations&mdash;accounting and
financial systems, help desk automation, customer
relations and marketing. &ldquo;All the stuff businesses
care about.&rdquo;
</p><p>
During the Open Source Business Conference in San Francisco, March 2004, r0ml
gave a talk titled &ldquo;(More) Missing Open-Source Projects&rdquo;. In it he
proposed four criteria that must be met for open-source projects to take
root:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Everybody (for some definition of everybody) needs it or can use it.
</p></li><li><p>
Those who use it (everybody, by definition above) want to improve
it (for some definition of improve).
</p></li><li><p>
Significant business value associated with the use of the software
does not reside in the software itself.
</p></li><li><p>
It's cool.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
He opened his talk by holding up two CDs and explaining they were
what was left of a telecommunications billing system called Flexcell,
which was orphaned when AT&amp;T Wireless ate Vanguard Wireless, the North
Carolina company that wrote it. &ldquo;How cool would it be if there were an
open-source company in North Carolina?&rdquo; r0ml quipped, tongue planted
deeply in his cheek. &ldquo;That would be fortuitous. Particularly if they
were interested in enterprise systems.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He went on to explain that telecommunications billing systems were
terrific ways to show off micropayment chops. Phone billing is
personalized, goes down to the second and keeps track of many variables
all at once. &ldquo;Very kewl&rdquo;, he said. Then, the pitch:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So we are interested in testing the hypothesis. How will you take
something this cool and turn it into an open-source project.
Would anybody actually be interested in working on that? We won't
invest a heap of money. But if other people are willing to invest
some time or energy or money, then certainly that would encourage us
to work with them a little bit.
</p><p>
So the offer I'm making, if anybody is interested, is doing the
world's largest and coolest micropayment system, I've got the source
code. (And) I do have authorization to look into how to open source
such a thing. I'll be happy to take any licenses or whatnot. It's
all open for discussion.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he pitched CRM: &ldquo;Since I was so successful at convincing you that
billing systems are really cool, I'd like to give it to you that CRM
systems are really cool.&rdquo; Next, he detailed a peer-to-peer CRM system he
called Carester. He went on to pitch projects in visual programming,
business process integration (BPI), messaging and business intelligence
(data warehousing).
&ldquo;Other than 'kewlness', is there any other reason why open source
doesn't tackle billing, CRM, BPI and business
intelligence?&rdquo; he asked.
Is it scale? Performance? Lack of a market? &ldquo;Maybe this just isn't a
value network that open source can ensconce itself in. I don't know. I'm
just an open-source guy and a bozo in IT.&rdquo; Then he brought out the nose.
</p><p>
It was a downbeat talk&mdash;kind of a Swiss cheese treat where all they
serve is the holes.
Later in a telephone interview, I asked r0ml to name some examples of
cases where open source was succeeding, even in the categories he had
mentioned. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Take the data warehouse space. You're dealing with expensive,
specialized hardware. Teradata NCR. Old style hardware-software
bundles that do large specialized databases. Now they have a
competitor, Netezza (<a href="http://netezza.com" target="_self">netezza.com</a>). When a query comes into a
Netezza box, it hits a quad-CPU that's running Red Hat Linux and
PostgreSQL. Since PostgresSQL has a BSD license, they hacked it to
do all this funky parallelization, so they can run it on their
platform, which is kind of a blade thing with these souped-up disks.
The executive, if you will, that does all the dispatching to all the
subnodes and collects all the responses and sends them back to make
these special-purpose queries, is Linux-based. If I buy them, I'm
buying special-purpose hardware that's able to come into the market
to undercut the established players. And they can do that because
they build their stuff up from open-source basics like Linux and
PostgreSQL, which they can take and adapt to their needs. They're
doing DIY: Do-It-Yourself. They're being smart and resourceful. I
like that.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The DIY-IT environment, r0ml says, is a complicated place. And, it will
never submit to simplistic DIY efforts, least of all those that limit
their interest to open source:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Most environments are mixed. In some mixed environments, especially
those using large enterprise-class software, you have some projects
that probably never will be handled by open source and probably
never come from anybody other than a big vendor....Here at AT&amp;T
Wireless, none of the large enterprise-class software we're using is
available in open source, outside of databases. Our billing system
uses Siebel on Sun. It also runs on HP-UX, AIX or Windows. But not
Linux. Our billing system runs on something other than Linux. We
also use Vitria business ware, which just added Linux support.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
On the other hand, he said, &ldquo;There are two classes of vendors in this space now:
those that say they'll deliver products on Linux any day now and those
that are thinking about whether there's a market. Meanwhile, there's a
market.&rdquo; In other words, it's catch-up time.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, your bread-and-butter enterprise systems are going to be
provided by vendors, not by customers. Sometimes a vendor drives
things. For example, The Wall Street Linux Roundtable was sponsored by
Intel. There were representatives of various vendors including Reuters,
which does a lot of business on Wall Street. &ldquo;When you have
representatives from Deutche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch,
Goldman Sachs, all sitting in the same room saying, 'We want stuff on
Linux,' the vendors are going to go back to the office and say 'We
underestimated the size of the market.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
Back at the Open Source Business Conference, I led a panel on DIY-IT
that included r0ml, Kevin Foreman of RealNetworks, Win Coekaerts of
Oracle and Ted Shelton of CallTrex. Everybody made interesting points,
and
each panelist said something important about what each kind of company
contributes to the market ecosystem. Wim Coekaerts, for example, made
this point about testing:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's not just about contributing source code. It's about having the
resources in hardware. Big iron hardware that you run test suites
on and you do stuff with. There is the communication that you have
internally. That's how a big part of what we contribute is testing.
We have to do that for our customers. They expect a product to be
reasonably well tested and to meet minimal criteria. Also, if you
look at other UNIX operating systems or Windows, hardware and software
come from the same company&mdash;Solaris on SPARC, AIX on PowerPC and so
on. The companies themselves that built those systems have the
hardware to do the testing. They've had tons of people dedicated to
working with Oracle to run the database on their platforms. The
testing involves a very small community. Now if you look at Linux,
none of the distribution developers can afford the big iron
hardware. But what we're doing now is working with the distributions
to get the hardware vendors to participate in the testing. So we're
trying to set up this virtual Linux test environment where...we'll
deal with Dell, HP and other companies to say, &ldquo;Here is a subset of
tests you should run at the vendor side, in your early cycles. So
that when they ship a hardware product, it has been pre-tested. In
the past they didn't do that. You have the hardware specification
list, you get a CD and good luck.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ted Shelton offered an interesting answer to r0ml's question about
what it would take for open source to appear in some of these large-scale
enterprise categories:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I've heard that things like CRM and ERP are not going to be
addressed by open source. If you only look at open source as a
very broad-based group of otherwise disconnected people coming
together to do something, that's probably true. But sometimes you
get a company that builds a big solution in a vertical market and
decides to take it out in the open-source market, because they
realize their profits are in selling hardware, not software. And
they've now developed a big community that provides bug fixes and
applications running on top of it. That's Asterisk
(<a href="http://www.asterisk.org" target="_self">www.asterisk.org</a>, the open-source Linux PBX).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then Ted turned to Wim, and said, &ldquo;So, when Oracle gets done buying
PeopleSoft, why not open source all their stuff?&rdquo; Ted did it for laughs,
but you could see some heads in the audience nodding along.
