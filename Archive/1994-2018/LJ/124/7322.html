Hacking this reliable, inexpensive platform can be
your first step to a successful wireless project.
Chain access points together to cover a wide area,
crank up the power level, get more working space in
Flash memory and more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xebf348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Wireless networking has become a mass-market technology, and the price of
802.11 or Wi-Fi gear has fallen to commodity levels. Several thousand
competitors with virtually identical products now are vying for your Wi-Fi
dollars. In this kind of competitive space it is natural for manufacturers
to seek the lowest cost alternatives. Their choice? Linux, of course.
</p><p>
Linux has become the premium OS for inexpensive, feature-packed wireless
networking. Linksys, one of the major wireless players, turned to Linux
for its 802.11g next-generation Wi-Fi devices.
When Cisco bought Linksys in early 2003, it inherited both the Linux
devices and an emerging feud over the unreleased GPL source code. After
several months of lobbying by open-source enthusiasts, Cisco relented
and released the source.
</p><p>
The Linksys WRT54G product (Figure 1) is especially interesting due to its low
price and internal hardware. The WRT54G contains a four-port Ethernet hub,
an Ethernet WAN port, support for the new high-speed 54MB/s
802.11g wireless protocol and backward compatibility with older
802.11b devices.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7322f1.large.jpg"><img src="7322f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. For under $100 US, the Linksys WRT54G is a capable
Linux platform with 16MB of RAM, a 125MHz processor and support for 802.11b
and g.
</p></div></div><p>
But what the WRT54G lacks is what makes it interesting. Under the
hood the unit sports a 125MHz MIPS processor with 16MB of RAM.
This is more than enough horsepower to run some serious applications, so
why not add some?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xebf710"></a>
Setting Up the Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>
The latest source on the Linksys site is about 145MB in size and contains
a complete toolchain for MIPS cross development (see &ldquo;The Linksys WRT54G
Source Tree&rdquo; sidebar).
</p><p>
Follow the instructions for creating symlink and PATH additions in the
README file in the WRT54G/src subdirectory. Then
<tt  >cd</tt> to the router
subdirectory and run <tt  >make menuconfig</tt>. Keep the standard options for
your first build, and click through to create your configuration files.
<tt  >cd</tt> up one level to the WRT54G/src directory and type
<tt  >make</tt>. That's
all there is to it. A file called code.bin is created in the
WRT54G/image directory containing a compressed cramfs filesystem and
a Linux 2.4.20 kernel.
</p><p>
Now comes the scary part&mdash;how do you get this new firmware on to your
Linksys? There are two methods, by tftp or through the Web-based firmware
upgrade interface. I suggest you use the Web upgrade for your first try.
</p><p>
Surf to your Linksys box&mdash;the default address is 192.168.1.1&mdash;and
log in. Select Firmware Upgrade from the Administration menu and upload
your code.bin file. The router now restarts.
Congratulations, you have just modded your Linksys box.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xebfad8"></a>
The Ping Hack</h2></div></div><p>
The existence of Linux on the WRT54G was discovered through a bug in the
ping utility in the Diagnostics menu. Firmware versions prior to 1.42.2
allowed arbitrary code to be run from the ping window if surrounded
by back-ticks. If you have a box with the older firmware, try typing
<tt  >`ls -l /`</tt> in the ping window's IP address field.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;</em></span>&mdash;a listing of
the root directory magically appears.
</p><p>
The ping hack allows curious folks to explore their boxes without
modifying the source. But exploring by way of the ping window is slow and
tedious. What we really need is a shell on the box.
</p><p>
By expanding the ping hack in the source code, a custom firmware
image can be created with the full power of a Linux shell over the Web
interface. See the on-line Resources section URLs on how to create the
command shell.
</p><p>
But why stop there? The default firmware's cramfs filesystem leaves 200K
of Flash memory free. There is room for many useful applications, such
as telnet or Secure Shell or perhaps even a VPN client or server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xebfd98"></a>
The wl Command</h2></div></div><p>
One useful command supplied by Linksys in binary form
only is wl. The wl command contains several dozen internal commands that
control wireless settings, including the popular power adjustment
setting. Typing <tt  >wl</tt> with no parameters produces a complete list of its
capabilities.
</p><p>
The default power setting on the WRT54G is 28 milliwatts, and this setting
cannot be changed externally. But by using the ping hack or a shell, you
can change this with wl, using the txpwr subcommand and a number between
1 and 84 milliwatts. This number raises or lowers the default power setting
until the next reboot.
</p><p>
Increasing the power setting or replacing the stock antennas may
increase your radio output and violate local laws. If you replace the
stock antennas and lower the power setting, your unit's range can be
extended significantly while remaining within legal radio power limits.
</p><p>
The WRT54G supports two external antennas and
automatically balances between them depending on which received the last
active packet. When
adding a more powerful external antenna, this is not the setup that you want. You
need to force the unit to choose the high power antenna every time. This
is done with <tt  >wl txant</tt> for receiving and <tt  >wl
antdiv</tt> for sending. A 0
parameter forces the left antenna coupling and a 1 forces the right, as you face the front panel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xec0108"></a>
Adding Secure Shell (SSH)</h2></div></div><p>
One enterprising individual ported the entire OpenSSH toolchain to the
Linksys box. Unfortunately, the size of the OpenSSH binary means that
many standard Linksys functions must be removed to make room. Plus, the
resulting RAM requirements are at the limits of available memory.
What is needed is an SSH server with a small memory footprint, and the
Dropbear server fits the bill nicely. Matt Johnson designed the Dropbear
SSH d&aelig;mon specifically to run in memory-constrained systems such as
the Linksys.
</p><p>
The standard Linksys Linux implementation lacks many of the normal
files needed for multiuser Linux systems. Two of these&mdash;passwd and
groups in the /etc directory&mdash;are required by the vast majority of
Linux applications. In order to run the Dropbear server, we need to add
these files to the Flash build.
</p><p>
By creating a passwd file with a root entry and no password and a matching
groups file, we can make Dropbear almost happy enough to run. These files are
copied to the /etc directory of the Flash image and are read-only
on the Linksys.
</p><p>
When running, Dropbear also needs to access a private key that is used for
SSH handshaking and authentication, as well as a known_hosts file containing
the public keys of approved client machines. Generating the private key
with the dropbearkey program is a snap, but storing it on the Linksys is
a bit trickier.
</p><p>
The WRT54G contains a hash map of key name and value pairs located in
nonvolatile storage called nvram. The bundled nvram utility and API
allows us to read and write to this memory area. The Dropbear private
key and our public key ID from id_rsa.pub in our home .ssh directory
are stored in nvram and copied to /var in the RAM disk on system start.
</p><p>
We compile Dropbear with support for key-file authorization and now have
a secure way to log in to the Linksys. If you need password login, the
Dropbear code can be patched to read the system password from nvram
and to add the ability for password logins as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xec03c8"></a>
Increasing Flash Memory Compression</h2></div></div><p>
After adding such utilities as SSH and telnetd, you soon find your
Linksys firmware image bumping the limits of the Flash storage space on
the device. What you need is a filesystem with better compression than
cramfs offers, one that is compatible with the Linksys Linux kernel.
</p><p>
The default cramfs filesystem compresses data in 4K blocks, but compressing
on 4K boundaries limits the compression ratios that can be achieved. If
we could find a filesystem that compressed larger blocks of data but
mapped correctly to the page size in the OS, we would be able to
put far more data and applications in the firmware.
</p><p>
Phillip Lougher's squashfs filesystem compresses in 32K blocks and is
compatible with the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. If we could move the Linksys
firmware from cramfs to squashfs, we might have enough room for a VPN client
and server in the system.
</p><p>
The Linksys kernel is a customized 2.4.20 source tree modified by
Broadcom. Broadcom is a leading 802.11g chip maker and is responsible for
the CPU and radio chips in the WRT54G. The squashfs tar file contains
patches for the 2.4.20 through 2.4.22 kernels. Unfortunately, none of these
applies cleanly to the Broadcom kernel tree, so a bit of hand editing
is necessary. The patch with the fewest errors is the 2.4.22 version,
which misses only one hunk when applied. By reading the patch file and
finding the missing hunk, you can patch the missing code manually. You
also can find a WRT54G-specific squashfs patch on the Sveasoft Web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xec05d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Linksys WRT54G Source Tree</b></p><p>
When you unpack the GPL source from Linksys, a directory structure is created below the main
WRT54G subdirectory. Here is an explanation of
the important parts.
</p><p>
The main tarball directory is /WRT54G.
The main Makefile lives in /release/src. After unpacking
the source, read the README file here for instructions
on how to compile it.
</p><p>
All of the applications packaged with the Linksys unit
are built from /release/src/router. If you want to add applications, do
it here and modify the Makefile in this directory.
This Linux kernel source tree has been modified by
Broadcom, the manufacturer of the wireless chips and
CPU in the WRT54G. Add your kernel modifications or
patches here, /release/src/linux/linux.
</p><p>
You need to create a symlink from /opt to the brcm
directory here, /tools/brcm. Two of the subdirectories under brcm
must be added to your PATH. See the README file
above for more information.
</p><p>
Patches and updated source code can be downloaded
from Sveasoft. See Resources for
more information.
</p></div><p>
The next step is to edit the Broadcom kernel startup code and add a
check for squashfs. The do_mount.c file contains nearly identical code
and can be used as a guide when patching the startup.c file in the
arch/mips/brcm-boards/bcm947xx subdirectory.
</p><p>
After patching the kernel, the router Makefile must be patched to
generate a squashfs image and the Linux kernel configuration must be
set to include squashfs support.
</p><p>
This is well worth the effort, however. On recompile you should find some
500K free bytes, compared to the stock cramfs filesystem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0xec0a50"></a>
The Wireless Distribution System</h2></div></div><p>
The standard WRT54G is a wireless access point (AP). This means that it can
talk to wireless clients but not to other wireless access points. The
ability to link it to other access points using the Wireless Distribution
System (WDS) or to act as a wireless client is available using the
wl command.
</p><p>
The Wireless Distribution System is an IEEE specification that
allows wireless access points to be chained together in a wide area
network. Although there is some performance penalty for doing this,
the end result is an extended wireless network with a much greater range
than is available using single APs.
</p><p>
In order to link two APs together using WDS, their respective MAC
addresses must be known. Log in to each box and run the command
<tt  >wl wds
[<i>Mac Addr</i>]</tt>, using the MAC address of the opposite machine's wireless
interface. A new device called wds0.2 then appears on each box and can be
assigned an IP address. Once the IP addresses are assigned and routing is
set up between the two boxes, you are able to ping one from the other.
</p><p>
Each WDS link results in data traffic doubling within the network.
Because
802.11g is half duplex, this halves the network throughput. If the
APs are operating at 54MB/s, this is not much of a performance hit if
you keep the links to three or fewer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0x12b8f60"></a>
Client Mode Bridging</h2></div></div><p>
A simpler form of bridging is to set up one box as a client and have
it link to an access point. This is known as an Ethernet bridge, and
several products exist specifically for this purpose.
</p><p>
Client mode must be selected in the Linux kernel build menu and compiled
in the kernel. Once done, the kernel is built with a Broadcom
binary-only module that includes support for both AP and client modes.
The command <tt  >wl ap 0</tt> sets the box to client mode,
and <tt  >wl join [<i>SSID</i>]</tt>
links it to an access point. If you set routing in the client
using the access point's IP address as the default gateway, the client
automatically routes to the access point and your bridge becomes
active. Multiple AP and client pairs can be set up as an alternative to
the WDS method described above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc7580.0x12b91c8"></a>
The Power of Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
Linux has worked its way into everything from supercomputers to
embedded systems, including the Linksys. The move to Linux is the result of a
highest performance vs. lowest cost equation in a highly competitive
market. Many similar wireless routers, such as the Belkin F5D7230-4, the
Buffalotech WBR-G54 and the ASUS WL-300g and WL-500g, all use Linux in
their firmware, and the list expands daily. Unfortunately, none of these
companies has complied with GPL requirements and released the source
code. Legal issues aside, these products will lag far behind the Linksys
open-source products in capabilities and features for some time to come.
</p><p>
Linksys firmware builds containing amazing new features and capabilities
appear daily. At the time of this writing, firmware builds for the Linksys
WRT54G with support for VPNs, power adjustment, antenna select, client
and WDS mode, bandwidth management and a whole lot more are available
from multiple sources. The Internet combined with open-source code can
change a small SOHO wireless router into a powerful multifunctional device.
</p><p>
One word of caution: using experimental firmware could kill your box
and probably violates the Linksys warranty. If you are a casual user and
need home or small office access to a wireless network, this definitely
is not for you. Use the official Linksys firmware builds instead.
</p><p>
If, however, you are willing to risk your box and experiment with
its potential, you may find it is capable of much more than the
specifications listed on the product packaging&mdash;thanks to the power of Linux
and open-source development.
