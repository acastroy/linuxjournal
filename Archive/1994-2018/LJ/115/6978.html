This new project from the Naval
Undersea Warfare Center will test whether an
integrated 3-D display can give the commanding
officers of US submarines the ability to make
better decisions faster.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b34a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The US military has adopted the concept of network-centric (net-centric)
operations as a means to develop speed of command. Under this
methodology, speed of command has three parts: 1) the force achieves information superiority, having a dramatically
better awareness or understanding of the battlespace rather than simply
more raw data; 2) the forces acting with speed, precision and reach achieve the massing
of effects, not solely the massing of forces; and 3) the results that follow are the rapid foreclosure of enemy courses
of action and the shock of closely coupled events.
</p><p>
A significant issue in this concept pertains to the effectiveness
with which distributed military combat systems can be
integrated operationally to yield maximum battlespace awareness for the battle force.
Net-centric warfare requires a common operational/tactical picture;
that is, there must be a reliable and consistent common tactical picture
(CTP) across platforms to provide dominant battlespace awareness in the
multiwarfare environment.
</p><p>
The challenge in achieving speed of command is developing rapid,
accurate awareness and understanding of the entire battlespace.
Traditionally and currently, decision-makers develop a mental model of
the battlespace by assimilating data from multiple 2-D
displays and paper plots. A net-centric, or distributed, environment
demands a new approach for presentation of the battlespace&mdash;both in the
level of detail and in the manner in which it is presented.
</p><p>
The TALOSS system is designed to enable the rapid and/or accurate
assimilation of complex information in the undersea battlespace.
TALOSS is capable of generating a common undersea tactical picture,
which includes threat danger zone estimation, sensor contact tracking and
one's own ship's position and orientation presented in combination with
navigational/topographic/bathymetric information. It is hypothesized
that this integrated undersea picture can enable faster and more accurate
decision-making, as well as provide improved planning and decision aids.

General Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
TALOSS is compatible with and has been tested under Red Hat 7.0&ndash;9.0 as well as Slackware 9. Linux was chosen as the operating system for
several reasons: 1) it is compatible with current and future submarine
combat systems; 2) it is a generic UNIX operating system, which means
software and script files developed under Linux are transferred readily to
other UNIX operation systems, such as HP-UX and IRIX; and 3) it is an open-source operating system with a large user community that can be
tapped easily for system optimization and maintenance. TALOSS is comprised of
three main modules: the Feeder, the Bezel and the 3-D Display. Figure 1
is an architecture diagram of the baseline software.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6978f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Tactical Data Input</h2></div></div><p>
Feeder is a program that reads in and sends submarine Combat Control
System (CCS) data to the main display through TCP/IP sockets.
The program can be linked directly to the combat database, or it can run
reconstruction and demonstration data through ASCII input files. Feeder is
a flexible module that can be reconfigured easily to import multiple
databases. Because of this flexibility, the TALOSS system is compatible
with non-submarine-related applications, such as oceanographic/topographic
3-D maps, 3-D velocity fields and 3-D radar/sonar maps, as well other
applications involving objects moving in a 3-D environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b3a80"></a>
Simulation Control</h2></div></div><p>
The Bezel is an information/control GUI written using the Fast Light Tool
Kit (FLTK). It controls the 3-D main application (Main App) and, to a
limited extent, the Feeder program. In addition to its role as a system
controller, the Bezel also serves as a system status indicator. One way
it displays system status is through an Open Inventor 3-D window showing
the top-down view of the battlespace centered about one's own ship,
labeled ownship.
It is essentially a 2-D view of the 3-D scene giving the user an orientation
point into the 3-D scene from which to locate ownship's position
and orientation rapidly. The Bezel and the Main App communicate to each
other
through Shared Memory. Figure 2 shows a complete TALOSS display featuring
the FLTK control Bezel linked with the Open Inventor 3-D display.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6978f2.large.jpg"><img src="6978f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Complete TALOSS Display
</p></div></div><p>
In Figure 2, observe the pull-down menus at the top of the Bezel. They
allow the user access to basic TALOSS functions, such as exiting the
program, changing the view, changing the map color, changing the depth
regime limits and so forth. Similarly, located on the bottom of the Bezel are
two rows of toggle buttons that allow for the control of the tactical
information presented on the 3-D display of the undersea battlespace.
</p><p>
The right side of the Bezel is distinct from the top and bottom in
that its purpose is to provide pertinent tactical information, such as:
1) ownship, target and weapon information; 2) target and sensor
selection status; and 3) numeric target containment region information.
In addition, because the entire system is synchronized to a common
operational clock, whose time is given in the Navy daytime group (DTG)
format, that too is displayed on the top-right side of the Bezel.
Figure 3 shows a representative illustration of the right side of the
Bezel with corresponding feature description.

3-D Scene Manipulation</h2></div></div><p>
The 3-D undersea battlespace display receives its tactical information from
the Feeder program. It receives mapping and navigational information
from the Digital Nautical Chart database that is loaded at startup
and updated based on the evolution of the tactical situation. All
navigational information is pre-rendered as Open Inventor binary files,
called Navigation Tiles. The Main App combines all tactical and navigation
information into a comprehensive 3-D picture, rendering it using the
computer platform-independent scenegraph, Open Inventor.
</p><p>
The lower-left corner of the 3-D display contains three scene interaction
controls. The Rotx dolly rotates the scene about an imaginary x-axis
running horizontally across the screen. The Roty dolly rotates the
scene about an imaginary y-axis running vertically across the screen.
The vertical exaggeration slider bar changes the depth ratio of the scene.
This serves to exaggerate 3-D depth within the scene. To use any of these
dolly wheels, simply place the mouse cursor over the dolly, depress and
hold the left button while dragging the cursor in the desired direction.
The lower-right corner of the 3-D display contains a zoom dolly. Zoom-in
is limited to collision with the bottom, at which point zoom ceases.
</p><p>
In addition to scene manipulation devices, the 3-D display contains seven
interaction buttons. The buttons perform functions such as selecting
a contact, scene manipulation, resetting a home view and toggling a
wire-frame view.
</p><p>
Some other 3-D display features of note are a free-floating 3-D compass
that simultaneously indicates both direction and 3-D scene orientation
and a colorbar that indicates depth shading. Depth shading is a
combination of color map and depth regime selected. Figure 4 illustrates
these features.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6978f4.large.jpg"><img src="6978f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. 3-D Display Features
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b4370"></a>
Operation</h2></div></div><p>
The purpose of a tactical display is to give an operator a sense of
the location of everything relative to the operator's own position. This is
accomplished in TALOSS by a series of concentric range rings centered
about ownship. The range rings represent set intervals that allow an
operator to determine instantly, visually, how far any particular object
is from ownship. This information is particularly important in collision
avoidance and threat assessment. These rings are shown both in the 3-D
display and in the top-down view shown in the Bezel.
</p><p>
An essential component of any tactical or situational awareness display is
precise knowledge of location on the earth. TALOSS supports navigational
information using two methods. The first is a system of navigational grid
markers that are ten degrees of latitude and longitude. Because distance is
equal for all latitudes, this amounts to ten nautical miles for latitude.
Because the distance between longitude lines varies with latitude,
the number of nautical miles between longitude lines is dependent on
latitude. For temperate latitudes, it is approximately ten nautical miles.
Second, in addition to the lines of constant latitude/longitude,
an alphanumeric value appears on the 3-D map indicating latitude and
longitude. These values and the navigational grid lines are extracted
from the Digital Nautical Chart database. The navigation grid toggles
with the range ring display; however, the alphanumeric markers are
always displayed. Figure 5 shows a view of the 3-D display with all
navigational information enabled.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6978f5.large.jpg"><img src="6978f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Navigation and Tracking Information
</p></div></div><p>
The most important component of a situational awareness display is
the ability to track and to integrate all moving objects visually. In TALOSS, solid lines indicate the estimated tracks of all known objects.
Associated with the tracks is a color scheme indicating intent,
which can be hostile, friendly or neutral. The respective colors for these
classifications are red, blue and yellow. Because the current version of
TALOSS is designed for submarine applications, it also includes tracks
for weapons, both ownship's and hostile. The coloring scheme is green
for ownship's weapons and orange for hostile weapons. This color scheme,
however, is easily modified for other applications. Figure 5 illustrates
tracks on several contacts as well as ownship. All contacts
have their tracks labeled as defined in the contact window of the Bezel.
</p><p>
In addition to tracking information, TALOSS does bookkeeping for potential danger
zones as 3-D containment regions. The same color schemes used for tracks
apply to these containment regions: red, blue and yellow. Figure
6 indicates a typical 3-D containment region. Containment regions
are computed and displayed as complex volumetric shapes. Containment
region selection is controlled by the Bezel. The Bezel allows for both
containment region highlighting and selection of the contacts contributing
to a particular containment region.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6978f6.large.jpg"><img src="6978f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. 3-D Containment Region
</p></div></div><p>
Containment regions can be grown and intersected to mimic a vessel's
movement over time. Growth of the regions represents all possible
locations the vessel could occupy within the containment volume when
precise sensor contact on that vessel is lost. When a sensor update
on the vessel is obtained, that updated information, in the form of new
3-D containment volume, can be intersected with the previously grown
3-D volume to extract a much-reduced common volume (see Figure 7).
This common volume has the highest probability of containing the vessel of
interest. The goal of a military combat system is
to &ldquo;localize&rdquo;
the threat containment volume rapidly, so an appropriate tactical response can
be precipitated expeditiously. In other words, fight or flight.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6978f7.large.jpg"><img src="6978f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. 3-D Intersection Region
</p></div></div><p>
Pioneering software in the intersection of two or more noncontiguous
volumes has been developed for TALOSS by Arizona State University. One
of the main advantages of using the Linux operating system for software
development is that research into specific areas of interest
can be done inexpensively at universities or
other open-source sites. Using Linux means that the participating
research partners do not need to buy expensive development platforms, such
as Hewlett-Packard TAC or Silicon Graphics workstations. Instead, they
can develop code easily integrated into a combat system on inexpensive
Linux-based PC systems. The US government is encouraging the use
of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products for development and deployment
in the US military, both as a cost-saving measure and as a means for
ensuring widespread long-term support of the product. Using Linux as
both a development and operational environment for military systems is
a perfect example of COTS in action.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
A flexible, modularized, 3-D data fusion visualization system has
widespread applicability for both military and civilian applications.
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval
Undersea Warfare Center, located in Newport, Rhode Island, has created such
a system for the visualization and integration of the submarine undersea
battlespace. This system, TALOSS, has been designed to integrate a
wide variety of the databases, both civilian and military. Because the
software is modularized and written to run under
Linux, it has the potential for transition as
an open-source rendering and data fusion engine.
</p><p>
The ultimate aim of
the project, funding permitting, is to develop a completely modularized
TALOSS toolkit, unclassified portions of which will be made available for
civilian use as open-source software. There are two primary motivations
for this release: 1) the software was developed with public funds and
should be made available to the general public if national security
is not compromised, and 2) by making the unclassified portion of the
software available, it is hoped that improvements in its operation by the
Open Source community can be incorporated into the classified portion of
the software enhancing its operation.
