Visit the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, and
you'll get close enough to smell the machines that were the fastest
computers of their time.
Control Data Corporation's CDC 6600 and 7600, designed by Seymour Cray,
are two historic systems at the museum. If you go at the right time
you might even run into <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s Michael Baxter, who can explain
almost everything about Cray's designs except maybe the fake wood grain
on the 7600.
</p><p>
CDC products served their time in the US national laboratories and other
sites that buy the fastest machines, regardless of little details like
backward compatibility. When CDC tried to enter the business computing
market, it sank without a splash. Cray himself went on to found Cray
Research, but as long as there has been a computer hardware business,
high-performance computing (HPC) success has spelled failure in the
business computing market.
</p><p>
As we go to press, the latest hot system on order for a national lab is
the Lightning cluster from Linux NetworX, which will be put to work on
tasks vaguely described as having to do with &ldquo;safety and reliability of
the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile&rdquo; at Los Alamos.
</p><p>
Will Linux clusters stay in the HPC niche? Big vendors are putting
their money on &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Oracle is dropping UNIX boxes for cheap racks of
generic machines. Penguin Computing acquired Beowulf-originator Donald
Becker's cluster company, Scyld. Dell and IBM will sell you turnkey
clusters with service contracts&mdash;maybe not with one click from the
Web site, but close.
</p><p>
Linux supercomputers already wallow in the bargain basement of
price-performance, using technologies on the commodity market or
intended for the commodity market, such as x86 and AMD64 processors,
Gigabit Ethernet and Infiniband.
</p><p>
Martin Krzywinski and Yaron Butterfield give us an inspiring story of how
a lab with Linux infrastructure got the first sequence of the SARS virus,
under time pressure. Catch Linux bioinformatics
fever on page 44.
</p><p>
Back in the day, cluster managers had to write their own network drivers
and walk to the data center in the snow, but Steve Jones got help from
his cluster vendor in bringing up a TOP500-class cluster at Stanford
University (see page 72).
</p><p>
The more you learn about clusters, the more you might be tempted to
order a whole bunch of boxes and integrate them yourself. That could be
either the most money you ever saved or the biggest mistake you ever made.
Make your homebrew cluster a successful one by putting some sample nodes
through John Goebel's cluster hardware torture tests on page 62.

Finally, Reuven M. Lerner was a little late with his monthly column, thanks to a
huge blackout on the east coast of the US and Canada. Find out how to
prepare for one in his &ldquo;Server Migration and Disasters&rdquo; on
page 14.
