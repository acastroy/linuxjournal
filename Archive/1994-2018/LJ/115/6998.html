In the September 2003 issue, I ended a series on building
an OpenLDAP server. With this current column and the next, I discuss in-depth one
of LDAP's most compelling applications: providing authentication and
address book information for IMAP users. These aren't more LDAP
articles, though. The focus is on IMAP itself (Cyrus) and how it
can leverage LDAP and its own security features to provide secure remote
mail services. In other words, assume you already have (or
know how to get) an LDAP server running and populated with user accounts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x20763f8"></a>
Delivery vs. Transport Agents</h2></div></div><p>
First, a little background on IMAP's role in the e-mail food chain. IMAP,
the Internet Message Access Protocol (specified in RFC 3501), is a
protocol for mail delivery agents (MDAs). Whereas mail transport agents
(MTAs), such as Postfix and Sendmail, move mail between networks, MDAs move
mail from MTAs to destination mailboxes. To use a simile from my
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Secure Servers With Linux</em></span>, if an MTA is like a mail truck
that moves mail between post offices, an MDA is like a letter carrier
who delivers mail from the local post office to your house.
</p><p>
An IMAP-based MDA system has two parts: an IMAP server, which houses user
mailboxes and receives mail from some MTA, and a group of users running
IMAP client software. The three most popular open-source IMAP servers are
University of Washington IMAP (UW IMAP), Cyrus IMAP from Carnegie Mellon
University and Courier IMAP from Inter7 Internet Technologies. Popular
IMAP client applications include Netscape/Mozilla Communicator,
Ximian Evolution, Microsoft Outlook Express,
KMail, mutt, pine and Apple Mac OS X Mail. IMAP
clients are beyond the scope of our purposes here, but they're relatively
easy to configure and use. Furthermore, most IMAP clients interoperate
with most IMAP servers, so there isn't much to explain anyhow.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x20765b0"></a>
Which IMAP Server?</h2></div></div><p>
When building an IMAP system, the first choice an e-mail administrator
must make is which server to use. What are the major differences between
UW IMAP, Courier IMAP and Cyrus IMAP? Because features are added to the
latter two fairly frequently, I'm going to cop out of telling you the
answer in
much detail. What I can say is:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Of the three, UW IMAP is the least flexible, as it supports only
local-user-account mail file delivery; each local user's inbox is
stored as a single flat file, /var/mail/myusername. This has two
disadvantages: each mail user also must be a system user, and only
one process may write to any given user's inbox at any given time,
potentially resulting in file-locking complications.
</p></li><li><p>
Courier IMAP, actually part of the Courier Mail Server, was designed
to support qmail's maildir system. In it, users have their own
mail directories that store messages as individual files, which is
better both from a performance standpoint and for obviating file-locking
problems. Courier also can store mail in databases (see point 3);
recent versions of Courier IMAP also support LDAP authentication.
</p></li><li><p>
Cyrus IMAP can be more complicated to set up than UW IMAP or Courier
IMAP, mainly due to the Cyrus SASL authentication libraries on which
it depends. However, Cyrus IMAP uses its own user and mail databases, both
completely separate from the underlying OS, which allows you to add mail
users without adding system user accounts. Also, using databases rather
than flat files to store messages has an obvious performance benefit.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Personally, I've used Cyrus IMAP the most, so it is the MDA this article
discusses. Refer to the features lists on the respective home pages of UW
IMAP, Courier IMAP and Cyrus IMAP (see Resources) to decide
which is the best fit for your environment. If your choice is
different from mine, I hope some of the concepts in the rest of
this article still are helpful to you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x2076978"></a>
Getting and Installing Cyrus IMAP</h2></div></div><p>
As you know, I'm a big fan of binary packages due to the version control
and patch management features provided by a good package manager.
To my thinking, the major distributions' package managers all are quite
good. Accordingly, I recommend you install Cyrus IMAP from your
distribution's update service or installation media if at all possible.
You also need Cyrus SASL, an authentication back end
Cyrus IMAP requires. SMTP AUTH also uses this, so you already may have
it installed.
</p><p>
Thus, in SuSE 8.2 the RPMs you need are cyrus-imapd and cyrus-sasl2. In
Debian 3.0, you need the deb packages cyrus-common, cyrus-imapd,
libsasl2 and sasl2-bin. Both SuSE and Debian users should be aware that
earlier versions of your respective distributions may have Cyrus SASL
packages based on old (pre-v2.0) versions of Cyrus SASL. The method of
authenticating Cyrus IMAP against LDAP that I'm about to describe depends on
SASL v2.0 or later, however. If your distribution version
has a pre-2.0 SASL package, you may need to obtain and compile Cyrus
SASL source code (available at <a href="ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail" target="_self">ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail</a>).
</p><p>
For Red Hat 9.0, you have to do a little more work than you do for the
latest versions of SuSE or Debian, because Red Hat hasn't provided Cyrus IMAP
packages since Red Hat 7.1. You should install the RPMs cyrus-sasl,
cyrus-sasl-plain and cyrus-sasl-md5, which are part of the
standard Red Hat 9.0 distribution. But, you need
to get Cyrus IMAP itself in the form of an SRPM from <a href="http://home.teleport.ch/simix" target="_self">home.teleport.ch/simix</a>
(graciously maintained and provided by Simon Matter in Switzerland).
</p><p>
If you've never dealt with source RPM (SRPM) files before, don't worry:
the command to build a binary RPM from an SRPM is simply <tt  >rpm --rebuild
[--target <i>yourarch</i>]
<i>srpm.name.src.rpm</i></tt>, where
<i>srpm.name.src.rpm</i>
is the name of your SRPM file, and <i>yourarch</i> is your machine's
architecture (such as i386, i586, i686). For example, when I ran this
command on my Pentium III server I used <tt  >rpm --rebuild --target
i686 cyrus-imapd-2.1.12-7.src.rpm</tt>. Although the --target
setting is optional, if you're going to have a large IMAP user database,
optimizing Cyrus IMAP for your CPU type reportedly yields noticeable
speed improvements over the default i386 build.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> then automatically compiles several new binary RPMs, customized
for your local system architecture. These RPMs are written
into /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ (the precise subdirectory being whatever
you specified after <tt  >--target</tt> or i386/ by default). These RPMs are
cyrus-imapd, cyrus-imapd-utils, cyrus-imapd-devel and perl-Cyrus. Install
them with the <tt  >rpm -Uvh <i>filenames</i></tt> command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x2077000"></a>
Configuring SASL</h2></div></div><p>
We have two goals for the remainder of this article: to leverage our
existing LDAP server to authenticate IMAP users and to configure
our Cyrus IMAP server to accept only SSL-encrypted connections from
end users. In past articles, I've extolled the virtues of centralizing
authentication, so hopefully the value of using LDAP for this step is a given
by now. I may have explained in earlier columns how dangerous
clear-text e-mail retrieval is. In normal POP3 and IMAP
transactions, your user name, password and all subsequent e-mail data
traverse the network unencrypted. Therefore, they are exposed to eavesdropping attacks,
especially if you retrieve your e-mail over a wireless network or from the
Internet, the largest untrusted network of them all.
</p><p>
Back to SASL. Because Cyrus IMAP and Cyrus SASL both come from
Carnegie Mellon University, and because the Cyrus team is understandably
reluctant to reinvent the wheel, Cyrus IMAP depends on Cyrus SASL for its
authentication functionality. This may seem confusing: isn't this function what
we're using LDAP for? Yes it is, and SASL is indeed redundant
insofar as SASL was designed to use <span   class="emphasis"><em>its own</em></span> user database to
authenticate users.
</p><p>
Besides using its own database, however, SASL also can be used to broker
authentication transactions with other authentication sources, such as
PAM or LDAP. The simplest way to do this is by configuring saslauthd,
the SASL authentication d&aelig;mon, whose behavior is controlled primarily
by the file /etc/saslauthd.conf. Listing 1 shows a sample saslauthd.conf
file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x2077210"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Sample /etc/saslauthd.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
ldap_servers: ldap://localhost/
ldap_search_base: dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org
ldap_bind_dn: cn=servers,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org
ldap_bind_pw: <i>password_goes_here</i>
</pre></div><p>
ldap_servers specifies a space-delimited list of LDAP server URIs. In
Listing 1, I've specified a clear-text LDAP connection to the local LDAP
process. I instead could specify the encrypted ldaps protocol instead
of ldap, a remote fully qualified domain name or IP address
instead of localhost or both, as in ldaps://ldap.wiremonkeys.org.
</p><p>
ldap_search_base is the base (shared) part of your users' distinguished
names (DNs). ldap_bind_dn and ldap_bind_pw are the DN and password you wish
saslauthd to use to connect to your LDAP server. I recommend creating a
special LDAP record for this purpose. In Listing 1, servers is the name of
a special LDAP account with an objectClass of simpleSecurity Object, which
means that besides its DN and objectClass, it has only one other attribute,
userPassword.
</p><p>
If nothing else, having a dedicated server account in LDAP means that in
your LDAP logs you can distinguish LDAP lookups by back-end processes and
servers from end-user-initiated queries. This would be harder if IMAP used,
for example, your personal LDAP account. For
still more granular auditing, you even could use a different LDAP account
for each service that performs LDAP queries, for example, cyrus and
postfix.
</p><p>
Those are the options I use in my own /etc/saslauthd.conf file, but they
aren't the only ones available to you. Cyrus SASL is distributed with
a file, LDAP_SASLAUTHD, that documents these and other saslauthd.conf
options. It's located in the source code distribution's saslauthd
directory, but if you install SASL from a binary package, this file is
placed wherever your distribution puts package documentation, probably some
subdirectory of /usr/share/doc.
</p><p>
Besides editing /etc/saslauthd.conf, you also need to make sure
saslauthd is started with the -a ldap option. On Red Hat, this is done by
editing the file /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd so the parameter MECH
is set to ldap. On SuSE, you edit the same file, but the parameter is
called SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH. Other distributions using sysconfig may
have a different parameter name, and/or you may need to customize
/etc/saslauthd. Again, the desired end result is for saslauthd to be
passed the option -a ldap on startup.
</p><p>
Once you've configured and restarted saslauthd, you're ready to configure
your IMAP service. As it happens, this is the easy part.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x2077688"></a>
Configuring Cyrus IMAP</h2></div></div><p>
Most of Cyrus IMAP's behavior is controlled by a file named, predictably,
/etc/imapd.conf. Listing 2 shows a sample imapd.conf file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7e580.0x2077790"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Example /etc/imapd.conf File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
configdirectory: /var/lib/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: cyrus wongfh
sievedir: /var/lib/imap/sieve
sendmail: /usr/sbin/sendmail
hashimapspool: true
sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
tls_cert_file: /var/lib/imap/slapd3.pem
tls_key_file: /var/lib/imap/slapd3key.pem
tls_cipher_list: HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, many of the options in imapd.conf simply define paths to
various things Cyrus IMAP needs. I won't cover these in detail (see the
imapd.conf(5) man page for complete documentation), but let's at least discuss
the nondefault settings in Listing 2.
</p><p>
admins: specifies the Cyrus IMAP users who may administer the IMAP
system using the cyradm tool. (We'll cover cyradm in a future column.) By setting
sasl_pwcheck_method: to saslauthd and by already having configured
saslauthd to use LDAP, we've configured Cyrus IMAP to use LDAP for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> authentication. So even though, for example, the user cyrus
may exist on the local Linux system (in /etc/passwd), cyrus
also needs to have an LDAP entry. When you run cyradmin and are
prompted for cyrus' password, provide the password defined for
Cyrus in the database, not cyrus' Linux password, if indeed the Linux
account has one. In other words, any account names you specify
after admins: must exist on whatever user database is specified by
sasl_pwcheck_method.
</p><p>
When you installed Cyrus IMAP, whether from binary packages or from
source code, a new user (cyrus) should have been created and given
ownership of most Cyrus IMAP files. As with any other good service d&aelig;mon,
Cyrus IMAP runs as a special nonprivileged user rather than root most
of the time.
</p><p>
The three other settings in Listing 2 that I had to customize were
tls_cert_file:, tls_key_file: and tls_cipher_list:. These
are analogous to OpenLDAP's slapd.conf parameters TLSCertificateFile,
TLSCertificateKeyFile and TLSCipherSuite, respectively. I mention this
because the certificate/key files specified here are the same ones I
used for OpenLDAP on this system. I did this because, in my example scenario,
I'm running Cyrus IMAP on the same server on which I'm running OpenLDAP;
there's no reason to use different server certificates and keys for
each service. I did, however, copy both files from /etc/openldap to
/var/lib/imap to simplify ownership/permissions management.
</p><p>
If my LDAP service was running on a separate host, I would create
a new TLS certificate/key pair for my LDAP server, using exactly the
same procedure I described in my August 2003 column:

<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out slapdcert.pem \
-keyout slapdkey.pem -days 365
</pre>
</p><p>
Regardless, remember to make both your certificate
and key file owned by cyrus and your key file readable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
by its owner.
</p><p>
If you install Cyrus IMAP from source, it uses default
SSL keys that fail if an IMAP client attempts to connect using TLS
rather than SSL encryption. Aside from the reliability issue, it's never,
ever a good idea to use default (placeholder) certificates or keys for
anything. Either leverage a server certificate/key you've created already
(if applicable) or create a new pair. Your IMAP server will be both
more reliable and more secure.
</p><p>
That's it; Cyrus IMAP now can be restarted (<tt  >/etc/init.d/cyrus-imapd
restart</tt>) and users added with cyradm. We'll have to save that part,
plus getting your local MTA to deliver mail to IMAP, for next time.
