Every site is different and needs
an individual disaster plan. Develop your own
disaster plan with some rules for recovering from
catastrophic failures.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x19852f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Experience counts for quite a bit in the world of
system administration. Sysadmins
scarred by bad hardware, devastating software
problems and security break-ins are more likely
to put together effective backup strategies,
security policies and disaster recovery plans.
The question is not whether a disaster will happen
to your servers but when the disaster will
occur and what form it will take.
</p><p>
I'm writing this in mid-August 2003, less than one week after I moved my own
server (lerner.co.il) to a new virtual co-location facility. And, much
of this column was written in blacked-out New York City, where I was
planning to spend several hours at business meetings&mdash;and ended up
getting to experience firsthand a large-scale technological disaster.
Oh, and when I wasn't moving my server or sitting in the dark, I was
without Internet connectivity for the better part of a week, as I was moving
to a new apartment in Chicago.
</p><p>
So this month, we take a brief pause from our discussion of Bricolage
and other content management software and instead consider how to handle server
migrations and disaster plans for Web/database sites. Of course, every
site and server is different and deserves to be given individual
attention for the best possible planning. But with a little forethought,
it shouldn't be too difficult to move your server from one location to
another, to handle catastrophic hardware or software failure or even
to run in the face of large-scale disaster, as the entire northeastern
United States experienced this summer.

Server Relocation</h2></div></div><p>
I have moved my server several times over the last few years, and each
experience has gone more smoothly than its predecessor. To be
honest, moving to a new machine does not need to be difficult or
painful, but it does need to be planned carefully. Every step needs to be
taken with the assumption that you will need to roll it back at some
point.
</p><p>
The simplest possible type of server to move from one machine to another
is a static Web site or one that uses basic CGI programs. In such cases,
you need to ask only a few questions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Does the Apache configuration include the modules that you use? If
you are a heavy user of mod_rewrite or if you enjoy the benefits of
mod_speling (yes, with one l), you should double-check to ensure
that these modules are available. If they were compiled into your
server statically, running <tt  >httpd -l</tt> lists them. If they were
compiled as dynamic modules (DSOs), however, you should check in
the libexec subdirectory of your Apache installation, where available
DSOs are placed. Each DSO can be loaded optionally by including an
appropriate LoadModule directive in the Apache configuration file.
</p></li><li><p>
Under what user and group does Apache run? System administrators
have different opinions regarding the user and group IDs under which
Apache should run. Some use the default, running it as the nobody
user. Others (like me) prefer to create a special Apache user and
group, adding users into the apache group as necessary. Still
others use the suexec functionality in Apache, compiling it such
that it can run as one or more users. In any case, be
sure your chosen Apache user/group configuration on your new
server is set up in /etc/passwd and /etc/group, as well as in Apache's
own config files.
</p></li><li><p>
Where is the DocumentRoot? By default, Apache assumes that
DocumentRoot is in /usr/local/apache/htdocs. This default, which
can be changed with the DocumentRoot directive in the Apache
configuration file, depends on the operating system or distribution
you are
running. If you are using an RPM version of Apache, as is the case
with Red Hat-style distributions, the DocumentRoot might be in
/var/www or in another directory altogether. This should not affect
the URLs within your programs and documents, but you should
double-check the directory into which you're copying the files
before assuming that the destination is the right place.
</p></li><li><p>
On what languages and modules do your CGI programs depend? If your
site uses CGI programs, then at least one of those programs probably
depends on an external module or library of some sort. CGI.pm, the
Perl module for CGI programs, has been included in Perl
distributions for a number of years, but it continues to be
updated on a regular basis. So, if you depend on features from the
latest version, you must double-check. This goes for other
modules that you use; one client of mine was using an old version of
Perl's Storable module and discovered (the hard way) that upgrading
to the latest version broke compatibility when communicating with
legacy systems.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x1985a28"></a>DNS</h2></div></div><p>
The linchpin of any server migration is the process of moving DNS records.
Although people prefer to use names, such as www.lerner.co.il, network
connections use numeric IP addresses, such as 69.55.225.93.
Translating the human-readable names into computer-usable numbers is
the role of DNS, the Domain Name System. Intelligent manipulation of
DNS records is a critical part of any server transfer.
</p><p>
The main problem with DNS is not host-to-IP translation but,
rather, the fact that DNS results are cached. After all, you want to
avoid a DNS request to your server for each HTTP request that someone
makes. Such requests would place undue load on your server and would
unnecessarily delay the servicing of HTTP requests.
</p><p>
So when you make a DNS request, you're not actually asking the
original, authoritative server for an answer. Rather, you're asking
your local DNS server for an answer. If it can provide one
from its cache of recent results, it will do so without turning
to the main server. In other words, <tt  >nslookup
www.lerner.co.il</tt>
executes a DNS request against your ISP's DNS server. That server
might return a result from its cache, or it might turn to the
authoritative server for the lerner.co.il domain.
</p><p>
When you move a server from one machine to another, then, you want to
reduce the TTL (time to live) setting on the DNS server to a
low number, so that DNS servers caching this information
do not return false answers. I've found that reducing the TTL to
300 seconds (five minutes) is more than adequate. Once the system
has been migrated completely, you can increase the TTL to a more typical
value, such as six hours, to reduce the load on your DNS servers.
</p><p>
If you are moving your HTTP server from one provider to another,
here is an outline of what you can do to have a successful migration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Make sure a DNS server at your new provider is able and willing
to serve DNS (forward and backward) with your current IP addresses
and hostnames. That is, the DNS server at your new provider should
point people to your old provider. Set the TTL to five minutes.
</p></li><li><p>
Update the WHOIS records for your domain, indicating that your new
provider is the authoritative DNS server. It may take one or two days for
this to filter through the entire DNS system. If your new DNS
server is providing results identical to your old one, the only
ways to tell if things have worked are to perform a WHOIS lookup
or to use <tt  >nslookup -type=ns yourdomain.com</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the WHOIS records have been updated, start moving things
over. Make sure that all of the software you need is configured
correctly, that all modules are set correctly and that the DNS
servers have been updated. If your new DNS server isn't
responding to queries for your domain, you will be in deep trouble
when the WHOIS records point to the new server as an authority.
</p></li><li><p>
When everything seems to be identical (running rsync from the
old system to the new one is a good way to ensure that it is),
switch the DNS definitions such that the hostname resolves to the
new IP address, rather than to the old one.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Depending on the type of server you're running, you might want to
turn off the HTTP server on the old system to reduce some of the
confusion that might occur as a result of the switchover. For
example, switching off the old HTTP server before you switch DNS
ensures that the log files do not have any overlap, allowing
you to append them together and use Webalizer or Analog to look
around appropriately.
</p><p>
At this stage, everything should be working correctly on the new
system. But, you should check as many links as possible,
particularly those that invoke CGI programs, server-side includes and
nonstandard modules or those that require unusual permissions. As always, your
HTTP server's error log is your best friend during this process; if and when things
go wrong, you can consult the error log to see what is
happening.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x1986108"></a>
Databases</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, all of the above assumes that you're working on a
relatively simple site. Most modern Web sites, however, include relational
databases somewhere in the mix for a variety of reasons. They are used for
consistency and flexibility, as well as for development speed and the
incorporation of a commonly used paradigm that's easy to debug and
use.
</p><p>
Relational databases store information in one or more tables, commonly
grouped into a database. (Yes, it's somewhat confusing to say that
a database server contains one or more databases, each of which in
turn contains one or more tables, but that's the way it is.) To move
a database from one system to another, you need to move both the
database schema (the table, view and function definitions) and
the data itself. Of course, a database typically is owned by
a particular database user (who generally is not the same as a UNIX
user) and has specific permissions set on it.
</p><p>
If your Web site incorporates a database, you thus need to move
that database from the old system to the new one, including all of the
owner- and permissions-related information. How you do this
depends on the database you're using and if any tricks
are involved.
</p><p>
MySQL databases that use ISAM/MyISAM tables (the default and still
the most popular option) simply can be copied from one MySQL system to
another. Typically, all of the files associated with a database are
in a directory with the name of the database under /var/lib/mysql.
You thus can copy the foo database by copying the directory
/var/lib/mysql/foo, including any files it might contain, into
/var/lib/mysql/foo on the new system. (Be sure
the database is shut before performing this operation.) Start up the
server on the new system, and it should work fine.
</p><p>
Things aren't quite this easy with PostgreSQL, which keeps track of
database schemas and data in a low-level binary format. Using tar or
rsync to copy a PostgreSQL database is highly unlikely to work&mdash;and
if it does work, it probably involves massive data
corruption and might even crash the back-end database server.
Instead, you should use the pg_dump tool, which allows you to turn a
PostgreSQL database into a set of CREATE, INSERT and COPY statements
in plain-text format. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pg_dump -U mydb mydb &gt; /tmp/mydb-dump.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x19863c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The <tt  >-U mydb</tt> portion indicates that we want to use the mydb database user.
You might need to substitute a different user name. You then
can put this dumped output into a working database with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ createdb -U mydb mydb2
$ psql -U mydb mydb2 &lt; /tmp/mydb-dump.txt

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x1986580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Following these two commands, two databases (mydb and
mydb2) are available, both owned by the mydb user.
</p><p>
MySQL makes it easy to handle such situations because of its built-in
master/slave system. One database can be the master, accepting all
SQL commands and queries, and another can follow along, allowing you
to replace the master with the slave in case of catastrophic
failure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188d580.0x19866e0"></a>
In Case of Blackout...</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, I was &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; enough to be in New York City
during the massive power outage that affected millions of people in
the United States and Canada this past August. Ironically, the outage occurred about
an hour after I toured a potential client's server farm, where he
demonstrated how his company backs up all its data to a remote location in
Connecticut. (After all, what are the odds of something affecting
both New York City and Connecticut? At least, that's what I was
thinking while nodding in approval an hour before the blackout.)
</p><p>
If you're like me, the blackout didn't affect your servers, which
are located outside of New York. And most co-location facilities have
backup generators that can handle most or all of the facility's power
needs in case of an emergency.
</p><p>
But, if your servers are located in your office or if you use only a
simple UPS to ensure they continue running, the servers
probably would be unavailable during a blackout like the one that we saw in
mid-August, which lasted more than 48 hours in some parts of the
Northeast. If your server is critical to your business, you
might seriously want to consider moving it to a co-location facility.
</p><p>
But even co-located servers crash and go off-line; I can tell you this
from personal experience over the past few years. This means that if
you depend on your server, you should be backing it up on a regular
basis. Moreover, you should be migrating it continuously to a server
at another physical location, preferably hosted by a different
company. But the differences should stop there&mdash;you want the
software configurations to be as similar as possible. If you use
rsync for all of the HTML pages, templates, software libraries and
CGI programs on your server, and similarly automate a database dump
and restore on the second server, the second server should be a
close-to-exact replica of the first and should be available to go live
at a moment's notice.
</p><p>
You even can go one step further and use both servers
simultaneously. Of course, this is a far more difficult task, as
it requires you either to use a single database server (creating a
single point of failure) or to synchronize the databases at frequent
intervals. But it's definitely possible, particularly on
sites that are largely static, as we know from the success of
Akamai, which has a hugely redundant array of servers all over the
world. The more static the site, the easier it is to replicate and
keep up and running.
</p><p>
This is still one advantage that commercial database software, such as
Oracle, has over PostgreSQL and MySQL. Although the latter offer
master/slave replication to varying degrees, the synchronization is
neither as advanced nor as robust as what Oracle offers. Over time,
however, I expect this situation will change, as such architectures grow
increasingly common.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Moving to a new place is hard, and moving your server to a new
location or computer also is hard. But by coming up with a good
migration plan, moving incrementally and checking your work at every
point with tools such as nslookup, dig, telnet and the HEAD and GET
programs that come with Perl's LWP (or the curl toolkit that
performs similar operations), you can have a smooth and simple
migration.
</p><p>
With only a few changes, a migration plan also can be used as a backup
plan, ensuring that your servers continue to work and are
accessible even in the wake of a great disaster. You cannot
plan for every potential pitfall, but if your organization depends on
its Web site, it's worth investing the time and money to ensure
that it remains on-line.
