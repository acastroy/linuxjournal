Local broadcast channels on Roku? Yes!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0xcdd358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I talked about various streaming options available for folks
who want to get rid of their cable bills. You might remember that although
I found lots of options, I hadn't actually canceled my cable service
because I couldn't get local channels. Since writing that article, I did in
fact cancel my subscription and managed to get local channels anyway. But,
it wasn't as easy as putting rabbit ears on my television, that's for
sure! If getting those local channels is something you're interested in
doing, but struggle with the logistics, I encourage you to read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0xcdd510"></a>
Finding Towers</h2></div></div><p>
Figuring out what channels are available in your area can be the most
difficult part of cutting the cable cord. Thankfully, with the advent
of digital TV, several wonderful websites and apps were created that
can help you determine your free TV potential. It's interesting that not all
websites agree on signal strength. If you recall, as I wrote in my last article, I was
certain I couldn't tune in any channels. That certainty was based on
reports from several websites. Thankfully though, I expanded the search and
decided to try it anyway. And, I currently get all the major stations
even though I expected to get none!
</p><p>
Before we moved to the city of Petoskey, Michigan, we were in a rural area 30 miles
east. Our house was in a valley, but thanks to AntennaWeb (<a href="http://antennaweb.org" target="_self">antennaweb.org</a>), I was
able to determine that we could get stations with an antenna on a mast
(Figure 1).
So when we moved to our new house, I used the same website, and it
informed me that we'd be able to get zero channels (Figure 2), regardless of what
sort of antenna we used. That's when I gave up&mdash;at least temporarily. I
tried another website, TV Fool (<a href="http://www.tvfool.com" target="_self">www.tvfool.com</a>), and was surprised to see quite
a few channels that were available, but just were weak (Figure 3). My suspicion
is that AntennaWeb cuts off the stations that are really weak. Still,
I'd like to know what's available.

</p></div></div><p>
In the end, I found a few apps in the Google Play Store
that were incredibly useful. Not only do the apps locate
nearby towers, but if your phone has a compass built in, it
helps you point your antenna for pinpoint accuracy. 
Several apps are available, but I use Digital TV Antennas (Figure 4):
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.com.lichtmaier.antenas" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.com.lichtmaier.antenas</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12165f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. These apps make pointing antennas so much easier.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0xcddeb0"></a>
Choosing Antennas</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've determined which towers you want to try, you can choose the
antenna (or antennas) you want to use. If AntennaWeb shows you available
towers, it also shows you the &ldquo;color&rdquo; antenna you'll need to tune in the
various channels. Those ratings are standard, so you can look for a
&ldquo;blue&rdquo;
or &ldquo;green&rdquo; antenna and have a fairly good estimate of what stations you'll
get. My towers are &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; at best, so I needed to get the biggest, baddest
antenna I could get. I also needed a preamp (more about that in a bit).
</p><p>
If you're in an area with strong signals, you will likely be able to use
an omnidirectional antenna to tune in towers from all directions. In fact,
many people do really well with rabbit ears, especially if they're in a
city near a television tower. If you need to pull a station from a long
distance, however, you'll need a directional antenna. And, even those
antennas come
in multiple flavors, and they all have various strengths and weaknesses.
</p><p>
Before you pick an antenna, you have to determine what type of signal you
need to receive. The spectrum is divided into three parts: Low VHF, High VHF
and UHF. Those translate into channels 2&ndash;6 for Low VHF, channels
7&ndash;13 for
High VHF and 14&ndash;51 (used to be 69) for UHF. The majority of antennas do a
poor job with Low VHF, because the wavelengths require huge antenna booms
to receive. If you need to pull in a Low VHF channel, be sure that whatever
antenna you end up buying is designed for Low VHF. The good news is more
and more stations are moving away from Low VHF, but it's often hard to
tell without looking at sites like TV Fool or AntennaWeb, because stations
will use &ldquo;virtual channels&rdquo; to preserve their station
identification.
</p><p>
If you're a television station that has been &ldquo;NBC on channel 2&rdquo; for
50 years, that channel recognition is hard to give up. So those
stations end up switching to a UHF frequency, but encoding a
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; channel so the television shows its original branded channel
number. If you look back at Figure 3, you'll see that channel 35 has a virtual
channel of 4.1. When you switch channels on your television, it will
actually show the station on channel 4, even though it's actually being
broadcast on UHF channel 35! It's confusing, yes, but it's honestly a good
thing, because it means fewer and fewer stations actually require a Low VHF
antenna. In fact, every single station available to me is a UHF station,
so I can get a UHF-only antenna.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0xcde380"></a>
Antenna Angle</h2></div></div><p>
If you need a Low VHF channel, or even a High VHF channel, your options
are a bit more limited. In fact, you'll likely want to get a traditional
television antenna like the Channel Master 3020 (<a href="http://a.co/83uaKeY" target="_self">a.co/83uaKeY</a>), 
which is around 15-feet long and 8-feet wide! Obviously I'm going to the
extreme size, and if you don't need to pull in weak stations, you can
get away with something smaller. With an antenna this big, an outdoor
roof installation makes sense, but I've installed something similar in
my attic (Figure 5) and had fairly good luck. Unfortunately, this style of
antenna is fairly directional, so they work best if your towers are in the
same direction. They can certainly pull a bit of signal from towers not
directly in front of them, but they do best while pointed at the tower,
especially VHF towers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12165f5.large.jpg"><img src="12165f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. This photo doesn't do the size of the antenna justice. It's enormous!
</p></div></div><p>
Using the Android app mentioned previously, pointing an antenna like this
is trivial. If you're trying to find a sweet spot between two towers,
however, the best thing to do is connect a television and make minor
adjustments until you get the most stations to come in clearly. Keep in
mind that weather affects reception, so a station that comes in clearly
one day might not come in at all on another day. It can be frustrating. I've
taken far too many trips to my attic attempting to get the best compromise
between quality and quantity of stations!
</p><p>
If you just need UHF channels, I highly recommend getting a bow tie
antenna. Like the traditional-shaped antenna, they can be mounted
indoors or outside, but they are more affected by wind than traditional
antennas. Bow tie antennas often are worth the hassle, however, because
they do an incredible job with UHF channels, plus they have a wider area
of reception. Every antenna is rated for a different angle of reception,
but if you have a few towers that a unidirectional antenna can't get at the
same time, a bow tie might work better. Unfortunately, the math
goes only so far, and you'll likely have to try various models to find
the best match. I ordered the HD4228 antenna (<a href="http://a.co/5qPRjcm" target="_self">a.co/5qPRjcm</a>),
hoping it will pick up multiple towers a bit better than my traditional
directional antenna (Figure 6). I recommend unwrapping antennas carefully, because
it's possible you'll need to return them when they don't work like you
hope. I didn't do that, and I now have three antennas I can no longer
return.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12165f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. This antenna hasn't arrived yet, but I have high hopes.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0xcde9b0"></a>
Amp? Preamp?</h2></div></div><p>
If you go to a department store, you'll likely see lots of amplified
antennas, which are marketed as magic bullets to enhance even the
weakest signal. That's not what amps do for television signal. Also,
note that &ldquo;amp&rdquo; and &ldquo;preamp&rdquo; are the same thing when it comes to television
antennas. (There might be a technical difference an RF pro can explain,
but for all intents and purposes, &ldquo;amp&rdquo; and
&ldquo;preamp&rdquo; both mean preamp
when it comes to television antennas.)
</p><p>
A preamp does not make a weak signal stronger. If your antenna
doesn't tune in the station, an amp won't help. What a preamp does
help with is eliminating signal loss on the way from the antenna to the
television. That's why preamps are installed as close to the antenna as
possible&mdash;usually directly on the mast. The preamp takes the signal from
the antenna and strengthens the signal on your in-house coax cable. Think
about it like tuning in a radio station with an antenna and having an amp to
make the
volume louder. It's the same process. The amp makes the signal
&ldquo;louder&rdquo;,
so all the televisions in the house can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; the signal, but it does
not make the signal any clearer.
</p><p>
Just because preamps aren't the magic-bullet antennas marketing folks would
like us to believe, they are still a vital part of retrieving a weak
signal. Every connector, splitter and foot of cable introduces signal
loss into the system. A preamp guarantees every bit of reception gets
to the television tuners, and with fringe towers, it can make all the
difference. Thankfully, preamps are relatively inexpensive and easy
to install. I use the Wineguard LNA-200 (<a href="http://a.co/2xCR5rn" target="_self">a.co/2xCR5rn</a>,
Figure 7),
which is powered by an injector (Figure 8) in the cable before connecting
to televisions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12165f7.large.jpg"><img src="12165f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Multiple Antennas?</h2></div></div><p>
If you have towers that are in different directions, it's possible
to point two directional antennas and combine the signal to get
both. Logically, this makes a ton of sense, especially if you have
towers that are impossible to get with a single antenna. Unfortunately,
it seldom works in practice. The problem is that along with combining
reception, it also combines interference and noise. The end result is
usually channels that have a ghosting effect, and instead of getting
both towers, you end up with neither.
</p><p>
If you want to try using multiple antennas, be sure to get the smallest
directional antennas you can use and still get a signal. The idea is
to tune in only the tower you're pointing at, so the interference is
limited. Still, it's a long shot and seldom works. There are additional
steps you can do like installing channel filters so only specific
frequencies come through to the antenna combiner, but it becomes complicated
and expensive very quickly. I've never had luck with multiple antennas,
but some people do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe5580.0x10d75a0"></a>
Seven Televisions?</h2></div></div><p>
There are seven televisions in my house: one in each bedroom, one in my
office, one in the upstairs family room and one in the living room. I
have Ethernet or Wi-Fi to each TV, but only one has COAX. I have
no desire to run COAX cables and enough preamps to get television signal
to each room. So for me, there has to be another step to cutting the
cord&mdash;namely, network distribution of television channels. Thankfully,
a few options work really well.
</p><p>
The Tablo DVR (<a href="http://a.co/7bmdB5q" target="_self">a.co/7bmdB5q</a>) is a device that has built-in
tuners for watching and recording OTA (over the air) television (Figure 9). It
requires an external hard drive and a subscription for TV guide
information. Some apps make watching television easy on devices
like the Roku, but paying for a subscription feels a bit like cable television
fees. The system is reported to work well, however, so if you're looking
for a DVR option, it's worth looking at. I want my local stations
only for watching the news and the Thanksgiving Day Parade, so DVR isn't
really high on my priority list, so I chose to install an HDHomeRun
CONNECT device.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12165f9.large.jpg"><img src="12165f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. I've heard good things about the Tablo, just not the price.
</p></div></div><p>
The HDHomeRun CONNECT (Figure 10) has two built-in tuners and nothing else. It
connects to Ethernet and acts like a network-based television tuner for
any device that can connect to it. There are computer apps for watching
television, but the real awesomeness comes when you use something like
Plex Media Server. Plex DVR supports the HDHomeRun as a tuner, so you
can use the DVR feature of Plex. Unfortunately, Plex DVR doesn't allow
you to watch live television, just recordings after the shows are done.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12165f10.large.jpg"><img src="12165f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. I love the HDHomeRun, but I wish it had more than two tuners.
</p></div></div><p>
Plex has two channels that let you
watch live television from any Plex device (Figure 11)&mdash;that includes
remote mobile devices! This means I can watch my local television
stations even while traveling. That's awesome. Neither channel
is &ldquo;official&rdquo;, but each easily can be installed on the Plex Media
Server. HDGrandSlam (<a href="https://github.com/jumpmanjay/HDGrandSlam.bundle" target="_self">https://github.com/jumpmanjay/HDGrandSlam.bundle</a>)
has a more complex menu system, but it detects what shows are currently
playing on your OTA channels. The other channel is HDHR Viewer 2
(<a href="https://github.com/zynine-/HDHRViewerV2.bundle" target="_self">https://github.com/zynine-/HDHRViewerV2.bundle</a>), which has a simpler menu
system, but other than that, it's similar in function. I installed both,
but I find myself using HDHR Viewer 2 more often simply because it's fewer
clicks to get to the television. It's interesting to note that both channels take a
significant time to start playing the station. I think that's due to
transcoding and buffering. It's tolerable, but just know that channel surfing
isn't fun.

Am I a Happy Cord-Cutter?</h2></div></div><p>
If there was a magic bullet that made cord-cutting possible for me,
it would be Roku. I have a few Roku TVs and some non-smart TVs with
Roku devices connected to them. Roku allows me to use PlayStation Vue,
Plex, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and live TV (via Plex), with the option to
switch to SlingTV if Vue ever becomes too expensive. If my family members had
to switch sources every time they switched from television to Netflix,
it would be frustrating. Heck, the newer Roku boxes even have HDMI-CEC,
which allows volume to be controlled with a single remote, which means
no more piles of remotes for each room.
</p><p>
I've used just about every home theater set-top-box device around,
from the original Xbox running XBMC, to a Raspberry Pi running Kodi,
to the Boxee Box and Popcorn Hour. With a Roku, a Linux server and a
bit of elbow grease, I've finally gotten to the point where watching
television doesn't require any special tech skills. Heck, I even
can turn the television on and off with my Amazon Echo&mdash;but that's another
article altogether.
