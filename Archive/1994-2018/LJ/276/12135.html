How can we reliably update embedded Linux?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bd580.0x16b5250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Mirai botnet attack that enslaved poorly secured connected embedded
devices is yet another tangible example of the importance of security
before bringing your embedded devices online. A new strain of Mirai has
caused network outages to about a million Deutsche Telekom customers due
to poorly secured routers. Many of these embedded devices run a variant
of embedded Linux; typically, the distribution size is around 16MB today.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the Linux kernel, although very widely used, is far from
immune to critical security vulnerabilities as well. In fact, in a
presentation at Linux Security Summit 2016, Kees Cook highlighted two
examples of critical security vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel:
one being present in kernel versions from 2.6.1 all the way to 3.15,
the other from 3.4 to 3.14. He also showed that a myriad of high severity
vulnerabilities are continuously being found and addressed&mdash;more than
30 in his data set.

</p></div></div><p>
Although the processes and practices of development teams clearly have
a critical impact on the (in)security of software in embedded products,
there is a clear correlation between the size of the software project's
code base and the number of bugs and vulnerabilities as well. Steve
McConnell in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Code Complete</em></span> states there are 1&ndash;25 bugs and vulnerabilities
per 1,000 lines of code, where the variable is determined by the practices
of the team. Military-certified products typically end up in the lower
end due to more rigid security practices and quality testing, while
consumer electronics are unfortunately in the higher end of the scale
due to the greater focus on features and time to market.
</p><p>
Seasoned software developers always seek to reduce the size of the
code base through refactoring and the reuse of functionality in libraries,
but with the never-ending demand for more features and intelligence
in every product, it is clear that the amount of software in embedded
devices will only grow. This also necessarily implies
that there will be more bugs and vulnerabilities as well.
</p><p>
From this, it should be clear that having a way to deploy bug and security
fixes, as well as new features, remotely is an obvious requirement for
embedded devices with some level of intelligence, especially if they
are network-connected.
</p><p>
This article goes further into specific requirements and solution
designs on deploying software updates to embedded devices, in particular,
embedded Linux.

The State of Software Updates in the Embedded Industry</h2></div></div><p>
As part of the work on Mender, we are conducting interviews with many
software engineers and teams in order to better understand how software
updates are being done in embedded products today. In one series of
these interviews, we spoke with 30 embedded software engineers and the
main takeaways are described below.
</p><p>
In the first question, we simply asked if software updates are being
deployed to their embedded products today and, if so, which tools
were used (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12135f2.large.jpg"><img src="12135f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Survey Response to Whether Software Updates Are Being Deployed to
Embedded Products, and If So, Which Tools Were Used
</p></div></div><p>
45.5% of the respondents said that updates were never being deployed to
their products. Their only way to get new software into customers' hands
was to manufacture hardware with the new software and ship the hardware
to the customers.
</p><p>
Roughly the other half, 54.5%, said that they did have a way to update
their embedded products, but the method was built in-house. This also
includes local updates, where a technician would need to go
to a device physically and update the software from external media, such as a
USB stick. Yet another category was devices enabled for remote updates,
but where you could update only one at the time, essentially precluding
any mass updates. Finally, some had the capability to deploy mass updates
to all devices in a highly automated fashion.
</p><p>
One of the key findings here was that virtually nobody reused a
third-party software updater&mdash;they all re-invented the wheel!
</p><p>
Second, we asked what the preferred method of deploying software
updates is (Figure 3). You can broadly classify embedded updaters into image- or
package-based. Image-based updaters will work on the block level and can
replace an entire partition or storage device. Package-based updaters
work on the file level, and some of them, like RPM/YUM, are well known
in Linux desktop and server environments as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12135f3.large.jpg"><img src="12135f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Survey Results on Software Update Methods
</p></div></div><p>
Image-based updaters have, in general, a clear preference in the embedded
space. The main reason for this is that they typically provide
<span   class="emphasis"><em>atomicity</em></span>
during the update process. Atomicity means that 1) an update is always
either fully applied or not at all, and 2) no other component except
the software updater can ever see a partial update. This property is
very important for embedded updaters, because embedded devices could
lose power or be rebooted at any time, and losing power in the middle
of the update process should not lead to the device becoming bricked
or unusable. The other stated key advantage of image-based updaters
was <span   class="emphasis"><em>consistency across devices</em></span>, meaning that you can more confidently
rely on behavior in test environments being the same as in production
because of the 1:1 software copy.
</p><p>
Package-based approaches generally suffer from not being able to implement
atomic updates, but they have some advantages as well. The installation
time of an update is shorter, and the amount of bandwidth used also can be
smaller than for image-based updates. Finally, since many develop their
homegrown updater and already have packages from their build system,
package-based update systems are generally faster to develop from scratch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bd580.0x16b6068"></a>
The Embedded Environment</h2></div></div><p>
People familiar with Linux desktop and server systems might ask why we
are not just using the same tools and processes that we know from these
systems, including package managers (such as rpm, dpkg), VMs and containers
to carry out software updates. To understand this, it is important to see
in which aspects an embedded device is <span   class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> with regards to applying
software updates.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Unreliable Power</b></span>
</p><p>
I already touched on this property of an embedded system, and
this is a widely known issue: an embedded device can, in general, lose
power at any time. For example, a smart portable audio system can be
unplugged as it is moved around in the house. The battery of a portable
GPS could run out or become unreliable in certain weather conditions.
In-vehicle-infotainment systems in cars can lose power intermittently as
the car is started or stopped. This issue is amplified in battery-powered
devices, as the update process itself can consume significant battery
and cause the power to run out.
</p><p>
Embedded systems must be designed in such a way that they will tolerate
power failure at any given time. The lack of power reliability is in
strong contrast to typical data-center environments, where multiple
redundant power systems will ensure that power is never lost.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Unreliable Network</b></span>
</p><p>
Embedded devices typically are connected using some kind of wireless
technology. Although Wi-Fi is used in some devices, it is more common to
use wireless standards that have longer range but lower data rates, for
example 3G, LoRa, Sigfox and protocols based on IEEE 802.15.4 (low-rate
wireless personal area networks).
</p><p>
It is tempting to assume that high-speed wireless networks will be
generally adopted by embedded devices as technology evolves, just
like what happened with smartphones where you can now stream YouTube
videos in high resolution. However, keep in mind that the use
cases for smartphones and typical embedded devices always will be very
different. For example, an agricultural device that measures and optimizes
crop yield needs a high amount of connectivity and should work even in
places where there is no 3G coverage. In addition, the amount of data
that needs to be sent is very low&mdash;perhaps just a few data points per
day on the temperature and moisture measurements of the earth. So one
should rather assume that embedded devices, especially industrial ones,
always will have a limited network data rate.
</p><p>
In addition, wireless networks have frequent and intermittent connectivity
loss&mdash;for example, when the device is moved to an area with low coverage,
like underground.
</p><p>
Although low data rate and intermittent connectivity can be difficult
design issues, they usually are easy to identify once something is
not right.
</p><p>
Security issues over public wireless networks are much more implicit
and difficult to expose. In the context of software updates, there
are countless examples of homegrown updaters that do not properly
authenticate the update, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code
while the update is taking place.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Expensive Physical Access</b></span>
</p><p>
Once a large-scale issue that cannot be fixed remotely occurs, the cost
of remediating it is typically very high. The reason is that embedded
devices are typically widely distributed geographically.
</p><p>
For example, a manufacturer of smart energy grid devices can install these
devices in thousands of homes in several countries. If there is a critical
issue with an update to the Linux kernel that cannot be fixed remotely,
the cost of either sending a service technician to all those homes or
asking customers to send devices back to the vendor can be prohibitive.
</p><p>
The 2015 Fiat-Chrysler Jeep Cherokee security breach offers a recent
real-world example of wide-scale recalls. In this case, 1.4 million cars
were recalled. The cost of repairing this issue was certainly in the
hundred-million dollar range, perhaps even billions.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Five-to-Ten-Year Device Lifetime</b></span>
</p><p>
Technology moves very fast, and it's typical to replace common consumer
electronics devices like smartphones and laptops every two to three years.
</p><p>
However, more expensive consumer devices like high-end audio systems and
TVs are replaced less frequently. Industrial devices that do not directly
interact with humans typically have even longer lifetimes. For example,
robots used on factory floors or energy grid devices easily can reach
a ten-year lifetime.
</p><p>
In conclusion, in the embedded environment, people need to be very wary of the
risk of &ldquo;bricking&rdquo; devices. Not only can this easily happen due
to the power and network properties, but it is also a very expensive
situation from which to
recover.

Key Criteria for Embedded Software Updaters</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you
are more familiar with the embedded environment, let's consider the
implications this has for an embedded software updater.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15bd580.0x16b6ab8"></a>
Robust and Secure</h2></div></div><p>
As you've seen, both the power and the network can be very unreliable
and insecure in an embedded environment. An embedded updater must have a couple properties
and features in order to 
tackle these challenges sufficiently.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Atomic Updates</b></span>
</p><p>
The database industry is very familiar with the concept of atomic
transactions&mdash;the &ldquo;A&rdquo; in ACID, where a set of operations either all
complete or none of them complete. The classic example for the need for
this requirement in database theory is with online transactions. When
one user transfers money to another, deducting money from one account
should occur only if you also successfully add the money to the other
account.
</p><p>
This same property is very important for embedded updaters, in order to
handle intermittent update errors like sudden power loss. For an embedded
updater, the atomic property can be defined in two parts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An update is always either <span   class="emphasis"><em>completed fully</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not at all</em></span>. 
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>No software
component</em></span> (besides the updater) ever sees a <span   class="emphasis"><em>partially
installed update</em></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can see that common ways of deploying software updates in the desktop
environment do not meet this atomicity requirement. For example, while you
are installing an rpm package, many files are written and modified across
the filesystem, and they would be in an inconsistent and potentially
non-recoverable state if you suddenly unplugged your desktop during the
installation&mdash;the application being updated probably wouldn't start
at all.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Consistent Deployments</b></span>
</p><p>
An important approach to mitigate the risks of bricking devices is
to test new software updates extensively before releasing them into
production. However, in order to rely on test results, you need a
test environment that is as identical as possible to the production
environment. It is a classic problem in general operations, be it
for embedded devices or data centers, that the test environment diverges from
production, so that changes work well in the test environment but cause
significant downtime when released to production. This is one of the
reasons why full-image updates are so prevalent in the embedded space. If your
entire root filesystem is the same, block by block, in the test and
production environments, then there are guaranteed similarities. Contrast
this to a deployment using rpm packages, which may depend on libraries
that have different versions, or patches, on the test and production
environments, and maybe even across the production environments
as well. Over time, such a design typically will lead to production
deployments that fail for reasons that are inconsistent and hard to
diagnose.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Authenticity Checks before Updates</b></span>
</p><p>
From a security perspective, it is very important to know whether software
comes from an authorized source or whether an attacker could have injected
malicious software into the update. There have been countless cases
where embedded devices are simply broadcasting their desire to install
an update, and anyone who responds would be able to inject the software
of their choosing into the device.
</p><p>
A basic approach to ensuring a level of authenticity is to leverage
in-transit security protocols like TLS. If done correctly, this will
ensure that the update cannot be modified while in transit from an
update server to the device.
</p><p>
However, a more robust end-to-end approach is to embed cryptographic
authenticity metadata as part of the update itself. Typically a form
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>code signing</em></span> is employed, where digital signatures are created by an
authority and verified at the device.
</p><p>
One of the key advantages of code signing over solely relying on
in-transit security is that the authority that signs the update can be
decoupled from the server that hosts it. For example, someone in the QA
department could sign an update offline. This reduces the attack surface
in cases where the update server gets compromised, because an attacker
can still deploy only updates that have been signed by the QA department.
</p><p>
For performance-sensitive devices, cryptographic mechanisms like
Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Elliptic Curve signatures should
be considered, as they provide much more efficient verification than RSA
or DSA at the same level of security.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Sanity Checks after Updates</b></span>
</p><p>
Embedded devices are typically single-purpose and run only one main
application, although in some cases, they could run several. In either
instance, it's important to check the health of such applications after
deploying an update. Are they running? Do they have network access? Can
the user interact with them successfully on the device?
</p><p>
A software update should not be considered successful just because the
device boots; there should be a way to integrate custom application
sanity checks as well. Finally, a critical check that should be covered
by the updater generically is this: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Is it possible to deploy another
update?</em></span>
</p><p>
If any of these checks fail, the updater should have the capability to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>roll back</em></span> to the previous known-working software, so that downtime is
avoided while the issue is being diagnosed and resolved.
</p><p>
The general workflow for deploying software updates is shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12135f4.large.jpg"><img src="12135f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. General Workflow for Deploying Software Updates
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Integration with Existing Development Workflow</b></span>
</p><p>
If you are one person starting from scratch with an embedded/IoT project,
you likely can choose all the tools and processes you like the
best. However, once several people are collaborating on the same project,
and in particular, if there is a product already being developed before
software updates were taken into account, it is very important that the
software update process integrates well with the development workflow.
</p><p>
At first glance, this may look like a strange criteria for an updater,
but many approaches to software updates require a
full replacement of existing development workflows. Commercial updater
tools more often than not are offered as part of a &ldquo;platform&rdquo;, where
the updater is bundled together with a full device OS, a cloud back end
and other device management features. For existing products, this can
pose a significant challenge, because the device OS needs to be replaced,
potentially also together with the build system, version control and
associated QA processes.
</p><p>
For homegrown updaters, this criteria is typically implicitly taken into
account, because teams tend to start with what they have and see what
is the shortest path to develop and integrate an updater into it. Since
existing build systems tend to output packages like rpm or opkg easily,
this is an approach that integrates well and is chosen by many homegrown
updaters. However, package-based updates have significant drawbacks with
respect to lack of robustness, as I discussed earlier.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bandwidth</b></span>
</p><p>
As I mentioned previously, embedded devices typically are connected with
some kind of low data rate wireless connection. An update process that
requires less bandwidth will be favorable over one that takes more,
simply because it would cost less and take less time to deploy an update.
</p><p>
Compression is the first feature to look at in order to reduce bandwidth,
as this could cut the size of the update in half or more, depending
on type and compressibility of the update. There is also a variety of
delta-based update mechanisms that could be employed to reduce
bandwidth usage further.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Downtime during Update</b></span>
</p><p>
While an update is being deployed, it is desirable to have as little
downtime on the device as possible. How much downtime is acceptable
is clearly dependent on the use case of the embedded device. Is it part
of the power grid that must function 24x7, or is it a consumer audio
system that isn't used at night?
</p><p>
The method for deploying updates impacts the required downtime the
most. For example, for full image updates, it's possible to deploy the
update from a maintenance mode or use a dual-A/B rootfs approach. The
maintenance-mode approach works by rebooting into a maintenance
partition, installing the update to the root filesystem partition and
then rebooting into the root filesystem partition again; the device
is unusable for all of this period. In a dual-A/B rootfs approach, the
update is installed to the inactive root filesystem while the device
can continue to be used. The downtime in this case is only during the
reboot into the updated (previously inactive) partition. The dual-A/B
rootfs partition update design is shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12135f5.large.jpg"><img src="12135f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Dual-A/B rootfs Partition Update Design 
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Deployment Management</b></span>
</p><p>
As you can see, many design choices and trade-offs need to be made
on the device side for an embedded updater client.
</p><p>
However, once an updater client is installed and working on embedded
devices, the problem of managing all those clients becomes apparent. How
can a new update be installed on 1,000 of these embedded devices? Which
version of the software are they running? How do you know if an update is
installed successfully everywhere, and is there a log for failed updates?
</p><p>
These use cases typically are handled with an update management server,
so that updates can be managed across a device fleet.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Many design trade-offs need to be considered in
order to deploy software updates to IoT devices. Although historically
most teams have decided to implement their homegrown updaters, the recent
appearance of several open-source software updaters for embedded Linux
means that we should be able to stop re-inventing the wheel.
