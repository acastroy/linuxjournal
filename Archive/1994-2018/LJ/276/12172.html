<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Firmware support has become more and more difficult to maintain over time,
especially as
more and more features have been added. Some features aren't even about loading
firmware so much as just doing something that's more easily done at the same
time as loading the firmware. And, whenever the firmware API gets updated, the
patch has to include updates to all user code that uses that particular
programmer interface. Over time, this tends to make the patches bigger and more
error-prone overall.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> recently proposed a new firmware API, not quite a total
replacement of the existing code, but something that would at least make more
sense and tolerate updates more easily. At the same time, the new code would
leave open the question of certain thorny problems, such as what to do when a
particular piece of firmware doesn't work. What's the fallback procedure? For
this, he described the existing code as &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; and didn't want to touch it
until various other issues could be resolved. For example, he said that the kernel's
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> code contained race conditions that would have an impact on any attempt to
fix up the firmware fallback implementation, so the one would have to wait for
the other.
</p><p>
Various folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Bjorn Andersson</b></span> had suggestions and
objections. In particular, Bjorn wanted the old firmware API to go away at some
point and be fully replaced by the new interface. But, Luis said the two would
have to coexist for the foreseeable future, although he did add that the old
interface would become static, and all new fixes and updates would go into the
new API.
</p><p>
Hardware acceleration involves performing certain work in hardware that was
specifically built for that purpose, as opposed to doing the same work using the
standard opcodes available on a general-purpose CPU. In terms of efficiency, all
else being equal, specialized hardware beats the pants off general-purpose
CPUs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Binoy Jayan</b></span> recently wanted to migrate
some of the kernel's <span   class="bold"><b>crypto code</b></span> into
hardware to take advantage of that speedup opportunity&mdash;specifically the
<span   class="bold"><b>initialization vector</b></span> (IV) routines in the
<span   class="bold"><b>dm-crypt.c</b></span> file. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Milan Broz</b></span>
warned against moving the code out of dm-crypt.c, because it would make it
harder for the crypto team to modify the key data structures in the future, if
they so desired. Also, he said, some of the IV generator code was hacky and
risky, and it shouldn't be considered good enough to migrate into hardware.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Binoy's code became more and more controversial, as folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Ondrej Mosn&aacute;&ccedil;ek</b></span> proposed completely different solutions to the problems Binoy
wanted to address.
</p><p>
By the end of the discussion, hardware acceleration remained an option for the
crypto IV routines, but there still was no agreement on the exact
implementation.
</p><p>
The quest to access more and more memory is ongoing. <span   class="bold"><b>Nikita Yushchenko</b></span> recently
pointed out that while <span   class="bold"><b>PCI</b></span> devices
potentially could support up to 64-bit DMA
(direct memory access) addressing, some of the PCI code, such as host bridge,
had software limitations that prevented it. Nikita wanted at least to prevent
PCI devices from claiming the ability to access that much memory, if it couldn't
in reality.
</p><p>
During the course of discussion, however, and particularly with <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd Bergmann</b></span>,
who'd written his own patch to address the issue in a different way, it turned
out that Nikita wasn't entirely sure where the RAM access limitations really
were. It ended up being a thorny question. Arnd and Nikita pursued the problem
together, each cursing loudly (and loudly agreeing with each other) over the
horribleness of the API.
</p><p>
The discussion ended with only an incomplete understanding of the problem, but
at least the question had been identified. The issue of how best to allow PCI
devices to access 64-bit DMA addresses remains open.
</p><p>
The kernel boot process is one of the scariest parts of the whole kernel. Trying
to support every CPU ever made, including those with hardware errors,
mis-features and various other design flaws, is quite simply insane. It should
be no surprise that efforts to improve the boot process tend to be highly
controversial.
</p><p>
Trying to support the <span   class="bold"><b>multiboot
specification</b></span>, for example, turns out to have
all kinds of pitfalls. <span   class="bold"><b>Chao Peng</b></span> tried to
do this recently, and <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span>
offered strenuous objection. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Multiboot has a fundamentally broken
assumption, which is to do certain work for the kernel in the bootloader. This
is fundamentally a bad idea, because you always want to do things in the latest
step possible during the boot process, being the most upgradeable, and have the
interface as narrow as possible. Therefore, using Multiboot is actively a
negative step. It is declared an &ldquo;Open Standard&rdquo; but anything can be such
declared; it really is a claim that &ldquo;everything should work like
Grub.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The debate was not resolved during this email thread, but typically the boot
specification would need to address the kernel folks' objections before any code
would be accepted.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: a World without Dongles</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When it first came out, I thought the Palm Touchstone Charging Dock
was just about the coolest idea ever. Of course, the Palm Pre that
it charged never really became popular, and I'm not even sure Palm
exists as a company anymore. That wireless charging idea was really
cool though. Nowadays companies like Samsung include wireless charging
capability in many of their phones, and there's actually a standard
(thank goodness) that all or most of the manufacturers use. It's called
Qi, and even if your phone doesn't support wireless charging, you
might want to learn more.
</p><p>
Although I'm not certain whether Palm used the Qi standard back in the day,
that standard means you can get very inexpensive charging pads and
place them all over your home and office. The charging pads are small
and usually are less than $20 each. And because Qi is a standard, it means
you can charge any Qi device on any Qi charger&mdash;Android or iPhone. And
even cooler? If your device doesn't support built-in Qi charging, there
are slick add-on devices you can put under your case to transform your
phone into a wirelessly chargeable one!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12172androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
For $10&ndash;$15 I was able to find many options that plug in to the
micro-USB port on my Android device and fit under my case. That means I can
just place my phone on any Qi base (I have several), and my phone 
happily will charge without ever getting plugged in. The only thing to pay
attention to is the size of the add-on charging receiver and which way
the USB port faces. It isn't terribly useful if your charging receiver
is located over the screen of your phone instead of over the back.
</p><p>
This technology has changed the way I think about charging my phone,
and if you place a few charging pads around your house and workplace, it
will change yours too. And if your device supports Qi charging natively,
like many Samsung Galaxy devices, using Qi is a no-brainer!

<h2 class="title">Spend Bitcoin Anywhere</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've written about Bitcoin several times during the past few years, and I still love
the technology. I am a little disturbed by the amount of electricity the
Bitcoin blockchain consumes using dirty power sources, but that's another
discussion altogether. Although there are many places to spend Bitcoin
directly, and services like Purse.io exist that allow you to spend Bitcoin at
Amazon, what if you want to buy a pack of gum at the local gas station?
</p><p>
I recently ordered two different Bitcoin debit cards. One card
is from BitPay (<a href="https://bitpay.com/card" target="_self">https://bitpay.com/card</a>), and one is from Shift
(<a href="https://www.shiftpayments.com/card" target="_self">https://www.shiftpayments.com/card</a>). They both conceptually do the same
thing, which is convert your Bitcoin into currency that can be spent
anyplace that accepts debit cards. They work slightly differently in
function though.
</p><p>
The BitPay card is a &ldquo;reloadable&rdquo; debit card that allows you to add US
Dollars to your card. When you load the card, Bitcoin is converted at the
current price, and the dollar amount is stored in your account. Once the
card is loaded, Bitcoin is out of the equation, and fluctuating prices
don't matter. If you want to know exactly how much money you have on
your card, the BitPay card is the way to go.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172bitf1.large.jpg"><img src="12172bitf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
In contrast, the Shift card doesn't have any money loaded onto it. Rather,
the Shift card connects to a Coinbase account, and at the time of
purchase, your Bitcoin is converted to US dollars. This is actually
&ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; than the BitPay method, but the volatility of Bitcoin can
mean your actual available money isn't consistent. If Bitcoin tanks,
so does your buying ability with the Shift card.
</p><p>
Each card was $10 to buy, and neither has an ongoing fee to use. The
transactions don't cost anything, and the only fees are when one of the
cards is used at an ATM to get cash. Considering that you instantly can get
cash from an ATM from Bitcoin, however, the small fee associated with
the process isn't too difficult to accept.
</p><p>
If you've been avoiding digital currency because you don't have any
way to spend it, I urge you to check out one or both of these cards.
There are other options, but these seemed like the best deal,
and I've personally used both.

<h2 class="title">Image Processing on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've looked at several scientific packages in this space that generate
nice graphical representations of your data and work, but I've
not gone in the other direction much. So in this article, I cover
a popular image processing package called ImageJ. Specifically, I am 
looking at Fiji (<a href="https://imagej.net/Fiji" target="_self">https://imagej.net/Fiji</a>), an instance of ImageJ bundled with a set of plugins
that are useful for scientific image processing. 
</p><p>
The name Fiji is a
recursive acronym, much like GNU. It stands for &ldquo;Fiji
Is Just ImageJ&rdquo;. ImageJ is a useful tool for analyzing images in
scientific research&mdash;for example, you may use it for classifying
tree types in a landscape from aerial photography. ImageJ can do
that type categorization. It's built with a plugin architecture,
and a very extensive collection of plugins is available to increase the
available functionality.
</p><p>
The first step is to install ImageJ (or Fiji). Most distributions will
have a package available for ImageJ. If you wish, you can install it
that way and then install the individual plugins you need for your
research. The other option is to install Fiji and get the most commonly
used plugins at the same time. Unfortunately, most Linux distributions
will not have a package available within their package repositories for
Fiji. Luckily, however, an easy installation file is available from the
main website. It's a simple zip file, containing a directory with all of
the files required to run Fiji. When you first start it, you 
get only a small toolbar with a list of menu items (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif1.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You get a very minimal interface when you first start Fiji.
</p></div></div><p>
If you don't
already have some images to use as you are learning to work
with ImageJ, the Fiji installation includes several sample images.
Click the File&rarr;Open
Samples menu item for a dropdown list of sample images (Figure 2). These
samples cover many of the potential tasks you might be interested
in working on. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12172fijif2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Several sample images are available that you can use as you
learn how to work with ImageJ.
</p></div></div><p>
If you installed Fiji, rather than ImageJ alone, 
a large set of plugins already will be installed. The first one of note
is the autoupdater plugin. This plugin checks the internet for updates
to ImageJ, as well as the installed plugins, each time ImageJ is
started. 
</p><p>
All of the installed plugins are available under the Plugins menu item.
Once you have installed a number of plugins, this list can
become a bit unwieldy, so you may want to be judicious in your plugin
selection. If you want to trigger the updates manually, click
the Help&rarr;Update Fiji menu item to force the check and get a list
of available updates (Figure 3). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif3.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can force a manual check of what updates are available.
</p></div></div><p>
Now, what kind of work can you do with Fiji/ImageJ? One example is
doing counts of objects within an image. You can load a sample
by clicking File&rarr;Open Samples&rarr;Embryos.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif4.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. With ImageJ, you can count objects within an image.
</p></div></div><p>
The first step is to set a scale to the image so
you can tell ImageJ how to identify objects. First, select the
line button on the toolbar and draw a line over the length of the scale
legend on the image. You then can select Analyze&rarr;Set
Scale, and it will set the number of pixels that the scale legend
occupies (Figure 5). You can set the known distance to be 100
and the units to be &ldquo;um&rdquo;. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12172fijif5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. For many image analysis tasks, you need to set a scale to the image.
</p></div></div><p>
The next step is to simplify the information
within the image. Click Image&rarr;Type&rarr;8-bit to reduce
the information to an 8-bit gray-scale image. To isolate the individual
objects, click Process&rarr;Binary&rarr;Make Binary
to threshold the image automatically (Figure 6). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif6.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. There are tools to do automatic tasks like thresholding.
</p></div></div><p>
Before you can count
the objects within the image, you need to remove artifacts like the
scale legend. You can do that by using the rectangular selection tool
to select it and then click Edit&rarr;Clear. Now you
can analyze the image and see what objects are there. 
</p><p>
Making sure that
there are no areas selected in the image, click 
Analyze&rarr;Analyze Particles to pop up a window where you can select
the minimum size, what results to display and what to show in the final
image (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif7.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can generate a reduced image with identified particles.
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 8 shows an overall look at what was discovered in the summary
results window. There is also a detailed results window for
each individual particle.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12172fijif8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. One of the output results includes a summary list of the
particles identified.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have an analysis worked out for a given image type,
you often need to apply the exact same analysis to a series
of images. This series may number into the thousands, so it's typically
not something you will want to repeat manually for each image. In such
cases, you can collect the required steps together into a macro so
that they can be reapplied multiple times. Clicking 
Plugins&rarr;Macros&rarr;Record pops up a new window where all of your
subsequent commands will be recorded. Once all of the steps are finished,
you can save them as a macro file and rerun them on other images by
clicking Plugins&rarr;Macros&rarr;Run. 
</p><p>
If you have a very
specific set of steps for your workflow, you simply can open the macro
file and edit it by hand, as it is a simple text file. There is actually
a complete macro language available to you to control the
process that is being applied to your images more fully. 
</p><p>
If you have a really large
set of images that needs to be processed, however, this still might be
too tedious for your workflow. In that case, go to 
Process&rarr;Batch&rarr;Macro to pop up a new window where you can
set up your batch processing workflow (Figure 9).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172fijif9.large.jpg"><img src="12172fijif9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can run a macro on a batch of input image files with a single
command.
</p></div></div><p>
From this window,
you can select which macro file to apply, the source directory where
the input images are located and the output directory where you want the output
images to be written. You also can set the output file format and
filter the list of images being used as input based on what the filename
contains. 
Once everything is done, start the batch run by clicking
the Process button at the bottom of the window. 
</p><p>
If this is a workflow
that will be repeated over time, you can save the batch process to a text
file by clicking the Save button at the bottom of the window. You
then can reload the same workflow by clicking the Open button,
also at the bottom of the window. All of this functionality allows you
to automate the most tedious parts of your research so you can
focus on the actual science.
</p><p>
Considering that there are more than 500 plugins and more than 300 macros
available from the main ImageJ website alone, it is an understatement
that I've been able to touch on only the most basic of topics in this
short article. Luckily, many domain-specific tutorials are
available, along with the very good documentation for the core of ImageJ
from the main project website. If you think this tool 
could be of use to your research, there is a wealth of information to
guide you in your particular area of study.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: How to Make Windows Better? Make It Chocolatey!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Once again, my friend and fellow <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> club member Kris Occhipinti
introduced me to an awesome bit of software. This time, it's an open-source project that brings Linux-like package management to Windows! Don't
get me wrong; installing software on Windows isn't difficult,
but it's definitely more cumbersome than with Linux. Plus, with Chocolatey
(<a href="http://chocolatey.org" target="_self">chocolatey.org</a>), you can keep your installed packages up to date
as easily as you can with Linux.
</p><p>
There is an open-source version of Chocolatey and paid versions. With
the open-source version, you can install and maintain all the community
packages, which for me is plenty. Literally thousands of
software packages are available to install with a simple command-line
entry. And unlike Cygwin (a wonderful program as well), Chocolatey
installs the same Windows applications you'd install if you downloaded
the installers and went through the process on your own.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12172fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Installation on Windows can be done via the command prompt (cmd.exe)
or via Powershell. If you open the command prompt as administrator (right-click,
open as administrator, see screenshot), you can install with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command 
 &#8618;"iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString
&#8618;('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" &amp;&amp; SET 
 &#8618;"PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
</pre>
</p><p>
Or even better, visit <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install" target="_self">https://chocolatey.org/install</a> for more options
and a chance to look at the installation script before installing. The site
actually recommends looking at the installation code before running it
to make sure it's safe. That doesn't make me less confident of the code,
but it makes me happy to see smart security choices.
</p><p>
So, thanks to making Windows a bit more like Linux and easing the process
of keeping your software up to date, Chocolatey earns this month's Editors'
Choice award. If you use Windows, head over to the website and check
out this awesome system. It's especially useful for brand-new Windows
installs, because managing all your third-party software with a single
tool is wonderful. Thanks again, Kris!

<h2 class="title">Gaming Like It's 1989</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's no secret that I love classic gaming. It seems like every other
month,
I write about an emulation project or some online version of a 1980s
classic. The system that defined my youth was the Nintendo Entertainment
System, or the NES. Its chunky rectangle controller and two-button setup
may seem simple today, but back then, it was revolutionary. My hands
still even form to the awkward controllers automatically like they did back
in middle school.
</p><p>
Knowing that people like me exist, and that we're now old enough to
buy things, Nintendo recently released its NES Classic Edition. Although
they're still absurdly hard to find, I managed to buy one. And for anyone
wondering whether the tiny replica is worth the $60 (okay, I paid $80), if the
NES defined your youth, I would say <span   class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span>!
</p><p>
I was worried the controller wouldn't feel like the original. I read a few
reviews that said they felt too light or cheaper than the old ones. Well,
I have both original controllers for my emulation machine that I wrote
about a few
months back and the controller that came with the NES Classic Edition,
and I can say they both feel about the same. Also, although the gameplay
isn't any different on the NES Classic Edition versus my emulation
machine, I'm actually quite happy to pay for the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; device and
give Nintendo money. I know ROMs are easy to find, but the only reason
I download them illegitimately is that I can't buy them legally. Now,
at least for 30 of the best games, I can!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12172nesf1.large.jpg"><img src="12172nesf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I'm a hacker at heart, so although I urge you to buy the NES Classic
if you're into that sort of gaming, I also want to play a few games
that are not included. Thankfully, the NES Classic is super easy to hack. It's
possible to hack the device to add ROMs manually, but there's also
a great open-source tool called hakchi2 that will do all the heavy
lifting for you. From what I can tell, it's a Windows-only program,
but if you want a simple way to add a few ROMs, it's the way to
go: <a href="https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2" target="_self">https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2</a>.
</p><p>
The hardest part? Finding an NES Classic Edition in stock. Good luck
fellow gamers.
