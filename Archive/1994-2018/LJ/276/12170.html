I'm not sure what problem Vanilla Ice solved with his DJ's sick hook, but
thankfully in the Linux world, we solve problems all the time. In fact,
Linux exists as a solution to a problem&mdash;25+ years later, and Linux is
still solving problems all the time. This month, let's attack some problems
the penguin way.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts out with how to program computers to do work we'd
rather not do ourselves. Specifically, Reuven shows how to automate the sorting of
documents. Although the process might not be quite as boring as collating
paperwork, sorting documents by subject is monotonous at best. Reuven
describes
how to program away this annoying task. Dave Taylor follows with the
problem of potential photograph theft. With your photos on the internet,
it's very easy for someone, even someone with innocent intent, to violate
your copyrights. Adding a watermark to your photos is a great way to inform
viewers that you own the graphic. Dave shows how to do it from the
command line.
</p><p>
Next, we look at managing problems with Kyle Rankin. Even problem-solving systems
have problems, and if you're in a big environment, it's important to track
the management of issues. Kyle explains the process for implementing a
successful ticketing system in your organization. In my early days of being
a system administrator, we had green sheets of paper where users would
write their problems and leave them in a basket for me. Those &ldquo;Green
Sheets&rdquo; provided an incredible service to me and my users. Now, there are
many digital systems that provide far more useful information than the
papers in my basket.
</p><p>
The problem I solve this month is cable TV. I talked about cord cutting in
the past, but I finally boxed up my TiVo units and went the route of the
antenna. It's a complicated endeavor to set up an antenna for broadcast
channels, especially if you're in a fringe area. Add to that the need for
integrating OTA channels into my network-based entertainment system, and
it's an article worth reading if you want to cut the cord!
</p><p>
Paul Ferretti talks about three of my favorite topics in a single article.
Linux, robots and space are pretty much the keywords I look for in any
book I read. Paul talks about NASA's work reaching out for problem solvers
who want to create robots that can do significant work in the space
program. If you're looking to make reliable robots, it makes a lot of sense
to use Linux as your foundation. 
</p><p>
In fact, many embedded systems in robots use Linux. Eystein Stenberg
follows Paul with a look at keeping those embedded systems updated. All too
often once an embedded system is put into production, the operating system
is never updated. It does a single job, and it does it well, so why
upgrade? Well, if those systems are connected to a network, they're a huge
vector for attack. Eystein walks through the complicated world of
keeping embedded systems secure.
</p><p>
Regardless of the problem you need to solve, if you're like me, Linux is
always one of the first options to consider. Whether it's a real-world
problem like your car's embedded computer getting hacked or an
intellectual issue regarding photograph copyright, this month, we focus on
fixing things. We hope this issue is as useful to you as it was to all of
us who put it together!
