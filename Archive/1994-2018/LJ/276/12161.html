It's pretty darn easy to analyze and
manipulate images from within a shell script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd83b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Us geeks mostly think of the command line as the best place for text
manipulation. It's a natural with <tt  >cat</tt>,
<tt  >grep</tt> and shell scripts. But
although you can't necessarily view your results from within a typical
terminal window, it turns out to be pretty darn easy to analyze and
manipulate images from within a shell script.
</p><p>
In my last article, I introduced the splendid open-source ImageMagick suite that
offers more features and functionality than you can shake a tree's
worth of branches at. Why you would be shaking a tree at a piece of
software escapes me, but, hey, I'm just writing this stuff, not
thinking about what I'm saying.
</p><p>
Um...wait a sec.
</p><p>
Anyway, ImageMagick includes a variety of programs that let you analyze,
manipulate and even convert image files in a remarkable number of different
ways.
</p><p>
My last article described setting things up and a few easy ways to
confirm that the suite was working correctly on your computer. Now let's
start with a simple task that can be useful for web servers: a
script that checks image files and flags any that are more than a specific
size.
</p><p>
In fact, let's use 8MB because that's the maximum size allowed in
Facebook Open Graph, a fact of which many webmasters are already well
aware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ae0580.0x1bd87d0"></a>
Finding Those Big Darn Image Files</h2></div></div><p>
Identifying big files can be done with a simple
<tt  >find</tt>, but the goal here is to do
something more sophisticated, so let's pair it with the
ImageMagick command <tt  >identify</tt>.
</p><p>
Here's a loop to identify files bigger than a specified size:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in `find *{png,jpg} -size +8M -print`
do
    echo file $name is bigger than 8MB
done
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a good start, but for those image files that match, more detail
would be helpful, and I'm not talking <tt  >ls -l</tt> output!
Instead, let's
replace the rudimentary <tt  >echo</tt> statement with something more
advanced:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
dimensions=$(identify $name | cut -d\  -f3)
size=$(identify $name | cut -d\  -f7)
echo "File $name ($dimensions) has file size $size"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's have a quick test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh bigimages.sh
File screenshot-6.png (1800x490) has file size 9.639MB
$
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >It's definitely more informative than just doing an <tt>ls -l</tt> and particularly so if you
were to put this in an automatic email report for hosting
clients!</tt>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Why? Because lots of people who aren't tech-savvy upload images
directly from digital cameras&mdash;images that can be enormous. They resize the
displayed image in their blog posts, but the original files are way larger
than necessary, slowing down their sites unnecessarily.</em></span>
</p><p>
Before moving on, let me make a few comments. First, notice the size test with
<tt  >find</tt>:
<tt  >-size +8M</tt>. <tt  >find</tt> has a weird
view of numbers and comparisons, and the test
<tt  >-size 8M</tt> would match only files that are exactly 8MB
in size&mdash;not useful.
Without the &ldquo;M&rdquo; suffix, the test would be comparing to 512-byte
blocks, so +8 would match a lot of files (because eight 512-byte blocks is only
4K, and that's tiny for an image file). <tt  >find</tt> also knows &ldquo;K&rdquo; for
kilobytes, &ldquo;G&rdquo; for gigabytes, &ldquo;T&rdquo; for terabytes and, yes,
&ldquo;P&rdquo; for petabytes.
</p><p>
The second observation to make is the use of quotes with the
<tt  >echo</tt>
statement. Try it. Without quotes, the shell would complain about the use of
parentheses, and with single quotes, it would show the variable names, not expand
them. It's a good real-world reminder of the subtle, but important quote nuances
in the shell!

Add a Watermark</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most popular uses of ImageMagick isn't to identify image
dimensions but to add watermarks. You've seen watermarks on images all
over the web. Sometimes it's a little copyright notice, a URL or even a tiny
graphical bug that identifies the source or ownership of the image.
</p><p>
Nice effect, but how do you do it? Use the <tt  >convert</tt> command. In fact, if
you want to just add a text overlay on the bottom of an image, the command
is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
convert $source label:'LinuxJournal.com'-append $output
</pre>
</p><p>
The default isn't very glamorous, however, so you'll inevitably
want to customize it a bit. To make the font a bit larger, use
<tt  >-pointsize</tt>, and to move the watermark text to be in the lower right instead
of its default position, use <tt  >-gravity</tt>.
</p><p>
This is a bit more sophisticated and shows some of the weirdness of
ImageMagick:

<pre     class="programlisting">
convert $source -pointsize 80 -gravity east \
    label:'LinuxJournal.com' -append $output
</pre>
</p><p>
This easily can be poured into a script, of course, and either you can have
the output images in a different directory or you can rewrite the source
filename appropriately. My favorite way to accomplish the latter is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
predot=$(echo $name | rev | cut -d. -f2- | rev)
postdot=$(echo $name | rev | cut -d. -f1 | rev)
newname=$(echo ${predot}-wm.$postdot)
</pre>
</p><p>
Since there's no &ldquo;last field&rdquo; option in
<tt  >cut</tt>, the way to grab
just the filename suffix, even if the base filename contains dots, is to
reverse the name, grab the <span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> field, then reverse
it again. This way, you 
can take a filename like &ldquo;red.rose.png&rdquo; and rewrite it as
&ldquo;red.rose-wm.png&rdquo; to denote the version that has the watermark
added.
</p><p>
But, what if you have a small graphic bug you want to overlay on the lower
left corner of the image instead?
</p><p>
Let's assume the watermark graphic is specified with the variable
<tt  >$copy</tt>. With that in mind, a nice blend of the two images can be achieved
with a 100% dissolve:

<pre     class="programlisting">
composite -dissolve 100 $copy $source $output
</pre>
</p><p>
That will put the graphic on the top left corner of the resultant image,
&ldquo;above&rdquo; the underlying photograph or graphic.
</p><p>
You can move it to the lower right by using
<tt  >-gravity</tt>&mdash;literally. Imagine a
compass overlaid on your image: &ldquo;north&rdquo; is up,
&ldquo;east&rdquo; is
the right side, &ldquo;west&rdquo; is the left side and so on. With the
<tt  >convert -label</tt> command shown earlier, the default position
was the bottom of the resultant image, so gravity of &ldquo;east&rdquo; moved
the label to the lower right.
</p><p>
With <tt  >composite</tt>, however, there's a lot more flexibility, so positioning
the copyright bug in the lower right involves using a gravity of
&ldquo;southeast&rdquo;&mdash;like this: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
composite -dissolve 100 -gravity southeast $copy $source $output
</pre>
</p><p>
Wrap that in a <tt  >for</tt> loop, and you've got a handy script that 
can add text watermarks along the bottom or overlay a graphic watermark or
copyright instead. 
</p><p>
In both cases, notice that the ImageMagick commands always create a new
output file. If you want to <span   class="emphasis"><em>replace</em></span> an image with a version that includes a
watermark, you'd need to do a bit of file shuffling:

<pre     class="programlisting">
composite -dissolve 100 $copy $source $output
mv $output $source
</pre>
</p><p>
Ideally though, you'd check to ensure that the
<tt  >composite</tt> command
worked properly (rather than potentially deleting files or producing a
cryptic error). Two ways come to mind: check the error status of the
<tt  >composite</tt> command (the sequence <tt  >$?</tt>) or just test for the existence of
<tt  >$output</tt>. Here's the latter, since then you aren't reliant on
<tt  >composite</tt> having accurate return codes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
composite -dissolve 100 $copy $source $output
if [ -x $output ] ; then
  mv $output $source
else
  echo "Couldn't replace $source, $output wasn't created?"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Is that good? Maybe not. The <tt  >-x</tt> test checks for the existence of the file,
but what would be better would be to ensure that the file exists and is
non-zero size. That's the <tt  >-s</tt> flag. It's a simple
switch, and you've got the
basis for a good script.

Magic with Images</h2></div></div><p>
The ImageMagick suite contains a number of commands that have dozens to
hundreds of parameters. They can be very quirky, as the
<tt  >gravity</tt> setting
shows&mdash;be glad I didn't delve into the
<tt  >geometry</tt>
parameters&mdash;but fortunately, there are lots of online tutorials and help pages.
