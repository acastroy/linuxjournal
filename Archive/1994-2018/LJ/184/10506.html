<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #184, August 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Some interesting <span   class="bold"><b>intellectual property</b></span> issues surfaced recently. With
the settlement between <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>TomTom</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Martin
Steigerwald</b></span>
thought it would be a good idea to replace <span   class="bold"><b>VFAT</b></span> as removable media's
standard cross-platform filesystem under Linux. No sense risking a
lawsuit from Microsoft, he felt. But, although there was some support for
the idea, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to address VFAT's
ubiquity. Most filesystem projects would like to gain as many users as
possible, so starting a filesystem project whose goal is to migrate
all of VFAT's users to it would be nothing new. Still, Martin's idea
may find some adherents. <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Williamson</b></span> suggested as an alternative
the possibility of a filesystem over <span   class="bold"><b>USB</b></span>, which would let each device
use whatever on-disk filesystem it chose, while providing seamless
communication between them, at least in theory.
</p><p>
It's not clear what, if anything, will come out of that debate; the
modern patent system is truly broken. But Microsoft apparently has not
bothered about VFAT in Linux yet, so maybe the kernel folks will
decide to wait until something more threatening happens.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span> has applied for a software patent,
specifically so as to include his code in the kernel without fear that
some other company might try to patent the algorithm and use it
against the Open Source community. As it turns out, <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> thought
at first that Steven had the standard evil motive and gave him a
pretty good dressing down, saying that the kernel really should avoid
using patented algorithms anywhere in the kernel. But, Steven explained
the situation, and <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> also
encouraged people to patent their
algorithms and release them for free to the Free Software world.
</p><p>
After staying with <span   class="bold"><b>quilt</b></span> for quite a while, <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej
Zolnierkiewicz</b></span>
finally moved the IDE subsystem to a <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>
repository. Apparently, the
various IDE developers had been making noise about preferring git, and
he finally gave in. git has been making steady inroads, although it's
hard to make a real estimate of how many people in the world really
use it. Commercial version control software has a number of features 
that git doesn't yet have, which seem to be high on the
list of priorities for companies considering switching to git. One
feature is the ability to check out only a portion of the repository.
It's one of git's great powers&mdash;letting developers check out the
entire tree and use version control on their local copy, but for some
very large projects, that might not be economical or secure.
Regardless, git works quite well for kernel development, and at least
in the near term, it's unlikely to develop many complex features that
don't directly relate to kernel development.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Banks</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>SGI</b></span> announced that some of its filesystem software
would be coming out under the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL version
2</b></span>. SGI folks apparently had just
taken a batch of code that seemed to have some useful parts and
decided to quit their own work on it and just give it away to
open-source people who could benefit from it. Some of the code
was obviously useful, such as tools designed to put heavy loads on a
given filesystem and detect certain types of corruption, but other
code relies too much on internal SGI infrastructure and would have to
be purged of all that before it really could be useful. In any case,
Greg made it clear that SGI would not be supporting any of the code.

<h2 class="title">at, batch and cron&mdash;the ABCs of Doing Work When Nobody's Home</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #184, August 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
People always have been interested in doing more work with less effort.
This drive reaches its peak when work is being done, even though
you aren't actually doing anything. With Linux, you effectively can do this
with the trio of programs at, batch and cron. So, now your computer can be
busy getting productive work done, long after you've gone home. Most
people have heard of cron. Fewer people have heard of at, and even fewer
have heard of batch. Here, you'll find out what they can do for you, and the
most common options for getting the most out of them.
</p><p>
at is actually a collection of utilities. The basic idea is that you can
create queues of jobs to run on your machine at specified times. The time
at runs your job is specified on the command line, and almost every time
format known to man is accepted. The usual formats, like HH:MM or MM/DD/YY,
are supported. The standard POSIX time format of [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] is
also supported. You even can use words for special times, such as now, noon,
midnight, teatime, today or tomorrow, among others. You also can do
relative dates and times. For example, you could tell at to run your job at
7pm three days from now by using <tt  >7PM + 3 days</tt>.
</p><p>
at listens to the standard input for the commands to run, which you
finish off with a Ctrl-D. You also can place all of the commands to run in
a text file and tell at where to find it by using the command-line option
<tt  >-f filename</tt>. at uses the current directory at the point of invocation
as the working directory.
</p><p>
By default, at dumps all of your jobs into one queue named a. But, you
don't need to stay in that one little bucket. You can group your jobs into
a number of queues quite easily. All you need to do is add the option
<tt  >-q
x</tt> to the at command, where x is a letter. This means you can group
your jobs into 52 queues (a&ndash;z and A&ndash;Z). This lets you use some organization
in managing all your after-hours work. Queues with higher letters will
run with a higher niceness. The special queue, =, is reserved for jobs
currently running.
</p><p>
So, once you've submitted a bunch of jobs, how do you manage them? The
command <tt  >atq</tt> prints the list of your upcoming jobs. The output of
the list is job ID, date, hour, queue and user name. If you've broken up
your jobs into multiple queues, you can get the list of each queue
individually by using the option <tt  >-q x</tt> again. If you change your mind, you
can delete a job from the queue by using the command <tt  >atrm
x</tt>, where x is
the job ID.
</p><p>
Now, what happens if you don't want to overload your box? Using at, your
scheduled job will run at the assigned time, regardless of what else may be
happening. Ideally, you would want your scheduled jobs to run only when
they won't interfere with other work. This is where the batch command comes
in. batch behaves the same way at does, but it will run the job only once the
system load drops below a certain value (usually 1.5). You can change this
value when atd starts up. By using the command-line option <tt  >-l
xx</tt>, you can
tell batch not to run unless the load is below the value xx. Also, batch
defaults to putting your jobs into the queue b.
</p><p>
These tools are great for single runs of jobs, but what happens if you have
a recurring job that needs to run on some sort of schedule? This is where
our last command, cron, comes in. As a user, you actually don't run cron.
You instead run the command crontab, which lets you edit the list of jobs
that cron will run for you. Your crontab entries are lines containing a
time specification and a command to execute. For example, you might have a
backup program running at 1am each day:

<pre     class="programlisting">
0 1 * * *       backup_prog
</pre>
</p><p>
cron accepts a wide variety of time specifications. The fields
available for your crontab entries include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
minute: 0&ndash;59
</p></li><li><p>
hour: 0&ndash;23
</p></li><li><p>
day of month: 1&ndash;31
</p></li><li><p>
month: 1&ndash;12
</p></li><li><p>
day of week: 0&ndash;7
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can use these fields and values directly, use groups of
values separated by commas, use ranges of values or use an asterisk to
represent any value. You also can use special values:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
@reboot: run once, at startup
</p></li><li><p>
@yearly: run once a year (0 0 1 1 *)
</p></li><li><p>
@annually: same as @yearly
</p></li><li><p>
@monthly: run once a month (0 0 1 * *)
</p></li><li><p>
@weekly: run once a week (0 0 * * 0)
</p></li><li><p>
@daily: run once a day (0 0 * * *)
</p></li><li><p>
@midnight: same as @daily
</p></li><li><p>
@hourly: run once an hour (0 * * * *)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now that you have these three utilities under your belt, you can schedule
those backups to run automatically, or start a long compile after
you've gone home, or make your machine use up any idle cycles. So,
go out and get lots of work done, even when nobody is home.

<h2 class="title">Forecast: Cloudy</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #184, August 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the November 2008 UpFront section, we published a little piece describing what
&ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo; really meant. I'm a big fan of cool buzzwords,
but for some reason, &ldquo;The Cloud&rdquo; is a term that always has seemed
unnerving. Don't get me wrong; the concept is great. It's just that
so many companies seem to be touting their new &ldquo;cloud
solution&rdquo;
to entice people with their hipness.
</p><p>
As much as I'd love to see the term change, I think it's here to stay.
And, thanks to Linux, it's going to be quite a contender for replacing
traditional server farms. Companies like Amazon with its EC2 or
Google with its massive numbers of abstracted computer clusters are
proving that Linux is the perfect way to throw serious computing muscle
into large-scale clouds.
</p><p>
Once more, Linux is taking a huge market share and getting little praise
for it. Linux is the premier choice for cloud computing providers,
because it's affordable, scalable and, quite frankly, cheap. Now if only
we can get a different name to stick&mdash;maybe S.H.A.W.N.
(Superior Horsepower Abstracted Windows-lessly in a Network) computing? Yeah,
probably not.

FreeRTOS is an open-source mini-real-time kernel
with preemptive multitasking and coroutines.
It provides queues for intertask communication,
and binary semaphores, counting semaphores, recursive semaphores,
mutexes and mutexes with priority inheritance
for task synchronization.
It can run with as little as 1K bytes of RAM
and 4K bytes of ROM.
</p><p>
FreeRTOS has been ported to 19+ architectures
that include 8-, 16- and 32-bit processors.
The core code is mostly written in C and is compatible
with most C compilers.
The distribution comes with numerous samples
for a number of different development boards.
Many of the samples include an embedded Web server.
</p><p>
FreeRTOS is licensed under a modified GPL such that
it can be used in commercial applications without
the need to release your application source,
as long as you don't modify the core FreeRTOS code.
There also are commercially licensed versions and a
version that has been certified for use in safety-critical applications.

<h2 class="title">Kindle DX&mdash;So Big You'll Want to Fold It</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #184, August 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The Kindle 2 was Amazon's answer to concerns over the shortcomings of
its immensely popular ebook reader. Version 2 improved on the form
factor, usability and many other issues that annoyed users&mdash;everything except the screen size.

</p><p>
That's where the new model, the DX, comes into play. This Kindle boasts
an 8.5 x 11" screen, which is conveniently the same size as standard
US letter paper. The screen rotates, is rumored to have better contrast
and, not to beat a dead horse, it's huge!
Due to the size of the Kindle DX, sideways scrolling for things
like PDF documents will be a thing of the past.
</p><p>
On the downside, the Kindle DX costs almost $500 and was released right on the
heels of the Kindle 2. Those folks who just shelled out $359 for their
shiny (almost) new book reader will be hard-pressed to spend anything, much
less $489, on a device that adds only a larger screen that rotates and
displays PDFs. But, if you were holding out because you thought the
screen was too small, the Kindle DX might be just the ticket for you.
Besides, doesn't we all need another Linux device in our lives?

<h2 class="title">The Rise of the Unconvention</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #184, August 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This past May, I had the privilege of attending Penguicon 7.0 in Detroit,
Michigan,
as a &ldquo;Nifty Guest&rdquo;. It's not a big convention, with a little
more than 
1,000 attendees, and it's not even solely devoted to Linux.
But, that seems to be part of the magic. Although at times it's a bit
unnerving to see people walking around dressed in furry suits (Penguicon
is also a science-fiction convention you see), the mix of people with
varying levels of technical expertise is actually quite refreshing.
</p><p>
It's not terribly often a panel on Linux adoption on the desktop can
be attended by both those familiar with using Linux and those just
curious about it. The ability to bring those folks together so each can
understand the other's viewpoint is truly invaluable. Add to that
some of the geekiest guests, craziest entertainment and all-you-can-drink
Monster energy drinks&mdash;Penguicon really sets itself apart as a
conference that will bring you back year after year. As the entry
fee is less than $50, making that yearly trek isn't even terribly painful
on the pocketbook.
</p><p>
Are the smaller Linux conventions going to take over and grow while
the larger ones start dwindling? I won't say it's going
to happen, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised. As for myself,
I'm going to try getting to the Ohio LinuxFest. If you look around,
you'll probably find one close to you too. And, if not, consider
starting one yourself!
