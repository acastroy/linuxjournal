Looking around, I was confused by the scene. The
operating system (and my desktop), was nowhere to be seen&mdash;and yet,
there it was, everywhere I turned. It was as though the kidnappers had
created countless copies of my desktop OS and left it everywhere for me
to find&mdash;a mystery indeed. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e8580.0x14e0460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What's wrong, Fran&ccedil;ois? You look as though your Linux
desktop has been stolen. It has? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon ami</em></span>, I was just
kidding. I
can see notebooks at every table in the restaurant. It's rather strange for
a thief to take things yet leave them where they are, don't you think?
</p><p>
Ah, I see. My apologies, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. That's my fault. I modified
the workstations so that they would boot directly into Firefox without
loading a desktop. Why? Because it's the perfect way to demonstrate
tonight's feature, and now that I see your reaction, I suppose it does
add an air of mystery. You'll see what I am up to shortly, but for now,
we must get ready. I can see our guests arriving as we speak. Smile,
Fran&ccedil;ois. It's all good.
</p><p>
Good evening, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, the home of
fine wine and superb Linux and open-source software. Your tables are
ready, and my faithful waiter was just getting ready to fetch our featured
wine. Quickly, Fran&ccedil;ois, head to the cellar and bring back the 2005 La
Vigna Vecchia Barbera d'Asti from Italy. Check the North wing for that
one.
</p><p>
While we wait for Fran&ccedil;ois and the wine, allow me to explain the
nonexistent desktops before you. Each workstation has a browser running
as its sole desktop application to demonstrate a very cool cloud-based
open-source desktop that runs from a Linux server.
</p><p>
Richard M. Stallman called cloud computing a trap, saying &ldquo;It's
just as bad as using a proprietary program. Do your own computing on
your own computer with your copy of a freedom-respecting program. If
you use a proprietary program or somebody else's Web server, you're
defenseless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed that
software.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Well, if you find yourself in agreement with old RMS, rest assured
that there's another way to get the benefits of cloud computing without
being tied to Google, Amazon or whatever other Web behemoth might be
trying to get your cloud OS business. The answer is your own private
cloud, courtesy of eyeOS (Figure 1). This is an impressive little
desktop OS you can run from your Linux server. It comes bundled with
small applications, fine-tuned for the Web, to play music files, watch
videos, surf the Web, create documents, chat, play games and a whole lot
more. eyeOS is a free and open package with a commercial company behind
the product as well as an active community of users and developers. It's
a great way to deploy desktops in libraries, schools, for user groups
and in business. It's a thin-client network without the thin-client
hardware. And, it's pretty cool.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f1.large.jpg"><img src="10516f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. How would you
like a screaming-fast desktop, in your own private cloud, accessible
from any Web browser? Meet eyeOS.
</p></div></div><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, good to have you back. Please pour for our guests. You'll
love this one, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. It's deep and complex with a plum and cherry
flavor and a little hint of peppery spiciness. Enjoy.
</p><p>
Getting eyeOS served up on your, ahem, server, is easy&mdash;frightfully
easy in fact. Your Linux server should be up to date and running PHP5
in order to use the latest eyeOS, but there isn't much more to it than
that. Download the latest copy of eyeOS, and find a place for it inside
your Web server's document root. Now, using your Apache user, extract
it with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf eyeOS_1.8.5.0-3.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
The package extracts into a directory called eyeOS, but you
can, of course, change that if you like. If you extract it using the
root user, you need to do a global group and ownership change on that
directory so Apache can write to it. You can make eyeOS its own Web site
or simply place it in an existing Web site tree. Assuming you put eyeOS
in the root of an existing Web site, you might connect using your browser
like this: http://yoursite.dom/eyeOS/index.html. Because this is
your first time accessing eyeOS, you'll be redirected to the installer
(Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f2.large.jpg"><img src="10516f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Installing eyeOS
is a very simple process and doesn't require much typing.
</p></div></div><p>
Notice that the installer is asking you for the root password. That's the
eyeOS root password&mdash;the one that will serve as the master account for
this installation of eyeOS, not the one for your server. Make sure you
select a password for eyeOS specifically. Before you click the Install
eyeOS button, look at the check box directly above. It's labeled Allow
users to create accounts. If you check this, anyone can freely create
an account on the system, without root approval (eyeOS root, that is).
</p><p>
Once you click the Install button, everything happens very quickly, and
you find yourself at the login screen. Congratulations. That's really
all there is to installing eyeOS. You could log in as root here, but let
me show you what happens if you allowed registration and chose to create
a user. Directly below the user name and password information on the login
screen is a New User button (Figure 3). Click the New User
button, and the login screen displays an extended login form where you
define a user name and password of your choosing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f3.large.jpg"><img src="10516f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The login screen serves a dual purpose, allowing new users to 
register an account easily&mdash;if you allow it, of course.
</p></div></div><p>
That's all there is to it. You're ready to log in using the user name and
password you've just created. Once logged in, you'll find yourself at the
eyeOS desktop (Figure 4). Let's take a quick look at how this desktop
is organized. Along the top is a panel referred to as the application
dock. This is your gateway to an impressive collection of built-in
applications (we'll explore some of those applications shortly). The
desktop itself has a handful of icons to access common tools
quickly, such as your calendar, the home folder and so on. To the right, you'll
see a small menu floating on the desktop. Those are mini
actions&mdash;functions that, although they may open an application, aren't applications
per se.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f4.large.jpg"><img src="10516f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Your shiny
new eyeOS desktop, ready to satisfy.
</p></div></div><p>
Along the bottom is another panel, or bar, that shows your running
applications, the date and time (along with a pop-up calendar), and a
small icon that launches a system menu (Figure 5). From here, you
can change your session preferences (the root user gets an enhanced
Preferences dialog&mdash;more on this later), get a list of all installed
applications, find out about eyeOS, launch a program (similar to the
Alt-F2 quick launch in GNOME and KDE) or log out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10516f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The system menu,
the gateway to customizing your session, is right next to the system clock.
</p></div></div><p>
Before I give you a quick tour of applications, let me show you
a little of the Preferences dialog (Figure 6). To change your
personal information and password, this is stop one. It's also the
place to change the look and feel of eyeOS. To change your wallpaper,
click on Desktop, or to use a completely different theme that changes
your window decorations, icons, application dock and more, click on
Theme. Under System, you can change the behavior of the eyeOS board,
a kind of built-in instant-messaging program that lets you communicate
with other users logged in to your eyeOS cloud. Autorun commands are
those that you want to run automatically when you log in. The application
dock and the mini-actions are just two of the programs already in the
Autorun queue. Security is interesting in that you can secure your
personal session by IP address. If you want to make sure that you (or
your user name) can log in only from your personal system, look here.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f6.large.jpg"><img src="10516f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The System
Preferences Dialog for Non-Admin Users
</p></div></div><p>
Let's say you do want to change that wallpaper. You need some
background images first. That brings up the question on everyone's mind, which
is, &ldquo;How to I get files up to this thing?&rdquo; There are a couple
ways to do it,
one being via the mini-tools menu and the other being the file manager. To
upload via the mini-tools, click on Upload your files to bring up the
Upload files dialog (Figure 7). Click the Add files button,
then select files using your system's file selection dialog (Firefox
uses a GTK file dialog, for instance). When you've chosen the file, or
files, you want to upload, click the Upload now! button. One by one,
the files will be uploaded to your eyeOS desktop.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f7.large.jpg"><img src="10516f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Uploading
files is done through the file manager or the desktop mini-tools (shown
here).
</p></div></div><p>
By default, the files will be uploaded to your desktop folder. As
we all know, files and folders aren't always where we want them. Besides, from time to time, you need to do a little cleanup in your
virtual home. The same holds true for the folders in your cloud-based
desktop. Click the Home icon on the desktop to open the file manager
(Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f8.large.jpg"><img src="10516f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The eyeOS
file manager lets you manipulate your data on your virtual desktop as
well as compress and download to your physical desktop.
</p></div></div><p>
I mentioned a couple applications already, one being the eyeOS board
that you can use to chat with other logged-in users. There also are, of
course, the classic can't-do-without applications, namely office tools,
such as a word processor and spreadsheet (Figure 9). Click the Office
link on the eyeOS application dock, and select Word Processor. Although not
as full-featured as OpenOffice.org (which you can install, by the way),
this word processor does read and write Microsoft Word format (aka .doc)
files. There's also a spreadsheet application, an address book and
contact manager, a chat client and more.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f9.large.jpg"><img src="10516f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. eyeOS
even has its own word processor, capable of reading and writing Microsoft
Word format files.
</p></div></div><p>
Although you may not find everything you need right off the bat,
an eyeOS software site lists applications by category, complete
with descriptions, ratings and installation information. This brings
me back around to the whole issue of administration, namely the root user.
</p><p>
If you log in as root, the initial experience is much the same as that
for any other user, but there are important differences as well. Most
of these you will see when you visit the System Preferences tool. For
instance, letting everyone create an account this easily probably
is fine if you are truly running from a private cloud, from inside an
office or on a private network. But, what if you don't want every person
who logs in to have instant access? Under the System Preferences menu,
there's a whole submenu for Administration (Figure 10). Under System
(Permissions tab), you can turn on and off public registration. If you do
so,
you then will create users manually.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10516f10.large.jpg"><img src="10516f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The root
user has additional system control functions, such as controlling the
addition of users, groups, e-mail and so on.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can set a quota for user storage space (the default is
set at 1GB), set up repositories for installing software or
configure your server to send mail from the eyeOS accounts. Perhaps the
most important administrative function you may desire to implement
is OpenOffice.org support. This involves a little server-side Linux
magic to get things going, not the least of which is to install xvfb
and OpenOffice.org. The eyeOS wiki has simple instructions that cover
several Linux distributions, so I invite you to read the note relevant
for your system at the following, friendly URL:
<a href="http://wiki.eyeos.org/Setting_Up_Office_Linux" target="_self">wiki.eyeos.org/Setting_Up_Office_Linux</a>.
</p><p>
Speaking of extra software, pay a visit to the eyeOS community apps
repository at <a href="http://www.eyeos-apps.org" target="_self">www.eyeos-apps.org</a> for a huge list of
additional packages built for eyeOS. And finally, there's an interesting
package (currently in Alpha) that you probably will want to try out. Named
eyeSync, this package allows for automatic, transparent synchronization
of your eyeOS files with your personal computer. It works with Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X Leopard: <a href="http://eyeos.org/en/downloads/eyesync" target="_self">eyeos.org/en/downloads/eyesync</a>.
</p><p>
There you have it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, a cloud-based OS that is completely
open, works well with your existing Linux server and addresses
the issues with closed vendor-controlled clouds. It's easy to let everyone
share your cloud-based desktop, but if you really want people to stay off
of your cloud (unless you want them to, of course), eyeOS provides
the tools to do exactly that. You can have hundreds, even thousands, of
desktops, invisible and yet always there. A final bit of cool is that
if you close down your browser without logging out, you always can come
back to your running eyeOS session to the keystroke where you left off.
</p><p>
Yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it's that time yet again, when we must say goodbye
and return to our respective homes. After tonight, however, your desktop
home can follow you wherever you want&mdash;always with you but not really
there either. Life in the open-source cloud has finally arrived. On
that note, I think it's time to ask that most excellent of waiters,
Fran&ccedil;ois, to refill everyone's glass a final time before we say our
goodbyes to one another. Until next time, please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
raise your glasses and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
