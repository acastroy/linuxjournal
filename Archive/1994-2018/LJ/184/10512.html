LongoMatch&mdash;Sports Video Analysis
(<a href="http://www.ylatuya.es" target="_self">www.ylatuya.es</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I mentioned LongoMatch in last month's Projects at a Glance sidebar, hoping
I could get it to work this month. I assumed it would be tricky
to install, being a video-related project, but much to my surprise and
delight, it installed with very little fuss, and I'm proud to feature it
here this month. According to LongoMatch's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
LongoMatch is a sports video analysis tool for coaches to assist them
in making game video analysis. You can tag the most important plays of
a game and group them by categories to study each detail of game
strategy. A list with all the tagged plays lets you review them with a
simple click, even in slow motion. The timeline gives a quick overview
of the game and lets you adjust the lead and lag time of each play frame
by frame. LongoMatch has support for playlists, an easy way to create
presentations with plays from different games. Besides, you can create
new videos with your favorite plays using the video editing feature.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10512f1.large.jpg"><img src="10512f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
LongoMatch allows you to mark out important parts of a game or any
video.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10512f2.large.jpg"><img src="10512f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
This is Analyze Mode, where you can fine-tune the timing of 
your highlights.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10512f3.large.jpg"><img src="10512f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Despite being designed for sporting matches, LongoMatch can be used to mark
out sections of any video. Here it's being used to mark out a
music concert.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
My hat is off to Andoni Morales who made the entire installation
process pain-free. Head to the download
page, and your choices are repositories to add for Ubuntu (I know this
isn't <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Journal</em></span>, sorry) or a source tarball. If you are an Ubuntu
user, add the repositories mentioned, update apt-get, and select the
package longomatch.
</p><p>
If you're not an Ubuntu user and have to use the source, don't panic,
Andoni has marked out the packages you need: autotools-dev, pkg-config,
mono-gmcs, libdb4o6.0-cil, libgtk2.0-cil, libgstreamer0.10-dev,
libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libmono2.0-cil and
libmono-cairo2.0-cil.
</p><p>
If you use a Debian-based distro, you can use this
command (to be run as root or sudo):

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install autotools-dev pkg-config mono-gmcs 
 &#8618;libdb4o6.0-cil libgtk2.0-cil libgstreamer0.10-dev 
 &#8618;libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libgtk2.0-dev 
 &#8618;libmono2.0-cil libmono-cairo2.0-cil
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the dependencies are out of the way, grab the source tarball,
extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder. Enter the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1789580.0x1881cf8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
# ldconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the source has finished compiling, you can run the program
by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ longomatch
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before starting, you need a video to analyze. Let's assume
it's a sporting video with two teams, but it doesn't have to be (more
on that later). Once inside, you need to start a New Project
under the File menu. The New Project window prompts you to enter the
name of a Local Team and a Visitor Team, the number of each team's
goals, as well as the date of the match. These tools simply
make things easier for a sport that fits this profile&mdash;soccer being the
main example&mdash;but they're not requirements, especially if your sport
doesn't fit these constraints (my sport is rock climbing for instance,
for which video analysis is also very helpful).
</p><p>
Once you've selected your video and are ready to go, LongoMatch
automatically goes to its main screen, Capture Mode, and starts playing
your chosen video. When you want to highlight something, such as a scored
goal, a penalty and so on, click the Pause button. Then,
click the Data 1 button below to note your first bit of information.
If you notice the field on the far left of the screen (where it
also says Data 1, Data 2, Data 3 and so on), you'll see a marking arrow has
been placed next to the name of Data 1. If you double-click on it,
you now can rename it to whatever you want,
such as &ldquo;free kick&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Click the Play button again, and the video plays until the next
event you want to mark. Repeat the steps for Data 1 on the
Data 2 button. From here, you will start to build a timeline of events,
and obviously, you take the same steps for each data point. If you want
to fast-forward or rewind, you can use the slider bar, which is
very handy on tedious junior soccer matches! The vertical slider bar
on the right controls the playback speed, allowing you to slow down
to catch an important Chelsea goal or speed up when you're watching
nine-year-olds play out their enthralling 90 minutes of football.
</p><p>
Once you're finished with the Capture Mode and are ready to
look at what you've marked for analysis, click on the View menu and choose the
Analyze Mode. From here, you can see all the
moments marked out on a timeline. Double-click on any of these marked-out
sections, and LongoMatch takes you straight to that point in the
video.
</p><p>
However, each marked-out point is given a default length that may be
too long or too short for what you want to highlight. Click on the start
or end of a data point's red bar and drag it left or right, which
makes the bar longer or shorter in each section, letting you tighten up
the contents of your highlights. The cool thing is that the video updates
as you slowly drag the bar around, which really helps with accuracy and
pinpointing crucial playback moments.
</p><p>
What I quickly realized with LongoMatch is that it doesn't need to
be used only for sporting analysis. It can be used to analyze any video. If
you simply ignore the prompts at the start in the New Project section,
you can load any video you like and then mark out interesting
points. For instance, I used it to mark out interesting sections of
a music video, which I then can fast-forward to in the Analyze Mode's
timeline section. Getting back to the subject of sports, I can use it
on climbing footage to mark out crucial sections of a route to learn
the moves and study each one individually.
</p><p>
Andoni has made something very useful here that will find an audience
with many coaches and referees, plus it will ease a great deal of stress
for poor dads who've been stuck with the job of highlighting their
kids' sporting matches! As LongoMatch is developed in Mono, it also runs
on Windows, meaning that the audience for this project is potentially
quite broad. It's already getting a following amongst hockey and rugby
teams. And, let's not forget the added bonus that this can be used as a
general video analysis tool as well, which could make it popular with
those who want to use it for multimedia purposes, provided they ignore the sporting features (perhaps a fork is in order,
or an alternative GUI?). I'm interested to see where this goes, in the
likes of The GIMP or Blender it could become a distro mainstay in one
form or another.

Kanatest&mdash;Japanese Flashcard Tool
(<a href="http://www.clayo.org/kanatest" target="_self">www.clayo.org/kanatest</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I was delighted this month to see that Kanatest still is in
development, as it's a tool I've been using for quite some time now, and I
used it to learn Katakana for the first time (part of a Japanese phonetic
alphabet). Recently, there have been improvements and added features,
so I thought I'd jump in and have a look. According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Kanatest is a Japanese kana (Hiragana and Katakana) simple flashcard
tool. During testing, Kanatest displays a randomly selected kana char
(respecting mode and lesson) and waits for the user to answer with the expected romaji
equivalent. This process continues until all questions are answered
or all questions are answered correctly (depends on options). At the
end of the test, a short info page about drilling time and correctness ratio is
displayed. The results are stored, and users can review their performance
at any time. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10512f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Kanatest presents you with a character in Japanese (kana), and
you type it in below in the Roman alphabet.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10512f5.large.jpg"><img src="10512f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Newer features in Kanatest include a character chart.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10512f6.large.jpg"><img src="10512f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Kanatest also includes user-defined lessons.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10512f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
At the end of each test, you are presented with your score and accuracy
rate&mdash;it's been a while since my last lesson, as you can see!
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Although Kanatest is available in a number of repositories, chances
are that it's an old version (at least it was at the time of this writing). I
went with the tarball for the latest features and didn't run into any
pesky requirements during the compilation. To compile it yourself, head
to the Web site, grab the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal
in the new folder.
</p><p>
Compiling Kanatest is the usual case of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it's compiled, you might find it in your menu (mine was under
Applications), or you can start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ kanatest
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once the program has loaded, Kanatest is ready to go with
that tempting Start button on the bottom left, but you might want to
define what kind of lesson you want to run first. If you go with the
defaults, Kanatest tests you on Katakana and goes through all
the characters. If you want to change the lesson, check the drop-down
box called Test mode:, where you can choose between Hiragana, Katakana
and Mixed. And, for those who know what they're doing, under Kana set:,
you can choose from All kanas, Basic kanas, A-I-U-E-O, KA-KI-KU-KE-KO
and so on.
</p><p>
When you're ready to go, click Start. You'll be presented with a screen
that shows Japanese phonetic characters above, with an input box where
you type in what the character says in Romaji (Japanese using the Roman
alphabet). In the middle is a progress bar that shows
how many characters you have to go through, and a timer keeps track for
those wanting to improve their reading and reaction times. When you get
a character wrong on the default settings, the program corrects you,
reading out the proper answer, and tallies your correct answers and
mistakes against the stopwatch at the end.
</p><p>
What's great for advanced students is that you also can be tested
on kana combos such as kyo, ji, kyu and so on. For beginners who have
only seen kana for the first time, don't panic, as there's a kana chart
available on the program's main screen in that cluster of four
buttons on the right. Included in the chart are all the characters in
both Hiragana and Katakana, as well as their combinations, such as pya,
myu and so on.
</p><p>
For those who aren't really into tweaking things and happily accept
defaults, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> recommend checking out the Options section, as
this is where you can choose your wanted characters in a user-defined
lesson. I thoroughly endorse this move, as there's certain characters I
always get confused over, such as Katakana's n, so, shi and tsu. You
also can choose to repeat wrongly answered questions instead of having it
correct you, as well as change colors, fonts and so on.
</p><p>
Check out
the Statistics section too, because here you can keep track of your test
scores over time and see your correctness ratio for each kana
character.
</p><p>
If you're a Japanese-language student and haven't used Kanatest
before, you should do so. It's simple, elegant, painless and probably the
best choice there is for testing yourself against kana. If you have
used Kanatest before, and it's been a while, check the latest releases,
as it really has improved. The user-defined lessons, combined with the
Statistics section in particular, make things much better than before.
