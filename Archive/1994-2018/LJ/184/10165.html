The -rt patchset, or just -rt, adds real-time scheduling
capabilities to the Linux kernel.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19c22a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many market sectors, such as financial trading, defense, industry
automation and gaming, long have had a need for low latencies and
deterministic response time. Traditionally, custom-built hardware and
software were used to meet these real-time requirements. However, for some
soft real-time requirements, where predictability of response times is
advantageous and not mandatory, this is an expensive solution. With the
advent of the PREEMPT_RT patchset, referred to
as -rt henceforth, led by Ingo Molnar, Linux has made great progress
in the world of real-time operating systems for &ldquo;enterprise
real-time&rdquo;
applications. A number of modifications were made to the general-purpose Linux
kernel to make Linux a viable choice for real time, such as the
scheduler, interrupt handling, locking mechanism and so on.
</p><p>
A real-time system is one that provides guaranteed system response times
for events and transactions&mdash;that is, every operation is expected to be
completed within a certain rigid time period. A system is classified
as hard real-time if missed deadlines cause system failure and soft
real-time if the system can tolerate some missed time constraints.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19c2510"></a>
Design Goal</h2></div></div><p>
Real-time systems require that tasks be executed in a strict priority
order. This necessitates that only the N highest-priority tasks be running
at any given point in time, where N is the number of CPUs. A variation to
this requirement could be strict priority-ordered scheduling in a given
subset of CPUs or scheduling domains (explained
later in this article). In both cases, when a task is runnable, the scheduler must ensure
that it be put on a runqueue on which it can be run immediately&mdash;that
is,
the real-time scheduler has to ensure system-wide strict real-time
priority scheduling (SWSRPS). Unlike non-real-time systems where the
scheduler needs to look only at its runqueue of tasks to make scheduling
decisions, a real-time scheduler makes global scheduling decisions, taking
into account all the tasks in the system at any given point. Real-time
task balancing also has to be performed frequently. Task balancing can introduce
cache thrashing and contention for global data (such as runqueue locks)
and can degrade throughput and scalability. A real-time task scheduler would
trade off throughput in favor of correctness, but at the same time, it must ensure
minimal task ping-ponging.
</p><p>
The standard Linux kernel provides two real-time scheduling policies,
SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR. The
main real-time policy is SCHED_FIFO. It
implements a first-in, first-out scheduling algorithm. When a SCHED_FIFO task starts running, it continues to run until
it voluntarily yields the processor, blocks or is preempted by a higher-priority real-time task. It has no timeslices. All other tasks of lower
priority will not be scheduled until it relinquishes the CPU. Two equal-priority SCHED_FIFO tasks do not preempt each
other. SCHED_RR is similar to
SCHED_FIFO, except that such tasks are allotted timeslices
based on their priority and run until they exhaust their timeslice.
Non-real-time tasks use the SCHED_NORMAL
scheduling policy (older kernels had a policy named SCHED_OTHER).
</p><p>
In the standard Linux kernel, real-time priorities range from zero to
(MAX_RT_PRIO-1), inclusive. By default,
MAX_RT_PRIO is 100. Non-real-time tasks have
priorities in the range of MAX_RT_PRIO to
(MAX_RT_PRIO + 40). This constitutes the nice
values of SCHED_NORMAL tasks. By default, the
&ndash;20 to 19 nice range maps directly onto the priority range of 100 to 139.
</p><p>
This article assumes that readers are aware of the basics of a task
scheduler. See Resources for more information about the Linux Completely
Fair Scheduler (CFS).

Overview of the -rt Patchset Scheduling Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>
The real-time scheduler of the -rt patchset adopts an active push-pull
strategy developed by Steven Rostedt and Gregory Haskins for balancing
tasks across CPUs. The scheduler has to address several scenarios:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Where to place a task optimally on wakeup (that is, pre-balance).
</p></li><li><p>
What to do with a lower-priority task when it wakes up but is
on a runqueue running a task of higher priority.
</p></li><li><p>
What to do with a low-priority task when a higher-priority task
on the same runqueue wakes up and preempts it.
</p></li><li><p>
What to do when a task lowers its priority and thereby causes a previously
lower-priority task to have the higher priority.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
A push operation is initiated in cases 2 and 3 above. The push
algorithm considers all the runqueues within its root domain (discussed
later) to find the one that is of a lower priority than the task being
pushed.
</p><p>
A pull operation is performed for case 4 above. Whenever a runqueue
is about to schedule a task that is lower in priority than the previous
one, it checks to see whether it can pull tasks of higher priority from
other runqueues.
</p><p>
Real-time tasks are affected only by the push and pull
operations. The CFS load-balancing algorithm does not handle real-time
tasks at all, as it has been observed that the load balancing pulls real-time
tasks away from runqueues to which they were correctly assigned, inducing
unnecessary latencies.

Important -rt Patchset Scheduler Data Structures and Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
The main per-CPU runqueue data structure struct rq, holds a structure struct rt_rq
that encapsulates information about the real-time tasks placed on the
per-CPU runqueue, as shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19c2e00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. struct rt_rq</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct rt_rq {
    struct rt_prio_array  active;
    ...
    unsigned long         rt_nr_running;
    unsigned long         rt_nr_migratory;
    unsigned long         rt_nr_uninterruptible;
    int                   highest_prio;
    int                   overloaded;
};
</pre></div><p>
Real-time tasks have a priority in the range of 0&ndash;99. These tasks
are organized on a runqueue in a priority-indexed array active, of type
struct rt_prio_array. An
rt_prio_array consists of an array of subqueues.
There is one subqueue per priority level. Each subqueue contains the runnable
real-time tasks at the corresponding priority level. There is also a
bitmask corresponding to the array that is used to determine effectively
the highest-priority task on the runqueue.
</p><p>
rt_nr_running and rt_nr_uninterruptible
are counts of the number of runnable real-time tasks and the number
of tasks in the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state,
respectively.
</p><p>
rt_nr_migratory indicates the number
of tasks on the runqueue that can be migrated to other runqueues. Some
real-time tasks are bound to a specific CPU, such as the kernel thread
softirq-timer. It is quite possible that a number of such affined threads
wake up on a CPU at the same time. For example, the softirq-timer thread
might cause the softirq-sched kernel thread to become active, resulting
in two real-time tasks becoming runnable. This causes the runqueue to be
overloaded with real-time tasks. When overloaded, the real-time scheduler
normally will cause other CPUs to pull tasks. These
tasks, however, cannot be pulled by another CPU because of their CPU
affinity. The other CPUs cannot determine this without the overhead of
locking several data structures. This can be avoided by maintaining
a count of the number of tasks on the runqueue that can be migrated
to other CPUs. When a task is added to a runqueue, the hamming weight
of the task-&gt;cpus_allowed mask is looked at
(cached in task-&gt;rt.nr_cpus_allowed). If the
value is greater than one, the rt_nr_migratory
field of the runqueue is incremented by one. The overloaded
field is set when a runqueue contains more than one real-time
task and at least one of them can be migrated to another runqueue. It is
updated whenever a real-time task is enqueued on a runqueue.
</p><p>
The highest_prio field indicates the
priority of the highest-priority task queued on the runqueue. This may or
may not be the priority of the task currently executing on the runqueue
(the highest-priority task could have just been enqueued on the runqueue
and is pending a schedule). This variable is updated whenever a task
is enqueued on a runqueue. The value of the highest_prio
is used when scanning every runqueue to find the lowest-priority runqueue for pushing a task. If the highest_prio
of the target runqueue is smaller than the task to be
pushed, the task is pushed to that runqueue.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows the values of the above data structures in an example
scenario.

Root Domain</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned before, because the real-time scheduler requires several
global, or system-wide, resources for making scheduling decisions,
scalability bottlenecks appear as the number of CPUs increase (due
to increased contention for the locks protecting these resources). For
instance, in order to find out if the system is overloaded with real-time
tasks&mdash;that is, has more runnable real-time tasks than the number of
CPUs&mdash;it needs to look at the state of all the runqueues. In earlier versions,
a global rt_overload variable was used to
track the status of all the runqueues on a system. This variable would
then be used by the scheduler on every call to the schedule()
routine, thus leading to huge contention.
</p><p>
Recently, several enhancements were made to the scheduler to reduce
the contention for such variables to improve scalability. The concept of
root domains was introduced by Gregory Haskins for this purpose. cpusets
provide a mechanism to partition CPUs into a subset that is used by a
process or a group of processes. Several cpusets could overlap. A cpuset
is called exclusive if no other cpuset contains overlapping CPUs. Each
exclusive cpuset defines an isolated domain (called a root domain) of CPUs
partitioned from other cpusets or CPUs. Information pertaining to every
root domain is stored in struct root_domain,
as shown in Listing 2. These root domains are used to narrow the scope of
the global variables to per-domain variables. Whenever an exclusive cpuset
is created, a new root domain object is created with information from
the member CPUs. By default, a single high-level root domain is created
with all CPUs as members. With the rescoping of the rt_overload
variable, the cache-line bouncing would affect only the
members of a particular domain and not the entire system. All real-time
scheduling decisions are made only within the scope of a root domain.

CPU Priority Management</h2></div></div><p>
CPU Priority Management is an infrastructure also introduced by Gregory
Haskins to make task migration decisions efficient. This code tracks the
priority of every CPU in the system. Every CPU can be in any one of the
following states: INVALID, IDLE, NORMAL, RT1, ... RT99.
</p><p>
CPUs in the INVALID state are not eligible for task routing. The system
maintains this state with a two-dimensional bitmap: one dimension for the different
priority levels and the second for the CPUs in that priority level
(priority of a CPU is equivalent to the rq-&gt;rt.highest_prio). This is
implemented using three arrays, as shown in
Listing 3.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19c3958"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. struct cpupri</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct cpupri {
    struct cpupri_vec  pri_to_cpu[CPUPRI_NR_PRIORITIES];
    long               pri_active[CPUPRI_NR_PRI_WORDS];
    int                cpu_to_pri[NR_CPUS];
};
</pre></div><p>
The pri_active bitmap tracks those
priority levels that contain one or more CPUs. For example, if there
is a CPU at priority 49, pri_active[49+2]=1
(real-time task priorities are mapped to 2&ndash;102 internally in order
to account for priorities INVALID and IDLE), finding the first set bit
of this array would yield the lowest priority that any of the CPUs in
a given cpuset is in.
</p><p>
The field cpu_to_pri indicates the priority of
a CPU.
</p><p>
The field pri_to_cpu yields information about all
the CPUs of a cpuset that are in a particular priority level. This is
encapsulated in struct cpupri_vec, as shown in Listing 4.
</p><p>
Like rt_overload, cpupri also is scoped at the root domain level. Every
exclusive cpuset that comprises a root domain consists of a cpupri
data value.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19ba5b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

    int             count;  /* number of cpus at a priority level */
    cpumask_t       mask;   /* mask of cpus at a priority level */
};
</pre></div><p>
The CPU Priority Management infrastructure is used to find a CPU to which to push a task, as shown
in Listing 5. It should be noted that no locks are taken when the search
is performed.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19ba870"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 5. Finding a CPU to Which to Push a Task</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

int cpupri_find(struct cpupri      *cp,
                struct task_struct *p,
                cpumask_t          *lowest_mask)
{
...
    for_each_cpupri_active(cp-&gt;pri_active, idx) {
        struct cpupri_vec *vec  = &amp;cp-&gt;pri_to_cpu[idx];
        cpumask_t mask;

        if (idx &gt;= task_pri)

        cpus_and(mask, p-&gt;cpus_allowed, vec-&gt;mask);

        if (cpus_empty(mask))

        *lowest_mask = mask;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

</pre></div><p>
If a priority level is non-empty and lower than the priority of the task
being pushed, the lowest_mask is set to the mask corresponding to the
priority level selected. This mask is then used by the push algorithm
to compute the best CPU to which to push the task, based on affinity, topology
and cache characteristics.

Details of the Push Scheduling Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>
As discussed before, in order to ensure SWSRPS, when a low-priority
real-time task gets preempted by a higher one or when a task is woken
up on a runqueue that already has a higher-priority task running on it,
the scheduler needs to search for a suitable target runqueue for the
task. This operation of searching a runqueue and transferring one of its
tasks to another runqueue is called pushing a task.
</p><p>
The push_rt_task() algorithm looks at the
highest-priority non-running runnable real-time task on the runqueue and
considers all the runqueues to find a CPU where it can run.
It searches for a runqueue that is of lower priority&mdash;that is, one where the
currently running task can be preempted by the task that is being pushed.
As explained previously, the CPU Priority
Management infrastructure is used to find a mask of CPUs that have
the lowest-priority runqueues. It is important to select only
the best CPU from among all the candidates. The algorithm gives the
highest priority to the CPU on which the task last executed, as it is
likely to be cache-hot in that location. If that is not possible, the
sched_domain map is considered to find a CPU
that is logically closest to last_cpu. If
this too fails, a CPU is selected at random from the mask.
</p><p>
The push operation is performed until a real-time task fails to be
migrated or there are no more tasks to be pushed. Because the algorithm
always selects the highest non-running task for pushing, the assumption
is that, if it cannot migrate it, then most likely the lower real-time
tasks cannot be migrated either and the search is aborted. No lock is
taken when scanning for the lowest-priority runqueue. When the target
runqueue is found, only the lock of that runqueue is taken, after which
a check is made to verify whether it is still a candidate to which to push the task
(as the target runqueue might have been modified by a parallel scheduling
operation on another CPU). If not, the search is repeated for a maximum
of three tries, after which it is aborted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19bac90"></a>
Details of the Pull Scheduling Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>
The pull_rt_task() algorithm looks at all
the overloaded runqueues in a root domain and checks whether they have a
real-time task that can run on the target runqueue (that is, the target CPU is in the
task-&gt;cpus_allowed_mask) and is of a priority
higher than the task the target runqueue is about to schedule. If so,
the task is queued on the target runqueue. This search aborts only after
scanning all the overloaded runqueues in the root domain. Thus, the pull
operation may pull more than one task to the target runqueue. If the
algorithm only selects a candidate task to be pulled in the first pass and
then performs the actual pull in the second pass, there is a possibility
that the selected highest-priority task is no longer a candidate (due
to another parallel scheduling operation on another CPU). To avoid this
race between finding the highest-priority runqueue and having that still
be the highest-priority task on the runqueue when the actual pull is
performed, the pull operation continues to pull tasks. In the worst case,
this might lead to a number of tasks being pulled to the target runqueue,
which would later get pushed off to other CPUs, leading to task bouncing.
Task bouncing is known to be a rare occurrence.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ca580.0x19bad98"></a>
Scheduling Example</h2></div></div><p>
Consider the scenario shown in Figure 2. Task T2 is being preempted by task T3
being woken on runqueue 0. Similarly, task T7 is voluntarily yielding
CPU 3 to task T6 on runqueue 3. We first consider the scheduling action
on CPU 0 followed by CPU 3. Also, assume all the CPUs are in the same root
domain. The pri_active bitmap for this system
of CPUs will look like Figure 3. The numbers in the brackets indicate
the actual priority that is offset by two (as explained earlier).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10165f2.large.jpg"><img src="10165f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 3. Per-sched Domain cpupri.pri_active Array before the Push Operation
</p></div></div><p>
On CPU 0, the post-schedule algorithm would find the runqueue under
real-time overload. It then would initiate a push operation. The first
set bit of pri_active yields runqueue of CPU 1
as the lowest-priority runqueue suitable for task T2 to be pushed to
(assuming all the tasks being considered are not affined to a subset of
CPUs). Once T2 is pushed over, the push algorithm then would try to push
T1, because after pushing T2, the runqueue still would be under RT overload. The
pri_active after the first operation would be
as shown in Figure 4. Because the lowest-priority runqueue has a priority
greater than the task to be pushed (T1 of priority 85), the push aborts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10165f4.large.jpg"><img src="10165f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Per-sched Domain cpupri.pri_active Array after the Push Operation
</p></div></div><p>
Now, consider scheduling at CPU 3, where the current task of priority 92
is voluntarily giving up the CPU. The next task in the queue is T6. The
pre-schedule routine would determine that the priority of the runqueue is
being lowered, triggering the pull algorithm. Only runqueues 0 and 1 being
under real-time overload would be considered by the pull routine. From
runqueue 0, the next highest-priority task T1 is of priority greater than
the task to be scheduled&mdash;T6, and because T1 &lt; T3 and T6 &lt; T3, T1 is
pulled over to runqueue 3. The pull does not abort here, as runqueue 1 is
still under overload, and there are chances of a higher-priority task being
pulled over. The next highest task, T4 on runqueue 1, also can be pulled
over, as its priority is higher than the highest priority on runqueue
3. The pull now aborts, as there are no more overloaded runqueues. The
final status of all the runqueues is as shown in Figure 5, which is
in accordance with scheduling requirements on real-time systems.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10165f5.large.jpg"><img src="10165f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Runqueues after the Push and Pull Operations
</p></div></div><p>
Although strict priority scheduling has been achieved,
runqueue 3 is in an overloaded state due to the pull operation. This
scenario is very rare; however, the community is working on a solution. 
</p><p>
A number of locking-related decisions have to be made by the
scheduler. The state of the runqueues would vary from the above
example, depending on when the scheduling operation is performed on the
runqueues. The above example has been simplified for this explanation.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
The most important goal of a real-time kernel scheduler is to ensure
SWSRPS. The scheduler in the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel uses push
and pull algorithms to balance and correctly distribute real-time tasks
across the system. Both the push and pull operations try to ensure that
a real-time task gets an opportunity to run as soon as possible. Also,
in order to reduce the performance and scalability impact that might
result from increased contention of global variables, the scheduler uses
the concept of root domains and CPU priority management. The scope of
the global variables is reduced to a subset of CPUs as opposed to the
entire system, resulting in significant reduction of cache penalties
and performance improvement.
