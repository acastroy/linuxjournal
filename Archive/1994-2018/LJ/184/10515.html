Use factories and fixtures in your Rails applications to help
simplify your database-related testing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the points of pride in the Ruby community is the degree to
which developers are focused on testing. As I wrote last month, tests
in a dynamic language have more potential to correct more errors and
keep your code trim and functional than even the best compliers.
Rails developers are used to working with three different types of
tests: unit (for database models), functional (for controller
classes) and integration (for testing things from a user's
perspective). Combined with coverage and analysis tools, such as the
metric_fu gem I described last month, these tests can help
ensure that your code is as solid as possible before it is seen by the
general public.
</p><p>
Testing your code requires that you provide it with inputs and that
you then match those inputs with expected outputs. When it comes to a
Web application, those inputs most likely will come from either a
relational database or from a user's form submission. Testing form
submissions is not particularly difficult, especially in a framework
such as Rails, which has extensive testing support built in. Testing
data that comes from a database, however, can be a bit more
challenging, because it means that you must somehow store the data in
the database so that the tests can access it.
</p><p>
One possible solution, of course, is to pre-populate the
database tables with test data directly. But, as simple and obvious as that
solution might appear at first glance, it assumes that you have a
source from which you can pre-populate the database. You could do
it by hand, but then you'll find that any modifications your
program makes to the database&mdash;creating, updating and deleting
rows&mdash;either will stay in effect for the next test or will need to be
reloaded from scratch from another source.
</p><p>
In other words, you need a way to put the test database into a known
state before you begin your tests. If you know this beginning state,
you can write tests that check subsequent states.
</p><p>
The question is, how do you create that initial state? From the time
that Rails was first released, the answer was fixtures&mdash;text files
containing YAML-formatted hand-crafted data. Fixtures are nice, but
as a number of Rails developers have written over the years, they can
be hard to write, hard to keep track of and generally brittle.
</p><p>
This month, I take a look at the current state of loading data into a test
database. I start by examining fixtures, exploring some ways
you still might be able to make them useful inside your
tests. Then, I cover a newer approach to test data, known as
factories, looking at the Factory Girl gem and then taking a
quick peek at the Machinist gem, both of which are in widespread use
among Rails developers and might be a better fit than plain-old
fixtures for your project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6720"></a>
Creating Your Application</h2></div></div><p>
Fixtures, as I mentioned above, are YAML files containing data that
can be loaded into a database. Rails actually allows you to put your
fixture data in formats other than YAML, such as CSV. However, my
guess is that CSV is mostly unused, and that YAML is the format used
by almost everyone working with fixtures.
</p><p>
I created a simple Rails application (using SQLite) on my computer with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails --database=sqlite3 appointments
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I generated a RESTful resource for people:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate scaffold person \
      first_name:string last_name:string email:string
</pre>
</p><p>
This not only created a model for working with people, but also a
controller for handling the basic RESTful functions, views for all of
those controller actions, a database migration that uses Ruby to
describe my model and even some rudimentary tests. I can import the
database migrations with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
And, voil&agrave;! I now have a working application that allows me to add,
delete, modify and list a bunch of people. You might have noticed
that I named my Rails application appointments. My plan is to create
a very simple appointment calendar, so that I can keep track of with
whom I'll be meeting. So, I create another resource, named
meetings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate scaffold meeting \
      starting_at:timestamp ending_at:timestamp location:text
</pre>
</p><p>
(It should go without saying that if I were creating this for real, I
would not store the location as a text field, but rather as an ID
pointing to another table of locations. Keeping data in such
normalized form, so that the text appears in a single place and
is referred to from elsewhere in the database using foreign keys,
makes the application more robust, as well as more efficient.)
</p><p>
Finally, I create a third table, meeting_person, which allows one
or more people to have a meeting. If I were willing to restrict
appointments to a single participant (or two participants, if I
include the person using this software), I simply could have a
person_id field in the meeting table. To get this, I create a new model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model meeting_person \
      person_id:integer meeting_id:integer
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that the three models are in place, I can add associations&mdash;those
declarations in the model classes that link them to one another.
While I'm editing the model, I also will add some validations,
which ensure that the data fits my standards. The final version of
the models is shown in Listing 1. Perhaps the only particularly interesting
part of the models is the custom validation that I placed in the
Meeting model:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def validate
  if starting_at &gt; ending_at
    errors.add_to_base("Starting time is later than ending time!")
  end
end
</pre>

   &lt;%= select("person",
              "person_id",
              Person.all.collect { |p| [p.fullname, p.id] },

&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= link_to 'Back', meetings_path %&gt;

</pre></div><p>
I also created a convenience function that returns an array of names
with whom the appointment will be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def people_as_sentence
  return self.people.map {|p| p.fullname}.to_sentence
end
</pre>
</p><p>
This validation, which is run whenever I try to save an instance of
Meeting, checks to make sure that the starting time is earlier than
the ending time. If this is not the case, the validation fails,
and the data is not stored. (The fact that I can treat times as
full-fledged objects, with access to the &gt; and &lt; operators, is one of
my favorite parts of both Ruby and SQL.)
</p><p>
Finally, I'm going to enhance this application by modifying the
existing scaffolded controller actions to be more useful. First, I
modify the new and create actions, such that they will allow
someone to create an appointment, simultaneously indicating the person
or people with whom the appointment will take place. Then, I
modify the index action, so that the user will get a list of all
upcoming appointments.

Fixtures</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've created a simple application, the time has come to
test it. As I wrote above, testing the application requires that I
have some sample data with which to test it. By default, the
generators for Rails models create basic fixtures, which have long
been the standard way to import data into Rails tests. By basic, I
mean that they contain some very, very basic data&mdash;too basic,
actually, for any real testing I might want to do. For example,
here is the automatically generated fixture for people:

<pre     class="programlisting">
one:
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  email: MyString

two:
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  email: MyString
</pre>
</p><p>
Even if you are new to reading YAML, let alone fixture files, the
format should be easy enough to understand. YAML consists of
name-value pairs within a hierarchy, and indentation indicates where
in the hierarchy a particular name-value pair exists. (You also
can associate a list of values with the key, by separating values with
commas.) Thus, there are two people defined in the
fixture, one and two, and each has three name-value pairs.
</p><p>
However, these name-value pairs are close to useless. They might
contain valid data, or they might contain data that fails to adhere to
the standards laid out in my model validations. If I had defined a
validator for the email field, ensuring that the field always
would contain a valid e-mail address, the tests would fail right away,
before they even ran. Rails would load the fixtures into ActiveRecord,
the database would reject them as being invalid and
I'd be left scratching my head.
</p><p>
Things get even hairier when you start to make fixtures that depend on
associations. I obviously want my meeting_people fixtures to point
to valid people and meetings, but using the numeric IDs can get
confusing very quickly. Fortunately, recent versions of Rails allow
me to name the fixture to which an object is associated, rather than
its numeric ID. Thus, although the default fixtures for meeting_people is
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
one:
  person_id: 1
  meeting_id: 1

two:
  person_id: 1
  meeting_id: 1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b7590"></a></h2></div></div><p>
instead, I can say this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
one:
  person: one
  meeting: one

two:
  person: two
  meeting: two
</pre>
</p><p>
Obviously, you would want to choose more descriptive names for your
fixtures. But, I now have indicated that meeting #1 is with person
#1, and meeting #2 is with person #2. This is obviously more
descriptive than the simple numbers would be.
</p><p>
You can even do one better than this, because fixtures understand the
has_many :through associations that I defined in the models. Just as
in the Ruby code, I can add a person to a meeting with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

meeting.people &lt;&lt; a_person

</pre>
</p><p>
I can put the same sorts of information in the fixture file. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
one:
  starting_at: 2009-05-10 00:48:12
  ending_at: 2009-05-10 01:48:12
  location: MyText
  people: one, two
two:
  starting_at: 2009-05-10 00:48:12
  ending_at: 2009-05-10 01:48:12
  location: MyText
  people: two
</pre>
</p><p>
If you do things this way, you don't want to define things in both the
meeting_people fixture and in the meetings fixture. Otherwise, you
might be in for some very strange errors. Note that fixture files are
ERb (embedded Ruby) files, so you can have dynamically generated
entries, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

one:
  starting_at: &lt;%= 5.minutes.ago %&gt;
  ending_at: &lt;%= Time.now %&gt;
  location: MyText
  people: one, two

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, how do you use these fixtures in your tests? It's actually
pretty straightforward. You need to load the fixtures you want with
the fixtures method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fixtures :meetings
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, all fixtures are imported, thanks to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fixtures :all
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b7ab8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in test/test_helper.rb, which is imported automatically into all
tests. Then, in your test, you can say something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get :edit, :id =&gt; people(:one).id
</pre>
</p><p>
This example (of a functional test) will load the person object
identified as one in people.yml, invoking the edit method and
passing it the ID of the appropriate fixture.

Factory Girl</h2></div></div><p>
For a small site, or when you can keep everything in your head,
fixtures are just fine. I've certainly used them over the years, and
I've found them to be an invaluable part of my testing strategy. But,
factories are an alternative to fixtures that have become increasingly
popular, both because they're written in Ruby code, and they
allow you to do all sorts of things that are difficult or impossible
with YAML fixtures.
</p><p>
Factory Girl is one of the best known factories, written and
distributed by the Thoughtbot company, and it is available as
a Ruby gem. After installing Factory Girl on your system and bringing
it into your application's environment with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.gem "thoughtbot-factory_girl",
             :lib    =&gt; "factory_girl",
             :source =&gt; "http://gems.github.com"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13ae6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in config/environment.rb, you will be able to use it. Basically,
Factory Girl allows you to create objects in Ruby, rather than load
them from fixture files. No defaults are created for you by the
generator, but that's not a big deal, given how easy it is to use
Factory Girl to create test objects.
</p><p>
Above, I showed how in a test environment using fixtures, you can
grab the person object with a name of one by using the people
method, and then passing a symbol:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get :edit, :id =&gt; people(:one).id
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >people(:one)</tt> is a full-fledged ActiveRecord object, with everything
you might expect from such an object. Factory Girl works in a
different way. First, you need to create a test/factories.rb
file, in which your factories are defined. (You also may create a
test/factories/ directory, the contents of which will be Ruby files
defining factories.)
</p><p>
To create a factory for people (that is, in place of people.yml),
insert people.rb inside test/factories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Factory.define :person do |p|
  p.first_name 'Reuven'
  p.last_name  'Lerner'
  p.email 'reuven@lerner.co.il'
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, inside the tests, you can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get :edit, :id =&gt; Factory.build(:person).id
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13aead8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
person = Factory.build(:person)
get :edit, :id =&gt; person.id
</pre>
</p><p>
At first glance, this doesn't seem too exciting. After all, you could
have done roughly the same thing with your fixture, right? But
factories allow you to override the defaults:



<pre     class="programlisting">
person = Factory.build(:person, :first_name =&gt; 'Foobar')
get :edit, :id =&gt; person.id
</pre>
</p><p>
But wait, there's more. You can set associations as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Factory.define :person do |p|
  p.first_name 'Reuven'
  p.last_name  'Lerner'
  p.email 'reuven@lerner.co.il'
  p.meetings {|meetings| meetings.association(:meeting)}
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, if you have created a meeting factory, you can
incorporate it into your person factory, taking advantage of the
association, using a fairly natural syntax.
</p><p>
An even more interesting idea is that of sequences. If your
application needs to create a large number of test people, you
might want each of those people to have a unique e-mail address.
(Never mind that the e-mail never will be sent.) You can do this
with a sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Factory.define :person do |p|
  p.first_name 'Reuven'
  p.last_name  'Lerner'
  p.sequence(:email) {|n| "person#{n}@example.com" }
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The first person created with this factory will have an e-mail
address of person1@example.com; the second will be
person2@example.com and so forth.
</p><p>
As you can see, Factory Girl is as easy to use as YAML fixtures, but
it offers a great many capabilities that come in handy when testing Rails
applications.
</p><p>
Factory Girl is a terrific library for factories, and it has become quite
popular since it was first released. But, not everyone liked its basic
syntax, and one of those people was Pete Yandell, who decided that
although the basic idea behind factories was sound, he wanted to use a
different (and more compact) syntax for his factories. Thus was born
Machinist, which uses a Sham object to describe fields in an object,
which are then assembled into blueprints for specific objects. For
example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'faker'

# Define the fields that we will need
Sham.first_name  { Faker::Name.first_name }
Sham.last_name  { Faker::Name.last_name }
Sham.email { Faker::Internet.email }

# Now use these field definitions to create a blueprint
Person.blueprint do
  first_name
  last_name
  email
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can use these blueprints to create test objects. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
person = Person.make()
</pre>
</p><p>
As with Factory Girl, you also can override the defaults:

<pre     class="programlisting">
person = Person.make(:email =&gt; 'foo@example.com')
</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Fixtures have been a part of Rails testing practices since the
beginning, and they still can be quite useful. But, if you're finding
yourself frustrated by YAML files, or if you want to experiment with
something that offers more flexibility and features, you might well
want to try looking into factories. This month, I looked at two
different libraries for creating Rails factories, both of which are in
popular use and might be a good fit for your project.
