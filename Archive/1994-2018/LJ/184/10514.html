I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and
self-contained,
I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.
</p><p>
They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
No one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning
things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years
ago,
Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.
</p><p>
&mdash;Walt Whitman

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2691460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the second time in six months, our house has been threatened by
wildfire&mdash;the city's third in less than a year. That threat continues right
now, and it's so absorbing that I have no choice but to write about
it&mdash;or about a subject close enough to serve our purposes here.
</p><p>
Our house is in Santa Barbara, a town that exists by temporary exception to
the vicissitudes of nature. Soil studies show that it has burned 
about four times per century, going back to the Pleistocene. Earthquakes
violent enough to level rock walls occur on an average of every
75 years. Tsunamis average once every 500 years. The
last was in 1812, along with an earthquake that leveled the city's famous
mission, for the first of several times. All of this means that people
putting a city in this place is a bit like ants building a nest in a
footpath.
</p><p>
Yet we do. Ambition and industry in the face of inevitable destruction is
the job of life. So I'm not in full agreement with Whitman on that one. Nor
do I agree with other assertions in that passage. But, the line I chose for
the title always has hit home for me.
</p><p>
I believe in ownership&mdash;not for economic reasons, but because possession is
9/10ths of the three-year-old. We are all still toddlers in more ways than
we'd like to admit&mdash;especially when it comes to possessions.
</p><p>
We are grabby animals. We like to own stuff&mdash;or at least control it.
Where would a three-year-old be without the first-person possessive
pronoun? No response is more human than &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; And yet possessions are
also burdens. I have a friend whose childhood home was burned twice by the
same nutcase. He's one of the sanest people I know. I can't say it's because
he has been relieved of archives and other non-negotiables, but it makes a
kind of sense to me. I have tons of that stuff, and I've thought lately
about what it would mean if suddenly they were all cremated. Would that
really be all bad? What I'd miss most are old photos that haven't been
scanned and writing that hasn't been digitized in some way. But is my
digital stuff all that safe either?
</p><p>
I just figured that I have about 4TB of digital stuff. Eliminate
duplicate files and I'd guess the sum goes down to about 600GB. Most of
those are photos. Now that big drives are cheap, I have backups of backups.
Some are here in Boston (where we have what our kid calls
&ldquo;alt.home&rdquo; or
&ldquo;shift_home&rdquo;). Some are back in Santa Barbara. None are safe from fire or
theft.
</p><p>
I've just started backing them up &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;. But how safe is that? Or
secure? Companies are temporary. Servers are temporary. Hell, everything is
temporary.
</p><p>
When I was young, I acknowledged death as part of the cycle of life. Now I
think it's the other way around. Life is part of the cycle of death. Life
generates fuel for death. It's a carbon-based refinery for lots of
interesting and helpful stuff.
</p><p>
Think about it. Marble. Limestone. Travertine. Oil. Gas. Coal. Wood.
Linoleum. Cement. Paint. Plastics. Paper. Asphalt. Textiles. Medicines.
Even the heat used to smelt iron and shape glass comes mostly from burning
fossil fuel. The moon has abundant aluminum ores. But how would you produce
the heat required for extraction, or do anything without the combustive
assistance of oxygen? Ninety-eight percent of the oxygen in Earth's
atmosphere is produced by plants. Most of the sources are now dead, their
energies devoted to post-living purposes.
</p><p>
The Internet grows by an odd noospheric process: duplication. In &ldquo;Better
Than Free&rdquo;, Kevin Kelly makes an observation so profound and obvious that
you can't shake it once it sinks in: &ldquo;The Internet is a copy
machine.&rdquo; As a
result, the Net is turning into what Bob Frankston calls a &ldquo;sea of
bits&rdquo;.
This too is an ecosystem of sorts. Is it, like Earth's ecosystem, a way
that death makes use of life? I wonder about that too.
</p><p>
This fire brings home an observation made by my son Allen way back in 2003:
that a live Web feeds the static one. We see this now with Twitter. I use a
Greasemonkey script to make Twitter search results appear atop my Google
searches. Thanks to these, tweets appear in Google searches an instant
after they are posted. Thanks to tweeting, I rely on a long tail of
interested parties to keep me up on #jesusitafire. Many of these tweets
point to other live Web postings of immediate interest. In time, most of
these scroll to the static Web of archival material that comprises most of
what you find on Google. The live Web is a system of rivers feeding the sea
of bits. That too is a source of life. It is dead stuff that feeds the
noosphere's cerebrum, which in turn produces more of it.
</p><p>
In life, each of us takes what we brought. What we leave is what matters to
the rest of us.
