The long-awaited upgrade to KOffice has arrived.
It looks good and provides a great base for its
future evolution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd3580.0x20cb2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More than a year after KDE 4.0 unveiled a radically revised desktop,
KOffice 2.0 is preparing to release an equally revised office suite, which
should be released before this article is published (KOffice 2.0-RC-1
was released in April 2009). 
</p><p>
What users will see is not an extensive new feature set, but only a few
additions here and there. Instead, just as KDE 4.0 provided the foundation
for future developments on the desktop, KOffice promises to provide a
solid basis for future improvements. Reflecting changes in the toolkit
and library, the newest version of KOffice delivers a common interface
across applications, enhanced graphical capacities and new accessibility
to existing tools&mdash;all wrapped up in a look and feel proving that
eye candy can be as much about usability and functionality as about
superficial aesthetics. These changes are especially visible in major
applications like KWord, KSpread, KPresenter, and Krita and Karbon14
(the main graphics programs), although they are evident in other KOffice
applications as well.
</p><p>
This emphasis means that those who were hoping KOffice 2.0 would
finally allow the office suite to match the rival OpenOffice.org feature
for feature are going to be disappointed. If the late beta I am working
from is a guide, KPresenter still will not have the ability to
use sound or video, and KSpread will continue to lack filters and pivot
tables. In fact, some features of KOffice 1.6.3, the previous official
release, such as comments and expressions (autotext) in KWord or tables
in KPresenter, may not find their way into KOffice 2.0 either. When you
do find new features, they are apt to be fundamental ones, such as more
printing options for KSpread.
</p><p>
However, this focus does not mean KOffice is lacking in scope. By
any standard, KOffice 2.0 is an ambitious undertaking. With 11
applications to OpenOffice.org's six, and a considerably worse ratio of
programmers, any release of KOffice is an exercise in logistics second
only to a new version of KDE itself&mdash;and version 2.0 is more challenging
than most releases. The new release not only marks KOffice's transition
to the Qt 4.x toolkit, like most KDE-related software, but also new ports to
OS X and Windows.
</p><p>
If that were not enough, version 2.0 also marks the first use of two
major libraries: Flake, which introduces a new concept of shapes,
together with tools to manage them; and Pigment, a color management
library. No wonder, then, that the release is happening 16 months
after the KDE 4.0 release and has staggered through ten alpha and seven
beta releases. But, when KOffice 2.0 finally reaches release, the result
promises to be a revamping that will allow the project developers to
add smaller enhancements in point releases.

Introducing the Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Like the KDE 3.0 series, KOffice 1.6.3 is functional but easy to
underestimate, because it looks like a refugee from the late 1990s. By
contrast, KOffice 2.0 looks as though it is designed to ensure that
nobody ever will dismiss it solely on the basis of appearance.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10518f1.large.jpg"><img src="10518f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. KOffice 2.0 introduces an
eye-catching but highly functional interface.
</p></div></div><p>
Ever since Microsoft Office 2007 replaced menus and toolbars with
ribbons, rival office suites have been faced with the dilemma of
either copying and looking modern or retaining the functionality of
traditional program design and looking out of date. OpenOffice.org 3.0
met the challenge with a compromise that kept the traditional structure
but increased the number of floating palettes or windows&mdash;selections
of tools that could be positioned anywhere on the desktop or docked
in the toolbar or against one side of the editing window. In version
2.0, KOffice's developers have opted for a similar solution, calling
them dockers and adding controls for turning each one on or off in the
Settings menu.
</p><p>
Dockers are accompanied by two panes to either side of the editing
window. On the left is a pane with icons specific to the application. On
the right is the pane containing multiple dockers. Click on an icon in
the application pane, and the available dockers on the right change. The
application pane, the docker pane or any individual docker can be
removed from its position to float freely by dragging its title bar
with the mouse. You also can drag dockers into different positions on
the right-hand pane.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10518f3.large.jpg"><img src="10518f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Dockers, toolbars and panes can all be unmoored
from their positions to float freely.
</p></div></div><p>
Alternatively, you can close panes, toolbars or dockers, or change the
horizontal space given to the docker pane. Unless you are working with
a maximized window on a wide-screen monitor, sooner or later, you 
probably will want to use these customizations to give yourself room to work.
</p><p>
Possibly too, you might want to reduce the number of dockers, especially
when you are first learning KOffice 2.0. Otherwise, the effect is like
sitting down in the cockpit of a commercial airliner and trying not to
be overwhelmed by the dozens of controls available.
</p><p>
The success of this interface varies with the application and your use
of it. The layout works best in feature-rich programs, such as Krita
and Karbon14, where they increase the accessibility of tools (although
at first you might find yourself peering anxiously as you wait for
the mouse-over text to tell you what each icon does). In fact, both
these graphics programs actually have had a very similar arrangement
in earlier releases, which may be where the design originated. But in
KSpread, it might seem like worthless clutter, because many of the dockers
have to do with graphics or layout, neither of which many spreadsheets
need. Similarly, if your word processing never extends beyond a memo,
you might find that the default docker pane is overkill. The same is
true in KPresenter if you don't do original diagrams.
</p><p>
Still, despite their initially formidable appearance, these panes and
dockers do have the advantage of removing many tools from their hiding
places in the menu and placing them where users can become curious and
investigate them. You may find yourself learning more about KOffice
applications than ever before, simply because you can see more of the
possibilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd3580.0x20cbe58"></a>
Enhanced Graphical Capacity</h2></div></div><p>
Just as the Drawing toolbar added increased graphic capacity to the major
OpenOffice.org applications, so dockers give KOffice applications more
ability to handle pictures and primitives.
</p><p>
Some of this enhanced capacity is new, such as the calligraphy tool
that resembles Inkscape's, or the availability of artistic text&mdash;graphical text that can follow angled or curving baselines. Similarly,
the addition of ties or connectors gives KPresenter a large boost by
adding the ability to create and manipulate organizational charts.
</p><p>
However, a good deal of the across-the-board graphical capacity is simply
a reordering of existing tools to make them more accessible. For example,
from the Add Shapes docker, you can not only select basic shapes, such
as ties, chart, artistic text and text frames, but also choose from
a miniature clip-art gallery that includes arrows, geometric shapes
and callouts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10518f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Add Shape docker not only makes economical
use of space, but also makes clear that everything you add to a document is
treated the same way.
</p></div></div><p>
The vaguely named Styles docker provides a similar capacity for the
backgrounds of objects. In a docker that is maybe 2" x .5" high on
my laptop screen, the Styles docker gives you a selection of background
colors, gradients, patterns and fills, or lets you remove them with a click
of a button. These choices can be customized by selecting tools on the
application pane, or sometimes, by making selections in other dockers.
</p><p>
As a side benefit, by having these graphical tools in most applications,
KOffice also increases its common interface. The result is that both
the applications in general and their new graphical capabilities in
particular are quick to learn.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd3580.0x20cc2d0"></a>
Making Old Concepts Clearer</h2></div></div><p>
Another advantage of KOffice 2.0's interface is that basic concepts
often become clearer. This change is especially obvious in KWord.
</p><p>
In 1.6.3, the latest officially released version, KWord's frame tools
provided a tree view of document structure rather like the OpenOffice.org
Navigator. However, this view was locked in place and too narrow by
default even when KWord was maximized. Nor were the arcane icons for
different types of objects beside the tree view very helpful to users. As
a result, most users I have talked to ignore them. Many confess to hiding
the tree view to avoid being intimidated by them.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10518f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The document structure pane in earlier versions
of KOffice confused as much as it enlightened. It's been replaced by
dockers such as Add Shape.
</p></div></div><p>
Now, in KOffice 2.0, the concept of frames has been replaced with the
less abstract and better-labeled ones of shapes&mdash;no doubt as a result
of implementing the new Flake library. As in earlier releases, you still
have to select a type then drag with the mouse in the editing window to
create it, but now, with the default set of dockers, you are more likely
to notice and use the tool.
</p><p>
Moreover, once you have created an object, you easily can use dockers
like Geometry and Snapping to align and orient a shape or arrange it
on a grid. Although the functionality is the same as in earlier releases,
ease of use is far higher.
</p><p>
Just as important, because Add Shapes lists ties, charts, artistic
text and pictures as possible selections, it reinforces the fact that
all these possibilities are essentially the same kind of object so far
as KOffice is concerned, and all can be manipulated in much the same
way in the editing window. In other words, the Add Shapes docker makes
clear a unifying concept in a way that separate sub-items in a menu or
a collection of unconnected icons could never hope to match.
</p><p>
A second basic concept that becomes clearer in KOffice 2.0 is styles&mdash;the formatting equivalent of declaring a variable once and reusing it as
needed. Most word processors have the concept of character and paragraph
styles, but they vary widely in their emphasis on them. For instance,
AbiWord and MS Office tend to make manual formatting more prominent,
while OpenOffice.org requires the use of styles if you want to use many
advanced features. In the past, KOffice has been closer to AbiWord than
OpenOffice.org, including styles, but keeping them in the menus where they
can be missed and their features buried several layers below the top menu.
</p><p>
By contrast, KOffice 2.0 edges closer to emphasizing styles. If you select
the text tool from KWord's application pane, you have a Styles docker (not
to be confused with the one for backgrounds that uses the same name) that
places manual formatting of text and styles only a tab apart. At first,
this arrangement might seem to give both approaches to formatting equal
weight, but the truth is that styles have been so underemphasized that, just
by making them more prominent, the Styles docker increases the chances
that users will investigate the time-saving possibilities of working
with styles. At the same time, unlike in OpenOffice.org, KOffice 2.0 does
not compel users to switch from manual formatting if they choose not to.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd3580.0x20cc7f8"></a>
The Possible Reception</h2></div></div><p>
KOffice 2.0 does have new features that stand on their own, such as
additional functions for KSpread and the option to encrypt files while
saving them. However, such enhancements seem minor compared to those in
the interface. While altering KOffice under the hood, its development
team also has made serious efforts to enhance the interface&mdash;so much
so that the user experience is almost completely different in 2.0 from
that of earlier releases.
</p><p>
Some of these changes work better than others. In particular, some of
the names could be better chosen, at least in English. Apart from the
potential confusion from having two dockers called Styles, some, such
as the shapes library called Funny, simply seem inappropriate. Then
too, the name dockers itself is always going to set North Americans
to thinking of business-casual pants.
</p><p>
Still, KOffice 2.0's final release is less likely to be met with the
same hostility that KDE 4.0 encountered. True, the possibility of some
missing features remains strong&mdash;barring a last-minute coding
blitz&mdash;and some users will complain about any changes.
</p><p>
However, although KOffice 2.0's changes are impossible to miss, they are
far less radical than KDE 4.0's. They are not so much changes in the
basic concepts you need to use the office suite as improvements in
usability. Provided users are not immediately intimidated by the array
of dockers, they should find KOffice 2.0 more accessible and quicker
and easier to use than those of previous releases. These improvements
make KOffice 2.0 a joy to use and more than justify the long wait for
the final release.
