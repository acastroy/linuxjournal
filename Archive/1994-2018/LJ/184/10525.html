Open Kernel Labs' OK:Symbian</h2></div></div><p>
In an effort to expand the reach of the newly open Symbian platform,
Open Kernel Labs has released OK:Symbian, an open-source, ready-to-run,
paravirtualized version of Symbian. OK:Symbian enables the Symbian
platform to be used as a guest operating system running in a secure

that its HyperCell Architecture allows for higher levels of security
and robustness and enables the use of the Symbian platform in new lower-cost devices and in new ways. OK:Symbian also lets handset OEMs, MNOs
and mobile-phone users benefit from the tens of thousands of existing
Symbian applications and the global developer community for the platform.
In related news, Open Kernel Labs announced its joining of the Symbian
Foundation, as well as its contribution of OK:Symbian to the Symbian
Open Source community.

Talend Integration Suite MP<sup  >x</sup></h2></div></div><p>
The good folks at Talend have released the Talend Integration Suite
MP<sup  >x</sup>,
a new enterprise data-integration platform that the company says &ldquo;is
designed to help organizations attain the highest levels of performance
and shatter the limits typically associated with traditional data
integration processes&rdquo;. The solution is based on the Talend Integration
Suite while adding the new FileScale technology, a breakthrough that
allows organizations to conduct highly parallelized processing and reduce
limitations inherent in traditional data-integration architectures.
It further allows integration processes to sort, filter and merge data,
perform aggregation and arithmetic functions, and transform and ensure the
compliance of data. Finally, the new package features multiple levels of
massive parallelization, allowing the execution of separate subprocesses
in parallel, breakdown of data sets into many parallel streams and the
ability to leverage parallel database loaders.
