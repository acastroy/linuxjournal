Add squidGuard's blacklist functionality to your Squid proxy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x1552460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my previous three columns [April, May and July 2009], I described the concept, benefits and
architectural considerations of outbound Web proxies (Part I); 
discussed basic Squid installation, configuration and operation (Part II); and
explained Squid Access Control Lists (ACLs), its ability to run as an
unprivileged user and provided some pointers on running Squid in a chroot jail
(Part III).
</p><p>
Although by no means exhaustively detailed, those articles nonetheless
cover
the bulk of Squid's built-in security functionality (ACLs, running
nonroot and possibly running chrooted). This month, I conclude
this series by covering an important Squid add-on: squidGuard.
</p><p>
squidGuard lets you selectively enforce &ldquo;blacklists&rdquo; of Internet domains
and URLs you don't want end users to be able to reach. Typically,
people use squidGuard with third-party blacklists from various free and
commercial sites, so that's the usage scenario I describe in this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x1552720"></a>
Introduction to squidGuard</h2></div></div><p>
Put simply, squidGuard is a domain and URL filter. It filters domains and
URLs mostly by comparing them against lists (flat files), but also,
optionally, by comparing them against regular expressions.
</p><p>
squidGuard does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> filter
the actual contents of Web sites. This is
the domain of appliance-based commercial Web proxies such as Blue Coat, and
even products like that tend to emphasize URL/domain filtering over actual
content parsing due to the high-computing (performance) cost involved.
</p><p>
You may wonder, what have URL and domain filtering got to do with security?
Isn't that actually a form of censorship and bandwidth-use policing? On the
one hand, yes, to some extent, it is. 
</p><p>
Early in my former career as a firewall engineer and administrator, I
rankled at management's expectation that I maintain lists of the most
popular URLs and domains visited. I didn't think it was my business what
people used their computers for, but rather it should be the job of their immediate
supervisors to know what their own employees were doing.
</p><p>
But the fact is, organizations have the right to manage their bandwidth
and other computing resources as they see fit (provided they're honest with
their members/employees about privacy expectations), and security
professionals are frequently in the best &ldquo;position&rdquo; to know what's
going on. Firewalls and Web proxies typically comprise the most convenient
&ldquo;choke points&rdquo; for monitoring or filtering Web traffic. 
</p><p>
Furthermore, the bigger domain/URL blacklists frequently include categories
for malware, phishing and other Web site categories that do, in fact,
have direct security ramifications. For example, the free Shalla's
Blacklists include more than 27,600 known sources of spyware! 
</p><p>
Even if you don't care about conserving bandwidth or enforcing
acceptable-use policies, there's still value in configuring squidGuard to
block access to &ldquo;known dangerous&rdquo; Web sites. That's precisely what I'm going
to show you how to do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x1552c48"></a>
Getting and Installing squidGuard</h2></div></div><p>
If you run a recent version of Fedora, SUSE, Debian or Ubuntu Linux,
squidGuard is available as a binary package from your OS's usual software
mirrors (in the case of Ubuntu, it's in the universe repositories). If you
run RHEL or CentOS, however, you need to install either Dag Wieers' RPM
of squidGuard version 1.2, Excalibur Partners' RPM
of squidGuard version 1.4, or you'll have to
compile squidGuard from the latest source code, available at the squidGuard
home page (see Resources for the appropriate links). 
</p><p>
Speaking of squidGuard versions, the latest stable version of squidGuard at
the time 
of this writing is squidGuard 1.4. But, if your Linux distribution of choice
provides only squidGuard 1.2, as is the case with Fedora 10 and Ubuntu 9.04,
or as with OpenSUSE 11.1, which has squidGuard 1.3, don't worry. Your distribution
almost certainly has back-ported any applicable squidGuard 1.4 security
patches, and from a functionality standpoint, the most compelling feature
in 1.4 absent in earlier versions is support for MySQL authentication.
</p><p>
Hoping you'll forgive my Ubuntu bias of late, the command to install
squidGuard on Ubuntu systems is simply:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo apt-get squidguard
</pre>
</p><p>
As noted above, squidGuard is in the universe repository, so you'll
either need to uncomment the universe lines in /etc/apt/sources.list, or
open Ubuntu's Software Sources applet, and assuming it isn't already
checked, check the box next to Community-maintained Open Source software
(universe), which will uncomment those lines for you.
</p><p>
Besides using apt-get from a command prompt to install squidGuard, you
could instead use the Synaptic package manager. Either of these three
approaches automatically results in your system's downloading and
installing a deb archive of squidGuard.
</p><p>
If you need a more-current version of squidGuard than what your
distribution provides and are willing to take it upon yourself to keep it
patched for emerging security bugs, the squidGuard home page has
complete instructions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x1552f60"></a>
Getting and Installing Blacklists</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've obtained and installed squidGuard, you need a set of
blacklists. There's a decent list of links to these at
<a href="http://squidguard.org/blacklists.html" target="_self">squidguard.org/blacklists.html</a>, and of these, I think you could do
far worse than Shalla's Blacklists (see Resources), a free-for-noncommercial-use set that
includes more than 1.6 million entries organized into 65 categories. It's also
free for commercial use; you just have to register and promise to provide
feedback and list updates.
Shalla's Blacklists are the set I
use for the configuration examples through the rest of this article. 
</p><p>
Once you've got a blacklist archive, unpack it. It doesn't necessarily
matter where, so long as the entire directory hierarchy is owned by the
same user and group under which Squid runs (proxy:proxy on Ubuntu
systems). A common default location for blacklists is
/var/lib/squidguard/db.
</p><p>
To extract Shalla's Blacklists to that directory, I move the archive
file there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ cp mv shallalist.tar.gz /var/lib/squidguard/db
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I unpack it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo -s
bash-# cd /var/lib/squidguard/db
bash-# tar --strip 1 -xvzf shallalist.tar.gz
bash-# rm shallalist.tar.tz
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above tar command, the <tt  >--strip 2</tt> option
strips the leading <tt  >BL/</tt>
from the paths of everything extracted from the shallalist tar archive.
Without this option, there would be an additional directory (BL/) under
/var/lib/squidguard/db containing the blacklist categories, for example,
/var/lib/squidguard/db/BL/realestate rather than
/var/lib/squidguard/db/realestate. Note that you definitely want to delete
the shallalist.tar.gz file as shown above; otherwise, squidGuard will
include it in the database into which the contents of
/var/lib/squidguard/db will later be imported.
</p><p>
Note also that at this point you're still in a root shell; you need to stay
there
for just a few more commands. To set appropriate ownership and permissions
for your blacklists, use these commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# chown -R proxy:proxy /var/lib/squidguard/db/
bash-# find /var/lib/squidguard/db -type f | xargs chmod 644
bash-# find /var/lib/squidguard/db -type d | xargs chmod 755
bash-# exit
</pre>
</p><p>
And with that, your blacklists are ready for squidGuard to start blocking.
After, that is, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>configure</em></span> squidGuard to do so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x1553538"></a>
Configuring squidGuard</h2></div></div><p>
On Ubuntu and OpenSUSE systems (and probably others), squidGuard's
configuration file squidGuard.conf is kept in /etc/squid/, and squidGuard
automatically looks there when it starts. As root, use the text editor
of your choice to open /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf. If using a command-line
editor like vi on Ubuntu systems, don't forget to use
<tt  >sudo</tt>, as with
practically everything else under /etc/, you need to have
superuser privileges to change squidGuard.conf.
</p><p>
squidGuard.conf's basic structure is:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Options (mostly paths)
</p></li><li><p>
Time Rules
</p></li><li><p>
Rewrite Rules
</p></li><li><p>
Source Addresses
</p></li><li><p>
Destination Classes
</p></li><li><p>
Access Control Lists
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In this article, my goal is quite modest: to help you get started with a
simple blacklist that applies to all users, regardless of time of day, and
without any fancier URL-rewriting than redirecting all blocked transactions
to the same page. Accordingly, let's focus on examples of Options,
Destination Classes and ACLs. 
Before you change squidGuard.conf, it's a good idea to make a backup copy,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo cp /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf
/etc/squid/squidGuard.conf.def
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can edit squidGuard.conf. First, at the top, leave what are
probably the default values of dbhome and logdir, which specify the paths
of squidGuard's databases of blacklists (or whitelists&mdash;you also
can write ACLs that explicitly <span   class="emphasis"><em>allow</em></span> access to certain sites and domains)
and its log files, respectively. These are the defaults in Ubuntu:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dbhome /var/lib/squidguard/db
logdir /var/log/squid
</pre>
</p><p>
These paths are easy enough to understand, especially considering that you
just extracted Shalla's Blacklists to /var/lib/squidguard/db. Whatever you
do, do not leave a completely blank line at the very top of the file;
doing so prevents squidGuard from starting properly.
</p><p>
Next, you need to create a Destination Class. This being a security column,
let's focus on blocking access to sites in the spyware and
remotecontrol categories. You certainly don't want your users' systems
to become infected with spyware, and you probably don't want users to grant
outsiders remote control of their systems either. 
</p><p>
Destination Classes that describe these two categories from Shalla's
Blacklists look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dest remotecontrol {
        domainlist      remotecontrol/domains
        urllist         remotecontrol/urls
}

dest spyware {
        domainlist      spyware/domains
        urllist         spyware/urls
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the paths in each domainlist and urllist statement are
relative to the top-level database path you specified with the dbhome
option. Note also the curly bracket {} placement: left brackets always
immediately follow the destination name, on the same line, and 
right brackets always occupy their own line at the end of the class
definition.
</p><p>
Finally, you need an ACL that references these destinations&mdash;specifically,
one that blocks access to them. The ACL syntax in squidGuard is actually
quite flexible, and it's easy to write both &ldquo;allow all
except...&rdquo; and
&ldquo;block all except...&rdquo; ACLs. Like most ACL languages, they're parsed
left to right, top to bottom. Once a given transaction matches any element
in an ACL, it's either blocked or passed as specified, and not matched
against subsequent elements or ACLs.
</p><p>
You can have multiple ACL definitions in your squidGuard.conf file, but in
this example scenario, it will suffice to edit the default ACL. A simple
default ACL that passes all traffic unless destined for sites in the
remotecontrol or spyware blacklists would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
acl {
        default {
                pass !remotecontrol !spyware all
                redirect http://www.google.com
        }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, default is the name of the ACL. Your default
squidGuard.conf file probably already has an ACL definition named default,
so be sure either to edit that one or delete it before entering the above
definition; you can't have two different ACLs both named default.
</p><p>
The pass statement says that things matching remotecontrol (as defined
in the prior Destination Class of that name) do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> get passed, nor
does spyware, but all (a wild card that matches anything that makes it
that far in the pass statement) does. In other words, if a given
destination matches anything in the remotecontrol or spyware blacklists
(either by domain or URL), it won't be passed, but rather will be
redirected per the subsequent redirect statement, which points to the
Google home page.
</p><p>
Just to make sure you understand how this works, let me point out that if the
wild card all occurred before <tt  >!remotecontrol</tt>, as in
&ldquo;pass all
!remotecontrol !spyware&rdquo;, squidGuard would not block anything,
because
matched transactions aren't compared against any elements that follow the
element they matched. When constructing ACLs,
remember that order matters!
</p><p>
I freely admit I'm being very lazy in specifying that as my redirect page.
More professional system administrators would want to put a customized
&ldquo;You've been redirected here because...&rdquo; message onto a Web server under
their control and list that URL instead. Alternatively, squidGuard comes
with a handy CGI script that displays pertinent transaction data back to
the user. On Ubuntu systems, the script's full path is
/usr/share/doc/squidguard/examples/squidGuard.cgi.gz.
</p><p>
This brings me to my only complaint about squidGuard: if you want to
display a custom message to redirected clients, you either need to run
Apache on your Squid server and specify an http://localhost/ URL, or
specify a URL pointing to some other Web server you control. This is in
contrast to Squid itself, which has no problem displaying its own custom
messages to clients without requiring a dedicated HTTP d&aelig;mon (either local
or external).
</p><p>
To review, your complete sample
squidGuard.conf file (not counting any commented-out lines from the default
file) should look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dbhome /var/lib/squidguard/db
logdir /var/log/squid

dest remotecontrol {
        domainlist      remotecontrol/domains
        urllist         remotecontrol/urls
}

dest spyware {
        domainlist      spyware/domains
        urllist         spyware/urls
}

acl {
        default {
                pass !remotecontrol !spyware all
                redirect http://www.google.com
        }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that squidGuard is configured and, among other things, knows where to
look for its databases, you need to create actual database files for the
files and directories under /var/lib/squidGuard/db, using this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo -u proxy squidGuard -C all
</pre>
</p><p>
This imports all files specified in active Destination Class definitions in
squidGuard.conf, specifically in this example, the files
remotecontrol/domains, remotecontrol/urls, spyware/domains and
spyware/urls, into Berkeley DB-format databases. Obviously, squidGuard can
access the blacklists much faster using database files than by parsing flat
text files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x194c808"></a>
Configuring Squid to Use squidGuard</h2></div></div><p>
The last thing you need to do is reconfigure Squid to use squidGuard as
a redirector and tell it how many redirector processes to keep running.
The location of your squidGuard binary is highly distribution-specific; to
be sure, you can find it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ which squidGuard
/usr/bin/squidGuard
</pre>
</p><p>
As for the number of redirector processes, you want a good balance of
system resource usage and squidGuard performance. Starting a lot of
redirectors consumes resources but maximizes squidGuard performance,
whereas starting only a couple conserves resources by sacrificing
squidGuard performance. Ubuntu's default of 5 is a reasonable middle
ground.
</p><p>
The squid.conf parameters for both of these settings (redirector location
and number of processes) are different depending on with which version of Squid
you're using squidGuard. For Squid versions 2.5 and earlier, they're
redirect_program and redirect_children. For Squid versions 2.6 and
later, they're url_rewrite_program and url_rewrite_program.
</p><p>
For example, on my Ubuntu 9.04 system, which runs Squid version 2.7, I used
a text editor (run via sudo) to add the following two lines to
/etc/squid/squid.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
url_rewrite_program /usr/bin/squidGuard
url_rewrite_children 5
</pre>
</p><p>
As with any other time you edit /etc/squid/squid.conf, it's probably a good
idea to add custom configuration lines before or after their corresponding
comment blocks. squid.conf, you may recall, is essentially
self-documented&mdash;it contains many lines of example settings and descriptions of them, all
in the form of comments (lines beginning with #). Keeping your
customizations near their corresponding examples/defaults/comments both
minimizes the chance you'll define the same parameter in two different
places, and, of course, it gives you easy access to information about the things
you're changing.
</p><p>
By the way, I'm assuming Squid itself <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> is installed,
configured and working the way you want it to (beyond blacklisting). If
you haven't gotten that far before installing squidGuard, please refer to my
previous three columns (see Resources).
</p><p>
Before those changes take effect, you need to restart Squid. On
most Linux systems, you can use this command (omitting the sudo if you're
already in a root shell):

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ /etc/init.d/squid reload
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get no error messages, and if when you do a <tt  >ps -axuw
|grep squid</tt>
you see not only a couple Squid processes, but also five squidGuard
processes, then congratulations! You've now got a working installation of
squidGuard.
</p><p>
But is it actually doing what you want it to do? Given the filters we just put
in place, the quickest way to tell is, on some client configured to use your Squid
proxy, to point a browser to http://www.gotomypc.com (a site in the
remotecontrol blacklist). If everything's working correctly, your browser
will not pull up gotomypc, but rather Google. squidGuard is
passive-aggressively encouraging you to surf to a safer site!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145a580.0x194cd88"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
squidGuard isn't the only Squid add-on of interest to the security-conscious. squidtaild and squidview, for example, are two different programs for
monitoring and creating reports from Squid logs (both of them are available
in Ubuntu's universe repository). I leave it to you though
to take your Squid server to the next level.
</p><p>
This concludes my introductory series on building a secure Web proxy with
Squid. I hope you're off to a good, safe start!
