Despite some revolutionary new features, &ldquo;Python 3.0 will be the
same language you've loved and used before, it's just been cleaned up
a bit&rdquo;, says Python creator, Guido van Rossum.

Python is the wildly popular, high-level programming language that was
recently voted Favorite Scripting Language in the 2008 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
Readers' Choice Awards. In this interview, Python's creator Guido van
Rossum shares his insights about the revolutionary new Python 3000,
why the pain from backward incompatibility is worth it, what he foresees
for the Python 2.6 fork, and what he's been up to lately at Google.

By the time readers see this interview, Python 3000
(aka Py3K and Python 3.0) should be available. What is in the new
version that will excite developers?
</p><p>
GVR: You've probably heard that Python 3000 will introduce
backward-incompatible changes. That alone probably is enough to get
developers excited, or at least upset. So let me emphasize first
that, by and large, Python 3.0 will be the same language you've loved and
used before, it's just been cleaned up a bit. You may want to contrast
this with Perl 6 vs. Perl 4, where Perl 6 is a totally new language,
with a completely different implementation. We're not doing anything
remotely as drastic as that!
</p><p>
Many of the cleanups are pretty benign. For example, we're finally
getting rid of string exceptions (all exceptions have to be
defined as classes). There is a large class of cleanups like this,
and I refer your readers to the python.org Web site for the (mostly)
boring details.
</p><p>
Some changes <span   class="emphasis"><em>seem</em></span> controversial but actually are a big
improvement, such as replacing the print statement with a print() function.
The big advantage of making it a function is that we can use the familiar
keyword=value syntax to specify behavioral variations like printing to a
different file or suppressing the final newline. We also can 
add new keywords more easily. For example, in Py3k you can override the separator
between items, and this makes future evolution much easier compared to
evolution of a statement-based syntax. Using standard function syntax
also makes it much easier to replace the built-in print function with a
function of your own design. This is a common transformation over the
lifetime of a program. What started out as simple print statements at
some point have to become logging calls or at least redirectable to a
different file, and all these changes are easier to make consistently
with function calls.
</p><p>
There is one group of changes that is (relatively speaking) revolutionary,
and at the same time, it is probably responsible for the most conversion pain,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> for the largest sigh of relief. We're adopting a fundamentally
different attitude toward Unicode. A bit of history: Python 1 
supported only eight-bit strings, which were used for text and binary data
alike. Python 2 kept this dual use of eight-bit strings, but added Unicode
strings. This was done so as to maintain backward compatibility with
Python 1, but it created a new major ambiguity. There were two ways
of representing text strings, either as eight-bit strings or as Unicode
strings. Moreover, the meaning of eight-bit strings remained ambiguous,
as these were used for text as well as binary data.
</p><p>
In Python 3, we're breaking with compatibility and drawing the line
differently. There will be a bytes type to be used for binary data
(and <span   class="emphasis"><em>encoded</em></span> text, like UTF-8 or UTF-16), and there
will be an str
type to be used for text only and capable of representing all Unicode
characters. The implementation of the bytes type closely resembles
that of the old eight-bit string type, and the implementation of the
str type is copied from the old Unicode type. The big improvement
over Python 2 is that both ambiguities I mentioned above are removed.
There is now a 1:1 mapping between usage (data or text) and types (bytes
or str). Reports from early adopters have shown that developers really
appreciate this change and are happy to pay for it. Some third-party
projects, such as Django, already have adopted a convention in Python 2 that
essentially is the same. All text is stored in Unicode strings, and eight-bit
strings store only binary data, but Python 2 doesn't help enforce this.
</p><p>
There also are some other changes related to Unicode. The default source
encoding is now UTF-8, identifiers can contain non-ASCII letters, and
the repr() function no longer will turn all non-ASCII characters into
hex escapes (it still will escape control characters of course).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
In retrospect, do you regret any changes that made it through to
the final version?
</p><p>
GVR: No, I'm very happy with the outcome. I think we've struck a
phenomenal balance between changing too much and changing too little. It
has really helped that toward the end of the Py3k development, we switched
to a time-based release schedule, so we had a clear way to stop the
never-ending stream of proposals for yet more language improvements.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Python 3000 is currently slower than 2.5. Will it be as fast or
faster once it is seriously tuned?
</p><p>
GVR: I expect that by the time 3.0 is released, we'll be close to
the 2.5 speed. We'll probably keep tuning it well beyond that, and if
past history is any measure of future performance, we'll see continued
speed improvements as new releases come out.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Python 3 breaks backward compatibility with version 2.6. This is a
pretty bold step for a programming language in general and in particular
for one with a user base the size of Python's. The only other time
I remember somebody trying this was when Microsoft went from
VB6 to VB.NET, a move that has a lot of VB6 programmers still miffed six
years later. Do you have concerns regarding this move?
</p><p>
GVR: I think you may have forgotten about Perl 6. 
</p><p>
My understanding is that VB.NET was actually fundamentally different
from VB6, much more so than Python 3 differs from Python 2. Most of
the differences in Python 3 are relatively close to the surface. In
particular, we've made a conscious choice <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to radically change
the underlying implementation. If I understand correctly, VB.NET uses a
completely different virtual machine (based on the new .NET technology)
from VB6. This is not the case for Python 3. We started Py3k as a
branch of the Python 2 VM and gradually modified it to support the new
language. But, most implementation details are exactly the same, and up
to this date, we routinely merge changes from the trunk (which will be
released as Python 2.6) into the Py3k branch.
</p><p>
I certainly don't want to underestimate the cost for developers of the
transition from Python 2 to Py3k. We have been thinking about this
transition for at least two years now, and we have several parallel
strategies in place to make developers comfortable with the change.
</p><p>
First of all, Python 2 will be fully supported for a long time in parallel
with Python 3. My personal expectation is that there will be a period
of at least three to five years where developers have complete freedom to choose
between Python 2 or Python 3, getting the same level of support. There
will be new releases of Python 2, starting with 2.6, in parallel with
the Python 3 releases.
</p><p>
Second, we have designed a specific two-prong transition strategy. The
first prong of this strategy is the release of Python 2.6 simultaneously
with the 3.0 release. 2.6 will be backward compatible with 2.5, but it
also will contain an <span   class="emphasis"><em>optional</em></span> set of warnings that
alert you about a
variety of issues in your program that will break if and when you port
it to Py3k. These warnings are issued only when specifically requested
via a command-line option, so that they are not an impediment toward
upgrading from 2.4 or 2.5 to 2.6, regardless of whether you are planning
to port your code over to 3.0. In addition, 2.6 also will contain
some back-ported 3.0 features, which we hope will encourage people to start
using 2.6 in a way that will reduce the pain when they are ready for 3.0.
</p><p>
The second prong of the transition strategy is a source code conversion
tool that we call 2to3. This tool handles most of the small syntactic
changes you encounter when converting Python 2 code to Py3k. For example,
it automatically translates print statements into print() function calls,
turns Unicode literals (such as <tt  >u"..."</tt>) into regular string literals, strips
the trailing L from long integer literals, and so on. It also does a
decent (though not perfect) job of converting calls to popular dictionary
methods like .keys() and .iterkeys() into their Py3k equivalent.
</p><p>
The two prongs complement each other nicely. The 2to3 tool takes care
of the syntactic changes, and the Py3k warnings in Python 2.6 handle
those changes that a purely syntactic tool cannot handle easily. Because
Python is such a dynamic language, conversions that require information
about the type of a variable or attribute generally cannot be automated.
The 2to3 tool leaves these alone, but there is enough overlap between the
2.6 and 3.0 languages that, in general, it will be possible to change your
source code in such a way that it still is compatible with Python 2.6
(and usually with older versions as well), produces no Py3k warnings,
and can be translated safely to valid Python 3.0 source code using the
2to3 tool.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Also, how complex do you think that the upgrade process to Python
3000 will be?
</p><p>
GVR:
I think I've given a decent indication of the complexity in my answer
to the previous question. The general work flow for a conversion could
be as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Start with code that works under Python 2.4 or 2.5 and has a good
test suite.
</p></li><li><p>
Port to Python 2.6. This should be straightforward. Try to run the
test suite under Python 2.6, resolve issues found, and repeat until all
tests pass. Python developers have used this process for years with the
transition to each Python version, and the expectation is that there
won't be many changes to make.
</p></li><li><p>
Turn on Py3k warnings and run the test suite again. Resolve issues
reported, and repeat until all tests pass without warnings.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the 2to3 tool over your source code, including your test suite,
and run the converted test suite under Python 3.0. If there are issues,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't fix them here</em></span>, but fix them in the 2.6 code base, and repeat
starting from step 3.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In terms of revision control, you most likely will be maintaining two
branches of your code long term: the 2.6 version and the 3.0 version.
Changes to the 2.6 version should be merged to the 3.0 version using
the 2to3 tool.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
What kind of feedback have you gotten from the early adopters of
Python 3000 thus far?
</p><p>
GVR: We've heard everything from pure excitement to extreme
fear. Given the magnitude of the change, we can't expect everybody to be
happy, but the general trend is one of cautious optimism. As expected,
most developers are happy with most of the new features. Although almost
everyone has a pet peeve or two, those appear to be mostly outliers,
and there aren't any changes that stand out as unwanted by many.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Have any large projects already been converted to Python 3000,
and what have the results been?
</p><p>
GVR: It's too early to say. We've only just released the first
betas of 2.6 and 3.0, and so far, the focus of third-party developers,
especially of large packages, has been on 2.6 over 3.0.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Is there a chance that there might be a rogue fork of the 2.x line,
and would this bother you?
</p><p>
GVR: I don't expect any &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; forks to happen. The Python
community tends to prefer consensus over conflict, at least in the
long term.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
What was the process by which changes were accepted or rejected in
the upgrade process?
</p><p>
GVR: We started out by setting some basic parameters for the
upgrade, in PEP 3000: the goal was primarily to fix early design
mistakes and clean up situations where two ways to do something had
evolved out of a desire to improve the language while also maintaining
backward compatibility (for example, new-style vs. classic classes). This was
a powerful argument to keep many of the more radical change proposals
out of the door.
</p><p>
The rest was a matter of long community discussions with the occasional
tie-cutting by yours truly in case a consensus remained elusive. I have
an incredibly subtle set of gut feelings for judging the most
&ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo;
solution to any one issue, keeping a precarious balance between pragmatics
and principles. But, I have tried to use this only after ample discussion
had clarified motivations and use cases for proposed changes.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Were there any changes you wanted that were rejected, or any that
you didn't want that were accepted?
</p><p>
GVR: That's hard to say. I certainly have proposed things
that were rejected, but in the end, I always ended up agreeing with the
rejection&mdash;and, ditto in the other direction.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> How are your synapses currently firing regarding Python 4000 and
beyond?
</p><p>
GVR: I hope I'll be in retirement by then!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Our Publisher Emeritus and your old friend Phil Hughes asked me
to ask you, &ldquo;Is Django [the high-level Python Web framework] as cool as
it appears?&rdquo;
</p><p>
GVR: Oh yes, it is. (And hi, Phil!) I like it because it strikes
a very Pythonic balance between theory and practice, and because the
organization of the project is very similar to that of Python itself.
The Django developers run an excellent open-source project, listening
carefully to their users and contributors, without being distracted by
&ldquo;feature-itis&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
KDE 4.x has abandoned the classic desktop for Plasma, which supports
writing scripted add-ons, or applets, in a number of programming
languages. Do you see a role for Python in this space?
</p><p>
GVR: This is the first I've heard of this, so I'd rather not make
any rash comments. I hope that if Plasma becomes popular, its developer
makes it scriptable using Python.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
What interesting trends have you seen lately in the development of
the Python community?
</p><p>
GVR: I'm very happy with the influx of new developers in the past
year or so. This has really enriched the community with new ideas and
new areas of expertise, and removed the pressure from some of the old
hands who have been keeping things running for many years.
</p><p>
Another, quite unrelated, but also hugely exciting, trend is the activity
in the PyPy Project. As you may remember, PyPy started out as an attempt
to write a portable Python interpreter in Python, made fast by the use
of a Python-specific JIT. Most PyPy developers are in Europe, and with
two years of EU (European Union) funding, the project has made tremendous
progress. As agreed ahead of time, the EU funding ended after two years,
but recently Google has started funding some specific PyPy activities,
and I am excited that these will eventually make PyPy a viable alternative
to CPython.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
You have been working for Google now for almost three years. Can you
divulge what they've had you working on, or is it top secret? Also,
is Python subject to Google's 80/20 rule&mdash;the one that allows employees
to spend 20% of their time on personal projects that are potentially
worthwhile to the business&mdash;or do you have a different arrangement?
</p><p>
GVR: It's no secret that my first Google project was Mondrian, an
internal Web tool for collaborative code reviews using Perforce. Since
last November, I've been working on Google App Engine, an exciting project that
allows Web developers to run scalable Python Web applications on Google's
powerful infrastructure. (In the future, other languages also will be
supported.)
</p><p>
I have written an App Engine demo that reuses some components of Mondrian
and refactors them into a code review tool for Subversion. With Google's
permission, I have released this as open source. You can see it working
at <a href="http://codereview.appspot.com" target="_self">codereview.appspot.com</a>, and you can find a link to the source
code there as well.
</p><p>
I don't have a 20% project per se, but I have Google's agreement that I
can spend 50% of my time on Python, with no strings attached, so I call
this my &ldquo;50% project&rdquo;.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
