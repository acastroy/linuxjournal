The soon-to-be-released version of Enlightenment, E17, offers a
lightweight, yet stunning, alternative to KDE and GNOME.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eac580.0x1fa4250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Do you remember the first time you saw the phenomenally successful &ldquo;Get a
Mac&rdquo; ad campaign? The American ads feature actor Justin Long as the friendly,
calm and casual Mac, paired with funny-man John Hodgman as the uptight,
insecure and nerdy PC. And, the ads always begin the same way: &ldquo;Hi...I'm
a Mac, and I'm a PC.&rdquo; The obvious intent of each personification is
to show that the Mac resembles a more youthful Steve Jobs, and the PC closely
resembles Bill Gates. It's brilliant marketing. The gist of the ads is
this: PCs are prone to malware of all types and are difficult to use, and 
the Mac is not only easy to use, but it's also safe and secure. For
those who switch to a Mac, all their problems will disappear. The target audience for this campaign is not the avid PC user but
rather those who use a PC because they are unaware of 
other options. And, this message has been extremely effective, with Mac sales
 increasing a whopping 12% at the end of fiscal year 2006&mdash;that's a total
of 1.3 million new Mac users.
</p><p>
So, why is the &ldquo;Get a Mac&rdquo; campaign so successful? Because the ads utilize
a technique known as framing, where the viewer's perception is
manipulated through selective information. In this case, the ads support a
framed dualism where the viewer's presented choices are only PC or Mac.
No other choices (although obviously they exist) are mentioned. This leads the
viewer to think the Mac is better than the PC for a multitude of
reasons, each highlighted by the various ads. And, who wouldn't want to be
more like the hip Justin Long?
</p><p>
We Linux users are thrust into an unspoken dualism of our own. Through the
various flame wars pitting the KDE desktop over GNOME, the major
distributions choosing sides and Linux founder Linus Torvalds throwing his
weight behind KDE, it may appear to newbie Linux users or 
prospective users that Linux is a dualistic system. You choose either KDE
or GNOME. Unlike the dualism shown in the Mac ads, both
KDE and GNOME have good qualities. No one desktop reigns supreme. They both utilize the same Linux
kernel, and both are equally successful.
</p><p>
Lost in the smokescreen of the desktop wars are the lesser-known desktops
and window managers of which the lightweight Xfce desktop and the
Enlightenment window manager are a part. This article focuses on
Enlightenment, primarily the new and improved E17 (formerly known as DR17,
because it's a developer release still in beta). Created in 1997,
Enlightenment, hereafter referred to as E, originally was based on the
FVWM window manager. Since then, it has forked out on its own and no longer
shares borrowed code from FVWM or any other window manager or desktop.
This lays precedent to the claim of E's developers that E17 is at the
forefront of the next generation of desktops.
However, the word desktop conjures up thoughts of KDE and GNOME,
but that is not what is meant by &ldquo;next generation&rdquo;.
Rather, E is a desktop shell.
</p><p>
Desktop shell means an entity that sits somewhere
between a minimal window manager and a full-featured desktop experience
(like KDE or GNOME). For this reason, E's developers state that E is not
intended to compete with either of those desktops. Instead, E is a
desktop shell, combining a window manager with a file manager and configuration
utilities. This new structure &ldquo;will provide integration between files and
your environment in a seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich
and flexible architecture&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10144f1.large.jpg"><img src="10144f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. E's Very Useful Task Bar&mdash;an Essential Part of E17
</p></div></div><p>
E is possible because of the exclusive EFL (Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries) written on behalf of E17.
Parts of EFL are stable&mdash;like the newly updated Eet, a data encoding,
decoding and storage library, which has been granted a 1.0 status.
However, most of the coding is not yet complete, which places E17 in beta,
rendering the system not completely stable as a desktop.
Still, many users are choosing E17, thanks to its amazing ability to
resurrect older PCs and bring systems with as little as 100MHz CPUs
and 64MB of RAM to life again.
Plus, E17 provides much-needed eye candy, with dazzling 2-D effects, to
these older PCs&mdash;effects that would use a large amount of system resources
through Compiz Fusion.
No special 3-D graphics cards are needed for these effects on E.
It's all in the EFL code.
</p><p>
In addition, EFL enables the potential for animated themes, animated boot
screens, virtual desktops (up to 24) with separate animated backgrounds
and more. Menus and borders are equally animated&mdash;or they can be if the
theme allows&mdash;making E17 a unique experience.
</p><p>
In fact, that very uniqueness could be its potential downfall. Because E is not
like anything else, users probably will encounter a short
learning curve when using the desktop&mdash;figuring out where things are
placed, how to summon the menu and how to configure various desktop
elements. At first, one of the most disturbing features for me was
calling up the menu by right-clicking my mouse on the desktop canvas.
It takes a little getting used to, but after a while, it
becomes second nature. It's the little things like this, the
eccentricities of E, that seem awkward at first.
</p><p>
E17 noticeably lacks a stable file manager.
As I mentioned earlier, the E developers melded the window manager with the
file manager and configuration utilities, resulting in the next generation
of desktop shells. Without the file manager, which is under
heavy development, E is nothing more than a window manager. So, those
distributions using E17 are integrating alternate file managers
atop E to bridge this hole. Once the E file manager (EFM)
is stable enough for everyday usage, it too will be configurable with eye candy
equivalent in style to the rest of E. You will be able to search your
files like any other file manager, with visual thumbnails that open into the
application of your choice.
</p><p>
Other elements of E still on the plate include engage, the Mac OS X
look-alike task bar (usable); entice, an image viewer; express, E's
instant-messaging client; elation, a DVD-player GUI; embrace, an e-mail checker;
elinguish, a BitTorent client; and several other components. 
</p><p>
Almost everything about E is configurable. E includes a configuration panel
allowing you to change many features, such as the wallpaper,
theme, fonts, screen resolution, power settings, mouse and keyboard
settings and more. This is nothing exceptional. I'm merely pointing out
that E resembles a desktop with configuration options like KDE and
GNOME. Clearly E is intended to be more than a simple window
manager resting above a desktop foundation like frosting on a cake. E is
both cake and frosting, but the cake still is being whipped together.
</p><p>
Another useful configuration option for E17 is the ability to change the
language on the fly. Twenty languages currently are supported, including
English, French, Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. And, there is no
need to restart the X server to switch between languages. It's instant.
</p><p>
E also includes the ability to add or remove little applications
called modules. E's modules are similar to KDE's SuperKaramba
or the Mac dashboard, adding functionalities like weather, calendars, volume
control, temperature monitor, CPU frequency widget, battery monitor (for
laptops), clock and more. The sky's the limit for future development
of additional modules. And, selected modules appear in real time. There is
no need to restart X or press a special combination of buttons to view them. It
will be interesting to see the many modules that develop once E17 is
officially released as a 1.0.
</p><p>
The question remains, is E17 ready for a standalone desktop? Probably
not for business purposes, but it can be quite useful personally. Although E
can crash, most crashes are not system-related, so whenever an application
crashes, it simply can be closed down and restarted. This can and does happen
occasionally, and these minor inconveniences should be worked out in
later releases.
</p><p>
There are a few simple ways to try E17. If you are running Ubuntu, there
is a method from the user forums where you can install E to be one of the
choices available at boot. However, post-installation, you will be missing
pertinent files that enable every feature to work properly. For that
reason, you might want to try a distribution from a live CD with everything
tweaked to work. Using E17 as a window manager above
either GNOME or KDE does not provide the full extent of E's power.
Besides, this sort of defeats the purpose of resurrecting older equipment.
If you install E as a window manager, you lose its power and speed.
Yes, E is very fast&mdash;think Xfce on steroids.
</p><p>
Tutorials for installing E17 exist for Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo and
Arch Linux. If you are interested in running E17 as a window manager,
refer to the user forums for these distributions for directions. 
Instructions for Ubuntu are at
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=97199&amp;highlight=E17+cvs" target="_self">ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=97199&amp;highlight=E17+cvs</a>,
and instructions for
Fedora and Mandrake users are at <a href="http://sps.nus.edu.sg/~didierbe" target="_self">sps.nus.edu.sg/~didierbe</a>.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, the best way to try E17 is by choosing a live CD
with E pre-installed. There are a few from which to choose, and I
briefly highlight each here. 
The following desktop experiences range from a lesser extreme, where E is
moderately used, to a full extreme, where E is used exclusively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eac580.0x1fa4da8"></a>
gOS Space 2.9&mdash;the Lesser Extreme</h2></div></div><p>
Hardware requirements are 700MHz CPU, 384MB of RAM, 8GB disk space, graphics
card capable of 1024x768 resolution, sound card and Internet connection.
</p><p>
There was a lot of hype over gOS when it was still being discussed in forums.
It was thought that Google was creating a Linux distribution of its own.
But, this turned out to be in error.
gOS is a polished distribution that utilizes certain elements of Enlightenment
for its beautiful special effects.
It also uses the GNOME desktop and Compiz&mdash;thus, the slightly more modern
hardware requirements.
Space 2.9 is geared toward the 100,000,000 MySpace users.
The revolutionary space dock used by gOS closely resembles the Mac OS X
dock with stacks that open and swerve to reveal further options beneath.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10144f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Look at gOS
</p></div></div><p>
gOS is an excellent system for the modern digital life. It includes
everything users ever would need in an Internet system. However, gOS falls
short in its full usage of E17. There are too many
other elements in play where E is neither seen nor heard. For instance,
E's Engage dock is replaced with a gOS creation. Plus, E's eye candy has
been overridden by Compiz Fusion. So, where is E? In my opinion, gOS is a
Mac copycat, and that's not a bad
thing. In fact, I think it's a welcome twist to the numerous Windows
look-alikes in the Linux community.
So, if you're looking for a fast, fun to use and
Mac-like distribution, try gOS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eac580.0x1fa5118"></a>
Elive&mdash;the Further Extreme (Where Debian Meets Enlightenment)</h2></div></div><p>
Hardware requirements are 300MHz CPU and 128MB of RAM.
</p><p>
Elive is an attempt at a pure E17 desktop experience. It also includes the
former E16 stable release; both are available at boot. I really
enjoyed the E17 experience using Elive. It's small enough that it can be
run comfortably from the live CD without installing it. Although some
features, such as
playing DVDs, were not enabled. The Elive CD is the fastest
live CD I have tried to date,
which must be due to the inherent speed of E.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10144f3.large.jpg"><img src="10144f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Glimpse at the Elive CD
</p></div></div><p>
Elive has a very polished look and offers two themes: night or day. I did not
experience any crashes while using the system, although don't expect
everything to work without problems, as E17 still is under development. If
stability is what you prefer, you can try the E16
desktop, but E16 is not as pretty.
</p><p>
Elive contains its own configuration panel, called Epanel, which enables
users
to control the entire E system&mdash;adding and removing packages, configuring
hardware (Elive has great hardware support by the way) and customizing the
overall look and feel of the system. 
</p><p>
If you want a true E experience, try Elive.
My only issue with Elive is that it requires users to pay a minimal
fee before downloading. The default is $15 US, though this can be dropped
to $5. And yes, it is possible to download it free of charge, but to do
so, you
must send the developers an e-mail asking for an invitation code.
</p><p>
My only only concern with Elive is that Enlightenment is not ready as
a full-featured desktop experience&mdash;some features seem
unfinished. But, Elive is a wonderful awe-inspiring walk
down the path to Enlightenment.
</p><p>
So, if you want to try E17 exclusively, with no added components from other
window managers/desktops, don't hesitate to download Elive.
After all, $5 will aid Elive's developers to continue their noble
work.

OpenGEU (Formerly Geubuntu)&mdash;Somewhere in the Middle</h2></div></div><p>
I first should mention that OpenGEU is not an official Ubuntu
derivative. It is based on Ubuntu and shares its repositories, but it's
not Ubuntu. OpenGEU's subtitle explains the philosophy behind
this newer distribution: &ldquo;when a GNOME reaches Enlightenment&rdquo;. 
OpenGEU's ambition is to fill in the missing parts of E17 with the working parts of
the GNOME desktop or Xfce. And, it does this very well. This
hybrid system is a fully functional Enlightenment desktop with the power of
Ubuntu's GNOME desktop melded with the effects of E17. For example, the
file manager missing from E17 is filled with the Xfce Thunar file manager,
and it works without a hitch. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10144f4.large.jpg"><img src="10144f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. OpenGEU
</p></div></div><p>
OpenGEU includes two themes: sunshine and moonlight. Both are exquisitely
beautiful with animated elements&mdash;typical E style. In the sunshine
theme, the sunbeams appear to shine forth at certain times, and under the
moonlight theme, the Enlightenment E logo apparent on the moon reflects within
the ripples of an ocean of water at regular intervals. Users can change
between themes at the press of a button. Other themes are included, and users can download additional themes from get-E.org. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10144f5.large.jpg"><img src="10144f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. OpenGEU's Moonlight Theme
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10144f6.large.jpg"><img src="10144f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. OpenGEU's Sunshine Theme
</p></div></div><p>
OpenGEU not only borrows Xfce's Thunar file manager, but it also borrows its
panel. And, the bar across the top of the screen is from GNOME. But, hidden
beneath the scenes is E. I am delighted with the mix. The
distribution is not without its bugs, but E's performance does not appear to be altered in
the least through the addition of various GNOME and Xfce components.
OpenGEU is a glimpse of what we can expect from the 1.0 E release. 
</p><p>
There was one strange &ldquo;bug&rdquo; that I discovered when clicking on
a file from
my desktop. Instead of defaulting to the Thunar file manager, E's own file
manager opened, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I was humored by the
wiggling icons, but the total experience is not finalized. It
lacks a certain appeal&mdash;that look of completeness. I can understand
why Thunar was chosen in its place. Perhaps EFM should be removed from
OpenGEU entirely.
</p><p>
OpenGEU is different enough to be noticed by family and friends. It's
easy to use, simple to install and fanatically fun. You can expect E's
total functionality with animations, fading and shadows. I used
OpenGEU for quite some time for the purpose of this review, and
it is the most pleasant E experience I encountered. This is one
distribution
I'll definitely be watching, and it's the distribution from which I am
writing this review. 
If you are looking for the ultimate E experience, try OpenGEU. You won't
be disappointed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eac580.0x239e078"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
E17 is under heavy development and probably not useful for
business purposes. However, it's ready for personal use, especially for
those with older PCs that could stand to be revived. System requirements
for E are extremely low, with dazzling 2-D effects rivaling the best of
Compiz Fusion without the need for an up-to-date graphics card.
Completely rewritten using EFL, E is not like any other window manager or
desktop in existence. It's intended to be the next generation of
desktops&mdash;a desktop shell that sits somewhere between window manager and
 full-fledged desktop. E is not for everyone, but for most users, E
should be a pleasant experience. And, it's lightning fast to boot. 
I hope that Linux users, old and new alike, will come to recognize that
there's more to Linux than just KDE and GNOME.
