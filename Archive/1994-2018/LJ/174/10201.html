Evaluating the condition of sound and music production software.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d52a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this second part of my survey of Linux audio development, I
focus on the application side of things. 
I would have liked to have included many other tools and applications, but time and space
always are in short supply. So, my apologies if your favorite program isn't
listed; feel free to let me know what you think I'm missing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d5460"></a>
Music Production</h2></div></div><p>
People coming to Linux from the Windows/Mac world of commercial sound
and music software might think they've stepped backward in time. Linux
audio and MIDI production software usually is not as visually attractive
as the rainbow of products advertised in the major music magazines, but
most musicians will agree that the sound is the thing. In that regard,
Linux can stand tall and even can claim some colorful packages of its own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d55c0"></a>
Simple Production</h2></div></div><p>
ALSA supplies command-line utilities for simple recording and playback of
audio and MIDI. These tools (arecord/aplay and arecordmidi/aplaymidi) are
useful for quick uncomplicated purposes, and most distributions provide
GUIs to ease their use. At the next level, LMMS (Linux MultiMedia Studio;
Figure 1) and Jokosher are good examples of desktop music production
software designed in the manner of Apple's popular Garage Band. They engage the user quickly with colorful uncomplicated GUIs,
but they are quite powerful within their design constraints. Both programs
are in current development and have active communities of users and
developers. Wouter Boeke's AMUC (Amsterdam Music Composer) is another
less-weighty program that includes many attractions for the desktop
composer, including an integrated synthesizer, notation capability
and very light resource requirements.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10201f1.large.jpg"><img src="10201f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Complex Production</h2></div></div><p>
Ardour dominates the professional-grade category of serious recording
tools for Linux. Paul Davis continues to lead Ardour's programming
team, and the project remains one of the finest examples of Linux
audio software development. Ardour 2.5 is a mature application, and the
developing Ardour 3.0 promises to bring the program to a new level, thanks
especially to Dave Robillard's work on its new MIDI recording and editing
capabilities. No strict timetable exists for Ardour's releases, and I
certainly can't predict when 3.0 will make its public debut. However,
Ardour's development track record is well defined, with a consistent
series of releases, so I hope we may see it before year's
end. Of course, SVN sources are available to anyone who wants to test
the cutting edge while waiting for the public release.
</p><p>
Smaller but still powerful alternatives are available. Rui Nuno Capels'
QTractor is a multitrack/multichannel DAW (digital audio workstation) with
a design similar to the portable studios in the digital audio hardware
world. QTractor also distinguishes itself by its support for natively
compiled Linux VST plugins, along with the usual complement of LADSPA
and DSSI plugins. Remon Sijrier's Traverso employs a highly efficient
interface, is very easy to use and provides a complete production system,
from recording your first tracks to burning an audio CD.
</p><p>
Kai Vehmanen's Ecasound occupies a unique position in the Linux audio
software world. Ecasound is a command-line DAW, a complete audio recording
and processing solution that requires no graphics displays. It runs in an
interactive mode or can be driven by user-composed scripts; it is fully
JACK-aware; it records in multichannel modes&mdash;the list of Ecasound's
capabilities stretches on and on. Ecasound is a long-lived project,
and I'm happy to report it's still developed and maintained by
its original author.
</p><p>
Fervent Software's Rosegarden is another venerable Linux music application
with a long and healthy development track. Rosegarden always has supported
common-practice notation as a composer's interface, and its developers
now plan to strengthen that interface further. Given its JACK support,
there's little need for Rosegarden to repeat all the duties of a DAW,
and it's a win for notation-based composers to have their notation-based
GUI JACK-sync'd to the DAW of their choice.
</p><p>
Developer Werner Schweer has moved his MusE audio/MIDI sequencer in
the opposite direction&mdash;he has removed its notation interface and 
refocused that code into the MuseScore program (see below). Meanwhile,
MusE continues to evolve as a dedicated audio/MIDI sequencer, and version
1.0 is currently in alpha release.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d5b40"></a>
Production Helpers</h2></div></div><p>
Consider the common studio scenario of a MIDI sequencer driving two or
three softsynths whose output is directed into Ardour. When your work is
done, you can save each application to its current state, but there's no
easy way to recall every component to its session state upon re-opening
the project and its parts. The LASH software provides an elegant solution
to that problem, but its adoption has been slow. Client applications
must include direct support for LASH, and so far, developers have been
focused on other problems. Nevertheless, the project remains active, the
client list grows, and I hope to see wider adoption of LASH throughout
the Linux audio development community.
</p><p>
Mastering is a process normally associated with the post-production
stage of a recording project. When mastering a project, track levels
are balanced and the final touches of compression and EQ are applied
to add that touch of audio perfection before burning the master
disc. Fortunately, Linux can claim an excellent mastering utility, the
JAMin program designed by Steve Harris and developed with help from
a talented crew of Linux audio programmers. JAMin's last major release
(0.95.0) dates from 2005, but the project already is mature and continues
to show intermittent CVS activity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d5cf8"></a>
Synthesizers and Samplers</h2></div></div><p>
Many older softsynth projects (amSynth, ALSA Modular Synth and ZynAddSubFX)
are unmaintained and in need of attention. The synths mentioned above sound
great, but they could all benefit from amenities, such as current compiler
optimizations, LASH support, JACK support and so on.
</p><p>
Significant synths in current development include Ingen (LADSPA/LV2/DSSI
plugin-based synth), QSynth (soundfont2 synthesizer) and FMS (modular
synthesis). Recently, a new crop has appeared with some very unusual
approaches to synthesis methods and GUI design. Malte Steiner's
Minicomputer is a powerful subtractive synthesizer with eight monophonic
&ldquo;pages&rdquo;. Justin Smith's Synth Of Noise is a glitchmeister's dream synth,
and Juan Pedro Bolivar Puente's Psychosynth presents a unique 3-D interface
for creating basic (and not so basic) synthesis networks.
</p><p>
Samplers are represented by Specimen and the LinuxSampler Projects. These
applications differ in some significant ways: LinuxSampler utilizes
files in the GIG format made popular by Tascam's GigaSampler, and Specimen
is happier with soundfile formats supported by libsndfile. LinuxSampler
(Figure 2) is a client/server architecture with at least two GUIs and a
command-line interface. Specimen is a standalone GTK-based application.
LinuxSampler and Specimen both support JACK, but Specimen also supports
ALSA and is a LASH-savvy application. LinuxSampler
has more features associated with the GigaSampler model and is the more
consistently maintained program, but both samplers are useful in the
complete Linux music-maker's studio.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10201f2.large.jpg"><img src="10201f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. LinuxSampler Fantasia GUI
</p></div></div><p>
I also must mention Tapeutape, Florent Berthaut's MIDI-controllable
&ldquo;virtual sampler&rdquo;. Tapeutape has a rich set of features (including LASH
support) and is designed especially for live performance, with or without
a GUI. The latest version of the program is 0.0.5 from April 2007, but
the author has indicated that he's still working on it, and an update
should be released by the time this article is published.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6170"></a>
Drum Machines</h2></div></div><p>
Hydrogen holds its position as the premier Linux drum machine/rhythm
programmer. Its development track slowed for a while&mdash;version 0.9.3,
the current stable release, dates from early 2006&mdash;but work proceeds on
the SVN sources, and community support is active and strong. Version 0.9.4
promises great improvements&mdash;thanks especially to the new stewardship
of Sebastian Moors and his development crew.
</p><p>
Samplers and soundfont players function nicely as drum sound sources
in a MIDI sequencing environment, and drum loops have become a common
method of composing rhythm tracks in the modern DAW. Given these factors,
it's not surprising that few virtual drum boxes are created or maintained
these days. However, the orDrumbox program has a number of interesting
musical features and could be a worthy contender for Hydrogen, though
it will need JACK support first.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d62d0"></a>
Personal DSP/Guitar FX</h2></div></div><p>
Until recently, JACK Rack was the preferred standalone signal processing
system for Linux audio production. That program has many features to
recommend it, including access to the full range of LADSPA plugins
and parameter control with MIDI continuous controllers. Alas, project
development is slow, averaging two releases per year, and no release
has been made yet in 2008.
</p><p>
Linux-based guitarists now have a very fine effects processing system
with Rakarrack, a new system based on effects algorithms culled mainly
from the ZynAddSubFX synthesizer. Version 0.2.0 is available now, and
Rakarrack is in heavy development. Future releases will give Linux
guitarists a more comprehensive instrument-specific effects system,
including cabinet simulations and more effects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6488"></a>
Soundfile Editors</h2></div></div><p>
Many projects in this domain have strong development tracks. Bill
Schottstaedt's great Snd continues to grow nicely, with many enhancements
and fixes from its wide community of users and developers. Younger
projects, such as Audacity (Figure 3), mhWaveEdit and Sweep, show current
development, but unfortunately, the much-anticipated update for ReZound has yet
to materialize, and we still await better JACK integration with Audacity
and Sweep.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10201f3.large.jpg"><img src="10201f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Audacity Soundfile Editor
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6748"></a>
Audio Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
LADSPA, the Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API, is an
excellent resource for audio plugin developers, and users now can enjoy
many fine plugins created with the LADSPA API. Standout sets include
Tim Goetze's CAPS suite, Steve Harris' indispensable SWH package and
Tom Szilagyi's TAPS collection, but many other LADSPA gems are
available. The overall collection continues to expand, albeit slowly.
</p><p>
The intentional simplicity of the LADSPA API necessarily restricted plugin
designs primarily to effects and dynamics processing. The emerging LV2
specification takes LADSPA to the next level, particularly with regard
to instrument plugins. LV2 competes with the DSSI (Disposable SoftSynth
Interface), but the developers of both projects are working toward the
common goal of providing Linux with something like the famous VST/VSTi
plugin architecture for Windows.
</p><p>
Direct support for VST/VSTi plugins currently exists in two forms.
Bridges,
such as FST (FreeVST) and the dssi-vst utility, can run some native
Windows VST/VSTi plugins directly under Linux, while Lucio Asnaghi's
JOST Project works at porting open-source VST plugins to native Linux
versions. Applications with support for VST/VSTi plugins (Windows or
native Linux) include Ardour, Rosegarden, LMMS and QTractor. However,
Ardour's support requires a special build procedure, and the resulting
binary may not be redistributed.
</p><p>
The terms of the Steinberg API forbid the free redistribution of the VST
SDK, so a mature LV2 is likely to be an attractive alternative for plugin
developers. Time will tell, and although the specification is already
a worthy contender, users need plugins. A few projects already address
that need (see the list at <a href="http://lv2plug.in" target="_self">lv2plug.in</a>), but more would be better.
</p><p>
The developers of LMMS have resolved the issue in another way by coding
a drop-in replacement for the needed VST SDK, making it possible to
provide direct VST support without the Steinberg code. This development
is recent, and it remains to be seen whether Linux audio developers will
incorporate that solution into their own programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6a08"></a>
Music Notation Software</h2></div></div><p>
This domain can be divided between programs that function primarily as
a composer's workspace and programs that function as music typesetting
software. The magnificent LilyPond Project dominates the music typesetting
category, and NtEd and Canorus are the best currently maintained
notation-based composition interfaces. However, Werner Schweer's MuseScore
rapidly is evolving into a superb WYSIWYG graphic interface for music
composition, but it requires a cutting-edge installation of Qt and its
other dependencies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6b10"></a>
The Virtual DJ/VJ</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux digital DJ can choose between two professional-grade mixers,
UltraMixer and Mixxx, both of which are beyond their 1.0 releases and
continue to display strong development tracks. Alexander Koenig's great
&ldquo;virtual scratcher&rdquo; terminatorX has not been developed since 2004,
but at version 3.82, it's safe to refer to it as mature.
</p><p>
The digital video jockey (VJ) is well served by the current crop of video
mixers for Linux. Outstanding packages include FLxER, FreeJ, Gephex and
Veejay, all of which work with video files and streams in ways analogous
to the actions of audio disc jockeys. Video input can be scratched,
stuttered, processed with special effects, and mixed with other video
(and other media). Common laptops now are powerful enough to handle the
audio and video resource demands of this evolving art form, especially
if they're running Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24d6cc8"></a>
Broadcasting Software</h2></div></div><p>
The Rivendell Project rules this domain. Rivendell (Figure 4) provides
a complete solution for radio broadcasters (air-wave or network-based)
who want to automate all or any part of their operations. The suite is an
impressive achievement, with a fully professional set of features &ldquo;...for
the acquisition, management, scheduling and playout of audio
content&rdquo;,
according to its Web site. The latest public release is version 1.0,
and the project development status is current and ongoing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10201f4.large.jpg"><img src="10201f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Language-Based Software Sound Synthesis</h2></div></div><p>
Traditional software sound synthesis (SWSS) languages have flourished in
Linux, and the platform continues to attract developers of such systems.
</p><p>
Csound enjoys the attentions of a wide community of users and a core
development group of very talented programmers. The latest release,
Csound 5.08, is a true powerhouse, with an amazing number of synthesis
and processing opcodes, integrated GUI widgets, more complete JACK
support and many other compelling features. The development of the
Csound API has provided a mighty engine for programmers who want to
leverage Csound's capabilities into their own software without having
to rewrite its routines. Jean-Pierre Lemoine's AVSynthesis, Steven Yi's
blue and Rory Walsh's Cabbage Project all depend on the Csound API for
their audio processing functions.
</p><p>
Paul Lansky's venerable Cmix enjoyed continued development in the form
of Dave Topper's superb RTCmix, but it seems that development has
stalled since 2006. RTCmix definitely is worth getting into, and I hope
that its development track will pick up again in the near future.
</p><p>
Bill Schottstaedt's Common Lisp Music (CLM) is another SWSS system
derived ultimately from Max Mathew's legendary Music V. In fact, Bill
recently incorporated Music V into CLM, but that's a trivial task for
such a formidable developer. CLM has been in constant evolution for
probably as long as Csound, and it enjoys the special attention of its
own talented development crew. New releases are frequent and significant,
typically adding new synthesis and processing functions along with
such amenities as an amazing collection of bird-call synthesis routines
and the aforementioned Music V. I also must mention Bill Schottstaedt's
Common Music Notation (a Lisp-based music notation language) and his
great Snd soundfile editor. All of his software is high quality and
consistently maintained, and we are fortunate to have him and his work in
the Linux audio camp.
</p><p>
Notable recent SWSS systems include ChucK, SuperCollider3 and the awesome
Pure Data (Pd). Their modern characteristics include a more contemporary
syntax and support for modern programming techniques, and in some cases,
the language includes an integral (but not mandatory) GUI. ChucK and
SuperCollider3 do not include integrated graphics primitives, but GUIs
have been created for the language or for certain aspects of the language
(for example, TAPESTREA, a fascinating tool for composition that requires ChucK's
signal analysis and synthesis capabilities).
</p><p>
Pure Data deserves some further remarks. The systems I've mentioned here
enjoy wide community support from users and developers, but Pd comes
close to being a religion. It is mightily persuasive, with a variety of
functions and routines that rival Csound, including a fantastic interface
for working with OpenGL via the GEM library. Thanks to its vast resources
(and excellent documentation), Pd can be pressed into virtually any audio,
MIDI or video service.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24cdb88"></a>
Signal Processing/Analysis/Resynthesis</h2></div></div><p>
In Ye Olden Times, the software found under this rubric would have included
only language-based tools, but the scene has changed profoundly. The GUI
is now the sound analyst's favored tool, and we can enjoy some wonderful
software as a result of this focus on the user interface.
</p><p>
The award-winning CLAM Project continues along its innovative path, thanks
to Pau Arumi and the development team at UPF in Barcelona. CLAM is the
&ldquo;C/C++ Library for Audio and Music&rdquo;, designed for rapid development
of sound and music applications. The system includes unique tools and
utilities for audio analysis, synthesis and signal processing, complete
with graphic controls and displays.
</p><p>
GRAME's FAUST is both a language for real-time audio signal processing
and a development environment for DSP programmers writing plugins or
complete applications. FAUST is indeed fascinating software, with a strong
development team and an excellent collection of tools and utilities. I
plan to review FAUST in a future article for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site.
</p><p>
Chris Cannam's Sonic Visualiser (Figure 5) is a program for &ldquo;viewing and
analyzing the contents of music audio files&rdquo;, but that description reveals
little about the program itself. The project intends to provide the best
audio visualisation software for viewing waveform and spectrographic data
representations in forms that can be utilized and comprehended by anyone,
not only audio processing professionals. However, Sonic Visualiser is
no mere eye-candy maker; it is, indeed, a serious tool for studying music
and sound.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10201f5.large.jpg"><img src="10201f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Sonic Visualiser Analyzing a Musical Fragment
</p></div></div><p>
Albert Graef's Pure (formerly Q) is not a DSP environment per se, but
it is obvious from its examples that audio and MIDI applications are
certainly among its major focus points. Additionally, Pure/Q includes
some very cool methods for interfacing with the FAUST and Pd
audio synthesis and processing environments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24ce0b0"></a>
Music Composition</h2></div></div><p>
Linux can claim one of the finest composition environments available to
computer-based musicians, Rick Taube's Common Music. Professor Taube 
has maintained Common Music consistently for many years, and most recently,
he has begun work on an entirely GUI-based environment (GraceCL) for the
system. IRCAM's OpenMusic is another composition-centric program that will
run under Linux, but unfortunately, it is maintained only sporadically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24ce1b8"></a>
Dedicated Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
Linux distributions with an emphasis on multimedia support have flourished
in the past few years. Planet CCRMA, 64 Studio, JAD, Dynebolic and Musix
have reduced the agonies that attend the configuration of a low-latency
high-performance system. Some of those distributions include live disc
images for &ldquo;trying without crying&rdquo;, and other systems, such as Gentoo and
Ubuntu, offer specialized versions of themselves optimized for audio work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24ce318"></a>
Remaining Difficulties</h2></div></div><p>
Despite the many advances in the Linux audio world, some
irritating difficulties remain. The mainstream distributions have not yet agreed
upon a common sound server, and they may never do so. Hardware support
still is disappointing, especially in the pro-audio domain, and licensing
issues continue to plague some projects. Nevertheless, many difficulties
have been ameliorated or done away with entirely, as developers continue
to work toward greater usability on the Linux desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23dd580.0x24ce420"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
I began working with Linux in 1995, when only a few
dozen decent audio/MIDI applications existed for Linux. I'm happy that we
now have such a cornucopia of programs, despite their varying
quality, and I see good signs indicating continuance of many of
those programs. Obvious targets for improvement include more pervasive
support for JACK and the LASH session handler, standardization of the
preferred sound server for normal users, and more direct driver support
from hardware manufacturers. Some changes will come easily, and some will
be troublesome, but it's in the nature of Linux to confront and conquer
such difficulties. Meanwhile, I'm using Linux to produce my own media
creations and enjoy them along with the works (commercial and otherwise)
of others. Good things are happening around me now, and I see more
good things coming down the road. Whatever they may be, 
I'll be sure to let you know about them here in the pages of 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and on LinuxJournal.com.
