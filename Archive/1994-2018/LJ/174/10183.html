Insights from SUSE's Security Team Lead.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0xf2e460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently, after receiving one of SUSE's regular security-update e-mail
messages,
it occurred to me that people who track security vulnerabilities for Linux
distributions really are in the front lines of Linux security. I
have the luxury of examining one command here, one architecture there,
but these people track threats and vulnerabilities for <span   class="emphasis"><em>entire operating
systems</em></span>.
</p><p>
And, for a moment, I was fearful. What if this occurs to my editors,
who might reach the obvious conclusion that the Paranoid Penguin really
ought to be authored by a real expert, like SUSE Security Team
Lead Marcus
Meissner, rather than this goofball Mick?
</p><p>
But, of course, if they fired me, I'd be forced to release those photos I
took of them back in 2003 on the Linux Lunacy cruise, and nobody wants
that to happen. Think of the disillusionment and embarrassment,
not to say indigestion, this might cause! I, for one, do not wish to be
party to such a vile media circus.
(Unless that party features the TCP/IP Drinking Game, like at Def
Con&mdash;good times! Then again, that's the kind of thinking that landed my
editors in this pickle.)
</p><p>
So, you're stuck with me for the foreseeable future, gentle reader. But,
take heart! This month you get both me and wisdom: Marcus Meissner
graciously agreed to an interview, in which we talked about practically
every major topic in Linux security I could imagine.
</p><p>
As you can see, Marcus has useful and interesting insights on all of
these topics. Read, learn and enjoy.

Introduction</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Thanks so much for taking the time to
chat with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>! By way of introducing you to our readers, I'd like to start
with a question or two about your background.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10183f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Marcus Meissner
</p></div></div><p>
MM: Thank you for interviewing me!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Could you describe your duties at SUSE as Security
Team Lead?
</p><p>
MM: My duties as Security Team Lead are mostly overseeing
security-related work done for the SUSE Linux/OpenSUSE product lines. My
team has three people and one trainee currently, so there still is time left
for myself to be involved in the groundwork.
</p><p>
What my team does can be split into two parts: reactive work and
proactive work.
</p><p>
Reactive work is what you know of as coordinating security updates for
security incidents for the products currently under support. This involves
reading mailing lists, watching the bug tracker, watching the internal
update release processes and giving answers to packagers, QA and others
wanting to know about the updates.
</p><p>
Proactive work consists mostly of reviewing security-related changes for
future products, adding new security features for those and, of course,
actively reviewing and auditing source code for flaws and fixing them.
</p><p>
My typical day is mostly lots of communication spread over the whole
day: reading and answering e-mail, instant messages, phone calls and, of
course, meetings. All this is done mostly to get the above-listed security
tasks taken care of, so there are not specific phases of the day.
Occasionally,
I still do some programming and handling of the packages I maintain in
the distribution.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
You started out at SUSE on its PowerPC Maintenance Team,
right? Why did you go to the Security Team?
</p><p>
MM: Historically, I had been working in the security field already
in my last year (2001) at Caldera. After coming to SUSE, there was no need
for another security engineer there, so I had different tasks. I started
out doing various non-PowerPC-related development my first year at SUSE,
but gravitated in the end to the PowerPC Development Team.
</p><p>
In 2004, however, I wanted a bit more responsibility, and then SUSE started
looking for a lead for the Security Team. So, the offer of interesting
work, more responsibility and my first people management job got me into
it in the end.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Do you have any formal training in information
security? (This is sort of a trick question: many of my most accomplished
colleagues are mostly self-taught.)
</p><p>
MM: Portions of it I got from university, such as basics on
cryptography, protection models like Bell-LaPadula and information leaks
via side channels.
</p><p>
But, most of my information security training was on the job and by self-education, because it was not very high on the list of must-haves in the
universities in the middle of the 1990s.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
How has your background in software development informed
your work as a security professional?
</p><p>
MM: Lots of the low-level work of security in the Linux
distribution area is actually bug fixing and helping others design
and write good code to avoid bugs. So, yes, my background in software
development was a must for this job.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0xf2f1c8"></a>
Secure Coding</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> In my own day job at the bank, I frequently interact
with software developers who have very little understanding of security
or of secure coding. Although ignorant is the last word that I, being a
humble nonprogrammer, would use in this context, it seems that security
has not traditionally been an important part of programming culture and
training. Have you found that to be the case yourself? Has this situation
changed in recent years?
</p><p>
MM: I have found this to be the case, yes. In former times,
it was mostly &ldquo;get things working&rdquo;. Now, it is a bit better. Everyone
knows about viruses, worms, trojans and so forth. However, it is not optimal yet;
the hard part is convincing people that their code might be exposed to
such problems.
</p><p>
I am regularly hearing, &ldquo;but then it will just be broken into the user
account, not root&rdquo; or &ldquo;it will run behind the firewall
here&rdquo; as excuses.
But, I see definite improvements.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> We seem to be stuck in an endless parade of security
vulnerabilities in the full range of applications on which we depend&mdash;graphics
editors, compression libraries, server d&aelig;mons, even security tools. I
think some of us assumed that over time, as security awareness in the
development and user communities increased, the rate of security bugs
would decrease. Why, do you think, it hasn't? Or, is this rate, in fact,
decreasing?
</p><p>
MM: This has several factors at play.
</p><p>
First, the classes of problems have changed due to security research
over time.
</p><p>
The trivial exploit technologies, like stack and heap overflows and format
string problems, are explored and can be captured by technology today,
and programmers understand them.
</p><p>
But, integer overflows still are an uncharted sea for most&mdash;&ldquo;Why is there
a difference between 'signed' and 'unsigned'? Why is this multiplication
bad?&rdquo;&mdash;and are hard to find using today's compiler technology.
</p><p>
The new kind of applications on the Web has brought entirely new
problems for things like SQL injection, command injection, cross-site
scripting and others. Due to the startup boom, lots of those applications
were not designed with security in mind. Here, the easy Web development
languages are a bit at fault too&mdash;on one hand, allowing beginners to
develop applications easily, but on the other hand, making it trivial to make mistakes.
</p><p>
Also, the increased integration of the network and Internet has
brought more code up to the light, as in &ldquo;can now be accessed from the
network&rdquo;. Just think of all the image libraries written with a
command-line
local user in mind that now run as a back end to Web galleries.
</p><p>
I personally see no reduction of security problems in the near future. At
most, it will level off.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
It might seem non-intuitive for developers of non-networked
desktop applications, like gPhoto, to have to worry about security. But, of
course, such applications frequently are used as stepping-stones
in attacks against other processes and for gaining access to system
data or other local resources. Do you ever find yourself lecturing other
developers on threat scenarios like that?
</p><p>
MM: Hmm, not for gPhoto or Wine at least, but for other
distribution-related packages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0xf2fa08"></a>
Application Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> What changes, especially improvements, have you seen
lately in application architecture? What changes would you like to see?
</p><p>
MM: I see different languages being used, which bring
different architecture concepts. The trend away from C toward Java,
C#, Ruby and so on with stricter typing is helpful.
</p><p>
I would like to see people not re-inventing/reprogramming everything
existing anew, but trying more to reuse existing, proven code.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
How do you think the race to Web-oriented application
architectures has affected application and operating system security?
</p><p>
MM: It makes securing the process more difficult. As an
OS vendor, we now are just one part of the chain&mdash;the secure base system
used to browse the Web.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Is it just me, or has the emergence of cross-site scripting
(XSS) added a whole new dimension to the security landscape? I don't
remember many pre-Web attack vectors that allowed you to use one person's
server to attack other users. The older paradigm was that you attacked
the system, not the users per se.
</p><p>
MM: Definitely, the advent of Web applications has brought
new problems, and seeing that there still are dozens of XSS issues fixed
per week shows that the problems are not contained yet.
</p><p>
And yes, when interacting between the network, the user is way more
interactively involved than before. Consider phishing problems, for
instance, which even though they fall under social engineering, do endanger
system security.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
How has the emergence of Web services affected the SUSE
Security Team's work? Is it easier to isolate and address bugs in Web
applications, which are usually written in scripting languages, than in
compiled applications?
</p><p>
MM: Fortunately, not much, as we do not include very
many. Quite a lot of fixes went into the PHP core packages in the last
few years, and the Web applications we include had their share of problems.
</p><p>
What we also shipped is an increasing rate of Web browser security fixes,
as the browsers now get good reviews too. More than a hundred Mozilla bugs
were fixed in the last few years, for instance.
</p><p>
As for isolating and addressing bugs, it's still at the same difficulty
level. You need to understand the code and fix the problem. Also, as
we usually back-port patches, we need to understand those, and there the
language does not matter much. Plus, Web applications usually are not
smaller than regular programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0x1328288"></a>
Operating System Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
In the Linux world, we've seen less malware (viruses,
trojans and worms) than the Microsoft Windows world has been subject to. Why
is this, do you think?
</p><p>
MM: First, Microsoft Windows just has more installations,
and so it is a more valuable target; thus, it gets more research into
exploitability.
</p><p>
Second, Windows has quite a high integration level. You can do lots
of stuff from everything, and this was seen as good thing&mdash;easy embedding
of document/image viewing and so on. Although on the one hand, this is a good
thing, it also exposes a lot more code to the attackers.
</p><p>
Plus, the Windows software development community before the Internet
was not really programming with security in mind, and so there were
large holes.
The same goes for reviewing the code; it was hard without source for
externals.
</p><p>
It's something like a mix of all those things, I guess.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
My own opinion for several years has been that Linux isn't
inherently more or less secure than Windows; their underlying security
models are very similar. What are your thoughts on this?
</p><p>
MM: UNIX/Linux has, for example, the advantage that we
separated (the concept of) the user from the administrator right from beginning,
which Windows still has problems with.
</p><p>
Due to less integration, or integration at different levels, Linux has
perhaps a better chance of resisting those attacks.
</p><p>
Linux also has less of a monoculture in programs and libraries, and it
is also more rapidly changing than perhaps on Windows.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
What kind of potential do you see in mandatory access
control (MAC) systems, like AppArmor and SELinux, in improving Linux
security for the masses? To what extent do you think they're already
helping?
</p><p>
MM: It's difficult to say. I have no experience with SELinux,
but with AppArmor, I see a bit of acceptance issues in default settings,
and then it does not catch everything.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
When SUSE incorporated Novell AppArmor into its general
releases, this caused a bit of controversy. It seemed like some people
involved with SELinux felt that this undermined their efforts. As a SUSE
employee, I assume you're pro AppArmor, but what do you think about the
controversy? Isn't it healthier for multiple MAC options to be available
to people?
</p><p>
MM: There surely was controversy, but most of it seems to
have died down now.
</p><p>
It is healthier to have more than one MAC system, especially in exploring
the MAC problem from different angles.
</p><p>
That AppArmor was much more usable than SELinux also has caused lots of
thinking and usability improvements in SELinux (think targeted policies,
booleans and so on), and the other way around. AppArmor now can contain more
things than in earlier times.
We currently see both as solutions that even could co-exist to some
degree.
</p><p>
Other new MAC approaches, like SMACK and so forth, also are appearing now.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
So, are there any plans for SUSE to support SELinux,
as an alternative to AppArmor?
</p><p>
MM: I cannot say at this time, especially since partner
requirements are still open for future products.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0x1328b78"></a>
Virtualization</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
When Linux virtualization first started to emerge into
the mainstream a few years ago, it seemed to me that the whole concept
of a hypervisor&mdash;an intelligence logically above the guest-OS kernel
that manages system resources and monitors VM behavior&mdash;has a lot of
security potential. Nowadays, I wonder whether I wasn't overly optimistic.
The additional layer of abstraction might introduce other attack
vectors. Your thoughts?
</p><p>
MM: Virtualization environments, unfortunately, were/are sold
as security solutions, but the breakout possibilities are only now being
investigated, and there likely was no formal containment design from
the ground up.
</p><p>
Several ways also have been found for almost all virtualization
technologies to break out of confinement.
</p><p>
So yes, I think its being used as security containers is overly
optimistic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0x1328e38"></a>
Embedded Linux</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
One of the most remarkable developments in Linux, it seems
to me, is its rapid inroads in the embedded systems market. All kinds
of consumer electronic devices are now Linux-powered. Does SUSE ever
show up in this space? Do the particular challenges and ramifications
of embedded operations figure into your team's work?
</p><p>
And, from a security perspective, how good of an idea is it to use a
general-purpose operating system like Linux (or Windows) for embedded
applications?
</p><p>
MM: We are not really showing in this space, even though
we are working to bring the enterprise desktop more into the thin-client
space. But, it's not the real embedded market.
</p><p>
What matters most for security in those devices is how they get updates
and what security processes are there from their vendors. If the vendor just
gives up support after six months for a device, but the device lives for
five years or longer, it's bad. You have lots of unpatched devices out there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe36580.0x13290a0"></a>
Cryptography and Identity Management</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Your team, of course, digitally signs its
communications. But 17 years after Phil Zimmerman gave us PGP, only a
tiny percentage of ordinary users employ any kind of e-mail encryption. Any
thoughts as to why, and what to do about it?
</p><p>
MM: It's too hard to use and, more so, too hard even to understand
why to use cryptography.
&ldquo;Why does Aunt Emily need to encrypt letters to her niece Tina? Who
cares about them anyway? And, how do I do it?&rdquo;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Maybe the real issue here is identity management. We
haven't yet figured out any kind of universal identification on the
Internet, which is part of the problem space that PGP, S/MIME, x.509
and LDAP are all supposed to address. But the paradox is that although
such an identification infrastructure would greatly simplify all sorts
of security problems&mdash;single sign-on, directory services, encryption
and the like&mdash;the technology itself is very complicated.
</p><p>
MM: Yes, definitely.
Perhaps a hardware solution might help here&mdash;something that Aunt Emily
and niece Tina could physically exchange and so would physically grasp.
</p><p>
One could imagine doing premade USB tokens that can be torn off a strip
and distributed for every family member involved, in a size that fits
in regular letters.
Or, using cell phones to pass encryption keys back and forth, as everyone
owns cell phones now.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span>
Any time you talk about centralized identity management in
the US, for which the logical starting point is the federal government,
the discussion gets very strange very quickly. Americans are reluctant
to trust their government not to abuse this information (which is
perhaps strange given that they've got all sorts of information about
us already). Are things different in Europe?
</p><p>
MM: They are better. People trust the government more,
because they already hand out our passports and ID cards. But, with the
current government trying to enter into our privacy more and more, I
think even in Germany we will see more mistrust.
