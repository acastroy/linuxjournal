Falcon is based
on an open coding approach that seamlessly merges procedural,
object-oriented, functional and message-oriented programming.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf3f250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In late 2003, I had the problem of making business-critical
decisions and performing maintenance actions in real time, analyzing data
that was passing through the servers I was charged with controlling.
Data throughput was on the order of thousands of messages per second,
each of which was made of complex structures and possibly nested
maps, whose size was measured in kilobytes.
</p><p>
The applications in charge of those controls were already almost complete,
and they were heavily multithreaded by design. The only thing missing
was the logic-processing engine. That would have been the perfect job
for a scripting language, but the memory, CPU, threading,
responsiveness and safety constraints seemed to be a hard match.
</p><p>
After testing the available solutions, I decided to try to solve the
problem by writing a scripting language from the ground up, taking into
consideration those design constraints. After the decision was made to
move forward, useful items commonly found missing from other scripting
languages were added to the design specification. So, Falcon
mainly was designed from the beginning to meet the following requirements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Rapidly exchange (or use directly) complex data with C++.
</p></li><li><p>
Play nice with applications (especially with MT applications) and
provide them with ways to control the script execution dynamically.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide several programming paradigms under the shroud of simple,
common grammar.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide native multilanguage (UTF) support.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a simple means to build script-driven applications, easily
and efficiently integrated with third-party libraries.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As soon as I was able to script the applications that drove the
initial development and meet these ambitious targets in terms of
overall performance, I realized that Falcon may be something
useful and interesting for others also, so I went open source.
</p><p>
The project is now reaching its final beta release phase, and Falcon
has become both a standalone scripting language and a scripting
engine that can drive even the most demanding applications.
</p><p>
The Falcon programming language now is included with many high-profile
distributions, including Fedora, Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo and others.
If your distribution doesn't include it yet, you can download it from
<a href="http://www.falconpl.org" target="_self">www.falconpl.org</a>, along with user and developer documentation.
</p><p>
Falcon currently is ported for Linux (32- and 64-bit), Win32 and Solaris
(Intel). Older versions work on Mac OS X and FreeBSD. We are porting the
newer version shortly, and a SPARC port also should be ready
soon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf3fa90"></a>
The Language</h2></div></div><p>
Falcon is an untyped language with EOL-separated statements and code
structured into statement/end blocks. It supports integer math (64-bit)
natively, including bit-field operators, floating-point math,
string arrays, several types of dictionaries, lists and MemBuffers
(shared memory areas), among other base types and system classes.
</p><p>
Morphologically, Falcon doesn't break established conventions, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function sayHello()
  printl( "Hello world!")
end

// Main script:
sayHello()
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run this script by saving it in a test file and feeding it
into Falcon via stdin, or by launching it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ falcon &lt;scriptname.fal&gt; [parameters]

</pre>
</p><p>
We place great emphasis on the multiparadigm model. Falcon is based
on an open coding approach that seamlessly merges procedural,
object-oriented, functional and message-oriented programming. We're also
adding tabular programming, sort of a multilayer OOP, but we don't
have the space to discuss that here. Each paradigm we support is
generally a bit &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; to allow for more comfortable programming
and easier mingling with other paradigms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf3fda8"></a>
Falcon Procedural Programming</h2></div></div><p>
Falcon procedural programming is based on function declaration and
variable parameters calls. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function checkParameters( first, second, third )
  &gt; "------ checkParameters -------"
  // "&gt;" at line start is a short for printl
  if first
     &gt; "First parameter: ", first
  end

  // ... and single line statements
  // can be shortened with ":"
  if second: &gt; "Second parameter: ", second
  if third: &gt; "Third parameter: ", third
  &gt; "------------------------------"
end

// Main script:
checkParameters( "a" )
checkParameters( "b", 10 )
checkParameters( "c", 5.2, 0xFF )
</pre>
</p><p>
You can use RTL functions to retrieve the actual parameters passed to
functions (or methods). Values also can be passed by reference (or
alias), and functions can have static blocks and variables:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function changer( param )
  // a static initialization block
  static
     &gt; "Changer initialized."
     c = 0
  end

  c++
  param = "changed " + c.toString() + " times."
end

// Main script:
param = "original"
changer( param )
&gt; param           // will be still original
changer( $param ) // "$" extracts a reference
&gt; param           // will be changed
p = $param        // taking an alias...
changer( $param ) // and sending it
&gt; p               // still referring "param"
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, RTL functions can be used to determine whether a parameter was
passed directly or by reference.
</p><p>
The strict directive forces the variables to be declared explicitly
via the def keyword:

<pre     class="programlisting">
directive strict=on

def alpha = 10 // we really meant to declare alpha
test( alpha )  // call before declaration is allowed

function test( val )
  local = val * 2   // error: not declared with def!
  return local
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Falcon has a powerful statement to traverse and modify sequences. The
following example prints and modifies the values in a dictionary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dict = [ "alpha" =&gt; 1,
  "beta" =&gt; 2,
  "gamma" =&gt; 3,
  "delta" =&gt; 4,
  "fi" =&gt; 5 ]

for key, value in dict
  // Before first, "&gt;&gt;" is a short for "print"
  forfirst: &gt;&gt; "The dictionary is: "

  // String expansion operator "@"
  &gt;&gt; @ "$key=$value"

  .= "touched"

  formiddle: &gt;&gt; ", "
  forlast: &gt; "."
end

// see what's in the dictionary now:
inspect( dictionary )
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the string expansion operator in the above code. Falcon
provides string expansion via naming variables and expressions and
applying an explicit @ unary operator. String expansions can contain
format specifiers, like <tt  >@ "$(varname:r5)"</tt>, which
right-justifies in five
spaces, but a Format class also is provided to cache and use
repeated formats.
</p><p>
Both user-defined collections and language sequences provide iterators
that can be used to access the list traditionally. Functional
operators such as map, filter and reduce also are provided.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf40278"></a>
Falcon Object-Oriented Programming</h2></div></div><p>
A Falcon script can define classes and instantiate objects from them,
create singleton objects (with or without base classes) and apply
transversal attributes to the instances. The provides keyword checks
for properties being exposed by the instances:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// A class
class Something( initval1, initval2 )
  // Simple initialization can be done directly
  prop1 = initval1
  prop2 = nil

  // init takes the parameters of the class
  // and performs more complex initialization
  init
     self.prop2 = initval
     &gt; "Initializer of class Something"
  end

  function showMe()
     &gt; "Something says: ", self.prop1, "; ", self.prop2
  end
end

// A singleton instance.
object Alone
  function whoAmI()
     &gt; "I am alone"
  end
end

// an instance
instance = Something( "one", "two" )
instance.showMe()

//"Alone" is already an instance
if Alone provides whoAmI
  Alone.whoAmI()
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Falcon has a Basic Object Model (BOM), which is available in all the items.
Objects and classes can override some methods. For example, passing an
item to the &gt; print operator causes its toString BOM method to be
called, and that can be overridden as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
object different
  function toString()
     return "is different..."
  end
end

&gt; "the object... ", different
</pre>
</p><p>
Falcon supports multiple inheritance, but it disambiguates it by forcing
inheritance initialization and priority, depending on the order of the
inheritance declarations.
</p><p>
Classes also support static members that can be shared between objects
of the same class and methods with static blocks that can work as
class-wide initializers. Methods can be retrieved and also called
directly from classes when they don't need to access the self
object, providing the semantic of C++/Java/C# static methods.
</p><p>
It is possible to merge normal procedures with methods by assigning
procedures to properties:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function call_me()
  if self and self provides my_name
     &gt; self.my_name
  else
     &gt; "Sorry, you didn't call me right."
  end
end

object test
  prop1 = nil
  my_name = "I am a test!"

  function hello()
     &gt; "Hello world from ", self.my_name
  end
end

// normal calls
call_me()

// using the procedure as a method
test.prop1 = call_me
test.prop1()

// or a method as a procedure
proc = test.hello
test.my_name = "a renamed thing"

// see: proc will dynamically use the right "self"
proc()
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf405e8"></a>
Attributes</h2></div></div><p>
Attributes are binary properties that can be either present or not
present for a specific instance or object, regardless of its class.
</p><p>
Attributes have a great expressive power, and in Falcon, they indicate
what an object <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>, what it <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span>
and what it <span   class="emphasis"><em>belongs to</em></span>, depending on
the context.
For example, we can define a ready attribute that indicates the
objects ready for elaboration:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// declaring an attribute "ready"
attributes: ready

class Data( name )
  name = name

  function process()
     &gt; "Processing ", self.name, "..."
  end
end

// create 10 processors
processors = []
for i in [0:10]
  processors += Data(i)
  if i &gt; 5: give ready to processors[i]
end

// work with the ready ones
for d in ready
  d.process()
end
</pre>
</p><p>
RTL provides several functions to manipulate attributes.
</p><p>
The has and hasnt operators check for the presence of an
attribute. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
attributes: ready
class SomeClass
  //... other class data ...
  // born ready!
  has ready
end

item = SomeClass()
if item has ready
  &gt; "Item was born ready!"
end
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf40a08"></a>
Functional Programming</h2></div></div><p>
The base construct of Falcon functional programming is the callable
sequence, also known as Sigma. At the moment, the only sequence
supported is the array, but other types of sequences (such as lists)
should be supported soon.
</p><p>
Basically, a Sigma is a delayed call that can work like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function test( a, b, c )
  &gt; "Parameters:"
  &gt; a
  &gt; b
  &gt; c
end

// direct
test( "one", "two", "three" )

// indirect
cached = [ test, "four", "five", "six" ]
cached()
</pre>
</p><p>
The call respects the procedural paradigm (variable parameters), and
the array is still a normal vector that can be accessed and modified
through the standard language operators and RTL functions.
</p><p>
This delayed call is still not a full &ldquo;functional context
evaluation&rdquo;.
The proper functional evaluation process is called Sigma
reduction. It recursively resolves Sigmas from inner to outer and
left to right when they are at the same level, substituting them with
their return value.
</p><p>
Special functions known by the VM as Etas start and control
functional evaluation; the simplest Eta function is eval(), which
initializes and performs a basic Sigma reduction.
</p><p>
For example, the expression &ldquo;(a+b) * (c+d)&rdquo; can be written in a
Lisp-like sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function add( a, b ): return a+b
function mul( a, b ): return a*b

&gt; "(2+3)*(4+5)= ", eval(.[mul .[add 2 3] .[add 4 5]])
</pre>
</p><p>
The .[] notation is shorthand for array declarations whose
elements are separated by white space instead of an explicit
&ldquo;,&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Falcon RTL comes with a rich set of Etas, such as iff (functional if),
cascade (which joins more standard calls in a single sequence), floop
and times (different styles of functional loops), map, filter, reduce
and many others.
</p><p>
Functional sequences can be parameterized through closure and
references. For example, the above example can be made parametric in
this way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// add and mul as before...
function evaluator( a, b, c, d )
  return .[eval .[mul .[add a b] .[add c d]]]
end

tor = evaluator( 2,3,4,5 )
&gt; "(2+3)*(4+5)= ", tor()
</pre>
</p><p>
Traditional functional operators, such as map, filter and reduce, are
supported, but the out-of-band item system expands their
functionality.
</p><p>
Out-of-band items are items marked with a special flag through the
oob() function. Although they are normal items in every other
aspect, this special mark indicates that they hold unexpected, special
or somehow extraordinary value traveling through functional sequences.
Although this is not a direct support for monadic calculus, monads can
be implemented at the script (or binary module) level through this
mechanism.
</p><p>
Falcon also supports Lambda expressions and nested functions.
</p><p>
We currently are working on some extensions to make Sigmas even more
configurable&mdash;for example, parameter naming (similar to Lisp field
naming) and access from the outside to the unbound variables used in
the sequence.
</p><p>
Falcon functional programming merges with OOP, as Sigmas can be set as
object properties, and object methods can be used as Kappas (Sigma-callable header symbols):

<pre     class="programlisting">
object SomeObj
  a_property = 10
  function myProp( value )
     return self.a_property * value
  end
end

&gt; "5*10=", eval( .[SomeObj.myProp 5] )
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf37a80"></a>
Message-Oriented Programming</h2></div></div><p>
Because attributes are a very flexible means of declaring dynamic
Boolean properties and a set of &ldquo;similar&rdquo; objects, we have used them as
the main driver for message-oriented programming.
</p><p>
Basically, objects and instances with a certain attribute can
receive messages built for that attribute's holders. The target objects
will receive messages through a method named after the attribute.
</p><p>
The rest of the message-oriented programming support is built on this basic
mechanism&mdash;message
priority queues, automatic event dispatching, inter-agent messaging
services and so on.
</p><p>
As a minimally meaningful sample would require 50&ndash;100 lines (messages
are among many agents), we'll skip it here, and try to explain
what's nice about message-oriented programming.
</p><p>
The main point is that you can summon remote execution in unknown objects
willing to participate in the message without direct knowledge of
them.
Messages can carry anything, including methods or whole Sigma
sequences for remote execution in foreign objects.
</p><p>
Messages don't even need to be point to point. The message receivers
cooperatively can form a reply by adding something to the forming
return value. For example, a central arbiter can send a
&ldquo;register&rdquo;
message, and every object willing to register can add itself to a
queue of items willing to register in a queue traveling with the
message. The queue even can contain target register procedures to be
invoked by the arbiter once the register message processing is
complete.
</p><p>
An example that easily displays the power of this paradigm is the
implementation of an assert/retract/query mechanism.
</p><p>
A central object registering assertion listens for messages of these
three types. Any part of the program then can send an assertion, a
name bound with executable code, which can be anything, including
code generated dynamically or loaded from plugins. Items in need of
some algorithm can then query the system (sending a query message)
asking for it to be provided.
</p><p>
If available, the code is returned, and it can be invoked by the
agents in need of it.
</p><p>
You also can do this through a global dictionary, where code is
associated with algorithm names, but that approach requires all 
users of the code to know the central dictionary and to interact with
it. Asking a smoke cloud to take care of arbitrating the code
repository is easier, simpler, more modular, more flexible and allows
for central checking and managing. When that comes at no additional
performance cost because of the language integration, it's an obvious
advantage.

Some Things We Didn't Say</h2></div></div><p>
Stuffing all the things that Falcon can do for you into a short
article is not easy, mainly because the things some will find useful
may be useless for others. We didn't discuss co-routines, the indirect
operator, the upcoming tabular programming, the reflexive compiler,
the Falcon Template Document system (our active server pages), the
multithreading module or many other things we've done and are
doing to make Falcon the best language we can.
</p><p>
A DBI module already is available for interacting directly with MySQL,
Postgre and SQLite3, and ODBC and Firebird will be ready soon too. A
module for SDL is standing, and we're starting to work on a generic
binding system to provide full support for Qt, GTK, GD2 and many other
libraries.
</p><p>
We are still a small group, and the language specifications are still open.
So, if this project interests you, and you want to add some binding
or test some paradigm/language idea, we welcome you.
