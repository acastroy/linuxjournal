Droopy
(<a href="http://stackp.online.fr/droopy" target="_self">stackp.online.fr/droopy</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
First up this month, we have Droopy, a miniature Web server. Now, if you're
like me, and the combination of seeing the words Linux and Web server usually
results in a sleep-induced coma, fear not. This actually is more useful
for average Internet users. Its sole purpose is to allow other people
to upload files to your PC by presenting them with a Web page interface,
and its requirements are about as minimalist as I've come across.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10192f1.large.jpg"><img src="10192f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
With Droopy, you can lose the limitations of annoying transfer programs
with your very own mini-Web server.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Thankfully, Droopy has only one real requirement&mdash;Python. As 99% of you
already have that installed, we can jump right into
this one. Droopy itself is merely a Python script, so all you need do is
head to the project's Web site, and save the droopy file to your local
hard disk. You will be running Droopy through the command line, mind you,
so save it to a directory that will be easy to access via the command
line. The Droopy Web site recommends making the directories ~/bin and
~/uploads, and saving the droopy file to ~/bin.
</p><p>
Once you've done this, it's time to run the script. If you made
the uploads directory, open a terminal there before running the
script. This isn't a requirement, but wherever you run the
script, this is where any uploaded files you receive will go.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The Droopy site and man page have an example command that inserts
a greeting message and displays a picture as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python ~/bin/droopy -m "Hi, it's me Bob. You can 
 &#8618;send me a file." -p ~/avatar.png
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have Droopy installed somewhere other than ~/bin, change to path
to wherever the droopy file is sitting now. If, like me, you're not
called Bob, change the name (you also might want to use a less goofy
message). The picture isn't a requirement, but it can help identify
your page. It needn't be avatar.png either, any image file will do.
</p><p>
Once the script is running, you can visit a mini-Web site from
any browser at http://localhost:8000/.
</p><p>
If all is well, you should have something that resembles the
screenshot shown here. This is all well and good, but people need to upload to
you. Clicking Discover the address of this page will give you
a URL that you can then pass on to your friends, so they now can upload to
you, provided the script is running. To upload to one of these pages,
there's a rather obvious empty text field with Browse and Send
buttons sitting next to it that will allow the people uploading to
choose the file they want and send it to you. Once they have sent it,
a notification should appear on your terminal output, and the new file
will be sitting in your uploads directory.
</p><p>
Not being a security expert, I imagine there's probably some sort of
vulnerability here (this most likely would be catastrophic on Windows),
but I couldn't give any real advice in that regard. Personally, I don't
have a mission-critical enterprise system, so I'm not exactly worried
myself, but dig around if you're concerned. All in all, Droopy is a
clever piece of scripting that is easy to install and fairly easy to use,
provided that you're not scared of the command line. For those put off by
transfer methods, such as IRC, MSN clones and the like (and not forgetting
pesky e-mail size limits), this may be just what you're chasing.

safe-rm
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/safe-rm" target="_self">code.google.com/p/safe-rm</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
With the advent of sudo and an increasing number of new Linux users,
the possibility of users deleting mission-critical files by accident is
becoming all the more real. To deal with this issue there is now safe-rm:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
safe-rm is intended to prevent the accidental deletion of important files
by replacing /bin/rm with a wrapper that checks the given arguments
against a configurable blacklist of files and directories that should
never be removed. Users who attempt to delete one of these protected
files or directories will not be able to do so and will be shown a
warning message instead. Protected paths can be set both at the site
and user levels.
</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing safe-rm is a pretty rudimentary affair. You basically just
copy one file to the right place. To begin, head to the Web site
and grab the latest tarball. Extract it, and as root, copy the safe-rm
file to /usr/local/bin, and rename it to rm.
</p><p>
Make sure the file is flagged as readable and executable for the rest
of the system (as root or sudo): 

<pre     class="programlisting">
# chmod a+rx rm
</pre>
</p><p>
If this doesn't work, you may want to make a backup of the original rm
in /usr/bin and then copy and rename safe-rm here. This will make your
system use safe-rm in place of rm. Of course, you could leave the
filename as is and enter safe-rm every time you want to delete a file,
but who wants to do that?
</p><p>
As for usage, just use <tt  >rm</tt> the same way you always have, but with the
warm and fuzzy knowledge that you're not going to kill your system or
accidentally cause nuclear war. Overall, safe-rm is a useful and clever
modification on an age-old tool that hopefully will make its way into
mainstream distros soon.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span>
(<a href="http://launchpad.net/freenukum" target="_self">launchpad.net/freenukum</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Ah, now for a bit of nostalgia. If your idea of vintage gaming is a
Nintendo 64, you probably won't have a clue what I'm talking about. But,
for those who are from the era of at least the 286, you no doubt will
remember such classics as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander Keen</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jetpack</em></span> and, of course,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Duke Nukum</em></span>. If you're thinking <span   class="emphasis"><em>Duke Nukum
3D</em></span>, then think again. That
was a remake of this! This was back in the days of the 2-D platformer,
and when Commander Keen was king, this came along as a sort of Team
America version&mdash;rude, crude and supposedly violent (but very tame by
today's standards).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10192f2.large.jpg"><img src="10192f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The now tame but classic <span  class="emphasis"><em>Duke Nukum</em></span> restored with
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
With these old classics fading into obscurity and requiring a lengthy
explanation from wizened geeks like myself, enter
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span>, a restorative
Linux version on which to waste more office hours. An authentic reconstruction,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span> makes use of (and requires for the moment) the original level
files to bring back the same feel of this classic platformer.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
The actual program installation is a very straightforward affair, with
various binaries available or source code. The source is quite minimal,
requiring only the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ab580.0x29a47a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Compilation took only a few seconds on my system, and the configure script
didn't give me any complaints.
</p><p>
With the compilation out of the way, you still have one more step
before you can run the game. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span> currently requires the original
level files to run, so you need to get a copy of the original from
somewhere. Either the shareware version or the full version will work,
so Google around and find a host that suits you. Of course, there
are abandonware sites, but we aren't encouraging that sort of thing.
</p><p>
Once you have downloaded the original, copy the game's files into the
directory ~/.freenukum/data (if you're a bit stuck here and using a
graphical file manager, turn on Show Hidden Files). If it's not there,
simply create the directories, and everything should be tickety-boo. If
you're pedantic about keeping a tight system, a lot of those files aren't
needed, but this game was made back in the day of the 286, so the game
isn't exactly big. I just copied the whole game.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once all that's out of the way, to run it, enter the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ freenukum
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you're in the main menu, press the S key to start a new game. Left
and right arrow keys control your directional movement, and the up
arrow key is used to activate things such as platforms, switches
and so on. The left Ctrl key is for jumping; the left Alt key is
for shooting, and that's pretty much it&mdash;things were simple back in
those days! Check the man page for further info on which items do what and
further info on the game itself (type <tt  >man freenukum</tt> at the console).
</p><p>
At its current state, some things aren't implemented in the menu yet,
such as instructions or the high-score table, so you'll definitely need
that man page. Even so, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span> still is in a
pretty solid state, and
it's very playable. Project author Wolfgang Silbermayr made me promise I'd
mention that he's looking for some graphic and level designers to help make
some original level files to include with the game by default. Once this
happens, it'd be great to see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freenukum</em></span> included in distro repositories.

Projects at a Glance</b></p><p> 
I'm going on a petrol head stint this month and have picked up three
cool looking projects for you fellow gas guzzlers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
MegaTunix</b></span> (<a href="http://megatunix.sourceforge.net" target="_self">megatunix.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
For any ECU tweakers out there with Subaru-colored pajamas, Japanese
Drift videos and a Colin McRae embroidered duvet, this is the program
for you. Mega Tunix is &ldquo;...the only tuning software for UNIX-
(and now Win32-) class operating systems that supports all existing
megasquirt firmwares&rdquo;. MegaSquirt is apparently &ldquo;an
open-source EFI controller for internal combustion engines, comprised
of embedded software, tuning software and various build and deployment
tools&rdquo;. For those readers who are still following me, the MegaTunix
developers claim to have the most complete and accurate ECU interrogation
of any project out there. The latest versions have been redesigned to
be extensible further to support new firmware variants, and the GUI is
broken down into lovely little tabs. Neat.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10192f3.large.jpg"><img src="10192f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
ECU trickery just got neater with lovely little tabs. And my goodness,
there are a lot of them.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Vamos</b></span>
(<a href="http://vamos.sourceforge.net" target="_self">vamos.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
Vamos is a very young project concentrating on being &ldquo;an automotive
simulation framework with an emphasis on thorough physical modeling and
good C++ design. Vamos includes a real-time, first-person, 3-D driving
application&rdquo;. It also includes a number of cool real-world locations,
with tracks such as Germany's Nurburgring and Japan's Suzuka
Circuit, among others. However, this won't be a major draw card of
authenticity just yet, as the graphics are still at a level comparable
to a 286, and the cars resemble something more like what Postman Pat would
drive. As a result, the project's author is inviting anyone to contribute
to the effort. Still, it looks promising, especially as parts of its code
are being borrowed from another project.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10192f4.large.jpg"><img src="10192f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

van!
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
VDrift</b></span>
(<a href="http://vdrift.net" target="_self">vdrift.net</a>)
</p><p>
Powered by the just-mentioned Vamos engine, &ldquo;VDrift is a cross-platform,
open-source driving simulation made with drift racing in mind&rdquo;,
and it's currently available for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows
(Cygwin). Although the game is in an early development stage, it is
supposed to be very playable and quite feature-packed, with 19 tracks
(including the Nordschleife track), 28 cars, AI players, &ldquo;very
realistic physics&rdquo; and a (simple) multiplayer network mode. Initial
screenshots look a little rudimentary at times, but seriously
sweet at others. I look forward to playing this one and hope to have an
in-depth view of both Vamos and VDrift over the coming months.
