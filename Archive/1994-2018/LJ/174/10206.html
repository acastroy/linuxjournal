Bernard Golden's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Source in the Enterprise</em></span>
(O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
Is open source right for your company? A new resource from O'Reilly
may help you decide. Dubbed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Source in the
Enterprise</em></span> and written
by Bernard Golden, this O'Reilly Radar Report is for CIOs, IT managers
and business owners who want to make smart decisions about deploying
open source. The study not only outlines open source from a business
perspective, but it also presents three action plans to help companies
effectively increase its use. Downloadable in PDF format, both individual
and five-user site licenses are available.

Gunter Dueck's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lean Brain Management</em></span>
(Springer)</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Intelligence is wasted on problems that themselves have been caused by
an excess of intelligence&rdquo;, says author Gunter Dueck in his new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lean
Brain Management</em></span> from Springer. This satirical book seeks to transform
society to minimal intelligence everywhere possible. For example,
after 30 minutes of &ldquo;Googling&rdquo;, any human can talk intelligently on any
topic. With this book, Dueck presents a radical suggestion for world
improvement. The desire to laugh about the consistent economization
of intelligence eventually will hopefully segue into a collective
rude awakening. In keeping with the theme, the book is written in an
easy-to-read fashion. It contains no self-doubt whatsoever.

CherryPal C100 Computer</h2></div></div><p>
While your desktop PC is greedily gulping 114 Watts of power, the newly
released CherryPal C100 cloud computer will do the same work with
98% less&mdash;only 2 Watts. CherryPal, Inc., says that its new creation
has no moving parts, contains 80% fewer components, is highly secure
and runs a customized version of Debian. No maintenance is required,
as most information is processed and stored off-site in the so-called
CherryPalCloud. The CherryPal also offers a new single software layer
technology, which collapses the operating system and browser into
one layer. The single layer makes the CherryPal exponentially faster,
says its maker, and it virtually eliminates the risk of bugs or viruses for
the user. The CherryPal sports Freescale's MPC5121e mobileGT processor,
256MB of DDR2 DRAM and a 4GB NAND Flash-based solid state drive.

Vyatta Series 2500 Open Networking Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
The IT appliance sector is having its own Cambrian explosion, fueled

Appliance line. The line of networking appliances is &ldquo;designed to meet
the connectivity, security and protection demands of medium to large
enterprises&rdquo;. The Vyatta 2501, the first appliance available in the

workloads across clusters and supercomputers. Star-P is an interactive
parallel computing platform that allows scientists, engineers and
analysts to create algorithms and models on their desktops using familiar

Software Workshop's ExtSQL</h2></div></div><p>
Enriching the vast MySQL ecosystem is the new ExtSQL, short for Extended
usage statistics for SQL. The product is designed to provide DBAs with a
simple tool for monitoring database activity by individual user, database,
host or even connection. Software Workshop asserts that present
SQL monitoring tools allow only gross monitoring at the server level.
ExtSQL provides extra detail, including historical data, and makes it
available from the command line. The ExtSQL server is designed to be
a drop-in replacement for an existing mysqld or postmaster executable.
