Remove JavaScript event handlers from HTML files using Prototype and
Lowpro.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd80580.0xe78358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
JavaScript has gone through a number of changes in the past few years.
Implementations have become faster, more standardized
and more stable. The development and growth of open-source JavaScript
libraries, such as Prototype and Dojo, has helped mask many of the
remaining differences between JavaScript implementations, such as with
AJAX and event handling. The final change has occurred in the minds
of developers (including myself), who now approach JavaScript as a
serious application development language, rather than as a toy for
highlighting images or doing simple effects.
</p><p>
Most JavaScript is executed not when it is initially read into a
browser window, but rather when a particular event takes place. The
easiest, and most common, way to assign event handlers is inside 
the HTML itself. For example, we can create a submit button for an
HTML form as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form method="POST" action="/action"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit the form" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
When a user clicks on this button, the browser submits the contents of
the form to the URL specified in the form tag's action attribute,
using the method specified in the method attribute. But, we can
change this by adding an onclick attribute to the submit button:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form method="POST" action="/action"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit the form"
           onclick="alert('hello!'); return false;" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
With the onclick handler in place, the button now opens a
JavaScript alert box (saying &ldquo;hello&rdquo;). Moreover, because our
event-handler definition returns false, the form will not be
submitted.
</p><p>
Of course, we don't have to put our JavaScript literally in the event
handler. We could define a function somewhere else&mdash;in the
document's &lt;head&gt; or perhaps in an external JavaScript file
altogether:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form method="POST" action="/action"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit the form"
           onclick="do_something(); return false;" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, none of this is new. But, there are problems associated with
setting event handlers in &ldquo;on___&rdquo; attributes. For one, it
becomes difficult to assign more than one handler to the same event on
an object.
</p><p>
A second and more significant reason is that our HTML
becomes full of JavaScript. Until a few years ago, it wasn't unusual
for HTML to be mixed in with code and style information as well,
but the growth of strictly separated MVC frameworks have removed
most code from the HTML, and style information now is put in external
CSS files.
</p><p>
A growing movement during the past few years has pushed for &ldquo;unobtrusive
JavaScript&rdquo;. Proponents of unobtrusive JavaScript argue that by
placing JavaScript in a separate file and by defining event handlers
in a separate file, the code becomes easier to read and understand and
is cached by the browser. By using JavaScript unobtrusively, we also
have the opportunity to make our HTML pages degrade gracefully,
continuing to work with browsers that don't support JavaScript.
</p><p>
This month, we look at unobtrusive JavaScript and
the unobtrusive approach to defining functions and event handlers. We
also examine the Lowpro library that works with the popular
Prototype JavaScript library, allowing us to write JavaScript that is
unobtrusive, clean and easy to read.

Observing Events</h2></div></div><p>
Above, I showed how to assign a piece of JavaScript (called
&ldquo;do_something&rdquo;) to an event on a particular HTML element. A
fuller version of this HTML form, as well as some more content and
tags, is shown in Listing 1 (test.html). This file contains a
simple hyperlink, as well as our form.

   to The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;form method="POST" action="/action"&gt;
       &lt;input type="text" name="text_field" id="text_field" /&gt;
       &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit the form" id="submit_button" /&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
I've already discussed how to handle an onclick event by setting the
onclick attribute. However, there are at least two other methods
for setting this event handler. One is to set the onclick
attribute through JavaScript, treating onclick as a property of the
DOM element associated with the hyperlink or button. Using
Prototype's $() function, we can write:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').onclick =
            function() { alert('clicked!'); return false; }
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the event handler is an anonymous function, similar to
&ldquo;lambda&rdquo; in Ruby and Python or an anonymous subroutine in Perl.
The event-handling function can take an optional argument, whose value
will be an event object. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').onclick =
            function(event) { alert(event); return false; }
</pre>
</p><p>
With this alternate code in place, the alert (in Firefox, at least)
indicates that the event was an &ldquo;object MouseEvent&rdquo;. This object, like
all objects in JavaScript, then has a number of properties we can
query. For example, the pageX and pageY properties indicate the X
and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor when the event took place. We
can see these by specifying the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').onclick =
            function(event) { alert(event.pageX + ", " +
                              event.pageY); return false; }
</pre>
</p><p>
Each click on the link will give a slightly different result,
depending on the coordinates of the mouse cursor at the time of the
click.
</p><p>
Of course, we also can define non-anonymous functions as our event
handlers:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function show_x_and_y(event) {
    alert(event.pageX + ", " + event.pageY); return false;
}

$('hyperlink').onclick = show_x_and_y;
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that our assignment is to show_x_and_y (that is, the name of a
function), rather than to show_x_and_y() (that is, the result of
executing the function). This is a particularly useful technique if
we want to assign the same function to handle multiple events.
</p><p>
We can handle a number of different events. For
example, the onmouseover and onmouseout events let us execute
a function based on when the mouse starts or stops pointing to a DOM
element. Thus, we can do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').onmouseover =
            function() { $('the_form').hide(); }
$('hyperlink').onmouseout =
            function() { $('the_form').show(); }
</pre>
</p><p>
When the mouse points to the hyperlink in test-2.html (Listing 2), the HTML form
disappears. When the mouse moves away from the link, the form
reappears. This might not be especially useful, but it does
demonstrate the sorts of events (and event handlers) we can
define.

   &lt;form method="POST" action="/action" id="the_form"&gt;
     &lt;input type="text" name="text_field" id="text_field" /&gt;

   &lt;/form&gt;

 &lt;script&gt;
   function show_x_and_y(event) {
       alert(event.pageX + ", " + event.pageY); return false;
   }

   $('hyperlink').onclick = show_x_and_y;

   $('hyperlink').onmouseover =
               function() { $('the_form').hide(); }
   $('hyperlink').onmouseout =
               function() { $('the_form').show(); }


 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
</pre></div><p>
Assigning events in this way has some advantages over using the
onclick and related attribute-based event handlers. It lets us
define all of our event handlers in a single place&mdash;typically at the
end of the HTML file. Thus, we have some separation between our HTML
and JavaScript.
</p><p>
But, what if we want to go one step further, putting all our
JavaScript into a separate file? Listing 3 shows a new version of our
HTML file, now called test-3.html. Instead of having the JavaScript
at the bottom of the page, I put it in a separate file, called
atf-events.js (Listing 4). However, if you try to load this file, you
quickly will discover that it doesn't work. We get a JavaScript error
upon loading the file (clearly evident and readable if you're using
the wonderful Firebug debugger for Firefox), telling us that
$('hyperlink') is null.

     &lt;input type="text" name="text_field" id="text_field" /&gt;
     &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit the form" id="submit_button" /&gt;

$('hyperlink').onmouseover = function() { $('the_form').hide(); }
$('hyperlink').onmouseout = function() { $('the_form').show(); }
</pre></div><p>
How can this be? If you look through Listing 3, you still will see an
HTML element with an ID of hyperlink. And, we definitely
have included the Prototype library, so $() should work. How can it be,
then, that $('hyperlink') returns null?
</p><p>
The answer is subtle, but well known to JavaScript programmers:
$('hyperlink') is available only after the HTML element with an ID of
hyperlink has been loaded. Because our JavaScript file was loaded (in
the &lt;head&gt; of the document) before the hyperlink element was
defined, JavaScript threw us an error.
</p><p>
One solution to this problem is to load our JavaScript at the end of
the file, right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. Another possibility is to
define all of our event handlers in a function that itself is 
executed only after the entire document is loaded. In other words, we
define a function (set_event_handlers) that defines all of our event
handlers. Then, we attach this function to the window.onload event,
which executes only after the entire document has been loaded. The
code, shown in Listing 5, is exactly the same as Listing 4, except the
functionality is wrapped in the set_event_handlers function, which is
invoked based on an event.

Events in Prototype and Lowpro</h2></div></div><p>
Our event handlers are now unobtrusive. However, there still are some
problems associated with them. For example, what happens if we want
to assign multiple handlers to a single event? That is, what if we
want to execute not one function, but two, for $('hyperlink').onclick?
In our current paradigm, we don't have any options; to have two
functions execute, we need to wrap them both into a single function
and then make that single wrapper function the event handlers.
</p><p>
This isn't much of a solution, particularly if we are loading
third-party libraries that might want to attach handlers to one or
more events. Instead, we need to use a different paradigm&mdash;one
that lets us attach a handler to an event, rather than set the
handler.
</p><p>
Prototype lets us do this with the observe method, which is
available to any extended element&mdash;including those returned by the
$() and $$() functions. So, we can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').observe('click', show_x_and_y);
</pre>
</p><p>
Because of the way that Prototype's observe method works, we can
attach multiple handlers to a single event:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$('hyperlink').observe('click', show_x_and_y);
$('hyperlink').observe('click',
            function() { alert('yay!'); return false;});
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, because this code still depends on the existence of
$('hyperlink'), we still need to wrap it in a function that is then
attached to window.onload. (We also can attach our function to the
dom:loaded event, which fires before window.onload, but the idea
is the same.)
</p><p>
An alternative solution is to use the Lowpro JavaScript library,
which provides functions that facilitate easier writing of unobtrusive
JavaScript.
</p><p>
By loading lowpro.js (after Prototype, but before any code that will
use Lowpro), we gain access to the Event.addBehavior method, which
lets us attach one or more events to any CSS selector. Listing 6 is a
slight rewrite of our HTML file to include lowpro.js, and Listing 7
shows how we can set our event handlers using Event.addbehavior:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Event.addBehavior({
     '#hyperlink:click' : show_x_and_y,
     '#hyperlink:mouseover' : function() { $( 'the_form' ).hide() },
     '#hyperlink:mouseout' : function() { $( 'the_form' ).show() }
});
</pre>
</p><p>
We see that Event.addBehavior is a function that takes a single
parameter, a JavaScript object (which we can think of as a hash).
Each of the object's keys combines a CSS selector (#hyperlink in
this case) with the name of an event, with a colon separating the two.
Note that the event name does not include a leading &ldquo;on&rdquo;. So what
would be the onmouseover handler is called mouseover for
Event.addBehavior.

   &lt;title&gt;Unobtrusive JavaScript&lt;/title&gt;

     &lt;input type="text" name="text_field" id="text_field" /&gt;

Event.addBehavior({

         '#hyperlink:mouseover' : function() { $( 'the_form' ).hide() },
         '#hyperlink:mouseout' : function() { $( 'the_form' ).show() }
   });
</pre></div><p>
As you can see in Listing 7, Event.addBehavior automatically wraps
our event-handler definitions in code that waits for the entire page
to load. So, we no longer need to set document.onload, for example.
</p><p>
Finally, the CSS selector code means we can set events on
multiple elements simultaneously. If we want all paragraphs, or all
table headers or even all images, we can do that quickly and easily
with Lowpro. Lowpro allows us to reduce the amount
of event-handling code that we write dramatically, keeping it in a single location and removing it from the HTML file where we might have first
considered putting it.
</p><p>
I should add that Lowpro used to include DOM-manipulation routines as
well, allowing us to add and modify page elements using a variety of
convenience functions. However, recent versions of Prototype include
this functionality already, allowing Lowpro to stick to behavior
not addressed by Prototype.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Unobtrusive JavaScript is an increasingly popular style for working
with JavaScript, particularly when it comes to defining event
handlers. Prototype makes it easier to work with events than with raw
JavaScript, but the Lowpro library makes it even easier than that.
With Lowpro, it becomes quite simple to assign event handlers to any
combination of elements in our document, without having to clutter up
our HTML page or worry about when the page has loaded.

David Flanagan's <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em></span> is an excellent
resource for JavaScript programmers, including both a tutorial and a

provides useful
advice on which parts of JavaScript we should avoid. Both books are
published by O'Reilly. My opinion (and use) of JavaScript has
improved dramatically since reading Crockford's writing, letting me
concentrate more on writing code and less on problems associated with
the specification or implementation of JavaScript.
