Programming languages aren't languages per se. You
can't go out into the street and say, &ldquo;print 'Hello,
world!\n';&rdquo; to
passersby without raising the occasional curious eyebrow. In the right
crowd, however, that might work as well as boldly proclaiming
&ldquo;naDevvo'
yIghos&rdquo; in a roomful of Klingons. It's all in how you say it and
to whom.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b16580.0x1c0e510"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois! Our guests will be here any moment, and you are sitting
back watching old <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> episodes! Yes, I know that
the Klingons in
the original series look different from how they do now, but why are you
watching television when there is work to be done? As much as I enjoy
the original series....<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Yes, of course, it is
silly to show
every alien race as speaking English. It happens in most science fiction
and in most fiction, for that matter. Having the characters on television
spend weeks or months learning the basics of a language before getting
down to action would make for pretty boring television. And, people
constantly would have to invent new languages for us to hear. Yes,
I know many people speak Klingon, but that's different. We will
discuss this later, Fran&ccedil;ois. I can see our guests at the door.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. Your tables await, and
Fran&ccedil;ois was just turning off the television, weren't you <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>? Please, sit and make yourselves comfortable while my
faithful
waiter fetches the wine. There's a case of 2006 Cuv&eacute;e Bacchus Pfaffenheim
Gewurztraminer in the cellar's north wing. You remember,
Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;right
next to the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics tablets.
</p><p>
The world has numerous languages. Some languages are spoken by
millions. English, for example, is perhaps the most popular language,
spoken by countless billions throughout the galaxy&mdash;a little joke,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Other languages are more obscure, and some,
although still
spoken, are nearly forgotten or relegated to the pages of history. Then,
there are the imaginary languages, which, amazingly, sometimes have
a great many speakers&mdash;like Pig Latin or Klingon. Originally only
a few words invented by Marc Okrand for the 1979 movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek:
The Motion Picture</em></span>, Klingon now boasts tens of thousands of
speakers
worldwide. The language is championed by the Klingon Language Institute.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please, pour for our guests. Enjoy,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. This Gewurztraminer is a full-bodied white
with deep
fruit flavors, a nice floral bouquet and just a hint of spiciness. Don't
forget my glass, Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>
Where was I? Ah...Klingon is unique in that it originally
was an imaginary language. Google, as we all know, runs thousands of
Linux servers to do its magic, and in performing those searches, it tries
to support as many languages as possible&mdash;including Klingon. For a
Klingonese Google start page (Figure 1), visit <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/xx-klingon" target="_self">www.google.com/intl/xx-klingon</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10193f1.large.jpg"><img src="10193f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Google
offers a start page for those who are fluent in Klingon.
</p></div></div><p>
If you happen to be among those who speak Klingon, you might want
to check out tlhaq, the Klingon clock, at Two Brothers Software
(Figure 2). This graphical clock displays the time textually and
numerically, using, of course, Klingon characters. Even if you can't
speak the language, it's a pretty cool addition to the desktop, worthy
of a warrior. Visit <a href="http://tlhaq.twobrotherssoftware.com" target="_self">tlhaq.twobrotherssoftware.com</a>
and download the package.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10193f2.large.jpg"><img src="10193f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. tlhaq,
the Klingon clock&mdash;I'm not even going to pretend I know what time
it is.
</p></div></div><p>
This is a binary distribution, so there's no compilation required. You
need the SDL_image and SDL_ttf packages installed on your system,
however. Create a directory called tlhaq (or kclock, if you prefer),
and extract the tarred and gzipped bundle:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir kclock
cd kclock
tar -xzvf kclock.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
From that directory, you simply can run the <tt  >tlhaq</tt>
binary. When
the clock is running, you can use some single keystrokes to modify
its behavior. For instance, the S key toggles the text for the seconds on
and
off. Pressing + or - increases or decreases the font size. Should you
find the text difficult to read, press F to switch between different
font types (it still will be in Klingon though). If you want tlhaq to
remember
your settings, press C to save them.
</p><p>
I alluded to the idea that programming languages are, if not imaginary,
at least artificial languages. Combining Klingon with programming hasn't
escaped some Klingon enthusiasts. For instance, Unicode support for the
Klingon language was added to the Linux kernel. Seriously. If you don't
already have the Linux kernel source installed on your system, do so, and
then check out the included file called
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/unicode.txt.
</p><p>
Given this Linux Klingon support, there's var'aq, the Klingon
programming language created by Brian Connors. He describes var'aq
as &ldquo;PostScript with a dash of Lisp thrown in&rdquo;. Hmm...one
wonders if Brian has ever worked in a kitchen. A programming language
for warriors, var'aq can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq" target="_self">www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq</a>. Once you have it,
extract the programming source. This is a zip file, which you can extract
in the following way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
unzip varaq-current.zip
</pre>
</p><p>
Once done, change to the varaq directory, and start the interpreter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl varaq-engl
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can start varaq in the native Klingon language version if
you happen to speak Klingon:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl varaq-kling
</pre>
</p><p>
var'aq is an unforgiving language. As if you would expect
otherwise. There is no prompt to provide hints, but var'aq has no trouble
telling you when you are wrong. Documentation is provided, so you can
start writing your own operating system should you so desire. You
might want to start with the classic &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; program,
keeping in
mind that Klingons don't say hello:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"nuqneH 'u'?" cha' pong
</pre>
</p><p>
The English version might make a little more sense:


<pre     class="programlisting">
"What do you want, Universe?" disp name
</pre>
</p><p>
All programming languages, some might argue, are essentially fancy
adding machines. On that note, you can use var'aq to discover the nature
of the universe:

<pre     class="programlisting">
52 10 boqHa' cha'
</pre>
</p><p>
This most certainly looks like the right place to take a break and
have Fran&ccedil;ois refill our glasses. While you enjoy that lovely wine, let
me direct you to another imaginary language&mdash;one of the very first
learned
by English-speaking children. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yesay, itway'say igpay
atinlay</em></span>. Pig Latin,
as most kids will tell you, is as simple as taking the initial consonant,
putting it at the end of the word, and adding ay to it. In that way,
Linux becomes Inuxlay and Cooking becomes Ookingcay. Easy, huh? If you
want to write large amounts of text in Pig Latin, it can, however, become
fairly tedious. Luckily, there's a great little program to help do the
job. It's called pig, and it comes with the classic bsdgames package
(or bsd-games, in some distributions). To translate large phrases into
Pig Latin, simply type <tt  >pig</tt> at the command line, then
type the
phrase you want translated:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pig
Linux is the world's greatest operating system.
Inuxlay isway ethay orldway'say eatestgray
 operatingway ystemsay.
</pre>
</p><p>
On a similar note, that same package comes with another tool for
speaking in tongues. It's called rot13, and this is how you use it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rot13
Linux is cool redefined.
Yvahk vf pbby erqrsvarq.
</pre>
</p><p>
As it turns out, rot13 is actually a cypher, albeit a very simple
one. It takes the letters of a word, such as linux,
and changes it by moving 13 letters forward (or backward) in the
alphabet. In that way, linux becomes yvahk. To translate from rot13,
simply re-enter the encrypted phrase using the same command. If you break
the alphabet up into two rows of 13 letters, it's extremely easy
to see how rot13 works:



<pre     class="programlisting">
abcdefghijklm
nopqrstuvwxyz
</pre>
</p><p>
Also in that bsd-games package is a translator for the computer world's
most powerful language, acronyms. The program, wtf (which no doubt
stands for &ldquo;What's that frase?&rdquo;) can help you decipher those
strange
words you find scattered on IRC and inside instant-message
conversations. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wtf rotfl
ROTFL: rolling on the floor laughing
</pre>
</p><p>
Cool, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Although, it's arguably nowhere near as
cool as the greatest
imaginary language of all time. I'm talking about mock-Swedish.
</p><p>
The greatest (and funniest) television Chef of all time is without
a doubt the Swedish Chef from the legendary Jim Henson's brilliant
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Muppet Show</em></span>. If you never have watched the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Muppet Show</em></span>, please, do
yourself a huge favor and buy yourself the DVD boxed set. You
won't regret it. But, as I have been known to do from time to time, I
digress...the Swedish Chef was funny largely in part because of his
rather strange form of mock-Swedish&mdash;that and his hilarious antics and
over-the-top recipes. Nevertheless, many thousands of people have, over
the years, attempted to duplicate the language of the Swedish Chef. Now,
your Firefox browser can bring the experience to any page you visit.
</p><p>
Firefox is an excellent browser on many counts, but one of its coolest
features is the ability to add features and capabilities through a system
of add-ons and extensions. Extensions are program enhancements that
can change how you work with your browser dramatically. This framework
of extensions makes Firefox not only a great browser, but also a superior
browser. To experience Firefox extensions, click Tools on the menu bar
and select Add-ons.
</p><p>
A window labeled Add-ons appears with a list of buttons to access
installed extensions, themes and plugins already on your system. On a
fresh install, there usually isn't much here. Most likely, the Get
Add-ons button will be highlighted with a selection of recommended
add-ons listed in the larger pane below. You can choose to add the
recommended extensions, browse through a rather huge list of other
extensions, or type something in the search bar to narrow the search. What
does all this have to do with the Swedish Chef? Let me tell you.
</p><p>
Type <tt  >bork</tt> in the search box, and press Enter. The
dialog should
display Anthony Howe's &ldquo;Bork Bork Bork!&rdquo; extension along with
a
description (Figure 3). There's also a nice, friendly button labeled
Add to Firefox.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10193f3.large.jpg"><img src="10193f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The
Firefox Add-ons dialog not only gives you access to installed extensions,
but it also lets you search for many others.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click that button, a new window appears asking for
confirmation before going ahead and installing the extension (Figure
4). There's also a warning about installing malicious software. If you
are comfortable with your choice, click the Install Now button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10193f4.large.jpg"><img src="10193f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Do you know where that extension has been? Even so, installing it
is
merely a click away.
</p></div></div><p>
That's it. Once the extension is installed, you'll see a message appear
above the description telling you to restart Firefox
before the extension actually can take effect. Firefox also provides
a handy Restart Firefox button. Once the browser comes back to life,
the Add-ons dialog appears once more to confirm that you have indeed
installed the &ldquo;Bork Bork Bork!&rdquo; extension. Now, when I surf to
a Web site,
such as <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>, I can right-click on
the page and
select View Bork Text from the menu. In a few seconds, my page is
translated into something only the Swedish Chef could understand (Figure
5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10193f5.large.jpg"><img src="10193f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Once borked,
Web text becomes something only the Swedish Chef could understand.
</p></div></div><p>
Another way to bork the text is to click View on the menu bar and
select Bork text. To return your browser to a normal view, simply repeat
the process and uncheck Bork text.
</p><p>
Sadly, the clock tells us that our time for speaking in various strange
tongues is nearly over. Yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it's closing
time. If you
need to have Fran&ccedil;ois refill your glasses, which he will do happily,
remember that he only understands English and French. Asking for a
refill in Klingon is likely to frighten him. Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
raise your glasses, and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
