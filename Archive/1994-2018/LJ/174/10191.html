Reading Dave Taylor's excellent article on extracting movie
information from IMDb for a Twitter movie trivia game
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, July
2008], I could not help but think, &ldquo;why doesn't he ...&rdquo;, on several
occasions. To put my money where my mouth is, I rewrote his code
snippets as a&mdash;IMHO&mdash;more readable bash script using more concise
code snippets. Here it is:


<pre     class="programlisting">

PREFIX='http://www.imdb.com'
  CHART="/chart/top"

 function get_top_250_chart ()
 {
   wget -O - "$PREFIX/$CHART" \
     | grep -E -o "$TITLE" \
     | sed 's!^!'"$PREFIX"'!'
 }

 function get_movie_and_year ()
 {
   wget -O - "$1" \
     | grep '&lt;title&gt;' \
     | sed -r 's!^.*&gt;(.*)&lt;.*!\1!' \
     | sed -r 's!\(([0-9]{4})(/(I{1,3}|I?V|VI{1,3}|I?X))?\)$!| \1!'
 }

 for URL in $(get_top_250_chart); do
   get_movie_and_year "$URL"
 done

 # vim: set ft=sh tw=70 sw=2 sts=2 et:

</p><p>
Also, this version correctly parses&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Crash
(2004/I)&rdquo; is changed to
<tt  >"Crash | 2004"</tt>.

I gave renewing a lot of thought this time around. You see, it used to be
automatic, but you folks seem to be catering primarily to the software
crowd. That's okay, but spread yourselves a bit more freely, please. I am a
hardware engineer and would appreciate some more from that side of the
house. After thinking long and hard, I decided to give you one more try for
one year. You see, I actually found that I am looking forward to my issue each
month; it's just that the programming stuff is hard to get exited about
after many years in hardware. I'm sure I am not alone.

In the Letters section of the last few issues, there has been mention of
Linux being used in different consumer products. Today, while surfing the
Web looking for a new car stereo, I came across the SoundStream VIR-4100N,
which is listed on the Web site as a &ldquo;4.3"-wide Touch Screen, Din Size,
In-Dash, Fully Motorized TFT Monitor, with Navigation/DVD/AM/FM&rdquo;. The
third bullet, in a long list of features, says &ldquo;OS 2.6.x Linux-based
software, 400MHz processor for fast recalculation times&rdquo;.

Regarding Dan Sawyer's review of the Cradlepoint PHS300 [titled &ldquo;Hot

issue:
the CTR350 does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> come with a battery, which is what
separates it from the PHS300.
</p><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b6fb8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b6fb8"></a>SATA RAID Problems</h4><p>
In response to the article &ldquo;One Box. Sixteen Trillion Bytes&rdquo;
by Eric Pearce in the August 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>:
I also was excited about the prospects of using larger, cheaper, SATA RAID
solutions to cut costs on our ever-growing storage needs. I'm not saying
it's a bad idea, but there are problems that are not apparent until after
you make the investment. These problems can be dealt with, and I dare say
that a niche market is waiting on someone to do this, but I've seen other
companies fail to do it in the past.
</p><p>
The key problem that does not show up until later is that of SATA drive
firmware compatibility. We had eight 400G drives in a box that got turned into
the file server for the company. At first, we had a RocketRaid card. Some
research suggested the problems we were having were due to the drivers
and the card being substandard. So, we invested in an eight-port, 9000 series
3ware card. 
</p><p>
It turns out that 3ware has to test every firmware revision of
every SATA drive with its cards, because many perform very poorly. 
After losing three drives, we tried to replace a bad one with a 500G drive,
because we couldn't get a 400G drive at local stores, and performance
fell through the floor. I updated the firmware, researched on 3ware.com
and
called 3ware. It came down to poor quality control on the part of SATA
manufacturers, and there was nothing we could do about the drives we had. 
In summary, if you use SATA RAID, make <span   class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> you check 3ware's compatibility
list. 
</p><p>
The bad news is that you probably don't know the firmware revision
until after you open the drive and use it. Refunds get really tricky after
that, so you'll probably go through a few drives trying to find good ones.
It's probably a good idea to have multiple hot spares in your system and to
have some pretested drives lying around.

I'm writing in response to Jeremiah Bowling's article on Zenoss in the
August 2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. Although I'm sure it is a good product, there is
another one that provides the same, if not more, capability with less setup
time: Hyperic HQ. I believe <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> mentioned it in the New Products
section a while back.
</p><p>
Hyperic uses XML over HTTPS, using agents installed on hosts to provide
metrics back to the HQ Server. It can monitor 10s of 100s of different
metrics across different platforms, and it is open source. The process of
adding devices and services is performed by the agent through its detection
capabilities, which are reported back to the server automatically when the
agent is registered. SNMP isn't even needed unless desired. It is open
source, but Hyperic sells an enterprise version that comes with support.
The only thing it seems that Hyperic doesn't have that Zenoss does have is the
geographic mapping capability. Hyperic provides all the metric charts,
alerting, roles and monitoring that Zenoss does. I urge those who try out
Zenoss to take Hyperic for a spin also. I'm using it at work, and it makes
monitoring systems a breeze.
</p><p>
One final note, Jeremiah discusses the setup of SNMP and the use of
community strings. Although specifying a custom community string is better
than the default, anyone still can sniff the network to determine what the
string is, so it really doesn't provide much security. As I mentioned above,
Hyperic agents communicate with the Hyperic server using HTTPS, which we all
know really is secure.
</p><p>
I appreciate Jeremiah's article, despite my mention of a similar product. I
wasn't aware of Zenoss and always am glad to have my awareness expanded.

I was interested to see an article about building E-Ink devices in the
August 2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I acknowledge that the article involves a clever bit of engineering, but
you fail to mention that display you used, AM200, costs $3,000 US
(<a href="http://store.nexternal.com/shared/StoreFront/default.asp?CS=eink&amp;StoreType=BtoC&amp;Count1=555858790&amp;Count2=472999215" target="_self">store.nexternal.com/shared/StoreFront/default.asp?CS=eink&amp;StoreType=BtoC&amp;Count1=555858790&amp;Count2=472999215</a>).
It's disappointing this fact was left out to make the project sound more
reasonable. Normally, I've found your articles are more honest about the
costs.

Although I always enjoy reading about scientific applications for Linux,
&ldquo;One Tale of Two Scientific Distros&rdquo; by Doc Searls in your
August 2008 Upfront section,
hit particularly close to home. My cousin, David Auty, is an
astrophysicist, currently researching neutrino oscillations at Fermilab.
Here's a link to a brief description of his work: <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/profile104724.html" target="_self">www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/profile104724.html</a>.

The article &ldquo;One Box. Sixteen Trillion Bytes&rdquo; [August 2008]
showed the use of a 3ware utility
to interrogate performance of the RAID-connected SATA disks. Having some
systems with problematic hard disks, that got me wondering what general
utilities are available to support SATA disks&mdash;for example, what goes beyond
hdparm?
</p><p>
I discovered that the newer sdparm utility is designed to support SATA
disks. However, despite extensive Google searches, other than one good
overview, there is a dearth of how-to guides that highlight what one
can safely change, or the likely or possible implications of changing the
various parameters.
</p><p>
I'm sure a future article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> by an sdparm expert would be of
great interest to many since most systems are now using SATA or SAS drives
rather than PATA.
