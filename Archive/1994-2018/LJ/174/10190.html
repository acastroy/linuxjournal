<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #174, October 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Keeping <span   class="bold"><b>firmware</b></span> in the kernel is a somewhat controversial issue,
because it means keeping binary blobs of data in an open-source
project. But removing it, as <span   class="bold"><b>David
Woodhouse</b></span> is trying to do, turns
out to be controversial also. Folks like <span   class="bold"><b>David S.
Miller</b></span> are violently
opposed to the idea on the grounds that it would break certain
drivers (like tg 3) or make them much worse. Also, it takes a
part of the kernel that essentially had been approved by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>&mdash;even in binary form&mdash;and puts it in the hands of someone
else. Unlike GCC, libc and other projects on which the kernel depends,
this external firmware project would not be anything like a universal
tool; it just would be a key part of the kernel that was stored and
maintained outside the official source tree.
</p><p>
But, now that the effort actually is underway, it may be unstoppable. A
lot of folks find the problem interesting on a technical level, which
generally means they'll eventually find solutions that satisfy
everyone. For now, it seems as though firmware definitely will be
relegated to its own little spot in the kernel sources. From there,
it could end up getting a separate git tree altogether.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span> has adjusted the <span   class="bold"><b>2.4 release schedule</b></span>, based on the
results of an informal survey of existing 2.4 users. He found that
about 80% of current users didn't upgrade, because a lot of their
employees or customers would be inconvenienced by any
hiccups in the upgrade path or by the downtime required to do
the upgrade successfully. The rest of the users could upgrade easily
if they wanted to or if they knew how, but they either were running it on
their home systems and simply didn't need the benefits of 2.6, or 
they were running it on firewalls, routers and so on, and the folks
maintaining them didn't have a clearly defined upgrade path&mdash;although
Willy reckoned it wouldn't be too hard to do.
</p><p>
From all this, Willy concluded that he would put out stability fixes
more frequently, so people could get what they needed to fix whatever small
problems remained on their 2.4 systems, but that he'd slow down on
putting out major releases, and do that only for versions with new PCI
IDs, big driver updates, compiler support changes and so on. Willy
also suggested that someone write up a complete description of the
differences between 2.4 and 2.6 and how to address all the problems
of upgrading.
</p><p>
It's useful to be able to write to files under <span   class="bold"><b>CramFS</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span> and
even <span   class="bold"><b>mounted CDs</b></span>, knowing that the changes
will not be
permanent and will go away after a reboot. <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd
Bergman</b></span> has recently
implemented this kind of temporary write support for CramFS, and
<span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span> also is planning to write a similar feature for
SquashFS. A lot of folks objected to Arnd's approach though, saying
that this kind of thing should be accomplished by using <span   class="bold"><b>UnionFS</b></span> to
stack something like <span   class="bold"><b>TmpFS</b></span> on top of
CramFS. But, it turns out that
UnionFS is kind of a mess and not really able to do the job well.
Some folks, like Phillip, also feel that stackable filesystem support
should go right in the VFS, instead of clunking around in a filesystem
of its own.
</p><p>
The uproar against writing one-offs for each affected filesystem
(CramFS, SquashFS and so forth) subsided when it became clear that CramFS
and SquashFS would be the only two filesystems to do this, except for
perhaps <span   class="bold"><b>ISO9660</b></span>. At least with a small number of filesystems, the
amount of duplicated effort would not be too great. But, the people
interested in making UnionFS the canonical method of accomplishing
this sort of thing apparently have redoubled their efforts. So, it may
be that both groups will get what they need soon enough.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> asked when SquashFS would be accepted into the
kernel tree, and Phillip Lougher said that he actually was making some
major changes, after which it would presumably take some time for the
code to be reviewed by users and any remaining sizable bugs shaken
out. Among the changes, Phillip is considering changing the on-disk
data layout, which would solve certain problems but break backward
compatibility.
</p><p>
The venerable <span   class="bold"><b>AdvFS</b></span> filesystem has been
released by <span   class="bold"><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></span>
under the terms of the GPL version 2. This filesystem has been around
since the 1980s, supports journaling and file undeletion, and is very
fast in general. Nowadays, there are plenty of journaling filesystems,
but this release represents a solid and excellent body of code&mdash;and a
really terrific body of documentation&mdash;available to the Open Source
world for the first time. The AdvFS release is not, as <span   class="bold"><b>Linda Knippers</b></span>
from HP has pointed out, a port of the filesystem to Linux. HP sees
this release as providing a lot of cool stuff for open-source
developers to use in any various projects where they might be useful.
But, it's also likely that some kernel folks will want to do a real
port. So, we probably can look forward to seeing AdvFS in the main
kernel tree at some point.

Whenever I run across something new, cool and Web-based, I check Netcraft's
&ldquo;What's that site using?&rdquo; to see whether the site's servers are running on
Linux. You can't always tell, and the results can be misleading, but it's a
good first sniff test.
</p><p>
That's what I did with MoFuse (<a href="http://www.mofuse.com" target="_self">www.mofuse.com</a>), and
it passed. &ldquo;Linux
Apache/2.0.63 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.63 OpenSSL/...&rdquo;, it said.
</p><p>
What's cool about MoFuse is that it launders the layout complexities out of
blog posts and turns them into simple lists of linked headlines. It does
this free if you like, or you can pay for extra services, such as
advertising revenue sharing and URLs that don't have
&ldquo;mofuse.mobi&rdquo; in them.
</p><p>
MoFuse isn't alone, of course. Mippin (<a href="http://www.mippin.com" target="_self">www.mippin.com</a>) has been doing similar stuff for
a while, and Netcraft shows them running Linux too (Red Hat, in this case).
</p><p>
And Google, naturally, also has an interface that can turn any blog into
&ldquo;mobile.blogname.whatever&rdquo;. Of course, that's Linux too.
</p><p>
In any case, the percentage of Web surfing via mobile devices is going to
skyrocket&mdash;especially after the next generation of unlocked, uncrippled
Linux-based devices start hitting the market. Formatting for the hand
screen will shift from exception to rule.

...our goal, very simply, is to make sure the free software ecosystem can

Proprietary drivers are a horrible kludge; they're a little bit like

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Mike Warot</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #174, October 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux converts don't always come in groups. Among IT folks, they tend to
come one by one. Case in point, Mike Warot, a reader I knew for insightful
comments and fun ideas (for example, see &ldquo;It's All
Like...What?&rdquo; on page 16). Mike's experience is a good sample of what must be happening in
countless shops, even though each is different. Now, here's Mike's
description of &ldquo;what he's using&rdquo;:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I'm a one-man IT staff in what used to be a Windows shop. Today I have two
machines on my desk. The one I just let run is Ubuntu. It just runs, 24x7,
and it's there when I need it.
</p><p>
The change came once it became apparent that we were going to have to put our
Windows servers behind a firewall. I decided to use Linux to make a
firewall. I used Red Hat and EBtables to create a transparent bridge to
avoid having to re-address our servers and let everything keep its public
IP address. This was nice, because it still wasn't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>necessary</em></span> to have a
firewall, it was just an extra precaution at the time.
</p><p>
That worked well for about a year, until I got worried I wouldn't be
able to restart it. That's when a friend told me about IPcop in his work with
nonprofits. IPcop is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> easy to configure and
maintain Linux-based
firewall, which does a great job in almost all circumstances. I used IPcop
for a year or so, until problems with multiple Internet connections forced
me to seek a better solution.
</p><p>
At the same time I put in the IPcop box, I learned (eventually) two very
important facts about Windows 2000 Servers and the Internet. First, if your
domain controllers have multiple subnets from which to choose, they will get
confused and not be able to find each other (meaning users might not be
able to
log in). And second, if you followed common sense and used your real domain
name for your Windows domain name, you were FUBAR, because active directory
then puts all of your local addresses in the DNS, and you can't remove them
(or the domain stops working again).
</p><p>
This required another Linux box, for DNS services to the world. It's
running Fedora Core 5, but I'm about to replace it, because I don't know how
to update the DNS to fix the current exploit. It'll get replaced with a
VMware virtual machine running Ubuntu (more about VMware below). I now have
an Ubuntu box with iptables (or ipchains, I always forget), which
connects us to our three Internet connections.
</p><p>
With the proliferation of servers, VMware's offer of the free VMware Server was
a godsend. And, I've since learned that Linux makes a far better host than
Windows does. So, I've got some of my VMware servers running on Ubuntu, with
Windows and other things inside them. 
</p><p>
Ubuntu has made it pretty easy to set up a new machine&mdash;not that Red Hat
was very hard. But with apt-get, installation of almost any program is
trivial. I use an editor called joe to do editing when I don't have
the X Window System set up (on some of the older servers), and it's just
<tt  >sudo apt-get install joe</tt>, and I'm up and running.
</p><p>
I'm not a guru, but I've learned enough over the years to get around. Linux
offers a wider set of tools than Windows ever could. Bottom line: Linux is
amazing, and it's getting better all the time. 
</p></blockquote></div></div>
