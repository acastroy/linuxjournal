<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #256, August 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> reported on some <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span> compiler warnings that he felt were unnecessary,
and he gave his opinion on how they should work instead. Specifically, GCC 5.1
would issue a warning against using a <tt  >switch</tt> statement with a boolean
variable, presumably because a boolean would be better handled by a simple
<tt  >if</tt> statement.
</p><p>
Linus posted the following counter-example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
switch (a) {
case 1:
    A;
    if (b)
         break;
    B;
    /* fallthrough */
case 2:
    C;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
And he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You share that <tt  >C</tt> case for some conditions but not others.
</p><p>
You can do the same using <tt  >goto</tt>, of course, but you
can <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> do it with
pure nested <tt  >if ()</tt> statements.
</p><p>
So even with just two cases, <tt  >switch ()</tt> is syntactically more powerful
than <tt  >if ()</tt>, because it allows more structured exits.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Linus said that a more appropriate warning from GCC would be when the data
type of the <tt  >switch</tt> variable was different from the data type of the
<tt  >case</tt> variable. In that case, he said, a warning would make perfect sense.
But warning against using a boolean variable in a switch at all, he felt,
was going overboard. He said that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
switch (boolean) {
case true:
</pre>
</p><p>
made far more sense than following the recommendation in the GCC
documentation of casting to an integer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
switch ((int)boolean) {
switch 1:
</pre>
</p><p>
He said anyone who preferred the latter over the former &ldquo;clearly has
absolutely zero taste and is just objectively wrong&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tadeusz Struk</b></span> has proposed some patches to
implement a new <span   class="bold"><b>public key
encryption API</b></span>. The idea is to have software routines in place when no
encryption hardware is available, but to offload the work to hardware when
possible. In general though, any module could provide its own <span   class="bold"><b>RSA</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>DSA</b></span>
implementation.
</p><p>
It's not entirely a new concept&mdash;the kernel already supported public key
encryption for verifying digitally signed driver modules. But, Tadeusz's
code is intended to replace the old crypto code. Along with his patches
implementing the feature, Tadeusz submitted patches migrating older usages
to the new service.
</p><p>
There were some technical suggestions and some minor objections, but
ultimately, it does seem as though the old crypto code will be replaced by
Tadeusz's new stuff. The biggest problem seemed to be how to make it easy
for user code to handle drivers that implemented only a partial subset of
the RSA and DSA API. Initially, Tadeusz planned to allow drivers simply
to encode a list of the features they provided, but <span   class="bold"><b>Herbert Xu</b></span> convinced him
to require drivers to implement at least a complete minimal subset of
features, so users could rely on them without doing lots of tests.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Filesystem capabilities</b></span> still have not come into their own. Originally
intended as a way to loosen targeted security constraints on user processes
without going all the way to the extreme of running as root, the poor
initial design of capabilities has sometimes led to more security problems
than it solved.
</p><p>
One problem has been capability inheritance&mdash;the ability of one process to
pass along its same set of capabilities to processes it invokes. This is
the equivalent of user processes running sub-processes as that user, or
root processes running sub-processes as root&mdash;something UNIX always
has supported. But capabilities haven't implemented that feature properly, and
the available workarounds have tended to make it easier for hostile users
to gain root privileges on a system.
</p><p>
Recently <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span>, working off 
ideas by <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Lameter</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Serge Hallyn</b></span>, produced some patches that re-envisioned capability
inheritance in a way that, without breaking current usage, they claimed
would provide a saner and more secure form of inheritance.
</p><p>
Capabilities work by identifying secure abilities that are available to a
given process. A process has a certain set of capabilities, which can then
be masked off, leaving only the ones that actually will be needed by that
process. One of these masks is the &ldquo;inheritable&rdquo; mask, called
<span   class="bold"><b>pI</b></span>. The pI
mask is supposed to control which capabilities are inheritable by
sub-processes. The problem is that it doesn't do that properly, although
changing its behavior could break existing user code.
</p><p>
Andy's code got around this dilemma by introducing a new <span   class="bold"><b>pA</b></span> mask, which
he said would do what pI should have done originally. The pA mask, Andy
said, would introduce new logic and some nuanced behaviors to allow a
predictable form of inheritance that would avoid the security exploits that
had been plaguing users.
</p><p>
Several folks pointed out, and Andy acknowledged, that this wasn't a
perfect solution and left certain problems unsolved. But the bottom line,
he said, was that his code represented a real improvement and better
overall direction in a situation where no one else was able to offer any
alternatives beyond the status quo.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Rice IRC</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #256, August 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you're excited to try the ZNC IRC bouncer I highlighted in another
UpFront article this month, 
you really should test its flexibility using an
Android IRC client. I've never actually used IRC on Android, because
connecting temporarily isn't really how IRC works best. And, the thought
of staying logged in via my phone's data plan sounds unpleasant.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11887androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I tried a few IRC clients for Android, and although most are functional and
intuitive, Rice IRC stood out above the rest. It's completely free, has no
ads, and it has an interface that makes perfect sense. It also has all the
features you'd expect in a mobile chat client, including notifications,
background tasks and so on.
</p><p>
An IRC client is one of those apps where simplicity is better. IRC is
simple, and so should be the interface you use to connect with it. Rice
IRC ticks all the boxes. Get your copy today from the Google Play store:

<h2 class="title">Doing Astronomy with Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #256, August 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the things that makes Python so powerful is that you can find a module for almost
anything. In this article, I cover Astropy, which was originally
developed by the Space Telescope Science Institute for doing astronomy calculations like
image processing and observatory calculations. Because this is a Python
program, you can install it with either <tt  >pip</tt> or
<tt  >easy_install</tt>. Your Linux
distribution already should have a package included. For example, in Debian-based
distributions, you can install it with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python-astropy
</pre>
</p><p>
There is also a separate package, python-astropy-doc, that contains
extra documentation for Astropy. Because Astropy is a fairly large system,
it is broken into smaller sub-packages. This should be familiar to
anyone who has worked with packages like SciPy or NumPy before. So,
simply using the following actually isn't very useful:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import astropy
</pre>
</p><p>
You more likely will need to import
individual sub-packages with commands like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from astropy.io import fits
</pre>
</p><p>
There are sub-packages to handle file IO, cosmological calculations and
coordinate systems, among many other topics. 
Let me provide a basic
introduction to some of the available functionality so you have an idea
of what you can do.
</p><p>
First, let's look at how to deal with data files. The
common file format used in astrophysics and astronomy is the FITS file
format. The PyFITS Python package was written to read and write FITS
files. This code is actually the same as the code in the sub-package
astropy.io.fits, so you can use it in the same way. You actually
can even just drop Astropy in as a plugin with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from astropy.io import fits as pyfits
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you can use existing file management code without having to make
any changes. 
</p><p>
The first thing you need to do is open your data file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from astropy.io import fits
hdulist = fits.open("My_File.fit")
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns an object that behaves like a list. Each element of the
returned object maps to a Header-Data Unit (HDU) in the file. You can
get more information on the file with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hdulist.info()
</pre>
</p><p>
Each of the individual elements has a header and data portion. You
can access them to see details about the data you are about to
process. 
</p><p>
Along with all of the library functions, Astropy includes a
series of command-line utilities to work with FITS files. You can check
the headers of a FITS file with the <tt  >fitsheader</tt> utility. You can check
your FITS file with <tt  >fitscheck</tt>, and you even can find the differences between
two files with <tt  >fitsdiff</tt>.
</p><p>
A common computational process in astronomy is image
processing. The convolution sub-package provides two categories of
convolution operations: direct and FFT. You can do one-, two- and three-dimensional
convolutions. 
The visualization sub-package handles more basic image
processing like normalization and stretching. You can combine multiple
transformations very easily. The + operator is overloaded to apply
transformations that are &ldquo;added&rdquo; together in series. So, a
command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
transform = SqrtStretch() + PercentileInterval(90.)
</pre>
</p><p>
gives you a new function, <tt  >transform</tt>, that combines the two separate
transformations in a single step. This sub-package also includes a
script, <tt  >fits2bitmap</tt>, that can do conversions between different file
formats. 
</p><p>
A second common computational task in astronomy is doing statistics based on
observations, and Astropy provides a sub-package called stats.
Although the scipy.stats sub-package provides a
lot of functionality, some astronomy-focused functions 
are missing, so the astropy.stats sub-package fills in those missing
functions. 
</p><p>
Once you have your data loaded, you can use the modeling
sub-package. You can do 1D and 2D modeling with
<tt  >astropy.modeling</tt>. This
includes curve-fitting functionality, where you can do linear and
nonlinear function fitting. There are built-in functions to fit Gaussian
curves and polynomials. This fitting is handled with a least-squares
method. With version 1.0, you can build compound models by combining
existing models with arithmetic operators.
</p><p>
When you are ready to start doing calculations, you will need to use
constants. Instead of remembering them or using
them with potential typos, Astropy includes a complete list of all
the standard scientific constants that you will need when doing numerical
work. You can import the entire list with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from astropy import constants
</pre>
</p><p>
If you need only a few of the constants, like maybe the speed of light,
you can import them individually with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from astropy.constants import c
</pre>
</p><p>
The really cool thing about these constants is that they are actually
&ldquo;Quantity&rdquo; objects. This means you can do something like change the
units being used with a command like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
c.to('km/s')
</pre>
</p><p>
Because it is so prevalent, you can use CGS units with
<tt  >c.cgs</tt>. 
</p><p>
There
are also two sub-packages to handle coordinate systems. Astronomical
coordinate systems are handled by the coordinates sub-package, and
world coordinate systems are handled by the wcs sub-package. In
the coordinates sub-package, the core object is the
<tt  >SkyCoord</tt>
object. There are methods of this object to handle conversions between
coordinate systems or distances from one point to the origin within a
given coordinate system. The wcs sub-package allows for mapping data
within a FITS file onto a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; coordinate system in order to analyze
them correctly. This includes functionality to deal with complications,
like projections onto the sphere of the sky.
</p><p>
You even can do cosmological calculations with Astropy. The cosmology
sub-package actually includes functionality to model the evolution
of the entire cosmos based on a set of initial conditions that
you set. Although you can set your own cosmology, several
built-in cosmologies are available. These are based on the WMAP and
Planck satellite data. 
</p><p>
Most functionality is built off a core FLRW
object. This object represents a homogeneous, isotropic cosmology
defined by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric from General
Relativity. However, this class can't be used directly. You need to 
subclass it first. There are several included in the cosmology sub-package,
such as the FlatLambdaCDM object that includes dark energy. You can look
at various values, like the Hubble constant, at various points during
the evolution of the cosmology. You also can include contributions to the
energy density from matter, dark energy and even photons and neutrinos.
</p><p>
Now that you've seen a bit of what you can do with astropy, if
astronomical calculations are on your radar, there is much more
available. Additionally, there is the concept of affiliated packages. These
are packages that basically are built on top of the core functionality
provided by Astropy. Although they aren't part of Astropy, they are being
built up into a community-driven environment for doing astrophysics. It
definitely will be worth your while to take a look at the extended world of
available packages.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Flaky Connection? Mosh it!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #256, August 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most of the work I do on computers is done via the command line. When
I'm off on vacation somewhere, that means shoddy Wi-Fi and cell-phone
tethering. Because cell-phone tethering gets expensive quick (I also have
three teenage daughters with which I share a data plan), I try to use free
Internet whenever I can. The biggest hassle with that method is dealing
with broken SSH sessions. Yes, I can use programs like screen or tmux to
make sure I don't lose work, but it can be very frustrating to have
an SSH session lock up because the &ldquo;TotallySafeBro&rdquo; SSID in my hotel
goes down. And, don't get me started on lag.
</p><p>
That's where Mosh comes into play. I was lamenting in IRC, and user
&ldquo;bkidwell&rdquo; mentioned Mosh as being a great terminal client for
questionable or often-changing connections. It uses a combination
of TCP over port 22 and UDP on a higher port to provide a smooth,
flexible terminal session regardless of your connection reliability
or performance. Rather than waiting for the remote server to echo what
you type, Mosh displays your local typing and edits in real time, then
&ldquo;catches up&rdquo; with the server as quickly as it can. The coolest part,
however, is that Mosh will keep your connection alive and running even
if you change network addresses! Switching from McDonald's Wi-Fi to your
phone's shared data? No need to log out and back in.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11887fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11887fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mosh detects a disconnect and keeps trying to reconnect,
even if your IP address changes!
</p></div></div><p>
Admittedly, Mosh is lacking in some ways compared to SSH. It doesn't do
port forwarding, it doesn't keep a scrollback buffer, and its predictive
text is sometimes wrong. That last one is most noticeable on a really poor
connection, and it isn't really a problem&mdash;the screen just occasionally
changes a bit when the server/client syncs up. It's still far nicer
than typing eight lines of instructions, only to see a typo when the screen
finally updates.
</p><p>
Due to its flexibility with poor connections, cross-platform server/client
availability and convenience for mobile admins, Mosh gets this month's
Editors' Choice award. Download the application from your Linux
repository, or head over to <a href="https://mosh.mit.edu" target="_self">https://mosh.mit.edu</a> for download links
and instructions for whatever platform you might be on, including
Android. Installation is simple, and the benefits are immediate!

I often get teased for taking so much tech hardware with me on
trips&mdash;right up until the Wi-Fi at the hotel, conference center
or rented house fails. I'm currently on vacation with my family and
some of our friends from Florida, and our rental home has a faulty Wi-Fi
router. Thankfully, I have a bag <span   class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> of goodies for just this occasion. I
don't really have a set &ldquo;list&rdquo; of items I carry, but generally
I'll have the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Several Ethernet cables, various lengths.
</p></li><li><p>
A plug-in-the-outlet Wi-Fi extender.
</p></li><li><p>
A USB-powered Wi-Fi router/bridge/AP/extender.
</p></li><li><p>
Extension cables.
</p></li><li><p>
Large external battery with USB charging port.
</p></li><li><p>
Tablet (to look for Wi-Fi SSIDs, channels and signal levels).
</p></li><li><p>
RJ-45 crimper and ends (for fixing poorly crimped cables).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The USB-powered options are really due to a single incident where I had to
put a Wi-Fi repeater in the middle of a field in order to reach a remote
building. I tied the repeater and battery in a double-wrapped grocery bag
and charged the battery every couple days. It felt like the wild wild west
of networking.
</p><p>
As for our current vacation, my router is working well, and the third floor
of the house has Internet access thanks to the repeater I installed on the
second floor. At least for the duration of this trip, I don't expect to be
teased for bringing so many nerdy accoutrements.

<h2 class="title">Bounce Around IRC with ZNC</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #256, August 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my discussion on IRC with &ldquo;bkidwell&rdquo; (see the Non-Linux FOSS article
for more on our talk), we were discussing how we connect to IRC. My main
method is to SSH in to my co-located Raspberry Pi in Austria and connect
to a screen session I have running that is constantly connected to IRC
with Irssi. This works really well for me, and I never miss messages
when I'm away. The big problem I have is occasionally I'm away from
a laptop, and so I can't efficiently use the terminal to chat. It might
be technically possible to IRC chat via an SSH app on my phone, but it
would mean super-tiny text and awkward keyboard shortcuts.
</p><p>
That's where ZNC comes into play. I've never used an IRC bouncer before,
but the concept is that it stays connected to IRC using your credentials,
and it allows you to connect to it with your IRC app and pick up where
you left off. Functionally, it's like a screen session, but instead of
connecting via SSH, you connect with an IRC client. Since it keeps you
logged in, when you connect, you have access to the chats and personal
queries that have occurred while you were disconnected. Plus, it allows
you to connect from multiple locations at once and use whatever IRC
client you want&mdash;there's no &ldquo;client&rdquo; application you have to use!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11887zncf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://znc.in" target="_self">znc.in</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
ZNC is really an awesome way to use IRC. It allows me to keep using
Irssi too, because I just point Irssi at the ZNC bouncer, and never
miss a beat even when I'm remote on my phone. If you use IRC regularly
or are hesitant because of the issues I've highlighted here, I urge
you to check out ZNC. It's at <a href="http://znc.in" target="_self">znc.in</a> and is available
for most platforms.
