This article is the third part of a four-part series that examines some
of the changes in 3D printing that have occurred in the past three
years since my first articles on the subject. Because this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>,
instead of discussing the entire 3D printing world, I'm focusing on the
sections of the topic most relevant to open source and open hardware. In
the first article, I gave a general overview on the current state of 3D
printing. In the second, I
covered what's changed in 3D printing hardware during the past three years,
including the shift away from open hardware and which printers still hold
onto their open hardware roots. In this article,
I discuss the changes in 3D printing software, and then in the
final piece, I'll walk through setting up OctoPrint on
a Raspberry Pi to control your printer remotely.
</p><p>
The software side of 3D printing three years ago was a model example
of the power of open-source software. Just about any popular hobbyist
printer you could choose used open-source software, all the way from the
firmware (often Marlin) on the Arduino-based boards, to the software
that sent Gcode to the printers (the Printrun suite of tools), to the
slicers that took 3D models and converted them into the Gcode the printer
understood (Slic3r and Repetier among others), to the software you could
use to create the 3D models to begin with (OpenSCAD, FreeCAD and Blender,
among others). All of this software ran on Linux, so you could work with
every part of the 3D printing life cycle without proprietary software. As
interest in 3D printing grew, the open nature of all the software helped
drive a lot of the innovation we see today.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, if not predictably, as 3D printing grew in popularity
and new companies entered the market driven more by profit than by the
health of the community, we saw the software side of 3D printing close
up and become proprietary, just as we saw with the hardware side. In many
cases, a company would enter the market with a proprietary 3D printer but
still rely on open-source software to drive it to buy time to write up
a proprietary alternative. Just like we saw Makerbot start to close up
its hardware designs, we saw once open-source software like Repetier
(previously
under an Apache license) switch to be closed source. A number of companies
that produce commercial CAD software, such as AutoCAD, also have entered the
consumer market with proprietary host- and cloud-based CAD software, along
with software to slice 3D models and control the 3D printers themselves.
</p><p>
All this talk of proprietary software might make the software side of
3D printing seem rather bleak, but among all those clouds is some silver
lining. While Printrun and Slic3r still are running strong, Ultimaker, the
creator of the open hardware Ultimaker line of 3D printers, has released
its own slicing and printer control software called Cura that has become
the popular choice among many in the 3D printing community. Cura combines
the 3D printer control features of Printrun (with a similar control panel,
in fact) with a fast slicer and a sophisticated interface that makes it
easy to view, rotate and scale 3D models before you print. Ultimaker
even provides packages for a number of common Linux distributions so
you don't have to bother building the software if you don't want to.
</p><p>
Although Cura was created for the Ultimaker printers, at startup, it launches
a wizard that contains calibration settings for a number of popular 3D
printers, including the full Printrbot line among others. In fact, Cura
is now the recommended slicing and control software for Printrbot
printers. Once the startup wizard completes, Cura knows the basic
settings about your printer, such as the default size of the hot end,
what size filament it takes and the overall size of the print bed. That
doesn't mean you may not have to do some tweaking, however. In my case, I
needed to modify the Gcode Cura used at the beginning and end of a print
based on Printrbot's recommendations to make sure that the auto-leveler
functioned appropriately and that the extruder counter reset properly.
</p><p>
The default Cura interface is relatively straightforward (Figure 1), and
if you click Expert&rarr;Switch to quickprint, it provides a simplistic
view that hides a lot of the more advanced settings you may want to
tweak. In fact, it even hides the more advanced printer control interface
in favor of something simpler. When printing an object in this simplistic
mode, you just select among a few different quality settings that set
reasonable defaults for speed and layer height. The main window gives
you a clear view of any 3D objects you have loaded and allows you to
use your mouse to rotate and move the option around as well as scale
it up and down, much like with CAD software. One nice feature of Cura is
that it not only slices very quickly, it also starts slicing the moment any
setting changes instead of waiting for you to tell it to do it, so once you are
ready to print the object, Cura likely already has generated the
Gcode.

</p></div></div><p>
Those basic printing presets are geared toward Ultimaker printers,
so if you use a different printer, you probably will want to switch
over to the advanced settings view by clicking Expert&rarr;Switch to full
settings (Figure 2). In the advanced view, you can tweak just about
any slicing setting you need once you settle on a configuration that
works for your printer, and if that isn't enough, you can go into the
expert settings window and tweak even more. When you get things exactly
how you like them, you can save various profiles. This is particularly
useful for some of the more exotic materials, such as Ninjaflex. I like
to have a basic default profile for the normal PLA I use with average
quality prints, and I've created custom profiles for Ninjaflex and for
PLA with higher quality settings.

The CAD world from the open-source perspective is one area that is
still relatively similar to what it was three years ago. Tools like OpenSCAD and
Blender still dominate, and OpenSCAD has seen variants like OpenJSCad
that uses JavaScript as the language to build 3D objects. Most of the
growth in CAD software appears to be on the free-in-cost-but-proprietary
front from companies like AutoCAD that aim to provide a simple set of
CAD features in a desktop or Web tool as an introduction to its more
sophisticated suite of CAD software for sale down the line. Apart from
the obvious downsides this presents to open-source advocates, it also
means that although the .stl files these tools generate can be opened and
printed by everyone, the source project files (which make modifying a
model much easier, like a GIMP project file instead of a .png) require
that proprietary software to open.
</p><p>
Three years ago, the primary site you would use to share and download
3D printed objects was Thingiverse. Although Thingiverse is still a
popular choice, there was some community backlash a few years ago
due to some changes to its Terms of Use that gave it more rights
over user-submitted prints than some in the community were comfortable
with. This prompted a backlash, and protesters uploaded protest statement
objects to the site. One result of this controversy was that a number of
other sites sprang up to share 3D models. The most notable one for the
Open Source community is probably YouMagine, which is run by Ultimaker
and is a popular choice by those in the Open Source community for
sharing models.
</p><p>
The final interesting advance in open-source 3D printing software is a
big enough topic that my final article in this series will be devoted just
to it: OctoPrint. With the OctoPrint project, you can turn a Raspberry Pi
(or really any Linux computer) into a standalone Web-based controller
for your 3D printer. OctoPrint supports Webcams and the Raspberry Pi
camera specifically, so you can watch the progress of your print from
another room or another location entirely and take time-lapse videos
of your prints. Even though I use Cura as my slicing software, and
Cura easily could control my printer as well, I still use OctoPrint to
manage my print jobs so I get the benefit of the video and the remote
control. It's handy to start a print in my office and then be able to
monitor it from the living room. If this sounds interesting to you,
be sure to check next month's issue where I will describe how to set up
and use OctoPrint in detail.
