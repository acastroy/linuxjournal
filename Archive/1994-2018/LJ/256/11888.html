Objects are great, but your database is the best place to do serious
manipulations on your data.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ac3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I love high-level, dynamically typed languages, such as Python, Ruby
and JavaScript. They're easy&mdash;and even fun&mdash;to use. They let me
express myself richly, and they lend themselves to code that 
easily can be reused and maintained. It's no surprise that interest in
such languages is on the rise, especially when creating Web
applications.
</p><p>
Now, one of the downsides of these languages is that they tend to execute
more slowly than static languages, such as Java, C# and Go. But for a
very large number of Web applications, this speed difference doesn't
matter, or it is justified by the productivity gain enjoyed by the
engineers, or it can be (somewhat) handled by throwing hardware at the
problem.
</p><p>
However, the fact that dynamic languages run more slowly than their
static counterparts doesn't mean you want to ignore the
speed issue completely. Once you know your way around dynamic languages, as well
the frameworks built in them, you get a sense of what runs quickly
and what doesn't.
</p><p>
In just the past few weeks, however, I've encountered a pattern&mdash;or
perhaps I should say, an &ldquo;anti-pattern&rdquo;&mdash;in the code that several of
my consulting clients had written. This anti-pattern is well known to
experienced developers, but it seems to be less well known than I would
have hoped or expected. That anti-pattern, stated simply, is that you
should have the database do as much work as possible.
</p><p>
There are several reasons for throwing as much as possible at your
database server. First and foremost, your database almost certainly
is written in C, so it's likely to execute more quickly than your
high-level, dynamic code.
</p><p>
Second, your database has been highly optimized through the years, such
that retrieving data from it has been tuned to take into account
memory, disk and the frequency of the retrievals.
</p><p>
Third, although network bandwidth is cheap nowadays, it's not
infinitely fast. This means that although you could, in theory, write a
database query in Ruby that returns a large number of rows and then
filters through them using Enumerate#map, if you have the
database do some of this for you, it can reduce the
amount of data you're retrieving dramatically and, thus, lead to faster application
responses and less network usage.
</p><p>
So in this article, I explore this anti-pattern of doing work in an
application that probably should be done in the database. You'll see how
you can get the same results, but much faster, by applying this rule.
There's obviously no one right way to do things, but having the
database do as much work as possible is likely to make your
applications faster and easier to maintain.

Don't Load Everything</h2></div></div><p>
High-level languages, and most high-level Web frameworks, don't
encourage you to write SQL directly. Rather, you use objects and
methods to work with the database; the methods you invoke are
translated into SQL by an ORM (object-relational mapper). Part of the
reason, I believe, for the widespread inefficiencies in people's
database queries is that they don't see the SQL they're writing,
so they don't understand some of the implications of their method
calls.
</p><p>
For example, say I'm working on a project in Django. 
If I have a model named Person, I can (and should) invoke the
&ldquo;objects&rdquo; method in order to work with the corresponding table in the
database. I then can take the resulting object and apply additional
filters, getting (for example) the records corresponding to people who
are system administrators:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; admins = Person.objects.filter(admin=True).all()
</pre>
</p><p>
Once I've done that, &ldquo;admins&rdquo; will contain a set of records, known in
the Django world as a &ldquo;QuerySet&rdquo;. But in actuality, a QuerySet
doesn't contain the records themselves. Rather, it serves as a
go between to the database. If you iterate over the QuerySet, you'll get
each of the records, one by one.
</p><p>
Thus, even if you'll eventually get one million records back from the
database, the above code doesn't retrieve them. You can get the
records, one by one, by iterating over the result set. For example,
the following will display the user names for all of the
administrators:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for admin in admins:
        print(admin.username)
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the right way to work with objects in Django. Although it might
seem weird not to have the entire result set in memory, the
implications are tremendous. You don't need to worry about using up all
of the server's memory if the resulting records will be too large.
</p><p>
Working with iterators is easy and straightforward, if you're used to
it. If you're not, it might seem strange not to have the entire
result set at once, and to iterate over it. Moreover, all you need is
the right combination of a result set and the following code:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; admins = list(Person.objects.filter(admin=True).all())
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice what I've changed in the above assignment? I'm no longer asking
for the QuerySet, over which I can iterate. Rather, I've asked for the
QuerySet's data to be used to create a list and then assigned to
&ldquo;admins&rdquo;. If you have one million records in your result set, this is
going to consume a fairly large amount of memory.
</p><p>
It's true that this can be necessary, at times, but those times are
fairly rare. After all, the odds are pretty good that you're
retrieving the records in order to display them to users, something
that is easily and efficiently accomplished with iteration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24acf08"></a>
Filtering</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say I'm interested in displaying all of the administrators
on my system. Above, I showed that you can do that with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; admins = Person.objects.filter(admin=True).all()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for admin in admins:
        print(admin.username)
</pre>
</p><p>
However, there's a variation of this that I've often seen people do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; people = Person.objects.all()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for person in people:
        if person.admin:
            print(person.username)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice what I'm doing here: I'm retrieving all of the objects and
then iterating over them. Then, I use an &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement in Python to
determine whether I want to print the user name. If you're used to
working with Python objects, this seems like a perfectly natural
thing to do.
</p><p>
However, let's consider what's actually happening here. You're
retrieving all of the records and using only a small number of
them. This means the database is being forced to read through all
of its records, bring all of them into memory and send those records
to the Python application&mdash;even though the odds are that only a
small proportion of these records will be printed.
</p><p>
Moreover, while the &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement in Python definitely is quite
efficient, there is still some overhead to the lookup of the
<tt  >person.admin</tt> attribute, not to mention the creation
of a new &ldquo;Person&rdquo;
object for each record you got back from the database. In other words,
you're creating a huge number of Person objects just to display some
output.
</p><p>
It's far, far more efficient to do your filtering in the database and
create Python objects only for the records that you're most likely to
want to display. The database, if defined correctly, has indexes that
it can use to speed up the query if you tell it to filter records
such that it consumes less memory, less CPU and less network
bandwidth.
</p><p>
I've seen a variation on this anti-pattern in that people sometimes
want to perform transformations on data that they have retrieved from
the database. For example, let's assume that I want to apply a sales tax
of 10% on all of the prices in a set of records. I certainly
could say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; products = Product.objects.all()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for product in products:
        print(product.price * 1.10)
</pre>
</p><p>
But it'll be faster and require less Python code, if I simply say:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; products = Product.objects.raw('select id, price * 1.10 as
&gt;&gt;&gt; price_with_tax from store_product))
&gt;&gt;&gt; for product in products:
        print(product.price_with_tax)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the use of <tt  >raw</tt> allows you to go behind the back of
Django's ORM, using whatever SQL you want. Is this the way you
always want to do things? Surely not. But in specific cases, or when
you want to use a function, it definitely can come in handy. Note that
the object you get back from the call to <tt  >raw()</tt> is a
<tt  >RawQuerySet</tt>, which
is an iterator just like the regular <tt  >QuerySet</tt>.
However, it lacks an <tt  >all()</tt>
method, which is just as well, given that the
<tt  >RawQuerySet</tt> is already an
iterator, giving the appropriate records when requested (and not
before).
</p><p>
Note that for commonly used SQL functions, such as
<tt  >COUNT</tt>, there are
built-in Django methods that handle such things. So if you're
counting, sorting or grouping, you shouldn't need to step down to the
SQL level. And as a general rule, you don't want to do that.
However, there are times when it comes in handy&mdash;particularly if
you're trying to reduce the amount of data you'll have to handle in
Python.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b4580.0x24ad958"></a>
Loops and Joins</h2></div></div><p>
The final anti-pattern is something I just saw at a client's
office several days before writing this. The company has a large number of
products and wants to perform a query for each of the products. So, they
did something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; products = Product.objects.all()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for product in products:
        ProductInfo.objects.filter(product_id=product.id).all()
</pre>
</p><p>
This query took a very long time to run. Why? Because for each of the
thousands of products, they were then issuing an additional SQL
query. The funny thing was that each individual query executed
quickly, so it didn't show up in our PostgreSQL slow-query logging
monitor. But the effect of executing such a query was dramatic and
ended up taking many minutes.
</p><p>
The solution was to turn our many queries into a single query. In
SQL, we would use an inner join. And indeed, when I used an inner join
in raw SQL, we found that instead of taking several minutes to
execute, it took 1.5 seconds&mdash;obviously, a huge time savings.
</p><p>
There are two possible solutions in Django for this problem. The first
is to use a raw SQL query, as I showed above. That's not an ideal
solution, particularly since the whole idea of an ORM is to remove the
use of SQL and stay within a single language (Python, in this
case). But there are times when you cannot avoid it.
</p><p>
However, if you want to be smarter about it, you can use Django's
<tt  >selected_related</tt> method. This allows you to retrieve not just one
model, but a related model&mdash;in effect, creating a join in your
database and producing one large query instead of many small ones.
The effect on the performance of your application may well be dramatic
in such a case, as I discovered when working with my client.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Object-relational mappers are wonderful things. However, at the end of
the day, sometimes they can fool you into forgetting that there is a
cost (in time and space) to bringing your data from the database into
your language. Most modern frameworks try to help by using
lazy-loading and iterators, such that you retrieve individual records
and not the entire data set. However, it's all too easy to retrieve
everything at once, or make your application work too hard, or even
to invoke too many queries on your database.
