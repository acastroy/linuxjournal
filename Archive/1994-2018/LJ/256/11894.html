Why are hash tables so important?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a05580.0x2afd250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first time I heard about hash tables was after taking a compilers course
during my BSc. The truth is, I was not able to understand and
appreciate their usefulness fully back then. Now that I know more about hash
tables, I decided to write about them so others will see their importance as
well.
</p><p>
Hash tables can be implemented in any programming language, including Awk.
However, the
choice of programming language is not the most important thing compared
to other critical choices. Hash tables are used in compilers, databases,
caching, associative arrays and so on. Hash tables are one of the most important data
structures in computer science.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a05580.0x2afd460"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
The problem that will serve as an example for this
article is finding out how many words from one text file appear in another text file.
All programs in this article use a text file (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pride and
Prejudice</em></span>) for
populating the hash table. Another text file (<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer</em></span>)
will be used for testing the performance of the hash table. You can download
both text files
from Project Gutenberg. 
</p><p>
The following output shows how
many words each file contains:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wc AofTS.txt
    9206   73845  421884 AofTS.txt
$ wc PandP.txt
   13426  124589  717573 PandP.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, both text files are relatively large, which is good for
benchmarking. Your real-life hash tables may not be as big.
In order to remove various control characters, as well as punctuation marks
and numbers, both text files were processed further:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ strings PandP.txt &gt; temp.INPUT
$ awk '{for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++) print $i}' temp.INPUT &gt; new.INPUT
$ cat new.INPUT |  tr -cd '![a-zA-Z]\n' &gt; INPUT
$ strings AofTS.txt &gt; temp.CHECK
$ awk '{for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++) print $i}' temp.CHECK &gt; new.CHECK
$ cat new.CHECK |  tr -cd '![a-zA-Z]\n' &gt; empty.CHECK
$ sed '/!/d' empty.CHECK &gt; temp.CHECK
$ sed '/^\s*$/d' temp.CHECK &gt; CHECK

</pre>
</p><p>
The reason for simplifying both files is that some control characters made
the C programs crash. As the purpose of this article is to showcase hash
tables, I decided to simplify the input instead of spending time trying to
figure out the problem
and modifying the C code.
</p><p>
After constructing the hash table using the first file (INPUT) as input, the
second one (CHECK) will be used for testing the hash table. This will be the
actual use of the hash table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a05580.0x2afd880"></a>
Theory</h2></div></div><p>
Let me start with the definition of a hash table. A hash table is a
data structure that stores one or more key and value pairs. A hash table can
store keys of any type.
</p><p>
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of
buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be found. Ideally, the
hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket. Unfortunately, this
rarely happens. In practice, more than one of the keys will hash to the same
bucket.
The most important characteristic of a hash table is the number of buckets.
The number of buckets is used by the hashing function. The second most
important characteristic is the hash function used. The most crucial feature
of the hash function is that it should produce a uniform distribution of the
hash values.
</p><p>
You can say that the search time is now O(n/k), where n is the number of keys, and k is the size of the hash array. Although the improvement looks small, you
should realize that for a hash array with 20 buckets, the search time is now
20 times smaller.
</p><p>
It is important for the hash function to behave consistently and output the
same hash value for identical keys. A collision happens when two keys are
hashing to the same index&mdash;that's not an unusual situation. There are many
ways to deal with a collision.
</p><p>
A good solution is to use separate chaining. The hash table is an array of
pointers, each one pointing to the next key with the same hash value. When a
collision occurs, the key will be inserted in constant time to the head of a
linked list. The problem now is that when you have to search a hash value for
a given key, you will have to search the whole linked list for this key. In
the worst case, you might need to traverse the entire linked
list&mdash;that's
the main reason the linked list should be moderately small, giving the
requirement for a large number of buckets.
</p><p>
As you can imagine, resolving collisions involves some kind of linear
search; therefore, you need a hash function that minimizes collisions as much
as possible. Other techniques for resolving collisions include open
addressing, Robin Hood hashing and 2-choice hashing.
</p><p>
Hash tables are good at the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
In a hash table with the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; number of buckets, the
average cost for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored
in the table.
</p></li><li><p>
Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries
can be predicted in advance so that the bucket array can be allocated once
with the optimum size and never resized.
</p></li><li><p>
If the set of key-value pairs is fixed and known ahead of time (so insertions
and deletions are not allowed), you can reduce the average
lookup cost by a careful choice of the hash function, bucket table size and
internal data structures.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Hash tables also have some disadvantages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
They are not good at keeping sorted data. It is not efficient to use a hash
table if you want your data sorted.
</p></li><li><p>
Hash tables are not effective when the number of entries is very small,
because despite the fact that operations on a hash table take constant time
on average, the cost of a good hash function can be significantly higher than
the inner loop of the lookup algorithm for a sequential list or search tree.
</p></li><li><p>
For certain string processing applications, such as spell-checking, hash
tables may be less efficient than trees or finite automata.
</p></li><li><p>
Although the average cost per operation is constant and fairly small, the
cost of a single operation may be fairly high. In particular, if the hash
table uses dynamic resizing, inserting or deleting a key may, once in a
while,
take time proportional to the number of entries. This can be a serious
drawback in applications where you want to get results fast.
</p></li><li><p>
Hash tables become quite inefficient when there are many collisions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As I'm sure you understand, not every problem can be solved equally well with the
help of a hash table. You always should consider and examine all your options
before deciding what to use.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a simple hash table with keys and values shown. The hash
function is the modulo 10 function; therefore, ten buckets are needed because
only ten results can come from a modulo 10 calculation. Having only ten
buckets is not considered very good, especially if the number of values grows
large, but it is fine for illustrative purposes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11894f1.large.jpg"><img src="11894f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Simple Hash Table
</p></div></div><p>
To summarize, a hash table should follow these principles:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Do not have too many buckets, just as many as needed.
</p></li><li><p>
It is good for the hash function to take into account as much information
provided by the key as possible. This is not a trivial task.
</p></li><li><p>
The hash function must be able to hash similar keys to different hash
values.
</p></li><li><p>
Each bucket should have the same number of keys or at least as close to
being equal as possible (this is a very desirable property).
</p></li><li><p>
Following some principles will make collisions less likely.
First, you should use a prime number of buckets. Second, the
bigger the size of the array, the smaller the probability of collisions.
Finally, you should make sure that the hash function is smart enough to
distribute its return values as evenly as possible.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a05580.0x2afe9b0"></a>
Delete, Insert and Lookup</h2></div></div><p>
The main operations on a hash table are insertion, deletion and lookup. You
use the hash value to determine where in the hash table to store a key.
Later, you use the same hash function to determine where in the hash table to
search for a given key.
</p><p>
Once the hash table is populated, searching is the same as doing an
insertion. You hash the data you are searching for, go to that place in the
array, look down the list that starts from that location, and see if what you
are looking for is in the list. The number of steps is O(1). The worst-case
search time for a hash table is O(n), which can happen when all keys are
stored in the same bucket. Nevertheless, the probability of that happening is
so small that both the best and average cases are considered to be O(1).
</p><p>
You can find many hash table implementations on the Internet or in
several books on the topic. The tricky part is using the right number of buckets and
choosing an efficient hash function that will distribute values as uniformly
as possible. A distribution that is not uniform definitely will increase the
number of collisions and the cost of resolving them.

A C Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
The first implementation will be stored in a file named ht1.c. The
implementation uses separate chaining, because separate chaining is a
reasonable choice. For simplicity, both input and output filenames are
hard-coded inside the program. After finishing with the input and building the
hash table, the program starts reading the second file, word by word, and
starts checking whether a word can be found in the hash table.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows
the full C code of the ht1.c file.

An Even Better C Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
The second implementation will be stored in a file named ht2.c. This
implementation uses separate chaining as well.
Most of the C code is the same as in ht1.c except for the hash function. The
C code for the modified hash function is the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int hash(char *str, int tablesize)
{
    int sum = 0;

    // Is it a valid string?
        if(str == NULL)
    {
        return -1;
    }

        // Calculate the sum of all characters in the string
        for( ; *str; str++)
    {
        sum += *str;
    }

        // Return the sum mod the table size
        return (sum % tablesize);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
What this hash function does better than the other one is that it takes into
account all the letters of the string instead of just the first one.
Therefore, the produced number, which corresponds to the position of the key
in the hash table, is bigger, and this results in being able to take advantage of
hash tables with a larger number of buckets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a05580.0x2af59d0"></a>
Benchmarks</h2></div></div><p>
The presented benchmarks are far from accurate or scientific. They are just
an indication of what is better, what works and what doesn't and so on.
Keep in mind that finding the optimal hash table size is not always
easy.
</p><p>
All programs were compiled as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcc -Wall program.c -o program
</pre>
</p><p>
The trusty <tt  >time</tt> command produced the following output after executing ht1
with four different hash table sizes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep define ht1.c
#define TABLESIZE 101

</p><p>
Figure 2 shows a plot of the execution times from the four different values
of the TABLESIZE variable of the ht1.c program. The bad thing about ht1.c is
that its performance with a hash table of 101 buckets is almost the same as
with one with 1,001 buckets!

</p><p>
Figure 3 shows a plot of the execution times from the five different values
of the TABLESIZE variable used in the ht2.c program. All hash table sizes are
prime numbers. The reason for using prime numbers is that they behave better
with the modulo operation. This is because a prime number has no
positive divisors other than one and itself. As a result, the product of a prime
number with another integer has fewer positive divisors than the product of a
non-prime number with another integer.

TABLESIZE Variable Used in the ht2.c Program 
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the new hash function performs much better than the hash
function found in ht1.c. As a result, the use of more buckets greatly
improves the performance of the hash table. Nevertheless, as long as the
words in the text files are finite, there is no point in using more buckets
than the number of unique words in the input file.
</p><p>
It is useful to examine the distribution of keys in the hash table for the
ht2 implementation using two different number of buckets. The following C
function prints the number of keys in each bucket:


<pre     class="programlisting">

void printHashTable(node *table[], const unsigned int tablesize)
{
    node *e;
    int i;
    int length = tablesize;
    printf("Printing a hash table with %d buckets.\n", length);

    for(i = 0; i&lt;length; i++)
    {
        // printf("Bucket: %d\n", i);
        // Get the first node of the linked list
        // for the given bucket.
        e = table[i];

        int n = 0;
        if (e == NULL)
        {
            // printf("Null bucket %d\n", i);
        }
        else
        {
            while( e != NULL )
            {
                n++;
                e = e-&gt;next;
            }
        }
        printf("Bucket %d has %d keys\n", i, n);
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Figure 4 shows the number of keys in each bucket for two hash tables: one
with 97 buckets and the other with 997 buckets. The hash table with 997
buckets appears to follow a pattern on how it fills its buckets, whereas the
hash table with the 97 buckets is more evenly distributed. Nevertheless, the
bigger hash table has a lower number of keys in each bucket which is what you
really want because less keys in each linked list means less time searching
it.
