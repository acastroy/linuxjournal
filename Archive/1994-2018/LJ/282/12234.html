What Is Subutai?</h2></div></div><p>
Subutai is an open-source project and platform that lets anyone share,
barter or rent computer resources to create clouds from the edge rather
than centralized locations (<a href="https://subutai.io" target="_self">https://subutai.io</a>). Available devices can
attach to these clouds hovering on the edge. We started calling it Social
Cloud Computing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cloud_computing" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cloud_computing</a>),
but technically, Subutai is a dynamic p2p multi-cloud made possible thanks
to Lightweight Linux Containers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC</a>)
and software-defined networking. Think Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud
(<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc" target="_self">https://aws.amazon.com/vpc</a>), but running on your computers and the
computers of social contacts who share their computer resources with
you. Or, think AirBnB on computers for the people's cloud.
</p><p>
Subutai partners with the Digital Life Collective, a member co-operative
that researches, develops, funds and supports what we call &ldquo;tech we
trust&rdquo;&mdash;those technologies that put the individual's autonomy,
privacy and dignity first, or that support those technologies that
do. Our tech, not their tech.
</p><p>
We work together so Subutai can help prevent our privacy from being
compromised and our every action from being analyzed. That means not
being tied to large cloud providers and giving us the option to use
resources we have on hand.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc2f880"></a>
How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>
You set how much of your computers' resources you're willing to share
with others. Rules and quotas are used to share with contacts from
your social-media accounts. Once your network of friends, family and
colleagues share with you, the stage is set to create clouds across
shared computer resources.
</p><p>
When someone creates a cloud, peer computers authorized to share
resources with the cloud's owner swarm together (like bees) to form
an n-way virtual private network (VPN). A peer is a group of computers
with resources that can be shared with others. A peer can be a rack of
computers or a single virtual machine running on your laptop.
</p><p>
Peers contribute resources into the VPN as Linux container hosts. Whatever
the underlying hardware, operating system or virtualization technology,
resources are presented canonically to environments as containers. The VPN
provides secure connectivity between these containers across the internet.
</p><p>
Template containers can be fired up based on Docker images to install
infrastructure rapidly. Subutai has a blueprint feature for standing up
complicated application stacks over several containers. It's a simple JSON-based templating format similar to Amazon's Cloud Formation templates. Use
blueprints to fire up application stacks within environments, and/or build
environments using your favorite devops tools for automation. Subutai
blueprints support Ansible and other tools out of the box.
</p><p>
You basically have your own virtual data center ready to go and how you
build it out is up to you. The best thing is, it's free, open source,
and your mileage depends on who you know and your social-media network,
not your wallet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc2fb40"></a>
What's with the Name, Dude?</h2></div></div><p>
We think Subutai is totally bad-assed mind-explosion-inducing madness:
that's why we named it after one of the greatest bad asses of all time,
General Subutai (aka The Dog of War). The Apache people working on
the project really like the meritocratic approach Subutai used where
doers rule regardless of their background. Plus, Jon 'maddog' Hall,
the project's principal advisor, and CEO of the company that originally
authored Subutai, thought the name was befitting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc2fc48"></a>
What's the State of the Project?</h2></div></div><p>
Subutai is ready and mature. We've been coding up a storm using every
advantage we can gain from the latest emerging technologies to make
the jaw-dropping magic happen. We are shocked and get goose bumps every
time we see Subutai working (like when a jet flies over real low); we
fire up our own clouds across the world on our machines because we just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>. It's sick!
</p><p>
Now it's time for us to share its magic with everyone else, especially
with our recent 5.0 major release. We're proud to have produced a major
Subutai release almost every year for the past five years. But, we never
bothered pushing hard to have others use it. Now it's time to go to
the next level.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc2fe58"></a>
Why Did You Create Subutai?</h2></div></div><p>
People are increasingly conscious of compromising their privacy and
getting locked in to large cloud providers, while the cost of cloud
compute services can become overwhelming for the little guy. Created to
address this problem, Subutai allows people to create their own resilient
clouds running across computing resources they already own.
</p><p>
Most painful of all, when using AWS or other cloud providers, we kept
getting unpleasant end-of-month surprises after forgetting to turn
instances off. We wanted something simple, zero cost and independent
of the cloud providers for testing and to satisfy our basic OS project
infrastructure needs. We did not need premium resources. We just needed
a bit more redundancy than running on a single home computer over a
residential broadband line.
</p><p>
Beyond sharing and bartering, Subutai allows individuals and commercial
entities, big or small, to rent resources in a cloud services sharing
economy. By democratizing the cloud, the &ldquo;race to zero&rdquo; rapidly
accelerates to reduce costs and increase hosting options closer to (or on)
the edge. This has the additional advantage of increasing performance
and efficiency by locating services and applications closer to where
those services and applications are used most.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc30068"></a>
What Now?</h2></div></div><p>
We want to benefit the Open Source community, basically folks like
us. In preparation to take on hordes of new participants, we created an
open-source rewards program for FOSS projects. Any peer owner can donate
computer resources to open-source projects for &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo;. The system
runs purely on goodwill, and participants create it by being good actors:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Registering and inviting friends to register.
</p></li><li><p>
Setting up peers and keeping them running above some uptime.
</p></li><li><p>
Upgrading quickly when new releases come out.
</p></li><li><p>
Notifying tenants of outages in advance (giving tenants time to self-evacuate).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is the slow path to accumulating goodwill. A quicker approach is
to trade peer resources for goodwill or create goodwill by donating
peer resources to FOSS projects. We added GitHub integrations that
allow GitHub projects to register with the Subutai Hub. These projects
create Subutai organizations that map to their GitHub organizations and
specify the resources they need. The Subutai Hub advertises their needs
to peer owners that can then contribute peer resources to their favorite
GitHub open-source projects. Peer owners create and earn goodwill while
being recognized for their contributions to their favorite projects. If
applicable, FOSS projects contribute blueprints that cloud owners can
use to install the project's products. More information about the program
is available on our Subutai FOSS Contribution Program page: <a href="https://subutai.io/helping-the-good-guys.html" target="_self">https://subutai.io/helping-the-good-guys.html</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc30590"></a>
What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
There's a lot more to Subutai than just software. We've designed a
broadband modem that is also a turnkey Subutai Appliance and can
be used for IoT applications. We call it the Liquid Router because
we made it the Swiss army knife of IoT gateways: it has Raspberry Pi,
Arduino and PMod headers. Yeah, we're f'ing crazy, but the cloud router/IoT gateway will soon do something no other broadband router can do:
it will effortlessly allow average broadband users to mine for Subutai's
cryptocurrency while sharing, bartering or renting computer resources.
Hence, it's obviously also a physical cryptocurrency wallet.
</p><p>
Yes indeed, we just did what you think we did! We dropped the
cryptocurrency bomb right here on <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. That brings us to our cryptocurrency
aspirations. We're trying to go beyond sharing and bartering to enable
renting with Subutai's cryptocurrency token. The system always
will operate on goodwill, but eventually will allow direct Subutai coin
transactions.
</p><p>
Besides turning cloud computing on the edge into a real sharing economy,
we're really excited about the several problems we will solve with
blockchain technology. Blockchain smart contracts can be used for service-level agreements and to enforce accountability. We want verified small
businesses to leverage Subutai to buy and sell resources to one another
using Subutai's cryptocurrency and the blockchain. Before AWS, Amazon was
just an e-commerce company. Why can't any verified company sell cloud
services regardless of its vertical? We want to start a supernova to
birth millions of Amazons that can transact with each other to provide
amazing cloud services and applications on and off the edge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb37580.0xc307f8"></a>
How Can Others Get Involved?</h2></div></div><p>
First and foremost, we need users to create peers and environments,
then give us feedback: our GitHub issue-trackers are ready. Our
intelligent launchers will help you set up a VM on your desktop to share
or rent resources. Power users can use scripts with other hypervisors
and environments. We need projects on GitHub to register for the OS
contribution program and provide blueprints for applications to be made
available to all users in the Subutai Bazaar.
</p><p>
Next, we need developers! We need Ethereum blockchain and Solidity-savvy
engineers, P2P researchers to help us experiment and optimize DHT and
Gossip protocols. We need C/C++, Java, JavaScript and Golang programmers. If
you want to get involved as a developer, first give Subutai a try as
a user. Then take a look at our list of GitHub projects in the Resources section
of this article. Come
onto our Slack channel and let us know if you need help diving in.
We're here and waiting for you!
</p><p>
Register on the Subutai Hub this month using the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> code
LJOCT17, and we'll give you some goodwill to trade cloud resources with
others on the system. Happy sharing!
