Why stress over losing that expensive personal or work laptop? Buy a cheap
one for risky situations.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281f580.0x2917408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the August 2017 issue, I wrote about how to prepare for a vacation so you aren't
disturbed by a work emergency. As part of that article, I described how to
prepare your computer:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Even better than taking a backup, leave your expensive work computer behind
and use a cheaper more disposable machine for travel, and just restore your
important files and settings for work on it before you leave and wipe it when
you return. If you decide to go the disposable computer route, I recommend
working one or two full work days on this computer before the vacation to
make sure all of your files and settings are in place.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It turns out that this advice works not just for travel but also for a laptop you
take with you while on call. So in this article, I elaborate on the above advice
and describe some strategies for choosing and setting up an appropriate laptop
to take with you while on call or traveling.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281f580.0x29176c8"></a>
Why Choose a Different Laptop?</h2></div></div><p>
I was faced with the dilemma of choosing a travel laptop when I went on vacation a
few months ago. I needed to be reachable while on vacation, just in case, but I
knew I didn't want to lug around and cross borders with an expensive company
laptop. There are a number of reasons why this is a good idea, and most of the
reasons you would want to use a separate, cheap laptop for travel also apply
for an on-call laptop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281f580.0x29177d0"></a>
Less Concern over Loss, Damage or Theft</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's true that your laptop might get lost, stolen or damaged while you
commute to work, it's much more likely to happen outside your normal work
routine. While you are on call, you might take your laptop to restaurants, bars,
events or a friend's house, and because you are outside your normal routine,
it's more likely that it will be stolen or that you might accidentally leave it
behind. Also
when you are commuting to work, you likely have some kind of backpack or case for
your laptop, but outside work, you may be more likely just to throw your laptop
in the trunk of your car.
</p><p>
While traveling, especially traveling abroad, you are most definitely outside
your normal routine, and a laptop is even more likely to get lost, damaged or
stolen. The more expensive laptop you have with you, the more enticing of a
target, and the more you have to lose. Also, with increased security around
airports and customs these days, laptops are more likely to be inspected,
confiscated or forced into checked luggage. Plus, if you do have to put
your laptop in checked luggage, these days, you must lock your luggage with keys
that security agents can unlock. Unfortunately, there are many stories of
unscrupulous airport employees who have taken advantage of this fact to steal
high-value items from luggage while it's out of its owner's possession.

An Immediate Backup for Your Work Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
Having a second laptop that's ready at any moment to take over work duties adds an
extra backup in case your work laptop itself breaks. Instead of being out of
commission while you are waiting for a replacement, you immediately can resume
work on your backup. It also provides you with a backup in case you leave your
work laptop at the office.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281f580.0x2917a38"></a>
How to Choose Your Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
The key to a good on-call or travel laptop is to get
something cheap. As computers
have continued to get faster, the fact is that many people can get their general
work done (especially in a pinch) with laptops that are many years old. This is
especially true on a Linux desktop, even if you aren't someone who spends a decent
amount of time on a terminal.
</p><p>
Used Thinkpads are a great choice for travel laptops, because they have good Linux
compatibility and are rugged and easy to repair with replacement parts that are
easy to find. Because so many organizations have used them as company laptops,
you almost always can find a used one cheap on an auction site. Keep an eye out
for a model that is listed as having no OS. Those laptops tend to be cheaper
because people want to avoid having to install an OS, but as Linux users, we would
just overwrite the OS anyway! I've consistently found that if I'm patient, I can
get a Thinkpad with reasonable specs for less than $50 on auction sites. If you are
willing to splurge on extra RAM or an SSD, these old machines can be surprisingly
speedy.
</p><p>
Another option, especially if you want a more portable laptop, is a Chromebook.
Although these machines normally are designed to run a limited, secured OS that
centers on Google services, they also can run Linux well once you switch into
developer mode. Some people use cheap Chromebooks as their default travel
computers since they just want to check Gmail and browse the web while traveling.
Personally,
I found a used Acer C710 for $40 and was able to add RAM and an SSD from a spare
Thinkpad, and it turned out to be a rather capable Qubes-compatible machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281f580.0x2917c48"></a>
Setting Up Your Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
I use Qubes both on my work and personal laptops, and I've long used its
built-in backup and restore tool whenever I travel to make sure I have a fresh
backup in case my laptop is lost or stolen. Now that I rely on a separate laptop
for travel, I just restore that fresh backup onto my travel machine and test it
by working on it for a day before the trip. This also means I can selectively
restore only the files and settings (appVMs in my case) that are relevant for the
situation. In the case of its use as an on-call computer, I don't have to worry as
much about fresh backups as long as all of my VPN, SSH and other credentials are
kept up to date.
</p><p>
Since most people don't use Qubes, just take advantage of whatever tool you prefer
to back up your laptop (you do back up your laptop regularly, don't you?) and restore
onto your spare computer as regularly as you need to keep important files up to
date. Given that you are doing this to protect against the laptop being lost or stolen,
be sure to enable full disk encryption when you install the OS to help protect
your sensitive files just in case. For those of you who are extra
security-conscious, you can take the additional step of wiping and re-installing your OS
whenever you return from a long trip, just in case you are worried about any
malware that found its way on your computer while you were on untrusted
networks.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In general, I highly recommend selecting a cheap laptop for your on-call and travel
computer. You will find you have extra peace of mind knowing that not only
will it be inexpensive to replace your laptop if it's lost, broken or
stolen, but also that you
when you return home, you can get on your regular computer
and get right back to work.
