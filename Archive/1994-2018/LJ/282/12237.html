iStorage diskAshur Storage Drives</h2></div></div><p>
With software-free setup and operation, the new iStorage diskAshur group of
ultra-secure storage drives works across all operating systems, including Linux,
macOS, Android, Chrome, thin and zero clients, MS Windows and embedded systems.
Available in HDD and SDD versions, these high-speed USB 3.1, PIN-authenticated,
hardware-encrypted portable data storage drives feature iStorage's unique EDGE
technology. iStorage calls the EDGE technology&mdash;short for Enhanced Dual
Generating Encryption&mdash;super-spy-like, due to the advanced security
features that make diskAshur the &ldquo;most secure data storage drives available on
the market&rdquo;. For one thing, without the PIN, there's no way in!
diskAshur's dedicated, hardware-based secure microprocessor (Common Criteria
EAL4+-ready) employs built-in physical protection mechanisms designed to defend
against external tamper, bypass laser attacks and fault injections. The drives
feature technology that encrypts both the data and the encryption key, ensuring
that private information is secure and protected. Other security features include
a brute-force hack defense mechanism, self-destruct feature, unattended auto-lock
and a wear-resistant epoxy-coated keypad. The diskAshur drives are elegantly
designed and available in four striking colors and in capacity options from 128GB
to 5TB.

LINBIT's DRBD Top</h2></div></div><p>
Many proprietary high-availability (HA) software providers require users to pay
extra for system-management capabilities. Bucking this convention and driving down
costs is LINBIT, whose DRBD HA software solution, part of the Linux kernel since
2009, powers thousands of digital enterprises. The cost savings originate from
LINBIT's DRBD Top, a new software tool to simplify the management of the
LINBIT DRBD application. Via DRBD Top's unified graphical interface,
administrators can navigate their DRBD resources conveniently without typing
multiple commands. Available on Github, DRBD Top provides critical status,
assessment and troubleshooting capabilities for administrators who manage HA
clusters, especially those with greater than two nodes.

Datamation's &ldquo;Leading Big Data Companies&rdquo; Report</h2></div></div><p>
The Big Data market is in a period of remarkable transition. If keeping tabs on
this dynamic sector is in your wheelhouse, Datamation has made your homework
easier by developing &ldquo;Leading Big Data Companies&rdquo;, a report that provides &ldquo;a
snapshot of a market sector in transition&rdquo;. Ranging from established legacy
vendors to start-ups, this report details the numerous strategies that are
exploited in today's Big Data landscape. The core technologies employed by this
diverse group of vendors include cloud, open source, AI and several others. This
report belongs to Datamation's ongoing focus on the latest emerging tech for
the enterprise. In the mere seven years that have passed since Yahoo! introduced
Hadoop, Big Data has burgeoned in popularity as ever more firms seek insights from
the massive amounts of data at their disposal. Because Big Data has matured
differently from most technologies in that no single leader has emerged after
nearly a decade, the analytics industry finds itself still in growth mode, making
it dynamic and challenging for those trying to make sense of it on their own.

Lotfi ben Othmane, Martin Gilje Jaatun and Edgar Weippl's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Empirical Research for Software
Security</em></span> (CRC Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Developing truly secure software is no walk through the park. In an effort to
apply the scientific method to the art of secure software development, a trio of
authors&mdash;Lotfi ben Othmane, Martin Gilje Jaatun and Edgar Weippl&mdash;teamed up to
write <span   class="emphasis"><em>Empirical Research for Software Security: Foundations and
Experience</em></span>. The book is a guide for using empirical research methods to study
secure software challenges. Empirical methods, including data analytics, allow
extraction of knowledge and insights from the data that organizations gather from
their tools and processes, as well as from the opinions of the experts who
practice those methods and processes. These methods can be used to perfect a
secure software development lifecycle based on empirical data and published
industry best practices. The book also features examples that illustrate the
application of data analytics in the context of secure software engineering.

Neuranet's Flexitive</h2></div></div><p>
The new Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Standard Ad Unit Portfolio's
support for flexible ads is intended to improve the ad experience for users and
boost revenue potential for advertisers. An updated solution from Neuranet, its
Flexitive 2.0 responsive design software is designed to solve today's design
challenges and give media companies and agencies a significant advantage in
adapting to the IAB's new Flex Specifications and Lean Guidelines that were
released in summer 2017. Flexitive 2.0 is the next generation of Neuranet's
HTML5 cloud-based platform that supports more advanced responsive design
capabilities for building high-quality, animated HTML5-based designs that adapt to
unlimited sizes across any device, operating system, app or browser. The new
standards were designed to promote user-friendly digital advertising that can
scale across device types easily. Flexitive also incorporates the LEAN principles
of lightweight, encrypted, AdChoices-supported and non-invasive advertising.
Neuranet emphasizes other key features of Flexitive 2.0, such as an easy-to-use
drag-and-drop interface that requires no coding knowledge, unlimited sizing of a
single design, two-click creative design variations with instant scaling, export
for use in more than 30 ad servers and more.

InfluxData</h2></div></div><p>
What is ephemeral data, you ask? InfluxData can supply the answer, because
handling it is the business of the company's InfluxData open-source platform
that is custom-built for metrics and events. Ephemeral data is transitory,
existing only briefly, and is becoming vital for modern applications built where
containers, microservices and sensors can come and go and are intermittently
connected. The updated InfluxData 1.3 Platform can handle a billion (yes, with a
&ldquo;b&rdquo;!) unique time series, making it easier to handle ephemeral data coming
from containers or adding and removing sensors in IoT-tracking systems. InfluxData
addresses the explosion of data points and sources, monitoring and controls
requiring nanosecond precision coming from sensors and microservices. The
InfluxData platform provides a comprehensive set of tools and services to
accumulate metrics and events data, analyze the data and act on the data via
powerful visualizations and notifications. New features in release 1.3 include
time-series indexing, high-availability anomaly detection, query language
improvements and automatic cluster rebalancing. InfluxData calls the new release
&ldquo;one of the most significant technical advancements in the platform to
date&rdquo;.
