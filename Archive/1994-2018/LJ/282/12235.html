Playbooks make Ansible even more powerful than before.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aec358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
To be quite honest, if Ansible had nothing but its ad-hoc mode, it 
still would be a powerful and useful tool for automating large numbers of
computers. In fact, if it weren't for a few features, I might consider
sticking with ad-hoc mode and adding a bunch of those ad-hoc commands to
a Bash script and be done with learning. Those few additional features,
however, make the continued effort well worth it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aec510"></a>
Tame the Beast with YAML</h2></div></div><p>
Ansible goes out of its way to use an easy-to-read configuration file for
making &ldquo;playbooks&rdquo;, which are files full of separate Ansible
&ldquo;tasks&rdquo;. A
task is basically an ad-hoc command written out in a configuration file
that makes it more organized and easy to expand. The configuration
files use YAML, which stands for &ldquo;Yet Another Markup Language&rdquo;.
It's an easy-to-read markup language, but it does rely on whitespace,
which isn't terribly common with most config files. A simple playbook
looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: this installs a package
      apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

    - name: this restarts the apache service
      service: name=apache2 enabled=yes state=restarted
</pre>
</p><p>
The contents should be fairly easy to identify. It's basically two
ad-hoc commands broken up into a YAML configuration file. There are a
few important things to notice. First, every filename ends with .yaml,
and every YAML file must begin with three hyphen characters. Also, as
mentioned above, whitespace matters. Finally, when a hyphen should
precede a section and when it should just be spaced appropriately often
is confusing. Basically every new section needs to start with a - symbol,
but it's often hard to tell what should be its own section. Nevertheless,
it starts to feel natural as you create more and more playbooks.
</p><p>
The above playbook would be executed by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible-playbook filename.yaml
</pre>
</p><p>
And that is the equivalent of these two commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible webservers -b -m apt -a "name=apache2 
 &#8618;update_cache=yes state=latest"
ansible webservers -b -m service -a "name=apache2 
 &#8618;enabled=yes state=restarted"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aec930"></a>
Handling Your Handlers</h2></div></div><p>
But a bit of organization is really only the beginning of why playbooks
are so powerful. First off, there's the idea of &ldquo;Handlers&rdquo;, which are
tasks that are executed only when &ldquo;notified&rdquo; that a task has made a
change. How does that work exactly? Let's rewrite the above YAML file
to make the second task a handler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: this installs a package
      apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest
      notify: enable apache

  handlers:
    - name: enable apache
      service: name=apache2 enabled=yes state=started
</pre>
</p><p>
On the surface, this looks very similar to just executing multiple
tasks. When the first task (installing Apache) executes, if a change
is made, it notifies the &ldquo;enable apache&rdquo; handler, which makes sure
Apache is enabled on boot and currently running. The significance is that
if Apache is already installed, and no changes are made, the handler
never is called. That makes the code much more efficient, but it also
means no unnecessary interruption of the already running Apache process.
</p><p>
There are other subtle time-saving issues with handlers too&mdash;for example, multiple
tasks can call a handler, but it executes only a single time regardless of
how many times it's called. But the really significant thing to remember
is that handlers are executed (notified) only when an Ansible task makes
a change on the remote system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aecca0"></a>
Just the Facts, Ma'am</h2></div></div><p>
Variable substitution works quite simply inside a playbook. Here's a simple
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    package_name: apache2
  tasks:
    - name: this installs a package
      apt: "name={{ package_name }} update_cache=yes state=latest"
      notify: enable apache

  handlers:
    - name: enable apache
      service: "name={{ package_name }} enabled=yes state=started"
</pre>
</p><p>
It should be fairly easy to understand what's happening above. Note
that I did put the entire module action section in quotes. It's not
always required, but sometimes Ansible is funny about unquoted variable
substitutions, so I always try to put things in quotes when variables
are involved.
</p><p>
The really interesting thing about variables, however, are the &ldquo;Gathered
Facts&rdquo; about every host. You might notice when executing a playbook that
the first thing Ansible does is &ldquo;Gathering Facts...&rdquo;, which completes
without error, but doesn't actually seem to do anything. What's really
happening is that system information is getting populated into variables
that can be used inside a playbook. To see the entire list of &ldquo;Gathered
Facts&rdquo;, you can execute an ad-hoc command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible webservers -m setup
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll get a <span   class="emphasis"><em>huge</em></span> list of facts generated from the individual hosts. Some
of them are particularly useful. For example,
<tt  >ansible_os_family</tt> will
return something like &ldquo;RedHat&rdquo; or &ldquo;Debian&rdquo; depending on which distribution
you're using. Ubuntu and Debian systems both return &ldquo;Debian&rdquo;, while
Red Hat
and CentOS will return &ldquo;RedHat&rdquo;. Although that's certainly interesting
information, it's really useful when different distros use different
tools&mdash;for example, apt vs. yum.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aed278"></a>
Getting Verbose</h2></div></div><p>
One of the frustrations of moving from Ansible ad-hoc commands to playbooks
is that in playbook mode, Ansible tends to keep fairly quiet with regard
to output. With ad-hoc mode, you often can see what is going on,
but with a playbook, you know only if it finished okay, and if a change
was made. There are two easy ways to change that. The first is just
to add the <tt  >-v</tt> flag when executing
<tt  >ansible-playbook</tt>. That adds verbosity
and provides lots of feedback when things are executed. Unfortunately,
it often gives so much information, that usefulness gets lost in the
mix. Still, in a pinch, just adding the <tt  >-v</tt> flag helps.
</p><p>
If you're creating a playbook and want to be notified of things along
the way, the debug module is really your friend. In ad-hoc mode, the
debug module doesn't make much sense to use, but in a playbook, it can
act as a &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; tool about what is going on. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: describe hosts
     debug: msg="Computer {{ ansible_hostname }} is running 
      &#8618;{{ ansible_os_family }} or equivalent"
</pre>
</p><p>
The above will show you something like Figure 1, which is incredibly useful when
you're trying to figure out the sort of systems you're using. The nice
thing about the debug module is that it can display anything you want,
so if a value changes, you can have it displayed on the screen so you can
troubleshoot a playbook that isn't working like you expect it to work. It
is important to note that the debug module doesn't do anything other than
display information on the screen for you. It's not a logging system;
rather, it's just a way to have information (customized information,
unlike the verbose flag) displayed during execution. Still, it can be
invaluable as your playbooks become more complex.

Figure 1. Debug mode is the best way to get some information on what's 
happening inside your playbooks.

If This Then That</h2></div></div><p>
Conditionals are a part of pretty much every programming language. Ansible
YAML files also can take advantage of conditional execution, but the
format is a little wacky. Normally the condition comes
first, and then if it evaluates as true, the following code executes. With
Ansible, it's a little backward. The task is completely spelled out, then
a <tt  >when</tt> statement is added at the end. It makes the code very readable,
but as someone who's been using if/then mentality his entire career,
it feels funny. Here's a slightly more complicated playbook. See if you
can parse out what would happen in an environment with both Debian/Ubuntu
and Red Hat/CentOS systems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install apache this way
      apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest
      notify: start apache2
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: install apache that way
      yum: name=httpd state=latest
      notify: start httpd
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

  handlers:
    - name: start apache2
      service: name=apache2 enabled=yes state=started

    - name: start httpd
      service: name=httpd enabled=yes state=started
</pre>
</p><p>
Hopefully the YAML format makes that fairly easy to read. Basically,
it's a playbook that will install Apache on hosts using either yum or
apt based on which type of distro they have installed. Then handlers
make sure the newly installed packages are enabled and running.
</p><p>
It's easy to see how useful a combination of gathered facts and
conditional statements can be. Thankfully, Ansible doesn't stop there. As
with other configuration management systems, it includes most features
of programming and scripting languages. For example, there are loops.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2aeda60"></a>
Play It Again, Sam</h2></div></div><p>
If there is one thing Ansible does well, it's
loops. Quite frankly,
it supports so many different sorts of loops, I can't cover them
all here. The best way to figure out the perfect sort of loop for
your situation is to read the Ansible documentation directly at
<a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_loops.html" target="_self">docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_loops.html</a>.
</p><p>
For simple lists, playbooks use a familiar, easy-to-read method for
doing multiple tasks. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks: 
    - name: install a bunch of stuff
      apt: "name={{ item }} state=latest update_cache=yes"
      with_items:
        - apache2
        - vim
        - chromium-browser
</pre>
</p><p>
This simple playbook will install multiple packages using the apt
module. Note the special variable named <tt  >item</tt>, which is replaced with
the items one at a time in the <tt  >with_items</tt> section. Again, this is
pretty easy to understand and utilize in your own playbooks. Other
loops work in similar ways, but they're formatted differently. Just check
out the documentation for the wide variety of ways Ansible can repeat
similar tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f4580.0x2ee6020"></a>
Templates</h2></div></div><p>
One last module I find myself using often is the template module. If
you've ever used mail merge in a word processor, templating works
similarly. Basically, you create a text file and then use variable
substitution to create a custom version on the fly. I most often do
this for creating HTML files or config files. Ansible uses the Jinja2
templating language, which is conveniently similar to standard variable
substitution in playbooks themselves. The example I almost always use
is a custom HTML file that can be installed on a remote batch of web
servers. Let's look at a fairly complex playbook and an accompanying HTML
template file.
</p><p>
Here's the playbook:

<pre     class="programlisting">
---

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
 
  tasks:
   - name: install apache2
     apt: name=apache2 state=latest update_cache=yes
     when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

   - name: install httpd
     yum: name=httpd state=latest
     when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

   - name: start apache2
     service: name=apache2 state=started enable=yes
     when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

   - name: start httpd
     service: name=httpd state=started enable=yes
     when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat

   - name: install index
     template:
       src: index.html.j2
       dest: /var/www/html/index.html
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's the template file, which must end in .j2 (it's the file referenced
in the last task above):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This computer is running {{ ansible_os_family }}, 
and its hostname is:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;{{ ansible_hostname }}&lt;/h3&gt;
{# this is a comment, which won't be copied to the index.html file #}
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This also should be fairly easy to understand. The playbook takes a
few different things it learned and installs Apache on the remote
systems, regardless of whether they are Red Hat- or Debian-based. Then, it
starts the web servers and makes sure the web server starts on system
boot. Finally, the playbook takes the template file, index.html.j2,
and substitutes the variables while copying the file to the remote
system. Note the <tt  >{# #}</tt> format for making comments. Those comments are
completely erased on the remote system and are visible only in the .j2
file on the Ansible machine.

The Sky Is the Limit!</h2></div></div><p>
I'll finish up this series in my next article, where I plan to cover how to build
on your
playbook knowledge to create entire roles and take advantage of the
community contributions available. Ansible is a very powerful tool that
is surprisingly simple to understand and use. If you've been experimenting
with ad-hoc commands, I encourage you to create playbooks
that will allow you to do multiple tasks on a multitude of computers with
minimal effort. At the very least, play around with the &ldquo;Facts&rdquo; gathered
by the ansible-playbook app, because those are things unavailable to
the ad-hoc mode of Ansible. Until next time, learn, experiment, play
and have fun!
