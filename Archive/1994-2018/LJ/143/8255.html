A primer on getting started with Eclipse views, editors and plugins.

This article presents a set of best practices for
use when developing Eclipse plugins for
application development environments built on
the Eclipse platform. The general principles of
plugin development outlined in this article can be
applied to many other Eclipse-based development
environments, in addition to the downloadable
version. Several aspects of the Eclipse plugin
development process are covered here, including the
View versus Editor debate, the inside or
outside choice, some standard widget toolkit
(SWT) basics and the usefulness of the
Eclipse Plugin Wizard. The advantages of using
Eclipse for developing Eclipse plugins also are
covered. The article also includes a walk-through of a
simple application plugin with an eye toward
reuse across multiple Eclipse application
plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3d580.0x1d353a0"></a>
The View vs. Editor Debate</h2></div></div><p>
In Eclipse, the two basic ways of presenting any type
of information to the user are with a View or
an Editor. Both Views and Editors allow the user
to select certain actions to be performed by the
plugin by single- or double-clicking on an item, by
a right-click pop-up menu or by a top-level
pull-down menu item.
</p><p>
The Editor class can do almost everything that the
View class can do, plus a whole lot more. Allowing
all this extra functionality comes at a price, however,
in both system and code complexity. In general,
the Editor class requires much more effort to
develop than a View, so a certain amount of decision
making must occur before embarking on an
Editor implementation.
</p><p>
Views are sufficient when simply providing
information to a user and allowing certain built-in
capabilities is required. Users can input data to Views with
relative ease usually by using other widgets in the SWT,
such as tables and text boxes. But, what if you want
more of a free-form interaction with the user? In
addition, what if you want to have user inputs that
are persistent across multiple launches of Eclipse?
</p><p>
A good general guideline to use in this debate is
the issue of persistence. Although it is possible to
retain data from a View in some kind of persistent
repository, in most cases this requires some level
of work to be done in a file or file-like context. If this is
the case, it often is easier simply to implement an
Editor instead.
</p><p>
The second most common consideration is the actual
data being presented. If the user can select multiple
data units and perform actions using them or
against them on a one-at-a-time basis, it
usually is easier to implement the operation or
operations as a distinct View.
</p><p>
In this article, we implement a sample
Eclipse plugin. This plugin has a simple goal: to
provide generic application-level data to the user.
This data is going to be represented as strings, although
almost any data type could be substituted. The
usual left-click, right-click and double-click
actions are going to be enabled, but only double-clicking
is modified as a reusable example for all
other action implementations.
</p><p>
As there is no immediate need for a persistent
resource and as there will be multiple instances of
data to select on a one-at-a-time basis, the sample
plugin capability is going to be implemented as a View,
which we simply call the DataView.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3d580.0x1d356b8"></a>
The Inside or Outside Choice</h2></div></div><p>
When implementing either Views or Editors, another decision must
be made. Should the data be
presented to the user within the actual Eclipse
environment or outside of it somehow? The SWT
provides Form classes that allow you to externalize
your application data if you choose.
</p><p>
Editors can be implemented either externally or
internally, but external Editors lack easy access to
the plugin itself. Surprisingly, existing vendor plugins provide
exactly this kind of functionality. In most of these cases, this
is chosen because of the loss of plugin access as
vendors decide to lock out the user from certain
levels of Eclipse functionality.
In general, the proper
choice for plugin Editors&mdash;notwithstanding the user
debate over openness in tools&mdash;is to implement
Editors internally in Eclipse. It simply doesn't
make much sense to lose access to the rest of the
plugin if you don't have to. Now, what about Views?
</p><p>
Similar to Editors, Views can be implemented
either externally as a separate Form class or
internally as a View with additional SWT widgets.
There are no hard and fast rules here, but there are
some basic guidelines to follow when dealing with
this decision. In general, two things should be considered. First,
can the View data be described as unique and discrete entities, with fields
or operations specific to that particular data item? Second, are
there always less than about nine of these
items? If so, the View can be implemented as a View
with a Table or perhaps a View with separate Tabs
for each discrete unit.
</p><p>
If the actual number of instances of the data
and the types of operations on that data is
at all dynamic or unknown&mdash;for example, the
developer does not know a priori exactly
how many items there will be or exactly how many distinct
operations to design or to allow for in the future&mdash;it
probably is best to implement the View as an external Form
class.
</p><p>
The sample plugin developed in this article is a
simple 100-item implementation displaying data
with only two distinct fields for each item, a name
and a value. Although there are no predefined system
requirements for more than nine multiple
operations, there also are no explicit multiple
operations defined. Therefore, you safely can
assume that it will not require a great deal of
them either&mdash;it is supposed to be simple after all.
The DataView plugin therefore should be implemented
as an internal View.

Getting Started with the Eclipse Environment</h2></div></div><p>
To start the actual plugin development, you need
to start with an Eclipse installation. For this
example, we downloaded the latest Eclipse version at the time of this
writing,
v3.0.2, from the Eclipse site. As we use the CDT
plugin for C and C++ development extensively in
our own organization, we then downloaded the
CDT v2.1 Project. It can be accessed under the
Eclipse Tools Project from the projects link on the
main Eclipse page. You can download both of these
as .zip files, which extract into a /eclipse directory. Therefore,
make sure you install the Eclipse zip file prior to the
CDT zip file. In our case, we were building on Red
Hat Linux 9.0 using the GTK- version of both the
Eclipse framework and the CDT plugin, but the
Motif versions work equally as well. We then brought
up Eclipse with <tt  >./eclipse</tt> and selected the Plugin
Development Environment (PDE) perspective from
Window&rarr;Open Perspective.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3d580.0x1d35a80"></a>
Using the Eclipse Plugin Wizard</h2></div></div><p>
Many texts on Eclipse plugin development walk
users through the Hello World type of project. It
is this author's belief that although that might be a
good start for novice programmers, it is absolutely the
worst way for experienced software developers to
begin using Eclipse. It takes too long, and worst of all,
much of the work has to be redone once you
need to create a real plugin. Instead, we usually
recommend creating as nearly complete a plugin
project as possible, using as many pre-existing
templates as the environment allows. Doing so gives you a
considerable amount of functionality immediately.
You then can develop your own customizations of the
existing functionality without worrying about being
properly attached or hooked to the normal plugin-type environment.
</p><p>
In the PDE, the Plugin Wizard allows a developer
to create a sample plugin project quickly and easily,
simply by selecting File&rarr;New&rarr;Plug-in
Project. When prompted for a name of the plugin,
we use a common syntax used by other
commercial vendors. That is, we name the plugin
with the text com.companyName.productName
or in this example, com.mcc.dataView, as shown in
Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8255f1.large.jpg"><img src="8255f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. To start a new plugin, select
File&rarr;New-Plug-in Project to bring up the Plugin
Wizard.
</p></div></div><p>
It is easy enough to remove functionality from the
plugin project once we get started on some actual
customizations, so we select Next for two
screens until we reach the Templates screen. We then
select Create a plugin using one of the
template's boxes and choose to use the Custom
Plugin Wizard. You then select Next to see the templates to be created.
</p><p>
You could remove specific functionality at this point, but for this
exercise,
we retain all functionality and simply keep
selecting Next until we reach the Main View
Settings window. In this window, we rename
the Sample View as Data View, as shown in
Figure 2. Once you have modified this window
appropriately, you can select Finish or cycle
through the last of the customization sections,
which is View Features. You can move forward
and back during this process, so take your time.
No changes are made to the environment until
the Finish button is selected.

Figure 2. Give your plugin a name in the Main View
Settings window.
</p></div></div><p>
If you mess it up the first time, as this
author did, don't hesitate to delete the entire
project including the directory contents and start
again until you get it right. Once the plugin has
been created to your exact template specifications,
you are ready to execute the plugin for the first time.
For this we use the run-time workbench.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3d580.0x1d36058"></a>
Testing the Plugin Using the Run-time Workbench</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most attractive features of the Eclipse
framework is its own ability to develop, test, debug
and execute plugins in the run-time workbench.
Few development environments provide exactly this
kind of functionality in such an easy-to-use and
intuitive fashion. This removes many of the
time-wasting impediments to developers stuck in the
long compile-build-debug cycle typical of other
development environments.
</p><p>
To execute the DataView plugin, simply select
Run&rarr;Run As&rarr;6 Run-time workbench from the
PDE perspective.
The Eclipse PDE spawns a completely separate
user workspace, called the run-time workspace, and
executes the DataView plugin. On the first execution
of the plugin, you need to select the
Window&rarr;Show View&rarr;Other top-level menu pull-down,
and choose the DataView listed under the specific
Views heading that you selected during plugin
creation.
</p><p>
In future executions, the run-time workbench
functions much as the regular workspace functions
and retains the appropriate View layout between
multiple launches. This greatly simplifies testing,
as re-testing is only a matter of running the run-time
workbench again.
</p><p>
One of the few drawbacks to the run-time workbench
model is its rough doubling of host RAM usage due to
executing the equivalent of two Eclipse sessions on a
single machine. In systems with limited RAM, such as
laptop environments, this can be a bit slow and
frustrating. As JVMs improve, though, this problem does get
better.
</p><p>
Experiment with the sample plugin menus and
pull-downs to get a feel for what functionality you
have created. Even though we don't discuss
Editor customizations in this article, you also might
want to experiment with creating a simple Eclipse
project and then creating a new file with a .mpe
extension. Doing so allows you to get familiar with
the concept of multipage editors similar to the
one used for displaying the plugin.xml file now
listed under your new plugin project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3d580.0x1d362c0"></a>
Customizing the Plugin View</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in customizing the DataView is
to add a new ViewLabelProvider class to the plugin
project under the Views folder. This allows you to
add data to the table to be displayed in
the DataView window when the plugin is executing.
The ViewLabelProvider interacts with the
ParameterControl class by providing the data
stored there, a Name and a Value, to the DataView.
A complete listing of this class can be found in the
project tar file.
</p><p>
The next step in customizing the DataView is to
add the ParameterControl class that is referenced
by the ViewLableProvider class to the plugin
project under the Views folder. This class
maintains the actual parameter names and values
to be displayed in the DataView table.
Although a relatively simple implementation, it easily can
be scaled to a greater number of fields if
necessary. A complete listing of this class also can
be found in the project tar file.
</p><p>
The third step in customizing the DataView is to
add a Table with the appropriate settings to the
DataView class (see Listing 1 on the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
FTP site), modify the
Plugin class itself to support the UserParameter
variable and customize the DoubleClick action
to display the table entry data. Note the addition
of a new function called UpdateTheTable that
provides the latest data to the Table. This
function would be the modification point for new
application data by way of the filesystem or network or
whatever. For this example only, the first four
parameters are modified for new data.
The full code for our plugin is available from the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
The final modification is to add a ParameterControl
variable and its initialization to the plugin itself.
This is done by adding the variable declaration to
the DataViewPlugin.java file, at the first point after the
resourceBundle is declared. The variable
declaration should be as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

//User Parameter functionality
public ParameterControl userParameters[] =
    new ParameterControl[100];

</pre>
</p><p>
Next the initialization section is added at the end
of the Plugin constructor as shown:

<pre     class="programlisting">

// Additions for User Parameter functionality
int index;
for (index = 0; index &lt; 100; index++)
{
    userParameters[index] =
        new ParameterControl("Parameter "
         + (index + 1), "Value " + (index + 1));

}

</pre>
</p><p>
The final run-time workbench execution of the
plugin is shown in Figure 3. In the figure, the
user has double-clicked on an item, producing a
simple user dialog that displays the actual data
for the table selection made.

user input.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we discovered some basic
rules to follow when making decisions about how
an Eclipse plugin should present application data to
a user by way of an Eclipse View. We have utilized the
Eclipse Plugin Wizard to auto-generate much of the
plugin initialization code in a testable and reusable
format. We also have reviewed certain usage examples of
the SWT, including Tables, Viewers and
LabelProviders, and their uses in the context of a
User View. Finally, we have seen some of the advantages
and disadvantages of using the run-time workbench
feature of Eclipse.
</p><p>
Along the way, we created a relatively simple
sample plugin that can be used over and over
again as a starting point for new Eclipse plugins.
The sample plugin easily accommodates future
growth in the plugin itself by enabling all
typical plugin functionality, such as multipage
editors, properties, wizards and reference
extensions. This additional plugin functionality
now can be implemented in an iterative fashion,
allowing not only for future growth of the specific
plugin but easier reuse across multiple plugin
developments. It also can serve as a starting point
for new developers with little or no prior
knowledge of Eclipse development. This reusability
aspect is one of the most compelling features of
the Eclipse framework.
