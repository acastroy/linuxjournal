Here is a subversive way to handle multiple versions of your
personal information instead of just versions of code.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b3c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Have you ever needed some information from a file, only to remember that
you modified the file a week ago and removed the very information you're
interested in? Or, have you ever spent hours sifting through dozens of
inconsistently named copies of the same file trying to find one particular
version? If you're like me, the answer is probably a resounding yes
to both questions. Of course, if you're a programmer, you've probably
already solved that problem in your development activities by using a
version control system like CVS or Subversion. What about everything
else though? Mom's cherry pie recipe may not change as frequently as
rpc_init.c, but if you do decide to create a low-cal version, you're not
going to want to lose the original. As it turns out, version control
isn't only for source files anymore. Many of the features of Subversion
make it ideal for versioning all kinds of files.
</p><p>
With Subversion, you can keep a history of changes made to your files.
That way, you easily can go back and see exactly what a given
file contained at a particular point in time. You also save space,
because it stores deltas from one version to the next. That way, when
you make a change to a versioned file, it needs only enough extra space
to store the changes rather than a complete second copy of the file.
Also, unlike with CVS, delta storage on Subversion also applies to binary
files as well as text files.
</p><p>
Subversion makes it easy to access your files from multiple computers
too. Instead of worrying whether the copy of the budget report on your
laptop reflects the changes you made last night on your desktop system
at home, you can simply run an update on your laptop and Subversion
automatically updates your file to the latest version in the repository.
Also, because all of the versions are stored in a single repository,
there is a single location that you need to back up in order to keep all
of your data safe.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b3c500"></a>
What to Version</h2></div></div><p>
So your interest is piqued. You're sold on the advantages of versioning
your files, and you'd like to give it a try. The first question
to answer is what files you're going to put under version control.
One obvious possibility would be to version your entire hard drive.
In practice though, that's not a very practical approach. When you
store a portion of a repository's contents locally (in what's called
a working copy), Subversion stores a second copy of each file to allow
it to compare locally changes you have made with the last version from
the repository. Therefore, if you version the entire hard drive, you'll
need twice as much hard drive.
</p><p>
There's also little reason to keep full revision history on the largely
static parts of your filesystem, such as /usr or /opt. On the other hand,
directories that contain a lot of custom files/modifications, such as
/etc or /home, are prime candidates for versioning, because the advantage of
tracking those changes is more likely to outweigh the disadvantages of
extra storage requirements. Furthermore, with Subversion, you can opt
to create a working copy from a subtree in the repository hierarchy.
That way, you don't need to store any copies of infrequently accessed
data locally, which often results in a net reduction in hard drive
requirements, even though the files you are storing locally take up twice
as much space.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b3c660"></a>
Getting Subversion Up and Going</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's dive in and get Subversion running on your machine.
Installing is generally pretty easy. You can, of course, download the
Subversion source and compile that, but in most cases, it's going to be
much easier to install the precompiled binary package for your Linux
distribution of choice. Fortunately, Subversion has matured to the point
where such a package is available for almost every major distribution.
In fact, I don't know of any off the top of my head that it isn't
available for.
</p><p>
Once you have Subversion installed, it's time to create a repository.
Let's say you have a documents directory in your home that you'd like
to version. First, you need to create a new empty repository using the
<tt  >svnadmin create</tt> command. For instance, the
following creates a
new repository in your home directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svnadmin create $HOME/.documents_repository
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to import your existing documents into the newly created
repository. To do that, use the <tt  >svn import</tt> command with the directory
to import and a URL that points to the repository. In this example,
the URL refers directly to the repository using a file://-type URL.
If your repository will be used only locally, the file:// URL is the
easiest way to access a repository (there are other, better ways to
access repositories that I'll discuss in a bit though):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svn import $HOME/documents file://$HOME/.documents_repository
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run the import command, Subversion opens an editor and asks
you for a log message. Whatever message you enter will be associated with
the newly created repository revision and can be seen by examining the
repository history logs. Enter something brief, such as &ldquo;imported
documents directory&rdquo;. As soon as you save the log message and leave
the editor, Subversion performs the import and outputs something like
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Adding         documents/file1.txt
Adding         documents/file2.txt
Adding         documents/file3.jpg

Committed revision 1.
</pre>
</p><p>
You can now safely remove the original $HOME/documents and then re-create
it as a working copy of the repository, using the <tt  >svn
checkout</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rm -rf $HOME/documents
$ svn checkout file://$HOME/.documents_repository $HOME/documents
</pre>
</p><p>
So far, so good. However, if you want to take advantage of Subversion
from multiple machines, you're going to need to set up a server.
Several options are available to you, but the best choice is generally to
use Apache with mod_dav, which serves a Subversion repository using the
WebDAV protocol.
</p><p>
From a basic Apache installation, getting WebDAV to work is fairly
simple. First, you need to make sure that mod_dav and mod_dav_svn are
being loaded:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LoadModule      dav_module        modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule      dav_svn_module    modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to set up a &lt;Location&gt; directive to point to your
repository. For example, if you want your repository to be referenced
with the URL http://example.net/bill/documents, and the repository is
located in /srv/repositories/bill_documents, you could use the following
Location directive:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Location /bill/documents&gt;
   DAV svn
   SVNPath /srv/repositories/bill_documents
   AuthType None
&lt;/Location&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if you want more security, you could allow for valid users
only:
<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Location /bill/documents&gt;
   DAV svn
   SVNPath /srv/repositories/bill_documents
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Bill's Documents"
   AuthUserFile /srv/repositories/bill_documents/passwd
   Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b3cd98"></a>
Basics of Using Subversion</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have Subversion set up, let's take a look at some of
the basic commands you'll need to know. The basic command-line
Subversion client program is called svn, and all of the client commands
that you'll use are accessed through that program. To get a complete
list of the commands that are available, you can run <tt  >svn
help</tt>. You can
also run <tt  >svn help [command]</tt> to get help on a particular command.
</p><p>
The first basic command that you need to know is <tt  >svn
add</tt>. When you
create a new file in a working copy, Subversion doesn't add it to the
repository automatically. That way, you can control what gets versioned.
For example, it usually would be a waste of space to add an emacs scratch
file to your repository. Using <tt  >svn add</tt> is easy.
You simply need to
give it the names of any files or directories to be added, and they will
be scheduled for addition to the repository, assuming they reside inside
of a valid working copy. Note though, that I said
&ldquo;scheduled&rdquo;.
When you issue the <tt  >svn add</tt> command, Subversion doesn't actually add the
files to the repository yet. Instead, it schedules them to be added
at the next commit. That way, you add multiple files with several
<tt  >svn
add</tt> commands and still batch them together so that they are committed
as a single revision, along with any already-versioned files that have
been locally modified.
</p><p>
So what's a commit? Well, when you modify files inside a working
copy, the data isn't sent to the repository automatically. You need to
commit your changes to the repository with <tt  >svn
commit</tt>. The commit
command performs the work of actually sending your local changes to
the repository to create a new revision. Normally, if you're in the
working copy, you can simply issue <tt  >svn commit</tt> with
no options, and it
will recursively commit all changed files under your current directory.
However, if you don't want to commit all of the local changes, you can
specify only certain files by listing them on the command line.
</p><p>
Once a file has been added to the repository, it can be freely modified
locally and Subversion automatically determines what changes have been
made in order to send them to the repository when you perform a commit.
There is a restriction though. You can't just copy, move or delete
files with the standard <tt  >cp</tt>,
<tt  >mv</tt> or <tt  >rm</tt> commands. If you do, Subversion
won't know about the change and will lose track of the file. Instead, you
need to use the Subversion equivalents <tt  >svn cp</tt>,
<tt  >svn mv</tt> and <tt  >svn rm</tt>.
Syntactically, they work about the same as the local versions that you're
used to, but they also schedule their respective actions to be applied
to the repository on the next commit.
</p><p>
To find out the current status of a file in your working copy, you can
use <tt  >svn status</tt>. The status command shows you information such
as which files are not under version control, which files have been
modified and which files are scheduled for addition. For instance,
the following output shows two modified files and one that hasn't been
added to the repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svn status
?         .GroceryList.txt.swp
M         Frogs.png
M         GroceryList.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use the <tt  >svn update</tt> command to update your working copy to
the latest revision. If you're accessing only the Subversion repository
from a single computer, updating isn't necessary. However, if files are
being modified from multiple computers, you need to run <tt  >svn
update</tt>
in your working copy to get any changes that have been committed from
a different computer.

Autoversioning</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've explained the hard way of using Subversion to keep track
of your files, let's take a look at autoversioning. When you use
Apache as your Subversion repository server, it uses an extension of
the WebDAV protocol for transferring files to and from the repository.
An interesting side effect of this is that most operating systems can
mount shared WebDAV directories as a network filesystem, much like
Samba or NFS. That means you can mount a Subversion repository
and directly access the files without needing to store them locally in a
working copy. This can have several advantages that make it really nice
for dealing with your personal files. For one, a new version is created
every time a file is saved. That way, you have a complete save history of
your files without worrying about whether you've done a commit recently.
You also add files to the repository merely by creating them, and can
do copies, moves or deletes with the standard filesystem commands.
Furthermore, if you access your repository from multiple computers,
you always know that you're accessing the most recent version without
remembering to run <tt  >svn update</tt>.
</p><p>
Of course, autoversioning does have its downsides. For one, it
requires a reasonably fast network connection to the computer that's
serving the repository, so it may not be practical for a laptop that's
frequently used away from home; although if you have access to a network
connection back to the server, it's always possible to copy files to your
local hard drive, edit them and then copy them back to the repository.
Another downside to autoversioning is that you can access only the most
recent repository revision. If you want to access older revisions of
files, you have to download them locally, which can be done
either by checking out a directory at a specific revision:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svn checkout -r 1563 http://$MY_SERVER/docs/pics/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b3d898"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or by using <tt  >svn cat</tt> to download a single file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svn cat -r 1563 http://$MY_SERVER/docs/pics/beach.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're going to use autoversioning to mount your repository under
Linux, you need to install davfs. Once it is installed, mounting
the repository is easy. All you need to do is run
<tt  >mount.davfs</tt>, like
in the following example, which mounts the repository $MY_SERVER/docs
at /mnt/documents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mount.davfs http://$MY_SERVER/docs/ /mnt/documents
</pre>
</p><p>
Before you can use autoversioning though, you also have to turn it
on in Apache. To do that, you need to add the SVNAutoversioning on
option to your &lt;Location&gt; directive for the Subversion repository.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Subversion is a system with a large feature list, many of which I
haven't even touched on. You should know enough now to get started with
versioning your files though. I've been using it for my files for a
while now and find it to be very helpful. I find it especially useful when
used with autoversioning, which makes it an almost seamless integration
with the filesystem.

Connecting from OS X
</b></p><p>
Okay, I admit it. I'm a Mac guy. As a Mac guy, my PowerBook gets a lot
of use on my home network, so being able to access my files from
there easily is pretty important to me. Fortunately, Subversion
makes my life easy here. Subversion runs on OS X just as easily as it
does on Linux, and it is a breeze to install. If you use the Fink package
management system for installing open-source software on your Mac, you
can install Subversion from there, or you can get standalone binaries.
</p><p>
If you decide to take advantage of autoversioning, you'll also be very
pleased with OS X. Mounting an autoversioned repository is as easy as
selecting Connect to Server... from the Finder's Go menu and entering
the repository's URL. The repository will be mounted in /Volumes,
and it will appear on the desktop as a mounted network share.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a44580.0x1b34860"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Connecting from Windows XP
</b></p><p>
Whether you use it for games, work, placation of a less-technical spouse
or just because you like it, the chances are pretty good that there's
at least one Windows machine on your network. The good news is that
Subversion was designed as a cross-platform application and is very
well supported under Windows. Precompiled binaries of the command-line
client are available from the Subversion downloads page. Additionally,
there is an excellent GUI client for Windows that integrates with the
Windows Explorer, called TortoiseSVN.
</p><p>
Windows XP also supports autoversioning through WebFolders, although
you'll want to use the old Explorer-extension version of WebFolders
rather than the newer version that was introduced with WinXP, as the new
version suffers from incompatibilities. To connect to a repository you
simply need to add a new network place and enter the repository URL, with
the port number appended. For example, to connect to a repository at
example.com/documents, you'd use the URL http://example.com:80/documents.
