With all of the evil-doers on the Internet, even most new
computer users understand the importance of having a secure firewall.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15cc580.0x16c42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like most Linux users, I started out using a simple Bash script to
configure the firewall policy on my Linux machines. Eventually, I got
tired of writing the same code over and over again, so I decided to
use a few program loops to try to factor out some of the redundancy. I
also decided that I'd like to separate the actual policy from the rest
of the program; this meant that the program would be reading external
configuration files. As my Perl skills are vastly better than my Bash
skills, I decided to write my firewall rules in Perl.
</p><p>
The program I'm outlining in this article could just as easily have been
written in Bash or another scripting language (or even C++, for that
matter). The language isn't important. The important thing to realize
is that once you write a program like this and debug it, all you have
to do to modify security rules is change a configuration file and rerun
the script. The configuration files should have an intuitive format so
that they are easy for humans to read, understand and modify.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the Perl script. I practice top-down programming, so
the first several lines of code should give you a good idea of what the
program does. Hopefully, you should be able to follow what the program
does even if you aren't a Perl programmer.

As you can see, the program isn't very long and certainly isn't very
complicated. However, the program is flexible enough to allow me to
whitelist or blacklist either individual machines or entire
networks completely. As we'll see later on, the build_chains() and add_rules()
functions implement a rule-pruning algorithm that keeps the Linux kernel
from having to evaluate irrelevant rules.
</p><p>
The set_ip_forwarding() function does what its name implies; it
tells the Linux kernel either to forward IP packets, or not to forward
packets. The function accepts a single parameter, either 0 or 1, which
determines whether the kernel will forward. The script initially turns
all forwarding off while it loads the firewall policy. Then, right before
the script exits, the script turns forwarding back on. The reason for
these extra steps is that we want the router to be in a safe state
while we load the actual rules. It's better to block all traffic than
it is to allow even one attack through.
</p><p>
The load interfaces() function reads in the names of the network
interfaces and assigns mnemonic labels to them. These labels are
then used in the rest of the configuration to refer to the actual
interfaces. Being able to refer to an interface as lan or even
vpn_to_work cuts down on misconfigurations. This also makes it easy to
make changes in order to tailor the firewall for use by my friends. In
many cases, I simply adjust the interfaces.conf file to reflect my
friend's network and suddenly, my friend has a reasonable firewall
configuration.
</p><p>
The script works via four configuration files: interfaces.conf,
good_hosts.conf, bad_hosts.conf and ports.conf.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows the contents of my interfaces.conf file. As you can see,
I've got six network interfaces in my router. My Internet connection is
on eth5. I've got a 10/100TX Ethernet for the house wiring. I've got
a Gigabit Ethernet connecting my MythTV PVR to the router for file
storage. I've got interfaces for the Wi-Fi and VoIP. Finally, I have a
VPN connection to some of my friend's computers. It's much easier to
remember that lan is my 10/100 copper network as opposed to trying
to remember whether eth3 is my VoIP or Wi-Fi interface. The last thing you
want to do is apply the right firewall rule to the wrong interface.

lo = lo
gig = eth0
lan = eth1
wifi = eth2
voip = eth3
wan = eth5
tun = tun0
</pre></div><p>
The init() function does the initial setup for the iptables
environment. First, we flush, or remove, all of the rules and user
chains. Then, we clear all of the rule counters. Later on, these counters
will allow us to determine how many packets were caught by each rule in
our firewall. Then, the script sets up the IP masquerading. I also put
in a rule that allows traffic that is related to an already established
connection to pass through the firewall without further evaluation. This
keeps the entire rule set from having to be evaluated for each incoming
packet. The rules apply only to each new connection request.
</p><p>
The set_default_policy() function configures how we treat network
traffic in the absence of any other firewall rules. In this case,
I'm interested only in policing incoming traffic; the policy accepts
outbound traffic and traffic that the kernel has to route to its
final destination. Trivial modifications to this script would allow
you to configure policies for each direction. By default, my script
denies traffic and requires the administrator to list explicitly all
of the allowable traffic. This is the safest way to build a firewall,
as opposed to a firewall that allows traffic by default and relies on
the administrator to deny dangerous traffic specifically.
You can never
know in advance all of the dangerous traffic, so denying everything but
well-understood traffic is a good idea.
</p><p>
The add_good_hosts() function creates firewall rules that allow all
traffic from hosts or networks listed in the good_hosts.conf file. Note
that I don't tie these rules to any particular interface. Traffic from
whitelisted hosts or networks can come in on any interface. I usually
put an entry in this file for my workstation at my home office as well
as the network at work. This way, even if I make a silly mistake that
would have kept me from logging in to my router remotely, I can still
get in from work or my office workstation to undo the change. Of course,
this also assumes that my workstation and the network at work haven't been
compromised. Usually, the contents of this file are quite short indeed.

</pre></div><p>
Conversely, the add_bad_hosts() function creates firewall rules that
block all traffic from hosts or networks listed in the bad_hosts.conf
file. This function works almost exactly like the add_good_hosts()
function with one important difference. When traffic from a blacklisted
host comes to the router, the router will not only log this fact,
it will also include the comment from the bad_hosts.conf file in the
log. This way, I can look at my log file and see why a particular host
was blocked. A useful improvement to this function would be to have it
place the bad host rules in a separate chain and have that chain called
early on in the rule set. This would give you the ability to
add and delete hosts conveniently from this chain from an external program, perhaps
in response to entries in your server log files.

</pre></div><p>
The build_chains() function builds a series of firewall rule chains. I
build a separate chain for each combination of interface and protocol. For
example, if I had a Linux router with eth0, eth1, eth2 and eth3, I would
create chains for eth0-tcp, eth0-udp, eth1-tcp, eth1-udp and so on. Then, I
build the rules necessary to send the decision-making process down the
appropriate chain. What we end up with is a decision tree that determines
what to do with each packet entering the router. Unlike a linear list
of firewall rules, the decision tree prevents the kernel from having to
evaluate obviously irrelevant rules. For example, a TCP packet coming
in on the WAN interface will never be tested against the rules meant
for UDP packets on the Wi-Fi interface.
</p><p>
I haven't done any objective testing to see if this tree-pruning
actually makes a significant performance improvement. On the other
hand, once the program is written and debugged, it costs me nothing to
change the configuration files and have this decision tree generated
automatically. So even if it improves performance by only a small amount,
it adds so little to the program's complexity that I think it makes
sense to do it.
</p><p>
The add_rules() function is where most of the work is done. This function
reads the contents of ports.conf, which is shown in Listing 5. Before
we discuss the add_rules() function in detail, we should discuss the
format and content of the ports.conf file.
</p><p>
The ports.conf file contains one line for each firewall rule. Each
line contains three columns and an optional comment preceded by the #
character. The first column is the user-defined label for the interface
that the rule will be applied to. The second column is the protocol,
that is, tcp, udp or the special case, all. Using all for the
protocol creates a rule that allows all traffic on the interface in
question. Finally, we have the port number. For example, the first line
of the file creates a rule that allows SSH traffic to come in on the
wan interface.

You'll notice that I have a rule that allows all traffic on the lo,
or loopback, interface. This is important, because without this rule,
many programs break in ways that are hard to diagnose. You also may be
asking why I go to the effort of creating so many firewall rules for my
LAN interface, only to have an all at the end. I do this for several
reasons. The primary reason is that until my kids grow up and get on the
Internet, I trust the traffic on my local network. However, by having
rules for each service I run, I'm able to extract statistics about how
much traffic each service generates. Also, security is an iterative
process. Over time, I'll add rules that will further tighten my firewall;
eventually, I'll remove the final all from the policy.
</p><p>
Now, back to the add_rules() function. Even though this is the longest
function in the entire program, it's still not too hard to understand. The
sections of code that deal with tcp and udp rules simply create two rules
for each rule in the ports.conf file. One rule is tied to the destination
port number; the other rule is tied to the source port number. At first,
this may seem odd, because we are policing only inbound traffic. What we're
doing is making sure that both inbound and outbound connections are
allowed to pass. For example, a packet coming in on the WAN interface
with the destination port set to 80 corresponds to
an inbound connection to my Web server. On the other hand, an incoming
packet on my WAN interface with the source port set to
80 is coming from an outside Web server in response to a request that
came from inside my network.
</p><p>
The code that handles the all rules is a special case. In this case,
we create a rule on the given interface for each of the protocols. In
hindsight, this might be overly complex, but it has an interesting
side effect. If the router encounters a packet containing an unknown
protocol, such as IPSec, the firewall will fall back to its default policy
even though we've asked it to pass all traffic on this interface. So, in
a sense, &ldquo;all protocols&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;all known
protocols&rdquo;. I think
this is a good thing.
</p><p>
For what it's worth, the script will put firewall rules into the kernel
in roughly the same order that they appear in the ports.conf file. I
say roughly, because the rules will be put into the appropriate chain
depending on which interface and protocol they match against. But within
each chain, the rules will be executed in order.
</p><p>
The set_default_action() function creates rules that determine what
happens to packets that don't match any previous rules. This sounds
very similar to the purpose of the set_default_policy() function,
but there is a subtle difference. The set_default_policy() function
configures the default firewall policy, and the set_default_action()
function creates firewall rules that catch unmatched traffic before
the kernel falls back to the default policy, essentially capping each
chain. Once these rules match a packet, they create a log entry for the
packet, and then they implement whatever policy we want, in this case,
DROP. Once again, the log entries allow me to determine what traffic
is being dropped and why.
</p><p>
I'm not trying to tell you that this program is perfect, nor will it do
everything you want it to do. You might even find bugs in it. In fact,
by the time you read this article, I'll probably have made several
improvements to the script. As it is right now, the script isn't able to
configure any firewall policy for the ICMP protocol. It would be nice
to be able to allow outbound ping requests and deny incoming requests,
for example. It would also be useful to be able to configure firewall
policy for outgoing and routed traffic. And because I'm using VoIP,
I'm thinking of changing my script to allow me to configure Quality of
Service (QoS). If you come up with useful modifications to this script,
I'd like to hear about them.
</p><p>
But there you have it, such as it is. In less than 200 lines of Perl code,
I'm able to implement a quite flexible and efficient firewall policy
containing potentially hundreds of individual rules. At the same time,
making changes to my firewall policy is simple enough that even most
beginning Linux users can make correct changes.
