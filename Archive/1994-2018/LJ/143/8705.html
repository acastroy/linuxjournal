How to use stealth e-mail with dynamic DNS and a Treo 650 smart phone.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e5f298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Since the early days of e-mail, maintaining my own e-mail server was a
sort of indication of being in charge and staying technically fit. The
technology involved in a project like this usually includes components
that can be reused elsewhere and force one to stay abreast with commonly
used communications media.
</p><p>
In the beginning, it was a simple task of connecting a modem, finding
a community UUCP server, configuring modem dial-up, uucico and
Sendmail. This was sort of the Model T of e-mail. And, it usually included
configuration of a Usenet feed with C-News to collect the UUCP addresses
of all computers on the relatively small Internet at that time.
</p><p>
With the advent of the real Internet, the scenario is becoming more complex.
You have to overcome a number of obstacles created by people trying
to break in to your server, snoop the transmission of e-mail packets on
the wire and deal with those who want to send you tons of unwanted
e-mail. As if this were not enough, workplaces have become so secure that
it is sometimes impossible to access your personal e-mail server over
the Internet from work during the day.
</p><p>
I used to maintain a Linux server with a static IP on a DSL line running
DNS, a firewall (netfilter) with my MTA of choice (Postfix) and the
addition of SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I read e-mail on my laptop
using IMAP with Netscape Communicator. I use Communicator filters to
sort all my incoming mail into various IMAP folders.
</p><p>
This simplistic architecture became history this summer after moving out
of the San Francisco Bay Area to Denver, Colorado. The luxury of a static-IP
DSL vendor disappeared, and a Nazi-style ISP with a monopoly in the area
became a reality. Static IP is not available here (at least for me), and the
ISP uses aggressive filtering of the commonly used IP ports. My new
workplace is so secure that I had forgotten about carrying my laptop with me
or using my work Internet connection to get to my e-mail server. All this is
understandable, as ISPs protect themselves from spammers and employers
need better security. But, I still want to read my e-mail during the day.
</p><p>
I took it as a personal challenge to overcome these obstacles. The
direction I went was to use the smart phone Treo 650 as a personal e-mail
reader to bypass the workplace security. I configured my home e-mail
server to use new stealth-mode ISPs that allow for dynamic DNS and mail
relays to ports of choice.
</p><p>
Here is a summary of the configuration components that I cover in
step-by-step configuration details below:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The e-mail server is running stable Gentoo Linux connected to the Internet
via VDSL (very high-speed DSL from Qwest), using DHCP-assigned dynamic-IP address. My DNS domain registrar is No-IP.com. This registrar uses a
custom dynamic DNS setup that detects IP address changes on my side. This
is done by running a custom client program on my server&mdash;noip2 client
connects to the No-IP.com registrar DNS server and updates my DNS records
in as often as one-minute intervals. This is called Plus Managed DNS.
</p></li><li><p>
Because my ISP blocks incoming IP port 25, I use the Mail Reflector
No-IP.com service that sets an MX record for my domain to its own server
and delivers the mail to a custom port on my server.
</p></li><li><p>
My ISP also lists my DHCP addresses with the Internet spam blacklists,
so any attempt to deliver e-mail directly from my server is doomed to
failure. To overcome this, I use the No-IP.com service called Alternate-Port
SMTP, which acts as an outgoing mail relay. I punt all mail to a No-IP.com
server using SSL authentication and also a custom port in case my ISP
blocks outgoing SMTP.
</p></li><li><p>
My MTA is Postfix, which is quite handy for the stealth configuration
with alternate incoming and outgoing ports.
</p></li><li><p>
I use SpamAssassin to filter spam. It is easy to configure and works
very well. In brief, its function is limited to processing mail messages
and attaching a custom mail header field&mdash;an X-Spam-Level rating to each message
as spam candidates. The level of spam likelihood is measured by the number
of asterisks this field contains. A single * is usually a good indication
of spam.
</p></li><li><p>
I could not count on storing e-mail on my smart phone and filtering it
there. The phone couldn't handle that much e-mail. So I replaced the
client-side Netscape Communicator filter function (to sort incoming
mail into IMAP folders) with Procmail. I created a .procmailrc file
implementing all spam and mailing-list rules to file messages in the
folder hierarchy on the server. This proved to be quite useful and opened
the access to my archived e-mail from any location.
</p></li><li><p>
The IMAP server was quite a problem for me. I prefer traditional mailboxes
where multiple messages are stored in a single file per folder. Most
modern IMAP servers, like Courier or Cyrus, use modern maildir or MH
formats, which store each message in its own file. This consumes an insane
amount of i-nodes. Unfortunately, the only open-source IMAP server I
could find that uses traditional folders is the uw-imap. (CommuniGate
Pro uses single files, but it's a commercial server.) The uw-imap server
has a number of drawbacks, especially when it comes to SSL-protocol
implementation. My tests of uw-imap with the SSL IMAP client that I had in
mind for this project (PalmOS VersaMail) showed failed connections or flat
failures to connect. To get what I want&mdash;the single file mail folders
and working SSL&mdash;I split the function of IMAP and SSL over two separate
servers: stunnel and uw-imap. Stunnel proved to be quite sophisticated
in the SSL configuration and level of logging and diagnostic messages.
</p></li><li><p>
The client side of my e-mail configuration originally included stock
PalmOS VersaMail shipped with the Treo 650 and part of a Sprint plan. The key
factor in this decision was availability of unlimited use of Internet
connectivity for a flat $15 US per month fee. The VersaMail IMAP support is
quite good, and integration with the Blazer Web browser made the sale for
me. Unfortunately, a more-intense use of the VersaMail uncovered problems
with its operation. The whole setup depends on a reliable mail server
polling for new mail. Unfortunately, VersaMail has a bug that impacts
scheduling of the polling, and this makes it rather ineffective. I
ended up using the SnapperMail mail client for PalmOS, which is a good
example of how nine guys in New Zealand can outrun a big corporation like Palm
Software. SnapperMail is one of the best PalmOS applications I have used
so far.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are quite a number of moving parts here, and a diagram is in order
(Figure 1).

Figure 1. The Layout of the Complete E-Mail Solution
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see from Figure 1, there are three main areas of configuration:
Linux server, No-IP.com services and the Treo 650 mail client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e5fdf0"></a>
Linux Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
My selection of the Gentoo Linux distribution for the project was dictated
by the very convenient Portage package management. Portage completely frees
the user from hunting down required packages. In operation, it resembles
Perl CPAN or Debian apt-get. For installation of Gentoo itself, refer to
the gentoo.org Web site. The installation of the OS is mostly manual,
and it can be a rather lengthy process (some installations even can take
days, because you compile everything yourself), but this investment will
pay itself back during server management and application configuration.
</p><p>
You also need to get the DNS and SMTP services from No-IP.com, mentioned
above. The No-IP.com Web site provides documentation for all services
they provide.
</p><p>
The instructions that follow are Gentoo-specific, but it should be
fairly easy to adapt this project to a different distribution. You simply
need to make sure that the applications you install have the capabilities
(like SASL) used for this solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e5ffa8"></a>
Postfix MTA</h2></div></div><p>
We begin installation with the core component, Postfix. Standard
Gentoo installation comes with a simple MTA ssmtp that needs to be
removed before Postfix installation. Also, Postfix needs to be installed
(compiled) with SASL support. This is needed for authenticated mail
delivery to the No-IP.com relay host (Alternate-Port SMTP service).
</p><p>
The SASL option is turned on with the sasl keyword added to the Gentoo USE
configuration variable. In /etc/make.conf, add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/make.conf:

USE="sasl"
</pre>
</p><p>
Install SASL libraries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# emerge dev-libs/cyrus-sasl
</pre>
</p><p>
Now remove and add MTAs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# emerge -C ssmtp
# emerge postfix
</pre>
</p><p>
Add init rc script startup:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rc-update add postfix default
</pre>
</p><p>
Postfix configuration is relatively simple&mdash;two configuration files in
/etc/postfix need attention: main.cf and master.cf.
</p><p>
Change the information describing your gateway host by editing the main.cf
file for Postfix. Here, the hostname of your gateway is mygateway,
and the domain name is foobar.net. The relay host that you will send all your
mail to is relayhost.no-ip.com, receiving SMTP on port 1234. Both will
be provided by No-IP.com as part of the Alternate-Port SMTP service:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myhostname = mygateway
mydomain = foobar.net
myorigin = $mydomain
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain $mydomain
#home_mailbox = .maildir/
relayhost = relayhost.no-ip.com:1234
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/saslpass
smtp_sasl_security_options =
</pre>
</p><p>
Add an extra port (4321) beside 25 to the Postfix master.cf file.
This will be used to receive SMTP from the Mail Reflector No-IP.com service
and also your Treo 650:

<pre     class="programlisting">
4321      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
</pre>
</p><p>
Create an SASL password file /etc/postfix/saslpass for host
relayhost.no-ip.com and user foobar.net@noip-smtp using password
????&mdash;all provided by No-IP.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/postfix/saslpass:

relayhost.no-ip.com     foobar.net@noip-smtp:????
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, generate a dbm map:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/postfix
# postmap saslpass
</pre>
</p><p>
As a final touch, you need to enable e-mail relaying from your Treo 650. We
use Sprint here, and you will have to find out what Sprint switch IP
range will be connecting to your server. The Postfix main.cf parameter
mynetworks will have to include the network address of the switch. I
use 70.0.0.0/8 beside my home network and a local loop network. It is
always best to narrow the range of addresses as much as possible, for
security reasons:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mynetworks = 192.168.1.0/24 127.0.0.0/8 70.0.0.0/8
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e60738"></a>
Spam Filter</h2></div></div><p>
You need to install two packages: spamassassin and procmail.
The steps (for Gentoo) are as follows.
</p><p>
Install Procmail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# emerge procmail
</pre>
</p><p>
Install SpamAssassin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# emerge spamassassin
</pre>
</p><p>
Update the init rc scripts to start the SpamAssassin server (this is probably
done for you if you use a different package manager):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rc-update add spamd default
</pre>
</p><p>
Adjust your Postfix configuration to deliver all mail using Procmail.
Add this to /etc/postfix/main.cf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the main Procmail configuration file /etc/procmailrc, and add this
recipe to make e-mail pass through SpamAssassin:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DEFAULT=/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME
:0fw: spamassassin.lock
* &lt; 256000
| /usr/bin/spamc

</pre>
</p><p>
Start the spamd server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/init.d/spamd start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e60c60"></a>
Mail Filing</h2></div></div><p>
Establish an IMAP folder hierarchy and Procmail configuration file to
file mail in those folders. If you have multiple users, you have
to do this for each user. The following configuration uses ~/.m for
the folder root directory. The per-user Procmail configuration file is
located in ~/.prcmailrc. I use the following .procmailrc file template
that implements the essential functionality of separating spam from mail
and filing mailing lists. For details, refer to procmailrc(5):

<pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
MAILDIR=$HOME/.m
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/Mbox
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail.log
VERBOSE=yes

# File gentoo-user mailing list into ~/.m/lst/gentoo
:O:
* (^To.*|^Cc.*)gentoo-user@lists.gentoo.org
lst/gentoo

# File jobserve mail into ~/.m/lst/jobserve
:O:
* ^From.*jobserve.com
lst/jobserve

# File SPAM into ~/.m/Spam with some exceptions:
:O:
* ^X-Spam-Level:.*\*
 * !^From.*netflix
 * !^From.*vail
 * !^From.*ebay member
 * !^From.*cnet
Spam

# File SPAM that escaped spamassassin:
:O
* ^From.*eversave.com
Spam
:O:
* ^From.*sears.com
Spam
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that the mail processing facilities are in place, you can start Postfix
and let the mail start flowing in; I can almost guarantee that the first
folder with mail will be your ~/.m/Spam:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/init.d/postfix start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e57700"></a>
IMAP Server</h2></div></div><p>
The IMAP configuration includes a stunnel SSL front end and the uw-imap
back end. The installation for uw-imap is a bit nonstandard, because the
default Gentoo configuration does not allow you to build uw-imap with
clear-text authentication over an unencrypted channel. The only default
uw-imap configuration that works is the one with SSL support. This is
not what we need as a server behind stunnel. Gentoo lets you remedy this
with a special USE setting to disable SSL and enable clear-text passwords.
</p><p>
The installation command for Gentoo is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# USE="-ssl clearpasswd" emerge uw-imap
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, the stunnel configuration file stunnel.conf needs to include an
IMAP section. Edit /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pid = /var/run/stunnel/stunnel.pid
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
cert = /etc/ssl/certs/foobar.net.pem
[imaps]
accept  = 993
exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
execargs = imapd
</pre>
</p><p>
You can generate a self-signed SSL certificate for foobar.net.pem with
the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/ssl/certs
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cacert.pem -keyout cakey.pem -days 5000
        Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
        State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CO
        Locality Name (eg, city) []:Highlands Ranch
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:home
        Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:foobar.net
        Email Address []:me@foobar.net

# cat cakey.pem cacert.pem &gt; foobar.net.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
With Gentoo, you must now configure the init rc scripts to start stunnel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rc-update add stunnel default
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e57ac8"></a>
The Treo 650 Setup</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned, there are two good IMAP clients available for PalmOS. One
is the standard application included with the Treo, VersaMail. The other
is a commercial application, SnapperMail. My choice was the latter, even
in spite of its relatively high cost (approximately $60 US).
</p><p>
Both applications allow for subscribing to a hierarchy of IMAP folders on
the server and handling e-mail attachments. SnapperMail is definitely
better tested and has a number of features that justify its additional
cost.
</p><p>
To install PalmOS applications and generally manage my Treo 650 using
Linux, I use pilot-link software. On Gentoo, install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# emerge pilot-link
</pre>
</p><p>
I use pilot-link to back up and restore my Treo to a directory on Linux
as well as to install applications like SnapperMail.
</p><p>
I use Bluetooth and PPP to connect my Treo to a Linux notebook. You
also can use a USB connection. The connection channel for pilot-link tools
is conveniently defined with a PILOTPORT environment variable. Use the
following for a USB cable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# export PILOTPORT=/dev/tts/USB1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d67580.0x1e57de0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or for Bluetooth, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# export PILOTPORT=net:any
</pre>
</p><p>
I create a directory named treo in my home directory, and run this command
to back up my Treo before installing any software:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pilot-xfer -b treo
</pre>
</p><p>
I use the following command to synchronize (incrementally) the Treo with
this backup directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pilot-xfer -s treo
</pre>
</p><p>
To restore a backup, use the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pilot-xfer -r treo
</pre>
</p><p>
Download SME231.zip from <a href="http://www.snappermail.com" target="_self">www.snappermail.com</a> to install the
SnapperMail application. Unzip the file and run this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pilot-xfer -i SnapperMail-ent.prc
</pre>
</p><p>
The configuration of the Treo 650 with the Sprint network is best done
by ordering the Sprint PCS Vision Professional Pack and letting Sprint
support walk you through the setup.
</p><p>
SnapperMail also comes with a good 60-page PDF manual, and its setup
is really quite intuitive.
