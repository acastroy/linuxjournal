<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #143, March 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

A new cryptographic filesystem, <span   class="bold"><b>eCryptFS</b></span>, has been sent to the kernel
developers for consideration. <span   class="bold"><b>Phillip
Hellewell</b></span> has been working with
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Halcrow</b></span>, who presented a detailed design of eCryptFS at the 2005
Ottowa Linux Symposium. eCryptFS may be &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; on top of other
filesystems, using the <span   class="bold"><b>FiST</b></span>-stackable
filesystem framework written by <span   class="bold"><b>Erez
Zadok</b></span>. The current version supports per-mount decryption only, essentially
to support testing and debugging of the basic features. Advanced policy and
per-file public key support is planned after some amount of testing can
be done on the existing infrastructure. One of the most interesting features
of eCryptFS is that it stores its cryptographic metadata within the files
themselves, allowing cool features like securely transferring files across
untrusted domains.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mark Gross</b></span> submitted a special character
driver for the <span   class="bold"><b>Intel NetStructure
MPCBL0010</b></span> single-board computer that will ship in the fall. The MPCBL0010 is
essentially intended for use in telecom devices, which often need to
synchronize their operations with other hardware. Mark's driver enables this
synchronization via the onboard FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
intended for that purpose. And, a sysfs interface provides
easy control over this synchronization to the system developer. Mark also
included an ioctl interface, primarily so the driver could be tested under
2.4 kernels, but the ioctl probably will be dropped in any final version of
the patch accepted into the 2.6 tree.
</p><p>
The saga of <span   class="bold"><b>software suspend</b></span> continues
to be broad and sweeping. <span   class="bold"><b>Rafael J.
Wysocki</b></span> recently posted some patches to split the entire
<span   class="bold"><b>swsusp</b></span>
infrastructure into two independent kernel subsystems. One subsystem is
responsible for snapshotting the running system, and the other is
responsible for reading and writing the snapshotted data to and from swap.
One of the benefits of this division is that it allows a significant portion
of swsusp's functioning eventually to be migrated to user-space. Aside from
that, the new system allows more memory efficiency, and it does away with
certain size limitations and reliance on global variables. <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span>
also has gone over these patches and approved them. As we watch big changes like
code forks, reunifications, subsystem divisions and so on, it's important
to remember that in the beginning, software suspend was deemed impossible
because certain hardware state just couldn't be saved. It's no surprise that
this feature's problems remain large.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> revision control system continues to develop at a hot pace. If you
haven't tried it, you should. The <span   class="bold"><b>Ubuntu</b></span> distribution's kernel development
is now done with git, and <span   class="bold"><b>ethtool</b></span> development recently migrated to git as
well. As a side point, it was pointed out recently to <span   class="bold"><b>Randal L. Schwartz</b></span>
(now using git for Web site development) that git is binary-safe and easily
handles image files, compressed tarballs and anything else one might throw
at it. Other folks, like <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span>, have been experimenting with creating a
peer-to-peer storage back end for git, allowing users to query a larger git
network, rather than a single standalone system. File renaming in git
continues to be a hard sell from <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>, as he insists that rename
tracking can be done automatically and does not require the user informing
the system of a rename. Although no longer the primary git maintainer, Linus
continues to influence development strongly, and he remains the biggest
evangelist of git features, often pointing out powerful and non-obvious
idioms to mailing-list readers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has taken over from
<span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span> as the <span   class="bold"><b>Trivial Patch Monkey</b></span> maintainer. As created by Rusty, the Trivial Patch Monkey collects and
submits patches that are so trivial they could not possibly be wrong.
Originally, many such trivial patches would get lost in the shuffle.
Contributors wouldn't know precisely where to submit them, and the
developers who might receive them (including Linus Torvalds) often just let
them drop on the floor, choosing instead to focus on more significant work.
Rusty decided to pick up these patches and submit them regularly until they
finally would be accepted. With each kernel release, he would initiate the
semi-automated process of sending these patches along, with the form and
timing most likely to appeal to Linus. Now Rusty has apparently moved on,
and Adrian will perform a similar task. The Trivial Patch Monkey is not
unlike the new w.x.y.z stable tree (dubbed the sucker tree by Linus). Both
are largely thankless tasks that lack the thrill of participating in new
feature development. And, both make a large difference to the community,
though we don't spend much time thinking about them.

<h2 class="title">Edubuntucation</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #143, March 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

I knew Ubuntu (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.org" target="_self">www.ubuntu.org</a>) had reached a milestone when my
friend John, a Windows expert of long standing, told me he now tests
hardware combinations with Ubuntu. &ldquo;When I loaded XP on this new box I
put together yesterday, it was a nightmare. It couldn't find
peripherals, wouldn't load all kinds of stuff. Then I booted it with
Ubuntu and it found everything, just like that. So I knew the machine
and the peripherals were fine.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But what's good for experts like John still might not be simple and easy
enough for schools. That's why we now have Edubuntu
(<a href="http://www.edubuntu.org" target="_self">www.edubuntu.org</a>), a new Ubuntu distro that's customized for
classroom use. Says the edubuntu.org Wiki, &ldquo;As an educator, you'll be
able to set up a computer lab or establish an on-line learning
environment, in an hour or less&mdash;then administer that environment
without having to become a fully-fledged Linux geek.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Edubuntu is built on the 2.6 Linux kernel and GNOME 2.12. It contains
more than 16,000 pieces of software and fits on a bootable CD. It is
also pointedly noncommercial. The Edubuntu Manifesto begins, &ldquo;Edubuntu
will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the
'enterprise edition'. We make our very best work available to everyone
on the same Free terms.&rdquo; The Manifesto also commits to a regular and
predicable six-month release schedule interval. The first official
release of Edubuntu 5.10 came out on October 13, 2005. The next
release should then be due in April of this year.

<h2 class="title">The Edge at Micro Centers</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #143, March 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Micro Center is a chain of 19 computer gear stores in 13
states. You find them where techies are concentrated: Santa Clara,
Tustin, Madison, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Cambridge and Fairfax. You find
them on-line too at <a href="http://microcenter.com" target="_self">microcenter.com</a>.
</p><p>
If you go into their stores, you now find desktop Linux doing something
more than bringing down the price of some bottom-end Windows-less PC.
Desktop Linux is actually featured. Or, in retail lingo, merchandised.
</p><p>
When the decision to promote desktop Linux was made, Kevin Jones, VP of
Merchandising for Micro Center, sent out a letter that said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We know we
can't just randomly plunk new desktop Linux computers around our vast
stores and expect them to sell well. To become viable, a product line
has to be prominently displayed, easy to test drive, and be
backed by both a knowledgeable salesperson and post-sale service and
support. Micro Center's retail model is based on the &ldquo;store within a
store&rdquo; concept&mdash;products are housed in their own separate sections
within the store, where trained Micro Center staff can respond to
questions about the specific products in their sections.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This progress isn't limited to the chain's off-line stores. A search for
&ldquo;linux&rdquo; at <a href="http://microcenter.com" target="_self">microcenter.com</a> brings up
13 pages of results. And, if
you want to know one reason why the on-line store performs so well, go do
&ldquo;What's this site running?&rdquo; at Netcraft.
</p><p>
Eleven servers come up, all running Linux.

Are you still writing programs with the same tools and in the same
manner as you did five, seven or even ten years ago? Thinking it might be time
to modernize your programming arsenal? Follow along as Collin Park takes
a step away from 20+ years of C coding and ventures into Python waters.
In his new series on <i  >LJ</i>.com, Collin tests out Python by putting it to
work solving various puzzles, including the &ldquo;Coconuts&rdquo; problem
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8728" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8728</a>) and Sudoku
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8729" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8729</a>).
</p><p>
Exclusively for <i  >LJ</i>.com readers, read an excerpt from Chapter 10, &ldquo;Adding
Your Code to the Kernel&rdquo;, of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Kernel Primer: A Top-Down
Approach for x86 and PowerPC Architectures</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/8730" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/8730</a>). In our excerpt, authors
Claudia Salzberg Rodriguez, Gordon Fischer and Steven Smolski &ldquo;follow a device
driver from how the device is represented in the filesystem...through the
specific kernel code that controls it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Finally, graduate student Ryan Mauer shares the results of his recent
project on Xen. Ryan is a student of our regular <i  >LJ</i>.com contributor
Professor Richard Sevenich at Eastern Washington University. Ryan
intended his project to be &ldquo;an example of how Xen Virtualization
can be utilized to prototype a Linux cluster with only a single physical
computer, thereby minimizing the up-front hardware costs, as well as
providing a way to perform a feasibility study early in the cluster
implementation process.&rdquo; Read the article and learn the results of his
work.
