Bash a little time away with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x247a580.0x2572450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We've spent the last three columns talking about the basic nuts and bolts
of shell script programming,
so I think it's time to start digging into a real shell script,
and build something interesting and useful. Well, interesting, at least!
</p><p>
What I would like to do&mdash;and up front I admit that this might be a
crazy hard problem for a shell script&mdash;is to try to write a rudimentary
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game. It's simple enough that it should be manageable, but
it's hard enough that we'll really have to flex our scripting muscle to get
everything working. Needless to say, it won't have a fancy graphical
interface!

Onward to Vegas</h2></div></div><p>
We'll go into the specific rules of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> as needed, but for now all
you need to know about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> is that each player gets two cards from a
deck of standard playing cards, and that players can then request additional
cards, trying to get their point total as close to 21 as possible, without
going over that value. All face cards are worth 10 points each, and an
Ace is worth 1 or 11, depending on how the player wants it to count.
</p><p>
The first challenge is to create a virtual deck of cards, but this is
easier than you might think, because it can be represented simply by an
array of 52 elements, with the first 13 representing one suit,
the second 13 a second suit and so forth. So, card #37 might be a Jack of
Hearts, for example.
</p><p>
It turns out that shell scripts can use arrays, so let's start by creating
a 52-element array and populating it with the values 1&ndash;52:

<pre     class="programlisting">
card=1
while [ $card -lt 53 ]
do
  deck[$card]=$card
  card=$(( $card + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're used to Perl, you might be thinking that a for loop would be
a more logical choice for this sort of task, but for loops in shell
scripts lack the ability to step through a range of values.
Arrays in the Bourne Shell are easy to work with: simply specify a reference
index and the array will be grown to that size dynamically.
</p><p>
Now we have a representation of a deck of cards, but it's perfectly
sorted, so the next step is to write some code that will shuffle
the deck. This proves to be a bit more tricky, as you might expect!
</p><p>
The basic idea is that we'll randomly pick a number between 1 and 52,
and then see if its card is available or not. So the initial deck we created
that's sorted is used as the source for the shuffled deck, which will
actually end up in a new array. Here's the basic piece of code for the
random card selection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while [ $errcount -lt $threshold ]
 do
   randomcard=$(( ( $RANDOM % 52 ) + 1 ))
   errcount=$(( $errcount + 1 ))

   if [ ${deck[$randomcard]} -ne 0 ] ; then
     picked=${deck[$randomcard]}
     deck[$picked]=0         # picked, remove it
     return $picked
   fi
 done
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a lot to see here, but let's talk about the basic logic first:
although we're going to pick a card randomly between 1 and 52, and then see
if it has already been picked, we also need to make sure we don't end
up trapped in an infinite loop because of a mediocre random number
function. That's managed by keeping track of the number of guesses you have
to make with the variable errcount. The threshold can be adjusted
to allow more or fewer guesses for each card. I have it set to 10 as a
default value.
</p><p>
You can see that working with arrays makes variable references quite
a bit more tricky. Setting the value isn't too bad, as shown earlier,
but referencing the array requires the addition of curly braces, so the
reference to <tt  >${deck[$randomcard]}</tt> is to the randomcard slot in the
array deck.
</p><p>
Otherwise, don't let all the notation distract you as this is a fairly
straightforward loop. Try <span   class="emphasis"><em>threshold</em></span> times to pick a card
randomly out of the array <span   class="emphasis"><em>deck</em></span> that hasn't already
been chosen (for example, had its
value set to zero rather than the initialized value).
</p><p>
The other interesting piece of this code block is the RANDOM
variable. Every time you reference $RANDOM, you get a different number
between zero and MAXINT (a very large integer value), automatically,
without having to initialize anything or do any special work. Try it
yourself by typing <tt  >echo $RANDOM</tt> at the Bourne Again Shell command
prompt.
</p><p>
This isn't the full code segment, because we also need to have a
fall-through, a block of code that is used when the random guesses don't
produce a desired card and we instead need to step through the
array deck linearly to find one that's available. Typically, it'd be used
only at the very end of the shuffle when there are only a few cards left. This
code looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
randomcard=1

while [ ${deck[$randomcard]} -eq 0 ]
do
   randomcard=$(( $randomcard + 1 ))
done

picked=$randomcard
deck[$picked]=0             # picked, remove it
return $picked
</pre>
</p><p>
This should be even easier to read now that you're becoming familiar
with arrays.
</p><p>
I'm going to stop here for this month, and we'll pick up the card shuffling
task again next month, including an explanation of how to make it a
shell function and utilize it in the main game script itself. Stay tuned!
