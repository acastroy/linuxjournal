director&rdquo;. Understandably since you have a layout person doing the
work that an art director should your requests for an opinion is a
cry for help.</p><p>Judging from the recent changes this cry of help seems
justified. Your magazine was brought to my attention by my husband,
one of your subscribers. His response was, &ldquo;Look how amateurish
this is.&rdquo;</p><p>I would like to start with the visual on page 19. This is a
bad shot. It may have been the only one that you had. Why wasn't it
cropped differently or the background replaced? Did Amy like the
hair sticking out and the UFO by his right shoulder?</p><p>The lime green? Was it inspired by the well designed ad on
page 29? Do you feel it works as well as on page 6 &amp; 7? Was the
Linux color on page 3 chosen from the ad on page 59? Do you feel
the two colors complement each other well on page 3?</p><p>In newspapers rough sketches lend well to the 80 line
screens. In magazines as in your case the rough thumbnail sketches
appear badly drawn and quite wobbly. Are you trying to give the
impression that your magazine can not afford an illustrator?</p><p>Page 10. Why is 'Stop the Presses' so big? Is it to compete
with the even larger horsey Headlines throughout your magazine?
Doesn't by Phil Hughes look so small in comparison floating in all
that white space. It gets a bit lost just hanging there. Shouldn't
the three be married in a design unity? Stop the presses? (see page
116 of June Wired Magazine)</p><p>Why is the logo of your Magazine treated differently between
the cover and page 3? Why is the date under Journal? Was the page
intended to be smaller or did Amy feel the white space and the line
added something? Why is the XBase lines so big on the cover? Do you
feel that the cover breaths well of is it a clutter on design
elements thrown on the page to fill up all space?</p><p>My suggestion is send Amy on a Design course or two. Perhaps
if she didn't race through the design she may have done a better
job. But remember you get what you pay for.  &mdash;Most
