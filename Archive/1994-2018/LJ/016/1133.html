    Memory allocation of some sort is required in practically
    any program, but in the Linux kernel it is more complex than
    in user-lever code&mdash;for good reason.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b704a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Memory allocation in the Linux kernel is
complex, because there are significant constraints involved&mdash;and
different ways of allocating memory have different constraints.
This means that anyone writing Linux kernel code needs to
understand the various ways of allocating memory, including the
tradeoffs involved. This makes for for more efficient use of memory
and CPU time&mdash;you can specify exactly what you need&mdash;but it also
makes for more demanding programming.
</p><p>There are essentially five different ways of allocating
memory in the kernel. That's a white lie, but it is close enough to
the truth for anyone who needs to read this article to learn about
kernel memory allocation. Three (which provide dynamic allocation)
are generally useful, and two (which provide static allocation) are
deprecated, and are mostly historical artifacts that should not be
used. We will discuss the advantages and limitations of the useful
ways first, and will only briefly mention the two deprecated ways
at the end of this article so that you know what to avoid.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b70608"></a>Memory Allocation Strategies</h2></div></div><p>There are a few rules that apply no matter what form of
dynamic kernel memory allocation you attempt to do. Whenever you
attempt to allocate memory in kernel space, you
<span   class="bold"><b>must</b></span> be prepared for an allocation
error. Always check the value returned from the allocation
function, and if it is 0, you will need to handle it cleanly,
somehow. User-space code can be terminated with a segmentation
violation if it ignores memory allocation errors, but the kernel
can easily crash, bringing down the whole system.</p><p>There are several common error-handling strategies. One
strategy is to attempt to allocate critical memory at the top of a
function, where you are less likely to have committed yourself and
can more likely return an error cleanly. This is usually the best
way to handle the problem.</p><p>Another strategy, usually used together with allocation at
the top of the function, is to allocate an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; amount of memory
for the memory management system to provide, and then parcel it out
for various purposes during the life of the function, effectively
doing its own memory management. Several subsystems in the kernel
do this, such as the high-level SCSI drivers and the network code.
Both include special memory allocation functions which are only
supposed to be used in those subsystem. These are not documented
here, under the assumption that documentation for those subsystems
should document subsystem-specific memory allocation
routines.</p><p>Yet another strategy, which will only work if you are not in
&ldquo;critical&rdquo; sections of code, is to allow the kernel to schedule
another process by calling <b  >schedule()</b> and then
to try again later, when schedule returns. Note that some kinds of
allocation are not safe to call even once from within critical
code; that will be covered when we discuss the individual
functions.</p><p>The fundamental rule is not to write algorithms that commit
themselves to completing without having been guaranteed the
resources they need in order to complete. Memory is one of the
scarcest and most commonly needed of the resources that must be
guaranteed, and the only way to guarantee that memory will be
available is to allocate it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b70920"></a>Kmalloc</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >kmalloc()</b> function allocates memory at
two levels: it uses a &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; system to allocate memory in units
up to nearly a page (4Kb on the i86) in length, and uses a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo;
system on lists of different sizes of contiguous chunks of memory
to allocate memory in units up to 128Kb (on the i86) in length.
Only in recent kernels has it been able to allocate memory in units
over 4Kb in length, and allocating large amounts of memory with
kmalloc is very likely to fail, especially in low-memory
situations, and especially on machines with less memory.</p><p>Kmalloc is very flexible, as demonstrated by its calling
convention:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void * kmalloc(unsigned int size, int priority);
</pre><p>Note the <b  >priority</b> argument: this is what
makes kmalloc so flexible; it is possible to use kmalloc in very
constrained circumstances such as from an interrupt handler.
Interrupt-driven code, or code that cannot be pre-empted, but still
needs to allocate memory, can call kmalloc with the
<b  >GFP_ATOMIC</b> priority. This will be more likely to
fail, because it cannot swap or do anything else which would cause
implicit or explicit I/O to occur. Code with relaxed requirements,
which may legitimately be pre-empted, should instead call kmalloc
with the <b  >GFP_KERNEL</b> priority. This may cause
paging and may cause <b  >schedule()</b> to be called,
but has a higher chance of success.
</p><p>In order to dynamically allocate memory that can by accessed
via DMA, the <b  >GFP_DMA</b> priority should be used. It
does stress the memory system, particularily if large amounts of
memory are requested, and is quite likely to fail. Try again. It
should be noted that <b  >GFP_DMA</b> is only likely to
fail on system with severe limitations on DMA transfers&mdash;such as
computers using the common ISA bus. Not all platforms are affected
by this problem.</p><p>Memory allocated with <b  >kmalloc()</b> is freed
with <b  >kfree()</b> (or
<b  >kfree_s()</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b70f50"></a>Vmalloc</h2></div></div><p>For allocating large areas of virtually contiguous memory
that do not have to be physically contiguous for interfacing with
hardware, the new <b  >vmalloc()</b> function (with the
same calling convention as conventional
<b  >malloc()</b>) will cause less stress on the memory
subsystem. It allocates possibly non-contiguous blocks of free
memory, and maps them into one contiguous space in high memory. It
is less likely to fail than kmalloc in many situations. It does not
take a priority like kamlloc does. It cannot be called from within
an interrupt, and it may implicitly cause pre-emption to
occur.</p><p>Memory allocated with vmalloc is not DMA-able, even on
systems without DMA restrictions, because DMA under Linux assumes a
1-1 logical-physical page mapping. This simplifies memory
management in several ways, and is not a severe restriction,
because kmalloc provides a way to get DMA-capable memory.</p><p>Just because it is addressed virtually does not mean that
this memory is subject to paging to disk, despite rumors to the
contrary. The &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; in vmalloc refers only to the addressing,
which is not a 1-1 mapping from virtual to physical address space,
unlike the rest of the kernel. Swapping may be initiated to
<span   class="bold"><b>provide</b></span> the memory during a call
to <b  >vmalloc()</b>, but the vmalloced memory will not
then be swapped out.</p><p>Memory allocated with <b  >vmalloc()</b> is freed
with <b  >vfree()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b71370"></a>get_free_pages</h2></div></div><p>Now we learn what the <b  >GFP</b> above stands
for: <b  >get_free_page</b> (well, perhaps
<b  >__get_free_pages</b>) and simply specifies how
exactly this function goes about attempting to find free pages of
memory. As you may guess, the same <b  >GFP_*</b> values
are used for these functions as well.</p><p>This is the way to request an amount of memory that is easy
for the memory subsystem to allocate. This is the lowest-level&mdash;and
therefore the lowest-overhead&mdash;way of dynamicly allocating memory.
If you need a chunk of memory larger than half a page but no larger
than a page (when deciding this, be aware that page size varies
from architecture to architecture; it is 4Kb on the i86 and 8Kb on
the DEC Alpha, for instance), especially if you only need it for
the duration of the current procedure, this can be the right way to
go. Also, if you are working on subsystem-specific memory
management, you almost certainly want to allocate your memory this
way.</p><p>If you want only one page, call
<b  >get_free_page(<i><tt>priority</tt></i>)</b>,
where <b  ><i><tt>priority</tt></i></b> is one
of the <b  >GFP_*</b> values. Of course, the same rules
about which <b  >GFP_*</b> value is correct apply as for
kmalloc. If you only want one page and don't care if it has been
cleared (set to all zero values), use
<b  >__get_free_page(<i><tt>priority</tt></i>)</b>
instead, since most of the overhead of allocating a page with
<b  >get_free_page</b> goes to clearing the page.</p><p>If you need to allocate more than one consecutive page, you
can do so, although this is more likely to fail than allocating a
single page, and the more pages you wish to allocate, the less
likely you are to succeed. You can only allocate a number of pages
which is a power of two.
<b  >__get_free_pages(<i><tt>priority</tt></i>,
<i><tt>order</tt></i>)</b> is called with the same
<b  ><i><tt>priority</tt></i></b> argument;
the <b  ><i><tt>order</tt></i></b> argument
gives the size according to the following formula:
<b  >PAGE_SIZE</b>&lt;\!s&gt;*&lt;\!s&gt;2&lt;+&gt;<b  ><i><tt>order</tt></i></b>&lt;+&gt;
so an <b  ><i><tt>order</tt></i></b> of 0
gives one page, of 1 gives two pages, of 2 gives four pages, and so
on (in current kernels, at least) up to 5, which gives 32 pages,
which on the i86 architecture is 128Kb.
<b  >PAGE_SIZE</b>, as you may have guessed, is the
standard macro for the number of bytes in a page.</p><p>The <b  >__get_dma_pages()</b> function works
exactly like <b  >__get_free_pages()</b>, except that it
allocates pages which are capable of being used for DMA, and it
puts more stress on the memory allocation system.</p><p>Pages allocated with <b  >get_free_page()</b> or
<b  >__get_free_page()</b> are freed with
<b  >free_page()</b>, and pages allocated with
<b  >__get_free_pages()</b> and
<b  >__get_dma_pages()</b> are freed with
<b  >free_pages()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b68a70"></a>Device initialization</h2></div></div><p>Now we approach the deprecated strategies. They may be useful
in some circumstances, mostly in situations where they are the
&ldquo;easy way&rdquo; to get a driver working. In those cases, it is usually
best to eventually find another way to do the same thing, as
neither strategy is very flexible. Neither strategy is applicable
to loadable modules.</p><p>When a device which is compiled into the kernel is
initialized, it is passed a pointer to available memory. It is then
required to return a pointer. If the pointer it returns is higher
than the pointer it got, the memory in between the two pointers is
reserved for the device. That memory will be in the first few
megabytes of memory. The exact location will depend on how the
kernel is booted. This is (perhaps unfortunately...) documented in
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>.</p><p>Once allocated, that memory cannot be freed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b68c80"></a>Memory initialization</h2></div></div><p>This particular method is extremely deprecated, and is
architecture-dependent as well. It is possible to add a function
call within the body of <b  >mem_init()</b>, which
resides, for the i86 platform, in the file arch/i386/mm/init.c. In
the middle of this function, two functions for initializing SCSI
and sound-driver memory are provided. Also, arch/i386/kernel/head.S
provides another platform-dependent way to allocate memory. This is
where initial memory management is set up.</p><p>If you understand these well enough to muck with them, you
don't need my help. These are last resorts for memory allocation,
and you need to know <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> what you need to
do, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> the dynamic allocation strategies
will not work for you, before considering these &ldquo;hacks&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
