    In this last of three articles on the World Wide Web, Eric
    discusses how to create interactive HTML forms, which allow
    you to collect data and interact with users as well as serve
    documents.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x104b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>You have set up a World Wide Web server,
and now have a number of HTML (hypertext markup language) documents
for web-surfing visitors to enjoy. You're comfortable with HTML,
and are ready to find new things for your server to do. In your
network travels, you remember filling out some electronic forms to
give feedback to the creator of one of your favorite home pages.
</p><p>This article will help you acquire the basic knowledge needed
to write HTML forms, and explains what needs to be done so that you
and your server can interact with your Web visitors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x104b5b0"></a>Elements of a Form</h2></div></div><p>A working form really consists of three basic elements. The
first is the form itself. The form is constructed using HTML text,
as for your homepage, with a few different markup tags. The second
element is the script or program. This program must be constructed
in accordance with the common gateway interface (CGI)
specification, if it is to communicate properly with your server
and the user's Web client. The CGI script is the engine behind the
interface; it will actually act on the data the user types into the
form. The third element is the httpd (hypertext transfer protocol
daemon) server, which calls the CGI program, passing it the data
the user has entered.</p><p>Let's take a look at what elements a form can posses. Much
like other HTML constructs, forms are built using markup tags and
simple text. A form is encapsulated by
<b  >&lt;FORM&gt;...&lt;/FORM&gt;</b>, where the
<b  >...</b> is replaced by text and other form markups.
Keep in mind that markup tags are case insensitive, though I will
continue to capitalize them for clarity. Following is a list and
descriptions of the major available form markup tags.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">&lt;FORM&gt;...&lt;/FORM&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates the start and end of an HTML form.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">&lt;INPUT&gt;...&lt;/INPUT&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates the start and end of form input.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">&lt;SELECT&gt;...&lt;/SELECT&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates the start and end of a selection
list.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">&lt;TEXTAREA&gt;...&lt;/TEXTAREA&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates the start and end of a free-form text
input area.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x104bd98"></a>FORM Markup Tag</h2></div></div><p>Form markup tags may use attributes to help control how a
form will be displayed to the user. Let's take each markup tag in
turn, and examine the valid attributes for each. First let's look
at the <b  >FORM</b> tag.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >ACTION</b></span></dt><dd><p>Typically a URL indicating a script or program to
be executed.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >METHOD</b></span></dt><dd><p>Valid values are <b  >POST</b> and
<b  >GET</b>.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The <b  >ACTION</b> attribute specifies a URL
(uniform resource locator) which will be used to carry out some
action based on what is entered in the form. The URL usually
specifies a program, which exists in a script directory on the
server. For instance,
<b  >http://some.server/cgi-bin/donothing.sh</b> will
result in the form data being returned to the program
<span   class="bold"><b>donothing.sh</b></span> for processing. The
program will then return an appropriate response to the
client.</p><p>The <b  >METHOD</b> attribute is used to specify
how the data which is entered into the form is to be returned to
the server. The data may be appended to the URL specified by the
action attribute using the <b  >GET</b> method. When the
<b  >GET</b> method is used, the http server will pass
the information to the <b  >ACTION</b> program encoded in
an environment variable. When the <b  >POST</b> method is
used, the http server will pass the information to standard
input.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;FORM ACTION="http://www.you.org/cgi-bin/donothing.sh" METHOD=POST&gt;
</pre><p>begins the definition of a form which is processed by the
donothing.sh script on the current host, which reads data from its
standard input.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x104c790"></a>INPUT Tag</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >INPUT</b> tags are used to specify fields
where data can be entered by the user. This tag, like all of the
remaining form markup tags, must appear between a
<b  >&lt;FORM&gt;</b> tag and its associated
<b  >&lt;/FORM&gt;</b> tag. Following is a list of valid
attributes.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >NAME</b></span></dt><dd><p>Indicates a symbolic name for the input field. The
<b  >ACTION</b> program uses this to differentiate
fields.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >TYPE</b></span></dt><dd><p>Specifies the type, such as
<b  >checkbox</b> or <b  >radio button</b>,
that is to be used.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >VALUE</b></span></dt><dd><p>This gives a default value for the input
field.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >CHECKED</b></span></dt><dd><p>A boolean indication of status for elements such as
checkboxes.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SIZE</b></span></dt><dd><p>The physical display size of text entry
fields.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >MAXLENGTH</b></span></dt><dd><p>The maximum allowable number of input characters
for text entry fields.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The <b  >NAME</b> of an <b  >INPUT</b>
field allows fields to be differentiated or grouped. The name of a
field is used by the <b  >ACTION</b> program to determine
what a user entered in each field of the form. The
<b  >NAME</b> attribute is also used to establish logical
groupings of some form element types, specifically radio
buttons.</p><p>Valid settings for the <b  >TYPE</b> attribute are
<b  >checkbox</b>, <b  >text</b>,
<b  >password</b>, <b  >radio</b>,
<b  >hidden</b>, <b  >reset</b> and
<b  >submit</b>. A <b  >checkbox</b> is an
element which can take on one of two states, either checked or not
checked. This provides a basic boolean true or false element for
form entry. The <b  >text</b> element provides a
single-line text entry field in which the user can enter data. A
<b  >password</b> field is a <b  >text</b>
entry field in which the entered text is hidden from view in some
fashion.</p><p><b  >Radio</b> buttons are groups of buttons which
allow a single button to be toggled at a time. The other buttons in
the group are untoggled when one button of the group is selected. A
<b  >radio</b> button group is established by setting the
<b  >NAME</b> attribute for each button in the group to
the same value.</p><p>A <b  >hidden</b> input is not displayed to the
user at all, and the user cannot modify it. A
<b  >hidden</b> input encodes state information into the
form. For instance, it might be possible to have one form which
should be processed in different ways, depending on context. Each
instance of the form could include <b  >hidden</b> input
indicating the context and directing the processing
appropriately.</p><p>Of particular note are the <b  >submit</b> and
<b  >reset</b> input types. Clicking on
<b  >submit</b> causes the form contents to be
transmitted to the server, and then to the
<b  >ACTION</b> program for processing. The
<b  >reset</b> button causes the form elements to be set
to their initial values, allowing the user to easily return the
form to its initial state.</p><p>A default value for a form element can be specified using the
<b  >VALUE</b> attribute. For text entry elements, this
indicates a default string of characters that are initially present
when the form is retrieved. If the field is a
<b  >radio</b> button, this is the value the element
takes on when it is checked (when the element isn't checked, it has
no value). For the <b  >submit</b> and
<b  >reset</b> elements, the <b  >VALUE</b>
attribute can be used to set the button label.</p><p>The <b  >CHECKED</b> attribute is valid only for
the <b  >checkbox</b> and <b  >radio</b>
elements. If the <b  >CHECKED</b> attribute is present,
the radio button or checkbox is toggled by default. Setting the
physical length of a text entry field can be done by using the
<b  >SIZE</b> attribute.</p><p>The <b  >MAXLENGTH</b> attribute limits the number
of characters that are accepted in a particular text entry
field.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x1446770"></a>SELECT Tag</h2></div></div><p><b  >SELECT</b> is the next major markup tag. The
<b  >SELECT</b> tag is used to encapsulate a selection
list. Several <b  >&lt;OPTION&gt;</b> tags may be
included between a <b  >&lt;SELECT&gt;</b> and a
<b  >&lt;/SELECT&gt;</b>, to add elements to the list. A
selection list may take on two physical forms. If it has a
<b  >SIZE</b> of one, it appears as a popup menu. If the
<b  >SIZE</b> attribute is greater than one, it appears
as a scrollable list displaying <b  >SIZE</b> options one
at a time. Here are the possible attributes of the
<b  >SELECT</b> tag:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >NAME</b></span></dt><dd><p>Indicates a symbolic name for the selection
menu.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >SIZE</b></span></dt><dd><p>The physical number of lines that are visible at
any time.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >MULTIPLE</b></span></dt><dd><p>If this attribute is present, multiple items of the
list may be selected at one time.</p></dd></dl></div><p>These attributes are straightforward, and I'll leave them for
your exploration later. Before we move on, I should mention a
little more about the <b  >&lt;OPTION&gt;</b> tag. The
option tag can have the attribute <b  >SELECTED</b>. When
present, this attribute indicates that a particular list item is
selected by default. The <b  >&lt;OPTION&gt;</b> tag is
much like the <b  >&lt;li&gt;</b> of normal HTML lists;
it does not require a terminating
<b  >&lt;/OPTION&gt;</b> tag. Instead, the appearance of
an <b  >&lt;OPTION&gt;</b> tag indicates the beginning of
a new list item and the termination of any preceding items. Also, a
selection list item can be only simple text. List items cannot be
marked up, nor can they be anchored items.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x1358f58"></a>TEXTAREA Tag</h2></div></div><p>A form element where a user can type in free-form text, much
like entering text into an editor, is constructed using the
<b  >TEXTAREA</b> tag. A text entry area is has the basic
form of:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;TEXTAREA&gt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>default text</em></span>&lt;/TEXTAREA&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  ><i><tt>default
text</tt></i></b> is the initial text, if any, which is
present in the text entry area. This form element has three
easy-to-use attributes.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >NAME</b></span></dt><dd><p>Indicates a symbolic name for the selection
menu.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >ROWS</b></span></dt><dd><p>The vertical size of the text entry area.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >COLS</b></span></dt><dd><p>The horizontal size of the text entry area.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x13597f0"></a>Assembling the Pieces</h2></div></div><p><a href="1096l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Simple HTML
Form</a></p><p>Now that we know what things we have available, let's create
a basic form. Listing 1 shows a simple HTML form, while
<a href="1096f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1(139K)</a> displays how Mosaic
might present this form.</p><p>Keep in mind that the <b  >ACTION</b> attribute
needs to specify your host and a valid script or program. In the
example, the shell script echo.sh (shown later) will be executed on
your.http.host when the form is submitted. The script or program
needs to reside in a directory which your server recognizes as a
valid location for executable programs. Be sure to check the
documentation for your server to be sure it is configured properly
to allow for this sort of execution. A typical location for these
sorts of programs is in the cgi-bin directory under the server
root, and that is how this example is configured.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x1359ab0"></a>Interacting with the Client</h2></div></div><p>The form is only one of the three parts necessary to interact
with a user. The second is the http server, which we will not cover
here (please refer to the documentation for your server). The third
is a CGI program or script. As mentioned above, these programs
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> reside in a directory recognized by the
http server as a valid location for executables. A CGI program
needs to be able to understand the encoded form data as it is
returned from a client, and must be able to respond appropriately.
The encoded form data will appear either on the command line or in
the environment variable <b  >QUERY_STRING</b>, depending
on whether a <b  >METHOD</b> of <b  >GET</b> or
<b  >POST</b> is used. Typically, a program needs only
write the necessary response on stdout, and the response will then
be transmitted back to the client by the http daemon.</p><p>A number of environment variables are also typically set by
the server for the CGI program's use. Following is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>partial</em></span> list of environment variables that I
find useful. Please refer to
<a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html" target="_self">hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html</a>
for further discussion of other environment variables.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >REQUEST_METHOD</b></span></dt><dd><p>Set to the <b  >METHOD</b> used to make
the request.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >QUERY_STRING</b></span></dt><dd><p>Set to the encoded form data when the
<b  >GET</b> <b  >METHOD</b> is used.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >REMOTE_HOST</b></span></dt><dd><p>Set to the remote hostname if available.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >REMOTE_ADDR</b></span></dt><dd><p>Set to the IP address of the remote host.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >CONTENT_LENGTH</b></span></dt><dd><p>The length of the data returned in a client's
query.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Usually, a CGI program need only respond to a request with an
appropriate http header, possibly followed by a document. The
response is simply written on stdout, where the data will be
returned to the client. A header consists of an http header
directive followed by a relevant text string. The header is
terminated by a blank line. Two of the most used header directives
are the <b  >Content-type</b> and
<b  >Location</b> directives. The
<b  >Content-type</b> directive indicates the type of
data which is to follow. For example, <b  >Content-type:
text/html</b> indicates that the document which follows the
header on stdout is written in HTML. The
<b  >Location</b> directive is used to provide a means by
which redirection can take place. For instance, <b  >Location:
http://goto.another.host/web/doc.html</b> would cause a
client to retrieve the document specified in the URL.</p><p>Probably the easiest way to explore the construction of a CGI
program is with an example. Listing 2 shows a shell script which
will respond to a client's HTML form request.</p><p><a href="1096l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The response is to echo the encoded query, some of the
environment variables, and the decoded content of the query. This
program is useful as a test program when creating new forms, and as
a base for building other CGI scripts.
<a href="1096f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2(135K)</a> displays the results
of posting the form shown in Figure 1 to this script.</p><p>Examine the <b  >QUERY_STRING</b> in
<a href="1096f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a> Notice that spaces are
encoded as addition signs, and that an ampersand in the input is
encoded as a hex value preceded by a percent sign. Also notice that
each name/value pair is separated by an ampersand. The shell script
decodes this string back into the data as it was entered by the
user. There are other programs, such as CERN's cgiparse, which will
also help you decode CGI form data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf53580.0x135ad98"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>You now should have the basic building blocks of form
construction and processing at hand. Many things which can be done
with HTML forms and CGI programs, including providing man pages via
http or constructing gateways for accessing other system
information. Good luck, and have fun!</p><p><a href="1096s1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Resources</b></span></a></p></div></div>
