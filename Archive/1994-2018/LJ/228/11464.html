A linguistic look at some tenets of Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180e580.0x1906300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Merriam-Webster</em></span> defines a tenet as &ldquo;a principle, belief, or doctrine
generally held to be true; especially one held in common by members of an
organization, movement, or profession.&rdquo; As it happens, Linux is claimed by
two doctrines that are to some degree at odds: those of free software and
open source. This contention began when Eric S. Raymond published
&ldquo;Goodbye, 'free software'; hello, 'open source'&rdquo;, on February
8, 1998
(<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/open-source.html" target="_self">www.catb.org/esr/open-source.html</a>). Here's an
excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Specifically, we have a problem with the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo;, itself, not
the concept. I've become convinced that the term has to go.
</p><p>
The problem with it is twofold. First, it's confusing; the term
&ldquo;free&rdquo; is
very ambiguous (something the Free Software Foundation's propaganda has to
wrestle with constantly). Does &ldquo;free&rdquo; mean &ldquo;no money
charged?&rdquo; or does it
mean &ldquo;free to be modified by anyone&rdquo;, or something else?
</p><p>
Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous. While this does
not intrinsically bother me in the least, we now have a pragmatic interest
in converting these people rather than thumbing our noses at them. There's
now a chance we can make serious gains in the mainstream business world
without compromising our ideals and commitment to technical
excellence&mdash;so it's time to reposition. We need a new and better label.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Richard Stallman, father of the free software movement, responded with
&ldquo;Why
Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html</a>),
in which he says, &ldquo;software
can be said to serve its users only if it respects their freedom&rdquo;, and that
open source allows software that does not value freedom. Which is true in
some cases.
</p><p>
But open source, as Eric and friends intended, won the popularity contest.
Today &ldquo;open source&rdquo; could hardly be a more common
expression&mdash;or more
out of control, serving as a two-word adjective modifying warfare, law,
publishing, ecology, government and much more.
</p><p>
Yet free software has not gone away. Its tenets remain the deeper stratum
of bedrock on which open-source tenets lie. The Free Software Foundation
also remains intact and influential, as do the Free Software Definition
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>) and
the Gnu General Public License
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License</a>), which Linux has used from the start.
</p><p>
My purpose here, however, is not to re-hash conflicts between these two
tenet-based value systems, but to look for understandings that arise out of
considering opposites of the words used to express base values. For
example,
we could ask, <span   class="emphasis"><em>What's the opposite of freedom?</em></span> A
variety of opposites&mdash;antonyms&mdash;come to mind, starting with slavery and imprisonment, both
of which are forms of captivity, so let's lay our first pair out like this:
</p><p>
Captivity&harr;Freedom
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freedom</em></span> is a noun derived from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>, which serves as adjective, verb and
noun. In the Free Software Definition's title, <span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> takes its adjectival
form. To explain, the Definition begins, &ldquo;'Free software' means software
that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, the users have the
freedom to <span   class="bold"><b>run, copy, distribute, study, change and
improve the software</b></span>.&rdquo;
The boldface is in the original and contains a series of transitive verbs,
all taking <span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span> as their direct object.
&ldquo;With these freedoms&rdquo;, it
continues, &ldquo;the users (both individually and collectively) control the
program and what it does for them.&rdquo; Thus, <span   class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span> is what you have with each
of those verbs. A clue toward the opposite of <span   class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span>
is the verb <span   class="emphasis"><em>restrict</em></span>,
which in various forms (including the noun
<span   class="emphasis"><em>restrictions</em></span>) appears ten times
in the Free Software Definition. In their dictionary definitions, both
freedom and liberty are posed against <span   class="emphasis"><em>restriction</em></span>. This leads to our next
pair of opposite nouns:
</p><p>
Restricted&harr;Free
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open</em></span> is used as an adjective in the Open Source
Definition (<a href="http://opensource.org/osd" target="_self">opensource.org/osd</a>) as well.
Likewise, <span   class="emphasis"><em>restrict</em></span> and its variants also appear in five of the Open Source
Definition's nine criteria, and twice in two of them. Is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>restricted</em></span> then
also opposite of <span   class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span>, as it is of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>? No, because the obvious antonym of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span> is <span   class="emphasis"><em>closed</em></span>, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>closed source</em></span> is commonly considered the opposite of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>open source</em></span>. Yet if you look up &ldquo;opposite of
open source&rdquo;, you'll tend to
find the word <span   class="emphasis"><em>proprietary</em></span>.
</p><p>
Back when <span   class="emphasis"><em>open source</em></span> was first being popularized and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>proprietary</em></span> was
commonly posed as its opposite, Craig Burton told me definitions were being
collapsed, and that we could see interesting possibilities if we
un-collapsed them. The opposite of <span   class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span> was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>closed</em></span>, he said; and the
opposite of <span   class="emphasis"><em>proprietary</em></span> was <span   class="emphasis"><em>public
domain</em></span>:
</p><p>
Open&harr;Closed
</p><p>
Proprietary&harr;Public Domain
</p><p>
If you rotate these two opposites 90 degrees from each other, he said,
you could create a 2x2 matrix that looks like this:

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11464f1.large.jpg"><img src="11464f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Matrix 1
</p></div></div><p>
He calls this the Burton Matrix, and he has made good use of it through the years
to make sense of what different developers choose to do, or to change. For
example, he says infrastructural protocols and software, such as the
Internet's and Linux, became ubiquitous by working in the upper-right
quadrant. One also could place companies, products, services, patents and
many other things in various places on the matrix and consider the merits
of moving them around. Software that is proprietary yet open in the
interoperable sense would fall in the upper-left quadrant. It could &ldquo;go
open source&rdquo; by moving over to the upper right. One can also
&ldquo;free&rdquo;
something by putting it in the public domain. So if we substitute
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>public domain</em></span>, and take the opposite of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> as well, we get this matrix:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11464f2.large.jpg"><img src="11464f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Matrix 2
</p></div></div><p>
This can be helpful for understanding what happens when software,
standards, patents and other forms of intellectual property&mdash;stuff
that is, technically, proprietary&mdash;is set free. It moves out of
captivity. One example of this is Ethernet, which was developed originally
at Xerox PARC, then set free by Xerox, Intel and Digital Equipment Corp.
(&ldquo;DIX&rdquo;), which together pushed forward standardization of Ethernet's early
specifications and implementations. Ethernet was widely adopted because it
lived in the upper-right quadrant of both matrices. Everybody was at
liberty to use Ethernet without restriction, even though it was proprietary
in the sense that it was owned. Thus, it became ubiquitous and essential
infrastructure for networking the world. Linux, on the other hand, was born
in the upper-right quadrant, and succeeded because competing operating
systems, including proprietary UNIX variants, were in either of the left
two quadrants. (And let's remember that Linux is a registered trademark of
Linus Torvalds,
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark/attribution" target="_self">www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark/attribution</a>, and proprietary in that very limited sense.)
</p><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>captive</em></span> pole is also important to consider as a motivation of
technology providers. Large companies especially are biased toward
capturing customers and users, and do this with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>proprietary</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>closed</em></span>
systems. IBM did this with its Token ring
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring</a>), a proprietary network protocol
that competed with Ethernet in the early days.
</p><p>
Linux and Ethernet also won for another reason, which shows up when one
looks at design and construction choices, as laid out by Stewart Brand
(<a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/Home.html" target="_self">sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/Home.html</a>) in
his landmark book <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Buildings Learn</em></span>. In the first episode of the BBC
six-part series of the same title
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvEqfg2sIH0" target="_self">www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvEqfg2sIH0</a>), Stewart
begins, &ldquo;Buildings are the
wealth of nations: our largest capital asset. They are the ornament of
cultures. And they are where we spend most of our lives. Some of our more
arrogant and careless buildings are at war with time and change, and they
always lose. Some buildings, though, seem to flow with time. They flow with
us.&rdquo; He also asks, &ldquo;What makes some buildings keep getting better, and
others not?&rdquo; In both the book and the TV series, Stewart unpacks different
approaches to architecture and construction that might also be posed as
opposites, and arranged on a matrix. (For a detailed examination of these,
see my article &ldquo;The New Vernacular&rdquo; in the April 2001 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4553" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4553</a>.)
</p><p>
The fancy end of architecture Stewart calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>magazine</em></span>. This is architecture
as art, where form often defeats function: &ldquo;Art begets fashion; fashion
means style; style is made of illusion; and illusion is no friend to
function.&rdquo; With <span   class="emphasis"><em>magazine</em></span> architecture, looks are what matter. They are
advertisements for themselves and their creators. The plain end he calls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vernacular</em></span>, which he says &ldquo;means common in all three senses of the
word&mdash;widespread, ordinary and beneath notice&rdquo;. He also says
it's &ldquo;what
gets passed from building to building via builders and users&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;is
informal and casual and astute&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The expensive end of construction he calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>high road</em></span>. This kind is imbued
with &ldquo;high intent, duration of purpose, duration of care, time, and a
steady supply of confident dictators&rdquo;. The cheap end he calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>low
road</em></span>: 
&ldquo;low-visibility, low-rent, no-style, high-turnover&rdquo;, adding,
&ldquo;most of the
world's work is done in Low Road buildings, and even in rich societies the
most inventive creativity, especially youthful creativity, will be found in
Low Road buildings taking full advantage of the license to try
things.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Placed orthogonally on a matrix, these two opposites look like this:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11464f3.large.jpg"><img src="11464f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Matrix 3
</p></div></div><p>
Linux is clearly <span   class="emphasis"><em>vernacular</em></span>, but has both
<span   class="emphasis"><em>low road</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>high road</em></span>
aspects.
At the kernel level, there is high intent, duration of purpose and care,
and confident dictators in the form of maintainers. In 2004, when I asked
Andrew Morton, one of Linux's top maintainers, if he thought Linux would be
around in 200 years, he answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; without hesitation. He also
said, &ldquo;On the kernel team we are concerned about the long-term viability
and integrity of the code base. We're reluctant to put stuff in for
specific reasons where a commercial company might do that.&rdquo; Yet Linux is
also <span   class="emphasis"><em>low road</em></span> in the sense that it's cheap, below the style radar, and
ideally suited for doing lots of real work.
</p><p>
With <span   class="emphasis"><em>vernacular</em></span> architecture, you can take either or both roads. Magazine
architecture is oblivious to either, which is why Stewart calls it &ldquo;no
road&rdquo;&mdash;even though it does have a way of paving over the low kind.
Often you see magazine-worthy buildings going up where low road buildings
have been torn down. For example, Lincoln Square in New York and Chavez
Ravine in Los Angeles were neighborhoods of low road buildings that were
easy for the cities to condemn and replace&mdash;in New York with Lincoln
Center and in Los Angeles with Dodger Stadium.
</p><p>
In those cases, cities lost neighborhoods. In some cases, there are
additional costs in work that can no longer be done because the environment
is less friendly to it. A prime example is MIT's Building 20
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20</a>), which Stewart
praises in <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Buildings Learn</em></span> for the great heights of its utility, and
for the countless inventions and innovations that flowed out of it in the
decades that followed World War II, when it was erected as a temporary
structure to house work on radar. Despite its nickname&mdash;&ldquo;The Magical
Incubator&rdquo;&mdash;Building 20 was replaced in 1998 by the Stata Center
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center</a>), 
designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. While the building is clearly
distinctive, it is also what Stewart calls an &ldquo;overpriced, overwrought,
unloved, unadaptable, much sued abortion&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/forget-apples-new-hq-celebrate-your-low-road-building/245697" target="_self">www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/forget-apples-new-hq-celebrate-your-low-road-building/245697</a>). In other words, the kind of
thing Linux's vernacular architects tend to say about proprietary software.
</p><p>
Which gets us back to tenets. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Free</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span> have maximal meaning as nouns
and verbs. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of Style</em></span>, William Strunk and E. B. White say,
&ldquo;Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs. The adjective
hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight
place.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of Style</em></span> is widely regarded as the best book ever
written about writing. Like good working code, it is an accumulation of
patches. Strunk published the original privately for his classes at Cornell
in 1918, and died in 1945. White, a former student of Strunk's, expanded
slightly on the original in 1957, and &ldquo;the little book&rdquo; quickly became
canon. Most of the text from Strunk's original, however, is unimprovable.
For example, &ldquo;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no
unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the reason
that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no
unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences
short, or that he avoid detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but
that every word tell.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The same might be said of code, and of the tenets that produce the best of
it.
