Make your own TinyURL.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9e358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mom always said, &ldquo;It's not nice to point.&rdquo; I'd argue Mom didn't manually
enter long, cumbersome URLs, however. We're all familiar with services
like TinyURL, but because we're Linux folks, we tend to prefer doing such
things on our own. As with almost everything in Linux, there's more
than one way to skin a cat, and in this article, I explore a bunch. (Note,
I really should Google &ldquo;skinning a cat&rdquo;, because now that I read it,
it's a rather morbid idiom!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9e510"></a>
Preliminaries</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in a URL-shortening solution is the domain name. If
you're trying to make short, memorable URLs, it helps to have a
short, memorable domain name. It doesn't save much time if you use
www.heycheckouthisreallycoolsiteifound.com to shorten up a link half
its size. So a short, memorable domain name is ideal. It's also the
toughest part of the equation. Sites like <a href="http://domai.nr" target="_self">domai.nr</a> can help,
but coming up with a short domain name is quite challenging. And thinking of one that
is memorable? Even more so. The best I could come up with after an
embarrassing amount of time searching was &ldquo;snar.co&rdquo;. It's not perfect,
but it makes me chuckle, and it's short.
</p><p>
The other piece of the puzzle is a Web server. The solutions I talk
about here vary in their requirements, but most need nothing more than a hosted
Web server, nothing fancy. It's helpful to have .htaccess modification
access, but if you don't have that sort of control over your Web site,
no worries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9e778"></a>
iframe&mdash;Maybe You Shouldn't Redirect at All</h2></div></div><p>
They're not terribly popular anymore, but back in the day when GeoCities
was the Web hosting platform most people used, several
&ldquo;domain cloaking&rdquo; services were available. This basically hid the long,
ugly URL by loading it inside an invisible frame. I've done that here:
<a href="http://snar.co/notgoogle" target="_self">snar.co/notgoogle</a>, and you can see a couple glaring problems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The page title is static and never changes when following links.
</p></li><li><p>
The URL in the address bar also never changes, which makes things like copying
a Web site's URL impossible.
</p></li><li><p>
Sometimes forward and back work as expected, sometimes not.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If those limitations don't bother you, maybe an iframe is all you need,
but it's a kludge at best. Creating a page like that is simple, however, so
if you want to give it a try, the above example uses the following code:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;This Is Not Google. Or is it?&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
&lt;iframe src="http://www.bing.com"  width="100%" height="100%" &gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9eca0"></a>
PHP, JavaScript and .htaccess Options</h2></div></div><p>
Although it may not be the most elegant solution, it's certainly possible
to use a custom .htaccess entry to provide a redirect. An entry like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Redirect /togoogle http://www.google.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9ee00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will send anyone requesting the /shortcode URL on your site to be
redirected to the other site. I've put this into action on my site,
so <a href="http://snar.co/togoogle" target="_self">snar.co/togoogle</a> should redirect you to Google. To be honest,
this might be all you'll ever need. If you have the rights and abilities
to use and modify an .htaccess file on your server, those little one-line
entries are quick and dirty, but they work well.
</p><p>
If you don't have the ability to edit or take advantage of .htaccess
files, a similar functionality can be attained using PHP or JavaScript. On
my server, I created two folders. One called javascriptgoogle and one
called phpgoogle. Inside the javascriptgoogle folder, I created a
file named index.html containing the following code:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script language="javascript"&gt;
window.location="http://www.google.com";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Surfing to <a href="http://snar.co/javascriptgoogle" target="_self">snar.co/javascriptgoogle</a> will show you the results
of that single JavaScript command. Sometimes JavaScript isn't ideal,
especially because it's so often to blame for malicious code, and many
folks turn off JavaScript in their browsers. In that case, perhaps PHP
is a better solution. In the phpgoogle folder, I've created a file named
index.php containing the following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
header("Location: http://www.google.com/");
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you visit <a href="http://snar.co/phpgoogle" target="_self">snar.co/phpgoogle</a>, you'll see the results of
this PHP code, namely you're redirected to Google's site. If you're keen
on entering redirects manually for your short URL solution, it doesn't
really matter which method you use. Although for compatibility purposes,
the .htaccess or PHP methods might be best, because the work is done on
the server side and not by the user's browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9f278"></a>
Getting Fancy with YOURLS</h2></div></div><p>
So now that I've looked at the geeky underbelly of URL redirection, it
seems like the perfect time to introduce YOURLS (<a href="http://yourls.org" target="_self">yourls.org</a>), which is a nifty open-source
program that clones the abilities of tinyurl.com, is.gd, bit.ly and such
the like. I didn't mention YOURLS at the start of the article, because
this is a learning column, and I truly wanted everyone to understand
how to redirect without fancy crutches like YOURLS. That said, it's a
really awesome tool!
</p><p>
YOURLS does some things the scripts and methods above just can't do. Some
of its more awesome features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Public or private mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Auto-generated or custom-chosen URL keyword (shortcode).
</p></li><li><p>
Stats, including number of clicks, referrers, geolocation and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Plugin architecture.
</p></li><li><p>
Full AJAX interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Developer accessible API.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It's also dead simple to install. Create a database with something like
phpmyadmin (or the command line if you're geeky enough), unzip the YOURLS
archive, edit the config.php file, and enter your database server
information. Then visit http://yourservername.com/admin/ and log in!
Figure 1 shows my admin page for http://snar.co, and it gives a list of
example links.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11467f1.large.jpg"><img src="11467f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The interface makes adding, modifying or deleting simple. (But, it
doesn't work right in Chrome; Firefox seems fine.)
</p></div></div><p>
Although the admin interface is a simple way to add and edit entries, one
of YOURLS' coolest features is the bookmarklet feature. In the
&ldquo;tools&rdquo; section of the admin screens, you'll see a section similar to
Figure 2, with a few different bookmarklets from which to choose. They all
function slightly differently, but they are fairly easy to figure out. I recommend
dragging them all to your browser's bookmark bar, so you can see which
method you prefer. From that point on, simply clicking the bookmarklet
when on a specific page will allow you to shorten the link with YOURLS
and give you the custom URL you can share with the world. Figure 3 shows
the bookmarklet in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11467f2.large.jpg"><img src="11467f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The bookmarklets make using YOURLS a breeze.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11467f3.large.jpg"><img src="11467f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A popup allows for custom URL creation.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0x1198180"></a>
Statistically Awesome</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have YOURLS set up, and you've shortened all the URLS you can
imagine shortening, the next cool thing to check out is the stats. Much
like bit.ly, with YOURLS you can open the stats page for a particular
link by adding a + to the end of the short URL. So for Figure 4, I
simply surfed to <a href="http://snar.co/map+" target="_self">snar.co/map+</a>, and after logging in, I got to look at
all the glorious clicks I've received. The information is quite useful if
you're looking for how popular your particular shared URLs have become. As
mentioned above, the statistics YOURLS generates are quite extensive.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11467f4.large.jpg"><img src="11467f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Although my stats aren't impressive here, the actual functionality is
pretty awesome.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0x1198498"></a>
Where to Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>
YOURLS provides an excellent interface for short link creation. It
also offers a simple bookmarklet feature for creating short
links on the fly. Thanks to its API, however, the coolest part
of YOURLS is that it can be integrated into other programs
as well. WordPress, for example, has an excellent plugin
(<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yourls-link-creator" target="_self">wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yourls-link-creator</a>), which
integrates into WordPress. Instead of using a third-party URL shortener,
WordPress will use your custom YOURLS install with your custom short
domain name!
</p><p>
When it comes to URL shortening, or even just simple redirection, there
are many ways to accomplish the task. There are also dozens of free
redirection services available, many of which offer similar features
to YOURLS. When it comes to controlling your data, however, it's hard
to beat a solution you host yourself&mdash;if you can come up with a decent
domain name, that is. Sadly, that's often the most difficult part!
