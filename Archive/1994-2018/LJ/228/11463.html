Opengear Lighthouse CMS</h2></div></div><p>
The new Lighthouse CMS product line from Opengear is an out-of-band
management solution with both virtual and hardware platforms that is
optimized for critical IT infrastructure and distributed networks. The
vendor-neutral Opengear Lighthouse solution includes new hardware offerings
and updates the previous CMS software to version 4.0. Opengear says that
both software and hardware appliances may operate in standalone or in
redundant configurations, a feature that allows customers to deploy the
solution that best fits their environment. Another new feature is the
upgraded centralized dial functionality that provides network engineers
and administrators quick and easy connection to remote locations. This
builds on Opengear's cellular Call Home technology to converge central
management of remote sites whether they are connected in-band or
out-of-band over the cellular network or legacy PSTN.

Silhouette</h2></div></div><p>
Just off the ticker at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s Hollywood bureau and talent agency
is entertainment-industry news from SilhouetteFX LLC, whose new Silhouette
v5 represents this post-production software's &ldquo;most significant upgrade
in its history&rdquo;. Silhouettefx, first launched in 2004, is a major

important tool in the 2-D to 3-D conversion workflow. Four key upgrades found

warping and morphing, and the inclusion of Academy Award-winning planar
tracking technology from Imagineer Systems' mocha Pro. In addition to these
major advances, Silhouette v5 adds numerous features and changes, such as
automatic stereo alignment, depth channel support, local disk caching for
speedy playback, filled shapes, object searching, source transformations,
an improved and more accurate planar tracker, and the ability to rotate the

Compuware's Workbench</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Long live the mainframe&rdquo; trumpets Compuware, maker of the newly
upgraded Workbench solution. Workbench is a standardized point-and-click
mainframe application development interface that &ldquo;future
proofs&rdquo; a
company's mainframe assets. The need for Workbench is based on the fact
that traditional mainframe environments underpin large volume transactions
across a number of businesses, and these systems utilize a complex and
antiquated mainframe development environment, with which many newer
developers are not familiar. The Workbench gives new developers the tools
to produce high-quality applications that drive business success, as well
as prevent application outages and other business risks when experienced
developers retire and take their knowledge with them. The upgraded
Workbench now features faster and more efficient file and data management
capabilities&mdash;including the ability to edit complex IMS
databases&mdash;and
more robust debugging functionality, all designed to boost
developer productivity significantly.

James A. Bach and Robert G. Werner's <span   class="emphasis"><em>How to Secure Your H-1B
Visa</em></span>
(Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Are you a foreign national seeking to work in IT in the US or an employer
seeking to hire one? The ticket to entry is the H-1B visa, the gateway for
the world's best and brightest to live and work in the United States. A
new resource for navigating the maze of H-1B laws, policies and procedures
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>How to Secure Your H-1B Visa: A Practical Guide for International
Professionals and Their U.S. Employers</em></span>, new from Apress. Written by veteran
Silicon Valley immigration lawyers, the book lays out the whole H-1B
process from petition to visa to status maintenance to visa extension and,
ultimately, to permanent residence in the US. It shows you step by step
exactly how the H-1B process divides up between the employer and employee.
Additional coverage areas include administrative and enforcement trends,
special conditions that apply to nationals of particular countries,
complementary visas for family members and H-1B substitute visas for
professionals with particular skill sets or from particular countries, such
as Australia and Canada.

Onset's HOBO UX100 Series</h2></div></div><p>
Put the kibosh once and for all on incessant office whining (&ldquo;It's
too hot!&rdquo;
&ldquo;It's too cold!&rdquo;) with Onset's next-generation HOBO UX100 series of
temperature/RH data loggers for building performance monitoring. These
matchbox-sized devices, which can be deployed nearly anywhere, bridge the
gap between traditional loggers, which typically don't have LCD
displays and are limited in accuracy and memory, and larger, more expensive
LCD loggers that require calibration. Building owners, facility managers,
energy auditors and other users can collect indoor
environmental data quickly and easily in a broad range of applications, such as monitoring
occupant comfort in office buildings, tracking food storage conditions in
warehouses, logging temperature trends in server rooms, and measuring
humidity levels in museums. Onset's complementary HOBOware Pro software
enables users to view, analyze and batch-configure the deployed data
loggers for maximum benefit.
