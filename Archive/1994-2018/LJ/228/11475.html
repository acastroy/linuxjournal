Finally, &ldquo;The Cloud&rdquo; Means Something

Few jargonistic terms have annoyed me as much as &ldquo;The Cloud&rdquo;. When the
term was first coined, its meaning was ambiguous at best. For some
companies, it meant shared Web hosting (but with a cooler-sounding name).
For others, it was simply, &ldquo;let us host your servers in our data center,
which we now refer to as a cloud.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Then, finally, the concept started to solidify into offering specific
services or entire software applications as a commodity removed from the
server infrastructure. Honestly, I think that was the intent from the
beginning, but it took several years before anyone really implemented
anything useful in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Software as a Service (SaaS) is arguably the largest implementation of the
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo; ideology. I never really had heard of Platform as a Service
(PaaS) before reading up on the upcoming IBM webinar here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
(Full disclosure: I'm sure there is a financial partnership of some sort
involved with the webinar. I don't know those details; I'm writing because
I found it interesting!)
</p><p>
In my day-job situation, I need to deploy a Java-based application for our
intranet. Because we don't have a Java application server environment, the
biggest chore for me is figuring out what application server or what
servlet container to implement. Then I have to configure it, maintain it
and keep it updated with both Java itself and the Web server components.
That's where PaaS comes in. Instead of buying a software package as a
service (SaaS), PaaS allows me to deploy whatever Java applications I want
onto a fully installed, maintained and updated Java application server.
</p><p>
The PaaS concept piqued my interest, and perhaps it piques yours. At the
very least, it gives more meat to the concept of cloud computing, which is
always a good thing. Oh, and for the record? Shared Web hosting was cloud
computing long before it was cool&mdash;just saying.
