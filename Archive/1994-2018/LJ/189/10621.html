What do search and rescue, Amateur Radio and Linux have in common?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x26317d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the early 1990s, Bob Bruninga, an instructor at the United States Naval
Academy in Annapolis, devised an interesting stunt: he wanted to track the
Army/Navy game football on its travels from Annapolis to Philadelphia,
about 150 miles away. To do this, Bruninga stuffed a small electronics
package into a football helmet consisting of a GPS receiver, an
Amateur Radio transmitter and a radio modem. At the time, GPS receivers
were quite expensive (and a novelty), and cell
phones still were quite new and incapable of doing data. Bruninga's real
innovation, however, was to plot the received position reports on a
computer map display and automatically track the position of the midshipmen
carrying the game ball (see Resources).
</p><p>
That was one of the first uses of the Automatic Position Reporting
System (APRS)&mdash;originally, Amateur Position Reporting System. APRS
has evolved considerably in the decades since. The protocol has been
greatly enhanced to include automated weather station reports,
status messages and two-way text messaging. APRS communications
systems have evolved beyond simple transmitters and receivers to
sophisticated networks that encompass Amateur Radio satellites,
digipeater (digital repeater) automatic relay systems and
Internet gateways. APRS technology is not confined to Amateur Radio;
it is used in numerous commercial applications as well.
</p><p>
APRS is intended to provide a situational awareness display or
tactical display. Everything of note should be displayed easily on
the map with additional detail and messaging available at a click.
In emergency operations, a quick glance reveals what resources
are available and where.
</p><p>
Note: APRS is a registered trademark of APRS Software and Bob Bruninga,
WB4APR.

Introducing Xastir</h2></div></div><p>
Imagine a map display on your laptop with moving symbols
representing the current positions of your ham radio friends and
acquaintances, while they can see your real-time position on their
displays. Imagine being able to &ldquo;instant message&rdquo; any of them as
well. These are a small subset of Xastir's capabilities, and they can be
accomplished with a small amount of equipment and an entry-level
Amateur Radio license (see sidebars).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10621f1.large.jpg"><img src="10621f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Census Bureau Tigermap Server)
</p></div></div><p>
Xastir is open-source software, which aims to be compliant with and
interoperable with the APRS protocol. Frank Giannandrea, KC2GJS, wrote
the first version of X Amateur Station Tracking and Information
Reporting (XASTIR) for Linux and released it under the GPL license. As
with many open-source projects, even though Frank has retired from
the project, a team of developers has continued and considerably
extended Frank's original work. Xastir is arguably one of the most
capable APRS implementations and has an active user community.
</p><p>
Xastir can be compiled and run on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris,
HP/UX and even Windows. Today Xastir can display objects and their
associated status (and messages) in real time on Internet-based or
local maps, enable two-way messaging between stations and many more
functions. Some Xastir users are involved in search and rescue (SAR),
others in helping out at public service events or Amateur Radio
emergency organizations, but many use it just for fun.
</p><p>
You can get started in Xastir with Internet-based maps and data
streams. Advanced users have radio interfaces connected to laptops or
touchscreen trunk-mount PCs in their vehicles where it gives a
tactical display of nearby stations while providing mobile mapping
and letting everyone know their current position. Xastir also
can speak via the Festival speech synthesizer.
</p><p>
Note: although Xastir is described here as Amateur Radio software,
nothing specifically ties its use to Amateur Radio. There are
alternative radio systems that require no licensing and allow data
transmissions between stations. Networks can be deployed using such
systems and Xastir; however, you would lose access to the rich set of
interconnected networks that exist in the Amateur Radio APRS system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2631f60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Info:</b></p><p>
What are these odd groups of up to six letters and numbers
after people's names? Amateur Radio call signs! Like television and
radio stations, each ham has a unique call sign representing a
transmitting station.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2632170"></a>
Linux APRS Bits</h2></div></div><p>
Linux is special and not just for the reasons most of you already know.
Linux was the first operating system to have the Amateur Radio AX.25
packet protocol actually built in. Currently, it's a pluggable kernel
module, but in the early days, we had to compile custom kernels to
enable it.
</p><p>
AX.25 is based on ITU-T X.25, with a few additions that let us
store and forward or digipeat (digitally repeat) a packet through
multiple stations on RF (radio frequencies). This allows us to
create a network from multiple radio stations on the same frequency.
To the computer, an AX.25 port looks like any other networking port,
so you must guard against sending out broadcast packets from some
common Linux applications that can trash our low bit-rate radio
channels. Firewalls or specific configuration of each errant d&aelig;mon
are the fixes.
</p><p>
Once you set up an AX.25 interface, you can share it across multiple
applications, run special digipeater or server software, or run
multiple protocols across it. See the AX.25 HOWTO on the Xastir
Wiki (see Resources) or the older AX.25 HOWTO for setup details.
</p><p>
Note: a simpler method for APRS only is to use the Serial KISS
TNC interface within Xastir to talk directly to a serial port,
USB&rarr;Serial adapter, or soundmodem terminal node controller (TNC). This method does not let
you share the TNC across multiple applications, however.
</p><p>
For the TNC, there are several options. Software only (mostly?)
options include the soundmodem driver on Linux/Solaris or AGWPE
on Windows. See the soundmodem HOWTO on the Xastir Wiki for
details (see Resources).
</p><p>
Most operators prefer a hardware TNC over the software solutions above.
We recommend KISS mode for long-term reliability. The alternate TNC
mode, command mode, was designed for human interaction and, thus,
is prone to timing errors and commands getting lost or
misinterpreted. KISS is a much simpler protocol; the computer does
most of the protocol processing work instead of the TNC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2632430"></a>
Internet APRS Bits</h2></div></div><p>
An entire tiered network of servers moves packets around the
Internet and connects the various radio networks together, called the
APRS-IS (APRS Internet Services). With proper gateways, two APRS
stations anywhere in the world can exchange two-way messages.
Alternative networks exist for Citizen's Weather (CWOP) data and for
emergency-minded or weather-minded folks who wish to see more
objects (Firenet.us). Firenet is one of Curt's interests; he
contributes earthquake, weather, fire and river gauge scripts, also
plotting positions of steam-train excursions.
</p><p>
Home stations can have a radio interface, can connect as clients of
APRS-IS or Firenet, and optionally may choose to be a one-way or
two-way igate (Internet gateway) between the Internet and radio.
One-way igates (RF&rarr;INET) are welcome any time, but two-way igates
are best coordinated so that they don't compete for limited airtime
in one area. The typical two-way igate passes only APRS messages and
ACKs/NAKs for stations it has heard recently on the local
frequency. Mobile travelers can send and receive messages from their
current locations, as the igates will route the messages
appropriately. Xastir can function as such an igate, but if you need
more advanced igate functions, other applications may be better
suited.
</p><p>
Other important pieces of the infrastructure are Internet databases
with Web front ends. See the Resources section of this article to find
out more, specifically the info.aprs.net link, and click on APRS
Internet System&mdash;it'll be well worth your time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2632640"></a>
Xastir Major Features</h2></div></div><p>
Compared to other APRS clients, Xastir really excels in the map
department with 125 types of maps, including topo maps, street maps, aerial
photographs, weather alerts and radar images. It can use on-line or
local map sources, or combinations of both. Map stackups can be
custom-designed by the user in nearly any combination.
</p><p>
We do not support or condone use of proprietary map formats, but
there are plenty of free maps from which to choose. You also
can grab screen captures of maps you own and easily georeference them
for use with Xastir. For those coming from the Windows side, UI-View
maps can be converted with our inf2geo.pl script for use with
Xastir. This helps users outside North America immensely, as they
often lack access to the free maps we enjoy here.
</p><p>
For contiguous topographic maps from USGS DRG maps, Xastir topo code
crops the white borders and stretches the image into a rectangular
shape while drawing. Maps are stitched together into a contiguous
view.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10621f2.large.jpg"><img src="10621f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Xastir Topo Maps, Simulated SAR Mission, Mt. Pilchuck (Maps

</p></div></div><p>
Xastir supports direct or network connection to weather stations,
GPSes and TNCs. Several coordinate grids/systems are supported:
UTM/UPS, MGRS, USNG, Maidenhead grid and multiple
latitude/longitude formats. A Coordinate Calculator is included
that converts between many of these formats.
</p><p>
Menus can appear in any of seven real languages and five &ldquo;not so
real&rdquo; languages. Curt took a bit of heat from other developers for
adding those last five &ldquo;languages&rdquo;, but you know beer-fueled
coding sometimes yields interesting results! All kidding aside, he
was asked to support Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19th every year).
He found pirate-speak REGEX plus several other &ldquo;languages&rdquo;, so
he added
five in total. He's proud to be a supporter of Talk Like A Pirate
Day, the only international holiday created from a sports injury!
</p><p>
Dig in to the menus, and you'll find some SAR-specific features, as well as
features useful for public-service
event tracking. Xastir is used for SAR, marathons, bicycle,
motorcycle and car events.
</p><p>
Though Xastir and APRS are not well suited or intended for this
application, one ham, when his vehicle was stolen, was able to tell
police the car's current location, direction and speed. It does
take some work though to explain to the police how you know this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2632c70"></a>
How to Use Xastir</h2></div></div><p>
First and foremost, sign up on the Xastir users mailing list (see
Resources). Many helpful experienced users and quite a few of the
developers hang out there. Posting requires a subscription, so sign
up before you need it. Lurking and &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; questions are fine.
Everybody learns or relearns a bit, and newbies are not harassed
there.
</p><p>
Check the Xastir home page (see Resources),
specifically the &ldquo;XASTIR Documentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Text docs distributed
with Xastir&rdquo; sections for useful documentation. Of course, look in
the Xastir source main directory or the default install location of
/usr/local/share/doc/xastir/ for the text docs as well.
</p><p>
Run Xastir for the first time, and it takes you to the
File&rarr;Configure&rarr;Station dialog to enter your call sign and location
and to choose a symbol that will appear on others' maps. Some symbols
have special significance, so if you have a question, please ask on
the list.
</p><p>
Visit the File&rarr;Configure&rarr;Defaults dialog next. Note that antenna
height is not height above sea level (ASL), but height above average
terrain (HAAT). Curt once lived at 150 feet ASL but &ndash;450 feet HAAT due
to surrounding hills, but the protocol doesn't allow for negative
HAAT; perhaps they figured no ham would live under such conditions!
</p><p>
If you have Internet connectivity, go to Map&rarr;Map Chooser, click on
Online/Tigermap.geo, then click OK. If you're located in or near
the US and zoomed in sufficiently, you should see Tigermap street
maps appear shortly. If you don't have connectivity or are missing
libraries to fetch maps, stick to built-in vector map formats like
ESRI Shapefile. A map of the world in ESRI Shapefile format is
included.
</p><p>
Hint: start Xastir from an xterm to catch error and warning
messages. Also, check File&rarr;Configure&rarr;Timing&rarr;Internet Map Timeout
to ensure it's adequate.
</p><p>
You probably will want to see other stations, weather alerts and the
like. Go to Interface&rarr;Interface Control. Click Add, then
Internet Server, then Add. You should see a new Internet
Server entry on the Interface Control dialog. Click on that entry
and then Properties. Enter server and port information into the
form. Try rotate.aprs.net port 14580 with filter parameters of
m/600, which causes reports for all stations within 600km to
appear on the map. Enter a passcode to log in to the server, and see the
callpass program that comes with Xastir. Send a position to the
server if using the range filter, or the server won't know which
stations to send you.
</p><p>
Run this script as root to fetch Shapefile maps for weather alerts:

Service)
</p></div></div><p>
For mouse functions, turn on emulate third button in your OS if you
have a two-button mouse, as Xastir can use all three buttons of a
three-button mouse. See the text docs distributed with Xastir for
details on each function. Toggle buttons at the top of the screen
change how the mouse buttons work, specifically Measure, Draw
and Move. The cursor changes when in these modes to give visual
verification. While we're at it, a few defines in xastir/src/main.c
allow swapping mouse buttons and touchscreen operation, for those
who aren't afraid to compile their own.
</p><p>
A few special keys include HOME (centers the map on your house or car),
PageUp/PageDown (zoom keys), arrow keys (pan keys). Toggle buttons at
the top of the screen provide most of these functions also.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x2629c38"></a>
Transmit Paths</h2></div></div><p>
The AX.25 protocol has multiple slots in the header of each packet for
digipeater call signs, which APRS uses for a flooding protocol. One
packet floods an area out to X digipeaters in all directions. Think
of it as a time-to-live count or as a distance limit for each
packet.
</p><p>
Currently accepted digipeater paths include WIDE2-2 or WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1
for home stations and WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 for mobile stations. Either
path will give you two hops outward in all possible directions.
Never use WIDE1-1 as anything but the <span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> digipeater call sign in
the path; it triggers home station fill-in digis as well as
mountain-top digis.
</p><p>
By following the above (currently only North American)
recommendations, you can travel between RF networks without
reconfiguring your tracker. High-altitude balloon or
airplane-mobile trackers likely will need to reduce their paths to
prevent interfering with many RF networks at once. Rocketry
enthusiasts often run high packet rates on alternate frequencies due
to their short flights (five or ten seconds); this avoids
interference with the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; APRS network on 144.39MHz.
</p><p>
For &ldquo;tin-foil hat&rdquo; types, there are special path aliases for the end
of your path to keep packets from being gated to the Internet:
NOGATE and RFONLY. These are respected by most igate software.
</p><p>
Please stay abreast of the current national recommendations for your
country&mdash;the above recommendations may not apply. If you're not
part of the solution (and up to date), you're part of the problem,
which definitely applies here!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x262a000"></a>
Tactical Calls for Special Events</h2></div></div><p>
A very useful recent addition to Xastir is the capability to assign
tactical call signs to stations and to transmit them across RF or
the Internet to other APRS clients (Xastir and APRS+SA are the only
two clients that currently decode and display tactical call
assignments).
</p><p>
We added this capability just prior to the Seattle Marathon in
November 2008 and used it to great effect at that event. It
allowed us to assign call signs, such as LEAD and TAIL, to APRS
stations helping in the event, without having to change their
tracker configurations. This aids reliability when we're not
tweaking tracker settings before the event. The old &ldquo;if it ain't
broke, don't fix it&rdquo; method really does work when dealing with
mobile trackers. Don't touch a working tracker unless you have to.
</p><p>
Xastir also was used to good effect in the New York City Marathon.
Officials love it for its instant and eye-catching tactical display.
You'll see them hanging around the Xastir display when they're not
otherwise engaged.
</p><p>
SAR tactical call signs provide similar
advantages, assigning TEAM 1, HELO 2, DOGTEAM 3 and similar
monikers to teams in the field. Special features have been added to
Xastir to support SAR operations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2539580.0x262a268"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Example: Seattle Marathon</b></p><p>
For the Seattle Marathon, I (Curt) sit in the net control vehicle
with the &ldquo;route&rdquo; and &ldquo;start/finish&rdquo; radio guys. Xastir is running on
a Linux laptop with Internet access, along with a remote LCD display
for the radio operators to view the current event map. Bob Donnell,
KD7NM, has a similar station several hundred feet away at the first-aid station. Trackers are assigned tactical call signs like SAG 1
prior to the event or at the beginning of their assignments.
</p><p>
I listen for runner pick-up or aid requests from the radio operators
and send instant messages to Bob. Bob then dispatches vehicles (SAG
wagons) via voice radios to pick up the runners. Positions of all
SAG wagons appear on both of our maps.
</p><p>
SAG vehicles can't cross the course, so it's tricky getting them to
the correct locations. The map display allows Bob to dispatch the
vehicle that would be quickest to pick up the runners&mdash;you must
know how to route vehicles when Seattle is bisected by this event.
</p><p>
We place trackers on the lead vehicles for both the full and half
marathons&mdash;problematic due to the choice of electric vehicles,
which so far haven't completed the mission. If these trackers become
unavailable, we shift to monitoring voice reports on the route
network and create objects to represent them on the map. The
trailing vehicle is driven by a ham who usually can keep its tracker
running, although we have the same fallback plan.
</p><p>
Event organizers use the trailing runner information to adjust
support needs at the finish line, and we use the information to keep
the volunteer hams up to date on the approach of the final runners.
The volunteers then share this information with the rest of the
marathon volunteers in their area. This helps ensure that we don't leave
anyone behind on the course at the end of the day and lets us know
when to open streets and when to pick up ham volunteers and
equipment.

Xastir's Future</h2></div></div><p>
From its meager beginnings as a Linux-specific application, Xastir
has grown significantly in capability but is still tied to OpenMotif
or Lesstif for its widget set. Xastir is a large multithreaded
and multiprocess program. Developers have talked about splitting
Xastir into an SQL database back end plus a d&aelig;mon with multiple
clients to handle user interface functions. Such clients could use
different widget sets, such as Qt, GTK+ or WxWidgets, with
correspondingly better integration with modern-day window managers.
Rewriting to use Qt without the X11 layers underneath might allow
for running on Qtopia embedded devices. In any case, whether we refactor
Xastir, it has a bright future as its user base continues to
grow and useful features are added continually. See you on the
mailing list!

Glossary</b></p><p>
Amateur Radio has been doing digital communications literally since there
has been wireless communications. We first used CW (Continuous
Wave) or On/Off keying with Morse code. Abbreviations quickly
became commonplace. After WWII, surplus teletypes (the heavy, loud
electromechanical monsters you see in old movies) became available
at reasonable prices and ham radio RTTY (radio teletype) was born,
and keyboard shortcuts and abbreviations became even more
commonplace.
</p><p>
We use a lot of abbreviations&mdash;Q-codes during voice and
especially CW conversations (CW or Continuous Wave means Morse
code). Even the word conversation has an abbreviation: QSO.
</p><p>
Quite a few of our abbreviations have roots in the Morse code world,
spilling over into our e-mail and instant messaging. If we type
&ldquo;hi hi&rdquo; to you, that means laughter. &ldquo;QTH&rdquo; equals location. This
is similar to instant-messaging abbreviations that many of you use
with SMS messaging or e-mail.
</p><p>
Here are some other common terms:

APRS: Automatic Position Reporting System.
</p></li><li><p>
AX.25: the packet radio link-level protocol we use.

Getting an Amateur Radio License</b></p><p>
Many people think of Amateur Radio operators as old guys sitting in the basement
in front of a radio with glowing tubes, tapping on a Morse code key.
</p><p>
The good news is that Morse code is no longer a requirement in the
US. Tubes have been replaced by transistors, integrated circuits,
embedded processors and software defined radio (SDR). We have
satellites in orbit, had digipeaters on the international space
station and (now expired) MIR, and do EME and EVE signal bounces
(Earth&rarr;Moon&rarr;Earth and Earth&rarr;Venus&rarr;Earth). It's not your
grandpa's ham radio anymore!
</p><p>
License types have been streamlined to three: Technician Class,
General Class and Amateur Extra Class. Each license grants
additional privileges, mostly in the form of additional allowed
frequencies. The entry-level Technician Class allows you to
participate in the APRS network described in this article along with
many additional privileges.
</p><p>
Many barriers to getting a license have been removed. Tests are
no longer given by the FCC field offices, but by volunteer
examiners. In large urban areas, there may be multiple places to
take a test each month. Practice tests are available on-line (try
<a href="http://www.qrz.com" target="_self">www.qrz.com</a> and others). For more information about Amateur Radio
licensing, or where to find testing in your area, go to <a href="http://www.arrl.org" target="_self">www.arrl.org</a>
and click on Licensing.
</p><p>
Note: the information above is US-centric. Each country has a regulatory
body governing Amateur Radio and often a national Amateur Radio
organization. Contact your national organization or regulatory body

Equipment Needed for Xastir/APRS</b></p><p>
1) Minimum requirements: a live Internet feed, Linux (or another
UNIX/UNIX-like operating system) and Xastir.
</p><p>
2) Adding Amateur Radio to the mix: Linux, a soundcard, the
soundmodem package, a two-meter ham radio, a valid ham radio
license and Xastir. It is possible to configure this setup with or
without the Linux AX.25 library.
</p><p>
Note that it's completely legal to own Amateur Radio equipment without an
Amateur Radio license, as long as you use the equipment
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> to receive.
Transmitting on Amateur Radio frequencies without a license is blatantly
illegal, and the community is capable (and motivated!) to hunt down
troublesome rogue transmissions, and the FCC has a long tradition of prosecuting miscreants.
</p><p>
3) A more reasonable station: Linux plus a hardware TNC in KISS
mode, a two-meter radio and a valid license. Again, one
can configure with or without the Linux AX.25 library.

To build a portable or mobile tracker, many options exist that
don't involve carrying around a full-blown laptop. Go to

Curtis E. Mills, WE7U, became active in packet radio in the mid-1980s,
creating a receive-only station from a radio, a single-chip
interface circuit and custom assembly code. He's active in search
and rescue and contributes to Firenet, Xastir, SmartPalm and
gpsbabel development. Other interests are hiking and bow hunting
when his kids aren't running him ragged. He's employed as an
engineer at Fluke Corporation. Reach him at
<a href="mailto:archer@eskimo.com">archer@eskimo.com</a> or as
WE7U-3 on APRS. He also can be found on Xastir, NWAPRS and
APRSSIG lists.

Steve Stroh, N8GNJ, had his first experiences with TCP/IP networking
via Amateur Packet Radio on the Puget Sound Packet Radio TCP/IP
network (WETNet) in the late 1980s. From hanging out with that bad
crowd of techies, Steve became a sysadmin (on systems lesser than
Linux) and in 1997, began writing about broadband wireless Internet
access based on his practical experience with wireless gained from
being a ham. He's looking forward to some winter projects, including
diving deep into open-source wireless mesh networks, embedded
ARM-based Linux systems, running IPv6 over Amateur Packet Radio
and getting a number of radios back on the air after a long absence.
Steve can be reached at <a href="mailto:steve@stevestroh.net">steve@stevestroh.net</a>.

Laura Shaffer Mills studied engineering, but prefers writing
software in any convenient language. She hopes to learn something
new from every project and particularly enjoys solving problems
that no one else had found. She relaxes with wire harp or tatting,
since both are quite rare. Laura lives with her husband and three
daughters and can be found at <a href="http://www.redwriteblue.com" target="_self">www.redwriteblue.com</a>.
