Answer simple Twitter queries automatically.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f8580.0x23f03b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month wrapped up with a problem so complex we had to delve into
a different programming language to create a solution to the 
mathematics of calculating the distance between two lat/lon points on
the globe. My head's still spinning. I long ago graduated computer
science, so what the heck?
</p><p>
This month, I thought we should move back to something a bit more fun and
perhaps a bit less complicated (well, maybe not, we'll see) and return
to Twitter.
</p><p>
What I've been thinking about is how helpful it would be to have a
bot that listened to my Twitter stream and answered simple queries
directly without human intervention. Stores could have a bot respond
to queries like &ldquo;hours?&rdquo; and &ldquo;address?&rdquo;, and
students could have
their schedule preprogrammed, and the bot could answer queries like
&ldquo;class?&rdquo;
by indicating what class students were in at that moment.
</p><p>
In fact, there's a local startup here in Boulder, Colorado, that is moving down this
path called Local Bunny (<a href="http://localbunny.com" target="_self">localbunny.com</a>), but it's doing a real,
fully thought-out solution. By comparison, I'm going to show you a bubblegum and
bailing wire approach!

Listening to Your Twitter Stream</h2></div></div><p>
To track a Twitter stream from an individual, it's quite easy: a call to the
right URL with curl does the trick:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl http://twitter.com/status/user_timeline/davetaylor.xml
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll give you my last dozen tweets or so, along with a lot of additional
information, all in XML format.
</p><p>
What we want, however, are mentions of an account or pattern, which
require you to supply login credentials. This call is a bit more
complicated, but you still can accomplish it with curl:


<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -u "davetaylor:$pw" http://www.twitter.com/statuses/mentions.xml
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I've set pw to my account password (you don't really want
to know my password, do you?). The output, however, is something else. For an
individual tweet, there are 42 lines of information that come back (for a
140-character tweet).
</p><p>
It's too much to show you here, but try the command yourself and be astonished
at the output.
</p><p>
To trim it down, let's use grep with a regular expression to extract the
Twitter ID of the person who sent the Tweet that mentions @DaveTaylor,
and the tweet itself:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;text&gt;@DaveTaylor  Have them send the money in gold bullion.&lt;/text&gt;

  &lt;screen_name&gt;LenBailey&lt;/screen_name&gt;

&lt;text&gt;@DaveTaylor Escrow.com&lt;/text&gt;

  &lt;screen_name&gt;Ed&lt;/screen_name&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see here that the first tweet is from @LenBailey, and the second
from @Ed.
</p><p>
Turning this into coherent output is a tiny bit tricky, because we really
want to merge line pairs into a single line that denotes message and
ID. That's a job for awk:


<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{if (NR % 2 == 1) { printf ("%s",$0) } else { print $0 }}'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if we feed the curl output to this, we'll see:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;text&gt;@DaveTaylor  Have them send the money in gold bullion.&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;screen_name&gt;LenBailey&lt;/screen_name&gt;

&lt;text&gt;@DaveTaylor Escrow.com&lt;/text&gt;  &lt;screen_name&gt;Ed&lt;/screen_name&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Next step: let's get rid of the XML artifacts and reformat it to be a bit
easier to parse. We also can axe @DaveTaylor, because we know it's
to this account already (in the actual code, it's one invocation, but here
it's easier to show it in two lines for legibility):

<pre     class="programlisting">

sed 's/@DaveTaylor //;s/&lt;text&gt;//;s/&lt;\/text&gt;//' |
sed 's/   &lt;screen_name&gt;/ == /;s/&lt;\/screen_name&gt;//'

www.xetrade.com ?  == kiasuchick
 Have them send the money in gold bullion.  == LenBailey
Escrow.com == Ed

</pre>
</p><p>
That's more like it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f8580.0x23f10c0"></a>
Parsing Twitter Messages</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start by doing something simple. If you &ldquo;@&rdquo; my Twitter account
with the command date, it'll detect it, actually run the date
command, and send out the results on my behalf.
</p><p>
To do this, we'll want to split the data stream into &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tweeter&rdquo;, but we can do this in a tricky way by tweaking the earlier
awk string to create name=value pairs:


<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{if (NR % 2 == 1) { printf ("msg=\"%s\"; ",$0) } 
 &#8618;else { print "id="$0 }}'
</pre>
</p><p>
The result:


<pre     class="programlisting">
msg="escrow"; id=Stepan
msg="www.xetrade.com ?"; id=kiasuchick
msg=" Have them send the money in gold bullion.  "; id=LenBailey
msg="Escrow.com"; id=Ed
</pre>
</p><p>
Nice. Now we can use the underutilized eval command in the growing
script to set the variables msg and id to the two,
and then check msg for known values. Now, if you're sharp,
you'll realize tweets that include double quotes are a bit of a problem,
but fortunately, the Twitter API is smart too. All single quotes pass through
as is, but double quotes are rewritten as the HTML entity &amp;quot;.
</p><p>
Let's pause for a second so I can show you what I've built so far:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$curl -u "davetaylor:$pw" $inurl | \
  grep -E '(&lt;screen_name&gt;|&lt;text&gt;)' | \
  sed 's/@DaveTaylor //;s/  &lt;text&gt;//;s/&lt;\/text&gt;//' | \
  sed 's/    &lt;screen_name&gt;//;s/&lt;\/screen_name&gt;//' | \
  awk '{if (NR % 2 == 1) { printf ("msg=\"%s\"; ",$0) } 
   &#8618;else { print "id="$0 }}' &gt;
$temp
</pre>
</p><p>
That grabs the 20 most-recent tweets for the specified user and
converts them into <tt  >msg="message"</tt> and
<tt  >id=userid</tt> for each one. Fed
to eval in a loop, we now have a very easy way to parse things:

<pre     class="programlisting">

while read buffer
do
  eval $buffer
  echo Twitter user @$id sent message $msg
done &lt; $temp

</pre>
</p><p>
Let's wrap up the column here for now, but next month, we'll take the next
step and actually parse the Twitter &ldquo;@&rdquo; messages being sent to me, trying
to find those that match the predefined queries we've set, act upon them and
respond.
</p><p>
This is going to be a pretty cool project when we're done!
