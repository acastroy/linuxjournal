Cucumber's plain-text integration testing is as useful as it is innovative.

People used to say that open-source technologies were excellent at
mimicking and copying proprietary projects, but that they had few
original ideas of their own. This was never completely true, but I
believe that today it is demonstrably false, and that it becomes
increasingly false over time. In many respects, the bleeding edge of
innovation in the computer industry is taking place within the
Open Source community. If you're looking for the future of operating
systems, network protocols, Web development or programming
techniques, the odds are quite good that you'll find it by looking at
open source.
</p><p>
Ruby on Rails, the well-known Web development framework, is such a
technology; nearly every other language now has its equivalent of
Rails. Rails certainly has been influential on other frameworks in
many ways, from its use of MVC to its pervasive &ldquo;convention over
configuration&rdquo; stance. But, Rails also is leading the way through its
use and encouragement of automated testing. Testing has existed for
some time in the computer world, but the Ruby community in general
and the Rails community in particular are almost fanatical in their
desires to test programs extensively, at multiple levels. Such
testing, as many others have written over the years, gives you the
confidence you need when changing, improving and just
refactoring existing code.
</p><p>
For the past few months, I have been looking at a number of testing
technologies that came from the Ruby and/or Rails worlds,
which I believe are likely to have an impact on other, slower-moving
languages and environments. The one thing all these tests
have in common is that they are of interest primarily to the
programmer. That is, the programmers working on a project all
might agree on the need for testing and even on a framework for doing it.
The nontechnical managers of a project, although they might benefit from
such testing, don't participate in this process very closely, because
they typically cannot do so. After all, even Shoulda's syntax, for
all its simplicity over standard test/unit constructs, is still in
code and, thus, is hard for nonprogrammers to read and understand.
</p><p>
Enter Cucumber, the oddly named but extremely powerful integration
testing framework begun by Aslak Hellesoy. Cucumber is part of the
BDD (behavior-driven design) school of thought, which argues that
development should begin with a specification, and then the code will be written to
match that specification.
</p><p>
Typically, in frameworks such as RSpec and Shoulda, the specification
is written in code. Cucumber takes a different approach, making it
possible to write specifications in English, or other natural
languages, and for the computer to take care of translating those
specs into an executable format. In this way, the specs still
are executable, but they also are readable by nonprogrammers, making it
easier to discuss at meetings or in documents. I haven't
experienced this firsthand, but it should be possible for
nonprogrammers to read the Cucumber stories and begin to execute
them.
</p><p>
Cucumber can be used in a variety of testing contexts, but it is most
commonly used by Rails programmers for integration tests, and many
of the people using it are raving about the effect it has on their
development process. This month, I introduce Cucumber, which I
believe has the potential to change the ways 
integrated tests are written and executed dramatically, and which is another clever
invention by a member of the Open Source community. I'll walk
through the creation of some simple Cucumber tests, and I'll point out
where it requires just a bit more ripening. (Vegetable jokes are a
staple of the Cucumber community, for better or worse. So, if you plan
to use Cucumber, it'll be useful if you find such humor a-peel-ing.)

Installing and Using Cucumber</h2></div></div><p>
Cucumber has undergone a number of rapid transformations in the past
year alone, thanks in no small part to a growing number of
contributors, as well as a great deal of excitement and exposure
within the Ruby community. As a result, it is sometimes hard to keep
up with version numbers and documentation.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the installation process for Cucumber remains fairly
straightforward; it comes packaged as a Ruby gem, which means that you
can install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install cucumber
</pre>
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Cucumber is at version 0.4. Moreover, while
Cucumber (and many other Ruby gems) have been hosted by GitHub (a
well-known commercial repository for the Git version-control system),
it recently was announced that GitHub no longer will support the
creation of Ruby gems. So, you might need to look around for
Cucumber's official repository when you read this.
</p><p>
Once you have installed Cucumber, you need to add its
functionality to your Rails application. You can do this with the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/generate cucumber
</pre>
</p><p>
This puts the appropriate Rake tasks into place (in
lib/tasks/cucumber.rake), adds the initial default step definitions
(that is, low-level test implementations) and the overall system support
that is necessary for Cucumber to function. All of the files
associated with Cucumber are put inside the features directory,
which can be somewhat confusing to the uninitiated.
</p><p>
Once these new files are in place, you can run Cucumber as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake cucumber
</pre>
</p><p>
Cucumber will run through any file with a .feature suffix in the
features directory. If you just installed Cucumber, no such
files will exist yet, and you will see output like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
0 scenarios
0 steps
0m0.000s
Loaded suite /usr/bin/rake
Started

Finished in 0.000232 seconds.

0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre>
</p><p>
This is similar to the output you would get from running <tt  >rake
test</tt> without any tests installed. So let's get started and write
something.
</p><p>
Cucumber uses a different vocabulary for creating tests and
specifications than you might be used to. Each Cucumber file
describes a single &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of the application and has a .feature
suffix. A feature typically will be a small slice of the
application&mdash;anything from authentication, to sending or receiving messages, to
producing a report. The feature traditionally is described with a
line like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Feature: Home page
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this file begins with the word &ldquo;Feature:&rdquo;, and then
contains a description. This description, like many others in
Cucumber, appears in the output later on, as a helpful
description.
</p><p>
Following the Feature declaration, you describe the feature,
typically in the form of a &ldquo;story&rdquo;, as used in many agile teams and in
the BDD world in general. (If you are new to stories, I suggest
reading Dan North's blog post on the subject; see
Resources.) Here is a typical story:

<pre     class="programlisting">
As a user,
I want to be able to log in
So that I can use the system
</pre>
</p><p>
The feature is then tested in a number of ways, each of which is known
as a scenario. The idea is that each scenario describes a situation
(Given) in which the user performs some actions (When), and then
sees some results (Then). The scenario should be as specific as
possible, testing a particular path through the application's
interface.
</p><p>
Note that the scenario is not meant to test one particular controller,
model, library or other element of the code. Rather, the scenario
should represent a particular action from the user's perspective,
which might cover one controller and one model, or a dozen of each.
It's normal and reasonable to have a number of scenarios for each
feature. It also is reasonable to assume that the number of scenarios
will grow over time, as you (and your users) stress the application in
new and different ways, and you uncover bugs that need to be covered
by new scenarios. A scenario consists of one or more steps, which
are translated into working Ruby code. Here is a sample scenario:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Scenario: Get to the login screen

      Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" with an e-mail 
      address "reuven@lerner.co.il"
      When I go to the home page
      Then I should see "Web site"
      Then I should see "Login"
</pre>
</p><p>
I put this scenario (with its story and one feature) into
features/login.feature, and then ran <tt  >rank cucumber</tt>. Cucumber
responded by going through the file, executing the scenario I had
defined. Well, it tried to execute the scenario; here is what I
actually saw on the screen:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Feature: Home page

As a user,
I want to be able to log in
So that I can use the system

  Scenario: Get to the login screen      
  # features/login.feature:7
    Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" with an e-mail
     &#8618;address "reuven@lerner.co.il" # features/login.feature:9
      Undefined step: "a user named "Reuven"" (Cucumber::Undefined)
      features/login.feature:9:in `Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" 
      with an e-mail address "reuven@lerner.co.il"'
    When I go to the home page     
    # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:15
    Then I should see "Web site"   
    # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:123
   Then I should see "Login"       
   # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:123

1 scenario (1 undefined)
4 steps (3 skipped, 1 undefined)
0m0.012s
You can implement step definitions for undefined steps 
 with these snippets:

Given /^a user named "([^\"]*)" "([^\"]*)" with an 
 &#8618;e-mail address "([^\"]*)"$/ do
|arg1, arg2, arg3|
  pending
end

rake aborted!
Command failed with status (1): 
 [/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/...]
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, Cucumber looked for a definition that would handle my
step &ldquo;Given a user&rdquo;, but did not find one. It stopped
interpreting my scenario and threw an error. Cucumber then went
further, reminding me that I needed to define this step and giving me
an outline for it.
</p><p>
A step definition, as you can see from Cucumber's suggestion, is a
regular expression attached to a Ruby block. The regular expression
is matched against the Given (or When or Then) statement, with
one item matched using parentheses (the standard way of matching in a
regular expression), which is then handed to the block as an argument.
</p><p>
Now, let's take the simple step definition and stick it into
features/step_definitions/authentication.rb. When rerunning <tt  >rake
cucumber</tt>, Cucumber no longer can complain that this step definition
is not defined. Rather, it signals that because the step definition
is pending, it cannot continue with the rest of the scenario. Let's
define this Given step:



<pre     class="programlisting">
Given /^a user named "([^\"]*)" "([^\"]*)" with an 
 &#8618;e-mail address "([^\"]*)"$/ do
|first_name, last_name, email|
    @person = Person.create(:first_name =&gt; first_name,
                            :last_name =&gt; last_name,
                            :password =&gt; 'password',
                            :email_address =&gt; email)
end
</pre>
</p><p>
You might have noticed that this step definition changed from the
original, expecting two quoted words rather than one, with the block
taking two parameters rather than one. Let's change the scenario
definition so that it contains the step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" with an e-mail
 address "reuven@lerner.co.il"
</pre>
</p><p>
Running this in Cucumber gives the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Scenario: Users who go to the home page are asked to log in
# features/login.feature:7
     
Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" with an e-mail 
 &#8618;address "reuven@lerner.co.il" 
 # features/step_definitions/authentication.rb:1
  When I go to the home page   
  # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:15
  Then I should see "Web site" 
  # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:123
  And I should see "You must first log in" 
  # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:123

1 scenario (1 passed)
4 steps (4 passed)
0m0.473s
Loaded suite /usr/bin/rake
Started

Finished in 0.000167 seconds.

0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are wondering who defined the three final steps, look no
further than the right-hand side of the output: Webrat, a browser
simulator written in Ruby, understands a large number of browser-style
step definitions, including &ldquo;I go to&rdquo; and &ldquo;I should
see&rdquo;, allowing you
to test for the presence or absence of text in each situation.
Cucumber provides a wide variety of Webrat step definitions, such that
you can tell Cucumber to go to a page, to fill in a form or to use
selection lists, check boxes and radio buttons.
</p><p>
This is basically what it means to work with Cucumber. You create a
feature in a .feature file and write one or more scenarios in that
.feature file, the lines of which are matched by regular expressions
defined in the step_definitions directory. The fact that the .feature
file is written in English, from the perspective of the user, means
you can show it to nontechnical managers or clients. They 
even can help write scenarios, and if the scenarios aren't
written perfectly for the purposes of Cucumber, they can understand that you are
trying to test the application from a variety of perspectives.
</p><p>
It feels a bit strange (at least, it did in my experience) to write
scenarios in Cucumber, because you're basically writing code, but in
full English sentences. It also took me some time to internalize the
fact that each English sentence is similar to a subroutine call,
invoking a particular piece of code in the step_definitions
directory. Over time, you presumably will create a large library of
such step definitions, which you then mix and match within your
Cucumber scenarios to test your system.
</p><p>
Here is a second scenario I wrote, in order to test logging in:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Scenario: Users can log in by entering their 
 name and e-mail address
Given a user named "Reuven" "Lerner" with an e-mail
 &#8618;address "reuven@lerner.co.il"
When I go to the home page
 And I fill in "reuven@lerner.co.il" for "email_address"
 And I fill in "password" for "password"
 And I press "submit"
Then I should see "Welcome back to the site, Reuven!"
</pre>
</p><p>
Once my two scenarios pass, I commit them to version control and keep
them in my application, in the features directory. 
</p><p>
If my new scenario doesn't pass, I go through the same iterative
process as before&mdash;either writing step definitions or fixing bugs
in the code to make sure the steps pass. But, Cucumber is a bit
slow to execute, so it can be a pain to run through all the
features and all the scenarios. So, you can run Cucumber
manually, rather than via Rake:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cucumber features/login.feature
</pre>
</p><p>
You even can indicate that you want to run only the feature 
starting on line 13 of the file in question:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cucumber features/login.feature:13
</pre>
</p><p>
This can be a real time-saver when you have a lot of scenarios in a
single file and you are trying to debug only one of them.

More about Cucumber</h2></div></div><p>
Cucumber is a well-thought-out system, with a large number of features
and abilities that correspond closely with Web developers' needs. First,
the step definitions in Cucumber can use either RSpec (the
default) or Shoulda, two BDD testing frameworks that have become quite
popular in the Rails community.
</p><p>
As I mentioned previously, you can use Cucumber to test models and controllers,
and not just for integration testing. My personal preference has been
to use Cucumber in this way, however, because it provides a nice,
user-side perspective on things and lets you test the site as a user
would.
</p><p>
Well, it lets you test the site as a user would, but with one large
caveat: Webrat is a great tool, but it doesn't support JavaScript.
This means if your site has a great deal of AJAX and JavaScript,
you will not be able to test it via Webrat. There are ways to get
around this problem, both using Webrat (for example, by including textual
links in your application) and by using external testing systems,
such as Selenium or Celerity/Culerity. But I have yet to find a
system that is easy to integrate, reliable and runs on servers as
well as on my desktop.
</p><p>
The fact that Cucumber is slow is a bit of a drawback; it can take
quite a while to run through all of the scenarios on a large
application. One solution is to use Cucumber's tag feature, which
allows you to give one or more tags to a scenario. Then you can run
all the scenarios with that tag, across all the features.
</p><p>
If you want to avoid hitting the database each time you create or
update (or find) an object, you can integrate a factory (for example, Factory
Girl) with Cucumber. This can speed things up, as well as give you a
great deal of flexibility in creating scenarios and testing your application.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Cucumber is an innovative approach to testing that has really grown on
me and demonstrates the power of English-language,
story-based testing to a degree I have yet to see elsewhere. If
you are developing in Ruby, I strongly suggest you take a
look at integrating Cucumber into your own work.
