An overview of common Amateur Radio activities with information about how
to participate using a Linux system and free software.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b1250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Maintaining a Linux-only household is getting easier every day. The large
number of people working to port or re-implement desktop and general-use
software from other operating environments helps keep the progress going.
Enjoying a hobby that is mostly dominated by Windows users is, unfortunately,
not nearly as easy. The Amateur Radio culture is one of experimentation and going
against the mainstream, but the relatively small number of people pushing
innovation are doing so on their platform of choice or comfort, which usually
means Windows. As a result, many applications are not available for Linux.
</p><p>
In this article, I cover some of the basic tasks that a Linux user venturing into the
world of Amateur Radio might be interested in doing without undergoing a
significant lifestyle change. First, here's a quick vocabulary lesson for those not
familiar with some common radio terms.
</p><p>
The HF (High Frequency) bands are frequencies between about 1.8MHz and 30MHz,
starting just above the US AM broadcast radio band. Signals on these
frequencies are capable of traveling around the globe, thanks to the upper
ionosphere. If you want to talk to another country, these are the bands for
you.
</p><p>
The VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) bands are
frequencies above 30MHz up to about 3GHz. Signals in this range propagate in
an increasingly line-of-sight manner and, thus, are mostly useful for local area
(VHF) and very short range (UHF) communication. However, these frequencies
also provide an opportunity for increased bandwidths and data rates, which is
why Wi-Fi sits at the upper range (2.4GHz).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b1510"></a>
Contest Logging</h2></div></div><p>
One popular activity on HF is &ldquo;contesting&rdquo;, which involves making long-distance
contacts to achieve some sort of goal. This usually involves making as many
contacts to different places as possible in a certain period of time. Because
it is a contest, some sort of log is needed to record the contacts you make for
later submission. Because Amateur Radio operators use call signs to identify each
other, most logging software helps identify people you've already
&ldquo;worked&rdquo; to
avoid duplication.
</p><p>
The Xlog program for Linux provides basic contest log functionality, including
duplicate checking. It also can interface to your radio via a serial port to
record other bits of information about a contact automatically, such as mode,
signal strength and frequency. Each contest specifies a different piece (or
pieces) of information that must be exchanged between operators, so Xlog has
some configurable fields to help with that task (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10616f1.large.jpg"><img src="10616f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b18d8"></a>
HF Digital Modes (PSK, RTTY and Others)</h2></div></div><p>
Another very popular activity on the HF bands is operating the
slow-speed digital modes. Some of these modes, such as RTTY
(radioteletype), predate modern digital
computers. Others, like PSK31 (phase shift keying, 31 baud), are fairly recent inventions that use
advanced signal processing to their advantage. Although external hardware
(digital and analog) previously was used to operate these modes, it now is very
common to use a modern soundcard to encode and decode the signal, much like a
modem does for a telephone line.
</p><p>
The most common application for doing this sort of work on Linux today is
called Fldigi. With a soundcard, serial port and some interfacing to
your radio, you can transmit and receive these digital signals without any
significant expense. The Fldigi software supports a large number of operating
modes, allowing you to communicate via keyboard-to-keyboard text with other
amateur operators around the world.
</p><p>
In addition to conversing directly in real time with other amateurs, you 
also can use Fldigi to record and report the signals it hears in an autonomous fashion.
By leaving your radio on the standard PSK31 calling frequency, Fldigi will
listen for and report the call signs and locations it hears to a public
database. This is very valuable information when comparing the stations other
locals are hearing, given the differences between your locations, antennas
and so on.
It also gives you an idea of what time of day signals from a particular
part of the globe are reaching you, in case you want to contact someone
in a specific place. If you're interested in this sort of operation, check out
the live map (see Resources) to find out who is hearing whom right now.
</p><p>
Although it may seem quaint and obsolete, if you've never had a half-duplex text
conversation at 31 baud with someone on the other side of the world, you don't
know what you're missing&mdash;double that if you've ever done it with nothing more
than a battery, a radio and a piece of wire hung in a tree!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b1b40"></a>
VHF/UHF Packet</h2></div></div><p>
When most people think about Amateur Radio, they picture a geek sitting by a big
radio under an even bigger antenna clicking out letters and words in Morse
code. If you still have this stereotype stuck in your head, perhaps the
following discussion will clear things up. Although the HF bands are used for
long-distance communications on low frequencies using large antennas, VHF is
more about local communication using higher frequencies and smaller antennas.
VHF and UHF are the bands used by everyone from taxi drivers to police radios for reliable local
communication. Licensed amateur operators are allowed many more privileges on
these bands, however, including the use of much higher power and automated
stations, such as beacons, message-forwarding systems and data networks.
</p><p>
Wireless networking is a hot topic right now, especially when it involves the
use of large transmitters to blanket a wide area with network service. Did you
know that Amateur Radio operators have been doing this since the mid-1980s?
Albeit at a much slower speed, amateur packet networks have been in place for a
long time, providing very wide-area access to various types of networks,
including the Internet.
</p><p>
Historically, amateur packet networks have operated using a protocol suite
called AX.25, which provides both Layer 2 and Layer 3 functionality. More
common today, however, is the use of AX.25 at Layer 2 with IP at Layer 3.
Linux has had AX.25 (and obviously IP) support integrated into the kernel for
quite a long time. With this support, a $150 radio and a $75 TNC (terminal node controller) interface,
you can link your Linux box to a packet network using IP at about 1,200
baud.
It's definitely slower than even the slowest Wi-Fi links on a bad day, but you
can enjoy this link for tens of miles with only modest equipment and longer
with a little effort. You won't want to do any serious Web surfing over this
link, but it's actually not too bad for a Telnet or POP3 session. With a
little more expensive hardware, you can move up to 9,600 or 19,200 baud, which is
similar to the speed offered by many modern satellite phones.
</p><p>
Most distributions include AX.25 support in the kernel and require
installation of only the userspace tools package(s) to get started. Extensive
configuration is beyond the scope of this article, but the following steps are
enough to get an IP link on the air.
</p><p>
First, configure the AX.25 port by putting something like the following in
/etc/ax25/axports:

<pre     class="programlisting">
radio KK7DS 9600 255 2 MyRadio
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, attach your serial TNC to the AX.25 interface and give it an IP address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# kissattach /dev/ttyS0 radio 44.1.2.3
</pre>
</p><p>
Configure the TNC parameters for transmit delay and so forth:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# kissparms -p radio -t 100 -s 100 -r 25
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, if the other end is set up similarly, you should be able to
ping, Telnet or do whatever else you want over your IP-over-AX.25 interface.
To bring the interface down, simply <tt  >killall
kissattach</tt> to disconnect.
</p><p>
One of the privileges we are not granted is encryption over the air. The reasons
for this are well documented in Part 97 of the Federal Communications
Commission's rules, so I won't go
into them here. However, you might wonder how you can run any sort of a secure
system without the use of modern encryption. Obviously, care must be
taken, and
privacy never can be achieved. However, clever use of a one-time-password
scheme can provide some protection against casual password sniffing. I have
effectively utilized the One Time Passwords in Everything (OPIE) tools by
configuring the system to use pam_opie instead of pam_unix for authentication.

D-STAR: Digital Smart Technologies for Amateur Radio</h2></div></div><p>
Most of the technologies I have discussed so far originated in the
previous century and, thus, are quite old. One newcomer to the scene is the
D-STAR system. Describing both a new on-air mode as well as a system for
interconnecting nodes over the Internet, D-STAR has brought some 21st-century
functionality to the hobby.
</p><p>
The ever-growing D-STAR network consists of repeater systems that provide RF
access for radios in a local area, and which are connected to each other via
the Internet. Much like early cell-phone systems, calls can be routed between
users on the system without needing to know which &ldquo;cell&rdquo; the other is in at any
given moment. With the exception of the infrastructure (which runs exclusively
on Linux, by the way), D-STAR is mostly a voice mode, so it doesn't present
much of a problem for Linux users.
</p><p>
There are, however, three things that D-STAR provides that may prompt you to
want to plug your Linux computer in to your radio. The first is slow-speed data
transmission, which involves transmitting data alongside the voice traffic at
slow speeds. This can be useful for position reporting (all D-STAR radios can
be plugged in to a GPS directly) as well as transferring small files. For this,
the D-RATS software (see Resources) can be used and is natively supported on Linux.
</p><p>
In addition to slow-speed data transfers, D-STAR has a high-speed transport
that doesn't waste any space with voice traffic and provides 128kbps of
throughput over coverage areas of tens of miles. Luckily, this system behaves
just like an Ethernet bridge, which means Linux is an equal-opportunity player
here as well.
</p><p>
Finally, the D-STAR network can be accessed without a radio at all, using a
piece of hardware called a DVDongle. This dongle encapsulates the voice
encoder used in D-STAR radios and, when coupled with software on a desktop
computer, allows you to connect to the Internet-linked infrastructure and
communicate by voice with radio users in another area. This is a marriage of
VoIP-like functionality with radio that has become very popular among D-STAR
enthusiasts. The good news is the software for this also runs natively on
Linux!

What Else Is Out There?</h2></div></div><p>
I have covered only some of the more-common activities that Linux users looking
to venture into the world of Amateur Radio are likely to be interested in. There
are many other interesting areas of activity, and in almost all cases, there
is a way to participate as a Linux user. For example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System):
location-aware services are starting to emerge as our mobile telephones gain
the hardware, connectivity and software required to support them. As with
many things, Amateur Radio operators are ahead of the curve here as well.
For more than
two decades, operators have been pairing radios and modems with GPS receivers
to transmit their positions to others. Initially used for local-area
positional awareness during public events, the system now is interfaced to the
Internet, providing a way to track people from a Web browser using Google Maps.
APRS is easy and inexpensive to use, and it provides features and functionality
above even some so-called modern services. On a recent trip, I was more than 
100 miles away from cellular coverage, but my friends were able to track my
position through the APRS system.
</p></li><li><p>
Satellite communications:
did you know that Amateur Radio operators have satellites in space for the sole
purpose of facilitating communications? With an inexpensive radio and some
creative antenna work, you can communicate with an amateur satellite for the
purposes of digital exchange or even analog voice calls. Linux users are not
excluded from this activity. If your distribution provides the gpredict
package, take a moment to install and run it. You might be surprised to see an
amateur satellite passing overhead as you read this (Figure 2).
</p></li><li><p>
SDR (Software Defined Radio):
historically, radios have been complex purpose-built analog devices that depend
on a lot of filters, resonant circuits and other components. Increasing
performance of these devices often means adding additional filter stages
and,
recently, embedding
Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) to cut noise and block unwanted interference.
A new generation of radio technology recently has emerged that uses very
simple, wideband, general-purpose radio components and relies on the high
performance of a modern PC to do all the hard work. The result is what is
called a Software Defined Radio or SDR. These systems have incredible
sensitivity and are extremely flexible. Several projects exist that are
working to push the envelope of this new technology, but the most interesting
to Linux users probably is the GNU Radio Project (see Resources).

Figure 2. The GPredict program shows where amateur satellites are in real 
time.
</p></div></div><p>
Clearly, there are many natural interactions between the Open Source
community and the Amateur Radio community, and you will be amazed and surprised
at how many current projects have been inspired by Amateur Radio or adopted by it.
