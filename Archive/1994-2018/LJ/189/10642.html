KVM and VNC
</h4><p>
In Bill Childers' &ldquo;Virtualization Shootout: VMware Server vs. VirtualBox vs.
KVM&rdquo; in the November 2009 issue, there's a mistake: KVM does
support headless VNC. That's the way I use it in a Debian server to have a
Win Server VM for hosting an antivirus server for Win PCs, not available
for GNU/Linux.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dani Guti&eacute;rrez  <br><br>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill Childers replies:</b></span>
I indeed made a mistake when doing the research for this article. (Don't
let Kyle Rankin know, I'll never hear the end of it!) Turns out, you can get
a VNC-enabled console simply by adding a <tt  >-vnc :1</tt> switch when starting
your KVM virtual machine. Sadly, when doing research for the article, my
Google-fu failed me&mdash;I kept getting instructions for the &ldquo;KVM&rdquo; type
of keyboard/video/mouse switches. I'm glad it supports headless
mode, and I'm sorry I missed that in my research. However, this
does highlight the issue that KVM's usability isn't where it should be
to compete with VirtualBox and VMware on that playing field. This is a
moving target though, and I'm confident the developers will continue
to improve KVM.

Ruby Articles
</h4><p>
I have been a dedicated <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader for many years and generally
like the mixture of different topics. However, in recent months, I've grown more
and more annoyed with the series of Ruby articles. Reuven M. Lerner is
doing a good job. It is not about the quality of his work; it is about
choosing the right topics for the magazine. Ruby is not by any means the most
popular language (<a href="http://www.langpop.com" target="_self">www.langpop.com</a>) in either the open-source or
commercial space. I think it is time to yield magazine space to other
programming languages.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
MK   <br><br>
</p><p>
You are absolutely correct in regard to Ruby not being the most popular
language in use. I think it might be the current state of the language's
maturity that is sparking so much interest. I'm not a programmer at all
(well, the occasional bash script, but that doesn't count), so I asked a
similar question a while back. Reuven's column is still very highly rated
by our readership. Although Ruby may not be the most popular language,
it does appear to garner a lot of interest. I can only assume that,
in time, it will pass, and the next fancy language will take its place.
In the meantime, thank you for the letter. I'm sure Reuven will read it
and keep an ear out for what is most sought after.&mdash;Ed.

VirtualBox
</h4><p>
I recently installed Sun's VirtualBox after reading the &ldquo;Virtualization
Shootout&rdquo; article in the November 2009 issue. It's a great tool that allows me
to keep Windows set up for those occasions when I can't figure out how to do
something in Linux. As a relative newbie who works in an all-Microsoft
environment, I wasn't getting the exposure to Linux I wanted, because I had to
dual-boot between the two OSes. Virtualization gives me the best of both
worlds. So, now I boot only to the Ubuntu Linux host and open my virtual
Windows XP guest system when needed.
</p><p>
I love your magazine and look forward to every issue. I read all the
columns, most of the reviews and at least scan the Indepth articles. Every
month, I find new information and ideas I use to grow in my
understanding of Linux. Next year, I plan to install Linux from scratch for
the knowledge it will bring. Thanks again for the all information and
expertise you pack into every issue.

Zarafa
</h4><p>
I know you get lots of e-mail messages saying &ldquo;why don't you write about
...&rdquo;, but
I will add this for the record: 
take a look at Zarafa&mdash;it's a fully native Linux-compatible GPLv3 groupware alternative
for Exchange <span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> Outlook support at no extra cost!
</p><p>
I have spent approximately four years researching GPL groupware solutions and
have tried several (Scalix, eGroupWare, Zimbra, Citadel and Open-Xchange), but none of
them come close to matching the features and support of this app. It does
calendaring, task lists, contacts, e-mail, BlackBerry and mobile phone
sync.
It's easy to deploy, and it sits on top of your own server's MTA.
</p><p>
I don't work for the company, nor do I sell any of its stuff, but it is a
very cool application! 
Check it out, and maybe you could do a review for your readers
(<a href="http://www.zarafa.com" target="_self">www.zarafa.com</a>).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Trent Murray  <br><br>
</p><p>
Darn it Trent, now you've given me another toy to play with! Thanks for
the tip; I'll be sure to check it out. I too have been looking for a
full-featured groupware option.&mdash;Ed.

Reader Ramblings
</h4><p>
I am a bit of a newbie to Linux, although some of my computing days go back
to systems using 12AT7 (tubes!) as memory elements. I am also a radio
amateur, as you probably can guess from my e-mail address. I have had a few
pleasant surprises since switching from the offerings coming out of
Washington state. I recently connected an ICOM 7200 to an Ubuntu box and
found the USB drivers were already present. Nice! I installed Fldigi,
changed the CI-V address on the 7200 to 6E, set Fldigi for Hamlib mode and
told it I was using an ICOM 756ProIII (there is no definition yet for the
7200), and all things worked. Try that with the competition! I could add a
few other nice things, but this letter would be a bit long. 
</p><p>
Incidentally, I
got my first copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> on a draw from the Manitoba UNIX User
Group, of which I am a member. 
</p><p>
I became rather disgusted with you know who a
few years ago, after finding that Encarta 2001 would not run under XP. It
seems XP does not maintain backward compatibility with earlier releases. I
get the impression that a certain company has the idea of releasing a new
OS version every few years, with no capability of running on anything less
than the latest hardware and then discontinue the support for the older OS, and everybody has to upgrade. $$$$! I realize that the days of the 4.77MHz
XT are long gone, but a system using a 1.5GHz Intel P4M isn't too shabby,
and a version from a well-known manufacturer apparently will have problems
with the new &ldquo;7&rdquo; when it comes out. 
</p><p>
One thing I would like to see as
a beginner is a &ldquo;newbies column&rdquo;, where those of us who are green at Linux
can learn the fundamentals of the system. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu
Kung-Fu</em></span> by Keir Thomas was
another prize and a big help to me.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gerald K. Sherman  <br><br>
</p><p>
I'm a fairly geeky guy, but I must admit you out-geeked me with Fldigi'd
Hamlibs and such! But as luck would have it, this issue's Features are all related to
Amateur Radio&mdash;hope you enjoy the articles. We try to keep the content in the magazine diverse
enough to reach everyone, but I'll admit some of the articles are even
over my head. You should check out our Web site, which has
many more articles and some helpful videos often aimed at new
users. Either way, we'll continue to try reaching all user levels in
the print magazine. If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> starts to no longer be useful and
fun, be sure to call us out!&mdash;Ed.

awk Tip
</h4><p>
This is in reference to Dave Taylor's column in the April 2009 issue on word
and letter counts. The filter used for counting occurrences of patterns on
stdin is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sort  | uniq -c
</pre>
</p><p>
I appreciate the beauty of this filter owing to its simplicity. In
practice though, I find this becoming slower and slower as the data size
increases and the cost of sorting increases. I use the following code, which
does the job extremely fast:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk ' { CNT[$0]++ }
END { for (i in CNT) print i, CNT[i] }
'
</pre>
</p><p>
One also can derive probability of occurrence easily as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
END { for (i in CNT) print i, CNT[i]/length(CNT) }
</pre>
</p><p>
I appreciate that the focus of this column is mainly on the shell, although I felt
that a
couple lines of awk is not bad for the above problem, as it avoids
sort, which can be costly at times. (I'm not sure whether the use of associative
arrays in bash would be equally compact.)

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mayuresh Warunjikar  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Good use of awk, Mayuresh. My goal is always to
show what's quick and
fast&mdash;not always what's most efficient or highest performance. Sometimes that means it
doesn't scale well, but frankly, my view of shell script programming is that most
scripts break down once you really push hard on them anyway, at which point it's
smart to rewrite it into a faster, more powerful app.

msfetch
</h4><p>
Recently, I created a tool to help sysadmins like myself&mdash;ones that
love Linux!&mdash;to be able to download their Microsoft Exchange mail using HTTP
Outlook Web Access. It downloads e-mail, formats e-mail properly to match
.mbox file format and appends additional headers. Then, you can view your
mail through the console.
Maybe it will interest some of your readers. It is absolutely free, GPLv3,
and it works very well.
See <a href="http://www.isrcomputing.com/msfetch" target="_self">www.isrcomputing.com/msfetch</a>.
Love your journal, by the way.

Neat Paul! We'll have to check it out. Thanks for the link.&mdash;Ed.

clac
</h4><p>
In &ldquo;Exploring Lat/Lon with Shell Scripts&rdquo; [November 2009], Dave Taylor writes,
&ldquo;To
accomplish any sophisticated mathematics in a Linux shell, we're pretty
much stuck with bc.&rdquo;
No! Shed your stone tools! Throw off your bc and dc chains! There is a better
way.
The clac utility is available at <a href="http://clac.sourceforge.net" target="_self">clac.sourceforge.net</a>, and
it has the following features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Handles trig, complex math, log and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports infix expressions (no Reverse Polish jokes, please).
</p></li><li><p>
Uses Python underneath (Python syntax welcome, but not required).
</p></li><li><p>
Single source file&mdash;take it where you need it.
</p></li><li><p>
User-extensible via Python: import/write the modules you want.
</p></li><li><p>
Script-friendly: expression(s) via arguments or stdin, evaluation
printed to stdout.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
clac takes expressions like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"sin(pi/4)"
"round( degrees(phase( e** ( 2j ) ) ) )"
"sum([ x**2 for x in ( $CSV ) ] )"
</pre>
</p><p>
and does what you would expect a CLI tool to do: prints out the answer
in a fraction of a second.

Closed Captioning
</h4><p>
Regarding the letter asking for transcripts of the video Tech Tips on LinuxJournal.com in the November
2009 issue: I agree that they would be pretty much useless; however, CC 
(closed captioning) would be <span   class="emphasis"><em>very useful</em></span>! Those us us who would like to watch
a very relevant and work-related video in our office without speakers and
Linux users who are hearing impaired really would
appreciate captions. Please consider adding captions to your otherwise
awesome videos. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jon Harrell  <br><br>
</p><p>
You're not the first (or second, or third, or twelfth) person to ask
for something like this. I will keep trying to figure out a way to make
closed captioning, or something similar, a feasible addition to the Tech
Tips. Perhaps we should open it up to the readership to submit CC files
to go along with the OGG videos. In fact, that's a really neat idea.
I'm glad we had this talk!&mdash;Ed.
