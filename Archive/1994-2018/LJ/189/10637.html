Should you get certified?

The past few columns, we've talked about everything from laptops
to filesystems. Our Point/Counterpoint this time around touches on a
subject somewhat less technical, but no less important. This month, we 
debate education versus experience&mdash;in today's workplace, which
carries more weight?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So the fact of the matter is, even
if you get a formal Computer Science education,
typically, you still get only a basic foundation. Most CS programs seem
to be geared more toward programming than system administration, and
even when they try to stay up to date, it's just hard to keep the academic
curriculum up to the pace of technology. When you get into the workforce,
you find you have to learn specific aspects of technology
<span   class="emphasis"><em>somehow</em></span>,
either through on-the-job training (if you can get it) or specific
certifications. Although I think Bill and I both agree that nothing can
quite beat experience, how can you get the experience if you can't get
hired? That's where things like certifications can come in.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Maybe it's me, but as a hiring manager, I gloss right over
certifications. Seriously. I give them a cursory glance, then jump right
to the experience and skills list. Certification may prove useful in
some cases, but I prefer to have people who are generalists on my staff.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I guess that was lucky for me,
because I didn't have any certs when
Bill looked over my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. I think when it comes to certifications,
it really depends on what the position is and what the certification
is. If you've been in the industry for any period of time, you 
inevitably will run into someone who has a certification but doesn't seem
to know the first thing about the topic. Does that mean the cert is bad?
Not necessarily. It just highlights how difficult it is to force someone
actually to learn material rather than cram information long enough to
pass a test.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Exactly. I have seen
&ldquo;certified&rdquo; people who couldn't administer
their way out of a paper bag. I've seen Cisco-certified people who have no
understanding of DNS, for example. Kyle's point is well taken&mdash;a cert may be just an indicator of a person who can cram and test well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think formal training really comes in handy when
you need to get ramped up on technology that has a high cost of entry
(for instance, some enterprise virtualization products or SAN
infrastructure). Most people don't have the funds to buy a bunch of
expensive SAN gear or software licenses so they can build up experience
at home. In those cases, formal training can be a good way to kickstart
people onto a technology before they actually have to deploy it. I've
also seen it come in handy when you hire people who have experience in 90%
of what you need. Getting them formal training or certification can be
a quick way to ramp them up on the remaining 10%, so they can learn the
rest on the job.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Kyle, you're a bad example. When I hired you, I'd already known
you for some time and had a good idea what you were capable of. However,
there's another employee I hired without certs and much experience, but
based on his r&eacute;sum&eacute; I gave him a shot at an interview, and he knocked me
out. He ended up rounding out our team quite nicely, and we had a good,
successful run for quite some time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think this is one of those rare times when it's a good thing to
be a bad example.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Your point about getting certified in expensive technology is
well taken; however, I remember a certain bloke who had no formal SAN
training and did quite well for a long time administering, and later
architecting, an EMC SAN solution. I'm of the opinion that good
generalists, with a good head on their shoulders and a solid thought
process and troubleshooting methodology can figure anything out. I've
watched many seasoned &ldquo;certified&rdquo; technicians lock up when they are
forced into uncharted waters by some esoteric issue.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Heh, well I think that guy was lucky to have a good work
environment to get up to speed. I have to agree with Bill that when
I see certifications on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I always take them with a grain of
salt. Trust but verify. That's why most technology positions have some
sort of technical vetting process&mdash;a certification might get you in the
door, but you still have to prove you know your stuff once you get there.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That guy also was lucky to have a manager who valued a good
work environment. But I digress on that. Back to the topic, a good
technical interview is a great vetting process, and one that I live by.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think the same thing goes for most education. It really depends
on how you approach it. If you look at a cert as a quick way to get
a piece of paper and get a job, you will miss out. On the other hand,
if you actually use it as an opportunity to learn and remember some new
technology, especially if you couple it with plenty of actual experience,
I think it can be very valuable. You know, we've gone this whole time
without specifically mentioning Linux certs. What do you think of
those, Bill?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I put less stock in them in general.
It shows me people were
interested enough to get the cert, but that really doesn't give
me a clue as to their abilities. I'd much rather see a list of skills
and accomplishments, and then ask people about the most interesting
thing they've done in the last six months, either via a phone interview
or in person. Hearing people get excited about technology they've
grappled with and been successful with gives me an idea of how vested
they are in their job.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think I agree with you here. I actually think sometimes some Linux
certs can hurt. Unlike with other certifications,
there's nothing really stopping anyone from building their own Linux
network and learning at home. When it comes to Linux knowledge, I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span>
put equal stock in personal and professional experience, and those are
the most important things to me besides just having a good fundamental
knowledge of Linux, networking and so on. The challenge with Linux certs
is that Linux is a fast-moving technology. Not to single anyone out,
but as an example, the LPIC cert still had IRQ settings as a fundamental
part of the curriculum until recently. I can't remember the last time
I needed to tweak that. To their credit, this spring the entire course
was revamped, and now it more accurately reflects what you would need
to know on a modern Linux system. It's actually a good course now as
a result. It shows though that if you are shopping around for Linux
certs, be sure to check the last time the course was updated.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That's a good point. Often the curriculum will lag behind
the current technology, particularly when dealing with open-source
technologies, such as Linux. Other OSS technologies also suffer from
this as well, which is another reason why I'm an advocate of staying on
top of technology yourself.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> To summarize, I think (and I think Bill will mostly agree with me
here) that certifications can be a good way to get ramped up on a new
technology, but they are no substitute for actual experience. Not all
certs are equal. Do research on how frequently they are updated,
and if you do take formal training, don't just cram to pass a test. Use
the class as a catalyst to learn the technology in a way that you will
remember far after the test is over.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> You can't go wrong with experience.
Certs don't hurt, but in my book,
they don't add as much value as many people think. Experience, a solid grounding
in the fundamentals, a great work ethic and excitement about what you're
doing are things I look for when I'm hiring a new employee. Unless you
want to be something very specialized, certs are a minor differentiator
in my book. I'd rather hire someone who's active in a LUG, contributes
to projects like Fedora or Ubuntu and has some track record in the
community. If you've contributed and been active in open source, you
rate higher on my &ldquo;hiring manager&rdquo; radar than someone who's attended a
lot of courses.
