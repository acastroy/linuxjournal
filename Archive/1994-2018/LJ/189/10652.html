&ldquo;When all else fails&rdquo;&mdash;in 2003, the Amateur Radio Relay League used this as
the motto for Field Day, the annual demonstration of its capabilities to the
public. It rapidly became the touch phrase for the Amateur Radio Emergency
Service&mdash;probably the most public of all aspects of Amateur Radio and
the operators that are usually first to respond in an emergency. To me, it
also is the quintessential definition of open source. When
something is missing in a commercial system, we look to open source for the
solution. A better operating system? A better management platform? How
about a better ERP system? Open source has become the answer. But, what
about a better communications system? When we think <span   class="emphasis"><em>open
source</em></span>,
our minds naturally turn to software, usually *NIX-based, running on Linux.
What most people tend not to think about is the open-source nature of
Amateur Radio. While operators most often are seen working in emergency
situations, many of the modern conveniences we have today&mdash;cell
phones,
satellites, wireless devices&mdash;were developed and tested by radio
amateurs.
</p><p>
What's Amateur Radio? Have you heard of ham radio? It's the same thing.
Although some revel in the term, get a group of operators
together, and you will find more stories for the origins of the term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ham
radio</em></span> than operators. But,
because the Federal Communications Commission calls us Amateurs Radio
operators, we should call ourselves that too. Of course, this is not
amateur in the rookie sense of the term, but in the non-pecuniary sense. Many consider us communication professionals.
</p><p>
Amateur Radio has been around almost since Marconi invented the
thing&mdash;hmm, was Marconi a ham? Feel free to discuss that among
yourselves. Early on, Marconi's invention was put to the test, and ever
since, when disaster strikes, Amateur Radio operators have been some of the
first to respond, providing communications support when there is little or
no communications infrastructure. Before we can talk about it, however, we need
some basic language, and like most technologies, Amateur Radio has a
language all its own. This month, Dan Smith gets us started by explaining
some of the shorthand we use.
</p><p>
Suppose I want to send data from one point to another without a wire
between them? Shawn just passed me an 802.11a/b/g/n device, and we are off
to the races, right? But, what if there is no network to plug it in to? Gary
Robinson shows us how to pass data without an 802.11a/b/g/n
device using your PC, Fldigi and an Amateur Radio transceiver. This is one
of the ways that FEMA and other aid agencies send supply lists, like how
many cell towers need to be brought into an area during the early stages of
an emergency when the only ones passing messages are the Amateurs.
</p><p>
Got a GPS? How about 30,000 runners, more than half of whom will not make
it to the end of the marathon, whether it is the Seattle, Boston, New York
or Marine Corps Marathons? Using Xastir, an open-source version of APRS, a
GPS and a rig, you can tell where the straggler bus is to pick up the
runners who do not finish. You will find Amateur
Radio operators at each of these marathons providing communications
support. Curt Mills, Steve Stroh and Laura Mills take us through
setting up and configuring Xastir so you can use it at your next event.
</p><p>
This month, however, we are not all about Amateur Radio. Dave Taylor 
tells us how to automate Twitter feed responses with a command-line bot
(which begs the question, how many of Dave's responses are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
automated?). Over at the forge, Reuven puts down his mallet and introduces
us to Cucumber, an integration testing framework for Ruby, complete with
vegetable jokes.
</p><p>
It looks like Kyle Rankin needs to buy a vowel as Dr hjkl dives into the
Vimperator. (Sounds like what I did with my Christmas turkey, actually.) But
seriously, I think Kyle has it in for the humble mouse as he shows you how
to browse in Firefox using your keyboard.
</p><p>
We also have a security roundup, starting with Mick Bauer's discussion of
the potential threats for the new year. Dirk Elmendorf tackles
security from the amateur position (think Amateur Radio, not rookie). And,
just to make sure you have all the security tools we can give you, Vadim
Kurland describes what is new in Firewall Builder 3.0.
Finally, Federico Kereki helps us implement some
port-knocking security with knockd, and Doc Searls has the last word,
opining on the control of one's personal data.
</p><p>
2010 is going to be another big year for virtualization, and Matthew
Hoskins dives into
virtual appliances with Xen on Linux. I can think of several projects for this technology already!
</p><p>
Whew, it's a jam-packed issue! Whether or not you are an Amateur, there is
something in here for everyone. If you are interested in becoming an

David A. Lane, KG4GIY, has been licensed as an Amateur Radio operator since
2000 and has been working with Linux since 1995. During the day, he is an
Infrastructure Architect. During an emergency, he is an Emergency
Coordinator for Prince William County ARES. And on weekends, he makes pasta!
