<span   class="emphasis"><em>Danger from the Deep</em></span>
(<a href="http://dangerdeep.sourceforge.net" target="_self">dangerdeep.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you remember last month's column, I was excited about a particularly
cool-looking submarine simulator, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Danger from the Deep</em></span>. 
This month, I'm proud to feature it as one of the main projects. According to
its Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Danger from the Deep</em></span> (known as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dangerdeep</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>DftD</em></span>) is a free (as
in free speech), open-source World War II German submarine simulator....This game is planned as tactical simulation and will be as realistic
as our time and knowledge of physics allows. Its current state is alpha,
but it is playable.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DftD</em></span> currently is being developed on Linux (i386 and AMD64) and
Windows. There are binaries available for Linux (i386 and AMD64) and Windows
(32-bit), and there are some old packages for Mac OS X. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Danger
from the Deep</em></span>
makes use of SDL/OpenGL and, thus, should be portable to other operating
systems or platforms.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DftD</em></span> has even been reported to work on Windows (2000/XP/98), Linux
(i386/x86-64/SPARC64) and FreeBSD (x86-64/SPARC64/IA64).
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f1.large.jpg"><img src="10635f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Authenticity and romance are almost taken to extremes here, and
touches like these captain's quarters really help you get into
the feeling and atmosphere of the game.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f2.large.jpg"><img src="10635f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Ah, authenticity! Don't speak German? Too bad! The controls stay that
way, whether you like it or not (which I do).
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f3.large.jpg"><img src="10635f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Sometimes the environment can be quite beautiful, such as this sunset, 
which makes long hours in a sub much easier to bear!
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
In terms of hardware requirements, you'll need the following: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An OpenGL 1.5-compliant graphics card (OpenGL 2.0 or greater is
recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
A fairly fast CPU (anything from 1.0GHz up should be okay).
</p></li><li><p>
256MB RAM (512MB is recommended).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The Web site provides a lovely binary installer that feels much
like that of a commercial game. You can compile the game from source if
you want, but would you really do that when you can simply click
Next, Next, Next?
</p><p>
The binary installer runs most things by itself, but as is the usual
way with these things, you need to flag it as executable. If you're
running this through a file manager, you probably need to right-click
and choose executable in whatever properties section is available,
but I'll leave this part up to you. For those who prefer to run things
from the command line, you can flag it as executable with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+x dangerdeep-0.3.0-linux-installer.bin
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, run the installer with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./dangerdeep-0.3.0-linux-installer.bin
</pre>
</p><p>
(Note: do this as root or sudo if you're installing it
system-wide.)
</p><p>
The installer will go through the usual Next, Next, Next...Finish process,
and once it's done, you can run the game with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dangerdeep
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As soon as you're at the main screen, you'll be flooded by a wave of
romantic nostalgia that never lets up! From the sepia-colored menus,
German-labeled controls and wartime background imagery to the
crackly WWII-era music, this game wears its heart on its sleeve.
</p><p>
Assuming you have a decent graphics card, you'll want to crank up the
video resolution in the Options menu, as the graphics in this game
actually are quite impressive at times.
</p><p>
Because this game is currently in alpha stage, the number of gaming options
are limited. Nevertheless, several kinds of missions are available
in single-player mode. For those wanting something to blast at from the
get-go, try Historical Mission first under the menu Play single mission.
</p><p>
Before you embark on any voyages, however, I suggest that you print
out the game's PDF manual, which is downloadable at the Web site. This
game's controls are extensive (hey, you're piloting a
submarine), and each key often is assigned to something different between
other view modes. Here are a few basic universal controls to get
you started though.
</p><p>
F1 through F12 all have a different view or function on the
ship. Some keys bring you to actual locations within the submarine, such
as the torpedo room or captain's quarters, and others bring up equipment,
such as the ship's sonar. Of particular joy and amusement is the control
screen on F1 and the torpedo screen on F6. The gauges and dials are in
German, and as far as I know, there's no option to have them in English,
so you'll have to find out what <span   class="emphasis"><em>HalbeFarht</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lagenwinkel</em></span> mean on your
own. 
</p><p>
Now, I'm sure at this stage you'll be keen to blast at something, so
let's cover that. You may want to try surfacing for this, as
it makes the above-water enemies easier to spot using more
view modes, but it also shows off some of the cool graphics this game has.
</p><p>
Press the S key to surface, and when you're up there, have a look
around with various different view modes (check out that deck
for starters, and, yes, you can man that surface gun). If a target is
somewhere in sight, press I to identify the target. Pressing the spacebar
selects it,
and T fires a torpedo.
</p><p>
I could go on and on,
but it's been a privilege to see a project with such polish and passion
as this one. In the hands of your average open-source team, a submarine
simulator like this could be a bland, grey, blobby mess, and spending
several hours with it might be a guaranteed cure for insomnia. This, on the
other hand, is a colorful world of fine touches and authenticity that's
guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.
</p><p>
Considering this game is in the alpha stage, it's an extraordinary
effort with nice graphics, a brilliant installer
and even a small soundtrack! Submarine buffs, do yourself a favor,
and check out this game.

Flinks&mdash;Speed-Reading Web Browser	
(<a href="http://mbays.freeshell.org/flinks" target="_self">mbays.freeshell.org/flinks</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I'm always on the lookout for original projects, and this particular
application really took me by surprise. According to its Web site,
&ldquo;Flinks is a text-mode flashing word Web browser. It is intended for
speed reading and/or skimming Web pages and text.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Martin Bays, the author of the project, was first inspired by a mobile-phone program
that rapidly flashed words one after the other on screen, which promised
reading speeds of 600&ndash;700 words per minute (WPM) after a few days of
practice. Intrigued by the idea and put off by the thought that such a
technically simple program cost $20, Martin set about making Flinks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f4.large.jpg"><img src="10635f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Although I can't really demonstrate the effect on printed page, Flinks
rapidly flashes individual words of a Web page one after the other in
rapid succession to help train your brain for speed reading.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Getting Flinks up and running is very easy, because no real
installation is necessary, and its dependencies are very minimal. All
you need is Python, version 2.4 or later, along with a working version
of Lynx.
</p><p>
Download the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open
a terminal in the new folder. At the command line, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./flinks
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Given the simple design, Flinks is best used with Web sites
consisting of mostly text and easy navigation. A good example of this is
Wikipedia, and as a result, Martin has chosen it as the default Web site
upon opening Flinks.
</p><p>
To get going, press the g key to enter a URL (you don't have to enter
in the &ldquo;http://&rdquo;, something like &ldquo;metallica.com&rdquo; is
fine). Once the page loads for a few seconds in the browser,
press the spacebar to &ldquo;play&rdquo; the Web page. Pressing the
spacebar again will pause
the browser. At this point, a great deal of words starts flying at
you, one after the other at a rapid speed. The effect is kind of
startling at first but pretty darn cool.
</p><p>
Flinks is set to a default speed of 450 WPM, but if you want to speed 
up or slow down the word rate, the up and down arrow keys adjust it
accordingly. The left and right arrow keys allow you to skip through sentences,
and the / or ? keys let you search forward or backward within the
text. Other basic navigation includes b to go back, u to go
&ldquo;unback&rdquo;
and q to quit the program.
</p><p>
In the end, this program is a great trip. Put on some Speed
Garage (or conversely some Stoner/Prog rock for a time-warp effect)
in the background while you try reading at 700 WPM, and you'll be in
hyperspeed geek heaven. And, to quote Martin himself:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
But perhaps the most important plus of using Flinks is that having
this almost direct jack from the computer to my brain makes me feel
like I'm living in the future. And the future is in text mode, just as
I always dreamed it would be.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Sounds good to me.

RedNotebook&mdash;Advanced Diary Keeping
(<a href="http://digitaldump.wordpress.com/projects/rednotebook" target="_self">digitaldump.wordpress.com/projects/rednotebook</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, this month, we have RedNotebook, a nifty little diary
application. According to its Web site: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
RedNotebook is
a graphical diary and journal helping you keep track of notes and
thoughts. It includes calendar navigation, customizable templates,
export functionality and word clouds. You also can format, tag and search
your entries.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
RedNotebook's many features include the
ability to add text, images or links to any day within the excellent
calendar navigation; backup utilities; HTML exportation&mdash;the list
goes on.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f5.large.jpg"><img src="10635f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
RedNotebook lets you keep a daily journal with organizational
categories, multimedia attachments and more.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10635f6.large.jpg"><img src="10635f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
RedNotebook has some unique organizational structures and search
functions, such as its unique cloud interface.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing RedNotebook from source is quite easy, but
there also are a number of different binaries available, so you might
want to check those first on the Downloads page. In terms of library
requirements, you'll need Python (2.5/2.6), PyYaml (&gt;=3.05) and PyGTK
(&gt;=2.13). Depending on your distro, package names will be something
along the lines of python, python-yaml and python-devel.
</p><p>
If you're going with the source, download the latest tarball from
the Web site, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder.
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
If not:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
If Lady Luck is smiling, an entry for RedNotebook may appear in your main menu
in the Office section.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
When RedNotebook starts, you should be at today's
date on the calendar automatically. You can attach journal entries to each
day on the calendar,
and you can have text along with pictures, links
and so on. Near the top right is the New Entry button. Click that,
and you'll be presented with a small window with two fields. The first is
to select or create a category (such as Todo, Cool Stuff and so on),
and the second is for naming your entry.
</p><p>
Once this is done, the big pane in the center of the window is where
you enter text and other material. Write the text for today, and in
the top row of buttons is Insert. Use this to add any images, links,
formatting or for numerous other options. During the editing process,
you'll see each attachment only as bracketed text, but if you click
Preview, you can see your work in progress. When you're done, click Save
under the Journal menu, and you can create or browse any other
journal entries on the calendar and come back to your entry
at any time.
</p><p>
Also, well worth looking at are the Search and Clouds sections,
which make navigating through your old entries easy and may
save you some headaches in the future. There are many more features
that are worth covering (especially the ability to encrypt journals),
but I'm afraid I'm well out of space for this month!
</p><p>
Overall, this is an intuitive program with an easy installation that
should appeal to someone looking for a good journal program that's both
well designed and easy to use.
