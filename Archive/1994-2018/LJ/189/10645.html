The main problem with data is that it's easy to copy. In fact, sending it
from one place to another is essentially an act of replication. The mv
command is alien to most people's experience of the Internet. They may
use it every day (hardly realizing it) within their own filesystems,
but between separate systems on the Net, their experience is that of
replication, not relocation.
</p><p>
This alone makes control of one's data problematic, especially when
the first-person possessive voice isn't quite right. &ldquo;My&rdquo; data often
isn't. For example, take profile or activity data kept by a service
provider. It's from you and about you, but you don't own it, much
less control it. Transaction data is created by a buyer and a seller
together, but the canonical form of the data is what's kept by the
seller and provided (by copying) in the form of a bill or displayed
on an encrypted personal Web connection. Sellers don't go much
further than that. The idea of sharing that information in its raw
form, either during a transaction or later on request by the buyer,
is alien at best to most sellers' IT and legal departments. As John
Perry Barlow put it in &ldquo;Death From Above&rdquo; (way back in 1995,
<a href="http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/death_from_above.html" target="_self">w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/death_from_above.html</a>),
&ldquo;America remains a place where companies produce and consumers consume
in an economic relationship which is still as asymmetrical as that of
bomber to bombee.&rdquo; In fact, this is still true of the whole business world.
</p><p>
Yet, internetworking of that world brings a great deal of symmetricality
to it, imposed by the architecture of the Internet and its growing
suite of protocols. The bank that used to occupy the most serious
building on Main Street&mdash;or a skyscraper in a big city&mdash;is
now but one location among a trillion on the Web. Yours is another.
The word &ldquo;domain&rdquo; applies to both of you, even if your bank's
&ldquo;brand&rdquo;
is bigger than yours. Of your own sense of place and power on the Net,
the words of William Cowper apply (<a href="http://www.bartelby.com/41/317.html" target="_self">www.bartelby.com/41/317.html</a>):
&ldquo;I AM monarch of all I survey; / My right there is none to
dispute...&rdquo;
</p><p>
Yet, as William Gibson famously said, &ldquo;the future is here but not
evenly distributed.&rdquo; Bomber/bombee power asymmetries persist in the
B2C (business-to-consumer) world of everyday retailing. When you buy
something, the transaction data in most cases comes to you only in
the form of a receipt from the seller and a bill from the credit-card
company. Neither is offered in formats that allow you to gather data
on the spot or later over a secure Net connection&mdash;not easily, anyway.
</p><p>
If we could collect that data easily, our self-knowledge and future
purchases would be far better informed. In fact, collected data could
go far beyond transaction alone. Time, date, location, duration,
sequence&mdash;those are obvious ones. How about other bits of data, such
as those involved in dealings with airlines? For example, your &ldquo;fare
basis code&rdquo; (HL7LNR, or some other collection of letters and numbers)
contains piles of information that might be useful to you as well as
the airline, especially as you begin to add up the variables over time.
</p><p>
A marketplace is no better than the knowledge and practices that buyers
and sellers both bring to it. But, while the Net opens many paths for
increasing knowledge on both sides, most of the knowledge-gathering
innovation has gone into helping sellers. Not buyers.
</p><p>
Today, that's changing. More and more buyers (especially the geeks among
them) are getting around to helping themselves. In particular, two new
development categories are starting to stand out&mdash;at least for me. One
is self-tracking, and the other is personal informatics.
</p><p>
Compared to its alternative (basically, guessing), self-tracking is
&ldquo;know thyself&rdquo; taken to an extreme. Alexandra Carmichael, for example,
tracks 40 things about herself, every day. These include mood, chronic
pain levels, sexual activity, food intake and so on. She's a star in the
Quantified Self community (<a href="http://www.kk.org/quantifiedself" target="_self">www.kk.org/quantifiedself</a>), which is
led by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly. Among topics at QS meetups are chemical
body load, personal genome sequencing, lifelogging, self-experimentation,
behavior monitoring, location tracking, non-invasive probes, digitizing
body info, sharing health records, psychological self-assessments and
medical self-diagnostics, to name a few.
</p><p>
Now, would any of these be extreme if they were
easy and routine? Well, that's the idea. ListenLog
(<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/ListenLog" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/ListenLog</a>), one of the projects
I'm involved with, doesn't make sense unless it's easy, and unless the
data it yields is plainly valuable.
</p><p>
This brings us to personal informatics, which is a general category that
includes self-tracking and extends to actions. All this data needs to
live somewhere, and stuff needs to be done with it.
</p><p>
In the commercial realm, I see two broad but different approaches. One
is based on a personal data store that might be self-hosted by the
customer or in a cloud operated by what we call a fourth-party service
(serving the buyer rather than the seller&mdash;to differentiate it from
third parties, which primarily serve sellers). As Iain Henderson
(who leads this approach) puts it, what matters here &ldquo;is what the
individual brings to the party via their personal data store/user-driven and volunteered personal information. They bring the context
for all subsequent components of the buying process (and high-grade
fuel for the selling process if it can be trained to listen rather
than shout).&rdquo; The other approach is based on complete user autonomy,
whereby self-tracking and personal relationships are entirely the
responsibility of the individual. This is exemplified by The Mine! Project
(<a href="http://themineproject.org/about" target="_self">themineproject.org/about</a>), led by Adriana Lukas. As she puts
it, the difference between the two approaches is providing vs. enabling
(<a href="http://www.mediainfluencer.net/2009/04/enabling-vs-providing" target="_self">www.mediainfluencer.net/2009/04/enabling-vs-providing</a>).
</p><p>
Either way, the individual is the primary actor. As distribution of the
future evens out, the individual has the most to gain.
