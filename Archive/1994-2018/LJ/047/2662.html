    One of the strengths of Linux is its ability to serve both as
    engine for powerful number-crunchers and as effective support for
    minimal computer systems. The PLIP implementation is an outstanding
    resource in the latter realm, and this article shows its
    internals at the software level.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2887450"></a></h2></div></div><p>PLIP means &ldquo;Parallel Line Internet
Protocol&rdquo;. It is a protocol used to bring IP traffic over a
parallel cable. It works with any parallel interface and is able to
transfer about 40KB per second. With PLIP you can connect any two
computers at virtually no cost. Although nowadays ISA network cards
are readily found and installed, you will still enjoy PLIP as soon
as you get a laptop, unless you can afford a PCMCIA network card.
</p><p>PLIP allows you to connect your computer to the Internet
wherever there is a networked Linux box with a parallel port
available, as long as you have root access on both systems (only
root can load a module or configure an interface).</p><p>I find the internal design of PLIP quite interesting on three
levels:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It shows how to use simple I/O instructions.</p></li><li><p>It lets you look at how network interfaces fit in
the overall kernel.</p></li><li><p>It shows in practice how kernel software uses the
task queues.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2887870"></a>Hardware Handling</h2></div></div><p>Before showing any PLIP code, I'd like to describe the
workings of the standard parallel port, so that you'll be able to
understand how the actual data transfer takes place.</p><p>The parallel port is a simple device; its external connector
exposes 12 output bits and 5 input bits. Software has direct access
to the bits by means of three 8-bit ports: two ports for writing
and one for reading. Moreover, one of the input signals can trigger
an interrupt; this ability is enabled by setting a bit in one of
the output ports. Figure 1 shows how the three ports are mapped to
the 25-pin connector. The <b  >base_addr</b> of a
parallel port (the address of its data port) is usually 0x378,
0x278 or 0x3bc. The vast majority of the parallel ports uses
0x378.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2662f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mapping of Three Ports to Connector
</p></div></div><p>Physical access to the ports is achieved by calling two
C-language functions defined in the kernel headers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/io.h&gt;
unsigned char inb(unsigned short port);
void outb(unsigned char value, unsigned short port);
</pre><p>The &ldquo;b&rdquo; in the function name means &ldquo;byte&rdquo;. Linux also
offers <span   class="emphasis"><em>inw</em></span> (word, 16-bit),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inl</em></span> (long, 32-bit) and their output
counterparts, but they are not needed to use the parallel port. The
functions just shown are in fact macros, and they expand to a
single machine instruction on most Linux platforms. Their
definition relies on <span   class="emphasis"><em>extern inline</em></span> functions;
this means you must turn optimization on when compiling any code
using them. The reason behind this is somehow technical, and it is
well explained in the gcc man page.
</p><p>You don't need to be in kernel space to call
<span   class="bold"><b>inb</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>outb</b></span>. If you want to access I/O
ports from a shell script, you can compile inp.c and outp.c and
play games with your devices (and even destroy the computer). For
this reason, only root can access ports. The source code for inp.c
and outp.c is available by anonymous download in the file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/lj/listings/issue47/2662.tgz.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2887ef8"></a>Communicating</h2></div></div><p>Based on the description of the parallel port I provided in
the previous section, it should be clear that two parties that
communicate using PLIP must exchange five bits at a time, at most.
The PLIP cable must be specially wired in order to connect five of
the outputs of one side to the five inputs at the other side, and
vice-versa. The exact pin out of the PLIP cable is described in the
source file drivers/net/plip.c and in several places elsewhere, so
I won't repeat the information here.</p><p>One of the deficiencies of the parallel port is the
unavailability of any timing resources in hardware. Compare this
with the serial port which contains its own clock. The
communication protocol can't exploit any advanced hardware
functionality, and any handshake must be performed in software. The
chosen protocol uses one of the bits as a strobe signal to signal
the availability of four data bits; the receiver must acknowledge
receipt of the data by toggling its own strobe line. This approach
to data transmission is very CPU intensive. The processor must poll
the strobe signal to send its data, and system performance degrades
severely during PLIP data transfers.</p><p>The time line of a PLIP transmission is depicted in Figure 2,
which details the steps involved in the transmission of a single
byte of information.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2662f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Time Line of PLIP Transmission
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2888268"></a>Internet Datagrams</h2></div></div><p>As far as the kernel proper is concerned, the PLIP device is
just like any other network device. More specifically, it is like
any other Ethernet interface even though its name is
<span   class="bold"><b>plip</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> instead
of
<span   class="bold"><b>eth</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.</p><p>When a datagram must be transmitted through a network
interface, it is passed to the transmission function of the device
driver. The driver receives a socket-buffer argument
(<b  >struct sk_buff</b>) and a pointer to itself
(<b  >struct device</b>).</p><p>With PLIP, transmission occurs by encapsulating the IP
datagram into a &ldquo;hardware header&rdquo; for delivery, not unlike what
happens for any other transmission medium. The difference with PLIP
is that although it receives a data packet that already includes an
Ethernet header, the driver adds its own header. A packet
encapsulated by PLIP, as it travels over the parallel cable, is
made up of the following fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Packet length</b></span>:
Transmission is headed by the length of the data packet in bytes,
least significant byte first. The count is transmitted as a 16-bit
number that doesn't include the count itself or the final checksum
byte.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ethernet header</b></span>:
PLIP uses Ethernet encapsulation, so that programming the first
implementation (in the PC world, when Linux didn't exist) was
simplified. These fourteen bytes are almost useless, but they are
still present for backward compatibility.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>IP data</b></span>: IP data
directly follow the header, just as with Ethernet
interfaces.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Checksum byte</b></span>: The
trailing byte of a PLIP transmission is a checksum byte, which must
equal the sum modulo 256 of every data byte in the packet,
excluding the leading two bytes (the length) and the checksum
itself.</p></li></ul></div><p>Whenever a packet is transmitted, all of the bytes are sent
through the cable using the 5-bit protocol described earlier. This
is quite straightforward and works flawlessly, unless something
goes haywire during transmission.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2888b00"></a>Asynchronous Operation</h2></div></div><p>The interesting part of a PLIP communication channel is how
asynchronous operations are handled. Transmission and reception of
data packets must fit with other system operations and must be
fault tolerant as much as possible. This involves several kernel
resources and is quite interesting to anyone interested in kernel
internals.</p><p>There are three problems to overcome to achieve reliable PLIP
transmission. Outgoing packets must be transmitted asynchronously
with respect to the rest of the system; even if transmission is CPU
bound, it should happen outside of the normal computational flow.
Incoming packets must also be received asynchronously, and they
must be able to notify the PLIP device driver about their arrival.
The last problem is fault tolerance; if one of the parties locks up
transmission for any reason, we don't want the peer host to freeze
while it waits for a strobe signal.</p><p>Asynchronous operation is achieved in PLIP by using the
kernel task queues (which were introduced in the June 1996 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>). Fault tolerance and timeouts
are implemented using a state-machine implementation that
interleaves PLIP transmission/reception with other computational
activities without losing track of the internal status of the
transmitter.</p><p>Let's look at PLIP cable connecting machines called Tanino
and Romeo (Tanino = Tx, Romeo = Rx). The following paragraphs
explain what happens when Tanino sends a packet to Romeo.</p><p>Tanino sends the signal to interrupt Romeo, disables
interrupt reporting for itself and initiates the transmission loop
by registering <span   class="bold"><b>plip_bh</b></span> in the
immediate task queue and returning. When plip_bh runs, it knows
that the interface is sending data and calls
<span   class="bold"><b>plip_send_packet</b></span>.</p><p>Romeo, when interrupted
(<span   class="bold"><b>plip_interrupt</b></span>), registers
plip_bh in the immediate task queue. The plip_bh function
dispatches computation to
<span   class="bold"><b>plip_receive_packet</b></span>, which
disables interrupt reporting in the interface and starts receiving
bytes.</p><p>Tanino's loop is built on
<span   class="bold"><b>plip_send</b></span> (which transmits a
single byte) while Romeo's loop is built on
<span   class="bold"><b>plip_receive</b></span> (which receives a
single byte). These two functions are ready to detect a timeout
condition, and in this case, they return the TIMEOUT macro to the
calling function, which returns TIMEOUT to plip_bh.</p><p>When the callee aborts the loop by returning TIMEOUT, the
plip_bh function registers a function in the timer task queue, so
that the loop will be entered again at the next clock tick. If
timeout continues after a few clock ticks, transmission or
reception of this packet is aborted, and an error is registered in
the <span   class="bold"><b>enet_statistics</b></span> structure;
these errors are shown by the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command.</p><p>If the timeout condition doesn't persist at the next clock
tick, data exchange goes on flawlessly. The state machine
implemented in the interface is responsible for restarting
communication at exactly the place where the timeout
occurred.</p><p>As you see, the PLIP interface is fairly symmetrical.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2c81488"></a>Plugging the Driver in Linux</h2></div></div><p>As far as a network driver is concerned, being able to
transmit and receive data is not the whole of its job. The driver
needs to interface with the rest of the kernel in order to fit with
the rest of the system. The PLIP device driver devotes more or less
one quarter of its source code to interface issues, and I feel it
worth introducing here.</p><p>Basically, a network interface needs to be able to send and
receive packets. Network drivers are organized into a set of
&ldquo;methods&rdquo;, as character drivers are (see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic
Kernels: Discovery</em></span>, <i  >LJ</i> April 1996).
Sending a packet is easy; one of the methods is dedicated to packet
transmission, and the driver just implements the right method to
transmit data to the network.</p><p>Receiving a packet is somehow more difficult, as the packet
arrives through an interrupt, and the driver must actively manage
received data. Packet reception for any network interface is
managed by exploiting the so-called &ldquo;bottom halves&rdquo;.</p><p>In Linux, interrupt handling code is split into two halves.
The top half is the hardware interrupt, which is triggered by a
hardware event and is executed immediately. The bottom half is a
software routine that gets scheduled by the kernel to run without
interfering with normal system operation. Bottom halves are run
whenever a process returns from a system call and when &ldquo;slow&rdquo;
interrupt handlers return. When a slow handler runs, all of the
processor registers are saved and hardware interrupts are not
disabled; therefore, it's safe to run the pending bottom halves
when such handlers return. It's interesting to note that new
kernels in the 2.1 hierarchy no longer differentiate between fast
and slow interrupt handlers.</p><p>A bottom-half handler must be &ldquo;marked&rdquo;; this consists of
setting a bit in a bit-mask register, so that the kernel will check
whether any bottom half is pending or not. The immediate task
queue, used by the PLIP driver, is implemented as a bottom half.
When a task is queued, the caller must call
<b  >mark_bh(IMMEDIATE_BH)</b>, and the queue will be run
as soon as a process is done with a system call or a slow handler
returns.</p><p>Getting back to network interfaces, when a driver receives a
network datagram, it must make the following call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
netif_rx(struct sk_buff *skb)
</pre><p>where <b  >skb</b> is the buffer hosting the
received packet; PLIP calls
<span   class="bold"><b>netif_rx</b></span> from plip_receive_packet.
The netif_rx function queues the packet for later processing and
calls:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mark_bh(NET_BH)
</pre>


Then, when bottom halves are run, the packet is processed.
</p><p>In practice, something more is needed to fit a network
interface into the Linux kernel; the module must register its own
interfaces and initialize them. Moreover, an interface must export
a few house-keeping functions that the kernel will call. All of
this is performed by a few short functions, listed below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_init</b></span>: This
function is in charge of initializing the network device; it is
called when <span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span> registers
its devices. The function checks to see if the hardware is
installed in the system and assigns fields in the <b  >struct
device</b> that describes the interface.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_open</b></span>:
Whenever an interface is brought up, its
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> function is called by the
kernel. The function must prepare to become operative (similar to
the <span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> method for character
devices).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_close</b></span>: This
function is the reverse of plip_open.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_get_stats</b></span>:
This function is called whenever statistical information is needed.
For example, the printout of
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> shows values returned by
this function.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_config</b></span>: If a
program changes the hardware configuration of the device, this
function is called. PLIP allows you to specify the interrupt line
at run time, because probing can't be safely performed when a
module is loaded. Most of the parallel ports are configured to use
the default interrupt line.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_ioctl</b></span>: Any
interface that needs to implement device-specific
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> commands must have an ioctl
method. PLIP allows changing its timeout values, although I never
needed to play with these numbers. The
<span   class="bold"><b>plipconfig</b></span> program allows changing
the timeouts.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>plip_rebuild_header</b></span>:
This function is used to build an Ethernet header in front of the
IP data. Ethernet interfaces that use ARP don't need to implement
this function, as the default one for the Ethernet interface does
all of the work.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span>: As
you probably already know, this is the entry point to the
modularized driver. When a network interface is loaded to a running
system, its <span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span> should
call <span   class="bold"><b>register_netdev</b></span>, passing a
pointer to <span   class="bold"><b>struct device</b></span>. Such a
structure should be partly initialized and should include a pointer
to an <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> function which
completes initialization of the structure. For PLIP, such a
function is plip_init.</p></li></ul></div><p>These functions, along with
<span   class="bold"><b>hw_start_xmit</b></span>, the one function
responsible for actual packet transmission, are all that's needed
to run a network interface within Linux. Although I admit there's
more to know in order to write a real driver, I hope the actual
sources can prove interesting to fill the holes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x278f580.0x2c82770"></a>More Information</h2></div></div><p>My choice to discuss PLIP is motivated by the easy
availability of such a network connection, and the do-it-yourself
approach that might convince someone to build their own infrared
Ethernet link. If you really are going to peek in the sources to
learn how a network interface works, I'd suggest starting with
loopback.c, which implements the <span   class="bold"><b>o</b></span>
interface, and skeleton.c, which is quite detailed about the
problems you'll encounter when building a network driver.</p><p>If you are more keen to use PLIP than to write device
drivers, you can refer to the PLIP-HOWTO in any LDP mirror, and to
/usr/doc/HOWTO in most Linux installations.</p></div></div>
