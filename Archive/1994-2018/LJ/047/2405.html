    GPIB is a standard bus used in laboratory and industry data

The technology is changing daily, and anyone involved with system
administration should try to keep up with it at any cost. Sometimes
it's all too much. You are asked whether a new feature can be
introduced into the network. If you say <span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>,
you might fall behind the competition; if you say
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span>, you're bluffing and you might be shooting
yourself in the foot. Linux became my most loved operating system,
when I realized that saying <span   class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span> is usually
more gambling with a good chance of success, than bluffing with an
empty hand. My involvement in GPIB for Linux is such a case.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x23596b8"></a>GPIB? What does it stand for?</h2></div></div><p>GPIB is a standard bus in data acquisition and industrial
process control. It was developed in 1965 by Hewlett-Packard and
was first called HPIB. It was subsequently renamed GPIB (general
purpose interface bus) or the IEEE488 interface. GPIB hardware is
available everywhere. All kinds of AD converters, digital meters,
even printers and plotters use it as the bus of choice. Clean up
those dusty corners in laboratories, and you may find an ancient
piece of hardware with a GPIB interface at the back. As PCs arrived
on researchers' desks, GPIB interface boards were developed,
enabling control of GPIB hardware chains via a computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x23597c0"></a>How Linux Support Came to Be</h2></div></div><p>I am involved with the Laboratory for Technical Physics in
the Faculty for Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana, capital of
Slovenia. The staff uses GPIB for experimental control and data
acquisition, and any computing environment introduced into the lab
must support GPIB if at all possible. After I converted the
laboratory to Linux, an end was put to printing via floppy disks
and waiting in queues for the daily mail on the single computer
hooked to the Internet. Standard Linux applications replaced most
of the everyday software previously in use. However, GPIB support
soon became an issue. I was not really a GPIB freak myself, but I
knew about its wide use, and I knew the spirit of Linux from my
long-time experience with it. The dice were rolling as I assured
everyone, &ldquo;GPIB for Linux? Yes, of course!&rdquo; All I had in hand at
the time was a short note in the Linux Hardware HOW-TO, directing
me to the Linux Lab Project in Germany (see Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x23598c8"></a>Software on the Web</h2></div></div><p>On one fine web surfing day, I found what I needed:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux GPIB package</em></span>, written by Claus
Schroter at Freie Universitet, Berlin. The package includes a
loadable GPIB driver module, the basic library for accessing the
bus functions from C and a Tcl interface, enabling GPIB for the Tcl
language.</p><p>I had Slackware 3.1, with kernel version 2.0.0 on a 100MHz
Pentium board with 16MB RAM. The GPIB interface card available was
the CEC PC488. A rather low-end ISA board but good enough for my
testing purposes. Informative documentation of the package states
that the following boards are supported: National Instruments
AT-GPIB, NI PCII and PCIIa and compatible boards, IBM GPIB adapter,
HP82355 and HP27109 adapters.</p><p>The module and GPIB library compiled out of the box, and
after actually reading the README file, Tcl support compiled as
well. The driver module can be configured at compile time, at
module load time or via library calls. Necessary parameters are the
hardware address of the GPIB board, the DMA channel and the IRQ
being used.</p><p>Before use, the library must be configured as well using the
/etc/gpib.conf file by default. A specific configuration can be
done for every hardware device attached to the bus. A special
identifier name should be provided for each device so that the
library can access any hardware device by a reasonable name. I
found this method of configuration very convenient. All GPIB
devices on the bus have different addresses and their
initialization strings vary. With configuration via /etc/gpib.conf
file, the necessary parameters must be determined and written into
the configuration file only once. Then, all you need to do is
remember the arbitrary name you assigned to that device. There is
also a Tcl/Tk-based application called
<span   class="bold"><b>ibconf</b></span> which simplifies
maintaining the configuration file.</p><p>The feature that drew most of my attention was remote GPIB,
<span   class="bold"><b>rGPIB</b></span>. It is a very cool option
that enables computers without a GPIB board to access a GPIB board
on a remote computer across a TCP/IP network. It is much cheaper
than buying interface cards and much simpler than swapping one GPIB
board between computers. Remote GPIB uses RPC (remote procedure
calls) for communication between client and server, so the RPC
portmapper must be up and running before the rGPIB server can be
used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x2359c38"></a>What To Do Now</h2></div></div><p>With the package compiled and ready to use, I took a
low-frequency spectral analyzer HP3582A with GPIB interface and a
HP3312A function generator to feed the analyzer. For readers who
aren't familiar with these machines, imagine yourselves counting
the flow of traffic on the highway. The highway represents the
function generator. You count the vehicles, determine the increase
of traffic from the last count and type the results into a portable
computer. With these actions, you act as an analyzer&mdash;give or take
a few Fourier transforms. That's the basic idea.</p><p>The computer should bring the analyzer up with initialization
strings sent over GPIB and set it into a mode, such that all its
functions can be controlled via the bus. With this control
established, the computer must ask the analyzer for data, and then
listen as the data is transmitted to the bus. As it is not my goal
to discuss the philosophy of GPIB in this article, it should be
enough to note that the GPIB software interface must provide the
means of writing and reading strings to and from the bus, plus some
extra functions for status and event-driven operation.</p><p>I attached the hardware to the Linux workstation and realized
that strings could now be transmitted flawlessly in both
directions. My work was done, and other members of the laboratory
could now use the new setup for serious experimentation. However,
as a Tcl/Tk fan, I couldn't stop at this point&mdash;I had to check out
the promised Tcl capabilities. A shared library, loadable from Tcl
is provided. It adds the new command
<span   class="bold"><b>gpib</b></span> to Tcl interpreter and all
the bus functions can be accessed via the new command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x2359e48"></a>Somebody Stop Me, Please!</h2></div></div><p>The bluffing worked out one hundred percent, and I held four
aces in one hand and a full house in another. Stop? No way! It
occurred to me that I could create a user-friendly interface to the
HP3582A spectral analyzer using Tcl/Tk power.</p><p>I started working on the user interface, then decided to do
my own Tcl interface library. Not because anything was wrong with
the existing one, I just needed an extra flag to disable actual
calls to the GPIB library, because I was doing part of the program
development at home without either a GPIB board or network access
to a remote GPIB. I added a flag at the Tcl level to enable all of
the functions to operate without actually calling the low-level
library. With the manual for the spectral analyzer and Linux as the
development platform, I created a neat user interface for remote
analyzer operation (see Figure 1).</p><p><a href="2405f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. User
Interface for Remote Analyzer</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2261580.0x235a0b0"></a>What Was This All About?</h2></div></div><p>When I finally recovered from the programming spasm, I pulled
away from the keyboard and took time to reconsider the improvement
in the laboratory situation. Previously the laboratory had one
ancient Motorola-based HP 300 workstation as the main work horse
for experimental control. Programming was tedious because most work
was done via device file without any high level library. Our other
choice was a PC with MS-DOS, which is a fine machine for
experimental work, but to my thinking useless as a good development
platform. I feel the new solution using Linux workstations is
superior to either of the other choices. You can read daily e-mail,
work on a GPIB application and perform non-critical measurement at
the same time on a single computer. If you are not scared of
writing few lines of C code, hacking a script or two and merging
together different development tools, a Linux workstation with GPIB
support is a splendid machine for an experimentalist. It was my
first involvement in GPIB, but the neatness and freedom of the
environment raised my enthusiasm and pushed me beyond my original
intentions.</p><p>There is, of course, the fact that at the time of writing
most of the commercially available software for experimental
control is native to Microsoft-based platforms or proprietary Unix
workstations. But this is changing with Linux gaining ever more
acceptance in products for measurement and control. In large
environments, where vendor support is an important issue,
commercial packages still prevail. However, for universities and
research laboratories with enthusiastic staff and less critical
demands, the Linux solution is worth trying. Of course, if you are
on a tight budget, you don't have much choice. Linux and the GPIB
package are free of charge and usually do not require new hardware.
Linux might even save you a bill or two in the future on
network-based capabilities. With real-time Linux being introduced
to the laboratory now and in the future, there should be no
restrictions on the seriousness and the importance of the
experiment.</p><p><a href="2405s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
