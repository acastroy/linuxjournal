  <div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h1 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c42ab0"></a>An Introduction to the GIMP Tool Kit</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Otto Hammersmith</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #47, March 1998</div></div><div><p>
    The purpose of this article is to give a short overview of
    what gtk+ is, what it can do and where to gather more
    information.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c432f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The GIMP tool kit
<span   class="bold"><b>gtk+</b></span> is the GUI libraries written
for use in the GIMP as an alternative to Motif. (See the GIMP
series of articles by Michael Hammel in the November to January
issues of <i  >LJ</i>.) Although gtk+ was created for
the GIMP, it can be used for any GUI application. In fact, recently
the gtk+ distribution has been split out from the GIMP distribution
in anticipation of the 1.0 release.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c434a8"></a>What Can gtk+ Do?</h2></div></div><p>Like all GUI tool kits, gtk+ provides a variety of GUI
components, a.k.a. widgets. One thing that sets gtk+ apart from
tool kits such as Motif is the breadth of the widgets provided.
Naturally, all tool kits provide some form of a button widget.
<span   class="bold"><b>gtk+</b></span> also provides components such
as tabbed notebooks and fully functional color pickers not included
in the core widgets of other tools kits. Screen shots are provided
in Figures 1 and 2 as examples of the appearance of gtk+
widgets.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2465f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2465f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Color Selection Widget
</p></div></div><p>Another advantage of gtk+ is that it's not limited to a
single language. Even though gtk+ is written in C and was
originally intended for use from C, there are bindings to many
other languages. Just a few of them are C++, Objective C, Python,
Scheme, Perl&mdash;the list goes on and on with new additions
frequently. Chances are someone has already started on bindings for
your favorite language.</p><p>Best of all, gtk+ is under the Library GNU Public License
(LGPL), so there are absolutely no licensing concerns when writing
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c43a28"></a>The Pieces</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP tool kit is made up of three different layers. Each
layer has its own distinct functionality and depends on the layers
below it. The three layers are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>glib</b></span>: This is a
support library that is of general usefulness in many C programs,
even non-GUI applications. Most of its utilities are common data
structures, such as linked lists
(<span   class="bold"><b>GList</b></span>), and convenience
functions, to ease porting between Unices, e.g., wrappers around
<span   class="bold"><b>malloc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span>
(<span   class="bold"><b>gmalloc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gfree</b></span>).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>gdk</b></span>: This library
is basically a thin layer over Xlib and some of Xt to handle the
basics of drawing on the X display and handling X events. Having
this library means that applications writers never have to see the
underlying X libraries to get work done. This library also contains
several useful functions for things like handling timers, polling
file descriptors and more.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>gtk</b></span>: This library
is the meat of gtk+, where all the GUI elements are defined. This
library relies heavily on gdk and glib to do its job.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c44058"></a>Learning gtk+</h2></div></div><p>For someone with experience in C programming, gtk+ should be
fairly easy to pick up. The internals of gtk+ use some advanced C
features like function pointers and some tricks with structs, but
application writers should never need to worry about the internals
of gtk+. Naturally, any experience with other GUI tool kits
(especially Motif) will make learning gtk+ easier.</p><p>For a long time the only documentation of gtk+ was the source
code, and the sample application, the GIMP. Fortunately, the gtk+
tutorial at http://levien.com/slow/gtk/ has filled that
void.</p><p>However, gtk+ is a moving target (still being developed) so
be wary. If there's any doubt about the validity of some
documentation, always double check it against the source code. And,
as always, nothing can beat actually writing code to test an option
out.</p><p>There is also a mailing list dedicated to discussing gtk+. To
subscribe, send mail to gtk-list-request@redhat.com with a subject
of &ldquo;subscribe <span   class="emphasis"><em>email-address</em></span>&rdquo;, replacing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>email-address</em></span> with your e-mail address.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b4b580.0x1c44318"></a>gtk+ Status</h2></div></div><p>When learning about gtk+, remember that it is still under
development, but it is certainly usable for non-trivial
applications, the GIMP, for example. There are still plenty of
minor bugs and even a few major ones you'll have to work around.
For example, at the time of this writing, the text widget still
needed a lot of work. But in the two months or more before anyone
will read this article in print a lot can happen. The best place to
check on the current status of the gtk+ libraries and to get the
source is at http://www.gimp.org/gtk/.</p></div></div>
