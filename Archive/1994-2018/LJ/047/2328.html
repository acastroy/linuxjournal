recycling logo in a TeX document should have been simple enough.
Instead, a blank space marked the position on the display where the
logo should have appeared. A quick look through all of my LaTeX
documentation, including the <span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span>
man page, provided no answer. There seemed to be no way for xdvi to
display a TeX \special command in the dvi output; in this case, an
embedded PostScript image. I considered this to be a major
shortcoming of xdvi, and, of course, TeX. After all, isn't
combining text and graphics on a page part of what computer
publishing is all about? Why should TeX, one of the most
sophisticated typesetting systems in the world, be constrained by
the lack of a PostScript previewer? Or the requirement for a
PostScript printer, for that matter? It is said that the longest
journey begins with a single step. The journey I'm about to
describe has brought me a considerable distance toward
professional-quality publishing, via a utility that had been
sitting quietly in a subdirectory of my /usr partition all along.
</p><p>The utility is <span   class="bold"><b>Ghostscript</b></span>.
GNU Ghostscript, Version 3.33, is the Swiss Army knife of graphics
programs. Essentially, it's a PostScript language interpreter. More
specifically, Ghostscript renders PostScript code to any bitmapped
device on your system, whether it be the screen, printer, or G3 fax
file. The man page says, &ldquo;Ghostscript is a programming language
similar to Adobe System's PostScript language, which is in turn
similar to Forth.&rdquo; (This statement comes almost verbatim from the
book: Adobe Systems, Incorporated: <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostScript: Language
Tutorial and Cookbook,</em></span> Addison-Wesley, 1986.)
Ghostscript also substitutes fonts from its own library when
rendering documents if the fonts are not otherwise available,
scales and rotates text, and performs any of the other
typographical feats for which PostScript is famous. Despite the
apparent complexity of the task, no knowledge of the PostScript
language is required. For the most part, a little experimentation
with the command-line options is all that's needed. Yet
Ghostscript's PostScript interpreter is fully accessible.</p><p>If I want to print that EPS recycling logo at the bottom of a
page of DVI output, I would insert the following commands in my
LaTeX input file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\usepackage{graphics} ... \vfil \includegraphics{recycle.eps}
</pre><p>Then, it is simply a matter of running the input file through
teTeX, using the command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pslatex letter.tex
</pre>


and then converting teTeX's dvi output to PostScript with dvips:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dvips -f &lt;letter.dvi &gt;letter.ps
</pre>


The <b  >-f</b> command-line option tells dvips to act as
a filter, reading from standard input and writing to standard
output. Now, we have a PostScript file ready for printing.
Ghostscript images this file in a format that's understandable to
any bitmapped device on your system, whether it is a VGA display or
a laser printer.
</p><p>Ghostscript's command-line options are numerous. Look at
ghostscript's USE.DOC file for an complete description. You can
view a brief summary with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gs -help | less
</pre><p>For example, if I want to print the file letter.ps on a
Hewlett Packard DeskJet printer, I would use the command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=deskjet
/-sOutputFile=-\
         letter.ps quit.ps &gt;gs.out
</pre>


The first option, <b  >-q</b>, suppresses messages to the
console. However, to run Ghostscript in batch mode, the
<b  >-q</b> option on its own is not enough. That's
because Ghostscript uses its own PostScript code at run time to
output the image.
</p><p>From the command line, we define several variables, the first
being NOPAUSE, which tells Ghostscript's
<span   class="bold"><b>showpage()</b></span> routine not to pause
after each page is output. When viewing output on a screen, it is
best to leave NOPAUSE unset and let Ghostscript prompt you to view
each page in turn.</p><p>Next, we set the DEVICE variable. In the example above, the
output device is a HP Deskjet. Ghostscript's dictionary has output
parameters defined for all the devices documented in its
command-line help.</p><p>The next variable which needs defining is OutputFile. Here,
we set it to <b  >-</b> or standard output. This is the
file to which Ghostscript will write its image. In most instances,
however, Ghostscript provides no means for that image to be
displayed. We'll get to that in a moment. Then we specify letter.ps
on the command line as our target input file.</p><p>When we write a file with the
<span   class="bold"><b>pslatex</b></span> command, LaTeX uses the
font metrics available to it; that is, it uses Computer Modern
Roman as its default font. However, the pslatex command has been
implemented in teTeX so that dvips, which does the DVI to
PostScript conversion, will request PostScript fonts. These fonts
can be provided via either the printer or via software. In the
latter case, Ghostscript produces the output image using Type 1
fonts from its own library.</p><p>Finally, we input the file quit.ps. This file is part of
Ghostscript's standard library and is simply the command
<span   class="bold"><b>quit</b></span> followed by a newline
character. It is read into the Ghostscript interpreter just like
any other input.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2680580.0x2778e48"></a>Viewing Images</h2></div></div><p>Viewing images on-screen is only a little more difficult.
Ghostscript for Linux comes with both X11 and SVGALib support. The
executables for both versions should be in the /usr/bin directory:
gs-with-X11 and gs-without-X11. You can run either version using
its actual file name, but the more common implementation uses a
soft link of the actual executable to the
<span   class="bold"><b>gs</b></span> command. In either case, the
executable's permissions should be setuid root so it can access the
display. We'll describe how to use Ghostscript as a PostScript
previewer with both the X Window System and SVGALib.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2680580.0x2778fa8"></a>Ghostscript with X11</h2></div></div><p>The X Window System provides a lot of the display support
that Ghostscript would need to provide otherwise. As a result, it
is by far the way to use Ghostscript as a previewer. As with the
above example, we want to pass letter.tex through LaTeX and then
convert the output to PostScript with the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pslatex letter.tex; \
        dvips -f &lt;letter.dvi &gt;letter.ps
</pre><p>Again, we need to specify the DEVICE string to gs, which is
simply X11 for the X display. Ghostscript treats an X11 display
frame as the standard output, and the X display services provide
the geometry to display an entire page. A virtual window manager
like FVWM already provides the facilities to scroll the view over
the entire page. The ghostscript command, then, is simply:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gs -r72 -sDEVICE=X11 letter.ps
</pre>


This will provide us with an actual-size page on the screen,
because we've overridden the default resolution with the
<b  >-r</b> switch.
</p><p>A VGA display provides about 72 dots per inch resolution, so
a legible, actual-size full U.S. letter page will not fit on the
screen. This is why we rely on FVWM or another virtual window
manager to scroll the view across the entire page. Ghostscript
draws a page-high window on your X display. About half of the page
is visible at a time. You can, of course, view the full page at
twice its actual size by specifying your output resolution as
36dpi.</p><p>The simplest way to execute the Ghostscript command is in an
xterm window. The page appears in a window which displays the child
process of the Ghostscript command. Ghostscript writes its messages
to standard error, which here is the xterm. Pressing
<b  >enter</b> in the xterm window tells
<span   class="bold"><b>showpage</b></span> to display each
successive page of Ghostscript output. You can set the default
resolution in your ~/.Xdefaults file by adding the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Ghostscript*xResolution: 72 Ghostscript*yResolution: 72
</pre><p>and then merge the defaults with the other X server defaults:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</pre>


If the resolution isn't specified, the page is displayed on the
screen at 300dpi, about one-quarter its actual size, which is
visible in a 640x480 view without scrolling.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2680580.0x2779478"></a>Ghostscript with SVGALib</h2></div></div><p>Things get a little more difficult when using a VGA display
without X11 support. A standard Linux tty device provides no
ready-made provision for paging over a full, U.S. letter-size
image. Also, Ghostscript's SVGALib routines must be provided with
geometry and resolution information to preview images. The
following information is specific to my Compaq laptop, Chanel3,
which has a 16 color, 640x480 standard VGA display, GNU Ghostscript
Version 3.33 and SVGALib version libvga.so.1.2.10. You'll need to
adjust the parameters to suit your hardware, but the basic
procedure should be similar.</p><p>The settings that Ghostscript recognizes for various hardware
configurations are listed in use.doc file and the gs man page. The
DEVICE string is &ldquo;linux&rdquo; for a Linux virtual console; that
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/tty1 - /dev/tty9
</pre><p>This string corresponds to the virtual console's /etc/termcap
entries. The <b  >-r</b> resolution, parameter is one of
several dozen VGA modes that SVGALib recognizes. Ghostscript
defines single-digit mode numbers which correspond to standard
width-by-height notation. There is a complete list in the
Ghostscript man page. In this case, Mode 4 is 16-color, 640x480
VGA. Much of the following information depends on whether SVGALib
provides information on display geometry for your particular
display. Ghostscript requires this information to display anything.
It must be provided, for one thing, with the aspect ratio of the
display (the ratio of the display's width to its height) in order
to scale the fonts correctly.
</p><p>The geometry parameter (<b  >-g</b>) tells
Ghostscript the display dimensions. Ghostscript scales the output
page to the geometry we specify. We'll address this problem in a
moment. With these parameters set, our Ghostscript command
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gs -sDEVICE=linux -r4 -g640x480 letter.ps
</pre><p>Remember that gs is really a link to the executable file
/usr/bin/gs-without-X11. Here, we tell Ghostscript to display a
full page by specifying a display geometry that's twice the size of
the actual screen. This gives us a page that is slightly more than
twice as large as the video display. To double the size of the
virtual display&mdash;the &ldquo;device space&rdquo; in PostScript jargon&mdash;we use
the command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gs -sDEVICE=linux -r4 -g640x960 letter.ps
</pre>


which gives us an actual-size view of the top half of the printed
page. To view the bottom half of the page, we can specify an offset
of the image's Y origin as half of a U.S. letter-size page:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gs -sDEVICE=linux -r4 -g640x960 -dYO=5.5
letter.ps
</pre>


The default units are inches. The image's X origin can be shifted
similarly.

Previewer</h2></div></div><p>Integrating Ghostscript into your system is not that
difficult. For example, if you routinely write documents in Emacs'
LaTeX mode, the following bash script takes the DVI output of
Emacs' tex-buffer command, converts it to PostScript, and then
post-processes the output through Ghostscript. Finally, it sends
the output to the print spooler. This script,
<span   class="bold"><b>gsprint</b></span> (see
<a href="2328l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>), can be called by
Emacs' tex-print command directly. Note that the commands which
call Ghostscript and then spool the output to the
<span   class="bold"><b>lpr</b></span> daemon should all be typed on
one line.</p><p>An even shorter version of this script,
<span   class="bold"><b>gspreview</b></span> (see
<a href="2328l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>), previews the document
and can be called by Emacs' tex-view command under X11. Emacs
provides the name of the TeX DVI file as the argument to its
tex-print and tex-view commands. All you need to do is specify the
names of the external commands. First, make sure that the scripts
are located in a directory in the search path (I use /usr/local/bin
for my shell scripts). Give them execute permission with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod a+x gsprint gspreview
</pre><p>Then add the elisp code shown in
<a href="2328l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> to your .emacs file.
Whenever you use the tex-print or tex-view commands
(<b  >ctrl-c ctrl-p</b> and <b  >ctrl-c
ctrl-v</b>, respectively) in TeX-mode or LaTeX-mode, these
shell scripts are called and their commands executed, using the DVI
output of the most recent TeX command.
</p><p>The next bash script, which I named
<span   class="bold"><b>pvga</b></span> (see
<a href="2328l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>), uses Ghostscript to
preview output on non-X VGA displays. It takes as its argument the
name of the TeX DVI output file and two optional arguments: a list
of pages to be output and the Y-origin offset for each page. This
script can be run from the command line or used as the core routine
of a more complex VGA previewer. The list of pages that you want to
view, formatted according to the dvips documentation, must be
specified before the Y offset.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2680580.0x2770758"></a>PostScript in a (Virtual) Box</h2></div></div><p>You can easily replace TeX's Computer Modern fonts with
Ghostscript's scalable fonts. By default, dvips calls the MakeTeXPK
program, which in turn calls MetaFont, to generate the physical
Computer Modern fonts not present on the hard disk.</p><p>Printing is faster with bitmap fonts rather than scalable
fonts, but scalable fonts that use Adobe's standard encodings
provide the complete Adobe character set, including kerning and
ligature pairs, which the Computer Modern fonts do not provide.
With reasonably fast hardware, you can turn off dvips'
font-generation feature and hardly notice a difference in speed.
Dvips provides the <b  >-V</b> command line switch for
this purpose. The bash script
<span   class="bold"><b>vgspreview</b></span> (see
<a href="2328l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>) is a modification of
gspreview, above. Remember to specify <span   class="emphasis"><em>zero</em></span>
after the <b  >-V</b> switch, which turns the font
generation facility <span   class="emphasis"><em>off.</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2680580.0x2770ac8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There are many other tasks that Ghostscript can perform with
ease:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create faxes.</p></li><li><p>Create PDF files that can be read by Adobe's
