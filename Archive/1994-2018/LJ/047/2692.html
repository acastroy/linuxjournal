    On December 10, 1997, the Nokia Foundation granted its 1997
    Award to Linus
    Torvalds, one of the world's most famous young Finnish researchers in
    the area of information technology.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118e580.0x1286298"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have a Nokia cellular phone, use
it to call your friends and let them know that Linus Torvalds won
another award. On December 10, 1997, the Nokia Foundation granted
its 1997 Award to Linus Torvalds, one of the world's most famous
young Finnish researchers in the area of information technology.
The award is worth FIM 50,000 (about $9400 US).
</p><p>Nokia's press release stated that Linus' inspiring example
for young researchers was of special interest in his selection. I
don't think this comes as a surprise to those of us who have been
members of the Linux community for the past few years, but it is
nice to see such recognition from a foundation established by a
large company.</p><p>The Nokia Foundation, established in 1995, supports the
development of information and telecommunications education and
technologies in Finland. In addition to the award presented to
Linus, the Foundation granted more than thirty scholarships and one
fellowship to further individual and institutional development at
Finnish universities.</p><p>At the Grant Holder Announcement event, Nokia President and
CEO Jorma Ollila emphasized the importance of education, research
and development in maintaining the competitiveness of the Finnish
telecommunications industry. Ollila discussed the need to
complement study time with practical applications: &ldquo;If we could
shorten the study time by one year, for example, and spend that
time on effective research and development work, we would
remarkably strengthen our national competitiveness.&rdquo; Obviously,
the Nokia Foundation believed that combining graduate studies with
the creation of an operating system that is used around the world
was a pretty good example of these principles.</p><p>Congratulations, Linus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x118e580.0x1286500"></a>More Than Research</h2></div></div><p>As we all know, there is a lot more to Linux these days than
research. December 19, the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>
opened. If you read last month's <i  >Linux Journal</i>, you know that a herd of Digital Alpha computers
running Linux were used in the production of the film. While
Finland isn't getting a big kickback from the box office receipts,
Mr. Ollila is certainly right that research can make a
difference.</p><p>Linux is doing a lot more out there than making movies. The
Linux Means Business columns we run each month offer detailed looks
into how government, business and industry use Linux. Another less
detailed resource is a web page put together by Mercury Information
Technology, Inc. This is a page dedicated to Linux business
applications. What you find there are companies like Sony,
Mercedes-Benz, Cisco Systems and Fluke as well as the companies you
regularly see in the pages of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>This page is a great resource and M-tech has agreed to our
mirroring it on the business connection link of the Linux Resources
page (http://www.linuxresources.com).</p><p><a href="2692s1.html" target="_self">New at
