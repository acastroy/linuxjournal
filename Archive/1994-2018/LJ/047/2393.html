    Ease your creation and maintenance of web pages using this
    handy pre-processor called m4.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x24814a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It's amazing how easy it is to write
simple HTML pages&mdash;and the availability of WYSIWYG (what you see is
what you get) HTML editors like Netscape Gold lulls one into a mood
of &ldquo;don't worry, be happy&rdquo;. However, managing multiple,
inter-related pages of HTML rapidly gets very difficult. I recently
had a slightly complex set of pages to put together, and I started
thinking, &ldquo;there has to be an easier way.&rdquo;
</p><p>I immediately turned to the WWW and looked up all sorts of
tools&mdash;but quite honestly I was rather disappointed. Mostly, they
were what I would call &ldquo;typing aids&rdquo;&mdash;instead of having to
remember arcane incantations like <b  >&lt;a
href="link"7gt;text&lt;/a&gt;</b> text, you are given a
button or a magic keychord like <b  >alt-ctrl-j</b> which
remembers the syntax and does all the typing for you.</p><p>Linux to the rescue&mdash;since HTML is built as ordinary text
files, the normal Linux text management tools can be used. This
includes revision control tools such as
<span   class="bold"><b>rcs</b></span> and the text manipulation
tools like <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span>, etc. These tools offer
significant help in version control and managing development by
multiple users as well as automating the process of displaying
information from a database (the classic <b  >grep |sort
|awk</b> pipeline).</p><p>The use of these tools with HTML is documented elsewhere,
e.g., Jim Weirich's article in <i  >Linux Journal</i>
Issue 36, April 1997, &ldquo;Using Perl to Check Web Links&rdquo;. I highly
recommend this article as yet another way to really flex those
Linux muscles when writing HTML.</p><p>What I will cover here is work I've done recently using the
pre-processor <span   class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> to maintain HTML.
The ideas can very easily be extended to the more general SGML
case.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x24819d0"></a>Using m4</h2></div></div><p>I decided to use m4 after looking at various other
pre-processors including <span   class="bold"><b>cpp</b></span>, the
C front-end, which is perhaps a little too C-specific to be useful
with HTML. <span   class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> is a generic and
clean macro expansion program, and it's available under most Unices
including Linux.</p><p>Instead of editing *.html files, I create *.m4 files with my
favourite text editor. These files look something like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_include(stdlib.m4)
_HEADER(`This is my header')
&lt;P&gt;This is some plain text&lt;P&gt;
_HEAD1(`This is a main heading')
&lt;P&gt;This is some more plain text&lt;P&gt;
_TRAILER
</pre><p>The format is just HTML code, but you can include files and
add macros rather like in C. I use a convention that my new macros
are in capitals and start with an <b  >_</b> character to
make them stand out from HTML language and to avoid name-space
collisions.
</p><p>The m4 file is then processed as follows to create an .html
file using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4 -P &lt;file.m4 &gt;file.html
</pre><p>This process is especially easy if you create a makefile to
automate these steps in the usual way. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.SUFFIXES: .m4 .html
.m4.html:
        m4 -P &lt;$*.m4 &gt;$*.html
DEFault:        index.html
*.html: stdlib.m4
all:    default PROJECT1 PROJECT2
PROJECT1:
        (cd project2; make all)
PROJECT2:
        (cd project2; make all)
</pre>


Some of the most useful commands in m4 are listed here with their
cpp equivalents shown in parentheses:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_include:</b></span>
includes a common file into your HTML (#include)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_define:</b></span> defines
an m4 variable (#define)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_ifdef:</b></span> a
conditional (#ifdef)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_changecom:</b></span>
change the m4 comment character (normally #)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_debugmode:</b></span>
control error diagnostics</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_traceon/off:</b></span>
turn tracing on and off</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_dnl:</b></span>
comment</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_incr</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>m4_decr:</b></span> simple arithmetic</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_eval:</b></span> more
general arithmetic</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_esyscmd:</b></span>
execute a Linux command and use the output</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4_divert(i):</b></span> This
is a little complicated, so skip on first reading. It is a way of
storing text for output at the end of normal processing. It will
come in useful later, when we get to automatic numbering of
headings. It sends output from m4 to a temporary file number
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>. At the end of processing, any text which
was diverted is then output, in the order of the file number
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>. File number <b  >-1</b> is the
bit bucket and can be used to comment out chunks of comments. File
number 0 is the normal output stream. Thus, for example, you can
use m4_divert to divert text to file 1, and it will only be output
at the end.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x2482b58"></a>Sharing HTML Elements Across Several
Pages</h2></div></div><p>In many &ldquo;nests&rdquo; of HTML pages, each page shares elements
such as a button bar containing links to other pages like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Home]  [Next]  [Prev]  [Index]
</pre><p>This is fairly easy to create in each page. The trouble is
that if you make a change in the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; button-bar then you
have the tedious job of finding each occurrence of it in every file
and manually making the changes. With m4 we can more easily do this
job by putting the shared elements into an m4_include statement,
just like C.
</p><p>Let's also automate the naming of pages by putting the
following lines into an include file called button_bar.m4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_BUTTON_BAR',
 &lt;a href="homepage.html"&gt;[Home]&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href="$1"&gt;[Next]&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href="$2"&gt;[Prev]&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href="indexpage.html"&gt;[Index]&lt;/a&gt;)
</pre><p>and then these lines in the document:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4_include button_bar.m4
_BUTTON_BAR(`page_after_this.html',
 `page_before_this.html')
</pre>


The $1 and $2 parameters in the macro definition are replaced by
the strings in the macro call.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287b0c0"></a>Managing HTML elements that often change</h2></div></div><p>It is troublesome to have items change in multiple HTML
pages. For example, if your e-mail address changes, you need to
change all references to it to the new address. Instead, with m4
you can put a line like the following in your stdlib.m4
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_EMAIL_ADDRESS', `MyName@foo.bar.com')
</pre><p>and then just put <b  >_EMAIL_ADDRESS</b> in your
m4 files.
</p><p>A more substantial example comes from building strings with
multiple components, any of which may change as the page is
developed. If, like me, you develop on one machine, test out the
page and then upload to another machine with a totally different
address, then you could use the m4_ifdef command in your stdlib.m4
file (just like the <span   class="bold"><b>#ifdef</b></span> command
in cpp). For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_LOCAL')
...
m4_define(`_HOMEPAGE',
 m4_ifdef(`_LOCAL',
 `//127.0.0.1/~YourAccount',
 `http://ISP.com/~YourAccount'))
m4_define(`_PLUG', `&lt;A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/linux/"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="_HOMEPAGE/gif/powered.gif"
ALT=&lt;"[Linux Information]"&gt; &lt;/A&gt;')
</pre><p>Note the careful use of quotes to prevent the variable
<b  >_LOCAL</b> from being expanded.
<b  >_HOMEPAGE</b> takes on different values according to
whether the variable <b  >_LOCAL</b> is defined or not.
This definition can then ripple through the entire project as you
build the pages.
</p><p>In this example, <b  >_PLUG</b> is a macro to
advertise Linux. When you are testing your pages, use the local
version of <b  >_HOMEPAGE</b>. When you are ready to
upload, remove or comment out the <b  >_LOCAL</b>
definition in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_dnl m4_define(`_LOCAL')
</pre><p>... and then re-make.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287b748"></a>Creating New Text Styles</h2></div></div><p>Styles built into HTML include things like
<b  >&lt;EM&gt;</b> for emphasis and
<b  >&lt;CITE&gt;</b> for citations. With m4 you can
define your own new styles like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_MYQUOTE',
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;EM&gt;$1&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;)
</pre><p>If, later, you decide you prefer
<b  >&lt;STRONG&gt;</b> instead of
<b  >&lt;EM&gt;</b>, it is a simple matter to change the
definition. Then, every <b  >_MYQUOTE</b> paragraph falls
into line with a quick <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>.
</p><p>The classic guides to good HTML writing say things like &ldquo;It
is strongly recommended that you employ the logical styles such as
<b  >&lt;EM&gt;...&lt;/EM&gt;</b> rather than the
physical styles such as <b  >&lt;I&gt;...&lt;/I&gt;</b>
in your documents.&rdquo; Curiously, the WYSIWYG editors for HTML
generate purely physical styles. Using the m4 styles may be a good
way to keep on using logical styles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287bc18"></a>Typing and Mnemonic Aids</h2></div></div><p>I don't depend on WYSIWYG editing (having been brought up on
<span   class="bold"><b>troff</b></span>) but all the same I'm not
averse to using help where it's available. There is a choice (and
maybe it's a fine line) to be made between:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;Some code you want to display.
&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
</pre><p>and:
<pre     class="programlisting">
_CODE(Some code you want to display.)
</pre>


In this case, you would define <b  >_CODE</b> like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_CODE',
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;$1&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;)
</pre>


Which version you prefer is a matter of taste and convenience
although the m4 macro certainly saves some typing. Another example
I like to use, since I can never remember the syntax for links, is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_LINK', &lt;a href="$1"&gt;$2&lt;/a&gt;)
</pre>


Then, instead of typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;a href="URL_TO_SOMEWHERE"&gt;Click here to get to SOMEWHERE
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>


I type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
_LINK(`URL_TO_SOMEWHERE', `Click here to get to SOMEWHERE')
</pre>

facility with two operators
<span   class="bold"><b>m4_incr</b></span> and

to create automatic numbering, perhaps for headings, for
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(_CARDINAL,0)
m4_define(_H, `m4_define(`_CARDINAL',
 m4_incr(_CARDINAL))&lt;H2&gt;_CARDINAL.0 $1&lt;/H2&gt;')
_H(First Heading)

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;H2&gt;1.0 First Heading&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;2.0 Second Heading&lt;/H2&gt;
</pre>

use them consistently. I hate repeating myself because I am lazy
and because I make mistakes, so I find this feature an absolute
necessity.</p><p>A good example of the power of m4 is in building a table of
contents in a big page. This involves repeating the heading title
in the table of contents and then in the text itself. This is
tedious and error-prone, especially when you change the titles.
There are specialised tools for generating a table of contents from
HTML pages, but the simple facility provided by m4 is irresistible
to me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287c6c0"></a>Simple To Understand TOC</h2></div></div><p>The following example is a fairly simple-minded table of
contents generator. First, create some useful macros in
stdlib.m4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_LINK_TO_LABEL',
 &lt;A HREF="#$1"&gt;$1&lt;/A&gt;)
m4_define(`_SECTION_HEADER',
 &lt;A NAME="$1"&gt;&lt;H2&gt;$1&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/A&gt;)
</pre><p>Then define all the section headings in a table at the start
of the page body:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(`_DIFFICULTIES',
 `The difficulties of HTML')
m4_define(`_USING_M4', `Using
 &lt;EM&gt;m4&lt;/EM&gt;')
m4_define(`_SHARING', `Sharing HTML
 Elements Across Several Pages')
</pre>


Then build the table:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;
 &lt;LI&gt; _LINK_TO_LABEL(_DIFFICULTIES)
 &lt;LI&gt; _LINK_TO_LABEL(_USING_M4)
 &lt;LI&gt; _LINK_TO_LABEL(_SHARING)
&lt;UL&gt;
</pre>


Finally, write the text:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ...
_SECTION_HEADER(_DIFFICULTIES)
...
</pre>


The advantages of this approach are twofold. If you change your
headings you only need to change them in one place, and the table
of contents is then automatically regenerated. Also, the links are
guaranteed to work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287c980"></a>Simple To Use TOC</h2></div></div><p>The table of contents generator that I normally use is a bit
more complex and requires a bit more study, but it is much easier
to use. It not only builds the table, but it also automatically
numbers the headings on the fly&mdash;up to four levels of numbering
(e.g., section 3.2.1.3), although this can be easily extended. It
is very simple to use as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Where you want the table to appear, call
<b  >Start_TOC</b>.</p></li><li><p>At every heading use <b  >_H1(`Heading for
level 1')</b> or <b  >_H2(`Heading for level
2')</b> as appropriate.</p></li><li><p>After the last line of HTML code (probably
<b  >&lt;/HTML&gt;</b>), call
<b  >End_TOC</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>The code for these macros is shown in
<a href="2393l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. One restriction is that
you should not use diversions (i.e., m4-divert) within your text,
unless you preserve the diversion to file 1 used by this TOC
generator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x287cf58"></a>Simple Tables</h2></div></div><p>Other than Tables of Contents, many browsers support tabular
information. Here are some funky macros as a short cut to producing
these tables. First, an example (see Figure 1) of their use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;CENTER&gt;
_Start_Table(BORDER=5)
_Table_Hdr(,Apples, Oranges, Lemons)
_Table_Row(England, 100,250,300)
_Table_Row(France,200,500,100)
_Table_Row(Germany,500,50,90)

familiarisation will pay dividends. Definitive documentation is
available (for example, in the Emacs info documentation system)
but, without being a complete tutorial, here are a few tips based
on my experiences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x278ef58"></a>Gotcha 1&mdash;Quotes</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4</b></span>'s quotation characters
are the grave accent <b  >`</b> which starts the quote,
and the acute accent <b  >'</b> which ends it. It may
help to put all arguments to macros in quotes, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_HEAD1(`This is a heading')
</pre><p>The main reason for using quotes is to prevent confusion if
commas are contained in an argument to a macro, since m4 uses
commas to separate macro parameters. For example, the line
<b  >_CODE(foo, bar)</b> would put the foo in the HTML
output but not the bar. Use quotes in the line <b  >_CODE(`foo,
bar')</b>, and it works properly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x278f2c8"></a>Gotcha 2&mdash;Word Swallowing</h2></div></div><p>The biggest problem with m4 is that some versions of it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>swallow</em></span> key words that it recognises, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>include</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>format</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>divert</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gnu</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>line</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>shift</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>unix</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>builtin</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>define</em></span>. You can protect these words by putting
them in single quotes, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Smart people `include' Linux in their list
of computer essentials.
</pre><p>The trouble is, this is both inconvenient and easy to forget.
</p><p>A safer way to protect keywords (my preference) is to invoke
m4 with the <b  >-P</b> or
<b  >--prefix-builtins</b> option. Then all built-in
macro names are modified so that they all begin with the prefix
<b  >m4_</b> and ordinary words are left as is. For
example, using this option, one would write m4_define instead of
define (as shown in the examples in this article). One hitch is
that not all versions of m4 support this option&mdash;most notably some
PC versions under MS-DOS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2389580.0x278fa00"></a>Gotcha 3&mdash;Comments</h2></div></div><p>Comment lines in m4 begin with the # character&mdash;everything
from the # to the end of the line is ignored and output unchanged.
If you want to use # in the HTML page, you must quote it like this:
<b  >`#'</b>. Another option (my preference) is to change
the m4 comment character to something exotic with a line like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_changecom(`[[[[')
</pre><p>and not have to worry about # symbols in your text.
</p><p>If you want to use comments in the m4 file but not have them
appear in the final HTML file, use the <b  >macro
m4_dnl</b> (dnl = <span   class="bold"><b>D</b></span>elete to
<span   class="bold"><b>N</b></span>ew
<span   class="bold"><b>L</b></span>ine). This macro suppresses
everything until the next newline character.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4_define(_NEWMACRO, `foo bar')
m4_dnl This is a comment
</pre><p>Yet another way to have source code ignored is the m4_divert
command. The main purpose of m4_divert is to save text in a
temporary buffer for inclusion in the file later&mdash;for example, in
building a table of contents or index. However, if you divert to
&ldquo;-1&rdquo;, it just goes to limbo-land. This option is useful for
getting rid of the whitespace generated by the
<b  >m4_define</b> command. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4_divert(-1) diversion on
m4_define(this ...)
m4_define(that ...)
m4_divert diversion turned off

number of error diagnostics that m4 outputs. The easiest way to do
this is to add the following to your m4 file as debugging

statement that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!--#include file="junk.html" --&gt;
</pre><p>However, the HTML include has the following limitations:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The work of including and interpreting the include
is done on the server-side before downloading and adds overhead as
the server has to scan files for include statements.</p></li><li><p>Most servers (especially public ISPs) deactivate
this feature because of the large overhead.</p></li><li><p>Include is all you get&mdash;no macro substitution, no
parameters to macros, no ifdef, etc., as with m4.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>There are several other features of m4 that I have not yet
exploited in my HTML ramblings so far, such as regular expressions.
It might be interesting to create a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; stdlib.m4 for
general use with nice macros for general text processing and HTML
functions. By all means download my version of stdlib.m4 as a base
for your own hacking. I would be interested in hearing of useful
macros, and if there is enough interest, maybe a Mini-HOWTO could
evolve from this article.</p><p>There are many additional advantages to using Linux to
develop HTML pages, far beyond the simple assistance given by the
typical typing aids and WYSIWYG tools. Certainly, I will go on
using m4 until HTML catches up&mdash;I will then do my last
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> and drop back to using pure
HTML. I hope you enjoy these little tricks and encourage you to
contribute your own.</p></div></div>

      has been hacking at Unix since 1981
      under a variety of excuses and has somehow been paid for it at
      least some of the time. It's allowed him to pursue another
      interest&mdash;living in warm, exotic countries including Hong Kong,
      Australia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Lesotho and (presently) Singapore.
      His initial aversion to the cold was learned in the UK.
