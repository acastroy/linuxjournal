    This article gives you a high-level introduction to
    programming with XView, a GUI toolkit that complements the
    OpenLook interface.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2927580.0x2a1f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are many window systems out there
in the computer world&mdash;some are taking control of the desktop,
while others are still strong in their workstation niche. Just as
most of us would prefer to program in a high-level language rather
than assembly, XView provides us with a high-level approach to GUI
development. XView components come with default settings that make
sense, so that a newly created button, for example, will look and
act &ldquo;correct&rdquo; as soon as it is made. The API for XView is at once
both simple and extensive. Simple, because we can do most jobs
using only three different library routines, and extensive because
we can control nearly all aspects of each component with those
routines.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2927580.0x2a1f4a8"></a>First Steps</h2></div></div><p>Let's jump right in and take a look at the simple XView
program shown in <a href="2035l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. Make
sure you have XView and the OpenLook libraries on your system;
otherwise, you'll get compile errors. Put this example into a file
called sample.c and compile it using the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cc -o sample -I$OPENWINHOME/include\
-L$OPENWINHOME/lib\
-L/usr/X11/lib sample.c -lxview -lolgx -lX11
</pre><p>where OPENWINHOME is the home directory on your system for
OpenWindows, usually /usr/openwin.
</p><p>When you run sample.c, you'll be presented with a simple text
editor, a functionality of the standard XView text sub-window
component. Type in the text window, using the keyboard cursor keys
to move around. Highlight words, lines and paragraphs with mouse
clicks and drags. The right mouse button brings up a menu to open,
save and insert files, exit the text and search for strings. Grab
the end-stop of the slider and pull it down&mdash;you now have two views
of the same text.</p><p>This is truly neat, but how did we get here? Let's walk
through the sample program together.</p><p>First, we include two header files: one for generic XView
information and one for the text sub-window component. If we had
additional components (perhaps a pair of push buttons to open and
save files), we would also include the header file for those panel
components.</p><p>Next, inside of our main routine, we declare a
<b  >Frame</b> variable, which is used by XView as a
place to put other components. It becomes an invisible layer
between our text sub-window and the window decorations from the
window manager.</p><p>Next, we call <span   class="bold"><b>xv_init</b></span> to
initialize XView and pass the command-line arguments to it. (Check
the <span   class="bold"><b>xview</b></span> man page for all the
command-line options.) With this xv_init call, we first come upon a
strong theme that runs through all XView calls&mdash;a null terminated
list of attribute, value pairs. The first argument to xv_init is
defined in the XView headers.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv_init</b></span> expects to see two more
arguments: the address of main's argument count and the argument
values. To tell xv_init that we have nothing more for it to do, we
pass one final argument of <b  >NULL</b> to terminate the
argument list.</p><p>On the next line, we create our frame, using
<span   class="bold"><b>xv_create</b></span>. In the first argument
we specify the parent of this component. Since we're just creating
the outermost frame, we have no parent, and we use
<b  >XV_NULL</b>. The second argument specifies the type
of component we want to create, in this case a
<b  >FRAME</b>. Notice that the remaining arguments form
a null-terminated list of following attribute, value pairs. For
example, the following attribute, value pair:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FRAME_LABEL, argv[0]
</pre><p>sets the label of the frame, which becomes the text on the
window's title bar. If we wanted to set the size of the frame on
the screen, we would simply add two pairs to set the width and
height (before the terminating NULL):
<pre     class="programlisting">
XV_HEIGHT, 200,
XV_WIDTH, 400,
</pre>


Similar attributes are used to set the maximum and minimum sizes of
the frame, the initial position on the screen, the header and
footer, etc.
</p><p>Moving on, we create the text sub-window. We pass in our
frame variable to this <b  >xv_create</b> call, because
we want the frame to become the parent of the text sub-window,
affecting its size and position. The type of component we're
creating is <b  >TEXTSW</b> for a text sub-window, and we
are adding no other options to it (although many are
available).</p><p>Next, we call <span   class="bold"><b>xv_main_loop</b></span>,
which handles all X events for the window that appears on the
screen. It calls lower-level <span   class="bold"><b>xlib</b></span>
routines to create the window, slider and canvas. It listens for
mouse and keyboard input and handles it.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv_main_loop</b></span> doesn't return until
the window is closed by the user. At that point, our program can
quietly exit.</p><p>Before we go further, there are two other important XView
routines we need to know: <span   class="bold"><b>xv_set</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>xv_get</b></span>. As their names imply,
they are used to set and to get attribute values for XView
components.</p><p>In sample.c, we saw how to set the size of the frame when it
was created. We also could have set the size after it was created
with the <b  >xv_set</b> call in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xv_set(frame,
        XV_HEIGHT, 200,
        XV_WIDTH,  400,
        NULL);
</pre><p>Although the vertical formatting isn't necessary, it shows
more clearly what is happening: namely, using the
<b  >frame</b> component, we have set its height to 200
and its width to 400.
</p><p>Suppose that at some point in the program, we needed to
determine the position of the frame on the screen:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int     x, y;
x = (int)xv_get(frame, XV_X);
y = (int)xv_get(frame, XV_Y);
</pre><p>This fragment retrieves the x and y coordinates of the frame
on the screen. Yes, it looks like we violated the rule of using a
null-terminated list, but since xv_get returns a single value, we
fetch only one attribute; therefore, xv_get accepts only two
arguments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2927580.0x2a202c0"></a>Second Version with Callbacks</h2></div></div><p>Let's extend this sample program by adding two buttons to it.
One button will insert a fixed text string into the text
sub-window, and the other button will erase the text sub-window. To
do this, we will need a place to put them: namely, a control panel
which is implemented in the PANEL package. The buttons themselves
are panel items called PANEL_BUTTONs. We associate a subroutine, or
&ldquo;callback&rdquo; routine, with a button, to be called when the user
clicks on the button. The callback routines will manipulate the
text sub-window. The second version of the sample.c program is
shown in <a href="2035l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>Let's start with the new code inside our main. We created a
panel inside the frame, positioned in the upper-left corner (x=0,
y=0), extending to the right edge, 30 pixels tall and
borderless.</p><p>Next, we added two buttons to the panel (not the frame), each
with different button labels and different callback routines. For
this example, XView handles the chore of positioning the buttons
within the panel. If we wanted, we could use the XV_X and XV_Y
attributes to position the buttons within the control panel.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2035f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Hierarchy in the Window
</p></div></div><p>Note that a hierarchy (see Figure 1) is forming. The frame is
a parent of the panel and the text sub-window. The panel is a
parent of the two buttons. When we resize the frame, its child
components resize with it. The user interface could become quite
sophisticated (i.e., complex) but still remain manageable, because
of the relations that form among the frames, panels and other
components. Our callback routines are invoked by other routines
deep within XView and are passed the component and the event that
produced this call (in this simple case, the button and the
mouse-button-up event).</p><p>For the <span   class="bold"><b>insert string</b></span>
callback routine, we use the global handle to the text sub-window
and call an auxiliary routine to insert the literal text into the
text pane. For the <span   class="bold"><b>clear_window</b></span>
callback routine, we use another helper function to reset the text
sub-window, which erases all the text from its pane. Although we
use xv_set and xv_get to manipulate the attributes of the XView
components, some components have a nice set of helper functions to
make our job easier. The text sub-window is one such
component.</p><p>Although this sample program doesn't give you an
earth-shattering application, it does show you the core features of
XView:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>attribute,value pairs</p></li><li><p>null-terminated lists</p></li><li><p>xv_init and xv_main_loop for setup and event
handling</p></li><li><p>xv_create, xv_set, xv_get for component
attributes</p></li><li><p>callback functions for event handling</p></li></ul></div><p>This article has demonstrated the simplicity, elegance and
beauty of XView. Perhaps you will be inspired to look into it
further.</p><p><a href="2035s1.html" target="_self">XView Components</a></p><p><a href="2035s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
