<i  >LJ</i>, for the accuracy of the information it
gives and the nice tone it uses.</p><p>I write you in reaction to the &ldquo;1997 Readers' Choice Award&rdquo;
that the text editor vi received in the December issue. I'm an old
addict of this program, and I still find it fast and useful. But I
have always promised myself that I would learn Emacs one of these
days, thinking I couldn't remain an old dinosaur using such an old
tool. The problem is that I always found Emacs far too complicated.
So when I saw the Award, I was genuinely surprised so many people
think like me and I had a good laugh.</p><p>In short, after reading <i  >LJ</i>, I decided
that, despite vi being an old and ugly editor, I'll keep using it
without any remorse for being an Emacs loser. &mdash;Pierre-Philippe

of the <i  >LJ</i> readers would be interested in this
information.</p><p>Since March 1997, I have owned a 520D, which uses a
Chips&amp;Technologies 6555x for its video chip set. It runs
XFree86 just fine with up to 64K colors at 800x600 (virtual up to
1600x1200@8bpp), and acceleration using the SVGA server. I don't
know if this model is still current; however, it's almost the same

suggested a way to mix Linux and NT. Here's another way using the

/dev/hda2, and that /dev/hda1 is mounted on /dosc.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>In Linux, edit the /etc/lilo.conf file so that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Support&rdquo;, November 1997. Shells like bash and zsh perform their
own line editing, and to do this they need to know how long the
prompt is. With Jim's PS1, bash thinks the prompt is 15 characters
longer than it actually is, because the colour setting escape
sequences don't take up any screen space. This can easily be seen
when typing a command which reaches column 65, because bash assumes
it is actually at column 80 and wraps the text at that point. The
real solution is listed in bash's man page under PROMPTING:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><b  >\[</b> begin a sequence of
non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal
control sequence into the prompt.<b  >\]</b> end a
sequence of non-printing characters.</p></blockquote></div><p>Jim's prompt then becomes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
\[\033[36m\]\u_\[\033[33m\]\W_\$_--\[\033[32m\]_
</pre>


where &ldquo;_&rdquo; is a space. &mdash;Carey Evans c.evans@clear.net.nz
</p><p>Yes, you are correct. My solution does address one problem
but upon re-reading Jim's question, I realize that it will not
solve his. Your solution is the correct one. Thanks Carey. &mdash;Chad
Robinson chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6e580.0x1e66d98"></a>Linux in the Mainstream?</h2></div></div><p>I was reading the article in <i  >Linux Journal</i> #43 called &ldquo;Linux in the Mainstream?&rdquo; by Phil
Hughes. As a Linux user I do like the idea of Linux becoming more
mainstream. However, I don't agree with the suggestions that Mr.
Hughes makes. Linux is something different, that's why we use
it&mdash;well, why I and many others use it. Linux started as a small
project and was taken on by a large community. It is not like other
operating systems. There is no need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span>
Linux mainstream&mdash;Linux is becoming mainstream on its own power.
This is not because of marketing&mdash;it is because Linux is a damn
fine OS, and people are finding that out by word of mouth. We, as a
community, should not look into marketing and certification
programs, but rather we should keep right on with what we have been
doing&mdash;telling others about this great OS. We don't need a central
authority to hand out meaningless sheets of paper.</p><p>I am not saying that Linux is not lacking in some areas. It
most certainly is, but as a community we should be working on the
shortcomings simply for the sake of making a better, free, OS&mdash;not
to win over new users. &mdash;Steve Carpenter sjc@delphi.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6e580.0x1e66fa8"></a>SCO Unix Review</h2></div></div><p>I really appreciated your recent review of SCO OpenServer.
Where I work, we recently had reason to take a computer that had
Linux on it and make it into a dual Linux/SCO system. I would like
to point out, however, an error in the review. Ken says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>While you're going through this process,
OpenServer is merrily overwriting your master boot record and
wiping it free of LILO.</p></blockquote></div><p>While it is true that SCO overwrites LILO if you have it
installed on the Master Boot Record (MBR), it is not true that LILO
cannot boot SCO. In fact LILO is more than happy to boot SCO. The
problem is that SCO expects its own partition to be active or
bootable. From the README file for LILO:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Some PC UNIX systems (SCO and Unixware have been
reported to exhibit this problem) depend on their partition being
active. Such a setup can currently only be obtained by installing
LILO as the MBR and making the respective partition active.</p></blockquote></div><p>If, after you install SCO, you reinstall LILO to the MBR and
make the SCO partition bootable, LILO will very easily allow you to
choose one or the other at boot time. On our setup, we have Linux
installed to /dev/hda2 and SCO on /dev/hda4. Our lilo.conf file,
therefore, looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
message=/boot/boot.msg
prompt
timeout=100
#
# Linux partition
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=linux
        root=/dev/hda2
        read-only
#
# SCO Unix partition
other=/dev/hda4
        label=sco
        table=/dev/hda
</pre><p>Upon bootup, LILO runs and displays our boot.msg file which
tells the user how to load either Linux or SCO. This has worked out
quite nicely for us. In the past, we had installed SCO on a machine
that also used MS-DOS and the only way to switch between the
operating systems was by using FDISK to toggle between the
partitions. It's nice to see that Linux and its tools are still
better than anything else out there.  &mdash;Tanner

Editor&rdquo; in the December 1997, Issue 44. But you introduced a huge
mistake in it, which can have security implications for readers who
blindly trust <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>The message, published under the title &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;,
mentions the <b  >-T</b> option of the Perl interpreter,
saying that &ldquo;<b  >-T</b> tests that the file type is
text, not binary.&rdquo; This is ridiculous and I never wrote that. I
wrote that every Perl CGI programmer should use the
<b  >-T</b> option and explained that it refers to
tainted mode (man perlsec for details). The <b  >-T</b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>option</em></span> (a command-line flag) has nothing to do
with the <b  >-T</b> <span   class="emphasis"><em>function</em></span> (which
indeed tests if a file is text). Any Perl programmer could have
caught that mistake.</p><p>It seems to me that the treatment of my alert message
(remember that anyone on the Internet could execute any command on
a machine which uses the scripts you originally published)
exhibited two serious flaws:</p><p>It was treated too slowly. Most people trust paper more than
Usenet News or WWW. Many people probably assumed that the articles
in <i  >LJ</i> were carefully scrutinized and that the
scripts were dependable. <i  >LJ</i> had, in my
opinion, a responsibility to warn users as soon as possible (at
least in the next issue) of the mistake and not through a letter to
the editor two issues later.</p><p>It is perfectly understandable that you edited my message; I
know that my English is quite poor. But you could have sent it back
to me for a last check. I do not think it is ethical to modify a
message, not on a grammatical point but on a technical one, and to
publish it without showing to the readers the edited parts and
without sending it to the author for proofreading. &mdash;Stephane
Bortzmeyer bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr</p><p>First, let me apologize for your letter getting changed in a
way that changed technical content. We try hard not to let this
happen. One of our copy editors thought the <b  >-T</b>
needed more explanation and obviously grabbed the information from
the wrong place. I agree he should not have added to the text
without consulting you. If you had put as much detail in the first
letter as you did above, I don't think he would have felt he needed
to add anything. Ultimately, though, I did let his addition pass,
and I take full responsibility for the error.</p><p>LTE is just about the last column I put together.
Consequently, there is not a lot of time to pass it back and forth.
It is also the first time I even see the letters, so they can be
old. By the time a magazine comes out, the next issue is already at
the printer, so errors never get corrected until two issues later.
It's too bad, but such is the way of magazine deadlines.</p><p>Actually, I think you do quite well with your
English &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6e580.0x1e67aa8"></a>Fan Mail</h2></div></div><p>Just wanted to let you know that <i  >Linux Journal</i> continues to be startlingly good. I'd say that
70% of your articles are of immediate interest to me each month,
and the other 30% get re-discovered as useful knowledge when I go
through my back issues. It's like you guys can read my mind! Keep
up the amazing work. &mdash;Manni Wood mwood@sig.bsh.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6e580.0x1e67c08"></a>From the Publisher</h2></div></div><p>I got a chuckle out of your &ldquo;From The Publisher&rdquo; article on
page 10 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Issue 43 (Nov 97).
It sounds as if IBM is relegated to the past. We have three IBM
AS/400s (64 bit RISC) and 600 users, mostly on Windows 95 clients.
IBM has passed Intel and Microsoft in both hardware and software
terms (stop by http://www.as400.ibm.com/). OS/400 (V3R2 and later)
has everything a company needs to do relational database
Intranet/Internet applications. I'm using Net.Data (which is
available on many platforms; see http://www.as400.ibm.com/netdata/)
to do Provider lookups, map engine address lookups, etc. The
inclusion of Java in V4R2 and IBM's business class libraries makes
the AS/400 a very reliable database platform for the future. We
have one table with over 28 million records, and I'm not quite
ready to trust the MS SQL server to handle it.</p><p>How do you get Linux to be more mainstream? You have hackers
like me who are established in the corporate world. I'm installing
Linux to test JBuilder Java applets at home. (I want applications
to run on AS/400, NT and Linux without modification.) I have a
small network with NT server 4, NT workstation 4, Windows 98 beta
and a P150 class laptop with NT workstation. I'm dumping my Windows
98 machine (486/66) to load Slackware Linux. I'm hoping for much
better performance. &mdash;Steven P. Goldsmith fcci@cirs.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d6e580.0x2260010"></a>SAMBA</h2></div></div><p>I was disappointed with the article &ldquo;Using SAMBA to Mount
Windows95&rdquo; in the November issue. It gets a number of basic facts
wrong.</p><p>For a start, SAMBA does not do what the article claims it
does. The author is actually talking about a kernel-based SMB file
system called <span   class="bold"><b>smbfs</b></span> written and
maintained by Volker Lendecke (among others). Volker is a member of
the SAMBA Team, but smbfs is definitely not a part of SAMBA. SAMBA
is an SMB file server portable to all Unices, whereas smbfs is
currently for Linux only.</p><p>The article also says that &ldquo;SAMBA is a program that allows
Linux to talk to computers running Windows for Workgroups, Windows
95, Windows NT, Mac OS and Novell Netware.&rdquo; The bit about the
various Microsoft operating systems is partly right (although he
actually meant smbfs) but the part about Mac OS and Novell Netware
is totally wrong. For those he is probably referring to MARS_NWE,
ncpfs and Netatalk, which are totally separate packages that talk
totally different protocols. Perhaps if you are publishing articles
on a topic which <i  >Linux Journal</i> editors are not
very familiar with (there is a lot to know about Linux), you should
send a copy to someone who is familiar with the topic so they can
do a quick check and point out any obvious errors. &mdash;Andrew
Tridgell andrew.tridgell@anu.edu.au</p><p>Well, you caught me&mdash;I don't know everything about Linux.
However, to make up for this, I do send articles to copy editors
who have given me their areas of expertise. The copy editor who
worked on this article was a networking expert. I'll keep you in
mind for the next SAMBA article that comes in. &mdash;Editor</p></div></div>
