    This article presents a detailed tutorial on setting up an
    ISDN link to the Internet with Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>A typical question on comp.os.linux.* is
&ldquo;Do I need to get an ISDN driver for Linux to make my
Bitsurfr/ISDN router work?&rdquo; There are a lot of misconceptions
about the requirements to get connected using Linux and ISDN. This
article defines ISDN and explains some of the terms (see Glossary)
involved, as well as describing three different ISDN device types
and how to get Linux to use them to get on the Net. There is no
time like the present to graduate to a 64K or 128K ISDN Internet
connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238b558"></a>What is ISDN and How Does it Work?</h2></div></div><p>ISDN, or Integrated Services Digital Network, is
telecommunications technology that provides the end user with a
method for connecting to the phone network using digital signals.
It was originally designed to replace the POTS system; however, it
never caught on (in North America at least) for standard phone use
because there are different implementations of the ISDN standard.
However, with the advent of the Internet, ISDN is starting to take
off as a solution for the average user to get high-speed Internet
access. There are other digital connections available such as cable
modems and ADSL; however, ISDN is here now and available almost
everywhere.</p><p>ISDN is delivered as BRI service with two 64K B (data)
channels and one 16K D (signaling) channel. Some telcos still only
provide one B channel, however, this is becoming rare. BRI lines
are typically used by small business and individuals.</p><p>For the corporate user with a PBX or an access router, a PRI
would be used. A PRI consists, in North America of 23 64K B
channels and one 64K D, and in Europe, 30 64K D channels and one
64K D channel. This is the ISDN equivalent to a T1 or E1.</p><p>In North America, telcos deliver the ISDN BRI line as a U
interface. This is a two-wire link that easily works over the
standard pair of copper wires used by analog phone lines. In
Europe, telcos typically deliver the line as an S/T interface. This
is a four-wire link that is able to connect seven ISDN devices to
the same line. The U interface requires an NT1 adapter to switch
the S/T interface. Where the S/T interface is delivered, the NT1
resides at the telco's switch. Most ISDN products destined for
North America also incorporate the NT1, thereby saving money and
desk space.</p><p>The big benefit of ISDN is the small call setup time; that
is, the time elapsed between when the phone number is dialed and
when the connection is completed. This is made possible by the use
of out-of-band signaling via the D channel. The D channel signals
the telco's switch to make a call and, in less than one second, the
connection is made. The POTS service uses in-band signaling. When a
modem dials a system, it picks up the line and sends tones or
pulses in the same band as the data travels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238b7c0"></a>Getting Your ISDN Line</h2></div></div><p>ISDN terminal adapter user's guides give you the impression
that getting ISDN is difficult. If you ask the right questions,
obtaining your ISDN line can be easy. When ordering the line,
ask:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Does the BRI have two B channels? (almost always
yes.)</p></li><li><p>What switch type should I tell my TA to use? (In
Canada, usually NI-1.)</p></li><li><p>Is it delivered as a U or S interface? Do I need an
NT1? (If you have a line delivered as a U interface you must ensure
your terminal adapter has an NT1 built in, otherwise, a separate
NT1 is required.)</p></li></ul></div><p>Check the pricing of ISDN in your area. In some places in the
US, Frame Relay connections are cheaper than ISDN. ISDN is
typically charged on a per-minute basis as well. For example, Bell
Canada's Z@P service charges $1/hour per B channel to a maximum of
$50/month per B channel between certain hours.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238bb88"></a>Selecting a Terminal Adapter</h2></div></div><p>This is the expensive part of getting ISDN. Typically, a
terminal adapter ranges in price from $300 to several thousand
dollars depending on the type, features and functionality.</p><p>There are three basic types of terminal adapters: ISDN
routers, external ISDN modems and internal ISDN network adapters.
Most terminal adapters today provide POTS jacks for connecting a
standard analog phone device. These jacks give you a place to
connect a fax machine or an analog modem.</p><p>The type of terminal adapter you buy generally depends on the
amount of money you wish to spend. The best device to get depends
on your application and budget. An ISDN router is generally easiest
to configure and set up, but tend to be a bit more pricey. ISDN
modems and network adapters require a bit more work as they require
additional software, but tend to be more in the price range of an
individual. However, with an ISDN router, it's merely a matter of
connecting it to your Ethernet card and you are on-line. ISDN
modems and network adapters tend to take a bit more work to get
online.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238bd40"></a>Getting an ISDN Account with Your ISP</h2></div></div><p>ISDN dial-up accounts tend to be more expensive than a 28.8K
connection. This is changing as more and more ISPs convert to
access routers supporting both ISDN and 28.8K connections off the
same ISDN line. UUNET Technologies (in the U.S.) and UUNET Canada
offer ISDN access using this type of technology.</p><p>When you call an ISP to get an ISDN account, you need to
learn a bit about their service. Ask them what ISDN router they are
using. This information can be helpful in tracking down problems
should they occur. Not every ISDN router will talk to all other
ISDN routers. The Ascend MAX is popular among ISPs. If they permit
a 128K 2B account, make sure they support MPPP (Multilink
PPP).</p><p>Also consider the type of service you need. Most ISPs offer
either dedicated or dial-up ISDN. Dedicated services give you a
line on the ISP's router for your use only. They typically also
allocate you a block of IP numbers with the service. You need a
fixed IP number if you intend to pick up SMTP mail over the link.
Dial-up situations tend to use dynamic IP assignments, which means
you are assigned a different IP number on each call. A few ISPs
assign you a single IP number for your use. While this is rare, it
is a method allowing pickup of SMTP mail over a dial-up account
without using UUCP. How you intend to access the net and for what
purpose will determine the type of account you need.</p><p>Network Address Translation, or IP Masquarade as it is called
by the Linux kernel, is required by a router to provide access to
multiple systems to a single dial-up ISDN account. In the case of
an ISDN modem or an ISDN Network Adapter, the Linux kernel deals
with the translation. If you are assigned a class C block or a
point-to-point number by your ISP, address translation is not
required.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238bf50"></a>To Compress or Not to Compress</h2></div></div><p>The most recent ISDN devices feature some form of
compression. Their marketing departments will say that compression
will lead to increased throughput on the order of two to four
times. They claim a 128K line will seem to run at 256K. Don't be
fooled. In real live situations, you will be lucky to perceive an
increase of 10%. Consider most information the device will be
downloading is already compressed, and therefore, cannot be
compressed further (or at least very little). JPEG and GIF files
from the web are already compressed, and most ftp archives are
either zipped or gzipped, tar files. Only text benefits greatly
from compression, and text is usually only about 20% of the data on
a web page.</p><p>Thus, when shopping for an ISDN device, don't place
compression high on your priority list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238c0b0"></a>Using an ISDN Router</h2></div></div><p>An ISDN router is the easy way to get connected&mdash;enter in a
few bits of information into the router's configuration, and you
are on the Net. A router is the best method to get a LAN talking to
the Internet, as this is a dedicated computer designed to handle
the load of passing packets. The only drawback can be the price.
For most individual users, an ISDN router will be beyond the reach
of their pocketbook. For business, a router is essential for
reliability.</p><p>To get started, you need to obtain a network card and install
it; refer to the Ethernet Mini-HOWTO for details.</p><p>The best Ethernet card to use is one with a memory buffer, as
it gives the best performance. Most routers come with a twisted
10baseT cable to connect your router directly to your Ethernet
card. If you intend to connect more than one computer, an Ethernet
hub is required. Avoid 10base2 (coax) cabling, if at all possible,
to avoid hassles. It may be cheaper initially, but it can lead to
diagnostic and cabling nightmares.</p><p>Two ISDN routers I have worked with and found reliable are
the Ascend Pipeline 50 and the Farallon Netopia.</p><p>The Ascend Pipeline series is well suited for dedicated ISDN
applications, as it was originally designed for routing a netblock
or a static IP number. The Ascent router supports address
translation; something Ascend calls NAT (Network Address
Translation). If POTS jacks are required, then consider the
Pipeline 75 which is basically the Pipeline 50 with POTS
jacks.</p><p>The Farallon Netopia is, by far, one of the easiest routers
to configure. The Netopia supports dedicated connections and
supports Farallon's version of address translation, called SmartIP,
for use with dial-up applications. The Netopia comes in a 12-user
version as well as a full routing version. Two POTS jacks are
available as an option. What makes this router unique is its PC
Card (PCMCIA) slot. Insert a PC Card modem, and the router can be
dialed into even when the ISDN connection is down. This is very
handy for those users who require remote configuration and
troubleshooting abilities. The Netopia also includes a scheduler,
so that connections can be scheduled for variable times during the
week. No other ISDN router I've used has this feature.</p><p>The Ascend Pipeline series is the most popular, and most ISPs
are either currently using them or have worked with them in the
past. The Netopia is newer, and its feature set makes it worth
noting. Of the many routers I have worked with, the Ascend and
Farallon products have most impressed me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x238c3c8"></a>External ISDN Modems</h2></div></div><p>A fair amount of confusion lies in this area. A typical
question on comp.os.linux.networking is &ldquo;Do I have to include ISDN
support to operate my Bitsurfr ISDN modem?&rdquo; Nope. An ISDN modem is
a serial device that connects to the serial port on your PC,
&ldquo;dials&rdquo; a phone number and translates ISDN data to RS-232 data.
The system sees it as a regular modem. You can set up
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> to answer incoming calls,
and you can dial out with <span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>. ISDN kernel support is
neither required nor used. Note that the term &ldquo;modem&rdquo; does not
really apply to an ISDN terminal adapter, because &ldquo;modem&rdquo; implies
an analog device which an ISDN TA is not.</p><p>The Motorola Bitsurfr Pro is one such ISDN modem. I will
discuss its connection to a Linux system in detail, because it has
been around for quite some time and works well. It features a
115Kbps serial port and two POTS jacks. Newer ISDN modems may
include a 230Kbps or higher serial port and compression (such as
the Farallon Netmodem).</p><p>The test system for the Bitsurfr Pro was a Pentium 100 with
32MB of memory running Linux 2.0.28. The connection was provided by
UUNET Canada and both a dedicated connection as well as a dial-up
connection were tested. Both situations worked well with one or two
B channels operating. The following procedure outlines setting up
Linux to talk to the Bitsurfr Pro over the serial port and
configuring pppd to use it.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Connect the Bitsurfr Pro to the system and the ISDN
line.</p></li><li><p>Configure the serial port with
<span   class="bold"><b>setserial</b></span> as required (e.g.,
<b  >setserial /dev/cua1 spd_vhi hup_notify</b>). See the
Serial HOW-TO for details.</p></li><li><p>Now the fun part: configuring the Bitsurfr Pro. The
Bitsurfr Pro requires a full VT100-compliant terminal emulator to
use its local menu. During my testing, I have found only Seyon to
work&mdash;Minicom did not work for me&mdash;run Seyon (i.e., <b  >seyon
- modems/dev/cua1</b>). Type <b  >AT</b> to get the
Bitsurfr's attention. Then type <b  >AT@MENU</b>. The
local menu will appear as shown in <a href="2182f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure
1</a>.</p></li><li><p>From the NET SWITCH menu, set up the switch type
and the SPIDs (i.e., the ISDN phone line numbers). The directory
numbers are required only if you intend to dial into the Bitsurfr.
The Data SPID and Voice SPID2 should be made the same. Selecting
&ldquo;Port To Configure&rdquo; selects which SPID to set up. Select &ldquo;Reset
Network Link&rdquo; after the SPIDs are entered to start the Bitsurfr
talking to the ISDN switch. If all goes well, the LS (link status)
light will turn solid green. This can take as long as two minutes
to occur.</p></li><li><p>From the CALL SETUP menu, set the B Channel Speed
to 64K unless ISDN in your area does not support 64K. Basically, if
calls cannot be made, reduce this setting to 56K.</p></li><li><p>From the PROTOCOLS menu, set &ldquo;Rate Adaption
Protocol&rdquo; to PPPC.</p></li><li><p>From the LOAD/SAVE menu, select &ldquo;Save Total Active
Profile&rdquo; and save it to Profile 0 and Profile 1.</p></li><li><p>Install pppd.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> comes with a
sample script in the scripts directory of its source tree. Copy
<span   class="bold"><b>ppp-off</b></span> to the the /etc/ppp
directory; ppp-off is used unchanged.</p></li><li><p>Refer to <a href="2182l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>. Create the scripts as listed in the /etc/ppp directory.
These are modified versions of the pppd ppp-on and ppp-on-dialer
scripts. The ppp-on script runs pppd and the ppp-on-dialer dials
the phone number. The ppp-on-dialer also controls the number of B
channels the Bitsurfr uses. Most dial-up ISPs only permit one B
channel usage. Check with your ISP for details. For two channels,
the Bitsurfr must be told to use MPPP instead of PPP and must be
given two phone numbers with the ATD command.</p></li><li><p>Create an options file as in
<a href="2182l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. The debug option is
useful for initial testing. Watch your syslog for messages from
pppd. The name option is required to identify who you are in the
chap-secrets file.</p></li><li><p>Create the chap-secrets and pap-secrets files. The
contents should be the same in most cases.
<a href="2182l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> shows an example. The
chap and pap-secrets should have the same contents and should list
every router on the remote end. In the example, most routers on
UUNET's Alterdial POP in Toronto (Canada) are listed. To determine
the remote router names, when connecting, monitor the syslog. The
names are reported as part of the negotiations. This is an easy way
to build a router list. Alternatively, call your ISP and ask for
this information. ISDN routers do not issue normal login prompts
and rely on chap or pap for authentication. Even if a login prompt
were issued, it would not appear through the Bitsurfr's PPP
support. All routers are listed twice in reverse order in case
bi-directional CHAP or PAP is requested. (Cisco routers tend to
default to two-way CHAP.) If you have a dedicated connection, you
need list only the one router you are dialing in to; otherwise, you
have to list all the routers you may hit in your dial-up
connection.</p></li><li><p>Go on-line by running the ppp-on script. If all
goes well, you'll get connected. The DTE (data terminal equipment)
light will flash while the Bitsurfr is dialing and glow solid green
when the ISDN portion of the link is active. The total time from
dialing to authentication is about 2 to 8 seconds depending on the
load on the remote routers.</p></li><li><p>Surf's up! Check the routing table to make sure a
default route exists (i.e., run <b  >netstat -rn</b>). If
it does, <span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> something on the
Internet. Your packets should be returned.</p></li></ol></div><p>For a dial-up connection, you might want to go one step
further and install <span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span>, the
Linux dialer daemon, to make your Internet connection automatic
when Internet traffic is sensed.</p><p>There are a few problems that might occur in getting
connected with Bitsurfr Pro. Incorrect SPIDs is the most common
problem. Check with your telco for the correct format of the SPIDs.
Secondly, a typo in the scripts will cause various weirdness. For
example, an error in the phone number in the ppp-on-dialer can
cause certain grief. Lastly, if the pap-secrets file is not set up
correctly, it will cause authentication problems and failed
connects. This error type will be noted in the syslog output from
pppd when the debug option is enabled. Obviously, a lot of detail
is missing from the above instructions; however, after some
experimentation, things should start working. Check the PPP HOWTO
for more details, as getting the Bitsurfr working is mostly a fight
with pppd.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x2383e90"></a>ISDN Network Adapters</h2></div></div><p>There are a number of ISDN network adapters on the market. As
the Linux kernel advances to 2.2, additional devices are being
supported by the Linux built-in ISDN support. I should mention that
an ISDN network adapter is not a modem. It does not consume a
serial port and thus does not have the speed limitations problems
of a serial port. One such ISDN network adapter is the SpellCaster
DataCommute/BRI. SpellCaster is a Canadian company that is
developing the Linux driver and is targeting the Linux market for
their product. The card was reviewed recently in the October 1997
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>An ISDN network adapter is an ideal solution for someone who
cannot afford a full-fledged ISDN router and who does not want to
be bogged down by a serial port's overhead. ISDN Network Adapters
typically have high throughput compared to an ISDN modem. For
example, the SpellCaster card uses a 16K memory buffer to transfer
data from the ISDN line to the system and so generates fewer
interrupts. Also, the card is not limited to 115K of a serial port.
A two-B channel connection with an ISDN network adapter is usually
at the full 128K speed. Yes, there are now higher speed serial
ports; however, any non-intelligent serial card requires the
processor's attention more often than an ISDN network
adapter.</p><p>An ISDN network adapter can also be used to roll your own
ISDN router; out of Linux. Linux's firewall support is exceptional.
This, perhaps, can give that old 386-40 a new lease on life. An
ISDN modem also can be used to roll out a router, however, an
intelligent serial card would be required to get comparable
performance.</p><p>To demonstrate the setup of an ISDN network adapter, I will
discuss the installation and use of the SpellCaster
DataCommute/BRI. The DataCommute uses the ISDN4Linux support of the
2.x kernels. At the time of this writing, SpellCaster is hard at
work on a new driver named Babylon, currently available in beta
release. It promises to provide additional functionally and
overcome some of the shortcomings of ISDN4Linux. Babylon also
promises to be easier to set up as the biggest hurdle in getting
the DataCommute to work is understanding the ISDN4Linux
operation.</p><p>The same test system was used to test the SpellCaster
DataCommute/BRI. Both dedicated and dial-up situations were tried
again to UUNET Canada's ISDN service. The dedicated setup proved to
be very fast. Transfer rates greater then an ISDN router were
observed.</p><p>Setting up the SpellCaster DataCommute/BRI:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Compile your 2.x kernel with ISDN support. Run
<b  >make config</b> and say YES to: &ldquo;ISDN Support&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Support Synchronous PPP&rdquo;, &ldquo;Use VJ-compression with Synchronous
PPP&rdquo; and &ldquo;Support generic MP&rdquo;. Compile and install the new
kernel.</p></li><li><p>Download the current driver and the ISDN4Linux
support files from the SpellCaster web page (see Resources). The
driver is the one named scis not dcbri.</p></li><li><p>Extract the driver and compile it by typing
<b  >make</b> in the driver's /src directory. This
creates two executable files,
<span   class="bold"><b>scctrl</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sctrace</b></span>, along with the driver
module, sc.o. Use scctrl to configure the DataCommute for the
correct ISDN switch type and SPIDs.</p></li><li><p>As root, run <b  >make install</b> to
install the driver to the /lib/modules directory. Change the setup
for your Linux distribution to have the driver load automatically
on the next boot and then insert it into memory for this session
(e.g., <b  >insmod sc.o</b>).</p></li><li><p>Extract the ISDN4Linux package and compile it by
typing <b  >make</b>. As root, run <b  >make
install</b> to install the ISDN4Linux files. This will place
<span   class="bold"><b>ipppd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>isdnctrl</b></span> in the /sbin directory
along with other programs. <span   class="bold"><b>ipppd</b></span>
is the synchronous version of pppd.
<span   class="bold"><b>isdnctrl</b></span> sets up the ISDN
interface and talks to ipppd to control the ISDN link.</p></li><li><p>Perform the following tasks with
<span   class="bold"><b>scctl</b></span> as root:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Reset the DataCommute by typing <b  >scctl
-r</b>. All the lights on the back of the card will go
out.</p></li><li><p>Start the firmware on the card by typing
<b  >scctrl -g</b>. The top light on the card will flash
to indicate the firmware is running.</p></li><li><p>Program the ISDN switch type by typing
<b  >scctl -w NI1</b> (Use your telco's switch type here;
type <b  >scctl -h</b> to see the available switch
types.)</p></li><li><p>Program the SPIDs and directory numbers:</p></li></ul></div>

<pre     class="programlisting">
scctl -c 1 -s 4165551234 -d 5551234\
        - the first channel
scctl -c 2 -s 4165551235 -d 5551235\
        - the second channel
</pre>


</p><p>If all went well, the top light on the card will be flashing
and the rest of the lights will be on, indicating the card has
negotiated with the ISDN switch successfully. Running
<b  >scctl -u</b> will also show the card's status. The
Switch Status will show CONNECTED. Some patience is required, as
the negitiation between the ISDN switch and your card can take up
to two minutes.</p><p>Note that once the card has been programmed for the ISDN
switch type and SPIDs, it need not be done again unless new
firmware is loaded into the card. Thus, the above is only done once
and not every time the system is booted.</p></li><li><p>Open another VT or Xterm and run
<b  >tail&lt;\!s&gt;-f&lt;\!s&gt;/var/log/messages</b>.
This will give a constant output of the syslog file.
<span   class="bold"><b>ipppd</b></span> outputs all debug
information to the syslog, and it's handy to see what's going on
while initially setting up the connection.</p></li><li><p>Type in the script shown in
<a href="2182l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, making the changes to
the phone numbers, etc., where appropriate, and save it as
<span   class="bold"><b>isdnsetup</b></span>. This script sets up the
ISDN subsystem and runs ipppd.</p></li><li><p>Finally, do steps 11 and 12 from the list shown
earlier for setting up Bitsurfr Pro.</p></li></ol></div><p>Assuming everthing has gone well, run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
isdnctrl dial ippp0
</pre><p>to dial up your ISP. If you have configured two B channels,
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
isndctrl addlink ippp0
</pre>


to bring up the second channel. To kill the connection at any time,
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
isdnctrl hangup ippp0
</pre>


Incidentally, the above procedure is by no means the standard for
configuring the ISDN subsystem and setting up a connection. With
some experimentation in the case where a dedicated link is used, it
should be possible to set up the link when the system is booted.
Check the man page for <span   class="bold"><b>isdnctrl</b></span>
for additional information. Be sure to disable the debug feature in
the isdnsetup script once everything is working to avoid filling up
the syslog file.
</p><p>There is one more thing to note about using the card. Some
PCI systems require that the BIOS be set up to reserve the IRQ and
memory space for the DataCommute/BRI; this was true in the case of
our test system. Generally, this is in the system setup under some
form of Plug and Play menu. Otherwise, this card just works and is
well worth the money.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2293580.0x2385648"></a>In Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There are three general methods of getting Linux on the Net
with ISDN: an ISDN router, an external ISDN modem and an internal
ISDN network adapter. The device you choose should be determined by
the function of the link, the time limit on getting the link up and
the cost of the device.</p><p>No matter which option you select, once you have an ISDN net
connection, you will never return to 28.8K&mdash;it's just too
slow!</p><p><a href="2182s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p><p><a href="2182s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
