    Mr. Aznar tells us all about the developers' plans for a
    friendly window manager called AfterStep.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x166a580.0x1762450"></a></h2></div></div><p>It seems like only yesterday that I was
asked to write an article about AfterStep for
<i  >LJ</i>'s special issue on GUIs (graphical user
interfaces), and now here it is. The main points I will focus on
are the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>History of window managers and in particular
AfterStep</p></li><li><p>The future of AfterStep</p></li><li><p>Desktop philosophy of AfterStep 1.3.1</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>My conclusion is that the best GUI is the most productive
one, but only if it remains user friendly. Users must be free to do
anything easily using their window manager.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x166a580.0x1762870"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>The first window manager was TWM from Evans and Sutherland,
and it was the base upon which Robert Nation created FVWM. FVWM has
been used to create most of the modern window managers: FVWM2,
Enlightenment, amiWM and Bowman. FVWM2 was used as the basis for
FVWM95, and Bowman evolved into AfterStep. In this &ldquo;tree&rdquo;
hierarchy, some exceptions appear: WindowMaker, the NeXT emulation
window manager; and KWM, the KDE project window manager. Both of
these managers were written from scratch.</p><p>Is starting at the beginning better than modifying an already
existing window manager? It may bring personal satisfaction, but it
will also create duplication of effort. Since all of these programs
(FVWM, Bowman, etc.) are freely redistributable, there's no need to
write the same code twice. If a feature you want already exists in
another window manager, just take the code and patch it into yours.
This method will save you both time and effort. FVWM already had
most of the features of the modern window managers. The concept has
progressed only slightly, while the appearance has radically
changed.</p><p>AfterStep, derived from both FVWM and Bowman, was first
written by Dan Weeks, Frank Fejes and Alfredo Kojima to emulate the
NeXT GUI. When they realized they couldn't put all the features
they wanted into AfterStep, a new project was started&mdash;WindowMaker.
WindowMaker is targeted at Gnustep (GNU approach to NeXT
programming and interface) with very innovative concepts, e.g.,
dock, DnD and &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; menus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x166a580.0x1762a28"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Even if it limits you in some ways, the ability to build on a
good base is very useful. You don't spend most of your time coding
a good equivalent of FVWM with many bugs. AfterStep is now evolving
toward new heights, including simpler and more powerful
configuration. Rather than maintaining AfterStep and allowing other
managers to pass it, we (the developers) want it to become the most
innovative window manager. For example, we're planning to add a few
new features. First, concepts that already exist in other window
managers that we plan to incorporate into AfterStep:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A file manager in the root window (see Win95 and
KDE) with an Irix-like desktop</p></li><li><p>WindowMaker Dock and &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; menus</p></li><li><p>Enlightenment-like window decorations with
pixmaps</p></li><li><p>FVWM95 task bar</p></li><li><p>OS/2-like voice recognition (see the ear voice
recognition project on Sunsite)</p></li></ul></div><p>The code for these features from other window managers can be
copied under the GPL (GNU Public License). I strongly believe in
and encourage maximum source code re-usage. I like the FVWM95 task
bar, Enlightenment decorations and WindowMaker dock DnD; they're
very useful and easy to use. Mixing and matching concepts from
several window managers will ultimately result in a
&ldquo;best-of-all-worlds&rdquo; situation. That goal is why some people
install and configure everything they find. Merging these features
into a single program is a much more efficient solution. Therefore,
the idea is to make AfterStep more friendly by including many
features into a homogeneous work. I hope we'll be able to meet most
individual tastes. And there's no need for coding in a new way
(C++, Gnustep, Qt, etc.) to meet such goals since most of these
cool features exist in FVWM parented window managers.</p><p><a href="2440f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
AfterStep Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>I'd also like to see some new features that are not yet
implemented in any window manager, with maybe a new way of coding.
That's why AfterStep will first integrate the FVWM family features
and then take a different path. New concepts that we wish to add
are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NeXT desktop, in collaboration with the WindowMaker
team</p></li><li><p>Module compatibility with FVWM2 and other window
managers</p></li><li><p>Object-oriented management of AfterStep elements
(title bar)</p></li><li><p>Animated icon and opaque window rotation</p></li><li><p>Total mouse configurability</p></li><li><p>Icons/help files/programs database (For example, a
painting program without a nice default icon would
&ldquo;auto-magically&rdquo; use a database icon containing a button for
calling <span   class="bold"><b>xman</b></span> with the program's
help file.)</p></li><li><p>Source code optimization to keep AfterStep from
becoming slow</p></li></ul></div><p>The sky is the limit. If you implement a good option in
AfterStep, just send me your patch and if it's freely
redistributable it'll be in the next version. If you think
AfterStep is going to become 100MB, don't worry&mdash;all of these are
compile time options. A patch is put in the executable program only
if you request it (that's what we call meeting personal tastes).
We're making AfterStep for ourselves, but one thing we also want is
features we haven't already imagined. All this may seem quite
ambitious, and we agree, we are. AfterStep's &ldquo;pilgrim fathers&rdquo;
already did a lot, making such a good program, so it's not easy to
make it even better.</p><p><a href="2440f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
AfterStep Screenshot</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x166a580.0x1763790"></a>Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>AfterStep 1.3.1 already includes user-friendly configuration
and &ldquo;look sharing&rdquo;. Here are some examples of the new features
already working:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Take your personal look file, rename it to
look.your-name and post it to your friends. They can put it in
desktop/looks and select it in the start menu to easily get the
appearance of your desktop without losing their own menus,
configuration or bindings.</p></li><li><p>The start menu is simply a directory in
~/gnustep/Library/AfterStep in which each subdirectory is a menu
entry and each file a menu option. If you want to add Ghostview,
just type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "gv &amp;" &gt;\
~/gnustep/Library/AfterStep/start/Programs/Ghostview
</pre>


</p><p>Spaces are allowed and you can specify command-line options.
When you restart AfterStep, Ghostview will be added to the start
menu.</p></li><li><p>Backgrounds are put in the directory
~/gnustep/Library/AfterStep/desktop/backgrounds. Put the picture
you want there and when you restart AfterStep, the
Desktop/Backgrounds/Pictures menu will contain this option. Of
course, if you select it, AfterStep will remember it for the next
session, just like colors (in desktop/colors) and look
files.</p></li><li><p>An included patched
<span   class="bold"><b>rxvt</b></span> called
<span   class="bold"><b>xiterm</b></span> allows pictures to be
displayed in the background with Offix DnD compatibility (just like
the Wharf). Select a file in <span   class="bold"><b>xfm</b></span>,
drag it to xiterm, and its name will appear on the command line
you're typing. It's lighter than xterm, supports color and will be
more linked with AfterStep in version 1.3.2, becoming a standard
part of its GUI, like title bars, Wharf and Pager. Configure-time
options are made via <span   class="bold"><b>menuconfig</b></span>
(just like the Linux kernel); this will also be true for future
versions of AfterStep.</p></li><li><p>Four 2x2 pagers (that's sixteen screens, but you
can configure it if you want more or less space on your desktop)
with individual background pixmaps and names to allow you to use
many programs at the same time (the task-list is very useful
too).</p></li><li><p>Jump button allows you to focus on the next window
by clicking on the right triangle in the right part of the title
bar.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you have learned in this article, AfterStep is strongly
linked to the FVWM family but is no longer restricted to NeXT GUI
emulation. Before moving to totally new concepts, we're first
trying to put in all the nice features that already exist without
making AfterStep hard to use. I hope you'll find 1.3.1 as simple to
use as I think it is. But remember, if you think of a missing
option, code it and send in the patch. With look files and other
configuration files, AfterStep can turn into anything you want it
to be.</p></div></div>
