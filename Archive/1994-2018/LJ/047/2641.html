builder that runs on most Unix/X workstations. It generates native
code for the OSF/Motif widget set, with sources either in C, C++ or
UIL, the Motif user interface language. Not just for Motif, it can
also produce code which compiles on Microsoft Windows platforms,
using the MFC class library for GUI elements. Sounds promising,
doesn't it? The very edition I had in my hand read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Designer release 4.6: Java Edition</em></span>--it can
produce Java code as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d0580.0x25c8c38"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, my excitement was growing as I opened the stylish
box and got ready to install this expensive piece of software on my
PC. Inside the box, I found a small manual called &ldquo;Installation
and Release Notes&rdquo;, a large book of 840 pages with the title
&ldquo;Release 4.6 User Guide&rdquo;, some advertisements and licensing
material, two reference cards and a white CD-ROM containing the
software.</p><p>The target PC was a 100MHz Pentium with 16MB RAM and 16 bpp
XFree3.2 server for the ATI Mach64 graphics adapter with 2MB
memory. This was more than enough memory for X-Designer. The Linux
residing on the PC disks was a Slackware 3.0 distribution with
2.0.0 kernel. I had no Motif, just freely available
<span   class="bold"><b>lesstif</b></span> libraries version 0.81.
After all, X-Designer manuals claimed that Motif is not needed for
running the builder and only Motif version 1.2 is needed for the
created applications, not the newer 2.0 version.</p><p>Installation was smooth and trouble-free. As soon as the
CD-ROM is mounted, X-Designer can be run in demo mode if the ISO
9660 Rock Ridge extensions are supported. The installation is done
with a single <span   class="bold"><b>Install</b></span> command,
where the only mandatory specifications are the location of the
LINUX distribution files (e.g., /cdrom/LINUX) and the destination
directory (/usr/local/xdesigner/ in my case). The installation took
about 21MB of disk space and was accomplished in a robust and
straightforward way. No fancy installation options, but you can
rely on its successful completion.</p><p>Immediately after installation, the X-Designer still ran only
in demo mode, which doesn't enable saving the designs or generating
any code. I proceeded to the licensing section of the installation
manual. To obtain the license, a special host ID must be calculated
with a provided program and e-mailed to IST for the license
request. The support staff responded within minutes. Using the very
good manual section about setting up the license file and running
the provided IST licensing daemon, I had X-Designer up and running
under full power less than 30 minutes from the time I started the
installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d0580.0x25c8ef8"></a>The Basic Functionality</h2></div></div><p><a href="2641f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Main
Window</b></span></a></p><p>The user interface is appealing and is designed with
programmers in mind, not the users who go &ldquo;aaaah&rdquo; at every flashy
icon that pops up. Help was there, as it should be with any Motif
application. By default, the provided XD/Help browser is launched
at help request, but there is an option to use Netscape or any
other browser for the same purpose. I prefer the provided XD/Help
utility, since Netscape offers the same functionality but eats up
system resources mercilessly compared to the small XD/Help and even
X-Designer itself. Help is all in text mode, but I believe that
after using X-Designer for some time, the need for the on-line help
slowly vanishes. There is no Motif programming information
provided, and the widgets are described only briefly. A Motif
reference book should be handy while seriously using X-Designer. I
believe the help system serves its purpose very well and is
designed with the correct assumption that advanced users do not
need a lot of colorful diagrams, examples and tips, but just a
quick reminder of what is happening.</p><p><a href="2641f2.jpg" target="_self">2641f2.gif</a></p><p>Figure 2. Help Utility</p><p>The work area of the main window provides a fair display of
the widget instance tree structure. As the widget trees can grow
large for larger applications, many options are provided to keep
much of the design within visual range. Branches can be collapsed,
and the icons for the widgets can be set to a smaller size. The
tree can be left-justified and the special annotation bitmaps can
be placed beside widgets to visually remind the user of their
special properties. The work area has a highly professional design
and provides the developer with the needed information about the
designed GUI.</p><p>The application appearance is built simultaneously as the
elements are added to the design tree. X-Designer doesn't simulate
the appearance; it actually builds the widget tree from the real
widgets. This makes it a sort of WYSIWYG GUI builder, which
introduces a dangerous possibility. If the actual widgets created
while building the application are connected or configured in a
forbidden manner, X-Designer may crash because an unexpected widget
condition will appear within the X-Designer executable. Being aware
of this problem, I tried to create all kinds of weird designs, but
X-Designer is very strict and positively sure it knows more about
Motif than I do&mdash;it would not allow me to add invalid widget
relations to my design.</p><p><a href="2641f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Typical Resource Box</b></span></a></p><p>All the standard editing options are present, including
support for printing a PostScript image of your widget trees. The
resource boxes are available, as one would expect from a GUI
builder. A separate resource panel and core resource panel are
available for each widget. The panels are aware of the Motif
defaults and let you set any resource. The Motif power is not
hidden in any way; it is just easier to use.</p><p>Callbacks can be manipulated in a similar way. The dialogs
for setting callbacks allow you to type in the name of the function
and the client data which is to be passed to the callback along
with the other parameters. X-Designer does not implement an editor
for directly editing the code, but there is an &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button in
the callback dialog. It runs your favourite editor as defined by
the EDITOR environment variable. As I am an Emacs fan, I use
<span   class="bold"><b>emacsclient</b></span> as my editor, which
connects to the running Emacs server for file editing. At first I
was annoyed to find the extra xterm popping up to run emacsclient.
However, the User's Guide is very informative, and with its help I
quickly found the location of the shell script which X-Designer
uses to run the editor. I added the emacsclient, and no more
annoying xterm. The configurability of X-Designer is worth all the
money you pay for it.</p><p>Editing the callbacks actually means editing the stubs file,
which is generated during the code-generation process. X-Designer
puts a short comment before each callback, which must be left
intact if you want to keep your callback code after generating
successive stubs files. You can even add some code into the stubs
file which has nothing to do with the callbacks, and it will be
left there after regeneration of the source files. Just follow the
well-documented method by which X-Designer treats those
comments.</p><p>Besides the usual callbacks, links can be created as well.
They are special simple callbacks which can be attached to buttons
in order to trigger simple actions like enable/disable,
manage/unmanage or show/hide certain widgets. Basically, links are
just callbacks which are saved with your design into an .xd file
and actually work in the prototype GUI built dynamically by
X-Designer. Note that the regular callback code is not saved
anywhere other than in the stubs file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d0580.0x25c9580"></a>Basic Code Generation</h2></div></div><p>Code generation is the core operation of every GUI builder.
Though X-Designer's friendly interface leads you through the GUI
design, code generation is the reason you bought it. I think the
Motif/C combination for Unix/X workstations is the native
configuration. I tried to create a few small GUIs; they all worked
and compiled without warnings. All I had to do was manually set the
location of the Motif libraries and headers in the Makefile, since
I keep them in the /client/lesstif directory. The same applies for
the C++/Motif combination, which also worked flawlessly.</p><p>Portability is an important issue today, so I set out to
explore the Java and Microsoft Windows code generation options. I
had a design targeted for a Motif/C combination, and I tried to
change it to Java code. Of course, the callback code was useless; I
didn't expect X-Designer to translate my C code into Java code, but
links also work in Java. The prerequisite for Java designs is to
include the path to a set of Java classes, which are provided with
X-Designer, in the <b  >CLASSPATH</b> variable. The
classes are put into the package called uk.co.ist.mwt. They provide
components which have counterparts in Motif but are missing in
Java. There are also some widgets which are added to the standard
Motif set to implement some Java components not present in Motif.
They are container widgets, such as the Card Widget, Flow Widget,
Border Widget, Grid Widget and GridBag Widget. This enables the
WYSIWYG development of Java applications.</p><p>Changing my test design for Java required toggling the Java
compliance toggle-button under the Module menu. X-Designer then
checks the current design, giving you messages about any
non-compliant parts. Sometimes the &ldquo;Fix&rdquo; button will be enabled,
allowing you to trigger the automatic fix for Java Compliance;
otherwise, you have to do it yourself. If you know about Java and
Motif, the messages generated by X-Designer are more than enough to
give you a clue about what is happening. I don't know much about
Java, but I know enough to make the design Java compliant within
minutes. The Java code generation dialog is different than the
C/Motif one in that you must specify which file to create. A file
for every class, the top-most application class file and separate
sources for string, color, font and other objects are included.
Using JDK 1.0.2, I compiled and ran the application without any
problems as a Java application. I could have built a Java applet,
in which case additional constraints might have popped up.</p><p>All of X-Designer's dialogs use the same convention of
marking the resources and settings which are relevant for Java.
Whenever there is a steaming coffee cup icon next to the resource,
it means that it will be honoured in Java code. A very good
feature, since at the time you make a change you can note
immediately whether or not the change code remains Java
compliant.</p><p>Using X-Designer for building Microsoft Windows applications
is another prime feature. X-Designer must be started in Windows
mode to enable this cross-platform development. It can be done via
resource, or via running it by typing
<b  >xdesigner&lt;\!s&gt;-windows</b>. In this case, an
additional button is added to the tool bar, to toggle the Windows
compliance. The procedure is similar to the one used for Java. If
you read an already created Motif design into Windows-aware
X-Designer, it prompts you with a dialog containing all the
warnings and reasons for Windows non-compliant design. Sometimes it
can fix the problems, other times it cannot.</p><p>Code for Windows is always generated as C++, in three
flavours: Motif, MFC or Motif XP. Motif XP is a set of provided
classes similar to Motif, but named to match the Microsoft
Foundation Classes. Since Motif is much more flexible and allows
more freedom than MFC, the basic task X-Designer must perform is to
apply additional constraints on the design to force Windows
compliance. This is the only method of MFC code generation. In all
the dialogs, a convention is used for the MFC-honoured resources;
if the entry field or button is painted pink, it means that the
resource is honoured only by Motif and not by MFC.</p><p>X-Designer contains very advanced tools for C++ class
structure and hierarchy maintenance. A subset of a design can be
created as a C++ class, and access control can be applied for any
widget member. One can use methods such as callbacks and even
create custom preludes into the source code to add additional class
members. An interesting feature is definition creation, which can
be put on the widget palette as a reusable group of widgets. C++
programmers will find the abundance of features extremely useful,
as the class structure becomes the property of the design and can
be maintained in cross-platform applications.</p><p>All the code-generation options are well beyond the scope of
this review, but I am convinced that even though Motif is the
native toolkit of X-Designer, Java and MFC support are advanced,
and most importantly, they work. For any design information that
can be ported to Java or MFC, X-Designer keeps track of it and
properly implements it. Every issue is considered, including font
inconsistencies, color incompatibilities, different native pixmap
formats and problems with long filenames under Windows
platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d0580.0x25c99a0"></a>Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>X-Designer hosts many features which deserve a review of
their own but will receive only a brief description here.</p><p><a href="2641f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
AppGuru Tool</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>AppGuru</b></span> is the interface to
previously designed templates for GUIs. Initially, it contains the
default template which enables you to quickly create applications
with standard components, such as a menu-bar, a tool bar and file
selection dialogues. At first the AppGuru looks like a cute toy,
but its power lies in its configurability. Each design can be
changed into a template. Using X-Designer resources, the new
template can be incorporated into the AppGuru menu with control
over the separate components, which may or may not be added into
the new application. The freedom with resources is great, so the
X-Designer administrator in a large software company can add
pixmaps which represent components. Users can easily select ones
which are really needed. I think this is a great tool for a
software engineering environment, where several pre-designed
interfaces can be set up according to internal policy. Company
information dialogues and standard application parts can be
automatically inserted into new designs.</p><p>User-defined widgets allow the GUIs created with X-Designer
to look beyond Motif and use widgets provided by a third party or
even custom widgets. When I first saw X-Designer, I noticed the
special widget for OpenGL as supplied by the MesaGL package in the
palette of X-Designer widget icons. I was curious how it got there
since it is not a Motif widget. The basic idea behind this very
complex concept lies in the interface between X-Designer and the
widgets used in the GUI building process.</p><p>Any widgets can be chosen for incorporation into X-Designer.
You must run the provided <span   class="bold"><b>xdconfig</b></span>
utility to create the configuration files which tell X-Designer
about resources, constraints and children all new widgets can have.
Even icons can be provided in pixmap form for addition to the
X-Designer widget palette. Specifying the code generation options
for every new widget is a mandatory task. After all this is done,
rebuild X-Designer using all the configuration files and the
provided xdesigner.o object file. The new binary will contain
X-Designer with the newly added widgets.</p><p>Installation provides many configurations for common widget
sets, and I tested the Athena widget set which worked fine. I can
now build GUIs with the Athena widget set, forgetting Motif. The
only drawback to this process is the fact that new widgets are
compiled into X-Designer itself. If for some reason, the widgets
cause segmentation faults or otherwise behave badly, X-Designer may
crash. I actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>managed</em></span> to crash it by
laying out Athena widgets in an invalid hierarchy. Creating
successful widget configurations requires deep knowledge of the
widgets, C, <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> and
X-Designer.</p><p>With X-Designer, an on-line help subsystem can be created for
the new applications. All help is written in HTML files with
anchors as documented in the User's guide. You must only decide
whether your application will use XD/Help, Netscape or FrameMaker
for the help browser&mdash;just link an additional provided object file
with your application.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>XD Replay/Capture</b></span> tool
is another amazing tool that comes with X-Designer. With Capture,
you select the Motif application and capture its widget instance
tree. Only the executable of the application is needed; Capture
takes a snapshot of its widget structure which you can then drag
into X-Designer and reuse. You can then take your old Motif
applications, capture them and develop them further with
X-Designer. As I understand, the tool works by inserting a sort of
parasite shared object into the application which records the
widget tree creation. The application must be dynamically linked
with Xt for Capture to work. A similar tool is XD Record/Replay; it
records any events within the application in an internal script
language. These can later be replayed for the purpose of
demonstrations, tutorials, testing and other cases where automatic
behaviour of an application is desirable.</p><p><a href="2641f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Record your application behaviour!</b></span></a></p><p>Among simpler design tools are the
<span   class="bold"><b>XmString</b></span> editor, pixmap editor,
font and color selection tools and layout editor. With the XmString
editor, arbitrary XmStrings can be generated on a WYSIWYG basis, a
fact any Motif programmer will appreciate. The layout editor is a
cool tool to define the layout of child widgets within the
container widget. As this is a tedious business, the layout editor
provides great help with setting up those widgets in a functional
and resize-friendly way. Using the pixmap editor, which is
functional and serves its purpose well, caused an interesting
event. The first time I selected the Pixmap editor entry in the
menu bar, X-Designer crashed. Strange behaviour, I thought, but
quickly decided to use this crash for testing the IST user support.
I sent e-mail to support@ist.co.uk describing my problem, and
within less than 30 minutes I got a correct answer to the faulty
behaviour. The Pixmap editor clashed with the default .fvwmrc
setting for a cryptic Meta 3rd-Mouse-button combination which is
locked for FVWM private use. I don't use it, so I removed the line
from .fvwmrc, and now the pixmap editor works fine. Well done, IST
support team. I can understand a glitch or two in any product, and
that's why good user support is necessary.</p><p><a href="2641f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Laying Out Widgets</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d0580.0x29c2488"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>X-Designer is a mature tool, and its authors have learned all
the tricks of the GUI-builder business. It won two Advanced System
Magazine Best Product of the Year awards (1993 and 1995) and was
the X Advisor Best Product in 1995. Its features make it the most
advanced GUI building tool available, to my knowledge. The basic
functionality is accessible via a very straightforward and
efficient user interface, which never bothers you with unnecessary
dialogues, questions and myriad different windows.</p><p>X-Designer is highly configurable on multiple levels, so it
can be suited to an individual company's internal demand and
further tailored to the needs of each user or department
subdivision. You can even change the default widget icons into more
colorful ones or disable the use of certain Motif widgets, if you
wish.</p><p>X-Designer is a tool for tough GUI professionals who cannot
let the GUI builder dictate their shipping deadlines. For home
users, it is a tool from another world, which makes me sigh sadly
at the thought of the approaching date when my reviewer's license
expires.</p></div></div>
