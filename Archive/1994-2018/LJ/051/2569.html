    This article explains how Linux is used in the ViewSurf
    &ldquo;Beach Report&rdquo;, a fun WebCAM-based service.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2654580.0x274c3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The raison d'&ecirc;tre of ViewSurf is to
give surfers access to up-to-date on-line weather reports. Classic
weather report information is provided, such as temperature and
wave status, but the bonus is an up-to-date video that gives the
surfer a current picture of what is happening at his favourite
beach.
</p><p>I met the creator of ViewSurf (Nicolas Saubade) during the
summer of 1996. Nicolas works for COM1 in Cestas near Bordeaux,
France. COM1 is a very famous company in France because it's the
foremost modem manufacturer in Europe even though most COM1 modems
are not distributed under its own label. Additionally, COM1
develops and distributes the ViewCOM, a high performance video
compressing system used in many security applications (see Figure
1).</p><p><a href="2569f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
ViewCOM VM3</b></span></a></p><p>The ViewCOM uses a standard video input, such as a video
camera or any PAL/SECAM/NTSC source, and converts this source to a
proprietary format based on the JPEG compression algorithm. This
format is called VCR, and the conversion can be achieved in
real-time. The ViewCOM includes a V34 PC-Card modem, so it is
typically installed on a foreign site and called by specialized
software running under Microsoft Windows (ViewCOM Manager) via a
simple phone line.</p><p>ViewCOM firmware includes a recording function to create a
compressed video sequence and send it to the caller via modem. The
size of each sequence is 100KB to 400KB and running time is 1 or 2
minutes of video.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2654580.0x274c710"></a>Using Linux</h2></div></div><p><a href="2569f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
ViewSurf basic configuration</b></span></a></p><p>The basic configuration of the ViewSurf service is quite
simple (see Figure 2). Each site has a video camera connected to a
ViewCOM. The ViewCOM is directly accessible via modem. The caller
records a short film segment and uploads it to a web server. For
the Beach Report, this operation occurs about three times a day.
The browser on the client side must download a plug-in from the
COM1 web site in order to display VCR sequences. This plug-in
originally existed only for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, so I
wrote a UNIX/Linux version which is now on the COM1 site (available
for Linux ELF, Solaris and SunOS).</p><p>Nicolas wanted to install several sites, but it was quite
difficult to manage because the ViewCOM Manager, a nice graphical
program, is not really programmable&mdash;the problem with most Windows
applications. He had to manually call four sites, three times a
day, seven days a week&mdash;not an acceptable situation.</p><p>I proposed to him that Linux be used to automate the process.
I wrote some simple shell scripts to call each site, create and
download the film and copy it to the main web server (an SGI Indy)
using the <span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> command. Most of
these scripts are based on the
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> program. The download portion
was written in C to keep up with the high speed on the serial line
(57,600 or 115,200Kbps).</p><p>I know rcp is not the best solution; Linux is a very good web
server system in its own right, but the SGI was already in place.
Film is integrated in ViewSurf pages with HTML code such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;EMBED SRC="http://your_linux_server/films/film.vcr"
WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=40&gt;
</pre><p>Actually, using rcp requires no HTML modification in the
existing pages, which is an advantage, so we opted to stay with it.
</p><p>The main shell scripts, including dial up to a group of
sites, are simply activated by a crontab entry. Additionally, these
scripts give some statistics about ViewCOM access in order to
detect any problems.</p><p>This project was not an official COM1 project, so the
software was installed on a very old DX2/66 running Slackware 3.0.
We had to buy a new 16550A-based ISA card for the serial
line.</p><p>The ViewCOM Manager was no longer needed for ViewSurf.
Nicolas was surprised by the power of Linux&mdash;all I had to do to
solve a problem was write some shell scripts using standard Linux
commands, which would have been very difficult and costly to
implement in Windows. Some months later, Nicolas created a Snow
Report, which is a service for skiing information comparable to the
Beach Report. Last winter, 3 ViewCOMs were installed in the French
Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es mountains.</p><p>Nicolas has written some additional HTML pages in order to
make the service more attractive, and ViewSurf now includes
interesting links to fun sites and tourist WebCAMs all around the
world. A specific domain now exists for ViewSurf (viewsurf.com),
and the service is available (in French) at
http://www.viewsurf.com/. Figure 3 is an example of a ViewSurf
page. Don't forget to download the VCR plug-in.</p><p><a href="2569f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Hossegor Beach (France)</b></span></a></p><p>Actually, the Linux PC is very efficient and robust. The last
time I had to reboot it was to install a new kernel version.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2654580.0x274ce48"></a>The Future of ViewSurf</h2></div></div><p>Beach Report and Snow Report are free services for the end
user, but Nicolas created ViewSurf in the hope of making some money
with it. He's currently trying to sell the service to French
Tourism Offices, but it's quite hard; basically, France is lagging
in communications and Internet services. Additionally, many French
people consider computers and the Internet as American Trojan
horses such as McDonald's or Disneyland Paris.</p><p>Most French on-line services are available for a low
performance Videotex-compatible terminal called Minitel, which was
distributed free of charge by France Telecom at the beginning of
the 1980s. This technology is obsolete, but France Telecom is
currently the only French operator for communications. The Minitel
allows them to charge up to several dollars per minute for some
on-line services. This could be the reason why most French people
don't have a PC at home, and as a result, Internet-based services
are not seriously considered.</p><p>Nicolas has gotten a contract with the government
organization which deals with traffic regulation in Paris. Some
French highways have been on the Net since September 1997. If you
compare it with other WebCAM systems, ViewSurf gives very good
quality for a small data size.</p><p>This software would be more easily configurable without
editing crontab or shell scripts each time you wished to change the
call time or add a new site. To that end, I wrote a set of CGI
(Common Gateway Interface) scripts which present a simple and
portable interface for the Linux server configuration. The
advantage of using CGI instead of standard Linux programs is the
capability to configure the server from any forms-capable browser
running on any operating system.</p><p>Another crucial option is to have the ability for several
users to look at a &ldquo;live&rdquo; video (not recorded files) at the same
time. For this, the Linux PC could be used as a server to
distribute the live image from ViewCOM to several users connected
from the Net. To reach this goal, I wrote a multi-threaded Linux
daemon, based on the POSIX 1003.1c LinuxThreads library by Xavier
Leroy (http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads). Actually,
this daemon handles only the &ldquo;video/x-vcr&rdquo; MIME type and uses two
specific TCP ports. The live video can be inserted in an HTML page
with a line such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;EMBED SRC="http://your_linux_server:daemon_port"
WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240&gt;
</pre><p>The second port is reserved for ViewCOM administration, such
as setting brightness or contrast. Additionally, the daemon can
control a weather station in order to get real-time information
about external temperature, wind speed and other weather
information. A VISCA (a standard for video camera remote control)
functionality is about to be added to control zoom, pan-and-tilt
and other camera parameters directly from the Internet browser.

private COM1 web server.
</p><p><a href="2569f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Snapshot of Bordeaux/Bayonne Motorway</b></span></a></p><p>The ViewCOM is often connected to the PC via a serial line,
but one of the most important advantages of the system could be the
ability to control a remote ViewCOM. So, it's not necessary to
install a PC on the site you want to look at, you just have to set
up a ViewCOM connected to a simple phone line or a leased line. In
the phone line case, it's possible for the daemon to call the
ViewCOM at starting time or only when an HTTP request occurs. In
this last case, the daemon hangs up the line when the last client
is disconnected.</p><p><a href="2569s1.html" target="_self">References and
