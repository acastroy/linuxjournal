    This article introduces a prototypical avalanche-predicting
    software package implemented with a Fuzzy Logic algorithm.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x248d8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Javalanche is prototypical in the sense
that the current model is too sparse and naive for practical
avalanche prediction. Nevertheless, it suggests that Fuzzy Logic
may be an appropriate tool for such an application, upon
significant enhancement of the model presented here. The software
was developed using Java in a Debian/GNU Linux environment. Graphs
were created using <span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x248da28"></a>Variables for Avalanche Prediction</h2></div></div><p>Evaluating avalanche hazard relies on gathering meaningful
data from a large number of variables including slope aspect and
angle, wind load and direction, terrain roughness, snow crystal
forms present in the snowpack, snowpack layer resistances, the
layering effect of strong over weak zones, current temperature and
temperature history, and recent snowfall depth and water content.
It is noteworthy that both long-term and current variables belong
in any usable model, that some factors are interrelated and that a
factor may or may not play a predominant role at some particular
time.</p><p>To be practical, the values of the input variables should be
relatively straightforward to measure in environments ranging from
tamed ski areas to untamed wilderness. Many of the typical
assessment tools are qualitative but have proved their worth. Snow
layers can be assessed by digging a snow pit and examining the pit
walls for snow crystal forms, temperatures and layer resistances. A
common method for assessing snow layer resistance is a hand test
which measures the level of resistance the snow layer presents to
penetration. These levels are categorized as fist, four finger, one
finger, pencil and knife in order of increasing resistance. This
aids in determining the existence of a buried instability. A
technique for assessing the amount of surface snow that can be
transported by wind is the foot penetration test. The tester steps
on the snow with one foot and measures the penetration, with 30cm
being considered enough to suggest a potential hazard. A refinement
would attempt to factor in the weight and foot area of the tester.
There are other such tests. Slope aspect is the compass direction
the slope faces. Its hazard effect will be influenced by wind
direction and exposure to the sun. The latter influence varies with
the time of year. A good web site related to these issues with
links to other sites is the Cyberspace Snow and Avalanche Center at
http://www.csac.org/.</p><p>The bottom line is that a reasonably useful model will employ
many variables, need extensive testing and refinement and require
significant input from experienced avalanche personnel. It is
clearly easier to apply the model in a developed ski area rather
than in the back country. The computer models of which we are aware
are mechanistic in nature, e.g., there is European work using
finite element analysis. We feel that Fuzzy Logic is an appropriate
tool and advance this article to explain the approach. We stress at
the outset that this paper is expository and the model presented is
not yet usable in a practical setting. However, we would approach a
mature model by including new variables one at a time and testing
the resulting software. Further, we have not even chosen the most
important variables, but rather a handful that are easily
understood.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x248dbe0"></a>Essential Elements of Fuzzy Logic</h2></div></div><p>Articles and books describing Fuzzy Logic are widely
available, as a cursory web search will quickly confirm. We
recommend Earl Cox's book as a first, practical exposure
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Fuzzy Systems Handbook</em></span>, AP Professional,
1994). First devised by Lotfi Zadeh (&ldquo;Fuzzy Sets&rdquo;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Information and Control</em></span>, Volume 8, 338-353,
1965), Fuzzy Logic is best known for its applications in industrial
control. However, it is also quite successfully used in
decision-making applications, which is the basis of our
project.</p><p>Fuzzy Logic is particularly appropriate in situations where a
mathematical model is either unavailable or too unwieldy and where
human expertise gleaned from experience and supported by intuition
is available. In particular, it emulates the human reasoning
process and employs linguistic forms in its modeling process. For
this article the first author is the Fuzzy Logic programmer, and
the second author provides the avalanche expertise.</p><p>In this article, we will introduce Fuzzy Logic via our
problem space. This approach will give you insight into the
concepts via a somewhat detailed example application. However, the
scope of this article does not allow us to present Fuzzy Logic
formally, nor in its full richness.</p><p>The minimal ingredients of a Fuzzy Logic model include these
elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>One or more input variables</p></li><li><p>A family of fuzzy sets for each input
variable</p></li><li><p>One or more output variables</p></li><li><p>A family of fuzzy sets for each output
variable</p></li><li><p>A group of rules connecting input and output
variables</p></li></ul></div><p>There are also algorithms which are applied to the model:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Fuzzification of crisp input variables</p></li><li><p>Application of the rules</p></li><li><p>Defuzzification of rule results to achieve crisp
outputs</p></li></ul></div>

The terminology embedded in the preceding two lists will become
familiar as we work through the Avalanche Predictor example.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x248e528"></a>The Fuzzy Sets for the Javalanche Model</h2></div></div><p>The model is to be applied when there has been snowfall
during the last 24-hour period. There are three input
variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Slope_Pitch, the average slope angle (degrees) in
the region of the suspected avalanche danger</p></li><li><p>Water_Equiv, the snowfall's water content
(centimeters of equivalent water)</p></li><li><p>Current_Temp, the current temperature
(Celsius)</p></li></ul></div><p>To introduce fuzzy sets, we'll start with the input variable,
Slope_Pitch. Wild slopes do not, of course, have constant pitch and
even a measurement of average pitch is approximate. Nor is it clear
that the distinction between a number like 15.2 degrees and 17.3
degrees is all that useful. Fuzzy sets provide a way to incorporate
that inherent fuzziness into a model. We somewhat arbitrarily
classify the Slope_Pitch variable into four categories, based
loosely on the corresponding skiing ability needed to competently
negotiate the terrain. These categories are Novice, Intermediate,
Advanced and Expert.
</p><p><a href="2710f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Fuzzy
Set for Novice Slope_Pitch</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2710f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. The
Four Fuzzy Sets for Slope_Pitch</b></span></a></p><p>There is no widely accepted ski industry standard for these
terms, but there is an approximate agreement on what they imply.
For example, most skiers would consider the pitch range of 0 to 10
degrees as Novice, but there would be less agreement on the angle
at which the slope would be considered no longer Novice, but
Intermediate. Fuzzy Logic would accommodate this uncertainty by
defining a fuzzy set for novice slope pitch as shown in Figure 1,
where the vertical axis is called the degree of membership (dom).
In Figure 2, the fuzzy sets for Intermediate, Advanced and Expert
are incorporated as well. Looking at Figure 2, an input Slope_Pitch
of 17.5 degrees would have a degree of membership of 0.25 in the
Novice category and of 0.75 in the Intermediate category,
reflecting the fuzzy transition from Novice to Intermediate
Slope_Pitch. Ascertaining the doms of the various input values is
called the fuzzification process.</p><p><a href="2710f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. The
Three Fuzzy Sets for Water_Equiv</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2710f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. The
Three Fuzzy Sets for Current_Temp</b></span></a></p><p>Figures 3 and 4 show fuzzy set choices for the other two
input variables, Water_Equiv and Current_Temp. The choices of fuzzy
set ranges and shapes are somewhat arbitrary, but should be guided
by the knowledge of the expert. From Figures 2, 3, and 4 we see
that the model has the following sets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Four fuzzy sets for Slope_Pitch</p></li><li><p>Three fuzzy sets for Water_Equiv</p></li><li><p>Three fuzzy sets for Current_Temp</p></li></ul></div><p>There is only one output variable, Avalanche_Danger. It is
scaled from 0 to 100. It is tempting to interpret this as the
probability of avalanche, but at this current stage of development
it is an arbitrary scale. If the model were significantly enhanced
and then used both extensively and successfully, this parameter
could be calibrated and perhaps be rather like a probability.
Figure 5 depicts the four fuzzy set categories for
Avalanche_Danger.
</p><p><a href="2710f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. The
Four Fuzzy Sets for Avalanche_Danger</b></span></a></p><p>Note that the expert snow scientist must be consulted by the
programmer to construct the fuzzy sets. It can be expected that
these would be modified and additional inputs incorporated as
experience with the model is gained.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x2485a70"></a>The Rules for the Javalanche Model</h2></div></div><p>Rules come in both conditional and unconditional varieties.
For Javalanche, only conditional rules are currently implemented. A
typical rule might be &ldquo;If Water_Equiv is Small AND Slope_Pitch is
Novice AND Current_Temp is Below_Freezing, then Avalanche_Danger is
Low.&rdquo; The <span   class="bold"><b>if</b></span> clause (antecedent)
of the rule contains input fuzzy sets, while the
<span   class="bold"><b>then</b></span> clause (consequent) contains
output fuzzy sets. Each of the rules here links three fuzzy sets in
the antecedent with the &ldquo;AND&rdquo; conjunction. Each consequent
involves a single output fuzzy set.</p><p><a href="2710f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6. Rules
for Current_Temp = Below_Freezing</b></span></a></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2710f7.jpg"></div>
 <span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7. Rules for Current_Temp =
Near_Freezing</b></span></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2710f8.jpg"></div>
 <span   class="bold"><b>Figure 8. Rules for Current_Temp =
Above_Freezing</b></span></p><p>Recall that the multiplicity of fuzzy sets for the three
input variables is 4, 3 and 3, so that the total number of rules is
the product, 36. Rather than quote each of the 36 rules, we
represent them with the three tables shown in Figures 6, 7 and 8.
Extracting a rule from a table is straightforward. The table
entries show Avalanche_Danger for two inputs, Water_Equiv (row) and
Slope_Pitch (column) while the third input is contained in the
figure label. For example, in Figure 6, the upper left corner entry
is &ldquo;Low&rdquo; and the corresponding inputs are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Water_Equiv = Small (row)</p></li><li><p>Slope_Pitch = Novice (column)</p></li><li><p>Current_Temp = Below_Freezing (Figure 6's
label)</p></li></ul></div><p>Hence the related rule is, &ldquo;If Water_Equiv is Small AND
Slope_Pitch is Novice AND Current_Temp is Below_Freezing, then
Avalanche_Danger is Low&rdquo;; the same rule quoted earlier.</p><p>Just as for the fuzzy sets, the expert snow scientist must be
consulted by the programmer in order to compose adequate rules. As
with the fuzzy sets, experience with applying the model in the real
world will most likely result in adjustments to the rules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x2486410"></a>A Sample Calculation</h2></div></div><p>To see how a Fuzzy Logic algorithm works, we'll make an
example calculation. Of course, such calculations are done by the
program, but hand calculations are essential for understanding and
for debugging the program. The steps we'll go through are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Start with three crisp input values.</p></li><li><p>Fuzzify those three values.</p></li><li><p>Evaluate the appropriate rules from the 36
available, obtaining fuzzy outputs.</p></li><li><p>Defuzzify the outputs to obtain a crisp
output.</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's say we have measured/estimated the three input
variables to be Slope_Pitch = 17 degrees, Water_Equiv = 5
centimeters, and Current_Temp = 3 Celsius. These are the crisp
values.
</p><p>To fuzzify an input variable means finding its doms in all
its fuzzy sets. Using Figure 2, we find that Slope_Pitch has these
doms in its fuzzy sets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Novice dom = 0.3</p></li><li><p>Intermediate dom = 0.7</p></li><li><p>Advanced dom = 0.0</p></li><li><p>Expert dom = 0.0</p></li></ul></div><p>Similarly, from Figure 3, the Water_Equiv values are
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Small dom = 0.0</p></li><li><p>Medium dom = 1.0</p></li><li><p>Big dom = 0.0</p></li></ul></div>

Last, from Figure 4, the Current_Temp values are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Below_Freezing dom = 0.0</p></li><li><p>Near_Freezing dom = 0.5</p></li><li><p>Above_Freezing dom = 0.5</p></li></ul></div>

This completes the fuzzification process.
</p><p>After fuzzification, the rules are evaluated. Not all the
rules will apply in each instance. In particular, if any of the
three inputs has a dom = 0.0, then that rule does not apply. From
the preceding dom calculation we see that two fuzzy sets for
Slope_Pitch, one fuzzy set for Water_Equiv, and two fuzzy sets for
Current_Temp have nonzero dom values. Consequently, four ( = 2x1x2)
rules apply; namely, the first two in the middle row of Figure 7
and the first two in the middle row of Figure 8.</p><p>We'll continue our sample calculation by evaluating only one
of the four rules. Let's consider the rule that has a consequence
of Moderate Avalanche_Danger, from Figure 7: &ldquo;If Water_Equiv is
Medium AND Slope_Pitch is Intermediate AND Current_Temp is
Near_Freezing, then Avalanche_Danger is Moderate.&rdquo;</p><p>To evaluate this rule, we combine the doms of the antecedent
fuzzy sets by forming their product:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Slope_Pitch has Intermediate dom = 0.7</p></li><li><p>Water_Equiv has Medium dom = 1.0</p></li><li><p>Current_Temp has Near_Freezing dom = 0.5</p></li></ul></div><p>The product = 0.35 is then assigned to the output, i.e., the
Avalanche_Danger value has a dom of 0.35 in the Moderate fuzzy
output set. Using the product of the doms to combine the fuzzy sets
joined by the AND conjunction is called the &ldquo;product AND&rdquo;. Fuzzy
Logic allows other choices (see Cox's book).
</p><p>The other three rules which apply in our case must also be
evaluated. We won't do those calculations here&mdash;they are quite
similar to the evaluation of the first. Note that of the four rules
that apply, two have a consequence of Moderate and two have a
consequence of Low. We choose to combine the dom values for the Low
fuzzy set by adding them together, thus allowing each rule that
fires to have an effect. We do the same thing for the Moderate
doms. This is often done in decision-making problems, but is not
the only option possible (again, see Cox's book). Hence, we now
have these dom values for Avalanche_Danger:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Low = 0.3</p></li><li><p>Moderate = 0.7</p></li><li><p>High = 0.0</p></li><li><p>Spontaneous = 0.0</p></li></ul></div><p>These dom values are then &ldquo;defuzzified&rdquo;, as in Figure 5.
After looking at the figure with these dom values, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the resultant number will be between
10.0 and 20.0, and because the Moderate dom is stronger, it ought
to be closer to 20.0 than to 10.0. In practice, we use a weighted
average known as the &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo;, and it yields 19.0 for
this case. We won't do the detailed calculation here.
</p><p>Thus, for our sample calculation, the input values of
Slope_Pitch = 17 degrees, Water_Equiv = 5 centimeters, and
Current_Temp = 3 have led to an output value of Avalanche_Danger =
19.0, a value mostly in the Moderate region, but with some
membership in the Low region.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x2a16848"></a>An Overview of the Software</h2></div></div><p>The software is available via anonymous FTP from
ftp://turing.sirti.org/pub/ras/fuz3.tar.gz. When unzipped and
unarchived, it will produce a directory tree with fuz3 as the top
node. The top node contains a README file, enabling a user to both
use and modify the package. To execute the software, it is assumed
that the user's machine has Java properly installed. We used
JDK1.1.1.</p><p>In the lowest subdirectory, io_n_sets, three files contain
the fundamental classes chosen for the model, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ioput.java contains a class for input and output
variables.</p></li><li><p>fz_set.java contains a class for the fuzzy
sets.</p></li><li><p>cond_rule contains a class for the conditional
rules.</p></li></ul></div><p>These classes contain no information specific to the
avalanche prediction model.
</p><p>The parent directory of io_n_sets is init_n_run which
contains two source files of interest: make_init_file.java and
run_eng.java. The first of these creates an initialization file,
fz_init.dat, which is read by run_eng.java to initialize its Fuzzy
Logic &ldquo;engine&rdquo;. Only make_init_file.java contains the model for
the avalanche predictor. Hence, it may be modified to apply the
software to other decision-making problems. As expected, after
initializing itself, run_eng.java requests the input variable
selection from the user, then runs the Fuzzy Logic engine and
produces an output result.</p><p>The software can be executed from a terminal window in the X
Window System environment by entering the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
appletviewer run_eng.html
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2395580.0x2a16d70"></a>Possible Future Work</h2></div></div><p>Here we discuss two topics as possible improvements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Refining and extending the Javalanche
application</p></li><li><p>Replacing make_init_file.java with a user language
and translator</p></li></ul></div><p>To refine and extend the Javalanche application would require
field testing and model refinement/enhancement by an active
avalanche control group. The earlier portion of this paper
identified various other important input parameters which we will
investigate. Even if this does not prove feasible, we believe we
have made a case for the use of Fuzzy Logic in avalanche
prediction.
</p><p>The approach using make_init_file.java serves to
isolate/modularize the specific application, but is not
user-friendly. A preferable approach is to allow a user to employ a
simple editor to create a text file containing the
application-specific details. This is to be written in a language
designed specifically for this purpose (a user-specific language).
This is then run through the translator whose output is an
initialization file, functionally similar to fz_init.dat. The
translator can provide a very important feature not provided by
make_init_file.dat. In particular, the translator will check the
text file written by the user for any errors which are not
intrinsically run-time errors. This could then be used by an
avalanche control group whose personnel need not be programmers and
must merely learn a descriptive text modeling system based on terms
familiar to them.</p><p>The translator could also produce a second set of files
appropriate for producing graphical views (e.g., using gnuplot) of
the fuzzy sets for the user. The designing, implementation, and
testing of the translator will most likely be assigned as a
homework project for students in the compiler design course at
Eastern Washington University. This task could be accomplished in a
straightforward manner using <span   class="bold"><b>flex</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>bison</b></span>, compiler construction
tools available within Linux. There are also Java versions of these
tools for Linux which may be mature by now.</p></div></div>
