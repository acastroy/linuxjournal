</p><p>COMDEX in Chicago (April 20-23) was a titanic Linux hit.
Vendors around us were astonished by the attention and business we
drew to our booths.</p><p>The Linux Pavilion had a huge sign overhead (thanks to Carlie
Fairchild of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and Andy Wahtera,
our new ZD/COMDEX representative), and multiple large floor signs
guided people entering COMDEX to the Linux International Pavilion.
We had a page on the COMDEX web site, mention in the Show Daily and
other marketing &ldquo;aids&rdquo;.</p><p>Linux International vendors with booths in the Pavilion were
Caldera, S.u.S.E., InfoMagic Inc., <i  >Linux Journal</i> and Red Hat Software, Inc., a small number of
vendors, but big in heart.</p><p>While smaller in attendance than its Las Vegas cousin, COMDEX
in Chicago seemed to have a lot more end-user customers than the
Las Vegas show&mdash;not really surprising when you consider Chicago is
a cultural, economic and manufacturing center. While Mr. Bill was
still trying to boot Windows 98 and have it stay up, the Linux
International Pavilion was singing a sweet song. Some people
thought we had set a new world's record for &ldquo;longest line at
COMDEX&rdquo;--the line where people waited to pick up a free Linux
CD-ROM.</p><p>I accompanied Red Hat's &ldquo;booth gang&rdquo;, Anna, Terry and Mike,
to visit the Argonne National Laboratory and Western Suburban
Chicago Linux Users Group (which thankfully is abbreviated AALUG
and has its web site at
http://hydra.pns.anl.gov/lug/lug-main.html). The meeting was
actually held at the Fermi National Lab, which recently announced
that Linux will be officially supported at their laboratory and
with their applications. Donnie Barnes flew in from Durham, North
Carolina to give a talk on Red Hat 5.0, and to help give out Red
Hat &ldquo;souvenirs&rdquo;. I gave a brief talk at the end of Donnie's epic
speech.</p><p>After the meeting ended, Dr. G. P. Yeh, a physicist in the
computing division, invited us on a tour to see a particle-collider
detector. Fermi is expanding their collider, and the new one is
expected to produce more than 20 times the data of its predecessor.
To expand the computing power to analyze and store this data in
real time with traditional methods would have been very costly, so
now Fermi is building a 1000-node Beowulf system to detect quarks
(and other little things). Dr. Yeh told us that without Linux and
the concept of Beowulf systems, the costs of supplying computer
power for the next generation of collider would be many times what
they are now forecasting.</p><p>Our sincere thanks to Dan Yocum for setting up the meeting at
Fermi and advertising it, and to Dr. Yeh for showing us the
collider.</p><p>On Wednesday S.u.S.E. gave a talk at the Chicagoland Linux
Users Group, and on Thursday I gave a two-hour &ldquo;ramble&rdquo; to the
same group after COMDEX was over. Then, tired and thirsty, most
people retired to the Goose Island Brewpub.</p><p>The Chicagoland Linux Users Group (http://clug.cc.uic.edu/)
helped to staff the Linux International booth, hand out flyers and
line up user group meetings. So &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Clyde Reichie, Don
Weimann, Simon Epsteyn, William Golembo, Gennagy &ldquo;Ugean&rdquo;
Polishchuk, Long Huynh, Perry Mages, Viktorie Navratilova, Ben
Galliart, Richard Hinton, and especially to Dave Blondell, the
president, who organized the group and the schedules.</p><p>Linux International would like to encourage other Linux
vendors to join us in the next Linux Pavilion at COMDEX, whether it
be in Las Vegas or Chicago. We are definitely looking forward to
the next COMDEX in the windy city. For information on membership or
