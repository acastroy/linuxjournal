article as &ldquo;Satellite Remote Sensing of the Oceans&rdquo; by S. Keogh,
E. Oikonomou, D. Ballestero and I. Robinson. My attention was held
very closely by the details and explanations written in this
article. I'm well aware of the problems in remote sensing systems,
and the potentially enormous amounts of data which must be
manipulated in order to make sense of it. This was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>great</em></span>! Find more authors like them.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Staehle staehle@netvalue.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b2f0"></a>Kernel Korner</h2></div></div><p>First let me congratulate all of <i  >LJ</i>'s
editors. I am staying up hours to digest and learn all I can
possibly read. It is really wonderful to have a chance to learn so
much.</p><p>Here I am referring to &ldquo;Writing a Linux Driver&rdquo; by Fernando
Mat&iacute;a. I find it to be a good foundation for device drivers.
An added reference for anyone who would like to look into drivers
further is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Writing A UNIX Device Driver</em></span> by
Janet Egan and Thomas Teixeira (John Wiley and Sons, 1988). Even
though it is for UNIX, it proves very useful for Linux. Thanking
you and Fernando Mat&iacute;a.</p><p>&mdash;Silvio agola@grumpy.igpp.ucla.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b558"></a>About Issue 47 (GUI)</h2></div></div><p>I have subscribed to your wonderful magazine since 1995 and I
have found it to be useful, informative and fair. But I must tell
you my disappointment about your graphical user interfaces issue,
March 1998.a) XView is old and passing out of favor, even though it
is still useful.b) CDE is proprietary.c) TkDesk is nothing more
than an elaborate file manager.d) GTK and GNOME are by no means
ready for production machines.</p><p>You failed to mention the wonderful, useful, highly advanced
KDE project (see http://www.kde.org/), despite the fact that it is
in the beta three stage. I have installed it on production machines
in radiological clinics under both Linux (x86 architecture) and
SunOS. I wonder why you did not dedicate a few lines to a project
like KDE&mdash;in my opinion, the only runner capable of stopping the
wave of Microsoft's products. If libQT licenses are the problem, it
is inconsistent with the presence of articles on all-commercial
products like CDE and X-Designer/Motif, since libQT is free for
free Linux development. Please reconsider this position and take a
look at KDE.</p><p>Thank you very much for your consideration and keep up the
excellent <i  >LJ</i>--I love it.</p><p>&mdash;Daniel Benenstein dbenenst@cs.com.uy</p><p>There was no conscious decision on my part to snub
KDE. In fact, I had a KDE article scheduled, but it came in after
the deadline and the issue was already full. I plan to run this
article in the near future. The May issue does have a short
comparison review of both KDE and GNOME in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span> column &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b870"></a>Dealing with Cookies</h2></div></div><p>The most elegant method for dealing with cookies is simply to
symbolically link the cookie file to /dev/null, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s ~/.netscape/cookies /dev/null
</pre><p>This has the effect of accepting all cookies, so you are not
denied access to any web sites, but immediately funnels them into a
black hole. Having /dev/null &ldquo;world readable&rdquo; is infinitely
preferable to disclosing your browsing habits to webbots.

very nice) for three months. I have learned different things (as I
do from any journal), but I have also found some bugs. In the
article &ldquo;Ghostscript&rdquo; by Robert Kiesling (March 1998), there are
two points I do not agree with.</p><p>The author says that it is not possible to see .eps files
included in LaTeX files with <span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span>.
I say: wrong. I use LaTeX2e and xdvi almost every day, and I can
see the .eps files through xdvi. (I cannot zoom, but I can see what
is displayed, which is usually enough.) The .eps files I use are
generated by <span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>transfig</b></span>.</p><p>The author says that <span   class="bold"><b>gs</b></span> used
with device X11 will create a window. I have tried this, and the
X11 device is not a default one for gs 4.xx. I can see my .ps files
with gs, but I must use Ghostview as the GUI. I do not think that
the programmers have taken the X11 device away from version 3 to
version 4. Has the author made a mistake in his script
files?</p><p>I am using Red Hat 4.0 (with a lot of patches and a
Slackware-like installation) but my LaTeX2e, xdvi and
Ghost(script/view) are original and standard ones, so I should be
able to do what the author mentioned, but I cannot.</p><p>&mdash;Raphael Marvie marvierx@cs.man.ac.uk</p><p>I have to blame my use or installation of xdvi for the
inability to print \special commands. The distribution on which the
article is based has been upgraded several times now. I've received
plenty of mail from TeXperts saying they have no problem with
reproducing EPS graphics on screen.</p><p>The X11 driver is standard in every recent version of
Ghostscript, but it is not necessarily the default. It can,
however, be specified on the command line with the parameter
<b  >-sDEVICE=X11</b>. During the process of building
Ghostscript, it and all of the other supplied driver code can be
specified in the Makefile.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Kiesling kiesling@terracom.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249c000"></a>PhotoShop</h2></div></div><p>I noticed in your April edition, you used PhotoShop to create
the cover image. I understand that at SSC you use non-Linux systems
for some of your graphics and page layout. Wouldn't it be nice if
you could do it all in Linux? I think the GIMP is great, but
nothing on Linux compares with PhotoShop.</p><p>The only thing to do is to port PhotoShop (and possibly
Framemaker) to Linux. Adobe is aware of the desire for such
products, and even confronts it on the following web pages:
http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/QANDA/259e.htm and
http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/QANDA/2bf6.htm I
believe if enough people show an interest, Adobe will eventually
come around. What a great day that will be for Linux! Adobe asks
that we send all suggestions of this nature to:</p><p>Adobe Systems, Inc.PhotoShop Product Management345 Park
AvenueSan Jose, CA 95110-2704</p><p>I hope that many of you will send requests to Adobe to let
them know how you feel.</p><p>&mdash;Jason F.jasonf@usi.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249c268"></a>APO Mailing</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to ask in an open forum that computer product
resellers, and Linux folks specifically, allow for U.S. forces
overseas to have better web commerce access.</p><p>Although we can often order products, many web-based address
databases are unable to accept an APO/FPO address. There also seems
to be a small lack of understanding of how mail from the U.S. is
delivered to troops stationed overseas.</p><p>When a package is sent to an APO/FPO address, it is carried
by U.S. Postal Service mail to one of three military postal
offices. New York serves European troops, Miami serves troops in
the southern hemisphere, and San Francisco serves the Pacific
installations. There is no additional cost to the shipper&mdash;the
military picks up the tab as soon as it gets to the APO/FPO. If the
city is added to the address, it can have terminal effects on
packages, many of which never arrive or are bounced around several
places. We cannot receive mail from either FedEx or UPS.</p><p>There are web commerce servers that provide for this type of
addressing, but more need to be available. I appreciate the efforts
of the web maintainers in keeping good commerce available and ask
for this request to be considered.</p><p>&mdash;Leam Hallgers hom@spidernet.it</p><p><a href="2957s2.html" target="_self">Lost &amp; Found</a></p><p>
