    When you need to network your Linux box with Windows, Samba
    is the way to do it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a624a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The whole point of networking is to allow
computers to easily share information. Sharing information with
other Linux boxes, or any UNIX host, is easy&mdash;tools such as FTP and
NFS are readily available and frequently set up easily &ldquo;out of the
box&rdquo;. Unfortunately, even the most die-hard Linux fanatic has to
admit the operating system most of the PCs in the world are running
is one of the various types of Windows. Unless you use your Linux
box in a particularly isolated environment, you will almost
certainly need to exchange information with machines running
Windows. Assuming you're not planning on moving all of your files
using floppy disks, the tool you need is Samba.
</p><p>Samba is a suite of programs that gives your Linux box the
ability to speak SMB (Server Message Block). SMB is the protocol
used to implement file sharing and printer services between
computers running OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95 and Windows for
Workgroups. The protocol is analogous to a combination of NFS
(Network File System), <span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span> (the
standard UNIX printer server) and a distributed authentication
framework such as NIS or Kerberos. If you are familiar with
Netatalk, Samba does for Windows what Netatalk does for the
Macintosh. While running the Samba server programs, your Linux box
appears in the &ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo; as if it were just another
Windows machine. Users of Windows machines can &ldquo;log into&rdquo; your
Linux server and, depending on the rights they are granted, copy
files to and from parts of the UNIX file system, submit print jobs
and even send you WinPopup messages. If you use your Linux box in
an environment that consists almost completely of Windows NT and
Windows 95 machines, Samba is an invaluable tool.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2716f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Network Neighborhood, Showing the Samba Server
</p></div></div><p>Samba also has the ability to do things that normally require
the Windows NT Server to act as a WINS server and process &ldquo;network
logons&rdquo; from Windows 95 machines. A PAM module derived from Samba
code allows you to authenticate UNIX logins using a Windows NT
Server. A current Samba project seeks to reverse engineer the
proprietary Windows NT domain-controller protocol and re-implement
it as a component of Samba. This code, while still very
experimental, can already successfully process a logon request from
a Windows NT Workstation computer. It shouldn't be long before it
will act as a full-fledged Primary Domain Controller (PDC), storing
user account information and establishing trust relationships with
other NT domains. Best of all, Samba is freely available under the
GNU public license, just as Linux is. In many environments the
Windows NT Server is required only to provide file services,
printer spools and access control to a collection of Windows 95
machines. The combination of Linux and Samba provides a powerful
low-cost alternative to the typical Microsoft solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62870"></a>Windows Networking</h2></div></div><p>Understanding how Samba does its job is easier if you know a
little about how Windows networking works. Windows clients use file
and printer resources on a server by transmitting &ldquo;Server Message
Block&rdquo; over a NetBIOS session. NetBIOS was originally developed by
IBM to define a networking interface for software running on MS-DOS
or PC-DOS. It defines a set of networking services and the software
interface for accessing those services, but does not specify the
actual protocol used to move bits on the network.</p><p>Three major flavors of NetBIOS have emerged since it was
first implemented, each differing in the transport protocol used.
The original implementation was referred to as NetBEUI (NetBIOS
Extended User Interface), which is a low-overhead transport
protocol designed for single segment networks. NetBIOS over IPX,
the protocol used by Novell, is also popular. Samba uses NetBIOS
over TCP/IP, which has multiple advantages.</p><p>TCP/IP is already implemented on every operating system worth
its salt, so it has been relatively easy to port Samba to virtually
every flavor of UNIX, as well as OS/2, VMS, AmigaOS, Apple's
Rhapsody (which is really NextSTEP) and (amazingly) mainframe
operating systems like CMS. Samba is also used in embedded systems,
such as stand-alone printer servers and Whistle's InterJet Internet
appliance. Using TCP/IP also means that Samba fits in nicely on
large TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet. Recognizing these
advantages, Microsoft has renamed the combination of SMB and
NetBIOS over TCP/IP the Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS).
Microsoft is currently working to have CIFS accepted as an Internet
standard for file transfer.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2716f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span> is the core of Samba. It
establishes sessions, authenticates clients and provides access to
the file system and printers. <span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span>
implements the &ldquo;network browser&rdquo;. Its role is to advertise the
services that the Samba server has to offer.
<span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span> causes the Samba server to
appear in the &ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo; of Windows NT and Windows 95
machines and allows users to browse the list of available
resources. It would be possible to run a Samba server without nmbd,
but users would need to know ahead of time the NetBIOS name of the
server and the resource on it they wish to access.
<span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span> implements the Microsoft
network browser protocol, which means it participates in browser
elections (sometimes called &ldquo;browser wars&rdquo;), and can act as a
master or back-up browser. <span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span>
can also function as a WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) server,
which is necessary if your network spans more than one TCP/IP
subnet.</p><p>Samba also includes a collection of other tools.
<span   class="bold"><b>smbclient</b></span> is an SMB client with a
shell-based user interface, similar to FTP, that allows you to copy
files to and from other SMB servers, as well as allowing you to
access SMB printer resources and send WinPopup messages. For users
of Linux, there is also an SMB file system that allows you to
attach a directory shared from a Windows machine into your Linux
file system. <span   class="bold"><b>smbtar</b></span> is a shell
script that uses smbclient to store a remote Windows file share to,
or restore a Windows file share from a standard UNIX tar
file.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>testparm</b></span> command, which
parses and describes the contents of your smb.conf file, is
particularly useful since it provides an easy way to detect
configuration mistakes. Other commands are used to administer
Samba's encrypted password file, configure alternate character sets
for international use and diagnose problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a63108"></a>Configuring Samba</h2></div></div><p>As usual, the best way to explain what a program can do is to
show some examples. For two reasons, these examples assume that you
already have Samba installed. First, explaining how to build and
install Samba would be enough material for an article of its own.
Second, since Samba is available as Red Hat and Debian packages
shortly after each new stable release is announced, installation
under Linux is a snap. Further, most &ldquo;base&rdquo; installations of
popular distributions already automatically install Samba.</p><p>Before Samba version 1.9.18 it was necessary to compile Samba
yourself if you wished to use encrypted password authentication.
This was true because Samba used a DES library to implement
encryption, making it technically classified as a munition by the
U.S. government. Binary versions of Samba with encrypted password
support could not be legally exported from the United States, which
led mirror sites to avoid distributing pre-compiled copies of Samba
with encryption enabled. Starting with version 1.9.18, Samba uses a
modified DES algorithm not subject to export restrictions. Now the
only reason to build Samba yourself is if you like to test the
latest alpha releases or you wish to build Samba with non-standard
features.</p><p>Since SMB is a large and complex protocol, configuring Samba
can be daunting. Over 170 different configuration options can
appear in the smb.conf file, Samba's configuration file. In spite
of this, have no fear. Like nearly all aspects of UNIX, it is
pretty easy to get a simple configuration up and running. You can
then refine this configuration over time as you learn the function
of each parameter. Last, the latest version of Samba, when this
article was written in late January, was 1.9.18p1. It is possible
that the behavior of some of these options will have changed by the
time this is printed. As usual, the documentation included with the
Samba distribution (especially the README file) is the definitive
source of information.</p><p>The smb.conf file is stored by the Red Hat and Debian
distributions in the /etc directory. If you have built Samba
yourself and haven't modified any of the installation paths, it is
probably stored in /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf. All of the
programs in the Samba suite read this one file, which is structured
like a Windows *.INI file, for configuration information. Each
section in the file begins with a name surrounded by square
brackets and either the name of a service or one of the special
sections: <b  >[global]</b>, <b  >[homes]</b>
or <b  >[printers]</b>.</p><p>Each configuration parameter is either a global parameter,
which means it controls something that affects the entire server,
or a service parameter, which means it controls something specific
to each service. The <b  >[global]</b> section is used to
set all the global configuration options, as well as the default
service settings. The <b  >[homes]</b> section is a
special service section dynamically mapped to each user's home
directory. The <b  >[printers]</b> section provides an
easy way to share every printer defined in the system's
<b  >printcap</b> file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a635d8"></a>A Simple Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The following smb.conf file describes a simple and useful
Samba configuration that makes every user's home directory on my
Linux box available over the network.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
        netbios name = FRODO
        workgroup = UAB-TUCC
        server string = John Blair's Linux Box
        security = user
        printing = lprng
[homes]
        comment = Home Directory
        browseable = no
        read only = no
</pre><p>The settings in the <b  >[global]</b> section set
the name of the host, the workgroup of the host and the string that
appears next to the host in the browse list. The security parameter
tells Samba to use &ldquo;user level&rdquo; security. SMB has two modes of
security: share, which associates passwords with specific
resources, and user, which assigns access rights to specific users.
There isn't enough space here to describe the subtleties of the two
modes, but in nearly every case you will want to use user-level
security.
</p><p>The printing command describes the local printing system
type, which tells Samba exactly how to submit print jobs, display
the print queue, delete print jobs and other operations. If your
printing system is one that Samba doesn't already know how to use,
you can specify the commands to invoke for each print
operation.</p><p>Since no encryption mode is specified, Samba will default to
using plaintext password authentication to verify every connection
using the standard UNIX password utilities. Remember, if your Linux
distributions uses PAM, the PAM configuration must be modified to
allow Samba to authenticate against the password database. The Red
Hat package handles this automatically. Obviously, in many
situations, using plaintext authentication is foolish. Configuring
Samba to support encrypted passwords is outside the scope of this
article, but is not difficult. See the file ENCRYPTION.txt in the
/docs directory of the Samba distribution for details.</p><p>The settings in the <b  >[homes]</b> section
control the behavior of each user's home directory share. The
comment parameter sets the string that appears next to the resource
in the browse list. The <b  >browseable</b> parameter
controls whether or not a service will appear in the browse list.
Something non-intuitive about the <b  >[homes]</b>
section is that setting <b  >browseable = no</b> still
means that a user's home directory will appear as a directory with
its name set to the authenticated user's username. For example,
with <b  >browseable = no</b>, when I browse this Samba
server I will see a share called <b  >jdblair</b>. If
<b  >browseable = yes</b>, both a share called
<b  >homes</b> and <b  >jdblair</b> would
appear in the browse list. Setting <b  >read only =
no</b> means that users should be able to write to their home
directory if they are properly authenticated. They would not,
however, be able to write to their home directory if the UNIX
access rights on their home directory prevented them from doing so.
Setting <b  >read only = yes</b> would mean that the user
would not be able to write to their home directory regardless of
the actual UNIX permissions.</p><p>The following configuration section would grant access to
every printer that appears in the printcap file to any user that
can log into the Samba server. Note that the <b  >guest ok =
yes</b> normally doesn't grant access to every user when the
server is using user-level security. Every print service must
define <b  >printable = yes</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[printers]
        browseable = no
        guest ok = yes
        printable = yes
</pre><p>This last configuration snippet adds a server share called
public that grants read-only access to the anonymous ftp directory.
You will have to set up the printer driver on the client machine.
You can use the <span   class="bold"><b>printer name</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>printer driver</b></span> commands to
automate the process of setting up the printer client on Windows 95
and Windows NT clients.
<pre     class="programlisting">
[public]
        comment = Public FTP Directory
        path = /home/ftp/pub
        browseable = yes
        read only = yes
        guest ok = yes
</pre>

</p><p>Be aware that this description doesn't explain some subtle
issues, such as the difference between user and share level
security and other authentication issues. It also barely scratches
the surface of what Samba can do. On the other hand, it's a good
example of how easy it can be to create a simple but working
smb.conf file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a5aa18"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Samba is the tool of choice for bridging the gap between UNIX
and Windows systems. This article discussed using Samba on Linux in
particular, but it is also an excellent tool for providing access
to more traditional UNIX systems like Sun and RS/6000 servers.
Further, Samba exemplifies the best features of free software,
especially when compared to commercial offerings. Samba is
powerful, well supported and under continuous active improvement by
the Samba Team.</p><p><a href="2716s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
