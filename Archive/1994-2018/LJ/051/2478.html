marks the start of the fifth Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT)
experiment aboard the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) research
vessel RRS <span   class="emphasis"><em>James Clark Ross</em></span>. Each year the
ship sails from the UK to the Falkland Islands in September en
route to service the UK Antarctic research bases. Jim (our UNIX
support engineer) is busy fastening down his trusty Toshiba laptop
(Tecra 730XCDT with 48MB) in his cabin on board <span   class="emphasis"><em>James
Clark Ross</em></span> in preparation for the inevitable bad
weather. Ahead of us lie six weeks of precision ocean-atmosphere
measurements, near real-time data processing, heated debate,
troubleshooting and, hopefully, some scientific discovery.
Fortunately, we have both chosen one of the most versatile and
reliable operating systems at hand to maximize our output during
this experiment&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span>. This article discusses
the impact of Linux, which is now routinely used at BAS and during
the AMT experiments. (See http://www1.npm.ac.uk/amt/ for more

Figure 1) was launched in 1990 and is one of the world's most
complex marine research vessels, incorporating over 400 square
meters of scientific laboratory space. It was named after the
scientist and polar explorer Admiral Sir James Clark Ross, RN
(1800-1862), who in February 1842 reached 78.9 degrees S&mdash;a record
which remarkably stood well into the 20th century.</p><p>Figure 2 shows the track taken by the <span   class="emphasis"><em>James Clark

Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) carried on the SeaStar spacecraft.
Different types of phytoplankton have characteristically different
concentrations of chlorophyll and are, therefore, different in
color. By measuring the color of the ocean with the SeaWiFS
instrument, estimates of the amount and general type of
phytoplankton in specific regions can be made as shown in Figure 2.

SeaWiFS mission at

cruises are fundamental for the calibration, validation and
interpretation of remotely sensed observations, including
sea-surface temperature, wind speed, atmospheric water vapour and
ocean colour (which can be related to bio-optical processes)&mdash;all
of which are vital for ongoing climate research. Figure 3 shows the
instrument cluster mounted on the forward mast of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>James Clark Ross</em></span> which measures, among other
things, sea-surface temperature (using an infrared radiometer),
solar radiation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, radar
backscatter (a measure of surface roughness) and humidity. All of
these measurements are used to investigate the processes, occurring
at the air-sea interface, which in many cases define the signal
actually measured by the satellite instruments. (See
http://www1.npm.ac.uk/amt/ for more information on the AMT
project.)</p><p><a href="2478f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.

of an operating system is that it integrate with the existing
computing infrastructure available on (in this case) BAS ships and
also at Antarctic bases as well as at headquarters. Since the
majority of instruments are logged to Sun SPARC workstations, it
makes sense to run an OS which allows NFS mounts to the data areas
the workstations create. Many users require the ability to perform
data processing locally without having to place extra strain on the
data-logging workstations. As most of this is undertaken using
shell scripts or compiled C source code, it made sense to run a
form of UNIX locally. This enables shell scripts to run with no
modifications and the C code to easily recompile. Other user-driven
considerations included access to backup hardware, hard-copy
output, real-time data displays and access to a common library of
software packages.</p><p><a href="2478f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. The
main laboratory space occupied by the Linux workstations aboard the
RRS </b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>James Clark Ross</em></span> during the AMT
experiments.</a></p><p>Upon considering these requirements, our choice was made
simple: it had to be Red Hat Linux. For our purpose, Linux provides
an extremely versatile operating system with the ability to
effortlessly and seamlessly integrate itself efficiently into any
existing network system. The immense amount of supported hardware
made installation on Jim's laptop and on our desktop machines a
painless exercise, and we were delighted with the way that even a
default installation gave us exactly what we wanted. It is this
kind of hardware support and user-friendly installation interface
which caught our eye in the first place when considering various
UNIX systems for Intel processors.</p><p>After unpacking our brand new PC (Intel DX 120; 32MB RAM) and
removing the pre-installed OS (we did ask for Linux), the whole
installation took less than an afternoon. We now had a fully
working UNIX workstation configured within the <span   class="emphasis"><em>James
Clark Ross</em></span> NIS domain, auto-mounting file systems
whenever required. Jim went even further with his laptop. Using
Caldera Wabi 2.0, he had the ability to run the BAS standard word
processor and e-mail packages (which are MS Windows-based). Being
able to do all this using free or inexpensive software proves what
a professional product Linux is. Gone are the days when Linux was
considered a &ldquo;toy UNIX&rdquo; for hackers&mdash;it is now a fully functional
UNIX environment which is just as stable (if not more) as the
various commercial UNIX systems on the market.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x26375d8"></a>Software Support</h2></div></div><p>Software support for Linux is already immense, and growing
rapidly. Of particular importance was our need to use the RSI Inc.
Interactive Data Language (IDL) to develop processing tools and
visualize our data in near real time. IDL is a powerful
data-visualization tool, and RSI Inc. recognized the power of Linux
several years ago by choosing to support it. Using Linux IDL, a
complete data-processing suite was developed for two new
instruments deployed during the AMT which are still in active use
today. We also had a need to effectively communicate and work on
collective documents during our time at sea. Most users choose MS
Word for this purpose, and using Caldera Wabi 2.0, we were easily
able to supply this application. This, coupled with Linux's ability
to mount Novell Netware volumes, meant that we truly had the best
of both worlds: access to all our UNIX file systems plus the
Netware volumes and associated applications. In fact, we found
certain applications ran significantly more reliably under Wabi
than they did under their native operating system.</p><p>For example, the Wabi interface allowed us to manipulate
(independent of the ship's logging system) a Campbell Scientific
Data Logger located on the forward mast via short-haul modem
communications connected to the Linux desktop. Using Campbell's own
data logger software under Windows 95, we found that significant
drifts in the system date-time stamp of 10min/day were confusing
the data logger, which is auto-adjusted to keep the data logger
time in sync with the PC time. The only solution was a system
restart every 6 hours or so in order for Windows 95 to grab a
correct time on startup. We found that under Linux Wabi, these
problems no longer existed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2637738"></a>Linux in Other Areas</h2></div></div><p>The British Antarctic Survey has written custom software to
allow its ships and bases to send and receive electronic mail with
the rest of the world using standard Internet e-mail addresses. It
was decided to write custom software so that mail could be
compressed more efficiently than when using standard protocols, and
this in turn reduces costs as it decreases the amount of expensive
satellite air time required.</p><p>When considering all the requirements, it became clear that a
system based around Sendmail running on a UNIX workstation was an
almost ideal solution. This solution could be easily implemented on
our ships and bases which already had Sun SPARC workstations. As
for two smaller bases, it was decided to send PCs running Debian
Linux. Again, Linux proved to be an inexpensive but professional
solution to a problem. It would have been difficult to justify the
expense of Sun SPARCs for the smaller bases, whereas it was
relatively inexpensive to install Linux on a couple of older PCs
which still performed well. The fact that BAS chose to use Linux to
perform Antarctic communications with two of its bases shows its
trust in the stability of Linux, as the communications systems are
vital to the normal operation of bases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2637898"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Without Linux, the computing options for these types of
operations are simple: either pay large amounts of money for
proprietary systems, or suffer at the hands of a less versatile
operating system. Linux changes all that. We are able to function
at a professional level at a minimum cost with all of the
connectivity, reliability, software choices and versatility that
Linux offers. Support for Linux within the British Antarctic Survey
and Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research is increasing.
Indeed, it is an officially supported operating system at both
institutions and not a toy which the IT hackers play with.</p><p>Many more users are requesting Linux for reasons as diverse
as wanting to run geophysical processing software on remote islands
in the southern Atlantic to simply wanting to run their PC as an
intelligent X terminal. Today Linux offers a truly cost-effective
off-the-shelf solution for all of our requirements that rivals
anything else available in the marketplace. Linux is now being
recognized for what it is-a truly outstanding operating system that
has grown immensely over the last few years thanks to dedicated
individuals and groups working in cooperation with others.</p></div></div>
