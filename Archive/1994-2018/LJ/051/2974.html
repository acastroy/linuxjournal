    This month Mr. Lerner gives us a look at mod-perl, a module for
    the
    Apache web server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c84a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
standard has been around for several years and is beginning to show
its age. CGI is great because all web servers support it,
programmers can write in any language, and programs can be portable
across a large number of platforms. Netscape's NSAPI and
Microsoft's ISAPI bind more tightly to their respective web
servers, but programmers interested in using these APIs are much
more restricted than with CGI.
</p><p>A particularly big problem with CGI is its inefficiency. Each
invocation of a CGI program creates a new process on the server. If
you write CGI programs in Perl, you are starting a new copy of Perl
each time a CGI program runs, using additional memory and processor
time. Wouldn't it be nice if we could have the flexibility of CGI
programs without having to use all of those system resources?
Better yet, wouldn't it be great if we could use our existing CGI
programs in such a framework with little or no modification? The
answer, of course, is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; even as hardware continues to get
cheaper and more powerful, it seems silly to be wasting memory and
CPU time unnecessarily.</p><p>This month, we look at
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>--one of the proposed
solutions to this problem. mod_perl is a module for the popular and
powerful Apache web server, which runs on many operating systems
including Linux. At the most basic level, mod_perl makes it
possible to run server-side Perl programs more efficiently than
when using the CGI protocol. However, mod_perl offers much more
than efficiency, as we will see. It also provides a full interface
to the Apache internals, giving Perl programmers a chance to modify
the web server itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c86b8"></a>Retrieving and Installing mod_perl</h2></div></div><p>Apache modules are configured and installed at compile time.
If you are interested in installing mod_perl, you have to download
and recompile the source code in Apache. Luckily, this is rather
easy to do. Note that while anyone can download, configure and
compile Apache, only someone with root access can install Apache to
its default position. If you don't have root access, you will still
be able to run, but only on an unrestricted port number, namely,
one above 1024.</p><p>The latest version of mod_perl is always available from CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). At this time, the latest
version of mod_perl is 1.10, which means that you can retrieve it
from
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Apache/mod_perl-1.10.tar.gz.
Later versions will have the same URL, with a different version
number. In addition, try to use a CPAN mirror close to you, rather
than loading down www.perl.com; go to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ for
help in finding one.</p><p>Once you have downloaded mod_perl, you will also have to
download the latest version of Apache, 1.2.6, from
http://www.apache.org/ or one of its mirrors. Unpack the Apache and
mod_perl distributions in the same directory. On my system, I did
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /downloads
tar -zxvf apache_1.2.6.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mod_perl-1.10.tar.gz
</pre><p>If you want to modify the default Apache module set, now is
the time to modify /src/Configuration. If you are not familiar with
Apache configuration, don't worry&mdash;things will work just fine
without customizing the module set.
</p><p>The rest of the Apache configuration and compilation is done
within the mod_perl directory. Move into the mod_perl directory
(probably called something like mod_perl-1.10) and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
</pre><p>On my system, mod_perl asks me two questions:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Configure mod_perl with ../apache_1.2.6/src ? [y]
</pre>


to which I press <b  >return</b>, and
<pre     class="programlisting">
Shall I build httpd in ../apache_1.2.6/src for you? [y]
</pre>


to which I press <b  >return</b> again. This configures
all of the files necessary for building mod_perl and Apache. When
the UNIX shell prompt returns, simply type <b  >make</b>
and press <b  >return</b>. The resulting Apache binary
(<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>) will be in the src
subdirectory under the Apache directory. On my system, httpd
resides in /usr/sbin/httpd, so copying the resulting binary will
replace the old Apache with the new one.
</p><p>Restart Apache by logging in as root and typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -1 -v httpd
</pre><p>Now, you're in business with your new version of Apache. If
you're not sure whether the new version has been installed, connect
to the web server and ask for its version information:
<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet localhost 80
</pre>


After connecting, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
</pre>


On my system, I get the following response:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 12 Apr 1998 19:02:41 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.6 mod_perl/1.10
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
</pre>


In other words, the web server running on port 80 (the default port
for HTTP traffic) is running Apache 1.2.6, with mod_perl 1.10
compiled in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c8ea0"></a>Configuring Apache for mod_perl</h2></div></div><p>One of the most popular uses for mod_perl is as a fast
replacement for CGI. In order to use it this way, we need to modify
Apache's configuration files, so it knows how to handle programs
that use mod_perl.</p><p>Why must Apache know how to treat these programs? Thinking
about CGI programs should make it clear. Browsers request CGI
programs in exactly the way they request static documents. The
browser does not know whether a given URL points to a program or a
static document; that determination is made by the server. If the
request is for a static document, the server returns the document
verbatim to the user's browser. If the request is for a program,
the server executes it and returns any output to the user's
browser.</p><p>In both of these cases, the browser's behavior is the same:
it sends the request to the server and displays the contents of any
received response. This places the onus on the server to recognize
which files are to be transmitted verbatim, and which are programs
whose output will be sent as a response. Apache lets us choose
between allowing CGI programs to be located anywhere on the system
(as long as they end with an agreed-upon suffix, such as .pl or
.cgi) and requiring that they be located in one or more designated
directories. This is done using directives in the Apache
configuration files.</p><p>Now that we have added mod_perl to our server, we must tell
Apache how to handle three types of URLs: static documents, CGI
programs and mod_perl programs. Adding mod_perl to the mix does not
have to change the existing configuration on your system. I created
a directory named perl-bin under my web root directory
(/home/httpd/perl-bin) and decided all mod_perl programs would
reside there, just as all CGI programs reside in cgi-bin. I then
added the following lines to my server's srm.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /perl-bin&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Registry
Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  >&lt;Location&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/Location&gt;</b> tags indicate that we want our
settings to take effect for a particular directory, rather than the
entire Apache server. Then, we tell Apache to treat documents in
the perl-bin directory as Perl scripts, rather than static
documents or something else. If you are curious, the Apache manual
has an entire section describing handlers, including the
<b  >AddHandler</b> and <b  >SetHandler</b>
directives that allow us to configure file types according to
location or file extension. Other handlers, for instance, include
cgi-script (for CGI programs), server-info (for information about
the server) and imap-file (for image maps).
</p><p>Now that Apache knows which files in /perl-bin should be
considered mod_perl programs, we must tell mod_perl how to handle
these Perl documents. We will use the
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Registry</b></span> module, which
allows us to run CGI programs. Finally, we will use the
<b  >Options</b> directive to allow CGI programs to be
run within this directory.</p><p>Finally, we make one last modification to srm.conf, telling
mod_perl to produce HTTP headers. We do that outside of the
<b  >&lt;Location&gt;</b> directive, since we always want
mod_perl to return complete headers. The line to add is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlSendHeader On
</pre><p>Adding the PerlSendHeader directive does not relieve us from
the responsibility of indicating the type of content we are
returning. In other words, we still must add the &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo;
header to the top of our output, just as we do when writing CGI
programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c9528"></a>Basic Programs with mod_perl</h2></div></div><p>All the pieces are now in place to use mod_perl instead of
CGI programs. Let's try a simple program that prints out the
current state of the environment. Copy the following into a file
called test.pl in the perl-bin directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use strict;
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
foreach my $key (sort keys %ENV)
{
print "\"$key\" =
\"$ENV{$key}\"&lt;BR&gt;\n";
}
</pre><p>Set permissions so that the file is executable, and ask your
browser to retrieve /perl-bin/test.pl. If all goes well, you will
see a list of environment variables in your browser.
</p><p>If you have been writing CGI programs (or using Perl for any
length of time), then the above might seem strange. For example,
where is the initial line indicating the location of the Perl
interpreter, as well as its switches? The initial hash-bang (#!)
syntax which we are so accustomed to is missing because it's
unnecessary. That two-character code tells the UNIX shell that it
shouldn't try to interpret a program (i.e., as a shell script), but
rather that it should give the responsibility to another program.
That's why Perl programs usually begin with the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
</pre><p>while Tcl programs begin with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/tclsh
</pre>


and so forth. Because our program is run by mod_perl and mod_perl
understands Perl programs, we don't need the hash-bang syntax at
the top of our program.
</p><p>Command-line switches raise a more subtle issue, one that
cuts to the heart of mod_perl's advantages over standard CGI
programs. Programs run much faster under mod_perl for several
reasons, but the two primary ones are that Perl is embedded in
Apache (saving the overhead of starting Perl with each invocation),
and programs are compiled once, then cached (saving the overhead of
compilation with each invocation). The combination of embedding
Perl within Apache and caching compiled programs can mean a
tremendous boost in execution speed, often ranging from 400 percent
to 2000 percent.</p><p>There are tradeoffs for these increases in speed, and one of
them is that command-line switches no longer work as expected.
Switches are handled at compilation time, so if you expect switches
to work each time your program is run, you will be disappointed.
However, all is not lost. Programmers interested in turning on
Perl's warnings (the <b  >-w</b> flag) and security
checks (the <b  >-T</b> flag, for tainting) from within
mod_perl programs can do so with a directive inside of the srm.conf
file. To turn on warnings, you simply add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlWarn On
</pre><p>This has the effect of turning on warnings from within your
programs. As usual, warning messages are sent to the Apache error
log.
</p><p>By the same token, you can activate Perl's security checks
(commonly known as &ldquo;tainting&rdquo;) by adding the
<b  >PerlTaintCheck</b> directive inside of
srm.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlTaintCheck On
</pre><p>When you write CGI programs (or any other programs, for that
matter) in Perl, it is usually a good idea to include the
<b  >use strict</b> directive, as we saw in the above
example. When programming with mod_perl, however, it is extremely
important to <b  >use strict</b>. Otherwise, variable
definitions may remain in memory after your program exits, creating
problems for future invocations of this or other programs.
</p><p>By the same token, do not use the
<span   class="bold"><b>exit</b></span> function to leave your
program prematurely. Normally, calling exit from within a CGI
program will end the program&mdash;not a bad thing, if it has already
produced all of its output. If you call exit from within a mod_perl
program, the program takes Perl along with it; and since Perl is
embedded within the copy of Apache, killing Perl effectively kills
that particular server process as well. If you absolutely must call
exit from within your program, use
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::exit</b></span> instead; it will do
what you want without unexpected side effects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c05f8"></a>CGI Programs with mod_perl</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have gone through a basic introduction to
mod_perl and writing CGI-style programs with Apache::Registry,
let's look at an example of CGI programs under mod_perl&mdash;a simple
guest book program that takes form parameters and appends their
contents to a file on the system. The form is shown in
<a href="2974l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a> Note that the form
looks just like the forms we have seen in the past. The sole
difference is our form's action, which sits in perl-bin rather than
the usual cgi-bin.</p><p>The program is shown in <a href="2974l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2.</a> If we were to add a &ldquo;hash-bang&rdquo; first line to this
program, it would operate equally well under CGI or mod_perl
environments. We use CGI.pm to retrieve information about the
submitted form. While this works just fine for recent versions of
CGI.pm, earlier versions are not completely compatible with
Apache::Registry.</p><p>The main difference between the program in Listing 2 and its
CGI counterpart is speed. While I cannot give exact numbers, my
subjective tests showed the response from mod_perl to be almost
instantaneous, with the CGI version taking noticeably
longer&mdash;perhaps up to one second. This might not seem like much,
but the combination of a cached CGI program with an already-running
version of Perl is impressive, even with a short program that
compiles quickly. As you can see, it does not require many changes
to your original program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c0860"></a>A non-CGI use of mod_perl</h2></div></div><p>So far, I have mentioned mod_perl only as a replacement for
CGI. However, mod_perl is much more than that; it gives you a Perl
interface to the guts of Apache. If you have configured your server
correctly, you can modify every aspect of Apache using a Perl
program. Better yet, some enterprising souls have already spent
time writing modules which do just that. For example, the
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Status</b></span> module allows you
to take a look at the current state of mod_perl running on your
server. Apache::Status comes with mod_perl and is a good example of
what can be done with this package.</p><p>As was the case with Apache::Registry, we are going to have
to set the handlers for a particular directory. In this case, the
directory does not have to physically exist on the disk, since the
URL is interpreted before a file is ever opened. You must add these
lines to your srm.conf file in order to get the Perl status:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /perl-status&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Status
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>As was the case with Apache::Registry, we set the Apache
handler to be <b  >perl-script</b>. Since we want
Apache::Status to be handling the perl-status directory, we point
to it as our <b  >PerlHandler</b>.
</p><p>If you put the above lines in your server's srm.conf file and
restart the server, anyone requesting /perl-status from your server
is going to have access to information about your server. If you
would prefer to keep such information private, you must use access
controls, as shown in the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /perl-status&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Status
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 127.
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>This allows you to retrieve status information from the
server computer itself; attempts to retrieve /perl-status from
another computer will be greeted with an &ldquo;unauthorized access&rdquo;
message.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d0580.0x23c0c80"></a>What Next?</h2></div></div><p>I have been surprised and impressed by mod_perl's speed and
flexibility, and I expect to use it more and more as time goes on.
The fact that it can run most existing CGI programs without
modification is a great boon to those of us who already have a
stockpile of such programs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> is not a panacea,
of course. Its speed comes at a price; namely, greater demands for
system memory. The inclusion of Perl (a known memory hog) inside of
Apache means that the httpd processes on your server will start off
larger than otherwise. Over time, each server process will grow, as
compiled Perl programs are cached in memory. Before you use
mod_perl on your system, you should make some calculations
regarding the amount of memory that Apache is using; this may
affect the number of server processes you want to run on your
system.</p><p>Nevertheless, mod_perl is a tremendous advance for both
Apache and Perl and promises to get much better with time. Next
month, we will look at some of the ways in which mod_perl can speed
up our database connections, making Apache an even better server
for dynamic sites dependent on relational databases.</p><p><a href="2974s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
