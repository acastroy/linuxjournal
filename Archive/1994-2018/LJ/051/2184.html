    Yorick is an interpreted language for numerical analysis
    used by scientists on machines from Linux laptops to Cray
    supercomputers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x1297450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux leverages a vast amount of academic
software, either easy ports of existing UNIX packages or,
increasingly in recent years, software that is ready to run under
Linux. One example is Yorick, and this article is an attempt to
provide a brief overview of the nature and capabilities of this
system.
</p><p>Yorick is not just another calculator. Readable syntax, array
notation and powerful I/O and graphics capabilities make Yorick a
favorite tool for scientific numerical analysis.
Machine-independent I/O, using the standard NetCDF file formats,
simplifies moving applications between hardware architectures.
Yorick is an interpreted language developed by David H. Munro at
Livermore Labs. Implemented in C, it is freely distributed under a
liberal copyright. Yorick runs on a vast range of machines, from
486SX Linux Laptops (in my case) to Cray YMP supercomputers.</p><p>Who uses Yorick? The majority of users are physicists, many
with access to the most powerful computers in the world. Specific
applications include Astrophysics, Astronomy, Neurosciences,
Medical Image Processing and Fusion Research.</p><p>In this article I will discuss the basics of running Yorick,
describe the key array operations, and briefly discuss array
operations, programming and graphics. I hope that this quick look
is enough to get the more mathematically inclined readers to give
Yorick a try.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x1297660"></a>Basic Operations</h2></div></div><p>When invoked without arguments, Yorick presents a typical
command-line interface. Expressions are evaluated immediately, and
the result is displayed. Primitive types include integers,
floating-point values and strings. All the built-in functions and
constants you would expect to be present are present. Variable
names are unadorned, with no leading $ character and need not be
pre-declared. C-style comments are supported.</p><p>One might not expect an interpreted language to be suitable
for numerical analysis, and indeed, this would be the case if
arrays were not built into the language. Arrays are first-class
objects that can be operated on with a single operation. Since the
virtual machine understands arrays, it can apply optimized compiled
subroutines to array operations, eliminating the speed penalty of
the interpreter.</p><p>Arrays can be created explicitly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a1 = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5]
</pre><p>Elements can be accessed singly or as a subset, with
<b  >1</b> being the origin. Parentheses indicate the
indexing operation, and a single index or a range of indices can be
specified.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a1
[1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5]
&gt; a1(2)
1.2
&gt; a1(1:3)
[1.1,1.2,1.3]
</pre>


Since array operations are built into the language, functions
applied to the array are automatically applied to all elements at
once.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; sqrt(a1)
[1.04881,1.09545,1.14018,1.18322,1,2.23607]
</pre>


Arrays are not limited in dimension. The rank (number of indices)
of an array is not limited to one (a vector) or two (a matrix), but
can be as large as desired. Arrays of rank 3 can be used to
represent the distribution of a parameter across a volume, and an
array of rank 4 could model this over time.
</p><p>Yorick also provides a simple but effective help system.
Executing the help command describes the help system. Executing it
with a command name as an argument provides information on that
command.</p><p>Yorick provides a complete programming language that closely
matches C in terms of control flow, expressions and variable usage.
For example, the statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; for(i=1; i&lt;10; i++) { print,1&lt;&lt;i; }
</pre><p>will print the powers of two just as you would expect.
Function declarations, introduced with <b  >func</b>,
also work as expected:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; func csc(x) {
&gt; return 1/sin(x);
&gt; }
</pre>


There are differences&mdash;variables need not be declared, and arrays
are much more powerful than in C. The major difference is in
function invocation. Passing arguments to a function in parentheses
causes an evaluation and printing of the result; however, passing
arguments separated by commas simply executes the function and does
not return the result. Since in most cases intermediate results are
not required, many scripts contain function calls of the form f,x,y
rather than the more familiar f(x,y).
</p><p>Having a programming language close to C allows easy
migration between Yorick for prototyping and C for final
implementation. However, as several Yorick users have indicated,
moving to C is often unnecessary&mdash;the Yorick program proved to be
fast enough to get the job done with a minimum of programming
effort.</p><p>If C extensions are required, a straightforward framework
allows extending the Yorick command language with whatever new
operations are necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x1297c90"></a>Advanced Array Operations</h2></div></div><p>Yorick has a compact and sophisticated mechanism for
describing array indexing and operations, which are used to
precisely specify the desired operation to the interpreter.
Applying an operation to an array causes the operation to be
applied to each element of the array. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5]
&gt; sqrt(a)
[1,1.41421,1.73205,2,2.23607]
</pre><p>What about multiplying two vectors? The default is to perform
an element by element multiplication.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; b = [2,4,6,8,10]
&gt; a*b
[2,8,18,32,50]
</pre>


Those of you who remember physics or linear algebra will recall
inner and outer products. The inner product is defined as the sum
of the pairwise products:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a(+)*b(+)
110
</pre>


The outer product creates a matrix out of each possible
multiplication:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a(-,)*b(,-)
[[2,4,6,8,10],
 [4,8,12,16,20],
 [6,12,18,24,30],
 [8,16,24,32,40],
 [10,20,30,40,50]]
</pre>


The <b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b> symbols, used
where an index would be placed, are called special subscripts and
provide precise control over how array operations are executed. The
<b  >+</b> is the matrix multiplication pseudo-index,
which indicates to Yorick along which dimension the addition part
of a matrix multiply should be performed. The <b  >-</b>
is a pseudo-index, creating an index where one did not exist
before.
</p><p>The rank-reducing operators <b  >sum</b>,
<b  >min</b>, <b  >max</b> and
<b  >avg</b> can be used in place of indices.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a(max)
5
&gt; b(avg)
6
</pre><p>One might wonder why this is necessary, when the equivalent
function operators (i.e., <span   class="bold"><b>min()</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>avg()</b></span>) exist? The reason is that
for matrices of rank 2 or greater, the rank-reducing index
operators allow you to specify exactly how to perform the
operation. For example, given a 3x3 array, do you want to average
across rows, columns or the entire array?
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; c = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
&gt; dimsof(c)
[2,3,3]
&gt; avg(c)
5
&gt; c(avg,avg)
5
&gt; c(avg,)
[2,5,8]
&gt; c(,avg)
[4,5,6]
</pre>


Here we have also introduced the
<span   class="bold"><b>dimsof()</b></span> function operator, which
reports the dimensions of the argument. In this case, the result
tells us that <b  >c</b> is an array of rank 2 with three
elements in each direction.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x12984d0"></a>Graphics Operations</h2></div></div><p>Under Linux, Yorick is linked with the GIST graphics
subsystem, allowing immediate display of plots and diagrams. Plots
are interactive, allowing the user to zoom in and out, stretch
axes, and crop the displays using the mouse. Yorick is capable of
displaying sequences of plots over time as in a movie, and because
of this, the command to prepare for a new image is
<span   class="bold"><b>fma</b></span> or frame advance.</p><p>To plot the value of a function at evenly spaced points, we
must first create the <b  >x</b> values:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; x = span(0,10,256)
&gt; dimsof(x)
[1,256]
</pre><p><b  >x</b> is now a 256-element array with values
that range from 0 to 10.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2184f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. x-y Plot
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>plg</b></span> function, given
vectors for the <b  >x</b> and <b  >y</b>
values, plots x-y graphs.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
plg, sin(x^2), x
</pre><p>The results of this command are shown in Figure 1. Note that
the arguments are supplied <b  >y,x</b> (not
<b  >x,y</b>). This allows Yorick to supply a default
<b  >x</b> vector (ranging from <b  >1</b> to
the number of <b  >y</b> points), if desired.
</p><p>Parametric plots are also supported. Consider the following
commands which produced the spiral in Figure 2:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;GT; window, style="vgbox.gs"
&amp;GT; a = span(0,20,256)
&amp;GT; x = a * sin(a)
&amp;GT; y = a * cos(a)
&amp;GT; plg, y, x
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2184f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Spiral Plot
</p></div></div><p>Surface plots are also available, either as a wire frame as
in Figure 3:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&amp;GT; #include "plwf.i"
&gt; orient3
&gt; x = span(-pi,pi,32)(,-:1:32)
&gt; y = transpose(x)
&gt; fma
&gt; plwf, sin(x)*cos(y)
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2184f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Wire Frame Surface Plot
</p></div></div><p>Or a shaded surface rendition as in Figure 4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; fma
&gt; plwf, sin(x)*cos(y), shade=1, edges=0
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2184f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Shaded Surface Plot
</p></div></div><p>A host of advanced graphics options are used in the
demonstration programs distributed with Yorick, and the latest copy
of the documentation has an extensive description of graphics
options. In addition, libraries to read, write, and display
PNM-format images are provided.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x128fd88"></a>Closing Remarks</h2></div></div><p>Yorick is an exceptionally rich environment for numerical
analysis. Many of its capabilities such as file I/O, debugging,
animation and distributed operation using MPY have not been
explored in this article. Please take the time to read through the
documentation and the example programs. You will not be
disappointed.</p><p><a href="2184s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article was first published in Issue 26 of LinuxGazette.com,
