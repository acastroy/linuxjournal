make it to the screen which asks if you have a color monitor,

the boot disk on my kid's computer and it works fine. There is not
a lot of difference between my computer and my kid's, but here are

Thanks for any help you can give me.</p><p>&mdash;Bruce Matthews Red Hat 4.2</p><p>It sounds as if the kernel doesn't care for your video card.
This is highly unusual, but it may be the case. Try a different
video card to see if it helps. You might also try the boot disks
from Red Hat 5.0 to see if a newer kernel helps with the problem.
If so, you may have to use the newer version.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x1f71e48"></a>Crashing XFree86</h2></div></div><p>While using XFree86 3.3.1, it will crash unexpectedly and

Fatal server error: Caught signal 4.

returns <b  >11</b>, but the rest of the message is the
same. This usually happens when I'm opening or using a program.
</p><p>&mdash;Aaron Walker Red Hat 5.0</p><p>This may point to a faulty memory chip. Try stress testing
your system, e.g., by compiling a huge package with optimization,
such as your usual kernel compile. If a similar thing happens, it's
the memory.</p><p>&mdash;Ralf W. Stephan stephan@tmt.de</p><p>This is usually indicative of a hardware problem. You should
take a look at http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/ for information on
how to determine if this is the case and how to fix it.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x1f72268"></a>Damage After a Crash</h2></div></div><p>My /var partition filled to 100% recently (I installed some
alpha software that bombed 40MB of logs), and basically, I crashed.
On reboot, there was damage to the file systems, so I know some
things are broken.</p><p>My &lt;path&gt;/lost+found directories contain some chunks of
data after running <span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span>, and I
assume I can do something to discover what has been damaged and
reinstall those packages. How do I do that?</p><p>The specific problems I'm now having are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>xdm launches the xserver, but the login screen does
not come up and the background graphic is a very large text &ldquo;Red
Hat Linux&rdquo;. I think this is probably related to #2.</p></li><li><p>bash (and other shells) can't seem to find/execute
scripts. <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> sees them and
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> edits them, but bash says it
can't find them on execute attempts. Thanks in advance.</p></li></ol></div><p>&mdash;Rob Collins Red Hat 5.0 </p><p>First, you can go to the lost+found directories and
use the <b  >file</b> command to see
what type of data they are. Then use an appropriate viewer to look
at the file. For ASCII text you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>, etc. For files of type
&ldquo;data&rdquo;, a good way to figure out what they are is to run
<b  >strings <i><tt>filename</tt></i> |
less</b> to look at any strings that appear in the
file. Those strings may yield some clues.</p><p>The next thing you'll want to do is run
<b  >rpm -Va</b> on your system. That will tell
you about any files existing in your RPM database that have changed
in any way. Some of them are normal (things in /dev, for example),
but it should be easy to tell what else has changed. Look at the
man page for RPM (<b  >man rpm</b>)
for an explanation of the Va output. Once you find files
that have changed or are missing, you will want to fix them. The
best way is to reinstall the package completely.</p><p>Both of your problems will probably be fixed by going through
the above steps.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x1f72b00"></a>Interlace Mode</h2></div></div><p>How do I take my monitor out of interlaced mode? I run it in

non-interlaced. I use the FVWM window manager. Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Cliff Slackware 2.3</p><p>In order to change the mode in which X will be running, you
need to change the XF86config file, generally located in the
/etc/X11 directory. This file contains important information about
your X server, such as the horizontal/vertical frequencies
supported by your monitor. Editing this file by hand can be tricky,
so I suggest you:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Back up your running XF86config. (Do a
<b  >find&nbsp;/&nbsp;-name&nbsp;XF86config</b>

multi-serial port (DigiBoard Xem 16 RS232 ports). I loaded in the
2.0.30 kernel sources from InfoMagic and recompiled the kernel to
recognize the DigiBoard. I used a boot disk to boot-up Linux, but
it didn't work. Each time, it hangs, and the error message returned
is &ldquo;vfs: kernel panic... etc.&rdquo;</p><p>The original kernel on the boot disk works, but any
recompilation of the kernel causes that error message. The
DigiBoard module is loaded properly before the error
appears.</p><p>I need to set the machine up urgently, and yet I'm stuck. I
need help. Thank you.</p><p>&mdash;Weng-Yue Boey InfoMagic 2.0.30</p><p>Unfortunately, what you've described seems to be a hardware
problem (bad cache, bad memory). You say that you can run any
precompiled kernel, but if you try compiling yours (or any other
huge program), you end up with a &ldquo;got signal 11...&rdquo;
message.</p><p>I would suggest turning off the cache or removing some of the
memory, then try compiling once more.</p><p>&mdash;Mario de Mello Bittencourt Neto mneto@buriti.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x236b590"></a>Firewall Troubles</h2></div></div><p>I am setting up a firewall and masquerade at my office to
service approximately fifty workstations. The masquerade will be
used to allow multiple users to access the Internet with a private
IP addressing scheme (10.0.0.0\8), and the firewalling is for added
security. I have successfully implemented masquerading in both a
test and production environment; I have been successful with the
firewall only in a test environment.</p><p>The problem in the test environment is when I change to the
/sbin/init.d directory and attempt to execute <b  >firewall
list</b>, I get a &ldquo;command not found&rdquo; error. The firewall
script is present in that directory. <b  >firewall
start</b> and <b  >firewall stop</b> also will not
execute.</p><p>Any suggestions on where to go next would be appreciated.
Thanks,</p><p>&mdash;Doug Ford S.u.S.E. 5.0</p><p>It sounds like your current directory isn't
included in your PATH. You can either set your PATH to include the
current directory (generally a bad idea for root) or just prepend
the command you want to run with <b  >./</b>,
for example, <b  >./firewall
stop</b>.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Bishop mark@bish.midwest.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x236ba08"></a>Adding an Ethernet Driver to the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>My Ethernet card was installed improperly. How do I add a new
Ethernet driver into the kernel? I mean, how do I recompile the

<b  >make menuconfig</b> and when you're
done, <b  >make zImage</b>. The new
kernel is then in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/. Put it somewhere
else, such as the / directory, preferably with a new name, then
configure and run LILO. (You should keep your old kernel in
lilo.cfg in case the new one has problems.)
