    This article gives a quick introduction to the programming
    language Icon, developed at the University of Arizona.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x1209920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux users are early adopters of new
technology, so it's not surprising that many in the Linux community
wish to use the best programming language for a given application,
rather than being limited to just one language. The purpose of this
article is to tell you about one of the simplest and most powerful
programming languages available. It's called Icon, and it is a
language for people who love programming. This tutorial is a
&ldquo;teaser&rdquo; meant to pique your curiosity; the April 1998 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> has a longer tutorial which goes
into more detail about the features described here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x1209a80"></a>My Programming Language Can Beat Up Your
Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>Languages are the subject of religious wars; very little is
gained by arguments &ldquo;proving&rdquo; one language is better than
another. Icon is not perfect, nor is it the &ldquo;best&rdquo; language&mdash;but
it is a very nice language to use. Icon is for people who don't
want to deal with memory management in C or C++; for people who
want the power of Perl and beyond, but prefer a cleaner expression
syntax and fewer special cases; and for people who have a use for
rich data structures and algorithms, but take for granted all the
programming building blocks they learned in school. Icon is used
for children's games, scripture analysis, CGI scripts, compiler
research, literate programming, system administration and
visualization. It is in many ways what BASIC should be and what
Perl and Java could have been. (If you know a language that allows
simpler and more direct solutions to the three short, complete
program examples given in this article, please tell us about
it.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x1209b88"></a>Icon: Listing the Basics</h2></div></div><p>Icon's basic philosophy is to make programming easy. Its
syntax is similar to C or Pascal; programs are composed of
procedures, starting from <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span>.
Icon's built-in list and table data types beat out most languages:
other languages have similar types but just don't seem to do the
operators and semantics as nicely. Both types use familiar
subscript notation, hold values of any type and grow or shrink as
needed. Lists take the place of arrays, stacks and queues. Tables
associate keys of any type with corresponding values. These types
are ingeniously implemented; for example, lists are like arrays
when you use them like arrays, and like linked lists when you use
them like linked lists.</p><p>Although Icon has some exotic concepts compared with C or
FORTRAN, in several ways Icon programs are <span   class="emphasis"><em>more
readable</em></span>, not just shorter. For example, when they are
&ldquo;true&rdquo;, the relational operators return the value of the right
operand, and associate left to right, so <b  >(12 &lt; x &lt;
20)</b> tests whether x is between 12 and 20.</p><p>Here is a silly sample program that counts the number of
occurrences of each word given on its command line and writes the
words out in alphabetical order, along with their corresponding
counts. A table is created with all keys mapping to a default value
of 0. Then, each argument on the command line is used as a key in
the table to increment a counter. The table is sorted, producing a
list of two-element lists containing the keys and their values.
These pairs are removed from the list one at a time, and the keys
and values are written out.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
procedure main(argv)
 T := table(0)
 every T[ !argv ] +:= 1
 L := sort(T)
 while pair := pop(L) do
 write(pair[1], ": ", pair[2])
end
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x1209ea0"></a>The Joy of Generators</h2></div></div><p>Generators are Icon's unique feature; they are its computer
science research contribution. They give the language simpler, more
intuitive notation, so they are worth making a mental leap.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Generators</em></span> can produce more than one value,
and expression evaluation tries each value from a generator until
it finds one that makes the enclosing expression succeed and
produce a value. For example, <b  >(2|3|5|7)</b> is a
simple expression that produces the values 2, 3, 5 and 7; so the
expression <b  >(x = (2|3|5|7))</b> tests if the value of
<b  >x</b> is one of those four values.</p><p>In the previous program example, the expression
<b  >!argv</b> generated the elements from the list
<b  >argv</b>. Expression evaluation tries to obtain a
value; the <b  >every</b> control structure causes
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the values to be produced. This
code</p><pre     class="programlisting">
every i := (1 to 10) | (20 to 30) do
 write(L[i])
</pre><p>prints the first ten values from the list, followed by
elements 20 through 30.
</p><p>Generators are a very natural way to write procedures that
compute a sequence of values. In a language like C, the procedure
has to maintain its state between calls using static data; in Icon,
this is done automatically. Here's one way you might write a
web-link checker:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
every url := get_url(document) do
 test_url(url)
</pre><p>The procedure <b  >get_url</b> scans the document
for hyperlinks:
<pre     class="programlisting">
procedure get_url(filename)
 f := open(filename) |
 stop("Couldn't open ", filename)
 while line := read(f) do {
 ...
 url := ...
 suspend url
 }
end
</pre>


In the above example, <b  >get_url</b> is called only
once. Each time a <b  >suspend</b> occurs, a result is
produced for the surrounding expression, and if the surrounding
expression fails, the call is resumed where it left off, at the
<b  >suspend</b>. Generators are the basis for additional
powerful language features (see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>
article for details).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x120a688"></a>Graphics and User Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>Icon's built-in graphics have about 40 functions and
introduce only one new type, the window, which is a special
extension of the file type. This contrasts with graphics APIs in
other languages where learning graphics means learning 400 or more
functions that manipulate several dozen new types of values.
Passing strings and integers into a few functions is all you need
to write amazing graphics without excessive code.</p><p>One demonstration of Icon graphics is Brad Myers'
&ldquo;rectangle-follows-mouse&rdquo; test, a program that opens up a window
in which a rectangle follows a mouse around on the screen. A window
is opened (file mode &ldquo;g&rdquo;) with an XOR raster drawing operation
that causes graphics to erase themselves when redrawn. In the loop,
for each user event, the ten-pixel square is erased and redrawn at
the new mouse location. <b  >&amp;x</b> and
<b  >&amp;y</b> are Icon keywords which hold the current
mouse location and are saved in variables <b  >x</b> and
<b  >y</b>. The variables <b  >x</b> and
<b  >y</b> start out as null. The expression
<b  >\x</b> fails if <b  >x</b> is null,
causing the first call to DrawRectangle to be skipped the first
time through the loop, since at this point, there is no rectangle
to draw.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
procedure main()
 w := open("win","g", "drawop=reverse")
 repeat {
 # get mouse/keyboard event
 Event(w)
 # erase old rectangle
 DrawRectangle(w, \x, y, 10, 10)
 # draw new rectangle
 DrawRectangle(w, x := &amp;x, y := &amp;y, 10, 10)
 }
end
</pre><p>Simple graphics programming is easy, but complex graphics are
also possible. The Icon Program Library (IPL), a collection of Icon
utilities and libraries, offers a more extensive Motif-style user
interface toolkit as well as a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
get) interface builder that lets you build interfaces by drawing
them. The IPL contains several other examples of graphical games
and applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x120ab58"></a>POSIX Made Simple</h2></div></div><p>The Unicon flavor of Icon adds an elegant set of UNIX
system-level facilities. An ultra-simple version of the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> utility illustrates some of
these features. This version takes a directory name on the command
line and produces a listing of file information including file size
and modified time, sorted by name. (A more interesting version is
included in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> article.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> reads the directory and
performs a <span   class="bold"><b>stat</b></span> call on each name
it finds. In Icon, opening a directory is exactly the same as
opening a file for reading; every <span   class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span> returns
one file name.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$include "posix.icn"
procedure main(argv)
 f := open(argv[1]) |
 stop("ls: ", sys_errstr(&amp;errno))
 names := list()
 while name := read(f) do
 push(names, name)
 every name := !sort(names) do {
 p := lstat(name)
 write(p.size, "   ", ctime(p.mtime)[5:17],
 " ", name)
 }
end
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>lstat</b></span> function returns a
record with all the information that <b  >lstat(2)</b>
returns. In the Icon version, the
<span   class="bold"><b>mode</b></span> field is given as a human
readable string&mdash;not an integer to which you must apply bitwise
magic. Also, in Icon, string manipulation is very natural.
</p><p>Give Icon a try; whether you're a programmer or not, you'll
love it.</p><p><a href="2354s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
