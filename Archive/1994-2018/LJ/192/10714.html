The Motorola DROID is a serious contender in the smartphone world.
Android just keeps getting better.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c0250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;But does it run Linux?&rdquo; is a common refrain in some circles whenever a
shiny new gadget hits the streets. In the case of the Motorola DROID,
I am pleased to say it does, in the form of Google's Android mobile
operating system version 2.0 (running Linux kernel version 2.6.29).
</p><p>
With its big, beautiful screen, fast processor, full qwerty keyboard and
utilitarian looks, is the DROID a serious contender for the smartphone
crown or just another pretender that's too little, too late?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c0510"></a>
Call Quality and Experience</h2></div></div><p>
Let's cover the basics first: call quality. It is a phone, after all. As a
longtime user of another carrier and having had no prior experience with Verizon, I
was pleasantly surprised by just how good the DROID (and the Verizon network)
sounded. The improvement was noticeable to people I speak to regularly.
The external speaker is well suited to its primary roles of speakerphone and
ringtone playback, and it actually does a really nice job in media playback as well
(an obvious lack of punch in the low end notwithstanding).
</p><p>
The dial pad is clean and well spaced, with large buttons. Once connected to a
call, the buttons for doing useful actions (speaker, mute, three-way call
and so on)
are right where you need them to be (Figure 1).
There isn't much else to say here. Making and receiving calls
is straightforward and simple.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10714f1.large.jpg"><img src="10714f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Screen</h2></div></div><p>
The screen is the first thing that catches your eye, and it definitely warrants the
attention&mdash;in a word: stunning. In a side-by-side comparison with that other
smartphone, the DROID screen is bigger, brighter, crisper and more clear (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10714f2.large.jpg"><img src="10714f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Scrolling and dragging are smooth and fluid. The haptic feedback
(feedback technology that interacts with one's sense of touch, for example, via
vibration), where implemented, provides just the right amount of
&ldquo;buzz&rdquo;
without being distracting. The response to tapping is good, as long
as you remember to use your fingertip and not your fingernail.
&ldquo;Tap&rdquo;
response does seem to taper off a bit near the top of the phone (when
holding it in portrait mode), but I've noticed this really only in
one application, so I'm not sure if it is the screen or the app.
</p><p>
One thing the DROID screen doesn't do is multitouch (multitouch
technology allows user interaction by touching the screen in more than one
place at the same time). This &ldquo;shortcoming&rdquo; has been well documented, but
I haven't really found it to be a big deal. I am sure my opinion would
be different if I were used to using a phone that did support multitouch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c0ca0"></a>
Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>
Although not quite a holy war like with vi vs. emacs, the presence
(or absence) of a physical keyboard is definitely a polarizing factor
among smartphone aficionados. Based on my previous experience with
touchscreens, I knew going in that I wanted a physical keyboard, and this
one, for the most part, hasn't disappointed.
</p><p>
To expose the keyboard, simply slide the screen up. There's no springs or
hinges, just a satisfying click when fully opened or closed. The lack
of hinges or springs is, in my opinion, a positive, because it lessens the
chances of having a &ldquo;loose screen&rdquo; result from a worn-out mechanism.
It also means less moving parts to break.
</p><p>
The keyboard itself takes up about three-quarters of the full width of the
phone, with the remaining quarter being lost to the slide mechanisms, the
microphone and a directional pad, which functions just like the arrow keys
on a standard keyboard (Figure 3). The presence of the directional pad,
much like the &ldquo;chin&rdquo; on the G1, makes right-hand placement a bit awkward
initially; however, it took only an hour or so of use to adjust. A person
with smaller hands may need a bit more practice to adjust, however.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10714f3.large.jpg"><img src="10714f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The DROID Open Showing the Keyboard and Browser
</p></div></div><p>
All of the keys are the same size, with the exception of the spacebar,
which is three keys wide. The lack of a physical space between the
keys was a concern initially, but is no longer. Each key is bubbled
up slightly in the center. This subtle rise in the center of each key
makes it easier to differentiate between one key and the next as your
thumb slides across the board.
</p><p>
The keyboard is a standard qwerty layout, with each key having an
alternate function. The presence of both an Alt and a Shift key in
both bottom corners makes it very easy to switch lowercase, uppercase,
numbers and symbols. The inclusion of physical keys that replicate the
touchscreen Search and Menu buttons is a nice touch, as it allows
you to use these functions while keeping your hands in typing position.
</p><p>
The most unusual thing about this keyboard is the presence of two unused
&ldquo;keys&rdquo;, one each in the absolute bottom left and right corners. It'd be
great if they were user-programmable, but alas, they don't even click.
Although this isn't really the kind of thing you expect to see on a finished
product, I haven't found myself reaching for a key that isn't there,
perhaps with the exception of having a Ctrl key available when
using an SSH client.
</p><p>
In addition to the physical keyboard, there are also four buttons on the
touchscreen: Back, Menu, Home and Search. Back does exactly what you'd
expect, as does Search. Home drops you back to the main (center)
panel from whatever you were doing, and Menu opens the options and
settings menu in most applications.
</p><p>
Besides the keyboard and soft keys, the DROID has three additional
physical buttons: the power/lock switch, a volume toggle and the camera
button. The power/lock button functions exactly as it should. The same
can be said of the volume toggle, which is smart enough to adjust the
volume of whatever you're doing at the time (that is, call volume, ringer
volume and media playback volume). The placement of the volume toggle does
make it difficult to adjust the volume when the keyboard is exposed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c12d0"></a>
Camera</h2></div></div><p>
I've seen some very nice photos taken with cell phones, and I've seen
an equal number, if not more, of really bad ones. Because of this,
I really had no way to gauge my expectations for the DROID camera.
Now that I've had some time with it, I think the best way to describe
it is that the camera can, in certain situations, take really nice photos.
</p><p>
The hardware is certainly there: 5 megapixel camera, dual function
flash and a physical shutter button that is located on the top-right
side&mdash;just like a point-and-shoot camera when holding the phone in
landscape mode.
</p><p>
It is the software and interface where things aren't as positive. Upon
first launch, I was very disappointed to see that the camera interface
was inconsistent with every other application. A push of the Menu
button while in camera mode doesn't launch the settings/options menu.
Instead, it launches another menu from which you can access the settings.
When opened, the settings panel slides out from the left of the screen,
instead of from the bottom like in all other apps. Those were my initial
thoughts, but after using this for a while, I am starting to think that
the arrangement of the menus and controls was a deliberate attempt to
make them easier to use when holding the phone as a camera (landscape).
If that's the case, kudos to the Android development team for
considering how it will be used and not just blindly making all the apps
the same. My praise for them is diminished, however, by the fact that
it still doesn't work in a manner consistent with what you would expect.
As an example, say you've opened the settings panel, then selected
the flash settings submenu and changed your flash-mode preference.
At this point, tapping the back button closes out all menus and
takes you back to the main camera mode. In contrast, my expectation
(and the behavior for every other app on the phone) is that tapping the
back button while within a menu tree simply takes you up one menu level.
This may not sound like a big deal, but the extra steps are a drag if
you're trying to change more than one setting in a hurry.
</p><p>
Although the menu navigation can be tedious, the most unfortunate and
disappointing drawback with this camera is the lag between button push
and shutter fire when in autofocus mode. The lag actually seems more
pronounced when using the physical shutter button than when using the soft
(on-screen) button. This lag can be avoided by switching the focus from
auto to infinity. The trade-off is, of course, that you lose the benefits
of the autofocus. I don't know if the lag is something that can be fixed
in software, but if it is, let's hope the developers are paying attention.
</p><p>
Regarding shooting mode, the camera has all the usual ones you'd expect
on a typical point-and-shoot camera: auto, portrait, action, snow, beach,
indoor and so on. It also has the usual palette of color effects: black
and
white, sepia, negative, red, blue or green tint and so on.
</p><p>
This certainly isn't meant to be a harsh indictment of the DROID camera.
As I said, in the right circumstances, this camera definitely is capable
of taking a nice photograph. But, let's keep in mind that this is a
camera that's been added on to a phone and not the other way around.
At the end of the day, you aren't going to replace your DSLR with the DROID
(or any other phone for that matter).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c1590"></a>
Battery, Storage, Headphones and USB</h2></div></div><p>
The battery and memory card are housed in a compartment accessible
through a removable panel on the back of the phone, and both are user-replaceable.
The memory type is microSD.
</p><p>
The headphone jack takes a standard 3.5mm plug and is mounted in such
a way as to require no special adapters or extenders.
</p><p>
Data transfer and battery charging are done via USB. The port on the
phone accepts a standard micro USB 5-pin male connector.
</p><p>
These may seem like minor details; however, they bear mentioning because
they are features that aren't always found on other smartphones.
These choices, I believe, are a nod to consumers who are tired of
over-paying for accessories and tired of guessing which USB cable in the
drawer has the right connector for the device at hand.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x29c17f8"></a>
Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The DROID has three panels (think desktops) to hold the most commonly
used applications and widgets. Switching between them is as simple as
a flick of the finger. When started, the center panel is populated
mostly with communications apps (Phone, Contacts, Gmail, Text, Gtalk,
Calendar and so on) and, of course, the search widget. Access to the full
menu of applications is available via a shade window, which slides in from
the bottom of the screen (Figure 4). A long press on an open area of
the panel brings up a menu from which additional application shortcuts or
widgets can be added. A long press, hold and drag is all that is needed to
move icons around on a panel, or from panel to panel. A long press and
hold also temporarily turns the application menu button into a trash can,
should you decide to remove an app or widget from the panel.

Figure 4. The DROID Main (Home) Panel with Application Panel Shade
</p></div></div><p>
One thing that makes the Android interface really stand out is
the Notifications shade. The unsuspecting gray bar along the top of the
screen that displays time, battery status, signal strength and network status
also displays application notification icons (new voicemail, missed call,
unread e-mail and so on). With a flick, however, the shade unrolls to fill the
screen and provides additional information about your notifications (Figure
5). At a glance, you can see the first sentence of unread e-mail messages,
texts or tweets. You also get details on downloads that have completed,
application updates that are available or Wi-Fi networks in the area.
A simple tap on a notification will take you right to the application.
I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the notification system works
equally well with third-party apps as it does with Google applications.

Google Integration and Search</h2></div></div><p>
Because this is an Android phone, you would expect integration with
Google's various services to be tight, and it is for some services.
For others, it's nonexistent or inconsistent. A single sign-on the
first day I had the DROID gave me Gmail, Google Calendar
and Gtalk at my fingertips without a second thought. Because of this
seamless integration, I was expecting similar ease when visiting Google
Docs and Google Reader via the native browser, but I was disappointed.
I concluded that this was a security measure related to the fact that
the first three are standalone apps, while the last two run in-browser.
Yes, this explanation made sense until the first time I visited Google.com
and discovered that I was signed in by default. The bigger question is,
of course, why native apps for Docs and Reader aren't available.
</p><p>
Like anything from Google, the search functionality is quite good.
The interface is consistent across all apps (even third-party) and uses
predictive text, as well as your search history, to begin presenting
results as soon as you start typing. Voice search performs well,
provided you speak clearly and limit background noise.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x2cccc40"></a>
Multitasking</h2></div></div><p>
The ability to run multiple applications at the same time is another
feature that sets DROID apart from most of the other smartphones on
the market. The classic example of opening a Web page, leaving to check
e-mail and returning to find the page fully loaded works as advertised.
As a more challenging test, I started Google Navigation and had it provide
me turn-by-turn directions for my route. I then started playback of
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Insider podcast. I wasn't sure how DROID would manage
the conflicting audio streams, but it did the sensible thing by allowing
the navigation prompts to interrupt Shawn and Kyle at the required times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x2cccda0"></a>
Apps and Widgets</h2></div></div><p>
The DROID comes pre-installed with a fairly well-rounded collection of
productivity, entertainment and social-media applications. More notable
than the applications that were included, however, were those that
weren't. The three most glaring omissions being a weather application
(or widget), a Twitter application and a file browser. Fortunately, good
third-party solutions exist for all three.
</p><p>
Regarding third-party applications, the Android apps store has convinced
me that more isn't always better. After many hours browsing the store, it
appears as though there is enough variety to cover just about everything
you'd want to do with your phone (and probably a few things you wouldn't).
For me, I've had no trouble finding applications for most of the things I've
wanted to do. The one shortcoming is the availability of applications
for certain popular Web services. This is beginning to change, however,
even in the short time that DROID has been on the market.
</p><p>
In searching the app store, I've come across a couple applications
developed by Google that aren't on the phone by default, but probably
should be included. The first is Listen, a podcast aggregator that
includes the very nice feature of allowing downloads right to the
DROID over 3G or Wi-Fi (although the app warns of the potential for data-overage charges if you use 3G) and even allows you to begin playback
before the download is completed. The second is a client for Voice,
Google's telephony power tool, that is available by invitation only.
Google Voice users know it's a nice way of managing your
voice calling and SMS through one common interface. Once available to
the public, Google Voice definitely should be a standard part of the
Android operating system.
</p><p>
The DROID also comes supplied with a small collection of useful widgets.
The search widget, of course, is included, and it provides fast access to
search. The widget I've found useful is the one for power management.
It includes status indicators and toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS,
sync and screen brightness.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28c8580.0x2cccfb0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The all-around conclusion is that the DROID is a solid phone. Unlike some
of its Android-based predecessors, the hardware finally has the muscle
to implement the platform the way the developers intended. Only time
will tell if the DROID is a serious contender for the smartphone crown,
but if you're a devoted user of Google's cloud services (Gmail, Calendar
and so on), you'd be hard-pressed to find a phone that does a better job of
integrating these services into your daily routine.
