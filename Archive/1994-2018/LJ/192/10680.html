Mongoose provides a Web server that can be embedded in your application, and it consists of a single C source file (and a header file)
that you can compile and link with your application code.
If you need a simple Web server, Mongoose may be the solution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a042a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Web services are all the rage in development circles, but full-featured
application servers like JBoss are terrible overkill for small system
solutions. In many situations, simple RESTful interfaces suffice without the
need for complex containers. Additionally, embedded single file
implementations may be preferred over collections of scripts that rely on
an external interpreter, such as Python or PHP.
</p><p>
Mongoose is an MIT-licensed, embeddable Web server contained within a
single C module library that can be embedded in a program to provide basic
Web services. Its lightweight approach hides the power of a fully threaded
system capable of serving both static and dynamic content over multiple
ports using standard and secure HTTP protocols. It supports CGI and SSI,
access control lists and digest authorization. File transfers are
supported using code from example server implementations.
</p><p>
Along with the embeddable C library, the Mongoose package includes a front
end that turns the module into a full-fledged server capable of serving
files from a user-specified document root. The ready-to-run server
supports all configurable options from the command line as well as from a
text configuration file. Although this configuration provides a method to
bring Mongoose up quickly, Mongoose's power comes from writing custom
front ends to the Mongoose library with callbacks for specific REST-styled
URIs.
</p><p>
In this article, I introduce the Mongoose library API, show how it can be
configured for multiple uses and provide an example implementation that
serves up static pages utilizing digest authentication. This article is
aimed at developers with a knowledge of C programming. Although not required,
familiarity with HTML and CSS also is useful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a045c0"></a>
Structure of a Mongoose-Based Server</h2></div></div><p>
A Mongoose-based server provides a main() function that parses command-line
arguments, initializes the Mongoose library and then spins in a loop
waiting for an exit event. The command-line arguments are server-specific
but typically represent values to be passed to the Mongoose library through
the mg_set_option() function. Mongoose initialization
requires creating an initial Mongoose context, setting library options and
establishing callback functions for authorization, error and URI handling.
The main function then spins forever while the Mongoose master thread
handles incoming connections on the configured network ports. The front-end
code is responsible for handling signals to support shutdown operations,
including notifying the Mongoose library to stop gracefully.
</p><p>
The Mongoose library is threaded and extremely simple to use. The
initial context starts the master thread, which waits for incoming
connections. New connections are queued, and worker threads are started to
handle them. Processing of the connection occurs in the worker thread.
Here, the connection request is analyzed to determine how processing will
proceed. For performance sake, worker threads are started as needed and
remain after a connection closes to process any additional queued incoming
requests without the overhead of starting new threads (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10680f1.large.jpg"><img src="10680f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Green boxes are user functions, and all the rest are implemented in the
Mongoose library.
</p></div></div><p>
In the worker thread, the incoming request is analyzed to determine what
should happen next. Mongoose supports various HTTP requests, such as PUT,
POST and DELETE. However, for simple REST services, the most important
feature Mongoose supports is callbacks for URIs, error handling and
authentication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04930"></a>
Hello, World: Initialization and Callbacks</h2></div></div><p>
Mongoose initialization is handled within a single user-defined function
called from the main() function. This initialization function performs
three mandatory operations: start the Mongoose initial context (mg_start),
set options on that context (mg_set_option) and specify URI callbacks
(mg_set_uri_callback):

<pre     class="programlisting">

void mongooseMgrInit()
{
  struct mg_context *ctx;
  ctx = mg_start();
  mg_set_option(ctx, "ports", port);
  mg_set_uri_callback(ctx, "/*", &amp;uriHandler, NULL);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The Mongoose API documentation is sparse, and the available options are not
obvious. Fortunately, the man page for the default front end documents
command-line options, which in turn map directly to most of the available
options that can be set with mg_set_option(). The -A option to the
default server, used to edit a digest authentication file, is not supported
by the Mongoose library. The default server supports most, but not all,
available Mongoose library options via the command line. The known_options
array in mongoose.c defines the list of options directly supported by the
Mongoose library.
</p><p>
All arguments to mg_set_option() options are character strings. Mongoose
converts them to appropriate formats as needed. For example, the port
number for the ports option must be specified as one or more character
strings separated by commas, with SSL ports identified with the letter s
appended to the port number. Some options can be disabled at compile time.
To disable SSL options, define NO_SSL. To disable CGI options, define
NO_CGI.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04b40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Arguments to mg_set_option() are case-sensitive. For a quick reference of the
Mongoose library options, refer to the command-line options shown in the
Mongoose Manual on the Web site, using the same case, but remove the dash
prefix.
</p></div><p>
Callbacks, set with mg_set_uri_callback(), are functions that handle
specific URI requests. The asterisk is used as a path wild card. In this
simple example, there is a single callback handler that handles all URI
requests starting at the root path for the Web server.
</p><p>
To complete this example of the Mongoose equivalent of the &ldquo;Hello,
World&rdquo;
program, all that is required is a function for printing a page back to the
requesting Web browser:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void uriHandler()
{
  mg_printf(conn,
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
    "Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n"
    "&lt;html&gt;\r\n"
    "&lt;body&gt;\r\n"
    "Hello, World!\r\n"
    "&lt;/body&gt;\r\n"
    "&lt;/html&gt;\r\n"
    );
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The first two lines are HTTP headers. These are not necessarily required
for such a simple example, but if you do include them, remember to include a blank line
between the Content-Type header and the start of the page content.
</p><p>
Two functions in the Mongoose library are used for sending results back to
the browser: mg_printf() and mg_write(). The former provides printf()
semantics for sending data back to the client, and the latter provides no
limits on the amount of data that can be sent. If the server needs to know
that the client closed the connection before all data was returned, or if the
server needs to send more than MAX_REQUEST_SIZE (8Kb) of data, 
mg_write() should be used. Note that the API documentation says the
maximum size for mg_printf() is 16Kb, but the Mongoose library source code
defaults MAX_REQUEST_SIZE to 8Kb. Multiple mg_printf() or mg_write() calls
are possible within a single callback; however, once the callback returns,
the connection is closed by the worker thread.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04f60"></a>
Authentication and Authorization</h2></div></div><p>
In the Web world, <span   class="emphasis"><em>authentication</em></span> refers to validation of an
incoming request as having come from a known entity. All that is required
is that the entity identify itself with tokens kept by the system. In the
case of digest authentication, that means a user name, password and realm. A
realm is a symbolic name allowing the same user name/password to have
different meanings to different areas of a server URI namespace. In
practice, users need remember only the user name/password combination. The
realm is managed by the server. Digest authentication has additional
complexities related to how the server and client communicate, but from the
standpoint of Mongoose users, this is not required knowledge. In summary,
authentication is used to identify a user.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Authorization</em></span> refers to the verification that an authenticated
entity has permission to do what it is attempting to do. Although people
may have a proper login to a server, they may not have permission to view
certain areas of the Web site. Access to specific server functionality is
handled by authorization.
</p><p>
Mongoose provides built-in support for digest
authentication. If
configured, a file containing a user name, password and realm is stored
within reach of the server at runtime. The server checks this file for
authentication based on HTTP Authentication headers from the browser. A
global authentication file can be configured as well as per-URI
authentication files. Mongoose users can generate these files using
Apache's htdigest program. The location of the file is set during Mongoose
initialization using the mg_set_option() function. The realm defaults to
&ldquo;mydomain.com&rdquo; if not specified. Digest authentication is not required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a05278"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. The fully qualified path to the digest authentication file and
associated
realm are set in options, and a callback is specified to perform server-specific
authorization.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#define DOCROOT   "/docs"
#define HTPASSWD  "/.htpasswd"
#define port      "8083"
void mongooseMgrInit()
{
  struct mg_context *ctx;
  char *ptr = NULL;
  char *documentRoot[PATH_MAX];
  char htpath[PATH_MAX];

  ptr = getcwd(NULL, 0);
  memset(documentRoot, 0, PATH_MAX];
  strcpy(documentRoot, ptr);
  documentRoot = strcat(documentRoot, DOCROOT);

  memset(htpath, 0, PATH_MAX);
  strcpy(htpath, documentRoot);
  strcat(htpath, "/.htpasswd");

  ctx = mg_start();
  mg_set_option(ctx, "ports", port);
  mg_set_uri_callback(ctx, "/*", &amp;uriHandler, NULL);

  mg_set_option(ctx, "auth_gpass", htpath);
  mg_set_option(ctx, "auth_realm",
                "mongoose-example.com");
  mg_set_auth_callback(ctx, "/*", &amp;authorize, NULL);
}

</pre></div><p>
The <tt  >auth_gpass</tt> option sets the location of a global
authentication file. This file is used to authenticate requests for any
URI. The argument for this option is the path to the file. To set
authentication for specific URIs, use the <tt  >protect</tt> option.
The argument to this option is a collection of comma-separated
URI=PATH pairs, with URI being relative to the Web server
and containing wild cards, and PATH being a path to the authentication file
to use for that URI. Paths should be fully qualified or relative to the
directory from which the Mongoose-based server is started.
</p><p>
If an authentication option is set for a requested URI, Mongoose will tell
the client browser to open a login dialog. The Mongoose library processes
the login information from the user before passing control to the
appropriate callback, if any. Once the browser user is authenticated, the
only way to log out is to request the authentication again. It turns out
that this form of authentication requires cookies to implement the logout
process and force another login. Alternatively, cookies can be used to
implement a page with HTML forms for the purpose of login and logout
outside the use of digest authentication. If logout or a server-side form
is required for login, digest authentication probably should not be set
with Mongoose options. Digest authentication still can be used manually,
but Mongoose does not expose API functions for this purpose.
</p><p>
Along with authentication, authorization can be implemented using a
callback registered with the mg_set_auth_callback() function. The
registered function is called before each URI callback to allow the server
code to determine whether the incoming request should be authorized to access
the requested URI. If authorization is granted, this function calls
mg_authorize() on the provided mg_connection. If this is not done,
Mongoose assumes authorization is not granted and will not call the
configured callback for the requested URI:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static
void authorize(
       struct mg_connection *conn,
       const struct mg_request_info *ri,
       void *data)
{
    const char  *cookie, *domain;
    cookie = mg_get_header(conn, "Cookie");
    uri = ri-&gt;uri;

    if ( (strcmp(ri-&gt;uri, "/") == 0) ||
         (strncmp(ri-&gt;uri, "/images", 7) == 0)
       )
    {
        mg_authorize(conn);
    }
    else if (strncmp(ri-&gt;uri, "/logout", 7) == 0)
    {
        ... Verify login cookie ...
        ... redirect to front page ...
    }
    else if (cookie != NULL &amp;&amp;
             strstr(cookie, "UUID=") != NULL)
    {
        ... Get value from the cookie, if any ...
        if ( ...cookie okay ... )
            mg_authorize(conn);
        else
            ... redirect to /logout ...
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Note the arguments to the authorize() function. The first argument is the
connection information. The second is a pointer to request information
pulled from the incoming HTTP request. The third argument points to data
provided when the callback was registered with mg_set_auth_callback().
These same arguments are used when URI callback functions are called.
</p><p>
In this example authorization function, any request for the front page or
the images directory within the document root are authorized automatically.
This allows images referenced in CSS, for example, to be retrieved by the
browser without having to be inspected by this function or by having a
registered URI callback for images. If no callback is registered for a URI,
Mongoose attempts to serve the file found at the specified URI
under the document root.
</p><p>
If the URI is the logout page, the login cookie is checked for, and if
found, the user is redirected to the login page where that cookie is
removed. If the cookie is not found, the server can redirect to the
front page anyway or perform some other appropriate action.
</p><p>
The next test looks for a specific cookie, in this case named
&ldquo;UUID&rdquo;. If
this is found and has the correct value, the request is authorized.
Otherwise, the user is redirected to the logout page, which in turn cleans up
the login cookie and presents the login page again.
</p><p>
The mg_request_info structure is defined in mongoose.h and is filled by the
worker thread with information gleaned from the HTTP request. This
includes information such as the request method (POST, PUT, GET and so
forth), a normalized URI, query string, post data and the IP address from
which the request originated. It also includes an array holding the set of
HTTP headers, which is how cookies are retrieved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a05900"></a>
Cookies</h2></div></div><p>
The mg_get_header() function is used to retrieve a named header from the
mg_request_info's mg_header array. Cookies are set in a header before the
start of the document content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  mg_printf(conn,
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
    "Set-Cookie: UUID=MGOOSE;\r\n"
    "Set-Cookie: LOGIN=;\r\n"
    "Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n"
    ...
</pre>
</p><p>
This code would set the UUID cookie and clear the LOGIN cookie on the
browser. Retrieving a particular cookie requires pulling the cookie header
and parsing it for the desired cookie name/value pair:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static
char *getCookieParam(const char *cookie, char *param)
{
    char *start = NULL;
    char *end  = NULL;
    char *value = NULL;
    int length;

    if ( (cookie!=NULL) &amp;&amp;
         ((start=strstr(cookie, param)) != NULL) )
    {
        if ( (end=strstr(start, "; ")) != NULL )
            length = end-start;
        else
            length = strlen(start);
        value = malloc(length+1);
        memset(value, 0, length+1);
        strncpy(value, start, length);
    }
    return value;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This function will retrieve both the name of the cookie and its value, if
any, as NAME=VALUE. The returned character string must be freed by the
caller, however.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a05b68"></a>
Serving Static Files</h2></div></div><p>
When Mongoose encounters a URI without a registered callback, it attempts to
open the specified file and send it back to the client. Static HTML files
can be written and stored in a document root configured with the
<tt  >root</tt> option. To allow retrieving directory listings of
directories under the document root, set the <tt  >dir_list</tt>
option to <tt  >yes</tt>. This option defaults to
<tt  >no</tt>. The directory list setting is a global
configuration,
so either no directory listings are allowed, or all of them can be seen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfe020"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Options that allow yes/no or true/false values are tested against the
case-insensitive string values of &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;,
&ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;ja&rdquo;. Any other value
is interpreted as no or false.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfe390"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Because the dir_list option does not match a true value,
it will disable
directory listings.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
void mongooseMgrInit()
{
  ...
  mg_set_option(ctx, "dir", documentRoot);
  mg_set_option(ctx, "dir_list", "0");
  ...
}
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfe5a0"></a>
Server Logging</h2></div></div><p>
Mongoose provides access and error logging. The files are appended on
restart of the server. Mongoose provides two functions available from the
API that are documented in the Mongoose API page on the Web site:
mg_set_error_callback() and mg_set_log_callback. These callbacks have a
slightly different configuration from URI callbacks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
void mongooseMgrInit()
{
  ...
  mg_set_error_callback(ctx, 404, show404, NULL)
  mg_set_log_callback(ctx, logger)
  ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The error callback sets callbacks for error codes from 0 to 1000. These
map to HTTP error codes, such as 404 when a requested URI does not exist.
When this callback function is called, the function can print a custom error
page. The log callback is called any time the Mongoose server library
wants to log something.
</p><p>
The source code for the sample server implemented using mongoose can be
found at <a href="../listings/192/10680.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue192/10680.tgz</a>.
It includes a single page with an image and CSS.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
The Mongoose Project is stable and in use by a number of developers;
however, the Google forums for it are littered with spam. Don't let this
inconvenience prevent you from utilizing what is a well-designed and
implemented Web server library.
</p><p>
This introduction to Mongoose covers the basics for creating a lightweight
embedded Web server without covering the full breadth of Mongoose features,
such as CGI or SSL. The ease of use of this library should make it plain
that these extended features will require little additional knowledge of
Mongoose and free developers to build custom Web servers.
