Tor&mdash;Anonymity On-line (<a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_self">https://www.torproject.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
We've covered Tor in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> before (see Kyle Rankin's &ldquo;Browse the
Web without a Trace&rdquo;, January 2008), but that was some time ago,
and this subject seems to be more timely with each passing
day. Also, with Tor being at only 0.2.x status, it still qualifies
as software in development, so I'm justified in featuring it
this month.
</p><p>
For those not in the know, Tor stands for The Onion Router, and
its roots go all the way back to the US Naval Research Laboratory,
Tor's original sponsors. It then became an EFF (Electronic Frontier
Foundation) project until 2005, and it now has moved up to being its own
nonprofit research/education organization: the Tor Project.
</p><p>
The essential idea is that your original IP address is masked by passing
it through numerous special routers, designed to avoid keeping records,
until the original source has been lost and the receiving end knows
only about the last Tor box it encounters. To quote Tor's man page:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes and negotiate
a &ldquo;virtual circuit&rdquo; through the network, in which each node knows its
predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the
circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the
downstream node.
</p><p>
Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers (&ldquo;onion
routers&rdquo;). Users bounce their TCP streams&mdash;Web traffic, FTP,
SSH and so on&mdash;around the routers, and recipients, observers and even the routers
themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
However, all that may be a bit headache-inducing, and the Tor Web site
explains things in human terms quite nicely:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a
form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy,
confidential business activities and relationships, and state security
known as traffic analysis.
</p><p>
Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed
network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents
somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites
you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your
physical location. Tor works with many of your existing applications,
including Web browsers, instant-messaging clients, remote login and
other applications based on the TCP protocol.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10705f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Tor takes a clever approach to anonymity, deliberately losing IP
addresses as it bounces from server to server.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10705f2.large.jpg"><img src="10705f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Tor can be a bit hard to understand at first, but if you 
look around, many tools can help you along the way,
such as TorK and even custom distributions built around using Tor.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Installation and Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Surprisingly, there aren't many strange library requirements for Tor;
it may install straightaway on many systems. The only missing library
that got in the way was libevent, and installing libevent-dev (which
selects the other needed libevent libraries along with it at the time)
sorted this out. However, Tor recommends using the program Polipo,
but I'll get to that in a moment.
</p><p>
To install Tor, head to the download page where source and binaries are
available. You can figure out the binaries yourself, but for those
using source, grab the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal
in the new folder. Enter the usual commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro doesn't:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To set up Tor for Web browsing, at this point, you have to install
Polipo. This is in most distros' repositories, so you can decide
how you want to install Polipo yourself. I'll quote Tor's documentation
from here:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Polipo is a caching Web proxy that does http pipelining well, so it's
well suited for Tor's latencies. Make sure to get at least Polipo 1.0.4,
since earlier versions lack the SOCKS support required to use Polipo
with Tor.
</p><p>
Once you've installed Polipo (either from package or from source), you
will need to configure Polipo to use Tor. Grab our Polipo configuration
for Tor and put it in place of your current polipo config file
(for example, /etc/polipo/config or ~/.polipo). You'll need to restart Polipo
for the changes to take effect. For example: <tt  >/etc/init.d/polipo
restart</tt>.
</p><p>
If you prefer, you can instead use Privoxy with this sample Privoxy
configuration. But, since the config files both use port 8118, you
shouldn't run both Polipo and Privoxy at the same time.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Configure Your Applications to Use Tor</em></span>
</p><p>
After installing Tor and Polipo, you need to configure your applications
to use them. The first step is to set up Web browsing.
</p><p>
You should use Tor with Firefox and Torbutton for
the best safety. Simply
install the Torbutton plugin, restart Firefox, and you're
all set (the Torbutton plugin for Firefox is available at
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275" target="_self">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275</a>). 
</p><p>
To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just point them
at Polipo (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS directly (for
instant messaging, Jabber, IRC and so on), you can point your application
directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see the FAQ entry for why
this may be dangerous. For applications that support neither SOCKS nor
HTTP, take a look at tsocks or socat.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It's really hard to do justice to Tor in this small space, so I hope
I've at least pointed you in a useful direction and haven't
made any glaring errors. It really is worth heading to the Web site to
understand it more fully. Speaking of the Web site, here's an appeal
from the Tor folks themselves:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Tor's security improves as its user base grows and as more people
volunteer to run relays. (It isn't nearly as hard to set up as you might
think and can significantly enhance your own security.) If running a
relay isn't for you, we need help with many other aspects of the project,
and we need funds to continue making the Tor network faster and easier
to use while maintaining good security.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Information is becoming increasingly unsafe, and certain
governments and corporations are becoming increasingly invasive
regarding personal data. It's time that Net users started taking
more care with their information, and Tor is an interesting technology
that I'm sure will continue to become more relevant over time.

audiopreview&mdash;Multimedia Previewer
(<a href="http://audiopreview.codealpha.net" target="_self">audiopreview.codealpha.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I love niche programs, especially in the area of multimedia. If
you're like me, you probably have a folder full of MP3s and Oggs
collected from the last ten years that's reached the point where you've
forgotten half the files in there. This month, I stumbled upon
the charming little command-line program, audiopreview. To quote the
project's Freshmeat entry:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
audiopreview is a command-line tool that plays previews of many audio
file types (Ogg, MP3, etc.), video file types (AVI, MPEG, Real, etc.),
and Internet streams. It also can be used as a regular command-line media
file player (that is, play the files entirely like yauap or mpc123 would).
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10705f3.large.jpg"><img src="10705f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
audiopreview is a simple and easy command-line program for previewing large
numbers of music files.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10705f4.large.jpg"><img src="10705f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Although the name may suggest otherwise, audiopreview also plays video
files.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Packages for audiopreview are available in Debian/Ubuntu format or the
usual source. If you're running with the source, according to the man
page, you need the following libraries: gstreamer0.10-plugins-base,
gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly.
</p><p>
I found I also had to install the intltool library to get past the
configure script. Once you have the library side of things sorted out,
compile the program with the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro doesn't:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Using the actual command can be as simple as entering the folder where the
files you
want to hear are located and entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ audiopreview *
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6d580.0x205f128"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(The * is used to indicate all the files in a folder.)
</p><p>
Once the program is running, you'll be greeted with a simple track
listing, along with other relevant information in purple. As far as controls
go, the spacebar pauses and unpauses the stream, N plays the next stream,
and P plays the previous stream. R restarts the current stream,
and Q stops playing and exits the program.
</p><p>
That's the basic usage out of the way, but let's refine it with some
command-line switches to hone your usage. For new Linux users,
these are added at the end of the command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ audiopreview files-to-play --switch
</pre>
</p><p>
If you plan on using audiopreview to play a whole song instead
of in segments, use the switch
<tt  >--entirely</tt> or <tt  >-e</tt>.
</p><p>
If you want audiopreview to start over again after the last song has been
played, use
<tt  >--loop</tt> or <tt  >-l</tt>.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, audiopreview also can play some video
formats. However, this being a command-line program, there's a good
chance you may not have X running. If so, you'll
want to disable the video to avoid errors. To do so, enter
<tt  >--no-video</tt>.
</p><p>
The default starting position for each file seems to be random, which
might become annoying for those looking for more specific sections of a
song. Thankfully, you can specify which section of a song you want to
hear with a simple numerical switch. Add:
<tt  >--position=POSITION</tt> or <tt  >-p
POSITION</tt>,
and replace POSITION with the numbers 0, 1, 2 or 3. 0 sets the
position to the beginning, 1 to the middle, 2 to the end, and 3 makes
the start position random.
</p><p>
Last but not least, engage the all-important shuffle function with
<tt  >--shuffle</tt> or <tt  >-S</tt>.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ audiopreview *.mp3 -p 1 --shuffle
</pre>
</p><p>
The above command plays all the MP3 files in a directory, sets the starting position
to the middle of a song and shuffles the order in which they're played.
</p><p>
You can work out the rest from here, but honestly, do yourself a
favor and check out the man page with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ man audiopreview
</pre>
</p><p>
Ultimately, audiopreview fills a nice little niche that will appeal
to anyone sorting through large collections of music (and some video)
files. DJs in particular will find this of real use, but I found
it great for rediscovering songs I hadn't listened to in years. Love it.

I'm dying to cover this project, but installing it is proving to be a
pain! It sounds great though: &ldquo;LiarLiar is a voice-stress analysis tool
for Linux. Voice-stress analysis, an alternative to the polygraph as a
method for lie detection, is already widely used in police and insurance
fraud investigations. LiarLiar's main purpose is to detect stress in a
person's voice. Higher stress levels can be an indication that the person
is not being truthful.&rdquo; I'm having problems with library requirements,
and I can't reach the developers. If anyone out there can help 
get this working, please send me an e-mail!

I ran out of space this month, but I hope to cover this next time. Any
creative writers should check this project out. &ldquo;Storybook is a free
(open-source) novel-writing tool for creative writers, novelists and
authors which will help you to keep an overview of multiple plot lines

the information about your characters and locations in one place, as
well as manage chapters, scenes, characters and locations.
