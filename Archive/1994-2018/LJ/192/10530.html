With the rise of Web 2.0 and Rich Internet Applications, the need for 
a solid JavaScript-based data management paradigm has become much more
acute. Using jsormdb, you can develop your applications with the
same data-driven paradigm you use on server-side applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2af62a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The (almost) standardization and acceptance of JavaScript as a
browser-side development language has enabled the rapid growth of
dynamic Web applications. These applications often look and feel as
snappy as native desktop applications. Add the excellent open-source
client-side development frameworks, like jQuery and ExtJS, along with
the communicative power of AJAX, and you have an incredibly powerful
and largely open browser-side development platform. 
</p><p>
It has gotten
so powerful, in fact, that applications are
living entirely within the browser, with the server acting as a simple
file store. One excellent example is password managers, like Clipperz
and jkPassword. These work entirely in the browser to provide the user
interface and encryption. The only services provided by the server are
serving the static HTML and JavaScript files, and persisting the already-browser-side-encrypted file.
</p><p>
As the client side grows, and self-contained applications like these
password managers increase, the need for basic services that are normally
available in a development environment increase. In a normal development
environment, the ability to manage data reliably is one of the first
and key issues tackled. Sometimes, it leads to full-blown client-server
database systems, like Oracle or MySQL. In other instances, it leads
to embedded databases&mdash;for example, Apache Derby, which are critical for
managing data within a single instance of an application.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, our browser development platform has lacked any such
data management system. As it turns out, the availability of such a
system is even more critical in the browser environment than in a server
environment. For complete browser applications,
the entire data set and transaction semantics are local and cannot
depend on a server. For more traditional server-driven applications,
the need is even more acute. Whereas a server can rely on redundancy,
high bandwidth and low latency to its data store, the browser has
none of these attributes. It becomes critically important for the
browser application developer to be able to perform the majority of the
application's data activities locally, sending the result to the server
with the lowest frequency and bandwidth possible.
</p><p>
Enter a new class of data stores, embedded JavaScript databases.
This article introduces jsormdb, an advanced JavaScript database
engine. jsormdb includes most of the features you, as a developer,
would expect in an embedded database system, as well as many that make
sense only within the context of a browser environment. I describe
jsormdb and its basic usage, including creating a database, loading
data, modifying and querying the data, and transactions. jsormdb also
supports event signaling and, critical for a browser-side data store,
persisting changes or the entire data set to the server, but those are the
subject of another article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2af6618"></a>
Why a Database?</h2></div></div><p>
As anyone who has done even a moderate amount of development knows,
data storage structures are, in many ways, the fundamental building
block of any application. There are several good reasons for this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Performance: choice of data structure can have a significant impact
on application performance. For example, using a linked list versus a
serial array is slower to access elements in the middle of the list,
but much faster at list reorder and element insertion/addition/removal.
</p></li><li><p>
Usability: a standard data structure makes it much easier for someone
else (or you) to understand what your application does and how.
</p></li><li><p>
Separation of concerns: by separating data structure and storage from
business logic, you are able to work with each separately.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
A good database structure addresses those concerns, while providing
the following features:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Queries: you will want to query your data to discover which elements of the
data&mdash;for example the first, 35th and 60th records&mdash;match certain
arbitrary criteria. Of course, big RDBMS systems excel at this, and
even have their own language for doing so, SQL. Of course you're not about to
embed Oracle or MySQL type systems into a JavaScript environment,
just to support local temporary queries.
</p></li><li><p>
Indexing: if you go to an arbitrary array or table of data and ask
it to return all the records where the third field is equal to 2, you
(or your data store engine) will need to go to each and every record and
check whether the third field is equal to 2. This is called a full table scan,
and it is terribly inefficient. For fields that are checked frequently,
you would much prefer a more efficient method, one that does not
require checking every single record linearly. This is known as indexing.
</p></li><li><p>
Transactions: in a simple world, events are single-stage and
one-way. For example, login is a simple process: you enter your credentials
and are either in or out. In the real world, however, events usually
are multistage. For example, in order to transfer $100 from your checking
account to your savings account, you need to deduct $100 from your
checking account <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> add $100 to your savings account. Ideally, both
steps will succeed. If both fail, it is not great, but you can live with
it. However, if only one of the two succeeds, either you (if it is the
deduction) or your bank (if it is the addition) will be very unhappy.
</p></li><li><p>
Events: sometimes, you want the database to tell you whether something
of significance has occurred. For example, you may want to know that
a certain table has been updated or perhaps that an account balance has
dropped below a certain threshold. Many databases support events, often
known as triggers, that cause reactions.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Because I am discussing the browser environment, one additional feature
is important: persistence. A browser environment is a transient one; the moment 
users close their windows, all of the data is lost. Because the browser
application relies on the server to provide permanence, you want
a way to handle both loading your local data store from,
as well as persisting our local changes back to, that server seamlessly.
</p><p>
jsormdb provides a solution to all of these problems. When configured
correctly, the presentation and business logic within your application
can treat jsormdb as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> data store, leaving jsormdb to handle
persistence to/from the server.
Without jsormdb, your application looks like Figure 1.

With jsormdb, you can work with a much cleaner design (Figure 2).

How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
The jsormdb library introduces several concepts and implementations that
are necessary for creating and using a database. Note that all of these
are detailed in the JavaScriptDoc distributed with jsormdb, in the doc
folder.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The database: this class is JSORM.db.db(), and it represents a single
database instance.
</p></li><li><p>
The parser: responsible for taking input data
and transforming it into records that are stored in an instance of
JSORM.db.db or taking entries in a jsormdb database and transforming
them into an acceptable output format. For example, the data you load
into the library may be in JSON, XML, JavaScript objects or even Pig
Latin. jsormdb does not care, provided you provide a parser that
can convert between your preferred encoding and an array of native
JavaScript objects. jsormdb comes with a parser for JSON and Objects;
an XML parser is being developed.
</p></li><li><p>
The channel: responsible for loading data from or
saving data to a remote data store. An HTTP channel can use AJAX
to retrieve data from and post data to the server from which the Web page itself was
loaded. You also can use another jsormdb as a source for your database,
but a channel for that is unnecessary.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Putting it all together, you can create a database instance JSORM.db.db
that retrieves data via HTTP from your server using JSORM.db.channel.http
and parses it in JSON format using JSORM.db.parser.json. Figure 3 shows
how all the pieces work together.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10530f3.large.jpg"><img src="10530f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Fetching and Parsing Data from the Server
</p></div></div><p>
It is important to note that all classes follow Douglas Crockford's
principles and are instantiated directly, without the &ldquo;new&rdquo;
keyword:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var parser = JSORM.db.parser.json();     // right
var parser = new JSORM.db.parser.json(); // WRONG!
</pre>
</p><p>
As much as possible, jsormdb semantics follow those of classical
SQL. Thus, adding records is an insert; modifying records is an update, and
so forth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2af7900"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing jsormdb involves a few simple steps.
</p><p>
1) Download and unzip the library from the jsorm site, where it is
available as a zip file from the Download link.
</p><p>
2) Install the library.
The download includes two versions of the library. jsormdb.js is
minified at just under 25KB. jsormdb-src.js is not minified, is used
primarily for debugging and is 77KB. You can reduce their
sizes further with gzip. You need to install the library you want to use
in a path accessible to your browsers. For the purposes of this example,
install file jsormdb.js in the same directory as your Web page.
</p><p>
3) Include the library in your Web page.
Normally this is done in the header as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jsormdb.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2af7bc0"></a>
Creation</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have downloaded and installed the library, as well as included
it in your page, you are ready to create a database.
</p><p>
In the simplest form, you create a database by simply instantiating it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var db = JSORM.db.db();
</pre>
</p><p>
Although this creates a database, you may want to add some initial
configuration parameters. For example, you may want to indicate the parser
and/or the channel to use, or even to load some data directly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2ef0020"></a>
Loading Data</h2></div></div><p>
jsormdb supports loading data in two ways: directly, using raw data,
and remotely, via a channel:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var conf, db;
// to use a channel and parser
conf = {
    channel: JSORM.db.channel.http({updateUrl: "/send/text.php",
                                    loadUrl:   "/receive/text.json"}),
    parser:  JSORM.db.parser.json()
}
db = JSORM.db.db(conf);

// to load data directly
conf = {data: [{name: "Joe",   age: 25},
               {name: "Jill",  age: 30},
               {name: "James", age: 35}]}
db = JSORM.db.db(conf);
</pre>
</p><p>
JSORM.db.db has many options for instantiation.
See the API docs or the Wiki entry, both of which are listed in the
Resources for this article.
</p><p>
Whichever manner you choose to load data, jsormdb expects the data passed
to it to be an array of simple JavaScript object literals. jsormdb is
not rigid about the data structure, and it does not care what fields exist
on each object. Both of the following are equally valid:

<pre     class="programlisting">
data = [{name: "Joe",   age: 25},
        {name: "Jill",  age: 30},
        {name: "James", age: 35}];

data = [{name:      "Joe",   age:  25},
        {firstName: "Jill"},
        {surname:   "James", city: "London"}];
</pre>
</p><p>
An important note about the records is that each can have a type. When a
record has a type, it is specially marked and can be searched more easily
along with others of the same type. This can improve search times greatly,
akin to putting records in different tables in an RDBMS:


<pre     class="programlisting">
data = [
	{name: "Joe",     age: 25,         type:   "person"},
	{name: "Jill",    age: 30,         type:   "person"},
	{name: "James",   age: 35,         type:   "person"},
	{name: "Fiat",    color: "yellow", type:   "car"},
	{name: "Ferrari", color: "red",    type:   "car"},
	{name: "GM",      color: "white",  type:   "car",
	                                   status: "bankrupt"}
	];
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2ef0440"></a>
Querying Data</h2></div></div><p>
In order to make the database useful, you need to be able to retrieve
records you inserted or loaded&mdash;that is, you need to query the database. To
do this, you simply call db.find(query). The results will be an array
of JavaScript objects that match your query. If no records match, an
empty array is returned. If the query itself is
invalid, a null object is returned.
</p><p>
The query parameter itself is an object with two fields:
&ldquo;where&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fields&rdquo;. The where field informs the database what you need to
match in order to retrieve the record. It can be a simple match, or it
can be a compound match, joining multiple simple or compound matches
into a single larger one. The fields field can be used to restrict
which fields are returned from the records that are found:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var where, results;

// simple, retrieves all records where the name field equals "John"
where  = {field: "name", compares: "equals", value: "John"};
results = db.find({where: where});

// compound, retrieves all records where name equals "John"
// or name equals "Jack"
where = {join: 'or',
         terms: [
                {field: "name", compares: "equals", value: "John"},
                {field: "name", compares: "equals", value: "Jack"}]};
results = db.find({where: where});
</pre>
</p><p>
Compound terms can be joined by <tt  >'and'</tt> or
<tt  >'or'</tt>. Simple terms can match on
any field and can compare the field using one of many conditions,
such as &ldquo;equals&rdquo;, &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;starts&rdquo;,
&ldquo;gt&rdquo; and so on. The API docs and Wiki
entry, listed in the Resources for this article,
have a complete list.
</p><p>
Finally, you can restrict the search, at any level, by the type of
record to retrieve. The type field, if available, is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> indexed,
leading to much faster searches:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// all records of type "car" where age &gt;= 12
where   = {field: "age", compares: "ge", value: 12, type: "car"};
results = db.find({where: where});
</pre>
</p><p>
It is important to note that the results of a db.find(query) will return
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>copy</em></span> of the records, not the originals themselves.
Thus, it is
safe to modify the returned results at will.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2ef0b78"></a>
Modifying Data</h2></div></div><p>
You can modify data in one of several ways: remove records, add records
or change records.
</p><p>
Adding records is fairly straightforward. Simply call db.insert(data),
with the data an array of JavaScript object literals:

<pre     class="programlisting">
data = [{name: "Jack",  age:  80},
        {name: "Sam",   age:  22},
        {city: "Paris", type: "location"}]
db.insert(data);
</pre>
</p><p>
Where these records actually will physically be inserted into the jsormdb
database is irrelevant, just as it is in any true database. All that
matters is that the records are inserted, and that you can retrieve them.
</p><p>
To remove records, just call db.remove(query). The query parameter is
exactly the same as in db.find(). All records that match the where will
be removed immediately.
</p><p>
To change records, just call db.update(data,query). The query parameter
is exactly the same as in db.find(). The data parameter is a single
JavaScript object that has the fields to update. All records whose fields
match the where will be updated:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// for every record where the age &gt;= 40, change the age to be 35
var update, where;
where  = {field: "age", compares: "ge", age: 40};
update = {age: 35};
db.update(update,where);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fe580.0x2ef0ee8"></a>
Transactions</h2></div></div><p>
As noted earlier, transactions are crucial to anything other than
trivial events. jsormdb provides advanced transaction processing to
allow you to manage your changes properly.
</p><p>
Transactions are always enabled. From the moment you load a database,
a new transaction is started. All the changes you make&mdash;update, remove,
insert&mdash;are tracked by jsormdb. When you have reached the end of your
transaction, you must either commit the changes or reject them.
</p><p>
If you commit the changes, all of the change tracking is thrown away, and
a new transaction is started. From that point forward, you cannot undo any
of your previous changes. On the other hand, if you reject the changes,
all of the changes from the beginning of the transaction&mdash;either the
last load or the last commit or reject&mdash;are undone. Additionally,
if you want, you can reject only <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> of your changes. For example,
if you have made eight changes in this transaction, and you want to
undo only the last four, you can do so. This is particularly useful in the
user-interface environment. For example, if you have written a Web 2.0
spreadsheet application with jsormdb as your data store, you probably
want to give users the ability to undo each of their changes, one by one,
in reverse order, probably using Ctrl-Z on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Z on
Mac. Until jsormdb, you would have to code the tracking of these changes
manually. Now, you can simply delegate this function to
jsormdb. Each time users click Undo, they reject exactly one change.
</p><p>
The following example starts with three records, adds two more,
modifies one and removes one:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var data, where, db, recs;

// create and load the database
data = [{name: "Joe",   age: 25},
        {name: "Jill",  age: 30},
        {name: "James", age: 35}];
db = JSORM.db.db({data: data});

// add records
db.insert([{name: "Karl", age: 40}, {name: "Karyn"}]);

// modify Joe
db.update({data:  {age: 26},
           where:
               {field: "name", compares: "equals", value: "Joe"}});

// remove James
db.remove({where:
               {field: "name", compares: "equals", value: "James"}});

// get all of the data
recs = db.find();
// recs = [{name: "Joe",   age: 26},
//         {name: "Jill",  age: 30},
//         {name: "Karl",  age: 40},
//         {name: "Karyn"}]

// we can commit, reject or partially reject
db.commit();  // all changes are saved and a new transaction starts
// OR
db.reject();  // all changes are rolled back;
              // db.find() returns [{name: "Joe",   age: 25},
              //                    {name: "Jill",  age: 30},
              //                    {name: "James", age: 35}]
// OR
db.reject(1); // just the removal of James is rolled back
</pre>
</p><p>
Last but not least, commit() can cause jsormdb to update the server with
its new data in one of several formats, and it even can update itself based
on the server's response. This persistence of changes, which uses
jsormdb to mediate between browser-side business logic and presentation
on the one hand and server-side storage on the other, is the subject of
another article.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
In summary, jsormdb provides Web browser application developers the
ability to isolate data management from business and
presentation logic cleanly, to utilize full transaction semantics easily
and to query, update and modify data, including indexing, simply and
efficiently.
