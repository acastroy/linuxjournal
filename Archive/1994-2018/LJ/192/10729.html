AdaCore's CodePeer</h2></div></div><p>
Make your Ada code live up to the language's elegant name with AdaCore's
new CodePeer, a source code analysis tool that detects runtime and
logic errors in Ada programs. As a code reviewer, CodePeer identifies
constructs that are likely to lead to runtime errors, such as buffer
overflows, and flags legal but suspect code typical of logic errors.
Additionally, AdaCore says that its tool goes &ldquo;beyond the
capabilities of typical static analysis tools&rdquo;, producing a detailed
analysis of each subprogram, including pre- and postconditions, which
allows for early detection of potential bugs and vulnerabilities.
CodePeer can be used both during system development or as part of a
systematic code review process. Finally, it can be used either as a
standalone tool or fully integrated into the GNAT Pro Ada development
environment.

SoleraTec's Phoenix RSM</h2></div></div><p>
Keep the burglars at bay with SoleraTec's new and improved Phoenix RSM,
an overarching forensic video surveillance management system. The RSM
part stands for Phoenix's Record, Store and Manage capabilities.

environments; incrementally scalable three-medium (hard disk, digital
computer tape and optical) on-line and off-line multitier storage; and
unlimited retention and support for an unlimited number of cameras,
servers and users. Furthermore, video from all connected cameras can
be reviewed, investigated and exported with client tools that run on
Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Features added to the new version include
one-step centralized camera configuration, simplified camera policy
management and support for QuickTime and VLC media players.

Libelium's Waspmote</h2></div></div><p>
Waspmote from Libelium is a modular platform for wireless sensor networks
that enables environmental monitoring in adverse conditions and remote
locations with its radio range of up to 40km. The sensors are intended
for deployment in fire and flood detection and other environmental
monitoring applications. Waspmote networks can communicate to the
external world via GPRS or in situations with very difficult wireless
connectivity, such as mines. Each sensor device can store more than 21 million
different sensor measurements in its internal memory. Waspmote's four
power modes&mdash;on, sleep, deep sleep and hibernation&mdash;enable a device
to function for up to three years without recharging the battery, while a small
solar panel can allow it to run indefinitely. Special boards that
enable detection of gases and physical events (such as pressure, impact,
vibration, temperature and so on) can be integrated. Open-source API and
programming environment are available.

Bart Kummel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache MyFaces 1.2 Web Application
Development</em></span>
(Packt)</h2></div></div><p>
The folks at Packt Publishing recently released Bart Kummel's new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache MyFaces 1.2 Web Application Development</em></span>, a work that teaches
readers how to build appealing Web interfaces with the open-source Apache
MyFaces framework. Written as a step-by-step, example-driven tutorial,
Kummel's book teaches concepts such as assuring re-usability of code,
building consistent-looking and usable pages with Trinidad components,
applying advanced components from the Tomahawk library, enabling
AJAX functionality without writing JavaScript code, creating dynamic
applications that utilize Trinidad's skinning capabilities and preventing
the duplication of validation rules. The book also contains scores of
tips and tricks based on experience with MyFaces in real-life projects.

Active Media Products' 600X Pro Series CompactFlash Cards</h2></div></div><p>
The geeks at Active Media Products weren't satisfied with the performance
of CompactFlash cards in digital photography applications, so they
made their own. The company's 600X Pro line of CF cards, which write
up to 90MB per second, aims to free the memory card's hitherto role
as bottleneck in shooting action sequences with DSLRs firing up to 10
frames per second. Active Media also says that the cards support
0&ndash;70&deg;C operating temperatures and are rugged and reliable enough to take
into the field. Capacities range from 8GB to 64GB.

Cyberoam iView Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
Cyberoarm iView, an open-source logging and reporting solution, has
recently become available in a convenient appliance form. The product
caters to the logging/reporting requirements of SMBs and distributed
enterprises, delivering a comprehensive view of network activity across
dispersed geographical locations. Cyberoam describes the iView appliances
as quick-to-deploy and easy-to-manage preloaded hardware devices with
terabyte-storage space, RAID technology, redundancy and high levels of

gain complete visibility into network activity with real-time security
and access reports related to top virus attacks, spam recipients, Web
users and more, reinforcing organization-wide network security and data
confidentiality. It also offers archiving to meet forensic requirements.

Perforce's Software Configuration Management System</h2></div></div><p>
Perforce came out swinging in the new year, announcing a new version
2009.2 of its Software Configuration Management (SCM) System. SCM is
a tool that versions and manages source code and digital assets for
enterprises of all sizes. The most significant addition to 2009.2 is
shelving&mdash;that is, real-time metadata replication and additional functionality
for working off-line. This feature enables developers to cache modified
files in the Perforce Server without first having to check them in as
a versioned change. Users, thus, can pass pending changes to managers as
part of code review or approval workflows, share works in progress with
another team member or workstation, test changes in a distributed build
environment, and put aside an effort when a higher priority task arrives.
