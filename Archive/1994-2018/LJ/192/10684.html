Error in Distance Calculation</h4><p>
The distance calculation in Dave Taylor's December 2009 Work the Shell is
in error because he's not using enough
significant digits. Six digits usually are not sufficient to define
the position of a place or object accurately in lat/lon coordinates. In my
experience, it
typically takes nine digits to get sub-meter accuracy.

National Debt = 1,587 Miles</h4><p>
I like your National Debt figure tally, which used to appear in
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Index. It is a healthy reminder of
the country's economic burden. However, it is difficult to grasp how much
money it is. Here is my favorite method to &ldquo;get it&rdquo;. A $100 bill is
approximately 0.1mm thick. So in a cm, you have 100 bills = $10,000. In a
meter, you can stack a million dollars, or 1.6 billion dollars in a mile. So
a National Debt of 2.54 trillion dollars is a stack of 1,587 miles of $100
bills! If you split it in two and put it on a road, you will have almost
800 miles of $100 bills. If you drive your car on it, you will run out
of gas before reaching the end!

Cloud Computing</h4><p>
I devoured Mick Bauer's Paranoid Penguin column &ldquo;Linux Security Challenges
2010&rdquo; in the January 2010 issue. How I wish the people where I work had
one-tenth of his insightful common-sense view! But, I think one challenge
is missing, user education. Although the IT department must bear the ultimate
responsibility for security, I think end users should be held accountable.
Computer basics should be on the hiring criteria for any position that
requires the use of a computer, and basic training should be compulsory for
new hires, as should annual &ldquo;what's new&rdquo; sessions. My company offers free
training in just about everything except computer know-how, and it
considers including its computer/e-mail policy statement in the new-hire
packet satisfactory. As a result, many users don't know what copy/paste
does, but they use company laptops for everything from on-line shopping to
browsing porn sites. They have no motivation to change, because their
behavior has no consequences. But if doing something stupid costs
properly trained employees bonus points, they might think twice before
clicking.

Linux and DRM</h4><p>
If you ask me why I keep a Windows desktop, the answer is
still three letters, DRM. I have two desktops: my Ubuntu 9.10 (which is very good
and does just about everything) and my W7 desktop (which does everything with
DRM). Even with the CrossOver Office Plugin, I can't run Amazon Unbox,
which allows me to watch my favorite TV shows over and over.
</p><p>
I have been a Linux user since RH 6.2, and I love the way things have
come along. There have been few DRM issues, but again, until we make some
kind of headway with all the major distributors, I will have to keep a
Windoze desktop of some kind. I now run W7. It's half the bloated warthog
of its predecessor, but it's still not my beloved GNOME desktop. (Yes, I really
love GNOME.)
</p><p>
The day I can run the Amazon Unbox client, or the day Amazon ports Unbox
over to Linux (and, of course, somebody works out a deal with Netflix) is the
day I give up this machine of great power (Intel i7) and make it my new,
true desktop. 
</p><p>
My Linux desktop is highly functional and a
flawless media server and print server for the house. Now, if we could only
get the major streaming media people to help us out. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark Kaufman  <br><br>
</p><p>
I know <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> what you mean. Linux itself is quite
functional; it's just all the services from others that are causing the
problem. I have the same issue with DRM, and while I try diligently
to avoid it, there are times when I'm forced into such things. Netflix, for
example, runs great on the Linux-based Roku device, but for those
of us with Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>desktops</em></span>, we can't watch streaming
video! So, yes,
I feel your pain.&mdash;Ed.

Google Chrome, Linux and Web Applications</h4><p>
Recently, I decided to download Google Chrome for Ubuntu after the almost
stealthy release last month. I was blown away by the many great features
and other hoopla we've been eagerly awaiting. One surprise feature, which
is of extreme interest to myself as a Web developer, is that Google Chrome
has an App Mode where it runs a Web site in its own application window,
&agrave;
la Mozilla's Prism.
</p><p>
There's one problem though. The .desktop files it creates to do so are garbage
and won't install into /usr/share/applications without hacking permissions
on the folder, which will lead to constant messages indicating the change
in permissions when applications are installed/updated. So, not to be
defeated by such a simple problem, I came up with what I'd like to think is
an elegant solution&mdash;a Python app I call chromify.
</p><p>
It's a simple application that makes up for Google Chrome's shortcoming in
creating clean .desktop files. For now, it's just a CLI program, but it's
still very feature-rich and uses a Python module so that other interfaces
can be used/developed (that is, CGI or a GUI) to create Google Chrome
Web apps.
</p><p>
Downloads, installation guides and a wiki are available at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromify" target="_self">code.google.com/p/chromify</a>.
</p><p>
Note: I'm not trying to advertise here. This was something of an
extreme annoyance for me, and I know it likely is for others. This is more
of an &ldquo;I thought I'd share&rdquo; letter than anything else. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
G. John Schutte  <br><br>
</p><p>
Whoa, that's awesome. Prism with Firefox has been rather wonky
of late. I do like Chrome's App Mode, and although I haven't had a chance
to play with it enough to discover the issues with its .desktop files,
it sounds like it's pretty annoying! Thanks for not only fixing the
problem, but also for sharing your solution. Hooray for open source!&mdash;Ed.

OpenVPN</h4><p>
I loved Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Linux VPNs with OpenVPN&rdquo; article in the
February 2010 issue, and I think it is long overdue. OpenVPN is a great
technology.
I'm just wondering if Mick meant VPN where VLAN is listed on page 28, as
these are two completely
different types of network technology.
This also brings up a good idea&mdash;any chance on doing an article describing
how to configure Linux for use with VLANs?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Aaron   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> 
You're quite right, both instances of the term VLAN in this article (in the same
paragraph) were misprints; I meant to say VPN. I hope this didn't cause too much
confusion!
</p><p>
You're also right that VLANs (Virtual LANs) would make a good topic.
Actually, Paul Frieden covered VLANs in 2004 on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
Web site, in his article &ldquo;VLANs
on Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7268" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7268</a>), including its
use with iptables. But,
I've been thinking of covering this topic myself in the context of a larger
article on building Linux broadband routers using OpenWRT&mdash;stay tuned for the
(probable) upcoming series.
Thanks both for the correction and the suggestion!

Comparing Files</h4><p>
Joey Bernard's review of diff and its relatives on page 16 of the February
2010 issue
was useful, but he didn't mention sdiff, which is the basis of my favorite
way of comparing two text files.
</p><p>
The problem with <tt  >diff -y</tt> is that the side-by-side format isn't very
convenient. I prefer to use the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sdiff -s -w156 file1 file2 | more
</pre>
</p><p>
This places the lines of file1 above those of file2, if they differ. Small
differences really stand out in this format.
The <tt  >-w 156</tt> makes corresponding columns line up in an 80-column text
window.

Clarification</h4><p>
Thanks for the wonderful article &ldquo;Running Remote Applications&rdquo;
by Michael J. Hammel in the February 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
In the article, it says &ldquo;Because VNC is based on the tile architecture, where
rectangles of frame buffer memory are resent if they have been updated,
any compression that improves the transfer of tiles will have serious
performance implications.&rdquo; I am confused. Are you saying that if tile
compression of the frame buffer segments is implemented that the
performance would be worse as opposed to non-tile compression? One
would think that frame buffer compression would improve bandwidth usage
but may, in fact, increase latency&mdash;what do you think?
</p><p>
By the way, it would be great if a follow-up article could be done on remote
multimedia in concert with remote desktop&mdash;I was thinking about UPNP AV
and DLNA.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Daya Cooppan  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael J. Hammel replies:</b></span> I'm not completely sure about this. I think this is information I found
during my research and not in my experimentation, but I thought it worthwhile to include in the article.
Compression, in general, should increase latency while reducing
bandwidth. However, my interpretation of my own writing is that the
client side potentially sees tile compression from the server as raw
pixel changes and, therefore, asks for all tiles repeatedly. If this is
true, compression potentially increases bandwidth by resending more
tiles than what was actually updated.
I'm not sure this is actually the case, however. My recent use of VNC
using virt-viewer and friends doesn't seem to show this, although I can't
verify (at the moment) if compression is being used.
In essence, I can't find my notes that say where this came from. At
best, it is accurate based on specific implementations. My apologies
for not being able to back it up further.
</p><p>
As far as a follow-up article on 
UPNP AV
and DLNA, I'm not familiar with either at the moment, but I'll certainly look into
them. I love to find new technologies to play with, and if I can speak
intelligently about them, I'll certainly propose it to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> (if I can just
remember to hang onto my research notes&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>sigh</em></span>). I believe Red Hat's
recent announcement on SPICE is related to this problem space, and I'm
planning on investigating that as well.
Thanks for the feedback!

Linux on the Desktop</h4><p>
Linux has provided my desktop environment 99.99% of the time since
somewhere around the days of Red Hat v3 (that's mid-1990s) at work (college
computer technology instructor, retired for about five years now) and at home.
I also used it on my laptop and several lab servers at work.
</p><p>
Applixware was the first office suite I used. Then came StarOffice and
currently OpenOffice.org. Regarding Bruce Byfield's article &ldquo;OpenOffice.org
vs. Microsoft Office&rdquo; in the February 2010 issue, he makes the
statement: &ldquo;Similarly, Impress lacks the
ability to use the pointer to draw on the screen during a
presentation.&rdquo;
This feature has been present for some years before I retired. To use it,
one simply must enable it in the Slide Show&rarr;Slide Show Settings menu.
The three-pane window of Impress was never an issue either. The best
solution for me was a dual-head system. Any geek worthy of the name should
be able to scrounge up a second monitor and a dual-head video card. The
extra screen space is very useful.
</p><p>
My only gripe with Linux is that somewhere between Fedora 8 and 9 the dual
head, aka multiple monitor, facility was broken for my video card, the
Matrox G450. I have reported the bug as new releases come along, but it is
still broken. I continue to use the latest release of Fedora for some
things, as I am right now, but when I need to be productive (for example,
programming, image editing, Web site development), it's back to my Fedora 8
system.
</p><p>
I encourage others to try OpenOffice.org whenever the opportunity arises.
It has served my needs well. What the future will bring to the desktop,
only time will tell. But as for me and my data and apps, I do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> want them
blended with the stuff out on the Net. Eat local, compute local. If it
comes from far away, I want to know.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Paul Almquist  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for the correction on OpenOffice.org. As far as the Matrox G450 goes,
I find it amazingly ironic that it doesn't work well, considering the
Matrox cards used to be the only video cards a Linux user could
rely on! Hopefully, things will straighten out for your trusty G450
soon.&mdash;Ed.

Linux Remote Desktop</h4><p>
I liked Michael J. Hammel's article &ldquo;Running Remote
Applications&rdquo; in the February 2010 issue, but there's an easier way
to get a remote desktop under Linux. I use
FreeNX (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX" target="_self">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX</a> is a good place to start)
provided by NoMachine (<a href="http://www.nomachine.com" target="_self">www.nomachine.com</a>). It's faster than VNC
and secure. I connect
to my desktop computer at home from my workplace, and it's almost like
sitting in front of the computer. Better still, it allows you to suspend a
session and reconnect to it later, so when I come back to work the next
day, I can resume the session, and all the windows I had open are still
ready to go, including whatever pages I had open in Firefox.
</p><p>
I sound like I work for NoMachine, but I just like it that much. It is
free software.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Marcus Huculak  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael J. Hammel replies:</b></span> I'd heard of
FreeNX and had looked at NoMachine some time back, but I 
simply didn't remember it before working on the article. Being an
old-timer, I was using XDMCP. Even VNC was new to me when I started into the
article. FreeNX certainly sounds like it's worth investigating in the
future.

An Honest Look</h4><p>
Regarding Bruce Byfield's &ldquo;OpenOffice.org vs. Microsoft
Office&rdquo; in the
February 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, the article compares the
features of both pieces of software, but it fails to compare the bugs. With
most professionally produced pieces of software, that would not be an issue,
but it is with OpenOffice.org.
</p><p>
I am in love with Linux and the Open Source movement, and I have been running
Linux in place of Windows on my home machine for a number of months
now. Generally, I am willing to trade flawless functionality for knowing
that what is installed on my computer is owned by me.
</p><p>
Usually, I don't need to make that trade, but with OpenOffice.org's Writer, I
have had to. Writer (and this is as true of the latest version
as with earlier versions I have used) randomly reformats and/or deletes
text for me. Sometimes, I save a document I have worked on, and when I open
it up, it is reformatted. Writer is, in my judgment,
unreliable. 
</p><p>
Whether or not this extends to the rest of the suite, I do not know;
however, this is not acceptable behavior from a piece of software that
purports to provide an essential piece of business functionality. For my own
home use, it is good enough, but the nonprofits I work with choose not to
use it, even though it is free, because they know that if they trust their
business with it, they will get burned.
</p><p>
I am a new entrant to the Open Source/Linux community and I look to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, as a kind of de facto authority to provide a clear and seasoned
perspective that I can rely on. Failing to address the bugginess (when it
exists) of open-source software supports a communally held fantasy of the
purity, nobility and infallibility of open-source software, which, in my
opinion, does not serve the community, and it certainly does not serve me.
</p><p>
Let's get real about this.
Thanks for a great magazine.

<span   class="bold"><b>Bruce Byfield replies:</b></span> I am sorry that you

Writer.
