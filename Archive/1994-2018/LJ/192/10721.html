The Linux-based OS is in a good position to win a much bigger category than
desktops.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a013b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux on the desktop has been around for a long time. So were jeeps, before
large numbers of them started showing up in suburban driveways, in the form
of SUVs. At the time of this writing (early January 2010), desktop Linux is still a jeep at
the pre-SUV stage. It also has been a decade (or more) since many of us
(myself included) began predicting that personal Linux computer sales would
hockey-stick in the next year. Alas, the market share estimates are still
low, even if they're not flat: 2.14% (from W3Counter), 0.67%, (from
StatCounter) and 1.02% (from NetApplications).
</p><p>
As always, there are encouraging signs. CES this year featured lots of
Linux-based devices. Lenovo showed the IdeaPad U1 (an odd but inventive
Linux-Windows hybrid) and the Skylight, which is due to be released in
April 2010. HP floated the Mini 5102, offering Linux as one of several
operating system options. These are all in the Netbook class, which has a
lot in common with MP3 players before the iPod came along, and smartphones
before iPhones came along&mdash;meaning that Netbooks are ripe for an Apple
offering that changes the whole game.
</p><p>
The rumor is that Apple will come out with a &ldquo;slate&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;tablet&rdquo; or
something else that will be old news by the time you read this. Apple's
offering, however, matters less than its strategy, which Keith Hopper
(<a href="http://keithhopper.com" target="_self">keithhopper.com</a>), a
technologist with NPR, explains this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Apple's genius is finding an immature market where progress is logjammed,
and building a whole new vertical silo around a piece of gotta-have-it
hardware. They did this with the iPod in the MP3 player market, and they
did it again with the iPhone in the smartphone market. Apple was brilliant
to recognize that the MP3 player and mobile markets were actually immature
and suffered from compatibility, usability, and performance issues that
could be addressed by slick and robust vertical integration. Never mind
that this was bad news for many customers, who in essence get locked-in by
the integration.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But, while Apple goes vertical, Google goes horizontal. For example, Google
created Wave to break the logjam in several categories at once, including
instant messaging and group editing. Google created Chrome and Gears to
provide rich client-side support for Web-based apps. All are open-source
platform planks, both for Google and for people who want to use them
(and improve them). They go horizontal so everybody (including Google) can
build all kinds of vertical stuff on them.
</p><p>
Those platform planks are the Google Chrome OS, about which the company blogged
this, last July:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Google Chrome OS is an open-source, lightweight operating system that will
initially be targeted at Netbooks. Later this, year we will open-source its
code, and Netbooks running Google Chrome OS will be available for consumers
in the second half of 2010....
</p><p>
Google Chrome OS will run on both x86 as well as ARM chips, and we are
working with multiple OEMs to bring a number of Netbooks to market next
year. The software architecture is simple&mdash;Google Chrome running
within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel. For application
developers, the Web is the platform....And of course, these apps will run
not only on Google Chrome OS, but on any standards-based browser on
Windows, Mac and Linux, thereby giving developers the largest user base of
any platform.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
They added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Google Chrome OS is a new project, separate from Android. Android was
designed from the beginning to work across a variety of devices from phones
to set-top boxes to Netbooks. Google Chrome OS is being created for people
who spend most of their time on the Web....
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But, while Chrome OS has to compete with Windows, Mac OS X and a zillion
Linux distros, Android has an easier job&mdash;and potentially a much larger
marketplace. Although Symbian, iPhone, RIM and Windows Mobile all have much
bigger market shares than Android, they still are mostly held captive to
partnerships between phone makers and carriers. Android was too, with early
versions, but that changed with Nexus One, which launched in January 2010. Nexus
One is the closest thing yet to a white-box phone design&mdash;one anybody can
use, with any carrier, and improve at the base code level as well. Think of
it as the smartphone equivalent of an SUV that anybody can make.
</p><p>
Application portfolios (among which Google's are becoming essential) will
help sell units, but Nexus One's independence from makers and carriers is
what will expand the market's envelope. The Nexus One is not made just for
Verizon or Vodaphone. It's horizontal, and it's open. You can add value to
it with more than just apps.
</p><p>
The Nexus One isn't quite as slick as the iPhone, but its evolutionary path
(and therefore that of Android) has none of the iPhone's proprietary
roadblocks and speed bumps. While Google has surely annoyed
&ldquo;partners&rdquo;, such
as Motorola (whose Android-based DROID was upstaged by the Nexus One), it
also has opened a path toward a liberated smartphone future. As the Nexus
One improves (to the Nexus Two and Three?), it's on track to score big in a
place that's even more personal than desks and laps: the hands, pockets and
purses of phone users everywhere.
