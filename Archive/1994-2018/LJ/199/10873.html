Even if you're not a programmer, you still can make yourself useful.

My parents were old-school. Literally. My mother (born 1913) started
teaching at age 19 in a one-room schoolhouse in rural North Dakota, where she
grew up. My father (born 1908) learned carpentry from his father (born 
1863) and taught me as well. I also absorbed a value both my parents shared.
&ldquo;Make yourself useful&rdquo;, they said, as often as they saw my sister or me
failing to do that.
</p><p>
Respect for usefulness gave me a special appreciation for Linux, as well as
for free and open-source code. Usefulness is why most free and open-source
code gets written in the first place. It's also what makes that code
valuable. &ldquo;The use value of a program is its economic value as a tool, a
productivity multiplier&rdquo;, Eric Raymond writes
(<a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/magic-cauldron/ar01s03.htm" target="_self">catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/magic-cauldron/ar01s03.htm</a>).
Elsewhere (<a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html" target="_self">catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html</a>),
he adds, &ldquo;Every good
work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.&rdquo; And,
&ldquo;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and
reuse).&rdquo;
</p><p>
I've never made myself useful as a programmer. As fate has it, the only code
I know is Morse. (Well, there's HTML, which I don't think counts much more
than Morse does.) My skills with electronics, such as they are, were
developed in my days as a ham radio operator, in the earliest 1960s. I was a
kid then, building radio things and cultivating a lifelong obsession with
devices that transmit, receive or both. For a while in my early adult life,
that obsession got me work manning radio station transmitters and doing site
studies for new FM stations. But I went on to other careers, and almost none
of what I knew about broadcasting many decades ago is of practical use now,
even in what's left of the broadcast field.
</p><p>
The other practical science I learned while young was darkroom chemistry.
That came out of my work as a newspaper photographer, around the turn of the
1970s. Today, none of my old darkroom skills (pushing, burning, dodging and
so on)
have much leverage. My skills as a photographer, however, have only improved
since I first picked up a digital camera about six years ago. At first, I
mostly shot candid photos of people, since that was my specialty back when I
did newspaper work. Then, after Flickr came along, I found I could do
something much more useful. I could put up pictures that others could reuse.
</p><p>
That wasn't the main idea behind Flickr, but it was the idea behind Flickr's
base code infrastructure, which was built from the ground up on Linux. It was
also the idea behind giving users a choice of Creative Commons licenses for
each of their pictures. I was familiar with Creative Commons before I started
posting photos on Flickr, but I hadn't had personal experience with Creative
Commons' effects. Flickr gave me that, in spades. What I discovered was that
many of my pictures were proving useful, mostly as visuals in Wikipedia
articles. That mattered far more to me than popularity or remuneration.
</p><p>
As of today (mid-August 2010), I have more than 36,000 photos on Flickr. All
carry Creative Commons licenses that permit reuse and remixing. Most of
them are captioned or tagged, making them easy to find when searching for one
of their subjects. In last June's EOF, I told the story of how some of my
winter shots ended up serving as wallpaper for NBC's 2010 Winter Olympics
coverage. That was cool, but far cooler is seeing 153 of my photos show up in
Wikimedia Commons
(<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=doc+searls" target="_self">commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=doc+searls</a>), through no additional effort of my own. Some shots are of
people (including Eric. S. Raymond, Nat Friedman and Guido van Rossum). But
most shots are of places I've seen out the windows of airplanes. These
include a town in Nebraska, a lake in Norway, an island in Scotland's Outer
Hebrides, a lava field in the Grand Canyon, salt ponds in San Francisco Bay
and a glacier in Greenland. Nearly all of them illustrate at least one
Wikipedia article. Some illustrate many. For example, a shot of the spiky
white fabric roof of Denver International Airport shows up in 17
different articles across 13 language versions.

Salt Ponds in San Francisco Bay
</p></div></div><p>
I think of each photo as a potential code patch to our body of common
knowledge, not as a work of art. If they make themselves useful, then I've
done the same.
