Web site vulnerabilities often occur in very non-obvious ways.
Whether you're a Web developer or run a Web site,
you need to understand how it's done and how to test your site.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e2580.0x16da250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Almost every week the media picks up on another case of sensitive data
being retrieved from Web sites with bad security. Web application security
never has
been more important, yet many Web sites never have been audited
for security in a meaningful way. Although careful application architecture
can help minimize security risks in code, a complete approach to Web
application security considers the entire life cycle of the application,
from development to deployment. In order to test whether your Web site
is truly secure, consider using the same tools attackers do.
</p><p>
Penetration testing is the art of assessing the security of a system by
simulating an attack or series of attacks. The goal of the
penetration test is not necessarily to exploit the system if a flaw is
found, but to audit potential attack vectors stringently and provide
data that can be used to evaluate the potential risk of an exploit,
and to find a solution to secure the system.
</p><p>
The Samurai Web Testing Framework is a security-oriented distribution
that focuses on penetration testing for Web applications. It includes
a variety of graphical, command-line and browser-based tools to test
for common Web vulnerabilities. It's available as a live CD image from
<a href="http://samurai.inguardians.com" target="_self">samurai.inguardians.com</a>.
</p><p>
In this article, I look at using Samurai to test for a
couple of the top Web application security risks as defined by the Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This is not specifically
a list of attack vectors. Technically, many of the risks listed below
are exploited using various forms of SQL injection. Rather, this list was
developed by OWASP combining &ldquo;threat agents, attack vectors, weaknesses,
technical impacts and business impacts...to produce risks&rdquo;.
OWASP's top ten risks (<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10" target="_self">www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10</a>):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>
In the interests of keeping the scope of this article manageable, I
focus on injection flaws and cross-site scripting.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span> please do not try any of these examples on production
Web sites. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> recommends that you set up a virtual environment

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e2580.0x16daf08"></a>
Injection Flaws</h2></div></div><p>
Injection flaws occur when the application passes user input to an
interpreter without checking it for possible malicious effects. Injection
flaws can include operating system command injection, LDAP injection
and injection of many other interpreters called by a Web application
using dynamic queries. One of the most common injection vectors is SQL
injection. Depending on the specific vulnerability, attackers could
read passwords or credit-card numbers, insert data into the database that
gives them access to the application or maliciously tamper with or delete
data. In extreme cases, operating system files could be read or arbitrary
system commands could be executed&mdash;meaning game over for the Web
server.
</p><p>
Login forms are primary targets for SQL injection, as a successful
exploit will give attackers access to the application. To start
testing an application for SQL injection vulnerabilities, let's
use some characters that have special meaning in SQL to try to
generate an SQL error. The simplest test, using a single quote (') as
the user name, failed to generate an error, so let's try a
double quote followed by a single quote ("'):


<pre     class="programlisting">
SQL Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual
           that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the
           right syntax to use near '"''' at line 1

SQL Statement: SELECT * FROM accounts
                        WHERE username='"'' AND password='"''
</pre>
</p><p>
Not only is this form vulnerable to SQL injection,
but also the error message has thrown up the exact SQL statement being
used. This is all the information you need to break into this application,
by using the following text in both the user name and password fields:

<pre     class="programlisting">
' or 1=1 --
</pre>
</p><p>
This changes the original
query to one that can match either the correct user name and password,
or to test if 1=1. Because 1=1 will evaluate to true, the application
accepts this as your login credentials and authenticates you. Even worse,
assuming you're not attackers, once you're logged in,
you now can see that you're the admin user. This
is because the SQL query will look at each row, one by one, to see on
which row the query returns true. Because you've tampered with it always
to return true, MySQL will return the first row. Because the first user created
is quite often the administrator or root user (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10874f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The first row of the users table often contains the administrator
user.
</p></div></div><p>
Not all applications are going to prove so easy to break into&mdash;particularly those that do not divulge as much information about the
database and table structure in the error message. An auditing
tool will let you iterate over a range of possible strings quickly. w3af,
the Web Application Attack and Audit Framework, has a range of plugins
to assist in scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities, including
SQL injection.
</p><p>
Launch the w3af GUI from the Applications&rarr;Samurai&rarr;Discovery
menu. Enter the Web site URL you'd like to test in the Target: field,
and then expand the options under discovery in the plugin box. Scroll
down until you find the webSpider plugin, and check its box to enable
it. In the pane to the right, the options for the webSpider plugin will
be shown. Tick onlyForward, and select Save Configuration. Now,
scroll back to the top of the plugins box, and expand Audit. Scroll
down to sqli and check its box to enable it.
</p><p>
Once the scan is completed, you can look at the Results tab and see
that w3af found seven separate places within the application
that could be exploited by SQL injection (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10874f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. w3af Results Tab, Showing Discovered Vulnerabilities
</p></div></div><p>
Another tool included with Samurai that can discover SQL injection
vulnerabilities is Grendel-Scan. Launch Grendel-Scan from the
Applications&rarr;Samurai&rarr;Discovery menu. Under Base URLs, insert the URL of the
Web application you would like to test and click Add. Untick Enable
Internal Proxy. Let's use Grendel's Web spidering module instead. Under
Scan Output, select a directory for Grendel-Scan to store its output
report. This directory must not exist. The application will expect to
create it. Select Start Scan from the Scan menu to start.
</p><p>
The scan will take some minutes to complete, depending on the size of
the Web application. Once finished, navigate to the designated output
directory to view the report. Here, report.html tells you that among
other issues, a possible SQL injection vulnerability was found (Figure 3).
The clean output of Grendel-Scan makes it a great tool to send attractive
and easy-to-read vulnerability reports to upper management as part of
a reporting requirement.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e2580.0x16db9b0"></a>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2></div></div><p>
Cross-site scripting can occur when the application accepts user input
and sends it back to the browser without validating it for malicious
code. There are two types of XSS attacks: reflected and stored. A
stored attack injects code into the page that is persistent and will be
activated by the victim's browser when requesting the page. A common
example of a stored cross-site scripting attack would be a script that
is injected through a comment field, forum post or guestbook. If the
application doesn't guard against potentially malicious input data and
allows the script to be stored, the browser of the next person to load the page will
execute the malicious code.
</p><p>
By contrast, a reflected or nonpersistent cross-site scripting attack
requires the victim to click on a link from another source. Here, instead
of being stored in the Web application's database, the malicious script is
encoded in the URL. XSS exploits can allow attackers to deface a Web site,
redirect legitimate traffic to their own site or a site of their choice,
and even steal session data through cookies.
</p><p>
This first test utilizes a formidable tool that enjoys wide popularity
among attackers&mdash;a Web browser. Although automated tools can take the pain
out of iterating over a long list of tests, the simplest method to start
testing your site for XSS vulnerabilities is by using a browser. You'll
need to find a page on the application you'd like to test that accepts
user input and then displays it&mdash;something like a guestbook, comment
field or even a search dialog that displays the search string as part
of the results.
</p><p>
The canonical check for an XSS vulnerability is considered to be the
snippet of code below:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script&gt;alert('xss!')&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If the Web site isn't properly filtering input, this script will execute
in the browser and then display a pop-up message with the text
&ldquo;xss&rdquo;. There's
some bad news for my little Web application here. It's so vulnerable
that this simplest of strings was able to exploit it (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10874f4.large.jpg"><img src="10874f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. XSS Vulnerability Executed
</p></div></div><p>
Usually, at least some form of input filtering is employed, and this string
won't get through intact. By examining the source of the generated page,
you can try to diagnose what characters are being filtered to craft more
sophisticated strings. If you inject the same string into a slightly more
secure Web form, you can see by the result that the script tags are being
stripped out and the single quotes are escaped:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Name: Me!
Message: alert(\'XSS!\')
</pre>
</p><p>
You could continue encoding different parts of the string and observing
the results to try to get past the filter. Or, to speed up the process,
you could use an automated tool. Samurai includes the XSS Me plugin for
Firefox by Security Compass. Navigate to the page you'd like to test, 
then select XSS Me&rarr;Open XSS Me Sidebar from the Tools menu. Select
Test all forms with top attacks from the sidebar.
For the curious, the strings that the XSS Me uses can be viewed
in Tools&rarr;XSS Me&rarr;Options&rarr;XSS Strings, and more strings can be added.
</p><p>
Figure 5 shows that XSS Me has discovered that this application is vulnerable
to DOM-based XSS attacks. This is a particularly insidious way of exploiting
an application, as it doesn't rely on the application embedding the
malicious code in the HTML output.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10874f5.large.jpg"><img src="10874f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. XSS Me Test Results
</p></div></div><p>
Another tool that can scan for XSS vulnerabilities in Samurai is, again,
w3af. This powerhouse
tool is capable of scanning for and exploiting almost any vulnerability
you care to name. Here, let's configure it to scan the Web application
for XSS vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
Launch the w3af GUI from the Applications&rarr;Samurai&rarr;Discovery menu. Enter
the Web site URL you'd like to test in the Target: field, and then expand
the options under discovery in the plugin box. Scroll down until you
find the webSpider plugin and check its box to enable it. In the pane
to the right, the options for the webSpider plugin will be shown. Tick
onlyForward and select Save Configuration. Now, scroll back to
the top of the plugins box, and expand Audit. Scroll down to xss,
and check its box to enable it (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10874f6.large.jpg"><img src="10874f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. w3af Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
Click Start to start the audit process. Depending on the size of the
Web application, this could take a few minutes as the spider plugin
discovers every URL, and then the audit plugin tests all applicable forms
for XSS vulnerabilities. Once complete, navigate to the Results
tab, which will itemize the vulnerabilities found.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although useful, penetration testing is only part of the picture. To
truly address these risks, applications must be designed, implemented
and deployed with security in mind. Code analysis tools are helpful in
locating places where application code deals with user inputs, so the
code can be audited for input validation, strong output encoding and
safe quote handling. Careful deployment using the principle of least
privilege and employing chroot jails can help minimize the damage 
attackers can do if they gain access to your application. Never allow your
database or Web server process to run as the root user.
</p><p>
Hopefully, this article can serve as a jumping off point to help you
approach Web application security from a more active point of view,
but there are many exploits and aspects of these two specific exploits
that aren't covered here. For further reading, see the OWASP Wiki
