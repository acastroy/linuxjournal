If you find yourself always typing the same set of commands, it's time to write a script.
This month, it's a script to rename and renumber files.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1823580.0x191b3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm guessing that each of us uses the command line differently
and seeks to accomplish different tasks. Mine are sometimes
very specialized, like the script I wrote that lets me easily
transform the unique filenames from the Mac OS X built-in screen-capture utility into a Web-friendly format.
</p><p>
In the past few weeks, I realized I needed another fairly
specialized script for file renaming, but this time, I wanted to
write something as generally useful as possible.
</p><p>
There's already a utility included in some flavors of Linux
called rename, but, alas, I couldn't find it on my Linux/NetBSD systems. If you have it, it probably duplicates the
functionality I create this month. Still, read on. Hopefully,
this'll be useful and interesting!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1823580.0x191b618"></a>
Rename/Pattern/Newpattern</h2></div></div><p>
It's surprising how often I find myself on the command line
typing in something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in xx*
do
    new="$(echo $name | sed 's/xx/yy/')"
    mv $name $new
done
</pre>
</p><p>
So, that's the first part of the script I want to create, one
that lets me just specify the OLD and NEW filename patterns,
then simply renames all files matching &ldquo;OLD&rdquo; with the
&ldquo;NEW&rdquo; pattern substituted.
</p><p>
For example, say I have test-file-1.txt and test-file-2.jpg
and want to replace &ldquo;test-file&rdquo; with &ldquo;demo&rdquo;.
The goal is to have an invocation like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rename test-file demo
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1823580.0x191b9e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and have it do all the work for me. Sound good?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1823580.0x191bae8"></a>
How Many Matching Files?</h2></div></div><p>
The first step is actually the most difficult: matching an
arbitrary pattern and catching any possible error conditions
gracefully. The loop is going to end up looking like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in $1*
</pre>
</p><p>
If there aren't any matches, however, you get an ugly error
message and the script looks amateurish. So, the goal is actually to
ascertain before the for loop how many matches there
are to that given pattern.
</p><p>
Ah, okay, so <tt  >ls $1* | wc -l</tt> does the trick, right?
Nope, that'll still generate the same ugly error message.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there's a way in Bash that you can redirect stderr
to go to stdout (that is, to have your error messages appear as
standard messages, able to be rerouted, piped and so on).
</p><p>
The test for the number of matches, thus, can be done like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

matches="$(ls -1 $1* 2&gt;&amp;1 | wc -l)"

</pre>
</p><p>
I know, it's complicated. Worse, a quick test reveals that when
there are zero matches, <tt  >ls -l</tt> actually generates an error
message: <tt  >ls: No such file or directory</tt>. That's not good.
The solution? Add a grep to the sequence:


<pre     class="programlisting">

matches="$(ls -1 $1* 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v "No such file" | wc -l)"

</pre>
</p><p>
That's even more complicated, but it works exactly as we'd
like. &ldquo;matches&rdquo; is zero in the situation where there aren't
any matches; otherwise, it has the number of matching files and
folders for the given pattern.
</p><p>
A test now lets us produce a meaningful and informative error
message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $matches -eq 0 ] ; then
    echo "Error: no files match pattern $1*"
    exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Because we're looking at stderr versus stdout, we also could more
properly route that error message to stderr with
<tt  >&gt;&amp;2</tt>, and to be
totally correct, we should exit with a nonzero error code to
indicate that the script failed to execute properly. I'll leave
those tweaks as an exercise for the reader.
</p><p>
Now that we know we'll never hit the for loop without at
least one match, the core code is straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in $1*
do
    new="$(echo $name | sed "s/$1/$2/")"
    mv $name $new
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice in this instance that you can't use the single quotes
within the <tt  >$( )</tt> command substitution;
if you do, $1 and $2 won't be expanded properly.
</p><p>
We certainly could just stop here and have a useful little
script, but I'm into wicked cool scripts, so let's push on,
shall we?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1823580.0x191c430"></a>
Sequential File Numbering</h2></div></div><p>
The other feature I constantly find myself needing is the
ability to number a series of files sequentially. For example,
a final set of photos from a photo shoot might be DSC1017,
DSC1019, DSC1023 and DSC1047. It would be more useful to be able to
renumber those before sending them to a client, so that they're
DSC-1, DSC-2, DSC-3 and so on.
</p><p>
This is pretty easily accomplished too, now that we have a script
that renames a sequence of files. Here's how I accomplish it
in the script itself:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $renumber -eq 1 ] ; then
    suffix="$(echo $name | cut -d. -f2- | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]')"
    new="$2$count.$suffix"
    count=$(( $count + 1 ))
    mv $name $new
    chmod a+r $new
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Here I am expecting to replace the entire filename, so I
strip out and save the filename suffix (for example, DSC1015.JPG
becomes JPG), so I can re-attach it later. While I'm at it,
filename suffixes also are normalized to all lowercase using
the handy tr command.
</p><p>
The count variable keeps track of what number we're on, and
notice the built-in shell notation of <tt  >$(( ))</tt> for mathematical
calculations.
</p><p>
Finally, the new filename is built from the new pattern ($2),
plus the count ($count), plus the filename suffix ($suffix) in
this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
new="$2$count.$suffix"
</pre>
</p><p>
The two conditions need to be merged, however, so the final
script ends up with an if-then-else-fi structure.
</p><p>
I can't leave well enough alone, so I continued to tweak the
script by adding a few starting flags too. To parse it all, our
friend getopt is utilized:


<pre     class="programlisting">
args=$(getopt npt $*)

if [ $? != 0 -o $# -lt 2 ] ; then
    echo "Usage: $(basename $0) {-p} {-n} {-t} PATTERN NEWPATTERN"
    echo "
    echo " -p  rewrites PNG to png"
    echo " -n  sequentially numbers matching files with"
    echo "     NEWPATTERN as base filename"
    echo " -t  test mode: show what you'll do, don't do it."
    exit 0
fi

set -- $args
for i
do
    case "$i" in
    -n ) renumber=1 ; shift ;;
    -p ) fixpng=1   ; shift ;;
    -t ) doit=0     ; shift ;;
    -- ) shift      ; break ;;
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
I've written about getopt and its complicated usage in
shell scripts before if you want to read up on it [see &ldquo;Parsing
Command-Line Options with getopt&rdquo; in the July 2009 issue
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10495" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10495</a>]. Note that three
flags are available to the script user: <tt  >-n</tt> invokes the
renumbering capability (which means the filenames are discarded,
remember); <tt  >-p</tt> is a special case where .PNG also is rewritten
as .png; and <tt  >-t</tt> is a sort of
&ldquo;echo-only&rdquo; mode where the
rename doesn't actually happen, the script just shows what it
would do based on the patterns given.
</p><p>
How am I using it now? Like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rename -n IMG_ iphone-copy-paste-
</pre>
</p><p>
Every matching .PNG file (IMG_*) has that portion of its name
replaced with &ldquo;iphone-copy-paste-&rdquo;, and as it proceeds,
&ldquo;PNG&rdquo; is also rewritten as &ldquo;png&rdquo;.
</p><p>
