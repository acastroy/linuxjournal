Using simple Web technologies, you can turn your smartphone into
a multipurpose device to control your computers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11c12a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Phone technology has come a long way recently. The gap between
personal computers and handheld devices is becoming smaller. I keep
hearing the phrase &ldquo;death of the PC&rdquo;, and there may be some truth to this
statement. However, I believe many of us will continue to need access to
larger and more powerful computers that are too big to fit in our pockets.
To me, the best of both worlds is to have full control over a larger computer
from my phone.
</p><p>
Many new smartphones have advanced Web browsers built in. With this
technology, you can access an interface configured to run any command
on almost any computer. It is fairly trivial to run a Web server on a Linux
box. If you take the appropriate security measures, you quickly can build
a Web interface designed specifically for handheld devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11c1568"></a>
Security</h2></div></div><p>
The approach shown in this article is to use a user account to run commands on the system.
Of course, there are security concerns in doing this,
but with the appropriate precautions, it can be made reasonably secure.
</p><p>
The system will rely on Wi-Fi. This makes sense when dealing with handheld
devices, so configure your Wi-Fi router with a password.
Users that want to connect to the local intranet will have to
enter a password into their device before seeing anything. Most devices
will remember the credentials and connect automatically once in range.
</p><p>
To minimize the risks in the event of a security breach, let's also
create the user account with minimal permissions.
This is a good safety measure, even though the interfaces will 
expose only &ldquo;safe&rdquo; commands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11c1778"></a>
Setup</h2></div></div><p>
Install the following from your distribution's repository if not already
installed: Apache2, apache2-suexec and libapache2-mod-perl2.
</p><p>
The first package is the Web server. If it doesn't start automatically 
after the install, run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/apache2 start
</pre>
</p><p>
The second package allows you to run the Web server with the credentials of
a particular system user. When it is installed, you need to issue the
following command as root to enable the apache module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a2enmod suexec
</pre>
</p><p>
Some of the examples presented here require Perl CGI interoperability.
The last package is needed for that.
</p><p>
Now, you need to configure Apache to run as your little-trusted user. On
our family Linux box, I created an account for all the kids. The
user name is &ldquo;saturn&rdquo;. This account can do things like play
music and watch videos.
However, it doesn't belong to any groups that can delete or change
things of importance. So let's use this account as an example.
</p><p>
Edit your apache config, and add the following line to the default
VirtualHost (*:80) or to the VirtualHost you want to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SuexecUserGroup saturn saturn
</pre>
</p><p>
Apache runs as root, so it has the ability to run scripts as any user.
The line above tells Apache to run as the user saturn and group saturn.
</p><p>
Now, restart Apache, also as root, with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
The Web service now is running as the user saturn.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11c1cf8"></a>
The Simplest Example</h2></div></div><p>
Playing a sound file from the command line is fairly trivial, and it's a good
way to exhibit the simplicity of this setup&mdash;one button for one
action.
</p><p>
I'm using a traditional Web stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and CGI. The CGI part can be accomplished with a number of different
languages. This first example uses a shell script, for the sake of
simplicity.
</p><p>
Create an index.html file in the root Web directory. For many systems,
this is located in /var/www/. Some systems use /var/www/html/. In this
file, add a button that calls a JavaScript function called
playQuack():


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;button id="quack-button" onclick="playQuack()"&gt;Quack&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The JavaScript for the playQuack() function is in bonkers.js.
The entire index.html file looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Bonkers&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport"
          content="initial-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"/&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="default.css" /&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="bonkers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;button id="quack-button" onclick="playQuack()"&gt;Quack&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Some additional content worth mentioning is in the metatag. This tells
smartphones not to scale the content of the page. Without this, the button would
be very tiny on the screen.
</p><p>
Here is my default.css file. It defines a background color and
specifies how the button will look:

<pre     class="programlisting">
html, body {
  background-color: #1E1E26;
}

button#quack-button {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20%;
  width: 70%;
  left: 15%;
  padding: 5px;
  border-width: 3px;
  color: #BFBFBF;
  font-size: 34px;
  font-weight: 800;
  border-color: #9C9C9C;
  background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top
      left bottom, from(#BF5A34), to(#463630));
      -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Many mobile browsers are starting to support WebKit CSS. This is
exciting, because a couple lines of WebKit code can do some really
fancy things. The last two lines before the last curly bracket tell
the button to have rounded corners and a color gradient background.
</p><p>
Now you have a nice-looking button. Point the browser on your phone to
the IP address of the Linux computer. You should see something similar
to Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10837f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Simple Button Displayed on an iPhone
</p></div></div><p>
Next, let's make the button actually do something. Create the
bonkers.js file in the root Web directory, and enter the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var myDomain = document.domain;
var cgiURL   = "http://" + myDomain + "/cgi-bin/bonkers.cgi";
var xmlRequest;

function playQuack() {
  xmlRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xmlRequest.open("GET", cgiURL, true);
  xmlRequest.send(null);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the JavaScript that forms the client-side process. It creates a
URL that essentially runs the CGI script on your Linux box. In this
example, you really don't care about the return value from the CGI
script.
</p><p>
Believe it or not, the hard part is all done. CGI scripts are
extremely simple and easy to understand&mdash;especially for someone who is
used to the command line.
</p><p>
All CGI scripts must be located in the cgi-bin directory. This commonly
is located in /var/www/cgi-bin or /usr/lib/cgi-bin and
is also configurable within Apache.
</p><p>
Here is the CGI script, bonkers.cgi:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash

mplayer ~/quack.wav &amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
That's all. This is a Bash shell script. A reference to the shell path
is at the top. Below that is a command to run MPlayer, which plays an
annoying quack sound. You essentially can place any shell command here.
</p><p>
There you have it. Anybody with a smartphone and the Wi-Fi password can
make quack sounds come out of the computer.
Now it's time to do something a little more useful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11c27a0"></a>
Big Meanie</h2></div></div><p>
My wife and I have four kids. All of which compete for time on our
family Linux box. The computer, which is named Saturn, is constantly
logged in with the account &ldquo;saturn&rdquo;. All kids use this account and are
either watching TV, videos, YouTube, listening to music or playing Flash
games on the Internet. I was getting sick of kicking the kids off the
computer at supper time. This is why the interface
&ldquo;big-meanie&rdquo; was
created.
</p><p>
This next application scales up the previous example. I chose to use
Perl as the CGI language, mostly because I am a longtime Perl user and
fan. In the following example, I omit the HTML and CSS code because
it's not significantly different from the code in the first example.
</p><p>
The main difference being that this example has three buttons:
one is for starting a five-minute countdown until all fun is over.
Another is to stop the countdown, just in case I have a change of heart.
The last is when I really mean business and want to terminate all
applicable programs immediately.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows the layout of Big Meanie.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10837f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Big Meanie Displayed on an iPhone
</p></div></div><p>
The first button gives the kids a five-minute countdown to get off the
computer. I thought it appropriate to have visual indicators popup over
the current windows on the desktop. You need to set a few shell variables
in order to output to the local display: XAUTHORITY,
HOME and DISPLAY. The following Perl commands accomplish this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ENV{'XAUTHORITY'} = '/home/saturn/.Xauthority';
$ENV{'HOME'} = '/home/saturn';
$ENV{'DISPLAY'} = ':0';
</pre>
</p><p>
This allows windows to open on the local display, even though the
command was instigated remotely.
</p><p>
The next thing to note is that you have more than one function
to perform, so you need to inform the script which action
to perform (that is, which button was pressed).
Since you're are dealing with Web URLs here, appending your parameter to the URL is the
easiest way to accomplish this. Using a ? sign tells your script
that the following text is a parameter. That parameter will be the action to perform.
</p><p>
Here is the full JavaScript file for Big Meanie:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var myDomain = document.domain; // Grab current domain.
var cgiURL  = "http://" + myDomain + "/cgi-bin/big-meanie.cgi";
var xmlRequest;

// This is the logic for the "5 Minute Warning" button
function warn5() {
  xmlRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
  // Add the 5min variable to the URL
  xmlRequest.open("GET",cgiURL + "?5min", true);
  xmlRequest.send(null);
}

// This is the logic for the "Cancel Countdown" button
function cancel() {
  xmlRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
  // Add the cancel variable to the URL
  xmlRequest.open("GET",cgiURL + "?cancel", true);
  xmlRequest.send(null);
}

// This is the logic for the "Get Off Now" button
function offnow() {
  xmlRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
  // Add the off-now variable to the URL
  xmlRequest.open("GET",cgiURL + "?off-now", true);
  xmlRequest.send(null);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Each button has its own JavaScript function. The URL to the CGI script
is appended with the appropriate variable within each function. The
variable then is passed to the CGI script with the xmlRequest.send()
function.
</p><p>
All action up until now has been happening on the phone browser. Now,
let's dive into the script on the server, big-meanie.pl.
</p><p>
There is one last important thing to mention before going over the
server-side script (Listing 1). Internet browsers expect a response from sites
when making a URL request. The browser hangs if there is no response.
You can get around this by creating a second thread that responds automatically
with an empty message. The browser doesn't get stuck when the
server is executing the command this way, which is important for what
you're about to do.

    }
}

</pre></div><p>
The action variable from the URL is grabbed through the $ARGV[0] array.
The if statements that follow test which variable has been
specified and, therefore, which action to execute.
The first action, <tt  >5min</tt>, executes a five-minute warning by forking
the CGI script (creating a copy of the process).
The &ldquo;parent&rdquo; branch of the fork executes the if part of the if
statement,
and the &ldquo;child&rdquo; branch executes the else part.
The parent sends an empty HTML response to the
browser so the client doesn't hang and pops up a five-minute
warning message box using Zenity.
Zenity provides a simple GUI interface that can be accessed
from scripts, and it should be installed by default on most GNOME
desktops. There are alternatives for KDE users, such as kdialog or
whiptail.
The advantage of putting the pop-up dialog in a separate thread from the
countdown notifications is the script doesn't stall if the current user
doesn't click the OK button on the Zenity window.
</p><p>
The child portion of the fork does the actual five-minute countdown.
I wanted to be a little humane here and provide subtle notifications
of how much time is left before the user is kicked off. This allows
the older kids to save their session or work. My younger kids just
need to be eased into the idea of stopping.
</p><p>
The child part of the script sleeps for 60 seconds after the dialog appears.
A simple notification then is sent to the desktop once the child wakes up.
It appears as a standard GNOME notification in the upper right of the
screen. Figure 3 shows how this appears to the user. This
procedure repeats until the countdown is complete. Next, the
meanie part of Big Meanie kicks in and sends a kill signal to any fun type
of program the kids could be enjoying.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10837f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. GNOME Notification on the Desktop Displaying the Time Remaining
</p></div></div><p>
I used the notify-send command commonly installed with GNOME. It is
included in the libnotify-bin package, and it should be in most distribution
repositories. KDE users can use kdialog with the --passivepopup flag
instead of notify-send.
</p><p>
The second if statement is for the cancel countdown button. It sends a
kill signal to all instances of big-meanie, essentially killing itself
and all sleeping instances, which will kill any previously started
five-minute wait child processes that are waiting to shut down things.
</p><p>
The last if statement doesn't need much explanation. It kicks the user
off immediately and is almost identical to the first, excluding the
countdown logic. You already may have noticed the juicy little addition
at the very end of the code: big-meanie sends a status update to Twitter stating
somebody has been kicked off the computer. It seemed appropriate for
big-meanie to gloat to the whole world that someone's fun has been
terminated. It also acts as a safety feature informing me if one of the
kids has discovered the program and is possibly using it in any unfriendly fashion
on fellow siblings.

Other Possibilities</h2></div></div><p>
The most-used application I have built is a television remote control.
We use the fantastic tvtime program to watch all our TV. The tvtime
package includes the <tt  >tvtime-command</tt> command that allows you to control
every conceivable function of the running tvtime instance. For example,
<tt  >tvtime-command chan-up</tt> changes the channel up one increment. Full
documentation can be found in the tvtime man page.
</p><p>
I used all the same techniques described earlier and built a full
functioning remote shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10837f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Remote Control Application Shown on a Palm Pre
</p></div></div><p>
Now friends and family can control the TV from the comfort of their
very own smartphones. There are no more complaints about using our
giant Bluetooth keyboard as a remote either. The kids simply can grab
the closest iPod Touch, Palm Pre or whatever.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c9580.0x11ba3c8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Smartphone technology is advancing extremely rapidly. Without modifying the
phone, you can access almost any possible function on a remote computer through
the built-in browser. Linux users are especially lucky. It doesn't
take much effort to turn a Linux computer into a back end for a phone.
Hopefully, this article inspires you to come up with your own
unique and interesting uses.
