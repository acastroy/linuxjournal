<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #199, November 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Airlie</b></span> has said that he won't accept
any <span   class="bold"><b>DRM</b></span> (Direct Rendering
Manager) drivers from companies that release only an open-source-crippled version of the driver, so they can layer their proprietary
user-space version on top. Amazingly, he came under criticism for
that from people accusing him of playing to his employer's (<span   class="bold"><b>Red
Hat</b></span>'s) business interests. He denied it, and several other folks also
said David wouldn't do that. Personally, it seems to me that David is
just upholding a solid open-source ethic. There are real technical
reasons why layering proprietary user-space code over a crippled kernel
driver is not the best way to go. At the same time, it's not clear how
to prevent companies from doing that. If they add a certain level of
functionality, the driver will make it into the kernel, and then they
still can put their proprietary enhancements on top. We'll be seeing
this debate heat up in the near-to-middle term, because of all the 3-D
video drivers that soon will be flooding the world.
</p><p>
It looks like the <span   class="bold"><b>console code</b></span> is going to receive a major overhaul in
the near future. <span   class="bold"><b>Mattia Jona-Lasinio</b></span> wrote
up an in-kernel <span   class="bold"><b>VT102
emulator</b></span>, which essentially was rejected on the grounds that
everything it did could be implemented as an enhancement to the
console code. Not only that, but as <span   class="bold"><b>Alan
Cox</b></span> pointed out, there's a
whole big pile of 3-D graphics people who very much want the kernel
console code to be revamped and enhanced. <span   class="bold"><b>James
Simmons</b></span> also has been
interested in fixing up the console code, so it looks as though he and
Mattia are going to work on it together. They each compiled big lists
of things that would be very good to fix, and in spite of the daunting
complexity, it does seem as if they're going ahead with it. And, with
the blessing of someone like Alan Cox, it seems like they'll have a
lot of support for getting their code ultimately into the kernel.
</p><p>
Once in a while a strange and funny thing crops up on the mailing list.
This time, a completely anonymous person suggested implementing
<span   class="bold"><b>Kademlia</b></span> at the kernel level. Kademlia is a peer-to-peer networking
protocol used for creating large, anonymous data-sharing networks. The
anonymous person suggested that with Kademlia at the kernel level, it
would obviate all the user-space implementations and allow all Linux
computers to become one with the universe, in an immense, all-powerful
file-sharing service that could never be stopped! Unfortunately for
this plan, a lot of folks pointed out that the existence of plenty of
user-space implementations of Kademlia was a good indication that
there was no need to stick it into the kernel. So, the anonymous person
went away unsatisfied.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nick Piggin</b></span> has started a new git repository, just to house patches
for scaling the <span   class="bold"><b>VFS</b></span> (Virtual Filesystem). One patch on the system
helped make name lookups go much faster by reducing the amount of
data movement that had to happen for each lookup. VFS speedups are
great because all filesystems rely on the VFS for fundamental
operations. A speedup in the VFS means a speedup for every filesystem
out there.

<h2 class="title">Hacking, Old-School</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #199, November 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When you mention hacking in the general public, the image most people think
of is a nerdy guy breaking into a computer system
from his bedroom. This month, I take a look at some of the tools available to do
exactly that. Of course, this is for information purposes only, so please
don't do anything nasty. Remember, with great power comes great
responsibility. Most people have heard of tools like Nmap or Nessus, but here
I look at some other available tools for playing with
networks.
</p><p>
The granddaddy of network utilities is tcpdump. This utility simply
listens to all network traffic going by and records the
packets for later analysis. If you have more than one network interface,
you can select which one to listen to with the option <tt  >-i
interface</tt>. By
default, tcpdump puts your network card into promiscuous mode, so it
can record all packets that exist on the network cable. If you want to
limit the packets recorded simply to those destined for your machine, 
use the <tt  >-p</tt> option to turn off promiscuous mode. Lots of
options are available to tcpdump, so check out the man page for more
details.
</p><p>
Say you want to find out what machines exist on
your network. Several tools can do this by actively
sending out queries on the network. The problem with this
technique is that you end up creating traffic on the network, which may
be noticed by a good network administrator. A way around this is to use the
tool p0f. This utility uses passive techniques to try to guess what
machines exist on the network and properties about those machines. If you
have more than one network interface, you can select which interface to use
with the option <tt  >-i interface</tt>. p0f can work with tcpdump files. If you
have a tcpdump file that you created earlier, you can make p0f use it
rather than live capture with the <tt  >-s file</tt> option.
You also can use
p0f to record network traffic into a tcpdump file with the <tt  >-w
file</tt> option. If you're using p0f in a script, use the
<tt  >-o file</tt> option to
dump the output into a text file for later perusal.
</p><p>
By default, p0f looks only at network packets that are addressed to the
machine where it is running. To look at all the packets that go by on
the network, you need to set the card into promiscuous mode with the
<tt  >-p</tt> option. By default, p0f sees machines only when they open new
connections. You can try to guess what's going on with already-opened
connections with the <tt  >-O</tt> option. This option can generate a lot of data,
so you probably won't want to use it for an extended period of time. 
</p><p>
More
and more often, machines actually are located behind routers
and NATs, so they don't really show up as individual machines. You can
try to identify these types of machines with the <tt  >-M</tt>
option. This uses
the masquerade-detection algorithm to try to identify individual machines
in these situations.
</p><p>
Once you know what machines exist on the network, you may be interested in
what traffic is traveling to those machines, as well as who is generating this
traffic. You can use dsniff to see the user names and passwords
being used to access services on the network. It can handle many different
protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, POP, IMAP, X11 and many others. You can tell
dsniff on which interface to listen with the <tt  >-i
interface</tt> option. Like
most network tools, you can read previously recorded network data with the
<tt  >-p file</tt> option. Alternatively, you can use dsniff to record the network
data rather than parsing it with the <tt  >-w file</tt> option. You can enable
automatic protocol detection by using the <tt  >-m</tt> option. This can give you
some of the gory details about people on your network.
</p><p>
Now that you know some details about your network, and the people on it,
you may want to check the security of some of the services provided. One
common target for security problems are Web servers. You can use the 
nikto tool to assess your Web server's security. Select the
host with the <tt  >-h hostname</tt> option. If you have a series of hosts you want
to check, place the hostnames (or IP addresses) in a text file, and
hand them to nikto with the <tt  >-h file</tt> option. The default port nikto
looks at is port 80. If you want to check out a Web server on some other
port, simply use the <tt  >-p port</tt> option. Tons of extra
options exist in terms of what specific security issues to test for, far
too many
to mention here. See the manual at the project's home
page for more information (<a href="http://cirt.net/nikto2" target="_self">cirt.net/nikto2</a>). 
</p><p>
The hack I cover this month is how to check your own
backyard. Many people will use this kind of knowledge for
nefarious purposes. A utility you can use is chkrootkit. This utility
analyzes your systems and tries to determine whether they've been
tampered with. You can get a list of the tests it can perform with the
<tt  >-l</tt> option. With the standard install on my Ubuntu box, chkrootkit has 69
available tests. You can check things like whether
<tt  >ls</tt> has been infected,
or you can check for evidence of rootkits that may have been installed.
Hopefully, you won't find anything when you run chkrootkit.
</p><p>
Now you have a few new tools you can use to play around with
your networks. Hopefully, you won't find anyone doing anything nasty.
And remember, if you are going to use these tools, be sure
you have permission before you do anything that might be frowned on. Other
than that, hack away and keep learning.

<h2 class="title">Boxee Scores a Knockout</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #199, November 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of my passions is seeking the holy grail of the home-entertainment
center. I've often written about creating the perfect media-center PC,
and I've tried almost every set-top box ever made. They all seem to be
limited in one
area or another&mdash;whether they lack in the playback of local media (Roku
and
PS3) or don't stream on-line content from Hulu and Netflix (XBMC,
ASUS O-Play and GeeXboX).
</p><p>
Enter Boxee. My first experiences with Boxee were not great. I was
disappointed with the interface, it locked up more than not, and its
various media-playing abilities were awkward and hard to navigate.
Recently, however, the Boxee software has matured to the point that
it's a viable and beautiful media center. Although Boxee's Linux version
is unable to play Netflix, due to Netflix's dependence on
Microsoft's Silverlight, the interface's usability will pave
the way for wide acceptance of the Boxee device being built by D-Link
(assuming when it ships it can play Netflix, that is).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10871boxeef1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
My advice is to play with Boxee now, and watch for our review of the
sub-$200 box when it ships. If the software is similar to what
you can download today, we may have a new heavyweight champion!

Back around 2002 PD (Pre-Drupal), the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site ran on PHP-Nuke.
PHP-Nuke is no longer free software, so it seems fitting that there's
a free and open-source CMS for the .NET platform named DotNetNuke (aka DNN).
The DNN Web site claims that DotNetNuke is
&ldquo;The most widely adopted Web Content Management Platform for Microsoft .NET
powering more than 600,000 Web sites.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The open-source version of DNN is known as the community edition.
In addition to the community edition, a number of nonfree versions are
available that
provide extra functionality and technical support.
</p><p>
DNN is extensible via add-on modules.
The community edition includes 25 add-on modules, and there is a
DNN Forge that contains additional modules and skins.
There's also a separate site (<a href="http://snowcovered.com" target="_self">snowcovered.com</a>) that
contains more than
8,000 third-party modules and skins for sale.
</p><p>
DotNetNuke is written in VB.NET, but because it is based on the
.NET platform, any .NET language can be used for writing add-ons
(although VB programmers and C# programmers normally don't hang out together).
There is some indication in the forums that DNN will run on Mono, but
expect a bumpy road if you try.
</p><p>
DotNetNuke is licensed under an MIT License (although in some places
it mentions a BSD license), and licensing and copyright monitoring
is managed actively.

I don't like to take my music collection to work. Don't get me wrong.
I like having access to my Jonathan Coulton and Weird Al Yankovic
albums when I'm troubleshooting servers, but I don't like having my
personal music collection stored on a work computer. It just gives me
the heebie-jeebies. Thankfully, with a broadband Internet connection and
a little bit of work at home, I can stream my personal collection anywhere
I happen to be sitting.
</p><p>
More options probably exist, but the two I generally fiddle
with are kPlaylist and Jinzora. Both have matured during the years,
and both can stream your music collection a number of different ways&mdash;even with a Web-based Flash player in a pinch.
</p><p>
Granted, setting them up can be a little tough, but having your music
collection available anytime and anywhere is worth the effort. In fact,
if you're really a tinkering sort of person, it's possible to get them
to stream your video collection as well. To be fair, your boss might
be a little more annoyed if you're watching your favorite television show
than if you're listening to music, but it's still nice to have the option.

Last month, I mentioned my new Drobo FS, which is a Linux-based NAS device
from the folks at Data Robotics. Although I'm still moderately impressed
with its functionality, I find myself frustrated at its limitations.
Don't get me wrong; if you're just looking for a place to store lots of
data, the Drobo FS is great. Unfortunately, I want a little bit more.
For those of you considering a Drobo FS, or something similar, let me
suggest the following: <span   class="emphasis"><em>build your own</em></span>.
</p><p>
Really, it's not that difficult. What I've done is taken the five 2TB
drives out of the Drobo FS and placed them into a desktop tower.
As long as your desktop's power supply is big enough to handle six
SATA drives and has a gigabit Ethernet port, the setup is fairly simple:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Install your favorite distribution onto a sixth, smaller, SATA drive.
</p></li><li><p>
Create a software RAID5 partition with the five large drives.
</p></li><li><p>
Profit!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Granted, you lose the fancy Drobo mismatched drive ability. Yes,
upgrading storage isn't quite as simple. True, in the event of a
hard-drive failure, you'll have to do a little command-line work, but
just think of the benefits. Any program you want to run on the server
is as easy as an apt-get or yum away. Heck, install a VM system (I'm
using VMware Server), and you even can spin up another operating system
within your SuperNAS!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10871shmobof1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Building your own NAS might not be for everyone, but if you're
reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, perhaps you're the perfect candidate. Be sure
to search LinuxJournal.com for information on software RAID and installing
virtual machines. Chances are, you'll enjoy building your own NAS,
and you even might save some money!

This month's issue is all about hacking, but as we all know too well,
hacking is not always a good thing. Sure, sometimes it can mean
taking apart your Roomba and making a toy for your hamster, or it can
mean finding a creative solution to a technical problem.
Unfortunately, it also can mean violating a secure system and
generally wreaking havoc. Fortunately, LinuxJournal.com has some
valuable information that may help you avoid such a situation. You may
notice an area on the right side of the page with a list of topics we
are particularly interested in. Right now, one of them is security,
and we think you'll find this section incredibly valuable. Here you'll
find a variety of news, tutorials and opinions about what's relevant
in Linux security. Check it out at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/tag/security" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/tag/security</a>, and as always, happy (and
safe) surfing!
