Bruce A. Tate's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</em></span> (Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
In any discipline, the road to true mastery and wisdom requires a
comprehensive view. If programming is the discipline in which you seek
such mastery, crack open Bruce A. Tate's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Languages
in Seven Weeks, A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming
Languages</em></span>.
The book has what publisher Pragmatic Bookshelf calls an &ldquo;audacious
goal&rdquo;, which is to present a meaningful exploration of seven
languages&mdash;namely Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang and
Ruby&mdash;within a single book. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Languages</em></span> covers what's essential
and unique about each language and the most critical programming models
of our time. For each language, readers solve a nontrivial problem,
using techniques that show off the language's most important features,
strengths and weaknesses.

Jothy Rosenberg and Arthur Mateos' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cloud at Your
Service</em></span>
(Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
Jothy Rosenberg and Arthur Mateos' penned the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cloud at Your
Service</em></span> because the market needed a book on cloud computing targeted at
corporate decision-makers. The book, which is subtitled &ldquo;The when, how,
and why of enterprise cloud computing&rdquo;, seeks to inform managers, buyers,
enterprise architects, CIOs and CEOs on the what, when and how of moving
to the cloud. It is the book the authors wished they had when they were
in that role. Cloud-computing-related topics include an introduction,
the business case, private clouds, designing and architecting for scale
and reliability, practical considerations, deployment and operations and
a look into the future of cloud computing.

Symantec's ApplicationHA and VirtualStore</h2></div></div><p>
Symantec recently released two new solutions for VMware
environments&mdash;that is, ApplicationHA and VirtualStore, which the
company says &ldquo;will
enable organizations to virtualize their mission-critical applications
and minimize their storage costs on the VMware platform.&rdquo; Symantec
ApplicationHA, which is based on Veritas Cluster Server technology,
provides high availability for business-critical applications
through application-level visibility and control in VMware
environments. Meanwhile, the Symantec VirtualStore, based on Veritas
Storage Foundation technology, is a software-based storage management
solution for VMware virtual machines that provides rapid provisioning of
servers and virtual desktops, efficient cloning and accelerated bootup
of virtual machines. Both ApplicationHA and VirtualStore are 
integrated seamlessly with VMware management tools, such as VMware vCenter Server,
enabling customers to deploy these tools without impact to their
operational models.

Generation D Consulting's High Availability ASTerisk (HAAST)</h2></div></div><p>
The developers at Generation D have launched High Availability
ASTerisk (HAAST), a software application that allows customers to create
cost-effective Asterisk clusters using any pair of off-the-shelf Linux
boxes. HAAST is a software application that creates a high-availability,
clustered group of Asterisk servers that act as a single server. It
can detect a range of failures on any single Asterisk server and
automatically transfer control to its mate, resulting in a telephony
environment with minimal down time. Key features include rapid failover
(as low as seven seconds), detailed logging, Web interface, extendable API,
intuitive installation and the ability to leverage low-cost hardware
yet achieve a high-availability solution.

Gluster's VMStor</h2></div></div><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em></span> of Gluster's new VMStor is to simplify scalable
NAS for virtual machine storage. Gluster's strategy is eliminating
the requirement to use a traditional storage area network (SAN) based
environment, which can be expensive to scale. Initially supporting
VMware, Gluster VMStor scales to multiple petabytes and can store an
unlimited number of VM images. Key capabilities, such as VM-level
snapshots and backup, can be performed with a single mouse click or
automated with existing tools and cloud management software. Other
features include integration with VMware UI and utilization of standard
NFS filesystem architecture.

Vyatta Network OS</h2></div></div><p>
Vyatta calls the new 6.1 release of Vyatta Network OS a &ldquo;jump
forward&rdquo;
due to advances in IPv6 interoperability, cloud-specific features
and enhanced enterprise security. Vyatta version 6.1 has received
IPv6 Ready Logo Phase 2 certification, verifying the implementation
of IPv6 core routing protocols. For cloud providers and enterprises
moving applications or servers to the cloud, Layer 2 cloud bridging
allows physically separate networks to communicate with each
other over the Internet securely, as if they were on a single Ethernet network.
Regarding security enhancements, Vyatta also has added stateful firewall
failover and enhanced intrusion prevention services through a partnership
with Sourcefire. The upshot, says Vyatta, is that the Vyatta Network OS
makes it &ldquo;even easier for large, distributed organizations to connect,
protect and secure physical, virtual and cloud computing
environments.&rdquo;
