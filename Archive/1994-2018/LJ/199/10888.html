This month, we show you how to create black holes, swallow the Earth in a
cloud of exotic matter, pummel the very fabric of space-time into
nothingness and possibly even divide by zero. If you think you
accidentally picked up a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad Scientist
Monthly</em></span>, fear not. Although
I may have exaggerated the details a bit, it's still an exciting
issue&mdash;the focus is &ldquo;Hack This&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts things off with the notion that knowledge is power
and
provides a list of his favorite books for this year. Although my personal
tastes lean a little more toward science fiction, Reuven has a great list
of resources that should be on every mad scientist's, er, I mean programmer's
shelf. Dave Taylor follows up with a solution to a frustrating problem:
renaming files. It may seem like a simple thing, but anyone who ever has
renamed thousands of files really appreciates the power of scripting. Dave
shows how to do it.
</p><p>
The hacking issue certainly makes a few of us nervous, so security seems a
wise topic to include this month. Mick Bauer helps us feel a bit more at
ease with his continuing series on transparent firewalls. Jes Fraser also
helps us test the security of our Web applications with her article on
Samurai. Because Kyle Rankin just got back from DEF CON, we're all feeling a
bit paranoid ourselves. It's nice that Mick and Jes have our back.
Speaking of Kyle, unlike those Internet bad guys full of secrecy and evil,
he's willing to share his knowledge with the rest of us. This month, he
has a handful of useful hacks he learned while at DEF CON. If you want to
stay off the &ldquo;Wall of Sheep&rdquo;, you'll want to check out his
column.
</p><p>
What hacking issue would be complete without discussing the most complex
fabricated system ever developed in the history of mankind? No, I don't
mean Emacs keybindings, but rather the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,
over in Switzerland. What better way to analyze exotic particles than with
open-source software! Carl Lundstedt takes us behind the scenes at CERN
and shows how the data is getting crunched in that little-black-hole-creation factory.
</p><p>
If the LHC is a little too large for your hacking appetite, and at 17 miles
in circumference, we certainly understand, perhaps Chinavision's Pico
Projector is more your cup of tea. Kyle Rankin not only reviews the tiny
embedded Linux device, but also covers how he hacked it&mdash;and
bricked it. You'll have to read the details for yourself, but it's nice to
see the elite run into trouble from time to time as well. Add to that
Daniel Bartholomew's hack for finding his lost Nokia N900, and we have the
small end of the device-hacking covered along with the big end.
</p><p>
For many of us, hacking is much more about programming than it is about
soldering irons.  Thankfully, Koen Vervloesem shows how to
control our desktops with D-Bus. Whether you want to make applications
talk to each other or tweak the way programs interact with humans, D-Bus
is that back channel you can use to orchestrate the perfect desktop harmony.
If you want to take it further and manipulate your computer remotely with a
smartphone, Jamie Popkin walks through that process as well. 
</p><p>
Things get a little more in-depth as Bryan Childs introduces Rockbox.
Sure, most of us know Rockbox as the alternate operating system for a bunch
of media-playing devices, but what many don't know is that although it's
open source, it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> actually Linux. Why did we print such an
article? Well, we figured this month we'd hack your expectations a bit
too. Anyone interested in Linux will likely be interested in Rockbox.
Check out Bryan's article and see for yourself.
</p><p>
This issue is bound to push you over the edge
from intelligent Linux user to evil genius. At the very least, it will help
prepare you for a battle against the bad guys. We hope you enjoy the Hack
This
issue; we definitely enjoyed putting it together for you.
