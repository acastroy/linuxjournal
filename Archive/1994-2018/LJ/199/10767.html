If you have a Nokia N900, you can set it up so that it helps you find
it the next time you lose it. The methods shown here, with modifications, can be used
on other Linux phones as well.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fa580.0x2af22a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the years, I've misplaced my phone more times than I like to 
admit. Whenever it happens, I get a sinking feeling, much like when I
misplace my keys or pull into the driveway and realize the groceries
are still sitting in the cart...back at the grocery store.
</p><p>
When I notice my phone is missing, I don't automatically assume
it has been stolen. Instead, I know I probably have just set it down
somewhere. If I think it's likely that I left it somewhere other than home, my
first order of business is trying to locate it as quickly as possible
to prevent it from actually being stolen.
</p><p>
Other phone platforms have techniques to help you find your phone,
but they are proprietary, and end users usually have no control over how
they work. There also is the option of &ldquo;bricking&rdquo; your phone, where your
service provider sends a signal to the phone that erases and disables
it. I would rather try everything I can to find my phone before resorting
to that option.
</p><p>
So, how do you go about finding your lost phone? The obvious thing to
do is to try calling it. But, what if the ringer is on silent mode or
the phone is out of earshot? If calling doesn't yield any results,
and you're using a proprietary phone platform, you may need to jump
directly to the bricking option, if that option is open to you.
</p><p>
My current cell phone is a Nokia N900, which was reviewed recently in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (see Kyle Rankin's review in the May 2010
issue). Because the N900 is built on Linux and comes fully unlocked
(with a terminal application and easy root access), you can do some
cool things to find it that you can do on other phones
only by voiding warranties (if you can do them at all).
</p><p>
First, here are a few packages that should be installed:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The rootsh package enables root access to the N900 via the
<tt  >sudo gainroot</tt> command.
</p></li><li><p>
The OpenSSH Client and OpenSSH Server packages.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These are available from the Maemo Extras package repository. To
enable it, launch the App Manager, click on the title bar to bring
up the menu, and select Application catalogs. Select maemo.org (it
might be called Maemo Extras on some phones), uncheck the Disabled
check box, and tap the Save button (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10767f1.large.jpg"><img src="10767f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Settings for the maemo.org Maemo Extras Repository
</p></div></div><p>
If the repository isn't there, you can add it by tapping on the New
button on the Application catalogs screen. The details are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Catalog Name: maemo.org.
</p></li><li><p>
Web address: <a href="http://repository.maemo.org/extras" target="_self">repository.maemo.org/extras</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Distribution: fremantle.
</p></li><li><p>
Components: free, nonfree.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have the repository enabled, tap Download on the
main screen of the Application manager and install the three packages.
</p><p>
With these packages installed, I launched the terminal application on
the N900 and copied over my public SSH key from my desktop, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir .ssh
$ scp me@desktop:.ssh/id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, when my N900 is connected to my home network, I can
<tt  >ssh</tt> in to it from
my desktop without needing a password, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh user@n900.ip.addr.here
</pre>
</p><p>
In theory, I also should be able to <tt  >ssh</tt> to the phone when it is connected
to the cell-phone network; however, my cell-phone provider does not appear
to allow it&mdash;even when I configure alternate ports, all my attempts to log in fail.
</p><p>
Another minor issue is that the SSH d&aelig;mon binds to whatever
network interface is up when it starts, and it won't respond after you
switch between networks because it still is listening on the other
network. To fix this, I created a tiny shell script and placed it at
/etc/network/if-up.d/01_ssh. To create it, I used vi, as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo gainroot
$ vi /etc/network/if-up.d/01_ssh
</pre>
</p><p>
The script itself is only two lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
</pre>
</p><p>
After creating it, I chmodded it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 755 /etc/network/if-up.d/01_ssh
</pre>
</p><p>
Any script in the /etc/network/if-up.d/ folder is run when an interface
is brought up, so when that happens, the SSH d&aelig;mon will be restarted,
and SSH always will be listening on the correct interface.
</p><p>
Now that I have reliable SSH access (when connected to a network other
than the cell network), I can <tt  >ssh</tt> in to the phone, assuming I know the
IP address. At my house, knowing the IP address is easy, because my DHCP
server is configured always to give the N900 the same address whenever
it connects. But when I'm not at home, I might not know, so my first task
is to make sure the N900 tells me what its IP address is. To do this,
I simply add the following to the 01_ssh script I created earlier:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig -a \
    | awk '/inet addr/ { print $2 }' \
    | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' \
        &gt; /tmp/n900.ipaddr
</pre>
</p><p>
This one-line script parses the output of <tt  >ifconfig -a</tt> to extract all
of the IP addresses, and it stores them in a file called N900.ipaddr
in the /tmp/ folder. Then, I add the following line to upload the file
to a special user I created on my home server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/scp -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa \
    /tmp/n900.ipaddr n900user@home.example.net:
</pre>
</p><p>
Prior to setting this up, I needed to generate an SSH key on the N900
with the <tt  >ssh-keygen</tt> command and then copy the .ssh/id_rsa.pub file
into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the unprivileged user I created
to receive the file on my server.
</p><p>
Now every time the N900 goes on-line or connects to a new network, it
uploads the IP address to my home server. Wherever I am, I simply log in
to my server and look in the home folder of my N900 user, and I know what
the current IP address is.
</p><p>
If I can <tt  >ssh</tt> in to my phone, I can make it do several
things.
</p><p>
For one, I can use MPlayer (easily installed from the App manager) to
play a ringtone (or any other supported audio file):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer /home/user/MyDocs/.sounds/Ringtones/OuterSpace.aac
</pre>
</p><p>
This works even if the phone is in silent mode. Speaking of which,
I can turn silent mode off with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=com.nokia.profiled \
     /com/nokia/profiled \
         com.nokia.profiled.set_profile \
             string:"general"
</pre>
</p><p>
With silent mode off, I can try calling the phone again.
</p><p>
One issue that may come up is if I have headphones plugged in. In this
case, it might make more sense for me to vibrate the phone. To make
the phone vibrate, I do this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=com.nokia.mce \
     /com/nokia/mce/request \
         com.nokia.mce.request.req_vibrator_pattern_activate \
             string:PatternIncomingCall
</pre>
</p><p>
The phone vibrates until I shut it off with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=com.nokia.mce \
     /com/nokia/mce/request \
         com.nokia.mce.request.req_vibrator_pattern_deactivate \
             string:PatternIncomingCall
</pre>
</p><p>
If I still can't locate the phone at this point, it's time to get fancy.
</p><p>
The N900 has an accelerometer and a front-facing camera. Both of these
can be triggered from the command line. The camera can be told to take a
picture like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/bin/gst-launch v4l2src \
      device=/dev/video1 \
          num-buffers=1 ! \
          ffmpegcolorspace ! \
          jpegenc ! \
          filesink location=/tmp/front-camera.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
The resulting front-camera.jpg photo then can be uploaded to my server, or some
other device, and I can look at the picture and see whether I can tell from
it where the phone is. Unfortunately, the front camera is a typical cell-phone camera (not very good). If the camera lens is not blocked by
anything, and there is excellent lighting, you might get a decent shot,
but probably not (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10767f2.large.jpg"><img src="10767f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Pictures from the N900 front camera are not the best, but with luck,
they might
help you find the phone. Here I can see that the phone is sitting
somewhere on my desk.
</p></div></div><p>
The accelerometer can tell me whether the phone is moving. I can view the
output with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ watch cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-3/3-001d/coord
</pre>
</p><p>
If the numbers change by a lot every two seconds, the phone is in
motion. If they aren't changing much (or not at all), the phone is
just sitting somewhere.
</p><p>
One thing that might help at this point is to have the phone call me
so I can listen in on what is going on where the phone is. To have the
phone call me, I do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --system --dest=com.nokia.csd.Call \
      --type=method_call \
      --print-reply /com/nokia/csd/call \
          com.nokia.csd.Call.CreateWith \
              string:"3215551212" \
              uint32:0
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >3215551212</tt> should be replaced with the phone number to call. If I
left the phone in a place with a distinctive sound (like a movie theater
or coffee shop), I might be able to tell where it is sitting.
</p><p>
If I still can't figure it out, it's time to check the GPS. I saved
this method until now because it requires a Python library that is 
available only in the maemo.org extras-devel repository. extras-devel is a
repository for developers, and it contains a lot of packages that aren't
quite ready for general consumption (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10767f3.large.jpg"><img src="10767f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Settings for the extras-devel Repository
</p></div></div><p>
To enable extras-devel, follow the instructions at
<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel" target="_self">wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel</a> (see the &ldquo;How to
activate Extras-devel&rdquo;
section).
</p><p>
Once the repository is enabled, I install the python-location package, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo gainroot
$ apt-get install python-location
</pre>
</p><p>
After installing the package, I disabled the extras-devel repository
so that I didn't accidentally upgrade any of my stable software with
potentially unstable versions. I do this by opening the App manager
application, clicking on the title bar and choosing Application
catalogs. Then I tap on the extras-devel entry I created earlier, select
the Disabled check box and click Save. I also could have
just deleted it, but I decided to save it for later, just in case.
</p><p>
With the python-location package installed, I now could talk to the GPS
using Python. There was only one problem with that plan. I don't know
Python. It's been on my list of &ldquo;Languages to Learn&rdquo; for a long time
now, and I promise I'll learn it one day, but the mythical &ldquo;one
day&rdquo;
hasn't arrived yet.
</p><p>
Thankfully, an N900 user who knew Python
wrote a script that did exactly what I needed:
<a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=566224&amp;postcount=1" target="_self">talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=566224&amp;postcount=1</a>. The script is
toward the bottom of the post. Apart from the script, the post contains
many helpful ideas for recovering an N900 (many similar to what I
described here), and it is well worth a read. Run the script like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python gps.py
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming the phone is in a place where it can get a GPS fix, it will
output the phone's latitude and longitude. You can enter those coordinates 
into Google Maps (or any other mapping tool that lets you
input latitude and longitude), and you easily can see where the phone is
to within a few feet.
</p><p>
There is one problem with all of the above techniques. They all rely
on the phone being accessible via SSH. As I stated earlier, my service
provider blocks me from logging in when the phone is connected to the cell
network. Additionally, any time my phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network,
it is behind a router, which also blocks me from logging in using SSH.
</p><p>
The way around this is to make the phone perform as many of the above
actions as it can without me telling it to.
</p><p>
The first problem to solve is how to let the phone know
that it is lost. I could do this by putting a
specially named file on a public Web server. An example would be
http://example.net/~me/my-n900-is-lost.txt. For security reasons, this file should
have a name that is hard to guess (so don't use my example).
</p><p>
If I make the phone try to <tt  >wget</tt> the file, and it succeeds, the phone
will know it is lost and can try to tell me where it is. If the phone
tries to <tt  >wget</tt> the file and fails, it will know that it
is not lost (in my case, at least not yet).
</p><p>
Then, the trick is how to make the N900 periodically check to see whether
it is lost. On a regular Linux machine, I would do this with
cron, but the N900 doesn't have cron (battery life is the reason). The
N900 does have an alarm d&aelig;mon, but interfacing with it requires Python
knowledge. A few projects are in the works that are trying to
bring cron-like functionality to the N900, but they're not quite ready
(at the time of this writing) for public consumption.
</p><p>
I did find one package that works
well enough as a stopgap until other solutions mature. It's called
dbus-scripts, and it is a dbus-monitoring d&aelig;mon that allows you to
execute scripts when certain things happen on the N900. Like the
python-location package, dbus-scripts is available (at the time of this
writing)
only in the extras-devel repository. After re-enabling the repository,
I installed the package, along with a GUI configuration program, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo gainroot
$ apt-get install dbus-scripts dbus-scripts-settings
</pre>
</p><p>
After installing the packages, I disabled extras-devel again. The GUI
took some of the trial and error out of configuring the triggers,
so I recommend it (Figure 4).
I put the commands I wanted to execute into a
shell script called lost.sh and then set up the triggers in the
/etc/dbus-scripts.d/dbus-scripts-settings file (Listing 1).

</pre></div><p>
I decided it would make the most sense to watch for three different
actions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The phone changing networks.
</p></li><li><p>
The keyboard being opened or closed.
</p></li><li><p>
Low power.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If the network changes, that probably means the phone is on the
move (maybe I left it in a car). If the keyboard is opened or closed,
someone is using or looking at the phone. Finally, if the phone
is just sitting there, eventually the batteries will drain away (and
I'd like to find the phone before all power is gone).
</p><p>
The three lines in dbus-scripts-settings that watch for those actions are the
following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/user/lost.sh * * com.nokia.icd * * * CONNECTED
/home/user/lost.sh * * org.freedesktop.Hal.Device \
                           Condition ButtonPressed cover
/home/user/lost.sh * * com.nokia.bme.signal battery_low
</pre>
</p><p>
The lost.sh script is called each time one of those events occurs. The
dbus-scripts Wiki page (<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/DbusScripts" target="_self">wiki.maemo.org/DbusScripts</a>) has more
information on formatting the configuration lines.
</p><p>
See the lost.sh script (Listing 1) for details of what it does. One thing I found
in testing is that some of the commands I can run on the command
line do not work at all when called from a script by the dbus-scripts
d&aelig;mon. These include the mplayer command and setting the phone to
nonsilent mode. Thankfully, other commands work fine when called from
the script.
</p><p>
The final piece of the puzzle was getting the N900 to send at least some
of the data it gathered to another phone via SMS. I found a good Python
script for sending SMS messages at
<a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=558430&amp;postcount=57" target="_self">talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=558430&amp;postcount=57</a>.
</p><p>
With the SMS script in place and called by the lost.sh script, all I
have to do is create the special file on my Web server, and suddenly my
N900 starts sending my designated backup phone (my wife's cell phone)
SMS messages whenever one of the events I configured happens.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fa580.0x2eed990"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
My current setup is not perfect. The main problem is that if the phone
is sitting somewhere not changing networks and not being used, it might
be several hours before the low-battery warning event happens and the
phone discovers it is lost. As soon as one of the cron alternatives
is ready, I probably will switch to using that and have the phone check
every half hour to see if it is lost.
</p><p>
Also, the scripts I've created so far are pretty rough. With some more
hacking, this will improve. But even in their current state, although they
may not guarantee I will recover my lost or stolen phone, they will give
me a better chance.
</p><p>
Finally, I don't know if there's any way for me to prevent myself from
setting my phone down and forgetting about it. As much as I tell myself
it will not happen, I know that someday it will. Thanks to the openness
of the N900, I can do things other phones can only dream about.
