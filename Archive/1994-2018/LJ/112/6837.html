With fine-grained mandatory access controls in your
system, you can even put limits on what root can do.

NSA Security Enhanced Linux has its roots
in the distributed trusted operating system
(DTOS) and Flask (Flux advanced security kernel)
architecture. The DTOS Project was a collaborative
effort between the US National Security
Agency (NSA) and Secure Computing Corporation
(SCC) in the early and mid-1990s. The goal was
to provide stronger operating system security mechanisms
than those provided by
standard security methods. The Flask
architecture was the result of a joint effort
between the NSA, SCC and the University of
Utah's Flux Project, which was &ldquo;enhanced to
provide better support for dynamic security
policies&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/flask" target="_self">www.cs.utah.edu/flux/flask</a>,
&ldquo;Flask: Flux Advanced Security Kernel&rdquo; by Stephen
Smalley, NAI Labs, December 26, 2000).
</p><p>
SE Linux implements mandatory access control, or
MAC, while regular UNIX systems employ discretionary
access control, or DAC. With DAC, users can control what access is applied to
objects they own at their discretion. On a
UNIX system, for example, they can use the chmod
command to change permissions on directories they
own. With MAC, access control is decided by a
more authoritative user who configures security
policies that determine what access rights an
object possesses. If a policy is preventing
Bob from accessing Alice's home directory, and
Alice runs <tt  >chmod 777</tt> on her home directory, Bob
still would not be able to access it.
</p><p>
When utilizing
MAC, processes are run with a minimum amount
of privilege, and a compromised process cannot
grant other processes inappropriate access to its
own resources. This reduces the amount of damage
that might occur if a d&aelig;mon was compromised.
Security decisions are based on a
number of factors, such as the role of the user,
what type of program is being run, how trusted that
program is and the secrecy level or integrity of
the data being accessed.

What Is SE Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
SE Linux is an implementation of flexible,
fine-grained mandatory access controls in the
Linux kernel that is now implemented using the
LSM framework (see &ldquo;Using the Kernel Security
Module Interface&rdquo; by Greg Kroah-Hartman, <i  >LJ</i>, November 2002).
In its current implementation,
the LSM interface supports only restrictive
access controls. Therefore, if the standard UNIX
permissions deny an operation, SE Linux
cannot permit it. SE Linux generally is used to
apply additional restrictions to a system that
employs UNIX permissions, and it is quite capable
of enforcing all necessary access controls
on its own. However, it is strongly recommended that
a combination of UNIX permissions and SE Linux
be used for &ldquo;defense in depth&rdquo; on production
servers. SE Linux is comprised of a kernel patch
and patches to utility programs such as
login and cron.
</p><p>
The NSA is responsible for official
releases. A number of other people
outside the NSA also contribute code to the
project. Packages are maintained constantly for the
Debian stable and unstable releases. As SE Linux is
licensed under the GPL, anyone can contribute and
make her own modifications. SE Linux can be used
on 2.4.19 kernels and above, and at the time of
this writing, May 2003, it is being redeveloped for the 2.5 kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6b580.0xd637c0"></a>
Why Are Modified Utilities Required?</h2></div></div><p>
As previously mentioned, SE Linux is comprised of
a kernel patch and modified utility programs. The
modified utilities ensure that all files on
the system
possess the correct security context.
Modified versions of utilities, such as login, cron and
logrotate, and programs, such as ps and ls, are available. With
login, for example, it is crucial to have the
correct security contexts when a user logs in
to the system. If not, he might not be able
to log in at all.
</p><p>
Installing the login package
is covered in the Getting Started with SE Linux
HOWTO (see Resources) and is
beyond the scope of this article. Forgetting to
install the login package during the SE Linux
installation, however, results in not having the
right type assigned to the terminal device from which you
are logging in after a reboot, which renders
you unable to log in. An unmodified login program
also runs a shell in a security context that
is denied access to files in the user's home
directory. The patches for login and cron, for
example, tell the kernel which security
context to use. The actual enforcement of these measures
is done by the kernel. Labeling is imperative, hence the need for some modified programs. It is
possible to create your own security policies that
provide basic levels of protection without having to
to install modified packages, but the default
configuration provides finer-grained security.

Frequently Used Terms</h2></div></div><p>
When reading documents on SE Linux or mailing list
posts, the following terms always are used. It
is important to familiarize yourself with them as
much as possible before you attempt to install SE
Linux. Doing so makes things much easier later on.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Domain</em></span>: a domain details what processes can
and cannot do or, rather, what actions a process can perform on various
types. If you are in the user_t domain (the standard unprivileged user
domain) and you run the command <tt  >ps aux</tt>, you see only the processes
running in the user_t domain. Some examples of domains are
sysadm_t, the system administration domain, and init_t,
the domain in which init runs. The domain in which the passwd program
is run by an unprivileged user is passwd_t.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Role</em></span>: a role determines what domains can
be used. The domains that a user role can access are predefined in the
policy database. If a role is not authorized to enter a domain (in the
config files), it is denied. Some examples of roles are the
general unprivileged user role (user_r) and the system administrator role
(sysadm_r).
</p><p>
Consider the following example: in order for
a user from the user_t domain to execute the passwd command,
<tt  >role user_r types passwd_t ;</tt>
is specified in the relevant config file.
In addition, other domain transitioning
rules must be set that are not covered here.
This added code states that a user in the user role (user_r)
is allowed to enter the passwd_t domain, so he
can run the passwd command. Another consideration
is whether the old domain is allowed to
transition to the new domain.
</p><p>
Now that we have defined domains and roles, we can
look at comparisons between SE Linux and the standard UNIX uid (user ID). If
root owns a program with UNIX permissions 4777
(making the program setuid root), any user on
the system can execute that program, resulting in a
security issue. With SE Linux, however, if
a process triggers a domain transition to
a privileged domain and the role of the process
is not authorized to enter a particular domain,
the program cannot be run. Every process on an SE
Linux system runs in a domain that determines
what access rights a process possesses.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Identity</em></span>: an identity under SE Linux is not
the same as the traditional UNIX uid with which most readers
might be
familiar. Identities under SE Linux form part of a security context
that controls what you can and cannot do. An SE Linux identity and a
regular UNIX login name may have the same textual representation (and in
most cases they do for ease of use), but it is important to understand
that they are two different beings. The default is to have them be the same,
if the SE Linux identity in question exists. Therefore, if I log in as user
faye on an SE Linux system, and if the policy database has the identity
faye compiled into it, then my processes would be assigned to the
faye identity.
</p><p>
To illustrate that standard UNIX user IDs are different from SE
Linux identities, consider the su command. Running
<tt  >su</tt> does
not change the user identity under SE Linux, but it does change the uid
in the same way it would on a non-SE Linux system. If user faye, on
the SE Linux system, types <tt  >su -</tt> to switch to root
and then runs the <tt  >id</tt>
command, which returns her security context and other
information, she would see that her identity still is faye and not
root, but her uid has changed. To illustrate this further, if an
unprivileged user with the login name faye runs the
<tt  >id</tt> command, she would
see the security context of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uid=1000(faye) gid=1000(faye)
groups=1000(faye) context=faye:user_r:user_t
sid=45
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6b580.0xd64000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The identity portion of the security context in
this case is faye. Notice the uid of 1000. Next, say faye does an
<tt  >su</tt>
to root and runs the <tt  >id</tt> command again; she
now would see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
context=faye:user_r:user_t sid=453
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6b580.0xd64210"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The identity has not changed to
root as might be expected, but the uid has changed
to 0. However, if user faye has been granted
access to enter the superuser role, or sysadm_r,
she can do so by either logging in at the console
and specifying she wants the superuser role or
entering the <tt  >newrole -r</tt> command
covered later. If she then runs the id command
again, she now sees
<tt  >context=3Dfaye:sysadm_r:sysadm_t</tt>.
</p><p>
So again, the identity remains the same, but
the role and domain (second and third fields,
respectively) have changed. Maintaining the
identity in this manner is useful where user
accountability is required. It also is crucial
to system security because the user identity
determines what roles and domains can be used. With
regular UNIX, if you have a setuid or setgid
program that is not world-executable, whether it
is executed is determined not by the permissions
of the user you are logged in as, but by the user
you last did an <tt  >su</tt> to reach. This restriction does not exist under SE
Linux, as your identity is tracked throughout all
operations. If your domain has not been granted
the access to execute that setuid/setgid program,
you cannot run it even if you did an <tt  >su</tt>
to root. The domains you are permitted to enter
are determined by your role, and the roles you
are permitted to enter are determined by your
identity. Thus, identity indirectly controls the
list of domains you may enter.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Type</em></span>: each object has a type assigned to it,
and that type determines what can access the object. Objects here are
files, directories, sockets and other processes. A type is similar in
concept to a domain, the difference being that a domain applies
only to processes. More specifically, a domain is a type that can be applied to a process.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Transition</em></span>: a transition refers to the change
in security context for a requested operation. Transitions fall into
one of two categories. The first category is a transition of process
domains. When you execute a program of a given type, a transition may be
made from the current domain of the process to a new domain. To illustrate
this, I'll use the newrole command. The newrole command is used to change
your role, say, from user_r to sysadm_r, assuming you have been granted
access to sysadm_r. If you start off as user_r, the general
unprivileged user role, and run <tt  >newrole -r
sysadm_r</tt>
to change to sysadm_r, the system administrator role, a transition
is made from your user_t domain to newrole_t (the domain in which the newrole
process runs) and from there on to the sysadm_t domain.
</p><p>
The second transition category is the transition
of file type when you create a file under a
particular directory. If a user creates a file
in his own home directory, that file is
labeled as user_home_t. But if that same user
creates a file in /tmp, that file is labeled
user_tmp_t. user_tmp_t is derived from the
type of /tmp, which is tmp_t, and the domain of
the creating process, which is user_t. When the
user creates a file under /tmp, a transition to
the user_tmp_t type is made.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Policies</em></span>: a policy determines what actions can be taken on
various types by various domains. All d&aelig;mons have their own policies,
and the naming convention is of the form
<span   class="emphasis"><em>d&aelig;mon-name</em></span>.te&mdash;postfix.te,
apache.te and so forth. As the system administrator of an SE Linux
machine, you can edit your policy files to suit your requirements. The
policy database is a compiled form of the policy source files and is
loaded by the kernel at boot time.
</p><p>
The spasswd program on an SE Linux system is
used to change your password. spasswd actually is
a wrapper for the standard passwd command used on
Linux systems; it ensures that the passwd program
is run in the correct domain. It also ensures
that your SE Linux identity matches your regular
UNIX account name. Earlier I mentioned that
regular UNIX user IDs are quite different from
SE Linux identities, so why do they have to
match when running spasswd? spasswd requires you
to have the same SE Linux identity name as your
UNIX account name. Recall that on an SE Linux
system, your identity is the only unique method of
determining who you are. So if you're not currently
the corresponding UNIX user, you cannot
change the password.
</p><p>
If you are the system administrator user
(sysadm_r), the sadminpasswd program is used to
change the password of another user. sadminpasswd
does not have the same matching user name/identity
restriction that spasswd has, but sadminpasswd can
be run only by sysadm_t.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6b580.0xd64948"></a>
Permissive and Enforcing Modes</h2></div></div><p>
SE Linux can be run in one of two modes,
permissive or enforcing. Permissive mode is
used for debugging purposes as everything
gets logged, but SE Linux is not actually
enforcing your policies. You still can do
things as root that you could do on a regular
Linux system. It is best to run your machine in
permissive mode until you are satisfied that all
your policies are correct. Labels are assigned to
objects on the system, but nothing is enforced.
</p><p>
Enforcing mode applies the policies you have
configured, such as access restrictions. You should
boot in to enforcing mode only when you are
convinced that everything is working properly, after
running in permissive mode for a while.
Remember, if your kernel is compiled
with no development support, you cannot specify
permissive mode. If your kernel is compiled with
development mode support turned on, it means
that your machine boots into permissive mode,
but you have to switch it to enforcing
mode manually. This can be done easily by creating a
startup script.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can make a link
between /etc/rc.boot/avc and /sbin/avc_toggle. Another
option is to specify <tt  >enforcing=1</tt> on the kernel
command line. The avc_toggle command can be used
to switch between permissive and enforcing mode,
and the avc_enforcing command can be used to
determine whether you are in enforcing mode.

Where to Go from Here</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully this article has you interested in
trying out SE Linux. I have omitted
installation instructions deliberately, as you can install with
RPMs, source tarballs or Debian packages.
Including even the basics of each here would fill an entire
article. There's quite a lot to learn before,
during and after installation, and new users often
find themselves rather confused. If you read the
documents referred to in the Resources section before you do anything else
and become familiar with frequently used terms,
you should find it a little easier. If you
get stuck, fire up your favorite IRC client and
go over to channel #selinux on <a href="http://irc.debian.org" target="_self">irc.debian.org</a>,
or subscribe to the SE Linux mailing list.
