Every content management system requires
extensive customization. Start with one that has
the power to make your web site work the way your
organization does.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1989348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Over the last few months, we have discussed content management systems
(CMS)
in general and Zope's content management framework (CMF) in
particular. Zope's CMF is designed to give developers the tools
they need to create their own content management systems. Of course, anyone
who has worked with a CMS knows that
even the most proprietary of the bunch requires extensive modification,
reworking and customization before it can be used. Zope thus not
only reduces the price of the base software, but provides a rich
environment that makes it relatively easy to develop and customize the
CMS.
</p><p>
When you create a CMF site, you (as the site manager) can add, modify
and delete documents. Click on the folder contents link, click
on the New... button, indicate which type of document you want to
add and what ID it should have and then click on the add button.
Enter the metadata (that is, title, description, subject and
content type), click on the change &amp; edit button, add some content
and you're off and running.
</p><p>
However, although the existing content types are sufficient for simple sites,
more sophisticated sites will want to create their own, custom types.
CMF provides several ways to do exactly this.
This month, we look at types in CMF&mdash;how we can work with them,
customize their behavior, install new ones and even create new types
to handle custom content.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1989500"></a>CMF Types</h2></div></div><p>
The simplest way to create a new type is to use CMF's built-in,
Web-based type extension system. It allows you to create a new type
that shares its methods, properties, actions, presentation templates
and icons with another type by default. When you create a new type
using the Web-based extension system, you can modify any of these items,
except for the methods and properties. In other words, the new type
you create can have a different look and feel from its parent
type, but it continues to behave much as the parent did.
</p><p>
For example, let's go to what is known as the types tool, available
by clicking on portal_types within the management interface for a
CMF site. If you don't have a CMF site already defined in Zope, you
can create one by choosing CMF Site from the Add... menu in
the upper-right corner of the Web-based Zope management interface.
Once you have created the site, clicking on its icon from within the
management interface displays a number of different customization
tools, each with an icon that looks like a wrench.
</p><p>
When you first enter the types tool, you see a list of the currently
defined CMF types, including folders, documents, news items, links
and topics. You can examine and modify the properties and actions
associated with these types by clicking on the name of the type you
want to change. For example, if you want to examine or change the way the File
content type does things, click on File. This brings up a new
set of management tabs at the top of the page, with properties (the
default) and actions being the only ones not standard to
other parts of Zope. Actually, properties is a standard Zope tab,
but CMF types have a number of unusual property names.
</p><p>
In addition to the standard properties you expect to see,
each type has the following properties that affect
what it does:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Icon: a string that describes which icon should be displayed for items of this type.
</p></li><li><p>Product metatype: describes the Zope product meta-name.
Meta-names are used in the Add... menu in the Zope Management
Interface. This also is the name used in the similar Add... menu
in the CMF.
</p></li><li><p>
Product name: indicates the Zope product in which the CMF type
was defined. Because both the File and News item types were
defined in the default CMF installation, they are listed as being in
the CMFDefault product. And indeed, if you look in
/lib/python/products/CMFDefault, which is a symbolic link to
CMF-1.3/CMFDefault in CMF 1.3, you should see both File.py and
NewsItem.py, Python modules that define the content types. To see
how the initial values for properties are set, look at the
factory_type_information variable in any module for any defined
CMF type.
</p></li><li><p>
Product factory method: describes the method CMF should
invoke to create a new instance of the type.
</p></li><li><p>
Filter content types and Allowed content types: these work together,
even though they are separate properties. Although both of these
properties exist for all CMF types, they are relevant only for folder-like
objects, such as Folders and Topics. The first, Filter content types,
is a boolean value that indicates whether Allowed content types is
active. The second, Allow content types, lets you specify which types
may be contained within the current type. So if you were interested in
creating a folder that would contain only News items, you could do so by
clicking yes and then indicating which types may be included.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1989ad8"></a>
Creating a New Type</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest way to create a new CMF type is to base it on an existing
type with the Web-based CMF type creation tool. This method does not
allow you to modify the fields or methods associated with a type, but
it does let you change the permissions associated with the type's
actions, whether the type can be discussed and even the way in which
this data type is displayed.
</p><p>
For example, go to the portal_types tool and choose
Factory-based type information from the Select type to add...
menu in the top-right corner. You are prompted for two pieces of
information, the ID or name of the new type and the
existing type on which it should be based. We are creating the
ATFDocument, which means we are basing ourselves on CMF
Default: Document.
</p><p>
Once you create the new type, it is available and visible from
all of the type listings, including the types tool and the
contents view in which you create a new instance of a type. Indeed,
anyone with administrative privileges on the portal can now see your
new ATFDocument type in the menu of options from which they can choose
a new type to create.
</p><p>
What's the point of doing this, if ATFDocument and Document are the
same? Well, they're not exactly the same; rather, they share
methods and an overall class definition. Other information about this
type, such as properties, permissions and skins, default to be the
same as Document, but they can be made to look quite different. This means that if you
want instances of Document to be displayed in black-on-white text
without discussions and ATFDocument to be displayed in
yellow-on-maroon text with discussions, you can do that quickly and
easily with this method. And, if and when you upgrade your copy of
CMF, ATFDocument will be updated automatically, along with Document.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1989d40"></a>
Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, there will be times when you want to create a type that
has fields or behavior significantly different from an existing
type. Several options exist for doing this, but the most flexible (and
challenging and poorly documented) method is to create a new Zope
product that adheres to CMF rules. For example, all Python packages must
contain an __init__.py file in
the package's root directory. This file may be empty, or it may
contain statements that are evaluated when the package is first loaded
into memory. In the case of a product, __init__.py is where the class
is first registered into Zope by use of the initialize() method, which
takes a single argument commonly called context. A bare-bones Zope
product thus has an __init__.py that looks something like the
following mythical MyProduct:

<pre     class="screen">

import MyProduct

def initialize(context):
  context.registerClass(
    MyProduct.MyProduct,
    constructors=(MyProduct.manage_addMyProductForm,
                  MyProduct.manage_addMyProduct)
    )


</pre>
</p><p>
When Zope starts up, it looks through the products and invokes the
initialize() method with an appropriate context. Context is part of
Zope's system of acquisition, in which an object's attributes are
defined by its location in the hierarchy as well as by its class
definition. In the above example, MyProduct registers itself with
two constructors, the methods manage_addMyProductForm and
manage_addMyProduct.
</p><p>



A CMF type must register itself not only with Zope but also with CMF,
so it can appear in the various CMF tools. Our product's
initialize() method thus needs to include CMF-specific
registration, which means that __init__.py needs to import modules
from CMF. Moreover, every type in CMF must register itself with one
of the CMF-specific initialization routines in Products.CMFCore.utils.
For example, __init__.py from CMFDefault, which comes with CMF, first
defines the different classes it will register:

<pre     class="screen">
contentClasses = ( Document.Document
                 , File.File
                 , Image.Image
                 , Link.Link
                 , Favorite.Favorite
                 , NewsItem.NewsItem
                 , SkinnedFolder.SkinnedFolder
)

</pre>
</p><p>
It then defines the constructor for each of the classes:

<pre     class="screen">
contentConstructors = \
    ( Document.addDocument
    , File.addFile
    , Image.addImage
    , Link.addLink
    , Favorite.addFavorite
    , NewsItem.addNewsItem
    , SkinnedFolder.addSkinnedFolder
)
</pre>
</p><p>
And, of course, every type can have its own specific tool:

<pre     class="screen">
tools = ( DiscussionTool.DiscussionTool
        , MembershipTool.MembershipTool
        , RegistrationTool.RegistrationTool
        , PropertiesTool.PropertiesTool
        , URLTool.URLTool
        , MetadataTool.MetadataTool
        , SyndicationTool.SyndicationTool
)
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, the initialize() method, abbreviated slightly here, within
the package registers these classes using CMF with utils.ToolInit(), for
tools, or ContentInit, for content. It then invokes
initialize(context) on what it receives back, thus registering the new
object with Zope:

<pre     class="screen">

def initialize( context ):

   utils.ToolInit('CMFDefault Tool', tools=tools,
                  product_name='CMFDefault',
                  icon='tool.gif',
                  ).initialize( context )

   utils.ContentInit( 'CMFDefault Content'
            , content_types=contentClasses
            , permission=AddPortalContent
            , extra_constructors=contentConstructors
            , fti=Portal.factory_type_information
            ).initialize( context )

   context.registerClass(Portal.CMFSite,
         constructors=(Portal.manage_addCMFSiteForm,
                       Portal.manage_addCMFSite,
                       ))

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The final statement in the above version of initialize(), as you can
see, is similar to the final statement in the version of initialize()
from the sample MyProduct(), demonstrating that CMF types are Zope
products, only with some extra hooks included.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a370"></a>
Should You Use CMF?</h2></div></div><p>
This article concludes our look at Zope as a platform for content
management, which began with Plone and concluded with CMF and CMF
types. Now that we've looked at CMF in a bit more detail, let's
consider whether it is worth using for projects that require a CMS.
</p><p>
The good news is that CMF is a powerful and flexible system.
In the hands of a skilled and knowledgeable developer,
CMF makes it possible to produce a custom CMS with lower cost and
greater flexibility than the proprietary systems now on the market.
The fact that everything is built on top of Zope, which is designed
for rapid development, makes it quick and easy to create new types,
modify templates and develop functionality.
</p><p>
But CMF, like much open-source software, suffers from a terrible lack
of up-to-date and useful documentation. I'm sure that one of
the reasons for the success of the Plone CMS is the excellent documentation that comes with Plone.
</p><p>
So if you're going to use CMF, be ready and willing to
read through a great deal of Python code, to experiment quite a bit
and to ask other CMF developers for help. Given the central role that
CMF already is playing in the Zope world already, I expect that the amount and
quality of CMF documentation will continue to increase. But until it
does, working with CMF will require patience, reading the
source code and a lot of trial and error.
</p><p>
The current state of the CMF is such that I would be somewhat hesitant
to use it for anything but the largest and most complex
content management systems. That said, the flexibility and power of
the CMF is designed to solve problems of precisely this magnitude. In
short, as inappropriate as CMF might be for small jobs, it
probably is quite appropriate for large ones. And as time goes on, I
expect CMF to play an increasingly prominent role in the world of
open-source content management, providing a framework for the rapid
development of custom CMS software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a630"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Zope's CMF is an impressive framework for building a custom CMS.
I have no doubt
that CMF makes it easy to create a CMS, at a significantly lower
cost and with far less effort than would be the case with a
full-fledged proprietary solution. That said, CMF still is not quite
ready for prime time for anyone who is not intimately familiar with it
or willing to spend a great deal of time learning it. I would argue that Plone has pushed CMF into the spotlight, and the
fact that Zope 3 will be largely or completely merged with CMF means
there is now greater incentive at Zope Corporation to make CMF
more impressive and better-documented than was previously the case.
</p><p>
If you have a fair amount of programming experience with Python and
Zope, you almost certainly can use CMF to create your own custom
types as Zope products&mdash;and with those, create impressive,
interesting sites for yourself and your clients. However, until the
type-creation system becomes easier to understand, CMF will not get
the attention it deserves from outside the Zope community.
Creating Zope products is no longer the black art that it used to be,
and I expect that creating CMF types will be treated similarly in the
near future.
</p><p>
Next month, we will shift gears dramatically, looking at another
open-source CMS known as Bricolage. Bricolage, which uses Mason,
mod_perl and PostgreSQL, has gained a great deal of ground in
the past year, and it is an increasingly prominent player in the
open-source CMS community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a7e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for Zope CMF is <a href="http://cmf.zope.org" target="_self">cmf.zope.org</a>. I not only found the site difficult to
navigate, but I could not easily find good, useful information on CMF.
</p><p>
The best introduction to CMF types I found was not actually on
the CMF site but on the Plone site, at <a href="http://www.plone.org" target="_self">www.plone.org</a>. For
example, the document at
<a href="http://plone.org/documentation/CMFTypesBook/backtalk_book_view" target="_self">plone.org/documentation/CMFTypesBook/backtalk_book_view</a> is
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>CMF Types Book</em></span>, which is both readable and contains examples.
Chapter 8 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Plone Book</em></span> also contains some good information about
CMF types, at <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/book/8" target="_self">plone.org/documentation/book/8</a>.
</p><p>
As always, ZopeLabs, at <a href="http://www.zopelabs.com" target="_self">www.zopelabs.com</a>, has a good amount
of sample code and minitutorials describing how to accomplish certain
tasks in CMF.
</p><p>
Finally, if you are interested in creating new types for CMF, consider
Archetypes, a SourceForge project designed to make it easier for
people to create new CMF types. And indeed, the CMF Collective is a
SourceForge project containing a number of CMF types that might
interest you. Be sure to look through the CVS repository, rather than
depending on the files and types that have been made available on
SourceForge.
