More necessary instructions for making your new device driver
play nice in the 2.6 kernel.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2726240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the last Driving Me Nuts column [see <i  >LJ</i>, June 2003], we introduced the kernel driver model
framework with an explanation of how the generic bus and
driver and device code works. The i2c core was used as an
example to show how these different subsystems work. This month,
we cover how the driver class code works, again
using the i2c code to provide some working examples.
</p><p>
As discussed in the last column, device classes do not meet the general
object-oriented definition of a class; rather they are
something that provides a single type of function to the user.
For example, kernel classes are used for tty devices, block
devices, network devices, SCSI hosts and, in the near future,
filesystems.
</p><p>
In the 2.5.69 kernel, the driver class support was rewritten radically. In previous kernel versions, class support was
tied tightly to the driver and device support. A class would be
bound to the device at the same time it was registered to a driver.
This did work for a number of devices and classes, but some
real-world devices did not fit very well into this model.
Now, class support is tied only loosely to devices and
drivers; in fact, a device or driver is not even needed to use
the class code now, as the tty class code shows.
The class code is now split into three different types of
structures: classes, class devices and class interfaces.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2726450"></a>Classes</h2></div></div><p>
Classes in the kernel are defined with a simple
struct class structure. Yes,
class is not a reserved word in C. (Everyone
who wants to build a kernel with a C++ compiler, go flame
the author of the new class code.) To create a class
structure, only the name variable in the
struct class structure needs to be defined
for it to be a valid class. This can be done with the
following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static struct class i2c_adapter_class = {
	.name = "i2c_adapter"
};

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x27265b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
After the class structure is defined, it can be registered with
the driver core by calling the
class_register function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (class_register(&amp;i2c_adapter_class) != 0)
    printk(KERN_ERR "i2c adapter class failed "
                    "to register properly\n");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2726710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
After the class_register function returns
without reporting an error, the
/sys/class/i2c_adapter directory has
been created successfully. Later, when the class needs to be unloaded, the
class_unregister function should be called:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class_unregister(&amp;i2c_adapter_class);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2726870"></a>Class Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Classes are used to manage a set of different class devices. A
class device is defined in the kernel with the
struct	class_device structure. This
structure contains of a lot of variables the driver core uses,
and it can be ignored by the driver writer. Only the following
variables should be set:

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
class: should point to the
struct class that is going to manage
the class device.
</p></li><li><p>
dev: should be set to the address of the
struct device associated with the class device, if any. A single struct device can be pointed to by
multiple class device structures. This is the main
difference between the previous kernel class support
and the current implementation. This variable does not
have to be set for the kernel to work properly. If it
is set, a device symbolic link
is created in the sysfs entry for the class device
that points to the struct device.
See below for an example.
</p></li><li><p>
class_id: an array of characters used to
describe the class device. It must be unique among all
class device structures assigned to a single class
structure.
</p></li><li><p>
class_data: used to store a pointer to any private
data the class driver wants to associate with the class device. This
variable should not be accessed directly, but the class_set_devdata
and class_get_devdata functions
should be used to set and retrieve the value of this
variable.
</p></li></ul></div>
</p><p>
To register a properly set up
struct class_device structure, the
class_device_register function should be
called. An example of how to initialize a
struct class_device and register it with the
driver core can be seen in the following code from the
drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* Add this adapter to the i2c_adapter class */
memset(&amp;adap-&gt;class_dev, 0x00,
       sizeof(struct class_device));
adap-&gt;class_dev.dev = &amp;adap-&gt;dev;
adap-&gt;class_dev.class = &amp;i2c_adapter_class;
strncpy(adap-&gt;class_dev.class_id,
        adap-&gt;dev.bus_id, BUS_ID_SIZE);
class_device_register(&amp;adap-&gt;class_dev);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2726d40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
First, the struct class_device variable
(embedded in the struct i2c_adapter
variable) is initialized to zero. All driver model structures
need to have all variables set to zero before they are registered,
in order for the driver core to use them properly.
</p><p>
Then the dev variable is set to point to the
i2c_adapter's struct device variable; in this
case, the same structure, struct i2c_adapter,
contains both a struct device and a
struct class_device. The
class variable is set to the address of the
i2c_adapter_class variable, and then the
class_id variable is set to the same value as
the device's bus_id. Because the i2c_adapter
device's bus_id is unique, it also ensures
that the i2c_adapter class_device's class_id
is unique. Finally, the class device structure is registered with the kernel
driver core by a call to the
class_device_register function.
</p><p>
With the above code and two i2c adapters loaded on a test
machine, the /sys/class/i2c_adapter tree
might look like the following:



<pre     class="screen">

$ tree /sys/class/i2c-adapter/
/sys/class/i2c-adapter/
|-- i2c-0
|   |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0/00:07.3/i2c-0
|   `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/i2c/drivers/i2c_adapter
`-- i2c-2
    |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/legacy/i2c-2
    `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/i2c/drivers/i2c_adapter

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see by the above tree output, a
device and driver symbolic link are created automatically by the driver core to
point to the proper place within the sysfs tree that represents
those values. If the dev pointer was not set
to point to a struct device, those
symbolic links would not have been created. If you look in the
/sys/class/tty directory, the majority of
those class device entries do not have a corresponding
struct device, so those symbolic links are
not present.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2727000"></a>Class Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>
Class interfaces simply are a way for your code to be notified
whenever a struct class_device is
registered or unregistered from a specific class. A class
interface is defined with the struct class_interface structure. This
structure is simple and looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct class_interface {
    struct list_head  node;
    struct class      *class;
    int (*add)        (struct class_device *);
    void (*remove)    (struct class_device *);
};

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2727160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The class variable needs to be set to the
class about which we want to be notified. The
add and remove variables
should be set to a function that is called when any
devices are added or removed, respectively, from that class. It
is not necessary to set both the add and remove variables if you
do not want to be notified about one of those events.
</p><p>
To register a class interface with the kernel, the
class_interface_register function is
called. Likewise, to unregister a class interface, the
class_interface_unregister function is
called. An example of code that uses class interfaces is the CPU
frequency core; this code can be found at
kernel/cpufreq.c in the kernel source tree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x27272c0"></a>Creating Files</h2></div></div><p>
As described above, the i2c-adapter class is useful for easily
determining all of the different i2c adapters present
in the system and their specific location in the driver tree.
But i2c adapters are not directly addressable by a user. To
talk to an i2c adapter, an i2c chip driver needs to be loaded, or
the i2c-dev driver can be used. The
i2c-dev driver provides a character driver
interface to all i2c adapters present in the system.
Because it is useful to determine exactly which i2c-dev
devices are attached to which i2c adapters, a i2c-dev class was
created:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static struct class i2c_dev_class = {
    .name	= "i2c-dev"
};

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2727420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, when every i2c adapter is found by the
i2c-dev driver, a new i2c class device is
added to the driver core. This addition is done in the
i2c_add_class_device function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static void
i2c_add_class_device(char *name, int minor,
                     struct i2c_adapter *adap)
{
   struct i2c_dev *i2c_dev;
   int retval;

   i2c_dev = kmalloc(sizeof(*i2c_dev), GFP_KERNEL);
   if (!i2c_dev)
       return;
   memset(i2c_dev, 0x00, sizeof(*i2c_dev));

   if (adap-&gt;dev.parent == &amp;legacy_bus)
       i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev.dev = &amp;adap-&gt;dev;
   else
       i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev.dev = adap-&gt;dev.parent;
   i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev.class = &amp;i2c_dev_class;
   snprintf(i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev.class_id,
            BUS_ID_SIZE, "%s", name);
   retval =
       class_device_register(&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev);
   if (retval)
       goto error;
   class_device_create_file (&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev,
                             &amp;class_device_attr_dev);
   i2c_dev-&gt;minor = minor;
   spin_lock(&amp;i2c_dev_list_lock);
   list_add(&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;node, &amp;i2c_dev_list);
   spin_unlock(&amp;i2c_dev_list_lock);
   return;
error:
   kfree(i2c_dev);
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2727580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This function looks almost like the i2c_adapter class
registration code, with two exceptions. First, the
class_dev.dev field is set to be either the
adapter's parent device or the adapter's device. This is done
because some i2c adapters do not have a real parent in the
global kernel device tree, as they live on a bus that
has not been converted to the kernel driver model (like
ISA) or they do not really live on a bus at all (like some i2c
embedded controllers). When an i2c adapter does not have a
place in the kernel device tree, it is assigned to the legacy
bus. The legacy bus, located at /sys/devices/legacy, is used for these
kinds of devices.
</p><p>
The second thing that is different with this class device is
the line:

<pre     class="screen">

class_device_create_file (&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev, &amp;class_device_attr_dev);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x2727790"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The class_device_create_file function is
used to create a file in the class device's directory. The filename and attributes are defined with the
CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR macro as:



<pre     class="programlisting">

static ssize_t
show_dev(struct class_device *class_dev, char *buf)
{
   struct i2c_dev *i2c_dev = to_i2c_dev(class_dev);
   return sprintf(buf, "%04x\n",
                  MKDEV(I2C_MAJOR, i2c_dev-&gt;minor));
}
static
CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(dev, S_IRUGO, show_dev, NULL);

</pre>
</p><p>
The CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR macro is itself defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#define CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(_name,_mode,_show,_store) \
struct class_device_attribute                       \
class_device_attr_##_name = { 	                    \
    .attr  = {.name = __stringify(_name),           \
              .mode = _mode },                      \
    .show  = _show,                                 \
    .store = _store,                                \
};

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x27279f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The arguments within the CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR macro
are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
_name: both the name
of the file to be
created in sysfs and
part of the variable name
that describes this whole
attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
_mode: the file access mode with which the file is
created. Use the
standard access macros to specify the proper value.
</p></li><li><p>
_show: points to a function that
is called when the file
is read from. This function
must have the following return value and parameters. This variable does not
have
to be set if the file is
not to be read from.

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssize_t
show (struct class_device *class_dev, char *buf);
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
_store: points to a function that
is called when the file is written to. This
function must have the
following return value and
paramaters. This variable does not have
to be set if the file is
not to be written to.

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssize_t
store (struct device *dev, const char *buf,
       size_t count);
</pre>
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x271e758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Almost all driver model structures have an ATTR() macro that declares a file
within the sysfs tree.
</p><p>
In this example, a file named dev is
created when the class_device_create_file
function is called. This file is created to be
read-only by any user. If the file is read from, the
show_dev function is called by the
driver core. The show_dev function fills
in the buffer passed to it with the information it wants to
give the user. In this case, the major and minor number for
this specific device are passed to the user. All class devices
using a major and minor number should have a
dev file within their
sysfs class device directory.
</p><p>
The class_device_remove_file
function can be used to remove any files created by
the class_device_create_file function. But
it is not necessary to remove manually any file created if the
device is about to be removed. When devices are removed from
sysfs, all files created in their directories
are removed automatically by the sysfs core. So, when the
i2c-dev class device is removed from the system, all that is
needed is the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static void
i2c_remove_class_device(int minor)
{
    struct i2c_dev *i2c_dev = NULL;
    struct list_head *tmp;
    int found = 0;

    spin_lock(&amp;i2c_dev_list_lock);
    list_for_each (tmp, &amp;i2c_dev_list) {
        i2c_dev = list_entry(tmp, struct i2c_dev,
                             node);
        if (i2c_dev-&gt;minor == minor) {
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (found) {
        list_del(&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;node);
        spin_unlock(&amp;i2c_dev_list_lock);
        class_device_unregister(&amp;i2c_dev-&gt;class_dev);
        kfree(i2c_dev);
    } else {
    spin_unlock(&amp;i2c_dev_list_lock);
    }
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x271e968"></a>What It All Looks Like</h2></div></div><p>
With the i2c-dev driver and two i2c
adapter drivers (the i2c-piix4 and
i2c-isa drivers) loaded, the
/sys/class/i2c-dev directory might look
like the following:



<pre     class="screen">

$ tree /sys/class/i2c-dev/
/sys/class/i2c-dev/
|-- i2c-0
|   |-- dev

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x271eb20"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The dev file in the
/sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-2/ directory would
contain the following string:

<pre     class="screen">

$ cat /sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-2/dev

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262e580.0x271ec80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which corresponds to major number 86 and minor number 2, the
character major and minor numbers for this specific device.
</p><p>
Also, the /sys/bus/i2c/ directory with a
few i2c client drivers loaded looks like:



<pre     class="screen">

$ tree /sys/bus/i2c/
/sys/bus/i2c/
|-- devices

</p><p>
And, the actual /sys/devices/ directories
for the i2c adapters look like:

I think the best description of the kernel driver model's use of
interconnected structure pointers and representation to the user
was issued by Jonathan Corbet: &ldquo;web woven by a spider on
drugs&rdquo; (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/31185/" target="_self">lwn.net/Articles/31185/</a>).
Hopefully, these two articles have helped you unravel the
loony web, showing the true interconnectedness of all devices
within the kernel.

I would like to thank Pat Mochel for creating such a powerful
and complete framework in which all kernel drivers and devices
easily can be shown to the user. Also, a big thanks to all of
the kernel driver subsystem maintainers who have gladly
converted their subsystems over to this model; without their
help, the driver core code would have been little more than a
nice academic exercise.
