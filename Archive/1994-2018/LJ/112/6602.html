Eleven SSH Tricks</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Daniel R. Allen</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #112, August 2003</div></div><div><p>
Run remote GUI applications and tunnel any Net connection
securely using a free utility that's probably already installed on your
system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
SSH is the descendant of rsh and rlogin, which are
non-encrypted programs for remote shell logins. Rsh and rlogin, like
telnet, have a long lineage but now are outdated and insecure.
However, these programs evolved a surprising number of nifty features
over two decades of UNIX development, and the best of them made their
way into SSH. Following are the 11 tricks I have found useful
for squeezing the most power out of SSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901348"></a>
Installation and Versions</h2></div></div><p>
OpenSSH is the most common free version of SSH and is available for
virtually all UNIX-like operating systems. It is included by default with
Debian, SuSE, Red Hat, Mandrake, Slackware, Caldera and Gentoo Linux,
as well as OpenBSD, Cygwin for Windows and Mac OS X. This
article is based on OpenSSH, so if you are using some other
version, check your documentation before trying these tricks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901450"></a>
X11 Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
You can encrypt X sessions over SSH. Not only is the traffic encrypted,
but the DISPLAY environment variable on the remote system is set
properly. So, if you are running X on your local computer, your remote X
applications magically appear on your local screen.
</p><p>
Turn on X11 forwarding with <tt  >ssh -X host</tt>.
You should use X11 forwarding only for remote computers where
you trust the administrators. Otherwise, you open yourself up to
X11-based attacks.
</p><p>
A nifty trick using X11 forwarding displays images
within an xterm window. Run the web browser w3m with the in-line image
extension on the remote machine; see the Debian package w3m-img or
the RPM w3m-imgdisplay. It uses X11 forwarding to open a borderless
window on top of your xterm. If you read your e-mail remotely using SSH
and a text-based client, it then is possible to
bring up in-line images over the same xterm window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x19016b8"></a>
Config File</h2></div></div><p>
SSH looks for the user config file in ~/.ssh/config. A sample
might look like:
</p><pre     class="screen">
ForwardX11 yes
Protocol 2,1
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901818"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Using <tt  >ForwardX11 yes</tt> is the same as specifying
<tt  >-X</tt> on the command
line. The Protocol line tells SSH to try SSH2 first and then fall back to SSH1.
If you want to use only SSH2, delete the <tt  >,1</tt>.
</p><p>
The config file can include sections that take effect only for certain remote
hosts by using the Host option. Another useful config file
option is User, which specifies the remote user name. If you
often log in to a machine with <tt  >ssh -l remoteuser
remotehost</tt>
or <tt  >ssh remoteuser@remotehost</tt>, you can shorten this
by placing the
following lines in your config file:
</p><pre     class="screen">
Host remotehost
ForwardX11 yes
User remoteuser

Host *
ForwardX11 no
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901b88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now, you can type <tt  >ssh remotehost</tt> to log
on as user remoteuser with the ForwardX11 option
turned on. Otherwise, ForwardX11 is turned off,
as recommended above. The asterisk matches all hosts, including hosts already matched in a
Host section, but only the first matching option is used. Put specific
Host sections before generic sections in your config file.
</p><p>
A system-wide SSH config file, /etc/ssh/ssh_config, also is available.
SSH obtains configuration data in the following order: command-line
options, user's configuration file and system-wide configuration file.
All of the options can be explored by browsing man ssh_config.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901d40"></a>
Speeding Things Up: Compression and Ciphers</h2></div></div><p>
SSH can use gzip compression on any connection. The default compression
level is equivalent to approximately 4&times; compression for text. Compression
is a great idea if you are forwarding X sessions on a dial-up or slow
network. Turn on compression with <tt  >ssh -C</tt> or put
<tt  >Compression yes</tt> in your config file.
</p><p>
Another speed tweak involves changing your encryption cipher. The
default cipher on many older systems is triple DES (3DES), which is slower than
Blowfish and AES. New versions of OpenSSH default
to Blowfish. You can change the cipher to blowfish with <tt  >ssh -c
blowfish</tt>.
</p><p>
Cipher changes to your config file depend on whether you are connecting
with SSH1 or SSH2.
For SSH1, use <tt  >Cipher blowfish</tt>; for SSH2, use:


<pre     class="screen">
Ciphers blowfish-cbc,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,cast128-cbc,arcfour,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc
</pre>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902108"></a>
Port Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
Ports are the numbers representing different
services on a server; such as port 80 for HTTP and port 110 for POP3. You
can find the list of standard port numbers and their services in
/etc/services. SSH can translate transparently all traffic from an arbitrary port on
your computer to a remote server running SSH. The traffic then can be
forwarded by SSH to an arbitrary port on another server. Why would you
want to do this? Two reasons: encryption
and tunneled connections.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902210"></a>
Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Many applications use protocols where passwords and data are sent
as clear text. These protocols include POP3, IMAP, SMTP and NNTP.
SSH can encrypt these connections transparently.
Say your e-mail program normally connects to the POP3 port (110)
on mail.example.net. Also, say you can't SSH directly
to mail.example.net, but you have a shell login at
shell.example.net. You can instruct SSH to encrypt traffic from port 9110 (chosen
arbitrarily) on your local computer and send it to port 110 on
mail.example.net, using the SSH server at shell.example.net:
</p><pre     class="screen">
ssh -L 9110:mail.example.net:110 shell.example.net
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That is, send local port 9110 to mail.example.net port 110, over an SSH
connection to shell.example.net.
</p><p>
Then, simply tell your e-mail program to connect to port 9110 on
localhost. From there, data is encrypted, transmitted to
shell.example.net over the SSH port, then decrypted and passed to
mail.example.net over port 110.
As a neat side effect,
as far as the POP3 d&aelig;mon on mail.example.net knows, it is
accepting traffic from shell.example.net.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x19024d0"></a>
Tunneled Connections</h2></div></div><p>
SSH can act as a bridge through a firewall whether the firewall is
protecting your computer, a remote server or both. All you need is
an SSH server exposed to the other side of the firewall.
For example, many DSL and cable-modem companies forbid sending e-mail
from your own machine over port 25 (SMTP).
</p><p>
Our next example is sending
mail to your company's SMTP server through your cable-modem connection.
In this example, we use a shell account on the SMTP server, which is
named mail.example.net.
The SSH command is:
</p><pre     class="screen">
ssh -L 9025:mail.example.net:25 mail.example.net
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902688"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, tell your mail transport agent to connect to port 9025 on
localhost to send mail. This exercise should look quite similar
to the last example; we are tunneling from local port 9025 to
mail.example.net port 25 over mail.example.net.
As far as the firewall sees, it is passing normal SSH data on the normal
SSH port, 22, between you and mail.example.net.
</p><p>
A final example is connecting through an ISP firewall to a mail
or news server inside a restricted network. What would this look like?
In fact, it would be the same as the first example; mail.example.net
can be walled away inside the network, inaccessible to the outside
world. All you need is an SSH connection to a server that can see it,
such as shell.example.net. Is that neat or what?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x19027e8"></a>
Limitations/Refinements to Port Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
If a port is reassigned on a computer (the local port in the examples
above), every user of that computer sees the reassigned port.
If the local system has multiple users, tunnel only from unused,
high-numbered ports to avoid confusion. If you want to forward a
privileged local port (lower than 1024), you need to do so as root.
Forwarding a lower-numbered port might be useful if a program won't let you
change its port, such as standard BSD FTP.
</p><p>
By default, a tunneled local port is accessible only to local users and
not by remote connection. However, any user can make the tunneled
port available remotely by using the -g option. Again, you can
do this to privileged ports only if you are root.
</p><p>
Any user who can log in with SSH can expose any
port inside a private network to the outside world
using port forwarding.
As an administrator, if you allow incoming SSH
connections, you're really allowing incoming
connections of any kind. You can configure the
OpenSSH d&aelig;mon to refuse port forwarding with
<tt  >AllowTcpForwarding no</tt>, but a determined user can forward anyway.
</p><p>
A config file option is available to forward ports; it is called
LocalForward. The first port-forwarding example given above could
be written as:
</p><pre     class="screen">
Host forwardpop
Hostname shell.example.com
LocalForward 9110 mail.example.com:110
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902b00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This way, if you type <tt  >ssh forwardpop</tt> you receive the same
result as in the first example. This example uses the Host
command described above and the HostName command, which
specifies a real hostname with which to connect.
</p><p>
Finally, a command similar to LocalForward, called
RemoteForward, forwards a port from the computer to which you are
connected, to your computer. Please read the ssh_config man pages to
find out how.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902cb8"></a>
Piping Binary Data to a Remote Shell</h2></div></div><p>
Piping works transparently through SSH to remote shells. Consider:
</p><pre     class="screen">

cat myfile | ssh user@desktop lpr

tar -cf - source_dir | \
ssh user@desktop 'cat &gt; dest.tar'

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfb068"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first example pipes myfile to lpr running on the machine named
desktop. The second example creates a tar file and writes it to the
terminal (because the tar file name is specified as dash), which is then piped
to the machine named desktop and redirected to a file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfb170"></a>
Running Remote Shell Commands</h2></div></div><p>
With SSH, you don't need to open an interactive shell if you simply want
some output from a remote command, such as:
</p><pre     class="screen">
ssh user@host w
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfb2d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This command runs the command <b  >w</b> on host as user and
displays the result. It can be used to automate commands, such as:
</p><pre     class="screen">

perl -e 'foreach $i (1 .. 12) \
{print `ssh server$i "w"`}'

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfb488"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Notice the back-ticks around the SSH command. This uses Perl to call SSH
12 times, each time running the command <b  >w</b> on a
different remote host, server1 through server12.
In addition, you need to enter your password each time SSH
makes a connection. However, read on for a way to eliminate the password
requirement without sacrificing security.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfb5e8"></a>
Authentication</h2></div></div><p>
How does SSH authenticate that you should be allowed to connect?
Here are some options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
By hostnames only: uses .rhosts file; insecure; disabled by default.
</p></li><li><p>
By hostnames and host-key checking.
</p></li><li><p>
The S/Key one-time password system.
</p></li><li><p>
Kerberos: private-key encryption with time-expired
&ldquo;tickets&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Smart card.
</p></li><li><p>
Password prompt.
</p></li><li><p>
Public key.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfbc70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The most common authentication method is by password prompt, which is
how most SSH installations are run out of the box.
</p><p>
However, public key encryption is worth investigating; it is considerably
more secure than passwords, and by using it you can do away with all
or most of your password typing.
</p><p>
Briefly, public key encryption relies on two keys: a public key
to encrypt, which you don't keep secret, and a private key to
decrypt, which is kept private on your local computer.
The general idea is to run <tt  >ssh-keygen</tt> to generate your keys.
Press Return when it asks you for a passphrase. Then copy your public
key to the remote computer's authorized_keys file.
</p><p>
The details depend on whether the computer to which you are connecting uses
SSH1 or SSH2. For SSH1 type <tt  >ssh-keygen -t rsa1</tt>,
and copy ~/.ssh/identity.pub to the end of the file
~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote computer. For SSH2, type
<tt  >ssh-keygen -t rsa</tt>,
and copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the end of the file
~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote computer. This file
might be called ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2, depending on your
OpenSSH version. If the first one doesn't work, try the second.
The payoff is you can log in without typing a password.
</p><p>
You can use a passphrase that keeps
the private key secret on your local computer. The passphrase encrypts
the private key using 3DES. At no time is your passphrase or any secret
information sent over the network. You still have to enter the passphrase
when connecting to a remote computer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfbfe0"></a>
Authentication Agent</h2></div></div><p>
You might wonder: if we want to use a passphrase, are we stuck back
where we started, typing in a passphrase every time we log in? No.
Instead, you can use a passphrase, but type it only once instead of every time
you use the private key. To set up this passphrase, execute
<tt  >ssh-agent</tt> when you first start
your session. Then execute <tt  >ssh-add</tt>, which prompts
for your passphrase and stores it in memory, not on disk. From then on,
all connections authenticating with your private key use the version
in memory, and you won't be asked for a password.
</p><p>
Your distribution may be set up to start ssh-agent
when you start X. To see if it's already running, enter
<tt  >ssh-add -L</tt>.
If the agent is not running already, you need to
start it, which you can do by adding it to your
.bash_login, logging out and logging back in again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc248"></a>
Authentication Agent Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
If you connect from one server to another using public key authentication,
you don't need to run an authentication agent on both. SSH automatically can
pass any authentication requests coming from other servers,
back to the agent running on your own computer. This way, it never passes your
secret key to the remote computer; rather, it performs authentication on
your computer and sends the results back to the remote computer.
</p><p>
To set up authentication agent forwarding, simply run <tt  >ssh -A</tt> or add the following line to your config file:
</p><pre     class="screen">
ForwardAgent yes
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc4b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You should use authentication agent forwarding only if you trust the
administrators of the remote computer; you risk them using
your keys as if they were you. Otherwise, it is quite secure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc5b8"></a>
Traveling with SSH Java Applet</h2></div></div><p>
Many people carry a floppy with PuTTY or
another Windows SSH program, in case they need to
use an unsecured computer while traveling. This
method works if you have the ability to run
programs from the floppy drive. You also can
download PuTTY from the web site and run it.
</p><p>
Another alternative is putting an SSH Java applet on a web page
that you can use from a browser.
An excellent Java SSH client is Mindterm, which is free for noncommercial
use. You can find it at <a href="http://www.appgate.com/mindterm" target="_self">www.appgate.com/mindterm</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc770"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
An SSH configuration can go wrong in a few places if you
are using these various tricks. You can catch many problems by using
<tt  >ssh -v</tt> and watching the output.
Of course, none of these tricks is essential to using SSH.
Eventually, though, you may encounter situations where you're glad you know them.
So give a few of them a try.
