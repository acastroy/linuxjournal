No, Fran&ccedil;ois. This kind of sniffer has nothing to do with wine.
Wine is one area when the human nose performs far better than any
software, no matter how clever the programmer. Honestly,
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mon ami</i></span>,
sampling the wine, for quality control reasons of course, is not a task
I wish to automate. Other uses exist for the kinds of sniffers
we are likely to encounter when cooking with Linux.
</p><p>
Look here, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mon ami</i></span>. Notice how much of our bandwidth is being used here
and here. Are you curious as to what those connections really represent?
Fran&ccedil;ois, why are you looking away? Ah, our guests are here. Why did
you not say something?
</p><p>
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Bonsoir, mes amis</i></span>! Welcome once again to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of
tantalizing Linux fare, great wines from the world over and a general
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>penchant</i></span> for all things open source. Please sit and make yourselves
comfortable. Before you walked in, I was telling Fran&ccedil;ois about the
many hidden bits of information flying across the average network.
Speaking of hidden delights, Fran&ccedil;ois, please hurry to the wine cellar.
Head to the west wing and bring back the 1995 Rioja Imperial Gran Reserva.
This Spanish red is the perfect networking wine,
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>non</i></span>?
</p><p>
As I was telling my faithful waiter, a great deal is happening on
the average network, and many people are completely oblivious to all but
those connections they themselves have initiated. The simplest tool for checking out active network connections is included
in every Linux distribution, <b  >netstat</b>. By using the
-a and -p options, you can find out about almost
every open connection (or port) on your system and what programs are
using them.
</p><p>
Notice what happens when I run the program. I'm going to use the
-n option as well, which tells netstat not to worry
about resolving IP addresses into symbolic addresses. This makes the
program run a bit faster because no name resolution is performed. The
result
can be quite a long listing, so I pipe the output to
<b  >more</b>:

</p><p>
Ah Fran&ccedil;ois, you are back with the wine. Excellent. Please pour for
our guests.
</p><p>
The listing I've shown you is only a partial listing, but the entire
listing is
incomplete itself. The reason for this is iptables masqueraded connections
are not visible to netstat; that information is in another
location, specifically /proc/net/ip_conntrack. The PID is the
process ID of the running program using the connection. Now,
we could do a <tt  >cat</tt> on /proc/net/ip_conntrack, but
the output doesn't make for eye-friendly reading. Look at the following
sample (the output is a single, wrapped line):
</p><pre     class="screen">
tcp      6 431253 ESTABLISHED src=192.168.22.5
&#8618;dst=192.168.22.10 sport=34212 dport=22
&#8618;src=192.168.22.10 dst=192.168.22.5 sport=22
&#8618;dport=34212 [ASSURED] use=1
</pre><p>
Patrick Lagac&eacute; obviously found this unpleasant to read
as well. His conntrack viewer script is available at
<a href="http://cv.intellos.net" target="_self">cv.intellos.net</a>. Because it is a Perl script, simply
change the permissions to make the script executable after you have
downloaded it, then run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x conntrack-viewer.pl
./contrack-viewer.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, the output shows all connections, including the masqueraded
ones. To limit the output to masqueraded connections only, use the
-m option. The reverse effect (no masqueraded connections)
can be achieved with the -d option. Have a look at Figure 1
for a sample of the output.

Figure 1. conntrack Viewer Displays Masqueraded Connections
</p></div></div><p>
Alexander Neptun's <b  >Nnetstat</b> is a nice graphical tool for
displaying active connections, routing tables and so on. To get your
copy, visit <a href="http://www.aneptun.de/linux/Nnetstat" target="_self">www.aneptun.de/linux/Nnetstat</a> and download
the latest version. This is basically a Perl script, so no real installation has to
be done other than making sure Nnetstat.pl is executable.
As it turns out, Nnetstat also requires the Gtk.pm
modules libraries, and while Perl should be on your system, this
module likely is not. The easiest way to get it is from the Perl CPAN
repository, and the command line still is your friend here:

<pre     class="programlisting">

perl -MCPAN -e "install Gtk"

</pre>
</p><p>
If this is the first time you install Perl modules in this manner, you'll
go through a little question-and-answer session. Follow through, accept
the defaults and trust the system. What you need to decide is the
location of the closest CPAN mirrors. Select your continent and country
when asked, then select the available local mirrors. Once this is done,
the Gtk installation continues on its own.
</p><p>
Installing the Gtk Perl modules does take some time. I probably should
warn you that at some point near the end of the installation, a set
of tests is performed. Don't be surprised when a graphical box pops
up asking you to click Run to test all sorts of graphical magic
associated with the package. When you are happy with the result, click
Close to terminate the tests and complete the installation.

Figure 2. Nnetstat is a nice, graphical netstat.
</p></div></div><p>
For a truly terrifying (or amusing, depending on your perspective)
view of exactly what is flying across your system, run
<b  >Driftnet</b>. The name itself should be enough to send shivers up
your spine. Simply put, Driftnet listens on a selected interface for
image or video traffic (MPEG only), then displays the images it finds.
Whether this display is more frightening to the system administrator who finds out
what users are watching or to the users themselves, depends
on more factors than we adequately can cover here. That said, this
collection of images is completely indiscriminate and doesn't in any way
point to a specific user.
</p><p>
To get your copy of Driftnet, head on over to Chris Lightfoot's web site at
<a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/~chris/driftnet" target="_self">www.ex-parrot.com/~chris/driftnet</a> and pick up the source.
Before the Pythonists among you ask, last time I checked, his web site
had not yet ceased to be nor was it pining for the Fjords.
</p><p>
Some prerequisite libraries are required to build Driftnet,
most notably libungif, libjpeg and
libpcap. If you don't have them installed already, the
links are in the Resources section of this article, but check your distribution CDs first.
Building the package is then a simple matter of extracting the tarball and
running a <tt  >make</tt> in the source directory. You then can run the resulting
program from the directory itself or copy it to a more useful location:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./driftnet -i eth0
</pre>
</p><p>
Because Driftnet needs to set the interface to promiscuous
mode, you need to run it as root. Look at Figure 3 for a sample of
Driftnet in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6882f3.large.jpg"><img src="6882f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Driftnet in action: all your images belong to us.
</p></div></div><p>
Sure, looking at pretty pictures flying across your network is fun if you
don't consider the bandwidth costs, but what other interesting things are
moving across those wires? There are Web requests, file downloads, e-mail
messages, instant messaging sessions and more. Most network monitors,
netstat included, show you active connections, but what precisely
do those connections represent?
</p><p>
David Leonard has created an ncurses-based program called
<b  >pktstat</b> (<a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/personal/software/#pktstat" target="_self">www.itee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/personal/software/#pktstat</a>)
that does a nice job of showing you what percentage of bandwidth each
connection uses. It also keeps a running load average in the style of
uptime but tracks network transfer rates rather than processes
in a run queue. What sets the program apart is its ability to display
filenames associated with the packets sailing across your Web server or
files being downloaded from client PCs on your network.
Building pktstat is a matter of extracting the source,
switching to the directory and typing <tt  >make</tt>:


<pre     class="programlisting">

tar -xzvf pktstat-1.7.2q.tar.gz
cd pktstat-1.7.2q
make
su -c "make install"

</pre>
</p><p>
To run the program, use the -i parameter to specify the
interface on which you wish to listen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pktstat -i eth1
</pre>
</p><p>
A window appears, similar to the one in Figure 4. As you can
see, I've started a download of the latest OpenOffice.org software.
The actual filename is displayed below the connection information; the same is true with HTTP Web requests. You can see not only the
address of the file being downloaded but the filename too, whether it
be an HTML page or an image.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6882f4.large.jpg"><img src="6882f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Filenames are resolved in pktstat's display.
</p></div></div><p>
Speaking of traffic, if you are looking to concentrate your
efforts simply on what and where your network is being used,
the final item on tonight's menu may be more appropriate.
<b  >IPTraf</b> is one
of your humble chef's favorite IP-traffic monitoring tools, one that
I go back to time and again. This is a ncurses-based application that
displays IP traffic, byte and packet counts (including non-IP packets),
UDP traffic, incoming vs. outgoing traffic and more. IPTraf is a package
every person in charge of a network should have handy.
</p><p>
Visit Gerard Paul Java's web site at <a href="http://iptraf.seul.org" target="_self">iptraf.seul.org</a>
to pick up your copy of IPTraf. Extract the tarred and gzipped source,
then <tt  >cd</tt> to that directory and run the
<b  >Setup</b> to build
the package. The installation process finishes by copying the binary
to /usr/local/bin. To run IPTraf, type <tt  >iptraf</tt>, press
Enter and you are on your way (Figure 5 shows an active IPTraf session).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6882f5.large.jpg"><img src="6882f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. IPTraf's Default Monitoring Window
</p></div></div><p>
As IPTraf gathers and displays information, the screen
may get very busy, very quickly. What I like to do is run the program in a
larger X terminal, say 80 &times; 40. Pressing the Esc key lets you back out
of the current function or view. From there, you can change settings,
add or remove filters and continue with your data gathering. IPTraf also
provides different views, from the default station-to-station traffic,
basic and detailed interface traffic stats and physical stats to
packet size breakdowns. Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity
of this package. IPTraf is flexible enough to satisfy a great many IP
monitoring needs.

Well, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>, closing time is rapidly approaching. As Fran&ccedil;ois
refills your glasses, I hope you will walk away with an appreciation
of exactly how much is happening on your network. Keep in mind,
however, that along with the richness of information these tools can
deliver, moral and social implications are attached. Good
system administrators know what is happening on their networks.
They also know when to look the other way.
On that note, I raise my glass to you, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes
amis</i></span>.
