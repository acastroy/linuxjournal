Red Hat 9, code-named Shrike, was released on April 7, 2003. It
took everyone by surprise, including this
reviewer, who was expecting an 8.1 release. As a matter of fact,
starting with this release, the offering from Red Hat has
changed, clearly splitting into two lines with different
purposes and targets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x169f058"></a>
Product Lines</h2></div></div><p>
The Enterprise line is designed for professional use on
mission-critical servers or corporate workstations with
powerful hardware and the need for the highest possible
stability. This product
line will have release cycles of 12&ndash;18 months and five years
of support for every version, which is great for all those
companies that have to develop and maintain products for
several years. The top product is the Advanced Server for up to
eight CPUs and 16GB of main memory. The ES server is
basically the same thing but optimized and scaled down for
systems with no more than two CPUs and 4GB of RAM. The
Enterprise Workstation is the version for the corporate
desktop. The first and last products also are available for the
Itanium 2 processor.
</p><p>
Standard Red Hat Linux is defined by Red Hat
itself as a &ldquo;community product for SOHO users, independent
professionals, students and hobbyists with minimal support
needs&rdquo;. It also has a professional edition ($149.95 US), with
an extra multimedia CD, manuals and phone support for 60
days. This line marks the beginning of a different numbering scheme.
Patches and updates will be released, of course, but for
periods shorter than the Enterprise Line (Red Hat says &ldquo;at
least until April 30, 2004&rdquo;), and the next version will be 10,
not 9.1. This review covers Red Hat Linux 9.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x169f268"></a>
Base System</h2></div></div><p>
The kernel shipped with the CDs is 2.4.20. Everything has been
compiled with GCC 3.2.1 and with GNU libc 2.3.2.
Both the kernel and the libraries already have
been updated on Red Hat's web site, so be sure to grab the latest versions
from <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh9-errata.html" target="_self">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh9-errata.html</a> after you
install. The Web
server installed is Apache httpd 2.0.
</p><p>
Installation didn't really differ from previous releases, except for
more refined Red Hat commercials, but produced
better end results. This is the first Red Hat on my computer
that allowed me to use my UMAX Astra 610S scanner without
manual tweaking.
</p><p>
In user space, all the most popular applications are
provided. The shipped versions often are a bit behind those
provided, for example, by Mandrake 9.1, but unless one really
wants the bleeding edge,
this is not a big deal. The versions
of some of the most popular programs are reported in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x169f4d0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Popular Programs Included in Red Hat 9
</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Popular Programs Included in Red Hat 9&#10;6870t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Emacs</td><td>21.2</td></tr><tr><td>Evolution</td><td>1.2.2</td></tr><tr><td>Gaim</td><td>0.59.8</td></tr><tr><td>Galeon</td><td>1.2.7</td></tr><tr><td>GIMP</td><td>1.2.3</td></tr><tr><td>GnuPG</td><td>1.2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Kdebase</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>KOffice</td><td>1.2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Mozilla</td><td>1.2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Mutt</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>OpenOffice.org</td><td>1.0.2</td></tr><tr><td>OpenSSH</td><td>3.5p1</td></tr><tr><td>Perl</td><td>5.8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Quanta</td><td>3.1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Some applications may have benefited from a more modular
packaging. OpenOffice.org, for example, requires two extra
RPMs, openoffice-libs and openoffice-i18n. The files to
manage all conceivable languages are placed on disk, no matter
what you choose at install time. The end result is that on
Shrike, OpenOffice takes almost 200MB of space.
</p><p>
System-wide support for UTF-8 is great, in spite of one
issue, which doesn't depend on Red Hat. There
is no clean, unique solution to guarantee that all, possibly
old, Perl scripts will continue to process all, possibly old,
text files as expected. As serious as it is, this problem
comes from the simple fact that text files are plain and cannot specify how their content is
encoded, unlike e-mail messages and XML documents. The script must then be
helped from the outside by setting environment
variables to work properly.
</p><p>
This release is the first Red Hat to support the
 Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL). This
should increase performance if an application has been
coded or modified to use it. On the other hand, it
may interfere with some old applications or with ones
operating at a very low level, such as WINE. If this is the case on
your system, NPTL can be turned off at the user level by
adding the following to the cshrc or bashrc files, where kernel-version is 2.4.1 or 2.2.5:
</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=<i>kernel-version</i>
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x1697048"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or system-wide by adding
<tt  >nosysinfo</tt> at the end of the kernel load line
in your bootloader configuration. The release notes also warn that
&ldquo;kernel support for the new NPTL feature changes several internal kernel
programming interfaces significantly. As a result, several external
kernel modules may not compile without modifications.. Examples currently
include the NVIDIA and ATI 3-D modules.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x1697200"></a>
User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Fonts are anti-alised and are beautiful. The integration with
the xft2/fontconfig system has matured from Red Hat 8. The
most common problem annoying early users, the fact that
the dash and other characters in man pages were not
displayed properly under an UTF-8 locale, now is gone.
Some applications still work outside the system, however. OpenOffice.org is the
main case, but being a cross-platform application it will
move to fontconfig later, and Red Hat configured OpenOffice.org fonts
properly anyway.
</p><p>
The process started with Red Hat 8&mdash;customizing
GNOME and KDE to offer a consistent look called
Bluecurve and the same default choice for the most common
tasks such as Web browsing and e-mail&mdash;continues. I deliberately
chose to review the KDE desktop partly because it is not Red
Hat's first choice, and partly because
the difference is smaller in Red Hat. Figure 1 shows an almost
vanilla Bluecurve/KDE screenshot. My only changes were placing
the panel vertically, not installing Evolution and choosing different
colors for the main panel icons. The icons for the text files
include the beginning of the text of the file.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6870f1.large.jpg"><img src="6870f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KDE in Red Hat 9
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 also shows a change from Red Hat 8 that came
from popular demand&mdash;a different menu organization. Each
submenu lists only five to ten applications and has a &ldquo;More
programs of this type&rdquo; submenu. This definitely makes
searching for programs easier. The first five entries of the
main menu are filled dynamically with the five most used or
most recently used programs. For some reason, not all the menu
entries are considered when doing this. I added Mutt, opened
it continuously, and it never showed up at the top.
</p><p>
Another minor annoyance with the desktop is the fact that, although
automount works nicely and opens a file manager window as soon
as you insert a CD-ROM, it works too much in at least one case.
When I inserted the first Red Hat 9 CD, simply to read the
release notes, the system said that to run the
rh-install-helper, I had (rightly) to type the root password.
When I clicked cancel, it exited with &ldquo;unknown exit code&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x1697678"></a>
Multimedia</h2></div></div><p>
The short story is that Red Hat 9 can play music and movies
fine, it simply doesn't want to by default. The
distribution does not include MP3 players, deCSS or anything
else, including the fortune program, that cannot be certified
as freely redistributable with respect to current law.
Please don't whine about this, as it does the
right thing, which is to force the end user to choose
between asking her government representative if certain laws, such as
the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) can
be reformed, or deliberately installing the missing packages herself,
which is really easy anyway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x1697780"></a>
System Management</h2></div></div><p>
Under both GNOME and KDE,
normal users can do
everything they typically are allowed to do without
problems. The only misconfiguration I found is shown in
Figure 2. LPD is declared as the currently used printing
system, although CUPS had been chosen. Everything printed fine, but the text is misleading.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6870f2.large.jpg"><img src="6870f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Shrike/KDE Control Center
</p></div></div><p>
Red Hat provides its
own set of system administration tools, most of them named
redhat-config-* (simply type <tt  >redhat-</tt>, then press Tab while logged
in as root to see them all). All are documented in the
downloadable or printed Red Hat manuals and are adequate for
beginning and intermediate system administrators.
Figure 3 shows the security/firewall tool, which is limited but sufficient
for home users. The only problem found with other services is
that the redhat-switch-mail tool would not work in the text
version.

Miscellanea</h2></div></div><p>
The CD-ROM includes the KDE-EDU package, a nice collection of
educational and recreational programs. This household's
favorite is KStars, shown in Figure 4.

Scanning and OCR</h2></div></div><p>
As already mentioned, Shrike was the first Red Hat version to
let me use my scanner without changing any settings.
I was able to scan without a glitch, so when I saw the
OCR button I immediately pressed it (I consider this the
number one application area still sorely missing good software
for Linux, be it free or proprietary). The system answered
with &ldquo;gocr: command not found&rdquo;. I didn't find this program on
the CD-ROMs, so it does seem to have escaped the dependency
checks. I found the gocr RPM on-line and am still testing it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x16980c8"></a>
CD Burning</h2></div></div><p>
During the first weeks of life of the Shrike users list, a
noticeable amount of traffic was devoted to CD burning
problems. On the test system used for this review, using
Xcdroast on a Philips CDRW1600 device, no problems were
observed. Everything was recognized without manual
intervention, and no disks were wasted. Several users reported
that problems disappeared by removing the magicdev package. This
tool is supposed to perform several user-friendly actions when
removable media are inserted&mdash;playing audio CDs, opening a
burn window in Nautilus and so on. The fact that Nautilus
(and its dependencies, like magicdev) were not installed on
the test system seems to confirm the hypothesis that magicdev,
at least as packaged in Red Hat 9 version 1.1.4, is not ready
for prime time, at least not for all systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a6580.0x16981d0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat 9 is indeed a nice desktop. Overall performance, even
on a relatively limited system, is not slower than with the
previous release. The convergence imposed on KDE and GNOME is
much less dramatic than it may seem and hopefully will lead
to less work to maintain future versions and fix the
quirks reported here.
