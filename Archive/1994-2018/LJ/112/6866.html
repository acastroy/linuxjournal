<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #112, August 2003</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Interrupt request handlers</b></span> have changed
their return values in the 2.5 tree to
handle certain error conditions involving
peripheral devices better. One result of this is that
many, many drivers were broken at the source level
and had to be fixed. For drivers included in the
official kernel source, this was a repetitive,
undesirable chore, but still feasible. Countless
external drivers, however, can be fixed only when
someone notices they no longer work; although
proprietary drivers may take much longer than
that. This is par for the course of the kernel
development cycle, though such a large change is
never undertaken lightly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz</b></span> is officially at
the top of <span   class="bold"><b>IDE</b></span> maintainership. <span   class="bold"><b>Andre
Hedrick</b></span> has (for the moment at least) stepped
aside to focus on <span   class="bold"><b>Serial ATA (SATA)</b></span> and vendor
chipset issues. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> remains the official
liaison to <span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span> for all IDE patches.
Andre also has
decided to release all his
kernel contributions retroactively under a dual license, instead
of under only the <span   class="bold"><b>GNU General Public
License</b></span>. The
second license is now <span   class="bold"><b>Lawrence E. Rosen's Open
Software License</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Benjamin Herrenschmidt </b></span>forked the
<span   class="bold"><b>RADEON</b></span>
Framebuffer code, when <span   class="bold"><b>Ani Joshi</b></span>, the official
maintainer, failed to apply patches or respond
to e-mails. With Ani's disappearance, Benjamin
collected a variety of patches that had
been floating around and released a new RadeonFB
update. As of early May 2003, this driver still needs
a lot of work; Benjamin's plan is to continue
working with the current code base for 2.4 and
try to get a complete rewrite into the 2.5 tree
in spite of the feature-freeze. Some developers,
like Alan Cox, have said the feature-freeze is
not really in effect anymore. If so, the first
attempt to stabilize 2.5 in preparation for 2.6
(or 3.0) has been a failure.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>I/O Controls</b></span> (ioctls) have been on the way
out ever since <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span>
emerged out of the 2.5 planning discussions. In the old days,
folks used to rail against ioctl functions in kernel drivers. Not only were
there hordes and hordes of them, but it was impossible to know exactly how
many there were, and it was therefore impossible to document all of them
properly.
Although there are still plenty to get rid of, more and more are
migrating to the saner SysFS interface. And, some that have never been used
at all, like SCSI_IOCTL_BENCHMARK_COMMAND and SCSI_IOCTL_SYNC, are being
removed as part of that general cleanup. It looks as though SysFS soon
will become the primary interface between userland and the kernel, replacing
ioctls and the unruly <span   class="bold"><b>ProcFS</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has been working on a
replacement for <span   class="bold"><b>devfs</b></span> (and /dev) since
early 2003 and finally released an initial
version of <span   class="bold"><b>udev</b></span> in mid-April, based on
designs and ideas by <span   class="bold"><b>Dan Stekloff</b></span>. The
/dev directory always has been a mess, typically
including hundreds and hundreds of unnecessary
files. Although udev is only one among a crowd of
possible replacements, including devfs itself,
it seems clear that this area of the kernel will
be undergoing extensive modifications in the 2.5
time frame and the next unstable series.

Three years ago I reviewed several good programs I still use today,
such as arping, SendEmail, SICKnotes and CIDR. But the most uniquely
useful one is Bartleby. What I like best about Bartleby is
its flexibility and usefulness for all kinds of things not foreseen by
the author. As I get older, my mind doesn't remember like it used to.
But I can remember to send off a quick note, check it later and act
on it. It's as simple as <tt  >bartleby "start writing linux web
book"</tt>. Yes, the script bartleby is mine and saves me writing
<tt  >echo "message" | syslog@localhost</tt>, but that's
small peanuts. If you try this and get in the habit of using it,
you'll see how valuable it is. Requires: Perl, Perl modules DBI,
CGI, DBD::Mysql or DBD::Pg, MySQL or Postgres database, MTA, Web server,
Web browser.

Got X? No? But there's too much to remember to burn a CD on that
VT-only server with the brand new high-performance CD burner?
Miss your xcdroast, gcombust, k3b, whatever? Try cdwrite. It
takes the pain out of creating a data image and writing it or reading
and writing audio tracks. If you have the tools installed, you don't
have to keep re-reading the man pages simply to burn an image.
Requires: bash, cdparanoia, cdrdao, mkisofs, cdrecord.

This particular backup utility isn't meant to back up your system,
rather it backs up configuration files. It creates an HTML file with
all the data in it, tars it up and compresses it if requested.
iBackup also can upload this file to another system for safekeeping.
This makes saving and restoring critical data (like your password,
group and shadow files, BIND files, etc.) quick and easy. Requires:
BASH, tar, gzip, ifconfig, netstat, standard UNIX tools.

It slices. It dices. You can sort it, search it, export it or import it.
You create the categories and subcategories, then create the
columns as any of Boolean, Integer or String. In fact, this looks like
a nice utility to use for any number of applications, not only for
inventory, but how you abuse it is strictly up to you. I doubt anyone will
say anything if you used it as a to-do list or address book. Few things
beyond pencil and paper are this flexible, and almost none are as powerful.

This Perl script is simply too easy. You create a directory, copy
all the files you want to show on a web page into it, then run
<tt  >jigl.pl</tt> from inside that directory. This gives you
instant thumbnails, web pages for each thumbnail, and you can look
through the slides one by one. You can customize using
various templates that aren't difficult to manage.

You've got an enterprise. Your enterprise has a network. You want to go
wireless, but you want to manage the unwired parts of your network as
well as you manage the wired parts&mdash;maybe even better.
An inexpensive answer comes in the form of Sputnik's new AP 120, an
intelligent wireless access point (WAP) that lets you know who is on
your wireless network and how much they're using it, through Sputnik
Central Control software.

Sputnik, by the way, is the company started last year by David LaDuke,
David Sifry and Arthur Tyde&mdash;the same guys who founded Linuxcare.
Both the AP 120 and Sputnik Central Control software run on Linux and
are available through the Sputnik site and OEM channels.

not in Open Source, it's in proprietary&mdash;it's rather transparent as to
