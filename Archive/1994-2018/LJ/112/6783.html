The Power of the Incredible Hulk&mdash;the ILM Linux Death Star</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Robin Rowe</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #112, August 2003</div></div><div><p>The story in the July 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> about the Linux desktop and renderfarm conversion
at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) drew record interest from
readers. Linux has advanced at ILM in the past year, meeting the special
challenges ILM faced in creating the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hulk</em></span>
(release June 2003).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe81298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> Death Star exists! But, not as a
menacing planet-killing weapon. ILM's Death Star
renderfarm is the computing power behind the many
motion pictures produced at Industrial Light &amp;
Magic. &ldquo;Linux will just continue to grow&rdquo;, says
ILM CTO Cliff Plumer. &ldquo;Our renderfarm has over
1,500 processors currently, and almost 1,000
more are added every evening with desktops.&rdquo; The
renderfarm utilizes both dedicated CPUs and the
computing power of idle desktops.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe81500"></a>
The Death Star Renderfarm</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Our core renderfarm is comprised almost
entirely of Linux boxes since we switched over
from SGI machines&rdquo;, says ILM Systems Developer
Mike Thompson. &ldquo;We have about 750 nodes&mdash;1,500 CPUs.&rdquo; The renderfarm exists as a row of
computing towers made up of 1U rackmount dual-processor
PCs. However, this isn't a supercomputer in the
classic sense. Each machine operates
semi-independently in a grid configuration,
not bound together as a supercomputer running a
single job. At ILM, a proprietary batch-scheduling
program called ObaQ manages the workload across
machines.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6783f2.large.jpg"><img src="6783f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. ILM RackSaver Linux renderfarm has 1,500
processors now, which will double for <span  class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars
Episode III</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
As the raw horsepower of systems increased, so
did the demand for electricity and cooling in ILM's
machine room. &ldquo;It's important to reduce
power and heat&rdquo;, says Thompson. &ldquo;We went with AMD
Athlon 1600 CPUs, a low-power variant that can be
a little difficult to find.&rdquo; Each node has 2GB of
memory, expandable to 4GB, and each node usually runs
two jobs at once to utilize the dual processors,
but sometimes this is reduced to a single job for
full use of memory.
</p><p>
The AMD-powered nodes are RS-1100 units produced
by RackSaver. RackSaver caught ILM's attention
at a National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)
convention and was given the opportunity to bid on
building the renderfarm. RackSaver competes mostly
with heavyweights IBM and Dell. RackSaver CEO David
Diggers says RackSaver's advantage is servers
with double the density of competitors. &ldquo;We're
very strong in this vertical market with sales to ILM,
Pixar and Warner Brothers&rdquo;, he said.
</p><p>
The RackSaver renderfarm servers are connected via 100BASE-TX into a
Foundry 8000 switch that aggregates network traffic into a gigabit link
into the network core. &ldquo;Just recently we added a 10-gigabit link into our
core which helped a lot&rdquo;, says Thompson. &ldquo;We have a file server core and
2,500 rendering cores with total aggregate traffic of about 70TB
a day.&rdquo;

Why Green Is Scary</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hulk</em></span> is not a typical comic book movie&rdquo;, says
Technical Director Doug Sutton. &ldquo;It is some of the
most challenging work we've done in years. Making
a 15-foot-tall green guy look real is an incredible
challenge!&rdquo; The Hulk is a computer-generated (CG)
digital actor with emotions and complex green skin.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Film is designed to make people not look green, to push green
away&rdquo;,
says Principal Software Engineer Rod Bogart. &ldquo;We're using Kodak Premiere
print stock that has deeper color than Kodak Vision. If the character is
green, as with Hulk, it's hard to make it look like green skin. The green
dinosaurs of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jurassic Park</em></span> are not as hard. Dinosaurs don't have the same
sort of skin highlights as people.&rdquo; The audience is less forgiving about
human faces&mdash;even green ones. &ldquo;Green passes through yellow as it goes
to white&rdquo;, adds Sutton. &ldquo;You need to see that on a monitor in order to
counteract or accept it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Live action was shot in the streets of San Francisco, California. Jennifer
Connelly would be in the middle of a street acting to a big green guy who
isn't there. A grip holding a pole with green head on top would be her
only cue. &ldquo;They did a few really cool practical effects, explosions,
but
mainly it is CG&rdquo;, says Sutton, &ldquo;a combination of Maya and
SOFTIMAGE&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe82160"></a>
Cineon and OpenEXR</h2></div></div><p>
Capturing film images demands higher dynamic range than the typical JPEG
or PNG supports. Kodak Cineon has long been the standard for digitized
film. Cineon is a 10-bit logarithmic format. Compared to JPEG, which
is 8-bit linear (that is, 24-bit RGB), a Cineon image has more dynamic
range and is especially rich in colors near black. As computing power has
increased, most computation has switched to floating point, and working
in 10-bit log has become a limitation. OpenEXR is a new floating-point
image format.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The OpenEXR file format is a better digital representation of film
because it has a dynamic range of over 30 f-stops without loss of
precision&rdquo;, says Plumer. &ldquo;Previous 8-bit file formats have the
dynamic range of only around seven to ten f-stops and cannot accurately reproduce
images with extreme contrast.&rdquo; ILM created the EXR format in the summer
of 2000 and has used it on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Men in Black II</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gangs of
New York</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Signs</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dreamcatcher</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hulk</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Van Helsing</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Peter Pan</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Timeline</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pirates of the
Caribbean</em></span>.
</p><p>
OpenEXR uses lossless compression like PNG, not lossy compression
like JPEG. Actually, there is an unused Piz12 lossy compression
option. Unlike PNG or JPEG, OpenEXR uses wavelet encoding&mdash;basically a
tree structure containing the signed differences between pixels. Because
the magnitude of the numbers is smaller and there are fewer unique
values, Huffman encoding can compress that more efficiently. EXR
supports 32-bit float, 32-bit integer and 16-bit float to any number of
channels. Channels can be different depths; for instance, RGBAZ images
need more precision in Z depth&mdash;with 16-16-16-16-32 typical. The Z
channel is physical depth, not a color or alpha mask&mdash;think of Z sort
of like sonar. In January 2003, ILM released open-source OpenEXR. The first
open-source application to support it was CinePaint.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe82738"></a>
CinePaint</h2></div></div><p>
CinePaint, which until recently was called Film Gimp, is a frame-by-frame
motion picture retouching system that branched from GIMP in 1998. I
became the CinePaint project leader serendipitously
after I wrote some articles about Film Gimp for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In
addition to the usual still-image formats, CinePaint supports file
formats popular in the motion picture industry. Those formats include
Cineon, RnH 16-bit float (a format created by studio Rhythm &amp; Hues that
chops off half of a 32-bit float), Radiance HDR, LogLuv TIFF and now
OpenEXR. ILM wrote the OpenEXR plugin for CinePaint.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe82898"></a>
SDevs, LUTs and Lattices</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;We never want to look at an image without an appropriate SDev&rdquo;, says
Sutton. &ldquo;It's important that what you see is what you get. An SDev&mdash;a simulation device&mdash;is how we make monitors look like film. Since
switching to OpenEXR (more on that in a moment) we don't use LUTs much
anymore, but we use SDevs all the time.&rdquo; A LUT is a LookUp Table used to
adjust an image to correct gamma. Monitor brightness is not proportional
to the input voltage, but rather to the input voltage raised to a power. This
exponent is called gamma and varies depending on the display. Macs are
usually about 1.8 and PCs about 2.2.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The way LUTs work is mainly to change contrast&rdquo;, says Bogart.
&ldquo;What
a LUT can't do is increase or decrease saturation.&rdquo; Instead of LUTs, a
more complex lattice computation is used at ILM. Think of a lattice as
a 13 &times; 13 &times; 13 cube in space&mdash;a 3-D indexed array. An odd number is used
so the center is gray. In lattice, each RGB value is mapped&mdash;not like
a LUT that maps per channel. Using three independent lookup tables is
not sufficient for getting the look of film&mdash;especially with saturated
green. The lattice adjusts to a 12-point film curve using a calculated
table with 64k entries. An index into the lattice between 0 and 1 returns
three values using trilinear or tetrahedral interpolation that are then
gamma-corrected. The process is slower, because each pixel must be handled
together, but more accurate than the typical RGB channels-based lookup.
&ldquo;Lattices are not just a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hulk</em></span> thing&rdquo;, points out Bogart.
&ldquo;For <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minority
Report</em></span> that was a bleach process print&mdash;very desaturated. We simulated
that look with lattices. You can't do desaturation with LUT either.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe82cb8"></a>
GPU Programming with NVIDIA Cg</h2></div></div><p>
The raw 16-bit OpenEXR data format is called Half, as in half of a
32-bit floating-point number. The Half data format is an internal format
of NVIDIA graphics cards. It would be nice if the lattice calculation,
which consumes CPU cycles, could instead be run directly on the graphics
processing unit (GPU) on the graphics card. In fact, that's becoming
possible due to advances in graphics cards. &ldquo;We're looking forward to
that&rdquo;, says Bogart. &ldquo;We intend to offload image calculations
to the
 GPU
running a pixel shader.&rdquo; NVIDIA offers a new C-like compiler/library
called Cg to run bits of pixel code, commonly called shaders, on the
GPU. ATI offers a similar technology called High Level Shading Language,
and 3Dlabs has OpenGL Shading Language.
</p><p>
GPU programming is something like embedded systems programming, where
code is compiled on a host platform then downloaded to the embedded
system. GPU programs can be compiled and downloaded to the graphics card
at runtime. The compiler is part of the runtime library.
</p><p>
Some 3-D packages, such as SOFTIMAGE and Maya, already are beginning to
use Cg to improve rendering performance.

Modeling and Rendering</h2></div></div><p>
Alias|Wavefront Maya was used for particles and some of the character
animation models. Pixar RenderMan and Mental Images Mental Ray software
were used for rendering. Raytracing renders reflective surfaces better
but takes longer. Raytracing is becoming more practical, thanks to the
faster, cheaper Linux systems. Both RenderMan and Mental Ray support
shader programming to give images a custom look. RenderMan provides its
own shader language, which is considered easy to learn. Mental Ray uses C,
which is considered more challenging but more powerful. Which software to use
is decided on a scene-by-scene basis. Each scene is rendered under the
control of a batch scheduler.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe7a518"></a>
The ObaQ Batch Scheduler</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Florian Kines, who was also behind OpenEXR, wrote our batch scheduler
along with a couple others a long time ago for SGI Irix&rdquo;, says Hess.
&ldquo;That
made use of big iron and desktops. When we started our move to Linux we
wanted better resource management.&rdquo; The first version of ObaQ divided
machines by show&mdash;not a very efficient utilization of resources.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6783f3.large.jpg"><img src="6783f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. ILM proprietary ObaQ scheduler running a Linux batch render
for the movie <span  class="emphasis"><em>The Hulk</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Our attempt to replace ObaQ with a centralized resource management
system called the IMP Project didn't work out&rdquo;, says Hess. &ldquo;We went back
to ObaQ, and the Linux port of that took about two weeks. Three or four
months ago, Florian decided he was going to fix that so any show could
use any machine.&rdquo; ObaQ is a peer-to-peer (P2P) scheduler system. The advantage
of a P2P scheduler is that a scheduler server failure won't knock the
entire system off-line. ObaQ2 uses a single machine for global scheduling,
but it advises only independent machines running ObaQ. Losing the ObaQ2
server won't bring the entire facility down. There are scheduler system
alternatives, such as the popular proprietary
product Platform LSF or the open-source Condor and OpenPBS schedulers,
but ILM plans to continue to use ObaQ.
</p><p>
SGI had added functionality in the IRIX kernel for process monitoring,
such as CPU time and temp space. Those values determine how ILM machine
time gets charged back by central accounting to projects. ILM discovered
the Linux /proc filesystem didn't provide all those statistics or created
excessive overhead, and that it couldn't support ObaQ without changes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe7aa40"></a>
Death Star Kernel Hacking</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Florian asked me to address some of the Linux kernel issues&rdquo;, says
Hess. &ldquo;For one thing, Linux provides no way to tell if something
is a thread or a process. In <b  >ps</b>, every thread shows as a separate
process.&rdquo; Some jobs, such as Mental Ray, can run multiple threads per
frame in parallel. Linux <b  >top</b> or <b  >ps</b> shows each thread using 1GB RAM,
but that's shared memory being counted twice. Linux also couldn't tell
which job is opening temporary files. ObaQ needs to know that in order to clean up temporary
files if it kills a job.
</p><p>
Hess created a Linux kernel module to trap opens, forks, clones,
vforks, exits and renames, to make accurate statistics possible.
The kernel module does most of work, but the hooked calls
should ignore any job not being run by ObaQ. To do that required hacking
the kernel. &ldquo;I used one of the unused bits in the ptrace flag&rdquo;, says Hess.
&ldquo;Every
x86 job has a 32-bit ptrace vector. As of 2.4.20, 10 bits are used
to indicate ptrace modes, such as single step. Sometime last year Linux or
glibc changed how the ptrace flag works so it clears on fork. I found all
places the kernel clears those bits and keep bit 32.&rdquo; Hess says the
OPROFILE feature in the 2.5 kernel has enhanced accounting facilities,
so his hack might not be needed in 2.5. Commandeering an unused bit in the ptrace flag was a quick hack to
mark jobs as being ObaQ tasks. &ldquo;This is one of the great things about
Linux&rdquo;, says Hess. &ldquo;Because we had the source, we could make this change
ourselves, and very quickly. No third-party vendor had to be involved
to do custom engineering, as in the IRIX case.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe7aeb8"></a>
NFS Troubles</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Now that we have all this firepower in the renderfarm it can overwhelm
any file server&rdquo;, says Thompson. &ldquo;In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Hulk</em></span> we have these nuclear explosion
renders that are really crunchy&mdash;causing major grief for us lately. It
is easy for an artist to proc-up a render [add more processors to a task]
to the point that it brings a file server to its knees.
We're doling
out 700 times the data we used to!&rdquo;
</p><p>
ILM uses a Sun T3 disk array to serve NFS. Adopting Linux as an NFS client
presented a number of problems when brought on-line a year and a half
ago. Due to a Linux NFS UDP-packets-out-of-order bug (fixed in 2.4.18),
after a couple hours the Sun Solaris server would spin up to 100% and be
dragged down.
Sun came to the rescue with a proprietary Solaris kernel module and IP
stack patch to work around the Linux bug.
</p><p>
A nagging issue from choosing Linux NFS UDP
is no flow control. &ldquo;When we get into hot spot
problems on file servers, the renderfarm makes
a denial-of-service attack on our file servers&rdquo;,
says Thompson. &ldquo;We're going to try TCP NFS on a Linux
client again, now that it's a year and a half
later. We'll start testing that next week.&rdquo; TCP
adds about 5% overhead.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6783f3.large.jpg"><img src="6783f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. ILM's Michael Thompson and the 20TB EMC File Server
</p></div></div><p>
ILM is scaling up, from about 20TB of file server storage now to double
that next year. &ldquo;For <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars Episode III</em></span> we're going to double the
size of our renderfarm&rdquo;, says Thompson. &ldquo;We can do that by ordering
another 3,000 nodes from RackSaver&mdash;but that could destroy our file
servers.&rdquo; Thompson plans to head off that NFS server meltdown by going
to a clustered file server&mdash;Sistina GFS or something like that.
File serving isn't limited to only within the ILM facility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd89580.0xe7b540"></a>
Digital Dailies</h2></div></div><p>
ILM ships dailies worldwide over the ILM Conduit, a proprietary
file-transfer system that uses an encrypted-SSL transport. Everything is doubly
encrypted with Blowfish. ILM has playback software for Windows, Macintosh
and a Web-based Java applet version that works everywhere. &ldquo;MJPEG-A
QuickTime is our core movie container format&rdquo;, says Thompson,
&ldquo;but
Conduit can carry anything&mdash;match-move data, digital pictures, dailies.
People can play back dailies on Linux desktops across regular network
connections. That's pretty impressive. It used to be you could do
that only on SGI equipment&rdquo;. For dailies, ILM has 20TB in EMC Clarrion FC4700 arrays, fronted by 4-proc
Sun E420R servers with 4GB memory and gigabit Ethernet. &ldquo;Shot
disks&rdquo;
are arranged in quarter-terabyte chunks of storage.

The Linux Greenlight</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Linux means having incredible amounts of processing power to solve any
problem&rdquo;, says Sutton. &ldquo;In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hulk</em></span>, we had I don't know how many layers
of textures for skin and hair. We can do incredibly complex scenes
using Linux.&rdquo; What movies a studio makes is influenced by
cost and schedule. Faster, cheaper Linux means
more movies.
