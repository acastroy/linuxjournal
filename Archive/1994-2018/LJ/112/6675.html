Link your home and office securely with a
virtual private network.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adf1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in the halcyon days of the dot-com era, I was the first employee at a
P2P software startup. Because we were building an intranet and development
environment from the ground up, we were free to use Linux everywhere.
As everyone now knows, the world changed,
and the dot-coms went the way of the dodo. So too did the independence of my
little startup, which was acquired by a larger company with an established Windows
developer base. Although the new firm was liberal enough to allow me
to continue developing on and for Linux, I largely was left to fend for
myself on system administration tasks.
</p><p>
The only area where I encountered significant difficulty was with VPN
setup. At my old job, every developer had an inbound SSH port mapped
to her development workstation. Not only did the new office lock down
external access to SSH ports, the sanctioned VPN solution was not
Linux-friendly. Technical inertia guaranteed that a cross-platform
solution such as FreeS/WAN would not be available in the foreseeable
future. Fortunately, VTun, the VPN solution I used at my old job,
is flexible enough to handle even this inhospitable environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adf348"></a>How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>
VTun works by seamlessly integrating IP-tunneling technology with existing
packet routing programs. True to the UNIX spirit of modularity, VTun is
directly responsible only for tunneling packets between two systems,
leveraging established network management tools to provide a cohesive
VPN solution.
</p><p>
For the sake of analogy, imagine your home and office networks are a
set of discrete and isolated railroad networks. Each machine represents
a station. The Linux kernel controls the track switches, determining
how trains from one station reach the next. These facilities can be
manipulated through the <b  >route</b> program, allowing the end user
to add or remove destinations.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel also provides facilities for rerouting trains. For
example, let's add the Internet, a vast railroad system, to our train
station analogy. The home and office networks are merely tiny spurs in
this system. Typically, only one station, a firewall or gateway router,
has direct access to the larger Internet railroad. If another station on
the home tracks wants to dispatch trains to the Internet, these trains
first are rerouted through the gateway station. This rerouting process,
technically known as IP masquerading or network address translation (NAT),
is managed through the <b  >iptables</b> program.
<b  >iptables</b> is the
user-space half of the Netfilter firewall code in the 2.4 Linux kernel.
</p><p>
So where does VTun fit into this analogy? Recall that the home and office
networks are isolated train systems. A train from home generally is not
allowed to cross over to the work tracks due to restrictions at the
office firewall station. VTun gives us a facility to lay a virtual track
between two stations&mdash;for example, your home and office
desktops&mdash;on the separate networks. Once this track has been laid, the stations
are configured using iptables and routed such that trains
originating from home can access the work system as freely as if they
originated from the office desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adf660"></a>
Conventions and Caveats</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we've looked at the components of a VTun VPN, we are ready to
examine a complete implementation. The most obvious scenario connects a
single remote workstation (your home desktop) to the office LAN by way
of your work desktop. To keep this example simple, assume
you can establish an SSH connection to your office desktop from home
but that the machine is otherwise inaccessible from the Internet. Assume the home network is configured on the 192.168.1.0/24
subnet, and the office network has subnets 192.168.5.0/24
and 192.168.100.0/24.
</p><p>
VTun is a client/server system. The server machine listens for connections
from VTun clients on a specified port. The client initiates the creation
of the tunnel by connecting to the server port. For this example,
the home desktop is the client, and the
office desktop is the server.
</p><p>
Before we begin installation, we should take a moment to discuss
security. Creation of a VPN can mean the office network now is only
as secure as the home network. As such, it is imperative that your home
machines are protected by a firewall that is up to date on all security patches
and routinely audited for intrusion. Most importantly, never create a
VPN without the consent of your office system administrators.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adf870"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
With the caveats and disclaimers out of the way, we proceed to the fun
stuff. VTun needs to be installed on both the client and server, so the
procedure outlined below should be completed on each system. This procedure
has been tested on recent versions of Red Hat Linux. If you discover
this installation path fails for your distribution, please send me
an e-mail at <a href="mailto:ryan@ryanbreen.com">ryan@ryanbreen.com</a>. I will use these responses to track a
distribution-specific errata file at <a href="http://www.ryanbreen.com/vtun" target="_self">www.ryanbreen.com/vtun</a>.
</p><p>
Some distributions already have packages for VTun,
so you might be able to save a step by using
your package manager to install VTun from your
distribution's update site.
</p><p>
As with most VPN solutions, VTun requires the support of kernel-level
facilities, in this case provided by the TUN point-to-point network
driver. The TUN module is included in the stock kernel distribution,
so you most likely do not need to recompile your kernel. As a test,
attempt to load the driver by running <tt  >insmod
tun</tt> as root. If the
module is not found, download the latest version (currently tun-1.1)
from <a href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/index.html" target="_self">vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/index.html</a>. Install it with:
</p><pre     class="screen">
tar xzf tun-1.1.tar.gz
cd tun-1.1
su -c 'make install'
</pre><p>
If you would like the TUN module to be loaded automatically whenever a
process attempts to access the virtual tunnel device, add the following
line to /etc/modules.conf:
</p><pre     class="screen">
alias char-major-10-200 tun
</pre><p>
Next, configure and install the user-space vtund program. You can find the
latest VTun package at <a href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/download.html" target="_self">vtun.sourceforge.net/download.html</a>. For the
sake of generality, here we install from source, but if your distribution
supports RPMs or debs, feel free to grab one of the precompiled packages.
The latest source tarball at press time is vtun-2.5.tar.gz. Compilation
follows the standard procedure:
</p><pre     class="screen">
tar xzf vtun-2.5.tar.gz
cd vtun-2.5
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adfd98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Depending on your distribution, configuration might fail with an error that
LZO is not installed. LZO is a compression library used by VTun. It can be
downloaded from <a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/download" target="_self">www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/download</a>. Build
and install LZO,
then retry VTun installation.
</p><p>
Upon installation, VTun places its configuration file at
/usr/local/etc/vtund.conf. This can be extremely confusing
as the client and server need separate entries in the tunnel
specification section. To avoid confusion, I suggest moving vtund.conf
to vtund-client.conf and vtund-server.conf as appropriate. Then, manually
specify a path to the relevant configuration file on startup.
This recommendation is used throughout the following configuration discussion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adff50"></a>
VTun Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>
The VTun configuration file format is relatively straightforward
(see Listings 1 and 2). The file is organized into three discrete
units. First is a set of global options defining basic parameters, such
as server port number and paths to helper programs. Second is a set of
default session options that define the networking properties of the
tunnel. These properties can be overridden as needed in the configuration
of a specific tunnel.

</pre></div><p>
One tunnel configuration parameter that deserves special attention is
keepalive. Office system administrators often set a low
idle time on active connections through their firewalls. If your tunnel
is inactive for longer than this deadline, even a few minutes,
your connection times out. Enabling keepalive instructs
VTun to circumvent this behavior by periodically sending packets from
client to server, convincing the firewall the connection is in
active use.
</p><p>
The final unit of options defines the configuration for a specific
tunnel. The configuration file can contain any number of settings of this
type, allowing clients and servers to be involved in multiple VPNs. Each
tunnel configuration group begins with a name. I have chosen the name
my_tunnel, but the name is an arbitrary designation. Each tunnel
can configure a password, though this option generally is ignored when
the tunnel is created over SSH. The up and down blocks
describe a set of commands run when the tunnel is created and destroyed,
respectively.
</p><p>
The simple configuration files in Listings 1 and 2 instruct VTun
to create the tunnel interface on each system once the connection is
established. The configuration files use the pattern %%
to represent the tunnel interface, so multiple tunnels can be created
in any order. The actual name of the tunnel interface begins with
the prefix tun followed by a digit. The first tunnel created
is tun0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0580"></a>Creating a VTun VPN</h2></div></div><p>
Let's put this basic understanding of VTun configuration into practice,
using Listings 1 and 2 to create a simple tunnel. You can find the
Listings at <a href="../listings/112/6675.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue112/6675.tgz</a> if you would prefer not to
enter them by hand. Save vtund-server.conf to /usr/local/etc/ on the
office machine, and save vtund-client.conf to /usr/local/etc/ on the home
machine. With the config files in place, initiate the VTun processes on
each machine. As root, start the server on the office desktop:
</p><pre     class="screen">
vtund -f /usr/local/etc/vtund-server.conf -s
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0738"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The -s option tells vtund to run as the server, listening for
connections on port 5000.
</p><p>
To access the server, you must be able to reach port 5000 on the office
machine. Recall that, for the sake of this example, the office is
accessible only by SSH, so you must use OpenSSH's port-forwarding mechanism
to tunnel port 5000 from the office machine. From home, run:

<pre     class="screen">
ssh mydesktop.work.com -L 5000:localhost:5000
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae08f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The -L option tells OpenSSH to forward port 5000 on the home machine
to port 5000 on the office desktop. Connections to port 5000 on the home
machine then are tunneled transparently through SSH to port 5000 on the
office machine. This configuration has the additional benefit
of encrypting all VPN traffic.
</p><p>
With the running server on the office machine now accessible from the
home desktop, all that remains is to start the client. As root on the
home desktop, run:
</p><pre     class="screen">
vtund -f /usr/local/etc/vtund-client.conf
&#8618;my_tunnel localhost
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0aa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The my_tunnel parameter tells the client and server what
tunnel is being created. Both systems query their respective
configuration files and run the commands within the up block of
the my_tunnel stanza. The final parameter, localhost,
specifies the hostname of the VTun server. In this case, the VTun server
is localhost because you forwarded port 5000 from the home
machine to the office desktop.
</p><p>
If the tunnel was created successfully, running
<tt  >ifconfig</tt> on
each machine should list a tun0 interface. The home machine
then has an IP address of 10.3.0.1 on tun0, and
the office machine has IP 10.3.0.2. Drawing on the train
station analogy, the track between the office desktop and home desktop
has been laid, and you can now route trains between the machines over
this track. To demonstrate this, create an SSH connection from your home
desktop to 10.3.0.2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0c60"></a>
Making It Real</h2></div></div><p>
You now have a working tunnel from home to the office. Next, you need
to configure route and iptables so packets from
home are masqueraded through the work desktop to the rest of the
office LAN. Fortunately, this is as simple as adding a few lines to
the configuration files on the client and server and restarting the
vtund processes. VTun executes the appropriate
route and iptables commands when the connection is
established.
</p><p>
Returning to the train station analogy, you need to instruct the home
desktop station that any trains destined for the office network should
be routed through the newly created VTun track. You can accomplish this
manually by running:
</p><pre     class="screen">
route add -net 192.168.5.0 netmask
&#8618;255.255.255.0 gw 10.3.0.2
route add -net 192.168.100.0 netmask
&#8618;255.255.255.0 gw 10.3.0.
</pre><p>
Alternatively, you can add the commands as shown
in Listing 3 to vtund-client.conf.
These commands instruct iptables to forward all packets from the
tun interface and to masquerade these packets as coming from the office
desktop. Alternatively, we can add the commands shown in Listing 4 to
vtund-server.conf and restart the server.

Once route and iptables are configured, you should have
access to your entire corporate intranet from your home desktop. Browse
around your internal Web servers, connect to the source code server
and try exporting a graphical widget such as an xterm. Performance should
be more than adequate for all these tasks, and the SSH tunnel ensures
that all traffic is encrypted from prying eyes.
</p><p>
Now that you have a working tunnel, you may want to configure the server
to start automatically. This process is distribution-specific. The VTun tarball includes a set of init scripts for different
distributions, so you should consult the Readme to determine which will
work best for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ed95e8"></a>
Advanced Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Astute readers may have noticed that only the home desktop has
access to the office intranet. Trains originating from other stations
within the home network currently are not rerouted through the home desktop
station. I
feel that this configuration is at least marginally more secure, as it
reduces the exposure of the office network to compromises at home. If you
desire connectivity from other machines on the home network, simply add
the appropriate iptables rules to the up directive in
vtund-client.conf. I leave that as an exercise for the interested reader.
</p><p>
The above configuration works perfectly if you can connect by SSH to
any machine on your office network. Unfortunately, many offices do not
provide any open incoming ports. This was precisely the situation I found
upon arrival at my new job, but the flexibility of VTun allowed me to
overcome even this obstacle. The solution is to reverse the configuration,
using the office desktop as the VTun client and originating the SSH
tunnel from within the office.
</p><p>
To make this solution work, we must be able to access our home machine
from within the office. However, most broadband connections have dynamic
IP addresses. We can sidestep this issue by using a DNS service
tailored for dynamic IPs, such as that provided by DynDNS.org.
</p><p>
The greatest downside to this approach is its relative fragility. In
a secure setup, the client does not start automatically because the
SSH connection requires authentication, leaving you out in the cold
if the office machine goes down due to a power outage. If you are less
worried about security, you can automate login using SSH public key
authentication without a passphrase or expect scripting. I do not
encourage either method.
</p><p>
If your office machine is on a UPS, you rarely should encounter this
problem. In the six months that I have used this setup, only
one power outage lasted long enough to kill the client side of my VPN. This
setup also is robust on the home network side. You can take your machine
off-line for days, and the VPN re-initializes as soon as you start the
vtun server, thanks to the intelligent keepalive and retry facilities in
the client.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, you now have an appreciation for the versatility and
power of a VTun VPN and possess the technical know-how to set one
up for yourself. Unfortunately, a comprehensive discussion of VTun's
feature set is well beyond the scope of this article. Beyond the basic
setups described above, VTun allows Ethernet, PPP or SLIP tunneling of
protocols other than IP. VTun also provides native support for encryption,
compression and bandwidth shaping, so it is adaptable to every imaginable
connection scenario.
VTun belongs in the toolkit of every network user and
deserves mention alongside breakthrough applications such as OpenSSH,
rsync and screen.
