A triple-boot laptop with QEMU on which to run applications and learn
Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152a580.0x1622240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I bought a new laptop in spring 2006 and decided to make a serious
attempt to switch to Linux, or at least make it my primary operating
system. I already had some basic experience, having used Linux servers
at school for a few years, but I had no experience administering my own
machine. My goals for the system were simple. First and foremost, it had
to let me accomplish all my work-related tasks: computational
programming, image manipulation and producing academic papers and
presentations. Second, it had to fulfill my entertainment needs:
playing music and video of various types (including streaming media),
playing and backing up DVDs, playing games and making phone calls
over the Internet. In addition, I had the more general, underlying goal
of improving my understanding of the operation of my computer and reducing
my reliance on proprietary software.
</p><p>
As it turns out, my choice of hardware had a big impact on the result. My
laptop is a Compaq Presario V2630CA, with the following specifications:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1.8GHz AMD Turion 64 processor
</p></li><li><p>
512MB of DDR RAM
</p></li><li><p>
ATI RADEON XPRESS 200M
</p></li><li><p>
80GB hard drive
</p></li><li><p>
DVD R/RW and CD-RW combo drive with double-layer support
</p></li><li><p>
14" display
</p></li><li><p>
56k modem
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated Realtek Ethernet card
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated Broadcom BCM4318 wireless card
</p></li></ul></div><p>
After much trial and error, my current laptop is a triple-boot system,
featuring Windows XP, Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and Arch Linux 2007.08
(don't panic).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152a580.0x1622b30"></a>
Installation and Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
The first decision to make was which Linux distribution to install. In the
end, I chose Ubuntu. I had heard some pretty good things about
it, particularly with respect to its package manager and hardware
recognition. Setting up the dual-boot system was pretty easy. The computer
came with Windows pre-installed, so all I needed to do was shrink the
Windows partition and create a Linux partition structure. I used GParted,
the GNOME partition editor, which is very easy to use (Figure 1)
and can non-destructively resize partitions formatted with any common
filesystem, including NTFS, the proprietary filesystem used by Windows
XP and Vista. You shouldn't expect any data loss, but nevertheless, it's
a good idea to back up the partition before resizing it. You can burn
a bootable GParted CD or run it from the Ubuntu Live CD/DVD.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9854f1.large.jpg"><img src="9854f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Next, I created root and swap partitions in the remaining space&mdash;the
minimum needed by Linux systems&mdash;and installed Ubuntu. I later deleted
the recovery partition that came with the computer and replaced it with a
small shared partition formatted with the FAT32 filesystem, an older
DOS filesystem to which both Windows and Linux can write. When I next
repartitioned my hard drive to install a third operating system (Arch),
I replaced this with a home partition shared by both Linux distributions.
</p><p>
The Ubuntu install was pretty painless, and almost all of my hardware
worked right away. The one exception was my wireless card. I soon
discovered that it doesn't have a reliable open-source driver and is
one of the least compatible with Linux. Ubuntu comes with a native
kernel module for the card (bcm43xx), but it worked only sporadically
and tended to cause my system to freeze up completely. I tried both
the open-source NDISwrapper and Linuxant's proprietary DriverLoader,
both of which operate as wrappers for the Windows driver. For $20, you 
can get a lifetime license for DriverLoader. Both require use of Windows
driver files, bcmwl5.inf and bcmwl5.sys, which can be copied directly
from your Windows partition (if you have one) or downloaded from the Web.
</p><p>
To install DriverLoader, simply go to Linuxant's Web site and download the
installer. NDISwrapper is fully open source and comes pre-installed on
Ubuntu. To load the Windows driver, simply use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
</pre>
</p><p>
I discovered that NDISwrapper works better in low-signal environments
with unencrypted or WEP-encrypted networks, while DriverLoader is more
reliable for connecting to WPA2 networks. If you use the GNOME desktop,
NetworkManager is an excellent tool for connecting to
encrypted or unencrypted wireless networks and making VPN connections
(Figure 2). Simply install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

nm-applet&amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
I found it to be more reliable than KDE's Wireless Assistant and less
of a hassle than using scripts, as I travel a lot and often need to
connect to new wireless networks.

to available wireless networks.

One of the great things about Ubuntu is that once you install it, you're
immediately up and running with most of the stuff you'll need for
day-to-day operation, and you're notified automatically when software
updates become available. You can use Sun Microsystems' OpenOffice.org
as your office suite, the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) for
image manipulation, Totem to watch videos, Novell's Evolution or Mozilla
Thunderbird for e-mail, Mozilla Firefox for Web browsing and so on. If
you're running the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, it's also easy to install
plugins for on-line streaming video, such as Flash and Windows Media. I'd
recommend installing MPlayer and its Firefox plugin, which plays most
video formats; Flash requires a separate plugin. At the time that I was
running 64-bit Ubuntu, I was able to use Flash only by creating a 32-bit
chroot environment. Once I created the shared FAT32 partition, it was
fairly simple to share the data for my e-mail client and Web browser,
Mozilla's Thunderbird and Firefox, between Linux and Windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152a580.0x1623318"></a>
Arch Linux</h2></div></div><p>
There are several reasons to use two Linux distributions on your
laptop. My main reasons for installing Arch were: 1) I wanted to try
more Linux distributions to get an idea of which would be best for me;
2) Arch is a particularly, fast, lightweight, leading-edge distribution
with an excellent package manager; and 3) it is very different from Ubuntu
and less newbie-friendly, providing a great opportunity for learning
and customization, and it's a potential intermediate step to Gentoo or other
source-based distributions.
</p><p>
The Arch experiment proved to be quite useful for all of these reasons,
yet it's easier to use than I expected. I had psyched myself up
for a tough install, but it was only marginally more demanding than
Ubuntu. After selecting which packages to install from the CD (it
recommends installing only the base set of packages during the install
process), the installer allows you to edit certain key configuration
files. The main one, which encompasses almost all of the major
configuration, is rc.conf. This file contains your time preferences,
network configuration and selection of kernel modules and d&aelig;mons to load
at startup. The most important thing is to get your Internet connection
up and running by adding the kernel module for your Ethernet card to
the list and entering your network information.
</p><p>
Once you've installed the base system, you can install any other
applications as you need them. It will not boot automatically to a display
manager, such as the GNOME Display Manager (GDM), so you should be pretty
comfortable using a console. The package manager pacman is very easy to
use. To install a package simply execute the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pacman -S package
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, to update your system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# pacman -Syu
</pre>
</p><p>
Pacman resolves package dependencies automatically and asks
for confirmation to install the list of packages. You also can install
groups, such as gnome, kde and xfce4.
</p><p>
In addition to the supported packages, Arch also has the Arch
User-community Repository (AUR), which contains user-contributed templates
allowing you to install additional applications easily from source using
the makepkg utility. To install them, simply download the PKGBUILD file
from the AUR Web site, and run the following in the directory to which you
downloaded it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# makepkg -si
</pre>
</p><p>
The -si options are optional and instruct makepkg to install any
dependencies that are in the supported Arch repositories and to install
the package itself after compiling it. There also are pacman front ends
that add support for AUR, allowing you to install AUR packages and
keep them up to date easily. For example, yaourt lets you upgrade all
packages by executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# yaourt -Syu -aur
</pre>

Software: Open Source vs. Proprietary</h2></div></div><p>
I need a certain amount of software for scientific and graphical
purposes,
and there's a large amount of open-source and proprietary software
out there, some of which my institution had licenses for. One of my
goals in using Linux was to use as much free, open-source software as
possible. I was already familiar with some excellent scientific software
that was installed on my group's servers, such as Paul Wessel and Walter
Smith's Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and the graphing application Grace,
but not the day-to-day software that I needed for my laptop.
</p><p>
The most basic need for people typically is office software. The natural
choice for users of Microsoft's Office suites is OpenOffice.org,
which essentially performs the same functions. It is able to open
and save documents in Office formats or print directly to PDF. I use
OpenOffice.org's Impress to prepare conference presentations and lectures,
Write for writing papers and Spreadsheet for spreadsheets. However,
there are a couple of caveats. First, some types of images are strongly
aliased when displayed in slideshow mode in Impress; however, this is easily
solved by converting the presentation to PDF. Second, equations created
in Word cannot be edited in Write, and vice versa.
</p><p>
The main specialized proprietary applications that I use are the
MathWorks' MATLAB (an excellent programming environment that can
be installed in Linux) and CorelDRAW (graphical software). The
simplest open-source alternative is GNU's Octave, which is in most
ways a clone of MATLAB. It is quite easy to use Octave as a drop-in
MATLAB replacement, as it uses the same language as MATLAB. With some
exceptions, most computational scripts written for MATLAB will run
correctly in Octave. The one major exception is graphics. Although MATLAB has
an integrated graphical user interface (GUI) and graphics handler, Octave
interfaces with several different GUIs and plotting applications. Gnuplot
is the default plotter, but it isn't ideal for producing publication-quality
graphics. I use the Koctave GUI with Octplot or Grace for plotting (Figure 3); both are pretty good, although only Grace allows you to make
changes to a graph once it has been created. MATLAB's main advantage is
that it is significantly faster and easier to use. On the other hand,
you can install Octave on as many machines as you like, so it may be
convenient to use both if you have a MATLAB license.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9854f3.large.jpg"><img src="9854f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, I didn't find any Linux software that could replace CorelDRAW. However, the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a great
tool for image processing. It's very user-friendly and performs many of
the functions of Adobe Photoshop or Corel PHOTO-PAINT. Many
excellent open-source applications exist for playing music and video that are
as good as or better than their proprietary equivalents. If you're using
KDE, Amarok does an excellent job of organizing your music and radio
stations. If you prefer GNOME (as I do), you'll likely go with Banshee
or Exaile. I also use GNOME's Totem for playing DVDs and MPlayer for
most other video formats.
</p><p>
If you want to use your laptop to make phone calls when you're on the
go, open source is the way to go. Ubuntu comes with the Ekiga softphone
built in, and several other open-source and proprietary softphones
are available&mdash;most free of charge. In addition, the most common VoIP
(Voice over IP) protocol, SIP, is open source, allowing you to make 
free calls to anyone using that protocol. By contrast, Skype users can
call only other Skype users for free.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152a580.0x1623c60"></a>
Virtualization</h2></div></div><p>
If you still need (or want) to run Windows applications&mdash;in my case,
CorelDRAW and Word&mdash;you have a few options. First, you can create
a multiple-boot system, as described above. However, if you use only a
few Windows applications, you may be able to run them using CodeWeavers'
Wine or CrossOver Office. Wine is free, whereas CrossOver Office is a
beefed-up commercial product based on Wine; a license for the Standard
version will run you $39.95. They work well for several popular Windows
applications, such as Microsoft Office 1997&ndash;2003, iTunes and Internet
Explorer, but don't count on being able to run your favorite programs.
</p><p>
A third and, in my opinion, more fun option is to install your copy of
Windows on a virtual machine using virtualization software, allowing
you to run it within Linux. An excellent open-source solution, Fabrice
Bellard's QEMU, provides full hardware virtualization. Following the
tutorial listed in the Resources for this article, it's quite easy to install QEMU, create a hard
disk image and install your copy of Windows (or any other operating
system). Once you have the guest operating system running, you can
transfer files to and from it by passing in a USB device or mounting
the disk as a loopback device (although you will not be able to write
to it if it uses the NTFS filesystem). Alternatively, you can set up a
network connection between the host and guest OS using TUN/TAP networking
and transfer files via FTP. This method also gives you the option of
allowing the guest OS access to the Internet, although there are obvious
advantages to isolating your Windows install. Here's my QEMU startup
script as an example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

ARGS="-boot c -kernel-kqemu -net nic,vlan=0 -net
tap,vlan=0,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -m 512 -localtime -cdrom /dev/hdc -usb
-usbdevice host:xxxx:xxxx -std-vga -full-screen xp.img"

exec qemu $ARGS
</pre>
</p><p>
The performance is quite good if you use the kqemu acceleration module,
particularly if you have a dual-core processor, but I wouldn't recommend
running resource-intensive programs. If you're running on batteries,
keep in mind that running a virtual machine consumes a lot of power.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152a580.0x161a758"></a>
The Linux Edge</h2></div></div><p>
What are the advantages of a Linux laptop? The main advantage of Linux in
general is the degree of control it gives you over your computer. This
is even more important on a laptop, where you have limited
resources&mdash;particularly with respect to memory and storage. Linux permits a degree
of customization that is impossible in any other environment. For example,
you can run a stripped-down Arch Linux with the lightweight Fluxbox window
manager for a memory- and power-efficient system. Or, if you're plugged
in, you can boot into a full-featured Ubuntu system with GNOME or KDE and
a powerful composite window manager, such as Novell's Compiz or Beryl, a
Compiz fork developed by Quinnstorm (Figure 4). For those who enjoy
a little razzle-dazzle, take a look at what these window managers can do
on YouTube. My Ubuntu/Arch/Windows setup gives me the flexibility I need
to work (or play!) wherever I am. Arch provides a lightning-fast,
stripped-down system with reduced power usage, and Ubuntu provides a full-featured,
easy-to-use system with an excellent package manager to reduce bloat.

Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>
I would like to thank Anthony Egan, my system administrator at
Washington University, without whom I probably would never have dared to
install Linux on my laptop. He helped me with many of the issues
mentioned here and was always available to talk Linux.
