How to make NDISwrapper work with different wireless devices.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abe240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Using a wireless connection on Linux still is a dicey thing, and you must
acknowledge the fact that you probably will have to go a non-open-source
software direction, if you want to have any chance of getting
connected. A lot of development is happening in this realm, but let's face
it,
making wireless devices work natively with open-source drivers is not
something you can count on, at least for the time being.
</p><p>
What's the reason for this state of affairs? Just as with graphics
cards, there are many factors. Vendors are quite interested in
offering newer devices, but the majority of them do not care about Linux and have
a
Windows-only mindset. Furthermore, if you purchase a laptop,
you may not even have the option to choose the card, so you 
have to make do with whatever you are dealt. Finally, developers cannot 
produce the needed software when manufacturers won't
release the specs, APIs and so on for their products, and this
documentation almost never is available.
</p><p>
Thus, unless you are quite lucky and happen to have one of the few
open-source-supported options, NDISwrapper probably will be your best
option; however,
it's no surefire silver bullet. NDISwrapper tries to provide a
wrapper around Windows drivers, so Linux can use them as if they
were native ones. If you are lucky (okay, not so much lucky, as many drivers
seem to work), your Linux machine will think it has perfectly fine drivers and
will use them.
</p><p>
Though the program itself is open source, this usage of proprietary
drivers is objectionable (maybe even not 100% legal?) and obviously not
guaranteed. Furthermore, it's still a bit of a hit-or-miss,
not very well documented and somewhat obscure method. There's no fancy graphic
interfaces here, only old-fashioned command-line work, with many
possibilities 
for mistakes. Taking all of this into account, it's no wonder many
people become
conscientious objectors of NDISwrapper or end up not being able to make it work.
</p><p>
Hopefully, in the near future, this will be a moot point, and we will
have full open-source software for most, if not all, wireless cards.
Certainly,
such drivers 
exist for a select few. In the meantime, we have to make do with
this sort of kludge&mdash;even though NDISwrapper is brilliant, it's a pity
we have to rely on such a program&mdash;and wait for better times.
</p><p>
I recently got a somewhat old eMachines M5305 laptop, and as I
had to work in a wireless-only office, I had no option but to get
wireless going. In this article, I explain how I installed two
different kinds of cards (USB and PCI) and got them to function with
NDISwrapper. I won't dwell on the many other alternatives I tried
(which got me nowhere) and focus on the NDISwrapper solution. Being purely
practical, I needed my box to work&mdash;open-source software or not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abe608"></a>
What Is NDISwrapper?</h2></div></div><p>
NDISwrapper stands for Network Driver Interface Spec Wrapper. A
wrapper is a technical name for a piece of software that, loosely
speaking, allows you to use something in a somewhat different way. 
Using Windows drivers under Linux certainly qualifies
as &ldquo;using something in a somewhat different way&rdquo;.
</p><p>
You can find NDISwrapper in most modern distributions. Either
use the provided repositories, or go to the NDISwrapper site (see
Resources), download the source files and
install them yourself. As a matter of fact, even though I use OpenSUSE
10.2 and NDISwrapper was readily available, I opted to go that route
myself,
so as to get the most up-to-date version. At the time of this writing, the current stable version
stands at 1.47, and there is a 1.48RC2 release candidate in the works,
but I decided to go with the former.
</p><p>
If you already had a version of NDISwrapper on your system, it might be
best to uninstall it first (using the tools in your
distribution&mdash;I used YaST), and then, as a common user, go to wherever
you downloaded the file, and do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar zxvf ndiswrapper-1.47
cd ndiswrapper-1.47
make distclean
make
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, as root, type <tt  >make install</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abe920"></a>
First Experiment: the USB Method</h2></div></div><p>
I went to a nearby computer shop and found a cheap, nice USB wireless
adapter, Allied Telesyn's AT-WCU201G model, which supports speeds up
to 108Mbps and is compatible with IEEE 802.11, 802.11b and 802.11g. Of
course, today, speeds of 54Mbps are more common, so it's nice having
an extra speed reserve resource.
</p><p>
Because this is a USB device, you
can use the lsusb command to get the device ID. Insert the device at
any USB slot, and do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lsusb
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 3242:4001
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
</pre>
</p><p>
It's pretty clear our device's ID is 3242:4001. If you want more
information&mdash;there's lots of it&mdash;about the device, try
<tt  >lsusb -d 3242:4001 -v</tt>,
and you can verify the manufacturer, product code, serial number and
so on. It's highly likely that other people already will have tried their
hands at getting the device to work, so I Googled it on-line to see if there
was any help or
known good Linux drivers. I didn't find any useful references,
but I went on ahead anyway&mdash;did you expect to give up so easily?
</p><p>
If you're following along, you will need a Windows XP driver, both the .inf and the .sys files.
Fortunately, the product I chose includes a CD with several appropriate drivers,
and it's just a matter of copying it to disk. Note that possibly not all
Windows drivers will work or be stable. Sometimes you may discover you
need to try alternate drivers to get your card to work. Also, the vendor
might have included the needed files within an EXE file (try unzipping
it and see if you get what you need) or a CAB file.
</p><p>
In my particular case, it was easy&mdash;just a matter of copying some files
(atiwu.inf and atiwu.sys) and then typing <tt  >ndiswrapper -i
atiwu.inf</tt>, followed by <tt  >ndiswrapper -m</tt>
and then <tt  >ndiswrapper -l</tt> 
to list all drivers. I got:

<pre     class="programlisting">
atiwu : driver installed
        device (3242:4001) present
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abed98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which shows that the device was recognized and the driver was
installed. Now, it's time to let Linux know more
about the new device. Because I use OpenSUSE, I opened YaST and went to
Network Devices&rarr;Network Card&rarr;Add, and selected the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Device type: wireless.
</p></li><li><p>
Configuration name: 0 (so the device will be known as wlan0).
</p></li><li><p>
Hardware configuration name: static-2 (whatever).
</p></li><li><p>
Module name: ndiswrapper (most important).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Do not choose PCMCIA or BUS. Then, go through the next screens (pick either
DHCP or an IP, specify your DNS servers and so on), until you come to the
Wireless Device Settings form. There, you probably will have to set the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Operating mode: managed (ad hoc would work for a peer-to-peer network).
</p></li><li><p>
Network name: Guiamovil (the name of the network to which I wanted to connect).
</p></li><li><p>
Authentication mode: WPA-PSK (open would work for an unrestricted,
unprotected, passwordless network).
</p></li><li><p>
Key input type and encryption key: whatever the network administrator 
tells you to use. (Of course, you don't need this for an
&ldquo;open&rdquo; network.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can leave all these changes out, however, if you don't know to what
network you will be connecting. Simply exit the program, save all the
changes, and you will have device wlan0 available. We are almost there!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abf5d8"></a>
How Do I Connect?</h2></div></div><p>
If you made it this far, you can use the wireless tools, which include
iwconfig and iwlist, to configure your device and search for available
networks. (Of course, there are many similar tools, some even have graphic
interfaces; look around if you so desire.) In my situation, I already
knew the
network to which I wanted to connect, but in other cases (Wi-Fi hot areas
at airports, for example), you would need to look around to find one.
</p><p>
You can scan for networks with <tt  >iwlist wlan0</tt>, and
you'll get something
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
Great, the connection I wanted is there (the second one, Guiamovil),
and also another open, unprotected one called Linksys. (The unchanged
name is a giveaway that the wireless router was installed without any
specific configuration.)
</p><p>
If you would rather use the command line, iwconfig allows configuring
the wireless device. Try <tt  >iwconfig --help</tt> or
<tt  >man iwconfig</tt> to learn
more about this. For example, I could get the same results that I did with
YaST by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iwconfig wlan0 essid "Guiamovil" mode managed key 
"s:THESECRETPASSWORD" commit
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you simply can ping any site to check how the device is working
or connect to the Web and surf along.

Second Experiment: the PCMCIA Method</h2></div></div><p>
A friend of mine loaned me a PCMCIA card, so I could test 
a different kind of device. I first thought about removing the USB driver
and setup and then installing his card, but that would have been sort of
lame. Anyway, just to make sure the card worked, I tried it, starting with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ndiswrapper -r atiwu
rm /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper
cd /path.where.you.downloaded.ndiswrapper
make uninstall
make clear
make
make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c6580.0x1abfbb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to get back to square zero. I then inserted the card into its slot and
used the <tt  >lspci</tt> and <tt  >lspci -v</tt> commands to learn more about it. I found
the card at the bottom of the listing, and the second command produced
its ID (11ab:1faa):


<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
This time, Googling for 11ab:1faa was lucky. I found several references
saying that the card worked well, so I went ahead and installed it using
the same method as with the USB card. It worked just fine&mdash;it was almost
anticlimactic.
</p><p>
Now, back to the original idea of installing both devices at the same
time. I wasn't even sure if NDISwrapper could handle
two drivers at the same time, and when I searched the Web, I found
nothing. Plowing ahead, I decided to experiment a bit. It turns
out that the /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper file read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias wlan0 ndiswrapper
</pre>
</p><p>
So, I added an <tt  >alias wlan1 ndiswrapper</tt> line to it, just to see if
it made any difference. I went back to the beginning (uninstalled everything),
rebooted (just in case) and started again. After setting up both
devices, I tried <tt  >iwconfig</tt> and happily saw that both interfaces were
recognized. I could remove either of them, and the other still worked fine. I
noted that the Allied Telesyn USB device was more sensitive&mdash;it could
find more remote networks&mdash;than the Netgear card, but I guess that's
reasonable, as the former is newer and could be expected to be more potent.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Even though wireless devices are still a low point for Linux, using
NDISwrapper provides a good solution, if you are not dogmatic about
proprietary binary drivers or using Windows software on your Linux box. I
would prefer an OSS solution, but I can't wait for it. There are
no guarantees, of course, but my experiments convinced me that getting
wireless to work should be an easy job, and I was able to make two different devices 
work at the same time, which attests to the quality of NDISwrapper.
