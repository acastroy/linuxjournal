Wanting to know more about the company and what makes it tick, I sat
down (in a virtual sense) with Grubby Games' cofounder and programmer
Ryan Clark.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Thanks for agreeing to this interview. First off, how long 
has Grubby Games been around, and perhaps more to the point, how long 
have you been making Linux games?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Grubby Games was founded in 2004, and we've been making Linux games 
the entire time.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: What about the games available for sale on your site that run only on 
Windows and/or the Mac platform?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: The games on our site that do not run on Linux were created by other 
developers; we sell those games as affiliates. All of the games we 
have developed (and will develop) run on Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: That's good to hear! What led to your decision to support Linux with all of 
your offerings?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: We chose to make Linux games because I personally always have wished that 
there were more games for Linux. It seems that others share my 
sentiment, as we have received a number of e-mails from Linux users, 
thanking us profusely for making our games available for Linux. (We 
also get our share of comments from Linux users who are angry because 
our games are not free/open source!)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Do you think you might ever release your games or any of your 
animation/rendering or other libraries under an open-source license? 
I'm thinking of something along the lines of what id did with
<span class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and 
<span class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> when after the commercial benefit of the games
had passed, they 
released the source code to the engine (but not the levels themselves) 
under an open-source license.</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: I hope we'll be able to do that at some point, yes. However, we already do 
it in a manner of speaking, through another Web site we run: The Game 
Programming Wiki (<a href="http://gpwiki.org" target="_self">gpwiki.org</a>).
</p><p>
I've written a number of articles for the wiki, many of which describe 
the exact same methods I use in our games. And on the GPWiki forums, I 
do my best to answer any questions people may have.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: I'll have to check that out. What percentage of your sales come from Linux 
versions of your games?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: About 2%, although I do know that a number of people have purchased Windows 
or Mac versions of our games because they want to (indirectly) support 
our Linux efforts.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Good for them! Do you think the market is ready for more commercial Linux 
game studios?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: It's hard to say. We certainly wouldn't be able to afford to do what we do 
if we were Linux-only. However, I do think that more studios should 
consider making Linux versions of their games. Many already support 
Windows and Mac; it's not much harder to support Linux too. Not 
supporting Linux is just like throwing away money.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: So, at least for now, is the cross-platform approach the best way to
go?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: As I said, we certainly couldn't survive on the money we currently make 
from the Linux versions of our games. However, we're definitely not 
reaching all of the potential Linux customers that we could be.
</p><p>
If we're currently reaching only 2% of potential Linux customers, then 
yes, we could survive by making Linux-only games, if we could somehow 
reach 100% of them. And I'm confident that we're probably reaching 
less than 2%, at present. But how do you reach the rest of them? We 
haven't found any cost-effective way to do it. Expensive advertising 
campaigns surely would help expand our reach, but likely would not 
benefit our bottom line.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: How much of your code is fully cross-platform?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: More than 99%. We have platform-specific code only for a few things, like 
locating a good place to store user profile data, or opening a Web 
browser.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: How hard is it to support all three OS platforms
simultaneously?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Really not that hard. The tricky bit is not the coding, it's the 
deployment on each platform. But even the deployment is easy once you 
find a system that works well for you. With each release, it becomes 
easier and more automatic for us.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Do you have any games currently in development that you can tell us
about?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: We have three games in development, but they are all in their very
early stages,
so we're not quite ready to divulge any secrets. But, I can tell you 
that they'll all run on Linux, of course. We're branching out in a few 
new directions, so expect to see some cool new stuff.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: I'm excited to see them! Are you the head programmer/only programmer on 
these new games?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: I was the only programmer when we started in 2004, but we now have
three
programmers on staff. Programmers work on their own games; we
feel that it's more efficient to run three projects with one programmer
each than one project with three programmers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: All three of your current games ship with a ton of levels. How do you 
decide when you have created enough levels and are ready to
ship?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: We usually aim for a certain minimum amount of play time. (We want to make 
sure our customers feel like they got good value for their money.) As 
a result, our games tend to have a minimum of about six hours of 
game play. If you are superhuman, and you play through all the 
levels without any sort of hiccup, you can finish our games in around 
that amount of time.
</p><p>
In reality, our games will last much longer than that, of course. I
seriously doubt anyone could solve all of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor
Fizzwizzle</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor
Fizzwizzle and the Molten Mystery</em></span> levels in less 
than a full-time week. The games also provide replay value through 
high-score systems, trophies or level editors with downloadable levels 
made by other users.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Speaking of the level editors, was their inclusion a planned feature from
the get-go, or was it a &ldquo;well, it's built, so we might as well include 
it&rdquo; kind of thing?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: A level editor just felt like a natural addition. If people enjoy solving 
puzzles, some percentage of them also will enjoy creating puzzles. It 
was an easy way to add replayability to the games, and a way to build 
community.
</p><p>
Also, we just really wanted to see what people would come up with. I 
was very pleased the first time someone stumped me at my own game.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Are any of you still creating levels for the games and posting them
on-line,
or are you all too busy creating the next great Grubby Games
game?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: I check out levels created by the community, but I rarely post new ones 
myself. As you say, we are very busy working on the next batch of 
games.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Seeing as your games run on the big three OS platforms, which one do you do 
your primary development on?</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Our first game, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span>, was developed entirely on Linux. 
Since then, we've moved over to Mac OS X. The reason for the move is 
Parallels Desktop. Parallels allows us to run Windows and Linux as 
virtual machines, from Mac OS X. As a result, we can develop and test 
for all three platforms on one machine, without needing to reboot&mdash;very 
handy.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Very handy indeed&mdash;I'm a big fan of virtualization myself. On a slightly 
related note, I do have to say that my favorite game of the three is 
<span class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span>. When you were in the planning stages, how did you come up 
with the idea for this game? It's a wonderfully crazy cross between 
<span class="emphasis"><em>Katamari Damacy</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span>.</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Matt and I are both huge fans of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Katamari Damacy</em></span>, so I think it
influences our thinking somewhat. We're also fans of 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>Arkanoid</em></span>, but felt that there were a few major shortcomings of 
the genre: the &ldquo;last brick problem&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;lack of
control&rdquo; problem.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;last brick problem&rdquo; is likely familiar to you: you've got one
brick left in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span>, but you can't quite seem to
hit it&mdash;so
frustrating! We feel we solved this problem in a number of ways.
First, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Katamari</em></span>-ness of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span> means that the ball grows over
time. The large end-game ball makes it easier to hit any target you
might be aiming at. Second, since you're supposed to be rescuing
animals rather than breaking things, you don't actually have to
destroy everything on the level.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;lack of control&rdquo; problem lies in the pinball-like nature of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span>: after you hit the ball, you have nothing to do until it
comes back down. We addressed this problem by introducing
&ldquo;fans&rdquo;
that allow you to alter the ball's trajectory while it is in flight.
This allows skilled players to achieve large combos, collect hard-to-get
trophies, and it makes <span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span> less of a
&ldquo;waiting game&rdquo; than
traditional <span   class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span> titles.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Yes, you did solve both of those issues quite well, and I'm working my way 
through the last few trophies. Finally, I wanted to ask you about who 
created the levels on <span class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle 
and the Molten Mystery</em></span>? Some of them (especially the ones in the 
advanced level sets) are insanely hard! I'm almost convinced that you 
have a secret team of psychotic chess geniuses on your staff.</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Matt and I created almost all of the levels for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor
Fizzwizzle</em></span>, 
even the advanced ones. It was a challenge to make so many levels, but 
a lot of fun too. For <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle and the Molten
Mystery</em></span>, 
we hired level designers to help us. In fact, to find the best level 
designers, we simply chose from the players who already were submitting 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span> levels to our Web site! Jarod and Lior did an 
amazing job for us.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DB: Yes they did. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us
today.</b></span>
</p><p>
RC: Thanks Daniel! It's been fun.

The Games</h2></div></div><p>
With the interview over, it was time to kick my kids off of my computer and
discover for myself what these games do right, and what they don't.
</p><p>
Grubby Games' current trio of games can be split into two types. First,
there's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>PF</em></span>)
and its sequel, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle
and the Molten Mystery</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span>). Both are puzzle games where
the object is to get the Professor from the starting point to the ending
point utilizing various gadgets and objects along the way.
</p><p>
Second, there's <span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span>, which is completely different. It is an
arcade-type game in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Arkanoid</em></span> tradition with very little in the way
of puzzle solving.
</p><p>
All three of the games are suitable (and fun) for all ages, from 3&ndash;103.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x23aca08"></a>
Purchasing the Games</h2></div></div><p>
Because I so seldom purchase Linux software, it felt weird when I bought
the games. Despite the strange &ldquo;I'm buying a game for Linux!&rdquo; feeling,
the actual process was very easy. Essentially, it's the same as purchasing
anything else on-line.
Your receipt and the games themselves are delivered to you via special
links that are sent to you by e-mail.
</p><p>
The games range in size from 10&ndash;20MB, so if you're on a slow
Internet connection, you may want to leave the downloads running overnight
so that they'll be finished and waiting for you in the morning. I was
able to download them in just a few minutes.
</p><p>
After the download is complete, you will have a .tar.gz file (or two or
three) sitting in front of you waiting to be unpacked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x23acc18"></a>
Installation and First Run</h2></div></div><p>
The games are distributed as .tar.gz files, and untarring them is how
they are installed. I put mine into /usr/local/share/games/grubby/,
but they could live anywhere on your system.
</p><p>
Start the games using a shell script called <tt  >run.sh</tt>
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>PF</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span>. On <span   class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span>, the game is
started with script called <tt  >run.cmd</tt>. It
would have been nice if all three were named consistently. A
graphical shell script installer of some sort, like CrossOver Office,
would be another alternative. Quibbles aside, the .tar.gz method will,
at least, work almost everywhere.
</p><p>
One of the first things I did after unpacking the files was to create
some launchers for my GNOME panel, so that I didn't have to launch the
games from the command line. The icons included are ugly, at least
they're there.
</p><p>
Launch the games from the command line the first time you run them, just
to be sure they're working properly. When run in this way, you will get
some helpful diagnostic output in your terminal if things aren't quite
right. In the case of <span   class="emphasis"><em>PF</em></span>, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> launch the game from the command
line the first time, because it asks you which sound system and driver to
use. I'm very glad the two more recent games have eliminated this step.
</p><p>
I think the command-line oriented installation process on all three of
these games, although relatively painless for me, could be a big stumbling
block to nontechnical Linux users. Additionally, such a manual install
process is out of character with the otherwise very good-looking
games. I hope they come up with a better method for future games.
</p><p>
There also were some libraries I had to install on my Ubuntu 7.04 box
to get the games to work right: zlib1g-dev and libpng3 for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span> and
libsdl-ttf2.0-0 for <span   class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span>.
</p><p>
Installation and library issues aside, once the games are up and running,
they look and sound great. They're all very polished&mdash;exactly what I
expect from games I paid real money to get.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x23ad248"></a>
Game Play</h2></div></div><p>
Each game starts up into an easy-to-use menu system that you can navigate
either with your mouse or keyboard. The Preferences section of
each game lets you set things like whether to play fullscreen or in a
window, the volume of music and sound effects and
so on. Everything is simple and well organized.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x23ad350"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
The focus of the two <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span> games is on puzzle solving. The
easiest, or &ldquo;kid's&rdquo; levels, are basic runs from one side of the screen
to the other, often with neat pictures built out of different level parts
filling the screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f1.large.jpg"><img src="9858f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. One of the Kid Levels from <span  class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
The other levels are divided into &ldquo;regular&rdquo; and
&ldquo;advanced&rdquo;. These range
from fairly easy to nearly impossible.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f2.large.jpg"><img src="9858f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. One of the Advanced Levels from <span  class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
The replayability of individual levels in each of these games is not very
high, because once you know how to beat a level, you easily can do so at any
future time (unless, of course, you're like me and forget). Thankfully, the
games come with enough levels to keep you busy for a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> time. What
keeps my children coming back to these two games are the level editors
built into each one.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f3.large.jpg"><img src="9858f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The <span  class="emphasis"><em>PFMM</em></span> Level Editor
</p></div></div><p>
My kids spend hours fiddling and perfecting their levels, and I have
to say, I'm impressed with the sophistication of some of their best
ones. I've even taken a stab at level design myself and came up with a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>-themed level that, although not very hard to beat, was still
fun to make.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f4.large.jpg"><img src="9858f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. My <span  class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Level
</p></div></div><p>
I've uploaded my level to the Grubby Games Web site, so feel free to give
it a try.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x23ae060"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
If you are more action-oriented than puzzle-oriented (like me),
give <span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span> a try. The object in this game is to collect all the
animals. There are crates and rocks and trees and even aliens in your
way. You play by bouncing your fizzball off of these obstacles while
making sure you don't let the ball get past you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f5.large.jpg"><img src="9858f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The ball starts out small in <span  class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span>...
</p></div></div><p>
At the start of a level, your fizzball is small and can pick up
only nuts, apples and butterflies. As you collect more food and animals,
your ball gets bigger and bigger, allowing you to collect even larger
animals. Everything literally snowballs, and by the end of the level, you
should have a pretty substantial fizzball bouncing around the screen
collecting animals and destroying every crate and fence that gets in
the way. You beat levels by collecting all the animals.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9858f6.large.jpg"><img src="9858f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. ...but it keeps growing the more animals you catch.
</p></div></div><p>
The game has a ton of power-ups to keep things interesting, and there
also are special achievements you can collect for beating levels
in a certain way.
</p><p>
One of my favorite features is that the kid difficulty level has a
bumper along the bottom of the screen that prevents you from losing your
fizzball. This makes the game playable even for very young children.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eba580.0x22bf050"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You can't go wrong with any of these games. If I had to choose between
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professor
Fizzwizzle and the Molten Mystery</em></span>
I would go with the latter, simply because it has more gadgets, harder
puzzles and a better level editor. However, if I could choose only one
of the three, I would choose <span   class="emphasis"><em>FizzBall</em></span>.
</p><p>
There are demos of the games at the Grubby Games Web site, so you can
try before you buy. If you do decide to purchase one or more of them,
I can honestly say that they're all worth the price. Games are $19.94 each,
but there's a $5 discount if you bundle more games with your purchase. Now, if you'll excuse
me, there's this one level that I have to get back to....
