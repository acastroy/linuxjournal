Who says you need a fancy high-end graphics card to play some great Linux
games? Heck, who says you need graphics at all?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b49580.0x1c413a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Three frames per minute? Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois, I would call that pretty
bad performance. While I admire your desire to reuse old hardware to
build your Linux desktop, I have to say that your new system might be a
little underpowered for running <span   class="emphasis"><em>FlightGear</em></span>. Of
course, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, it
is a great game, but you need a more powerful system and an accelerated
3-D graphics card. Now, don't look so sad, Fran&ccedil;ois. Our guests will be
here shortly, and tonight's menu features some great games that you can
run on the most basic of systems. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non</em></span>, you must wait
until our
guests arrive.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> They are approaching as we speak. Prepare
yourself,
Fran&ccedil;ois. Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of
fine
wines and excellent Linux and open-source software. Our wine cellar,
as you know, is one of the world's finest, and yet, even our selection
pales in comparison to the number of great open-source projects. Luckily,
there is a wine for all packages. Please sit, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
while Fran&ccedil;ois makes his way to the wine cellar. Please, Fran&ccedil;ois,
bring back the 2002 Chassagne-Montrachet &ldquo;Champ Gains&rdquo;.
While we wait
for the wine, let's talk about great gaming action with minimal
resources.
</p><p>
Playing fast-paced arcade games doesn't necessarily require high-end
hardware. In fact, you can find games that don't require a graphics card
at all. I know what you are thinking. Chef Marcel has been sampling a
little more wine than usual today. Although that may be true (a little
joke,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?), it hasn't clouded my judgment. The items on
tonight's menu
are all text- or ncurses-based games, and all you need to play them is
your Linux system and an open terminal window. Now, you aren't likely to
find most of these packages in your favorite distribution's repository,
but never fear. Given the simplicity of these packages, you'll find they
pretty much compile without fuss and without the need for a lot of extra
libraries&mdash;just use the extract-and-build five-step.
</p><p>
Way back when your humble Chef spent his hard-earned quarters at the
video arcade, he particularly enjoyed defending Earth from invading
aliens. The year was 1978, and the game was <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space
Invaders</em></span>. Even today,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span> is still a hugely popular game. I
actually ran across
two versions of the old <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span>
game&mdash;one somewhat more text-heavy than
the other. The first is Thomas Munro's <span   class="emphasis"><em>ASCII
Invaders</em></span> (Figure
1). This one is definitely the textiest (is there such a word?),
and it's very true to the spirit of the original game. Visit his site at
<a href="http://www.ip9.org/munro/invaders/index.html" target="_self">www.ip9.org/munro/invaders/index.html</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f1.large.jpg"><img src="9901f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. All the
Action of the Original <span  class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span> in Glorious
ASCII
</p></div></div><p>
My guess is that I don't have to tell you how to play this
game. There's a gun platform at the bottom of the screen that you move
left and right with cursor keys. Press the spacebar to fire and try to
get all the aliens before they come down and blow you away. Occasionally,
flying saucers will sail overhead. These are worth more, so make sure you
get those when you can. It's easy to play, but hard to win. Keep moving
and stay alive long enough to fight the next wave.
</p><p>
Before we move on to the next text-based game, let's look at yet
another <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span> clone, mostly because it's
handled a little
differently to provide alternative graphics. This one is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nInvaders</em></span> (Figure 2), and it comes to us from Thomas
Dettbarn
and friends over at <a href="http://ninvaders.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ninvaders.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f2.large.jpg"><img src="9901f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <span  class="emphasis"><em>nInvaders</em></span> is
a somewhat more colorful <span  class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span> clone.
</p></div></div><p>
Do you remember a game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Boulder Dash</em></span> and its
hero, Rockford? The
premise of the game involved a prospector searching for diamonds
and other gems underground (another, similar game available for
your Linux system is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rocks &amp; Diamonds</em></span>). To get
to the gems, our hero
needed to dig his way through the ground, avoiding falling rocks and
cave-ins, both of which spelled certain doom. Tom Rune Flo's very cool
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cavez of Phear</em></span> (Figure 3) is available from
<a href="http://www.x86.no/cavezofphear" target="_self">www.x86.no/cavezofphear</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f3.large.jpg"><img src="9901f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Enter the
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Cavez of Phear</em></span> where Death awaits...what's with all
this Death?
</p></div></div><p>
To start the game, run the program, <tt  >phear</tt>. An
ASCII
underground cave system will be created for you, complete with diamonds
located in hard-to-reach places with boulders ready to cave in on your
Z-head if you aren't careful. The game screen tracks your score, lives
and, most important, the number of diamonds you need to collect in
order to advance to the next screen (Figure 4).
</p><p>
Cursor keys let you navigate through the caves. If you get totally
trapped in a cave, which can happen with a cave-in, pressing the
K key provides you with an easy way to commit suicide
(your ASCII self, not you). Collect bombs (which appear as %
symbols), pressing B to place them and T to detonate
them. Bombs, as I'm sure you know, can help you get out of otherwise
impossible situations. Oh yes, there also are the monsters (shown
as letter Ms). Whatever you do, don't let the monsters touch
you, because they will kill you. Did I mention that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cavez of
Phear</em></span> even
has sound? Simply press S to toggle sound on and off.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f4.large.jpg"><img src="9901f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Cavez
of Phear</em></span> awaits you. Collect the diamonds and watch your head.
</p></div></div><p>
The final item on tonight's menu is a bit of an overkill when it
comes to ASCII games. Featuring client/server network play, complex,
fast-paced 16-color animation, multiple weapons, exploding
characters and gushing blood, the aptly named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span>
takes ASCII games to their sane limit. Written by Karel Kulhavy,
Petr Kulhavy and others, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span> promises that
&ldquo;you'll learn
what a horror man can see in ASCII&rdquo;. You'll find
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span> at
<a href="http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~brain/0verkill" target="_self">artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~brain/0verkill</a>. Of the
games mentioned here, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span> is the one game you
might find in your
distribution's repositories. If you are using Ubuntu Linux, for instance,
you can install it with apt or Synaptic. The site also provides binaries,
if you don't want to compile the program.
</p><p>
Because this is a client/server game, you need to start by running the
<tt  >server</tt> program. In the packaged version, the
program is actually
called <tt  >overkill-server</tt>. Now, open up another
terminal window
and run the client, a program called <tt  >0verkill</tt>
(<tt  >overkill</tt>
in the package). The startup screen scrolls some interesting statements
at the bottom and gives you a hint of what you can expect
(Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f5.large.jpg"><img src="9901f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span>&mdash;think of it as
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> meets ASCII.
</p></div></div><p>
All you need now to start the game is to connect to a running server,
press S, then enter the hostname or IP address.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span> comes
with both male and female characters. Those characters, in turn, can be
customized by giving them a unique color scheme. To change the color,
press the up or down arrow while at the connect screen. To change from
male to female, cycle through the 16 colors. Once you have selected
a character, press the N key to give it a name.
</p><p>
Everything is controlled via keystrokes. Press the left and right
arrow keys to move left and right. Press the up key to jump or climb. As
you work your way through the various levels, you'll collect weapons
and ammunition; to use a different weapon, press the 1, 2, 3, 4
or 5 keys. If and when you get killed, an event that occurs in truly
gruesome, blood-curdling ASCII, you can respawn your character by
pressing the spacebar. If you get stuck, press H for a handy
help menu. You can still have fun playing on your own, but to
get your heart really pumping, invite a friend (or two or three) to
connect for
great multiplayer action (Figure 6). The game even remembers
what has come before, as you'll notice when the corpses start to pile up
(shudder). It's great, heart-thumping and fast network fun.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9901f6.large.jpg"><img src="9901f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You have
no friends here. It's kill or be killed in a game of
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Overkill</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
Speaking of fast, is it possible that time has gone by so
quickly? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> It is nearly closing time.
Perhaps we can
convince Fran&ccedil;ois to refill your glasses a final time, which will
give you just enough time for another ASCII deathmatch, with or without
aliens, before you go. Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
and let us
all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
