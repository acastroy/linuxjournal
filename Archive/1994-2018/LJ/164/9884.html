Last month, I described a growing trend in the world of Web/database
development. No longer are developers content to create interesting
new applications for people to consume. Rather, more and more
companies are looking to create service-based platforms, upon which
other developers can create new and interesting applications. 
</p><p>
For example, many of us think of eBay as a Web site that handles
on-line auctions. And it's true; at the end of the day, what pays the
bills at eBay is the fact that many people are buying and selling
things. But eBay has been especially successful because it offers not
a particular application, but rather an infrastructure upon which
buyers and sellers can create their own applications. Many of those
applications might be invisible to the average user, but they exist
nonetheless. There already are many software packages that help
vendors price, track and sell their wares, and there are similar
packages designed for buyers. 
</p><p>
It's pretty easy to differentiate between an application and a
platform. The former might have a great deal of functionality, but
changes and additions all come from a central group of developers. By
contrast, a platform includes software libraries and/or APIs designed
to make it easy for developers to expand and modify the
core functionality independently. As a platform grows in popularity and developers
make use of the API, a small software ecosystem takes root, making it
harder to compete with the ecosystem, because so many people have a
vested interest in keeping it going.
</p><p>
One of the biggest platform successes of the last few years is
Facebook. Facebook originally was meant to be a small,
Web-based version of the book that newcomers to Harvard (and MIT, for
that matter) are given when they first arrive. Facebook quickly took
off, offering a growing amount of functionality, and expanded to students
at other universities. Facebook then invited everyone&mdash;students and
nonstudents alike&mdash;to become members. Then, in mid-2007, the
Facebook team unveiled F8, the Facebook development platform and API.
Now there are tens of thousands of Facebook developers, and although many
of them are creating trivial or silly applications, some are creating
interesting and profitable ones. Moreover, many people now prefer
Facebook to rivals, such as LinkedIn, partly because their friends are
on Facebook, but also because there is a large library of Facebook
applications they can install and use.
</p><p>
To Web developers, of course, Facebook provides not only a library of
applications that we can use, but also an infrastructure on which we can
create our own applications. This month, let's dip our toes in the
waters of Facebook application development, create our own simple
application and see how it can hook into Facebook.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ce580.0x29c66b8"></a>
A Souped-Up Proxy</h2></div></div><p>
If you have been developing Web applications for a while, you
might wonder how it is that Facebook allows people to add their own
code to a running Web site. Do you upload your code to a virtual
server? Do you run it through a Web service? Do you write it using a
macro language within the Facebook system?
</p><p>
The answer turns out to be simpler than any of these possibilities.
You run your Web application on your own server, write it in
whatever programming language you choose and include whatever
functionality you want. When someone invokes your application via
Facebook, the Facebook server then makes a request to your Web
application. The output from your application is passed along to
Facebook, which then integrates it into the page and finally sends the
output to the user's browser. In other words, you can think of
Facebook as a proxy HTTP server, one that you can configure to allow
people to visit your site.
</p><p>
But, of course, things are a bit more complicated than that. When it is
invoked by a user, your Web application has access to information
about that user and about that user's Facebook friends and networks.
Thus, it's possible that Facebook will invoke your application on
behalf of a user&mdash;and that before it returns any output, your
application will send a number of queries to Facebook to learn
more about the current user. This back and forth is surprisingly
fast, at least on the Facebook end, but it does mean you need
to think about what information you really want to request from
Facebook, if you want to ensure that your application runs at top
speed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ce580.0x29c68c8"></a>
Setting Things Up</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in creating a Facebook application is to add the
Developer application by going to <a href="http://facebook.com/developers" target="_self">facebook.com/developers</a> . (When you create your own application,
people then will have to add it in a similar way.)
</p><p>
You will be asked if you want to add the Developer application.
Every application on Facebook has a unique name; I suspect that over
time, people will hoard application names, just as they have done with
domain names. Notice that you need to agree to add an
application explicitly, and that Facebook provides you with a number of options
to protect your privacy. So, you can allow (or forbid) the
application to access information about you, to put a link in your
navigation list or even to publish stories in the &ldquo;feed&rdquo; on your home
page. This last item is particularly important; when checked, it
allows applications to write to your personal feed, which then
is picked up and displayed on your friends' home pages.
</p><p>
Once you have added the Developer application, you now can create your
own applications. Note that only those Facebook users who want to
create new applications need to add the Developer application; if you
only want to use applications, there isn't really any need for
it.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to create a new application. If you have just added
Developer, you will be presented with a link asking if you want
to create your first application. If you already have added
Developer, go to the Developer home page
(<a href="http://facebook.com/developers" target="_self">facebook.com/developers</a>) and click on see my apps. In
either case, you'll be given a chance to create a new application.
Each developer can create almost any number of applications, and it is
free of charge&mdash;so don't think that you need to skimp on the number
of applications you create.
</p><p>
To create an application, click on the link that says &ldquo;create
one&rdquo;, or
if you already have an application, click &ldquo;apply for another key&rdquo;. The
simplest possible application has nothing more than a unique name.
But, in general, you should fill in a number of the optional fields
associated with an application. Thus, although you could create an
application by entering its name and checking the &ldquo;I have read the
terms&rdquo; box, you probably want more. So, click the optional
fields link, and enter the following information:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The support e-mail address should be yours, at least for the
time being.
</p></li><li><p>
The &ldquo;callback URL&rdquo; should be a URL on your server that is
connected to a Web application framework. In our case,
we're going to use a development system for Ruby on Rails
for our server application. Thus, the callback URL will be
http://atf.lerner.co.il:3000/hello/facebook.
</p></li><li><p>
The &ldquo;canvas page URL&rdquo; should be where you enter the
application's unique name again. I used rmlljatf for
mine, because this is my Facebook application for my column
(At the Forge) in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. You will need to choose a
different name.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can ignore a number of the settings, such as whether you should use
FBML (the Facebook Markup Language, a superset of HTML) or iframes,
and whether you want a Web or desktop application (in this case, we want the
former). 
</p><p>
We <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want people to be able to add our application on Facebook.
However, we don't want the new application to be displayed in our
feed, and we also want to restrict the application to developers who
are working on it. So, although we will click the yes check box
that allows people to add the application, we also
should click the developer mode check box farther down and the private
installation check box below that.
</p><p>
When you finish filling out this form, press Submit. If the form
contains no errors, you will be told that your application was
created successfully. Moreover, your new application now will be on
your developer page. Among other things, your application has an API
key and a secret. These are 32-character strings that Facebook
uses to ensure that your application and the Facebook server are
allowed to communicate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ce580.0x29c7210"></a>
The Web Application</h2></div></div><p>
Facebook now is ready to communicate with our Web application&mdash;we had
better create one! As I mentioned previously, I'm using Ruby on Rails
to create a simple Web application that speaks with Facebook.
</p><p>
Now, I could do all the hard work myself. I could read the Facebook
documentation, learn the APIs and debug things. Or, I could benefit
from some amazing work that others have done, and think about my
application, rather than communicate with Facebook. 
</p><p>
If you are using Ruby on Rails, you can do this by installing a
Ruby gem (that is, a prepackaged bundle of code and documentation):

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install rfacebook
</pre>
</p><p>
The rfacebook gem includes everything you need to speak with the
Facebook server from an application. But, it doesn't include some of
the glue that a Rails application needs. For that, you need to
install a Rails plugin. So first, let's create our Rails application,
specifying PostgreSQL as our database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails -d postgresql rmlljatf
</pre>
</p><p>
After Rails creates all the files it needs, we now can install
the rfacebook_on_rails plugin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cd rmlljatf
script/plugin install 
svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rfacebook/plugins/rfacebook_on_rails
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that in order for this to work, you need to have a
Subversion client (svn-client) installed. You also will discover, as
I did, that if you don't have the Ruby SSL libraries installed,
RFacebook will fail mysteriously. On an Ubuntu machine, such as I'm
running, I installed that by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
</pre>
</p><p>
With all these things in place, we now can use the plugin to 
configure Facebook for our system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake facebook:setup
</pre>
</p><p>
Among other things, this creates a configuration file for our Facebook
application in config/facebook.yml. As a very explicit note
indicates during the execution of rake facebook:setup, we need to
open and edit this file in order for things to work. When you open
it, you'll see that you need to enter your API key and secret (from
the Facebook Developer page on the Web). Where it says yourAppName
next to canvas_path, enter your application name. In my case, it's
rmlljatf. And, where it says callback_path, replace it with the
URL you expect to use for the Facebook application on your server. In
my case, that's just /hello/facebook. (This should be a
relative URL.)
</p><p>
Let's create a controller for our application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate controller hello
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, remove the file public/index.rhtml.
</p><p>
Finally, create a simple method in our hello controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def index
  render :text =&gt; "hello"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, when I point my browser to
http://atf.lerner.co.il:3000/hello
the controller (hello) is invoked, as is the default action for that
controller (index). And, I see &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in plain text in my browser.
Yay!
</p><p>
Let's write a tiny bit more code to get things ready. First,
let's define a new method in our hello controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def facebook
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we haven't defined anything in the method, other than that
it exists. Next, we create a facebook.rhtml file in
app/views/hello:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;Hello, FacebookWorld!&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
We can see the results at
http://atf.lerner.co.il:3000/hello/facebook, which
displays:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, FacebookWorld!
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ce580.0x29c7c08"></a>
Hello, FacebookWorld</h2></div></div><p>
Experienced coders know that looking through log files is a great way
to keep track of what is happening. Rails includes a log file for each
environment, giving you separate logs for the development and
production environments, in case they're installed in the same
directory on the same computer.
</p><p>
If I look at the development log (logs/development.log) after my
invocation of the index method, I see the following at the bottom:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Processing HelloController#index (for 84.110.255.110 at 2007-09-12 
08:26:08) [GET]
  Session ID: ef0e25ea44f91f3c900f54c4bca93506
  Parameters: {"action"=&gt;"index", "controller"=&gt;"hello"}
Completed in 0.00339 (295 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.00016 (4%) | 200 OK
[http://atf.lerner.co.il/]
</pre>
</p><p>
None of that should surprise us, and it even should make us happy.
But, if I look right above that, I see some log file messages that are
coming from the RFacebook plugin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
** RFACEBOOK INFO: It looks like you don't have memcache-client,
   so MemCacheStore was not extended
** RFACEBOOK INFO: using default Rails sessions (since we didn't
   find an fb_sig_session_key in the environment)
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks like even without explicitly asking for RFacebook to do
anything, it already has started to look around and act. The first
message has to do with memcached; although it might be useful for certain
distributed applications, we don't need it for right now. The second
note indicates that our method was invoked directly, rather than via
Facebook, so there wasn't any Facebook session information to
retrieve. As a result, we'll use regular Rails sessions, rather than
Facebook sessions.
</p><p>
How can we invoke our application via Facebook? The first thing 
to do is add the application. Go to the developer page
(<a href="http://facebook.com/developers" target="_self">facebook.com/developers</a>), and click on the name of the
application (rmlljatf). On the right side of the page, there should be a
big blue button marked Add application. Click that button, click
the similar button on the next page, and the rmlljatf application
will be installed.
</p><p>
Now, I can point my browser to
http://apps.facebook.com/rmlljatf,
and what do I see? Yes, you guessed it&mdash;a cute little message,
saying:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, FacebookWorld!
</pre>
</p><p>
We managed to point our browser to Facebook, which invoked the
application on our server, which returned results that were then
displayed inside of the Facebook page. Not bad, right?

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we saw how we can basically connect a Web application on
our server with Facebook, displaying the output inside a Facebook
page. Next month, we'll look at how our Web application can access
information from Facebook, interacting with the Facebook database in a
number of different ways.
