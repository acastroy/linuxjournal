Use bc as a
quick-and-dirty command-line utility.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c4580.0x25bc450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One thing that's always bothered me about Linux, and UNIX before it, is
that there isn't a decent command-line calculator available. You know,
something where you can type in <tt  >solve 5+8</tt> or,
better, <tt  >solve 33/5</tt> and get the solution.
</p><p>
There's expr, but that's barely useful at all, and I've always been
baffled that it's constrained to integer math to this day. No one has ever
extended its functionality beyond the most rudimentary capabilities
for shell script programming.
</p><p>
There's bc, which has the power we seek, but it has to be one of the
most bizarre interfaces of any program in the Linux panoply, and there's
nothing more frustrating than accidentally falling into bc and being
unable to get out!
</p><p>
The third choice is dc, the so-called desktop calculator (really,
that's what dc stands for), but that too is fundamentally flawed
because it uses RPN (reverse Polish notation&mdash;really, it's named after Polish
mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz). Not sure what that is? Well, here's a
demonstration of how it doesn't work:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dc 1+1
Could not open file 1+1: No such file or directory
$ dc -e 1+1
dc: stack empty
$ dc -e 1 + 1
Could not open file +: No such file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
With this kind of burnout on a rudimentary math task, do you really care
about learning an entirely new notation to figure out that 1+1=3? No,
2?
</p><p>
Of these three choices, none suffice, but bc does show promise because
it can handle floating-point numbers and has the ability to specify how
much post-decimal-point precision you seek. Learn its obscure notation,
and you can calculate 1+1:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bc
bc 1.06

1+1
2
quit
$  	
</pre>
</p><p>
The challenge with bc is to revamp how you interact with it&mdash;to put a
wrapper program &ldquo;in front&rdquo; of the utility so that you can use it as a
quick-and-dirty command-line utility.
</p><p>
There are two problems with using it that way as designed, as you can
see here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bc 1+1
File 1+1 is unavailable.
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c4580.0x25bcb30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bc -q
3/2
1
quit
$
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c4580.0x25bcc90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(The -q option gets rid of the FSF intro header.)
</p><p>
By default, bc offers up integer results only, so although you and I know
that 3/2 = 1.5, bc shows it as 1, which makes it pretty darn useless
for any precision calculations.
</p><p>
However, unlike the other calculation alternatives, bc does have the
ability to be a bit more precise. The key is that you have to specify
the scale, the number of digits after the decimal point that you want
to see. Add that, and things change:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bc -q
11/7
1
scale=8
11/7
1.57142857
quit
$
</pre>
</p><p>
The challenge for us is to figure out a way to write a shell
script wrapper that allows us not only to do simple calculations from
the command line, but also have them solved as floating-point calculations.
The goal is to be able to type something like <tt  >solve
11/7</tt>, and have it
display 1.57142857.

Of Wrappers and Rappers</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, given my headline, I have an urge to write in some sort
of rhyming slang, but I know my editor won't let me get away with it,
so you're safe. Nonetheless, wrappers are an important concept and a
big part of why Linux is so darn powerful as an operating system.
</p><p>
In many ways, UNIX and Linux supply all the tools you need, the
rudimentary building blocks, and one of the purposes of shell script
programming is to add the veneer, the pleasantry of a usable user
interface. That's exactly what we're doing with our solve script if
you think about it. Actually, doing mathematics in a shell script would
be pretty tricky, but we certainly can transform a simple query into the
more complicated sequence of commands needed to get bc to output what
we desire.
</p><p>
The challenge though is that we're not simply adding a command flag or
turning an express around; we need to capture the requested formula and
inject it into a sequence of commands that we're feeding the underlying
Linux utility via standard input (stdin).
</p><p>
I do this by using what's called a here document, as denoted with the
notation &lt;&lt; in a script. Recall that a notation like <tt  >wc
&lt;
letter.txt</tt>
invokes the wc command and uses the contents of letter.txt as stdin
for the command. The result is the number of characters, words and lines
in the file, as if I'd actually typed in the file, letter by letter.
</p><p>
The &lt;&lt; notation is a convenient way to have a similar remapping of
standard input for the invoked command, but based on the material that's
actually present in the command sequence, not a separate file.
</p><p>
As a result, the character sequence immediately following the &lt;&lt; symbol
is the end marker, not the filename. It works like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat &lt;&lt; EndOfInput
This is a sample of the kind of 
trick you can do with a here document. 
Why is this cool?  Because you can also 
expand variables ($PATH) 
and do other spiffo shell script 
hijinks.
EndOfInput

</pre>
</p><p>
Run this little script snippet (as a script), and you'll see the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh samplepscript.sh
This is a sample of the kind of 
trick you can do with a here document. 
Why is this cool?  Because you can also 
expand variables (/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin) 
and do other spiffo shell script 
hijinks.
</pre>
</p><p>
In our case, this also means you can move a command-line argument
into the middle of a sequence of commands being sent to a core Linux
command like bc. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

bc &lt;&lt; EOF
scale=4
$@
quit
EOF

</pre>
</p><p>
Believe it or not, that's the rudimentary solution to our challenge of
writing a floating-point-capable command-line calculator. Check it out:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh solve.sh 1+1
2
$ sh solve.sh 11/7
1.5714
</pre>
</p><p>
Next month, we'll dig into useful refinements and make it a full-blown
addition to our Linux toolkit. See you then!
