Use Emacs to create a flexible plain-text organizer and
personal productivity system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It is said that Emacs, that versatile toolbox for working with text,
is more than merely a text editor&mdash;it's a lifestyle. That's not just
hyperbole. In this article, I show you how to turn Emacs into
a flexible personal organizer and productivity system.
</p><p>
I started using Emacs for programming but soon discovered that it worked
well for nonprogramming writing tasks too. I began experimenting
with several modes that extend Emacs for writing notes and planning
projects. Though each one was useful in its own way, none of these
features or modes fit my style of working. Then I discovered Org-mode.
</p><p>
Org-mode is a new Emacs mode developed by Carsten Dominik. It
is designed for taking notes, outlining, writing, project planning,
maintaining to-do lists, time management and even publishing to
Web sites&mdash;all this using only Emacs and plain text.
</p><p>
Plain text? Why would anyone want to use plain text for doing all of the
above? Plain text offers several advantages. You are not locked in to a
file format or an operating system. You can edit plain-text files using
any available text editor. It is easy to copy and paste plain text from
and into e-mail messages. You can track changes in your document using a version
control system, such as CVS or Subversion. When I am writing, I find that
plain text offers one more advantage&mdash;it enables me to think better
and focus on my ideas, without the distractions of a word processor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159c608"></a>
Getting Started with Org-mode</h2></div></div><p>
For this article, I assume that you have Emacs installed and have some
familiarity with using it. If you are not already an Emacs user, maybe
Org-mode will give you a good reason to start using it. (See
Resources for information on getting started with Emacs.)
</p><p>
Org-mode is included in GNU Emacs 22. You also can install Org-mode to
work with GNU Emacs 21 and XEmacs. I used GNU Emacs 22 and Org-mode 4.42
to write this article. If you already have Emacs on your system, check
whether Org-mode is available by typing the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
M-x org-mode
</pre>
</p><p>
The above notation means press the meta key (Esc or Alt, depending on
your setup) followed by x, followed by <tt  >org-mode</tt>, and then press the
Return (or Enter) key.
</p><p>
If Emacs displays &ldquo;No Match&rdquo;, it means you do not have Org-mode
installed. You will need to install org-mode manually or
install GNU Emacs 22. You can find precompiled binaries of GNU Emacs 22
for your Linux distribution and even for other operating systems. On
Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), you can install GNU Emacs 22 (with Org-mode
4.56d) by running the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
</pre>
</p><p>
If you need to install Org-mode for GNU Emacs 21 or XEmacs, download
the latest version from <a href="http://orgmode.org" target="_self">orgmode.org</a>, and look for the manual
that provides detailed installation instructions. (The Org-mode
documentation includes an excellent manual with more than 100 pages and
a handy reference card.) Once you have org-mode installed, run the
<tt  >M-x org-mode</tt> command again. If Org-mode is installed correctly, Emacs
will display &ldquo;(Org)&rdquo; in its mode line area, and Org-mode will
be active.
If you are running Emacs in a graphical environment, you also should see
the Org pull-down menu (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9116f1.large.jpg"><img src="9116f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Graphical User Interface Menu for Org-mode
</p></div></div><p>
Although Org-mode provides a graphical menu, in this article I refer
to Org-mode keyboard commands only. Once you get familiar with Org-mode
keystrokes, you will find them to be more efficient than the graphical menu.
</p><p>
Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file and restart Emacs:


<pre     class="programlisting">
;; Org-mode settings
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org$" . org-mode))
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-font-lock-mode 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you save your org files with the .org extension, they will
open up using Org-mode in Emacs. I recommend creating a directory to
keep all your Org files. I use ~/notes. Although you can invoke org-mode
for any text file, it's convenient to have them in one directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159cdf0"></a>
Outlining and Writing</h2></div></div><p>
Outlining is an effective technique for organizing thoughts, taking notes
or writing articles. Emacs has a built-in outline-mode that stores
text as entries. Each entry has a headline and a body. Entries can
be nested to create a tree of hierarchical information. Emacs uses
asterisks (stars) to denote the hierarchy of an outline tree. Lines that
do not begin with a star are considered to be the body of the headline
above it. In the following example, <tt  >** Apples</tt> is a
headline. <tt  >Apples
are red</tt> is the body for the Apples headline.

<pre     class="programlisting">
* Fruit 
** Apples 
Apples are red 
** Oranges 
Oranges are orange 
*Vegetables
</pre>
</p><p>
Branches of a tree can be folded and hidden from view to make it easier
to navigate the tree and work on specific parts of the tree. When a
headline is folded, its body and subtree (all branches) are hidden from
view, and the headline is displayed ending with ellipses (three dots).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159d0b0"></a>
Outline Structure</h2></div></div><p>
Org-mode is based on Emacs' outlinemode, but it makes working with
outlines much easier. Place the cursor on a headline. Using the Tab
key, you can expand the headline to show its branches and body. Using Shift-Tab
does the same for the entire document (Figures 2&ndash;4).

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Outline Overview
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Outline Partially Expanded
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Outline Fully Expanded
</p></div></div><p>
Org-mode provides useful keystrokes for modifying the outline
structure. To promote a heading by one level, place the cursor on the
heading,
and use the keystroke M-left (meta and left arrow keys together). To demote
a heading by one level use M-right. You can promote an entire subtree
with M-Shift-left (Meta, Shift and left arrow keys together) and demote it with
M-Shift-right.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159d7e8"></a>
Plain Lists</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes you may need to add a plain list within the body of a
subtree that is not part of the tree structure of the document. To add
an unordered plain list, start the line with <tt  >-</tt> or
<tt  >+</tt>. To make Org-mode
add a - or + at the start of subsequent list items automatically,
use M-Return to insert the next list item. To add an ordered list, start
the line with <tt  >1.</tt>, and to make Org-mode number subsequent
items automatically, use M-Return to insert the next list item. Add an item in the
middle of an ordered list, and Org-mode automatically renumbers
the list items. You can mix ordered and unordered lists too. Want
to add check boxes to a plain list? Start the list item with <tt  >-[
]</tt>. You can
toggle the check box using C-c C-c, which 
displays the check box as <tt  >[X]</tt> (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Plain Lists
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x159dc60"></a>
Hyperlinks</h2></div></div><p>
Org-mode recognizes URLs and turns them into clickable links. If Emacs
knows your default Web browser, clicking on URLs in Org-mode opens
up the link in your default Web browser. Org-mode supports other types
of external links, including links to files and images (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1996170"></a>
Tables</h2></div></div><p>
Org-mode includes a table editor that makes it possible to format
tables in plain ASCII text. Using | as a column separator, Org-mode
automatically reformats the plain-text table to realign columns or
add new rows. Use Tab to move to the next cell and Shift-Tab to move to the
previous cell. Org-mode helpfully right-aligns numbers. You can do spreadsheet calculations in these plain-text tables by inserting
formulae within cells (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Plain-Text Tables
</p></div></div><p>
These are just a few examples of how Org-mode makes it easy to
write and format in plain text. But Org-mode's most impressive features are those
that enable you to organize and track tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1996488"></a>
Tags</h2></div></div><p>
You can assign tags to any headline. Tags are simply letters or
numbers preceded and followed by a colon. For example,
<tt  >:RED:</tt> could
be a tag. You can associate multiple tags with a single headline as in
<tt  >:RED:GREEN:</tt>. Tags are added to the end of a headline. To add a tag to a
headline, place the cursor on the headline and type <tt  >C-c
C-c</tt>. Org-mode
will prompt you for a tag.
</p><p>
Org-mode creates a dynamic list of all tags in the file. If you already
have tags in a file and want to tag a headline, Org-mode presents a list
of already-entered tags. After typing <tt  >C-c C-c</tt> on a headline, use the up and
down arrow keys to see other tags in use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Tags
</p></div></div><p>
Tags can be used to set up a system of labels to relate and group
information spread out across an Org file. You could use tags to mark
the activity type, such as <tt  >:CODE:</tt> and
<tt  >:CALL:</tt>. If you are coordinating
tasks with others, you could use colleagues' names as tags.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1996a08"></a>
Work Flow and To-Do Lists</h2></div></div><p>
In Org-mode you can create a to-do list in the same file that you
are using to write notes or outline a project. This has the advantage
of placing the task in the context of the entire project. To mark
a headline as a to-do item, start the headline with the word
<tt  >TODO</tt>. You can do this more quickly by
placing the cursor on the headline and typing in
<tt  >C-c C-t</tt>. This adds the label
<tt  >TODO</tt> to the start of the headline for
you. The same command can be used to toggle the
<tt  >TODO</tt> to <tt  >DONE</tt> when you
complete the task. Use the command once again, and Org-mode removes
<tt  >DONE</tt> from the headline.
</p><p>
<tt  >TODO</tt> and <tt  >DONE</tt> are the
standard work-flow states in Org-mode, but it's
possible to configure your own work flow, either globally for all Org-mode
files or a custom one for each file. For example, if you wanted to set up
a custom work flow, such as <tt  >TODO --&gt; TEST --&gt; DONE</tt>, add the following to
the top of your Org file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO TEST DONE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1996ed8"></a>
Priorities</h2></div></div><p>
Once you create tasks, you will need to prioritize them. Org-mode supports
three priority levels: A, B and C. A is the highest priority. Priority
for a task can be set by adding <tt  >[#A]</tt> to a
headline. The command <tt  >C-c</tt> also can be used to set
priorities. Figure 9 shows an example of a task list
using tags, a custom to-do work flow and priorities.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Tags, Custom To-Do Work Flow and Priorities
</p></div></div><p>
Tags, custom work flows and priorities, make Org-mode flexible enough
for many different uses. It's easy to develop a custom organization
system that suits a project. Each Org file can use a different system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x19972a0"></a>
Timestamps</h2></div></div><p>
To associate an event or a meeting with a date in Org-mode, use a plain
timestamp. You can insert a plain timestamp in headlines or the body of an
entry with <tt  >C-c</tt>. You also can specify date ranges. Org-mode provides
special timestamps useful for scheduling and tracking tasks. To set a
reminder to start working on an entry on a certain date, precede the
timestamp with the label <tt  >SCHEDULED</tt>. If an entry is to be completed by
a certain date, precede the timestamp with the label
<tt  >DEADLINE</tt>. You also can
use Org-mode for tracking time spent on each task. This is done by
using the <tt  >CLOCK</tt> label preceding the timestamp. Org-mode has keyboard commands
to make it easy to insert timestamps and timestamp labels.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1997508"></a>
Example</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 10 shows a fictional example that illustrates some of Org-mode's planning
and scheduling features. This Org file uses a custom to-do
work flow, which is specified at the top of the file. Task are marked with
work-flow states. Major project phases are outlined some with scheduled
or deadline dates. Tags are used for marking activity type and team
member responsibilities. Dates and times are marked for meetings. A
clock timestamp is used to track time spent on a meeting. The &ldquo;On-site
Meetings&rdquo; entry uses a date range because it spans multiple days. High
and low priority markers help prioritize tasks. Folded away from view
are the project proposal, meeting minutes, reports and a budget
spreadsheet. Everything related to a project can be kept in one file.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Tag Searches</h2></div></div><p>
Since Org files can get large, Org-mode provides mechanisms to generate
different views of an Org file showing only the information you are
interested in. In Figure 10, if you want to search for all entries
with the tag <tt  >PAT</tt>, use the command <tt  >C-c
\</tt> and type in <tt  >PAT</tt> (Figure 11).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a4580.0x1997be8"></a>
Agenda Views</h2></div></div><p>
Org-mode's Agenda feature offers other views, such as a list of all to-do items
or an agenda-like display of entries and their dates. First, you need to
add your Org file to your Org agenda by using the command <tt  >C-c
[</tt>. Then,
type <tt  >C-c a</tt> to be presented with options for different views. For
example, to see a to-do list of the fictional project shown in Figure 10,
type <tt  >C-c a t</tt> (Figure 12). You also can generate views
based on tags (Figure 13).

Exporting and Publishing</h2></div></div><p>
Org-mode files are readable, and you can copy and paste the text directly
from the Org file into e-mail messages or other documents. You also can export from
Org-mode to other file formats. To export an Org file to a formatted
ASCII text file with a contents page and automatically numbered
headings, use the command <tt  >M-x org-export-as-ascii</tt>. Org-mode generates
a file with the same name as the Org file, but with a .txt extension. To
export as HTML, use the command <tt  >M-x
org-export-as-html</tt>, and Org-mode
creates a file with a .html extension. The HTML version will have
a hyperlinked contents page, numbered headings, formatted tables,
hyperlinks and images, if any (Figure 14).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9116f14.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I have covered only some of the features Org-mode offers using a single
Org file as an example, but there is more to Org-mode. You can maintain
multiple Org files and generate agenda views or to-do lists across Org
files. Entries can be archived. Org-mode also includes a publishing system
to generate a set of interlinked HTML files automatically and upload
them to a server. Much of Org-mode's behavior can be customized. Org-mode
builds on top of Emacs' core features. It also provides hooks to interact
with other Emacs modes and packages. It also can be used to implement
David Allen's &ldquo;Getting Things
Done&rdquo; method for personal productivity (see Resources). I find Org-mode
invaluable for taking notes, planning projects, tracking tasks and
organizing ideas.
</p><p>
Using only plain-text for writing, organizing, planning, and scheduling
may appear to be a quixotic goal. Org-mode meets the challenge and
delivers a practical, intuitive, and elegant solution.
