More shell script programming building blocks, and finally, our first
small script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1097580.0x118f3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month we started out easy, with a discussion of file
redirection. This month I continue to talk about the basic building
blocks of shell script programming by exploring pipes, then we jump
into some basic programming statements so we can move into an interesting
programming project.
</p><p>
Many people who start working with the Linux command line don't realize
that it is unlike the world of the graphical interface, where programs are
all standalone entities that can't really interact with each other
(that is to say, Photoshop can't feed output directly to Microsoft Word,
if you're a Windows person, or in Linux terms, The GIMP can't easily
interact with OpenOffice.org). We've been taught to think of programs as
autonomous, but when you're on the Linux command line, programs can all
communicate with each other.
</p><p>
This is a real boon, because it means that instead of having roughly
1,800 different commands available, you actually have the equivalent of
millions of different commands that can be put together to do just about
anything you can imagine.
</p><p>
The key is the | (pipe) symbol, which hooks the output of the first command
to the input of the second. For example, want to know how many files
you have in your home directory? The simple solution is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls | wc -l
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1097580.0x118f660"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which is invoking the ls command to list files, but instead of displaying
the output on the screen, it's actually fed to the wc (word count)
program, with the -l option indicating that we want to have a count of
the number of lines in the input stream, rather than the number of words
or characters.
</p><p>
Now, here's something a bit more complex. Let's say that you want to know how
many files you have that were last modified in August. When you use the
<tt  >ls -l</tt> command, you notice that the lines are typified by the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxr-xr-x    11 taylor  taylor    374 Aug  16 21:57 ConnectSafely
</pre>
</p><p>
This provides lots of information, but all we care about is that the month of last
modification is shown as a three-letter abbreviation surrounded by
spaces. The grep command makes it easy to match only specific patterns in
the input stream, so now let's build a three-part pipeline that lists all
files in the current directory, screens out everything that isn't from
Aug, and then counts how many lines remain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | grep " Aug " | wc -l
</pre>
</p><p>
See how that works? You should be thinking that people with even a
rudimentary grasp of the standard 20 or 30 Linux commands has
a powerful interactive environment at their beck and call. You'd be right!
(Note that if you don't have files that are old enough, you won't see the
month name in the <tt  >ls -l</tt> output. Move to an older
directory, like /etc, and try the command again; odds are you'll find
sufficient old files in that directory instead.)
</p><p>
You can even have a pipeline that has its final output saved to a file
by simply adding a redirect to the end of the pipeline:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | grep " Aug " &gt; files.from.August
</pre>
</p><p>
And, with the use of the little-known tee command, you can even save a
copy of the data stream in the middle of a pipeline too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | grep " Aug " | tee aug.output | wc -l
</pre>
</p><p>
Here we have the same output as earlier, but now a copy of the intermediate results are
neatly tucked away in the aug.output file. (A helpful tip too: you can
use <tt  >tee /dev/tty</tt> and have a copy of intermediate
output shown on screen,
even though it's also being fed to the next step in the pipeline.)
</p><p>
Thousands of Linux commands are accessible from the command line,
and all but a small percentage are easily added to a command pipe. Given
that a typical command also has at least a half-dozen different options
to change its behavior, you can get a sense for just how rich the
command-line environment is and why so many Linux power users and
administrators still eschew the GUI for most of their work.

Flow Control and the Test Command</h2></div></div><p>
The next building block with shell scripting is flow control. This is
an essential ingredient of any programming language, from the obscure
APL to the now-pedestrian BASIC. Fortunately, there are a number of flow control
elements available for shell script programmers, ranging from
the most rudimentary if-then-else-fi to the more sophisticated while-do-end
and repeat-until blocks and switch-case-end.
</p><p>
To look at flow control, it's necessary that we detour for a few minutes
and talk about one of the most important commands for shell script
programmers: test. The test command often is the program that evaluates
conditional statements and ascertains whether the result is TRUE or FALSE,
obviously a key capability for any sort of conditional flow control.
</p><p>
Believe it or not, the test command is linked to the [ command,
which is why you can write conditional statements one of two ways,
as exemplified here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if test -f filename
if [ -f filename ]
</pre>
</p><p>
This particular conditional tests to see if filename is indeed a file
(the -f test). If you use the more readable [ notation,
you are required to include the closing ] symbol too; whereas, if you
use test overtly, you can skip any closing symbol on a conditional.
</p><p>
Tip: using the [ symbol has a second benefit. Many modern shells have
a version of the test command built in to the shell itself, considerably
speeding up shell script execution. Using the [ symbol ensures you'll
use the built-in version if available, but explicitly calling test means
that you'll likely not have that performance enhancement when running
your scripts.
</p><p>
The test command has at least 30 different options, and it's critical
that you become familiar with them, so you can understand how to test two
alphanumeric strings (for example, filenames) versus how you might test
numeric values (file sizes) or even perform a bewildering set of file
and directory tests, including tests for execute permission, nonzero
size, whether it's a pipe or socket and many more possibilities. To begin learning more
about this command, type <tt  >man test</tt> in your terminal.
</p><p>
Armed with the test command, a standard if-then conditional is structured
as shown:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ condition ]
then
        statement block if condition is true
else
        statement block if condition is false
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Oftentimes, you'll see programmers use a small shorthand by adding a
semicolon, so that the first two lines are instead written as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ condition ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's a quick example of how this might be used before I run out of
space in this issue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -w . ] ; then
   echo "I can write to the current directory. "
else
  echo "I cannot write to the current directory. "
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this offers a quick way to test whether you have write
permission to the current directory. Type it in to an editor (vi or
emacs, whatever you prefer) and save it in your home directory as
dir.write.sh, then you can use <tt  >cd</tt> to move to different directories
and run this first shell script by typing <tt  >sh
~/dir.write.sh</tt> to see whether
you have write permission in that directory.
</p><p>
Out of space. Next month, we'll spend more time looking at conditional
statements and flow control and start noodling on how to write a
rudimentary blackjack game as a shell script. See you then!
