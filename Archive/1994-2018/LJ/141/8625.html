Rails provides great tools for managing test data to build and refine an
application. Here's how to use them.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the last few months, we have looked at Ruby on Rails, an
open-source Web application framework written in the Ruby language
meant to make Web/database development particularly easy. We
already have looked at many facets of Rails development&mdash;the
division of applications into model, view and controller components;
subclassing ActiveRecord for automatic object/database mapping; and
the use of Rails validators to ensure the integrity of data stored
in the database.
</p><p>
Since starting to work with Rails several months ago, I have been
impressed with its design and execution. Developing in Rails feels a
bit different and funny at first, but you quickly can get into it,
enjoying the fact that much of the tedium has been taken care of
by ActiveRecord automatically.
</p><p>
Although Rails can reduce the amount of code we must write in our
Web/database applications, it cannot reduce it to zero. And wherever
there is code, there are bound to be bugs. As experienced
Web/database developers know, testing these sorts of applications can
be a bit tricky, because there is a disconnect between what the client
sends and sees, and what actually happens with the server. It's not
unusual, even today, for Web developers to debug their applications
using a combination of print statements and error logs. Indeed,
I am personally guilty of this on many occasions, partly out of habit
and partly because this is often the best way to find problems with
projects.
</p><p>
Managers and programmers alike know that it is cheapest and easiest to
fix bugs as soon as they occur, and at an early stage of a project.
But programmers often are reluctant to test their software, especially
when such testing can be time consuming and tedious.
</p><p>
A relatively simple solution thus has emerged during the past few years,
in which programmers were responsible for not only testing the
software they had worked on, but also for writing the tests that would
check the software in as many places as possible. Such unit testing
can help ensure that each individual part of the system is robust,
allowing us to depend on it when integrated into a full application.
</p><p>
This month, we look at the built-in Rails functionality for
performing unit tests and whet our appetite for writing functional
tests as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a6b8"></a>
Test Database</h2></div></div><p>
Everything we have seen so far might seem reasonable, but there
is a danger lurking beneath the surface. If we actually go ahead and
test all of our code, we are likely to end up adding, modifying and
deleting data in the actual database. On a serious production
system, this could be more than inconvenient, it might cause untold
problems.
</p><p>
If you have been following along since we first began to work with
Rails, you might well remember that we defined three different
databases for each of the projects we have worked with. In the case
of the simple Weblog application we examined the last few
months, we created three databases: blog_development, blog_test and
blog_production. We completely ignored the _test and _development
databases, concentrating solely on the _production version. Now that
we will start testing our application, we will be using the _test
database. Only when we are sure that our database and application
have passed the test suite will we move it over into the production
system.
</p><p>
If you have not already done so, create the test database and load
its definitions. On my system, I created a blog user for
PostgreSQL and executed the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb -U blog blog_test
</pre>
</p><p>
I then loaded the database definitions that I had saved in the blog/db
directory, in a file called create.sql:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -U blog blog_test &lt; blog/db/create.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
This loads the table definitions. Assuming that create.sql was
identical when I did the same with the development database, I can now
assume that the development and test databases are defined in the same
way.
</p><p>
But what if we have not been so good about updating create.sql with
each modification we've made to our development database? Are we then
forced to compare the two database structures manually, update
create.sql and then re-import the definitions?
</p><p>
Luckily, the answer is no. Rails comes with a short program,
clone_structure_to_test, that copies the structure of the development
database to the test database. Note that it copies only the
structure, not the contents. To invoke it, switch to the main
application directory (blog, in our case) and use the rake, or
Ruby make, program, which executes the appropriate section of the
Rakefile in the current directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rake clone_structure_to_test
</pre>
</p><p>
If the blog_test database does not yet exist, or if there are other
issues, you will get an error message. Otherwise, you see only
basic output, as I did:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[reuven@server blog]$ rake clone_structure_to_test
(in
/home/reuven/blog)
</pre>
</p><p>
I encountered some initial problems with clone_structure_to_test, with
the script claiming I was not the owner of the public schema in
PostgreSQL. I got around this by giving the blog database user
superuser permissions, which is necessary for the cloning process to
work correctly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql blog_test

blog_development=# alter user blog createuser;
ALTER USER
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have our test database in place, we can start to write
some tests. But where will we put them? Rails, in its typical style,
already has defined a location for the tests and assumes we will
follow the same convention as the author and other Rails users. This
means looking in the blog/test directory, parallel with the
blog/app and blog/db directories.
</p><p>
The blog/test directory contains four subdirectories and a single
file of Ruby code, all of which are standard in a Rails application.
The four subdirectories are fixtures, functional, mocks and
unit, and refer to different parts of the testing mechanism that we
are expected to create or modify.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290ace8"></a>
Fixtures</h2></div></div><p>
Before we can begin testing, however, we need to overcome a problem:
if we want to test our application, we should first populate the
database tables with data. Moreover, we want it to be the same,
consistent data each time we run our tests, so that we can know what
is being tested. Rails solves this problem with fixtures, which
automatically populate our test database before we want to test.
The directory blog/test/fixtures in our system is where we can
create such fixtures, generally using YAML, yet another markup
language, whose structure is largely determined through indentation.
</p><p>
We create one YAML file for each database table we want to test. Our
database contains only one table, so we have to create only a
single YAML file, blogs.yml. Sure enough, when we look at the
blog/test/fixtures directory, we see that there is already such a
file there, demonstrating how we create our fixtures and pointing us
to documentation at <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html" target="_self">ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html</a>,
in case we don't completely understand how fixtures work.
</p><p>
We now create one or more entries in our blog.yml file, each of
which corresponds to a single row in the Blogs database table,
corresponding in turn to a single instance of the Blog object
defined in our blog/app/models directory. As a reminder, our table
definition is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Blogs (
id           SERIAL   NOT NULL,
title        TEXT     NOT NULL,
contents     TEXT     NOT NULL,
posted_at    TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL  DEFAULT NOW(),

 PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is how we could create two fixtures for this table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
blog_entry_one:
    id:    1
    title:    My first entry!
    contents:  It was a dark and stormy night, and
I forgot my umbrella.  So I decided to tell the world
on my blog.
    posted_at: 2005-Sep-1 22:00:00

blog_entry_two:
    id: 2
    title:    My second entry!
    contents:  It was much nicer this morning.
    posted_at: 2005-Sep-1 22:00:00
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the equivalent of two INSERT statements. Given that INSERT is
standard SQL, why would we prefer to use fixtures?
</p><p>
To begin with, fixtures ensure that we always start with the same
baseline data. It's terribly frustrating to run tests, only to have
them fail because of a uniqueness constraint that was triggered by
duplicate data.
</p><p>
The second reason is that it allows us to test our database objects
not only in the database itself, but also from a source. That is, the
Rails test system loads the data in our YAML file into the database,
and then accesses them via our model objects. It then loads the
values from our YAML file a second time, making them available via a
hash. We can then compare the two, ensuring that data
was imported correctly before we begin to test more sophisticated
methods.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290b108"></a>
Unit Tests</h2></div></div><p>
With our fixture in place, we now can begin to execute the first of
our unit tests. Unit tests check individual methods and objects. If
an application's components pass a complete set of unit tests, there
is still room for error. However, those errors tend to be from
the integration of the units, which are covered by a different set of
tests.
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, unit tests are defined inside of the test/unit
directory within our main application directory. Rails automatically
creates a unit test file for each model class you have defined; thus, my
test/unit directory contains a file named blog_test.rb,
corresponding to the Blog class defined in app/models/blog.rb.
(Remember: Rails model objects have singular names and refer
to database tables that have plural names.)
</p><p>
By default, the file contains a skeleton for our unit tests:

<pre     class="programlisting">

require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../test_helper'

class BlogTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  fixtures :blogs

  def setup
@blog = Blog.find(1)
  end

  # Replace this with your real tests.
  def test_truth
assert_kind_of Blog,  @blog
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
The first line helps to bootstrap the test mechanism and is not of
immediate interest. But then we see that we are defining a class
(called BlogTest, using the Rails naming convention that we would
expect in a file called blog_test.rb). BlogTest is a subclass of
Test::Unit::TestCase, which comes with Rails, and provides us with a
number of different test-related features.
</p><p>
The definition of BlogTest begins with a declaration, fixtures,
whose value is :blogs&mdash;an indication that when Rails wants to test
our Blog object with the BlogTest object, it should first populate the
test database with fixtures defined in test/fixtures/blogs.yml. If we
are interested in using multiple fixtures, we can name them as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fixtures :blogs, :foo, :bar
</pre>
</p><p>
Two methods are defined for us by default, called setup and
test_truth. The setup method, as you might expect from its name,
gets things ready for our tests. In this particular case, it invokes
Blog.find(), giving it a parameter of 1. In other words, it retrieves
the object whose primary key is 1 (that is, blog_entry_one) and puts it
into @blog. Perl programmers might need to remember that in Ruby,
@blog is an instance variable, not necessarily an array. In this
particular case, @blog contains a single instance of Blog&mdash;the
object that Blog.find(1) returned.
</p><p>
The other method, test_truth, then uses one of the predefined test
assertions that comes with Rails. In this particular case, we use the
assert_kind_of assertion to check that @blog is an instance of Blog.
</p><p>
To run this initial version of our tests, we simply say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ruby blog_test.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
As the tests run, we get a status report. If all goes well, the
output should look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[reuven@server unit]$ ruby blog_test.rb
Loaded suite blog_test
Started
.
Finished in 19.066227 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre>
</p><p>
The first few times that I ran these tests, I received error messages.
The first problem was that I had failed to change blogs.yml from its
original, default state, without defining anything but the id
primary key field. Because of the integrity constraints that I had
put on the Blogs table, PostgreSQL stopped the test, indicating that
it would not allow NULL values in the title field.
</p><p>
The second time I tried to run the tests, Rails picked up an error in
my YAML file, reminding me that the YAML format requires consistent
indentation with spaces and without any tab characters.
</p><p>
Rails wisely distinguishes between failures and errors; both of
the above were classified as errors, letting me focus on the overall
test environment rather than a particular method.
</p><p>
We can add additional tests by defining new methods. For example,
let's check that the title of @blog matches the value we put in
the YAML file. We can add the following to the BlogTest class
definition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def test_title
assert_equal @blogs["blog_entry_one"]["title"], @blog.title
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how our test begins with the characters test_. This tells
Rails that this method should be part of our test suite. Because each
individual method is counted separately, it is probably best to have a
large number of test methods, each of which contains a small number
of assertions. There is no technical reason why you cannot put a
large number of assertions in the same method, but it means you
might have a tougher time understanding just where the problem lies.
</p><p>
In this case, we are using assert_equal to check that two quantities
are equal. Pay close attention to the very similar names, and you will
see what we are doing. The first item to test for equality is
@blogs[&ldquo;blog_entry_one&rdquo;][&ldquo;title&rdquo;]. The @blogs hash is created
automatically for us by the test suite, and (as mentioned earlier)
contains the entire YAML fixture definition file. If @blogs contains
the entire YAML definition, then @blogs[&ldquo;blog_entry_one&rdquo;] contains the
first fixture, and @blogs[&ldquo;blog_entry_one&rdquo;][&ldquo;title&rdquo;] contains the
title of the first one.
</p><p>
@blog, by contrast, has a singular name because it contains only a
single instance of Blog. And like all good objects descended from
ActiveRecord, we can use a method to retrieve the contents of a
field&mdash;in this case, @blog.title. So, the bottom line is that this test
helps us check that the title is the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290b8f0"></a>
More Testing</h2></div></div><p>
The above are only two of the types of tests you might want to use on
your system. Rails comes with a large collection of assertions,
allowing you to test your models in a great variety of ways.
</p><p>
Remember that methods are just one part of the testing equation; you
also will want to have appropriate integrity constraints and checks in
your table definitions, and a wide variety of inputs to ensure that
you are checking many different possibilities. One way to create a
large number of fixtures is by creating them dynamically, using the
same syntax (known as ERb, or Embedded Ruby) that is used in Rails
views.
</p><p>
As I mentioned above, functional tests are another important element
in any application's test suite. Functional tests, which operate
against Rail controllers, work similarly to our unit tests&mdash;in the
tests/functional directory, with one test object per controller, and
with a test_ method for each method in the controller object.
Testing models ensures that your data is going to be robust; testing
controllers ensures that no matter what inputs you receive from
users via the Web, the application will handle the situation
gracefully.
</p><p>
Finally, Rails makes it easy to create mock objects, allowing us easily to
pretend that an object has been created. For example, we might
want to pretend that a credit-card transaction has gone through, or
that we have sent e-mail to 50,000 users of our system, without
actually carrying out the task.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Web applications are becoming large and sophisticated enough that they
demand disciplined testing techniques to avoid unforeseen problems.
Ruby on Rails comes with an integrated test system that makes it easy
to create and use tests at all levels&mdash;database, model objects and
controller objects. It shouldn't come as any surprise that many Ruby
developers are fans of test-driven development, in part because Ruby
and the Rails environment make it so easy to accomplish. If you are
going to develop with Rails, it's worth taking the extra time to add
tests into your application. It's easy to do, and it will save you a
great deal of time later on.
