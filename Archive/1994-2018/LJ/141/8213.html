Learn about some of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries and how
to use them with gEvas for high performance in your next GTK+2 application.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b6580.0x17ae298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Evas library provides a canvas for quickly rendering raster
graphics with alpha blending support. Evas is part of the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), a suite of libraries
originally built to support Enlightenment DR 17. Other libraries in the
EFL that complement Evas are the Edje and Embryo combination and the
Emotion library. Edje allows you to wrap up fonts, graphics and
functionality into portable theme-like files.
Embryo is a simple yet Turing complete scripting language that enables
simple scripts to be embedded into Edje files. Emotion allows you to have
many video streams as first-class canvas objects. This means you can alpha
blend video, move video objects around, resize them and layer them in
the canvas while playing.
</p><p>
gEvas is a wrapper and glue library built to allow Evas to be used
from GTK+2.x applications easily. In order to motivate you to try gEvas,
I present here the points that originally motivated me to use Evas and
subsequently create gEvas. My major motivations to use Evas were its
simple API and great render speed for an alpha-blended canvas.
</p><p>
Making claims of high render speed unfortunately
requires a brief trip into the benchmarking world.
The evas_bench application from the Evas distribution
involves many pixmap canvas items, scaling and
blending of pixmap items and text elements. The
image scaling is nowhere near as extreme as the
above resize benchmarks. I have ported evas_bench
to using GNOME Canvas.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the GNOME Canvas port of evas_bench.
I have also created some simpler
tests for the canvas scaling algorithm both with and without forcing
alpha blends on each frame.
For the non-alpha-blended version, a leaf image is resized from larger
than full-canvas width to 0 by 0 and back again in a loop; see Figure 2.
For the alpha-blended version, a red rectangle image of the same size as
the leaf image was used ranging from 0 alpha in the top left to full
alpha in the bottom.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8213f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. gEvas version of gnome_canvas scaling and compositioning benchmark.
The leaf is resized gradually to retract to the top left of the canvas and
then return to this original size again.
</p></div></div><p>
As stated above, I created gEvas, and some readers may notice that I am
a part of the Enlightenment developers team. Although this is true, I have
gone to lengths to ensure that the benchmarks are not biased. The benchmark
source code is available (see the on-line Resources). Those reading the source, please
excuse the excessive use of less-than-optimal coding conventions used in
the quick code hack.
</p><p>
For those unfamiliar with GNOME Canvas, it has two rendering back ends.
From the GNOME Canvas developer documentation (see Resources):
&ldquo;...It [GNOME Canvas] offers a choice of two
rendering back ends, one based on Xlib for extremely fast display, and
another based on Libart, a sophisticated, anti-aliased, alpha-compositing
engine.&rdquo; Evas attempts to provide the best of both worlds. I benchmark
Evas against both GNOME Canvas rendering engines.
</p><p>
There are also reasons why Evas might not be an appropriate choice.
GNOME Canvas supports a Bezier path canvas item that, at present, Evas
does not support. In addition, Evas and gEvas are less likely than GNOME
Canvas to be preinstalled.
</p><p>
Evas may get beziers in the future. The summary of this point from
Raster (aka Carsten Haitzler) was: &ldquo;If you are after a vector
editor suite or something, GNOME Canvas is
better. If you want real time fast, alpha-blended object display on all
targets, Evas is a good choice.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Evas itself supports multiple back-end render targets,
including the framebuffer, XLib and OpenGL. At present,
gEvas uses only the XLib Evas back end. However, as GTK+2
can run on the framebuffer, you should be able to use gEvas on
the framebuffer too, but this is untested.
</p><p>
Both GNOME Canvas and Evas share a similar data model. The Qt QCanvas data model
is different enough to make clean benchmark comparisons difficult.
The first major difference that makes comparisons difficult is how QCanvas handles images.
To put an image on the canvas, you create a QCanvasSprite with a single frame.
To scale that image, you then use QImage::scale() or
QImage::smoothScale(), which
gives you back an image that you can use to update your sprite. This puts image scaling
and the cache handling for scaled images into the client application.
Both Evas and GNOME Canvas allow canvas objects to be resized directly and thus take responsibility for
handling the caching of scaled images for you.
</p><p>
The second difference is that Qt gives you control over the update tile size.
The Qt documentation recommends:
&ldquo;A good rule of thumb is that the size should be a bit smaller than the
average canvas item size. If you have moving objects, the chunk size
should be a bit smaller than the average size of the moving
items.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Due to the data model differences, I haven't created a Qt port of
evas_bench as yet. I did create a canvas scaling and blending client,
although there are some canvas design issues affecting a clean comparison.
</p><p>
With Qt moving the cache policy fully in the client, I have chosen to
cache all scaled images in the first iteration of scaling and reset the
benchmark start timer for further iterations that will use only the cache.
</p><p>
So keep in mind that the Qt resize benchmark is performed with all
resized images pre-cached and many user-specified tile sizes are used
for benchmarking. This effectively should give QCanvas a huge speed
advantage over Evas and GNOME Canvas.

Let's Race Them</h2></div></div><p>
The results should be similar on a relative basis no matter what
hardware is used. For the sake of completeness, my testing CPU was an AMD XP-Mobile
running at 2.4GHz with 200MHz FSB, with 1GB of RAM at 400MHz dual-channel cas222 and and NVIDIA 5900 video card. The software that may affect performance includes
xorg-x11-6.8.2-1.FC3.13, either GCC 4.0.0 20050308 (Red Hat 4.0.0-0.32)
or GCC 3.4.3. X11 was configured with TwinView with one 1024x768 and one
1600x1200 screen, both running 85Hz in 32-bit color. TwinView should not affect runtimes because all canvases
are using software render paths that should be more sensitive to CPU/RAM speed.
</p><p>
Using client libraries qt-3.3.4, libgnomecanvas-2.10.0
recompiled with below CFLAGS, Evas CVS checked out on May 28, 2005.
Evas was compiled with GCC 3.4.3 with the below CFLAGS. Benchmark
compiled code CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are generally:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-O3 -march=athlon-xp -fomit-frame-pointer
</pre>
</p><p>
I benchmarked the qt-canvas-resize client separately because of the image caching
distinction and chunk-size optimizations mentioned above.
Shown in Table 1 are the benchmarks for qt-canvas-resize, where the Qt part of the
main loop consists of:


<pre     class="programlisting">
QCanvasSprite* leaf_sprite = ...;
QCanvasPixmapArray* leaf_tiles = ...;
while( running )
{
  while( app-&gt;hasPendingEvents() )
    app-&gt;processEvents();
  QImage im = ... from cache ...;
  QCanvasPixmap* qpix = new QCanvasPixmap( im );
  leaf_tiles-&gt;setImage( 0, qpix );
  leaf_sprite-&gt;setFrame(0);
  canvas-&gt;update();
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The client has several command-line options: --alpha-blend-image is used
to alpha-blend the red rectangle instead of the leaf, and --chunk-size is
used to specify a non-default chunk size. The --alpha-blend-image option is
common to qt-canvas-resize, gnome-canvas-resize and (g)evas-resize.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x16b6580.0x17aef50"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. qt-canvas-resize Benchmarks with Different Tile
Sizes</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. qt-canvas-resize Benchmarks with Different Tile&#10;Sizes" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Application</th><th>Chunk size</th><th>Leaf image FPS</th><th>Alpha rectangle FPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>qt-canvas-resize</td><td>default</td><td>114</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>qt-canvas-resize</td><td>32</td><td>128</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>qt-canvas-resize</td><td>64</td><td>136</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>qt-canvas-resize</td><td>128</td><td>142</td><td>81</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Running the default chunk-size leaf image qt-canvas-resize through valgrind's callgrind
for a few minutes reveals that QCanvas::update() gets 30% overall
runtime, with 59% of runtime used by QCanvasPixmap::init(). So the benchmark could be considerably
better if the pre-cached images are stored in a QCanvasPixmapArray for the sprite.
</p><p>
To test this level of pre-caching, I added the -Z
option to put all of the cache images into a single
QCanvasPixmapArray, which is the backing for the
QCanvasSprite. With this optimization, 559 FPS can be
achieved with 78% of runtime in QCanvas::update()
and 7% in QCanvasSprite::setFrame(). It has to be
noted that this level of pre-caching presents a
unfair advantage for QCanvas for rendering speed.
</p><p>
The GNOME Canvas client for image scale and blend is
gnome-canvas-resize, which has an --aa option to choose
the GNOME Canvas alpha-blending back end. evas-resize
has no custom options.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x16b6580.0x17afaa8"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 2. GNOME Canvas vs. (g)Evas in the Resize Benchmark
</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 2. GNOME Canvas vs. (g)Evas in the Resize Benchmark&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Application</th><th>Leaf image FPS</th><th>Alpha rectangle FPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>gnome-canvas-resize</td><td>21</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>gnome-canvas-resize --aa</td><td>149</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>

Without the --aa option, gnome-canvas-resize spends 99% of its time inside
gtk_widget_send_expose(), which is called one way or another from
g_main_context_iteration(). I don't think that the non-aa GTK+2 engine
likes being used in a flat-out benchmark manner. Using callgrind on the
--aa GNOME Canvas back end finds 96% of its time spent in gtk_widget_send_expose(),
although now we can see 66% of the time in gdk_pixbuf_composite() is called indirectly
from gtk_widget_send_expose().
</p><p>
evas-resize is spending 99% of its time in evas_render_updates().
Of the functions called from evas_render_updates(), 91% is spent scaling
functions.
</p><p>
I also ported the evas-resize to using gEvas and its API calls.
Although there is some speed loss due to the GTK+ signal glue and
other gEvas trimmings, the loss is not too significant.
</p><p>
This comparison shows that for outright image scaling, GNOME Canvas and QCanvas are
similar and both are slower than Evas. Evas gains further ground when the scaled
image also needs to be alpha-blended to the background.
</p><p>
I modified the original evas_bench application to remove the use of
features not easy to replicate in GNOME Canvas. Other
features became optional to measure their impact on overall
performance. The setting of clip zones in Evas is not an easy thing to
port to GNOME Canvas, so these were disabled in the evas_bench. Smooth
scaling also can have a strong impact on performance, so an option to
turn that off for the Evas version was added.

It should be noted that Evas doesn't currently implement a cache for
scaled images. So every frame in the Evas benchmarks is performing an
image scale and blend.
</p><p>
The evas_buffer_test client performs the same work but only renders
the output to a 32-bit RGBA image buffer in memory.

gEvas</h2></div></div><p>
At its core, gEvas provides five things: it tells Evas when to repaint
itself, assists in gluing Evas events and glib2 signals
together, handles Edje timer calls to support animation, helps Evas
play nice with GTK+2 widgets and codes to assist in Evas usage.
Because Evas also is being targeted at embedded systems, some handy
code is left out of the core Evas to make it lean. Because gEvas is
desktop-targeted, it adds some handy functionality for desktop applications.
</p><p>
The following code creates a gEvas canvas inside a scrollable area and attaches
it to a GTK+2 window. As not every scrollable gEvas will want to allow
the middle button to drag the canvas position&mdash;as in The
GIMP&mdash;you have to set this up outside of gevas_new_gtkscrolledwindow():


<pre     class="programlisting">

GtkWidget* window = 0;
GtkWidget* scw    = 0;
GtkWidget* gevas  = 0;

window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
gevas_new_gtkscrolledwindow(
   (GtkgEvas**)(&amp;gevas), &amp;scw );
gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), scw);

gtk_scrolled_window_set_policy(
   GTK_SCROLLED_WINDOW(scw),
   GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC, GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC);

gevas_set_middleb_scrolls(GTK_GEVAS(gevas), 1,
  gtk_scrolled_window_get_hadjustment(
     GTK_SCROLLED_WINDOW(scw)),
  gtk_scrolled_window_get_vadjustment(
     GTK_SCROLLED_WINDOW(scw)));

</pre>
</p><p>
The gEvas API for creating objects takes a leaf from standard GTK+
coding, having some methods attached to a general GtkgEvasObj
class. Other special classes, such as GtkgEvasImage, are derived from
GtkgEvasObj. Unfortunately, this also brings the usual cast-heavy style
of ANSI C GTK+ programming.
</p><p>
The following creates an image showing your PNG file at its original
width and height. We then move the image and raise its layer in the
canvas:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GtkgEvasImage* gi;
GtkgEvasObj* go;

gi = gevasimage_new_from_metadata(
        GTK_GEVAS(gevas), "/my/path/foo.png" );
go = GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi );

int x = 100, y = 50;
gevasobj_move(      go, x, y );
gevasobj_set_layer( go, 1 );
</pre>
</p><p>
I created a simple client showing how to connect Evas events from the
canvas to some GTK+2 widgets outside the gEvas widget. Look in the
demo directory of the gEvas package for signalconnect.c. For a more-advanced example, take a look at the testgevas client for the use of
both raw Evas callbacks and Evas-triggered callbacks that are
marshaled to glib signals. Signalconnect is shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8213f3.large.jpg"><img src="8213f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Connecting Evas and GTK+ signals. The dinosaur image can be
dragged around either directly or by moving the slider bar.
</p></div></div><p>
Connecting to Evas events is handled by way of
the GtkgEvasEvHClass subclasses. The below fragment causes evh to
marshal Evas' mouse up/down events into glib signals, which then are
connected to reporting functions. Also, when the user moves the raptor
image, raptor_moved() is called by way of a glib2 signal to update
various GTK+2 widgets with the current coordinates of the image:


<pre     class="programlisting">
static gint raptor_moved(
    GtkgEvasObj* o,
    Evas_Coord* x, Evas_Coord* y,
	gpointer user_data )
{
 gtk_progress_bar_set_fraction( x_coord_tracker,
      (1.0 * (*x)) / CANVAS_WIDTH );
 gtk_range_set_value(
      GTK_RANGE(y_coord_tracker), *y );

 return GEVASOBJ_SIG_OK;
}

static gboolean
gtk_mouse_down_cb(GtkObject * object,
 GtkObject * gevasobj, gint _b, gint _x, gint _y,
 gpointer data)
{
 char buffer[1024];
 snprintf(buffer,1000,"mouse_down b:%d x:%d y:%d",
          _b, _x, _y);
 gtk_label_set_text( e_logo_label, buffer );
 return FALSE;
}

...
gi = gevasimage_new();
go = GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi );
gevasimage_set_image_name( gi, "raptor.png" );
...

/** Let the user drag the raptor around **/
GtkObject *evh = gevasevh_drag_new();
gevasobj_add_evhandler( GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi ), evh );

gtk_signal_connect( go, "move_absolute",
   GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC( raptor_moved ), go );

gi = gevasimage_new();
go = GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi );
gevasimage_set_image_name( gi, "e_logo.png" );
...

evh = gevasevh_to_gtk_signal_new();
gevasobj_add_evhandler( GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi ), evh );

gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(evh), "mouse_down",
  GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(gtk_mouse_down_cb), NULL);
gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(evh), "mouse_up",
  GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(gtk_mouse_up_cb), NULL);
</pre>
</p><p>
The following are some more functional event handlers that can be
attached:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/* Standard GTK+ popup menu creation + handling */
static gboolean
gtk_popup_activate_cb(GtkObject * object,
   GtkObject * gevasobj, gint _b, gint _x, gint _y,
   gpointer data)
{
 static GtkMenu *menu = 0;
 ...
}

GtkgEvasObj* go  = ...;
GtkObject*   evh = 0;

/* Make the object throb when mouse is over it */
GtkgEvasEvHThrob* evht = gevasevh_throb_new( go );

/* Allow the user to drag the object around  */
evh = gevasevh_drag_new();
gevasobj_add_evhandler( go, evh );

/* Make a popup menu appear on right mouse click */
evh = gevasevh_popup_new();
gevasobj_add_evhandler( go, evh );

gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(evh),"popup_activate",
   GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(gtk_popup_activate_cb), NULL);
</pre>
</p><p>
Handling a selection in the canvas is a little
trickier than the above event handlers. This is so
because more than one object is involved in
the selection process. You create a selector event
handler object of class GtkgEvasEvHGroupSelector that
attaches to the object you want as the background
unselectable object. You can think of this object
as where the rubber-band rectangle is drawn to
indicate which objects should become selected. The
rubber band always is drawn at a higher layer than
the selectable objects. Each selectable object
on the canvas then has a GtkgEvasEvHSelectable
object attached to it that communicates with the
GtkgEvasEvHGroupSelector object:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GtkWidget*     gevas = ...;
GtkObject*     evh_selector = 0;
GtkgEvasImage* gevas_image;

gevas_image = gevasimage_new();
gevasobj_set_gevas(gevas_image, gevas);
gevasimage_set_image_name(gevas_image,".../bg.png");

/* Make this a group_selector */
evh_selector = gevasevh_group_selector_new();
gevasevh_group_selector_set_object(
  (GtkgEvasEvHGroupSelector*)evh_selector,
  GTK_GEVASOBJ(gevas_image));

GtkgEvasObj* go  = ...;
make_selectable( gevas, go, evh_selector );

...

/* lets make this object also selectable */
void make_selectable( GtkgEvasObj* object,
                      GtkObject* evhsel )
{
 GtkgEvasObj* ct  = 0;
 GtkObject* evh = gevasevh_selectable_new( evhsel );
 gevasevh_selectable_set_confine(
    GTK_GEVASEVH_SELECTABLE(evh), 1 );

 gevasobj_add_evhandler(object, evh);
 gevasevh_selectable_set_normal_gevasobj(
    GTK_GEVASEVH_SELECTABLE(evh),  object);

 ct = (GtkgEvasObj*)gevasgrad_new(
     gevasobj_get_gevas( GTK_OBJECT(object)));

 gevasobj_set_color( ct, 255, 200, 255, 200);

 gevasgrad_add_color(ct, 120, 150, 170, 45, 8);
 gevasgrad_add_color(ct, 200, 170, 90, 150, 16);

 gevasgrad_set_angle(ct, 150);
 gevasobj_resize( ct, 200,100);
 gevasobj_set_layer(ct, 9999);

 gevasevh_selectable_set_selected_gevasobj(evh,ct);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can easily test if objects are selected or
get a collection object to perform operations on all
objects selected:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GtkgEvasEvHGroupSelector* ev = ...;
GtkgEvasEvHSelectable*    o  = ...;
GtkgEvasObjCollection*    col = 0;

gboolean yn = gevasevh_group_selector_isinsel(ev,o);
col = gevasevh_group_selector_get_collection( ev );
gevas_obj_collection_move_relative( col, 100, 200 );
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition, some objects, such as geTransAlphaWipe, were
created to perform image transitions before Edje existed. Although Edje
is the way of the future, the alphawipe code allows you to perform a
common simple transition without involving Edje. This is used in gevasanim
to create a sprite-like object that transitions between its frames using
alpha blending.
</p><p>
The xxx_from_metadata() functions in gEvas allow you to set up
location, image filename, visibility and other attributes for a new object
using a single string. Both the from_metadata() and the transition code duplicate
functionality now also available in Edje:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sprite = gevas_sprite_new( GTK_GEVAS(gevas) );

for( i=1; i&lt;frame_count; ++i )
{
 gchar* md = g_strdup_printf(
   "cell%ld.png?x=120&amp;y=120&amp;visible=0&amp;fill_size=1"
   ,i);
 gi = gevasimage_new_from_metadata( GTK_GEVAS(gevas), md );
 g_free( md );
 gevas_sprite_add( sprite, GTK_GEVASOBJ( gi ) );
}

gevas_sprite_set_default_frame_delay( sprite,2000 );
gevas_sprite_play_forever( sprite );

/* frame transitions */
geTransAlphaWipe* trans = 0;
trans = gevastrans_alphawipe_new();
for( i=0; i&lt;frame_count; ++i )
 gevas_sprite_set_transition_function(
     sprite, i, trans );

</pre>
</p><p>
For the grand finale, I put an Edje object onto the gEvas canvas.
The client I created to demonstrate for this article is demo/gevasedje
in the gEvas distribution. The interesting parts are shown below. The
Edje itself has an Enlightenment logo that spins around and one that
throbs under mouse clicks:

I have omitted memory consumption figures from the article in order to
conserve space, as those figures are less important for modern desktop machines. A future
benchmark will pit QTCanvas resizing against an Edje resize program to provide a
more fair comparison between those two.

If you are looking for a canvas for a new GTK+2 application, consider
both GNOME Canvas and gEvas plus Edje before hacking.
