Use your Linux box for professional-quality printed circuit board design

A lot of attention&mdash;and hype&mdash;has focused on bringing
traditional office-productivity
programs, such as the OpenOffice.org suite, to Linux. However, another important&mdash;and
far less-hyped&mdash;area where Linux's desktop abilities come to the fore
is in engineering software, and in particular, CAD (computer-aided design).
</p><p>
Non-engineers tend to think of the term CAD as referring to mechanical
design software, and they are partially right. We are used to seeing
complicated drawings of mechanical assemblies appearing on computer screens
in advertising and television. However, CAD doesn't mean only mechanical
design. Electronics designers also long have used computer-based design
tools to help them perform their design tasks.
</p><p>
The area of CAD software used for electronics design is typically referred
to as EDA, short for electronic design automation. Happily for Linux
users, many EDA applications&mdash;both proprietary and
open source&mdash;are now available for Linux. Perhaps the largest and oldest open-source
project is the gEDA Project. The gEDA Project
is an active community of hackers who have developed
high-quality EDA applications for many different
electronic design tasks. In this article, we examine a set of
gEDA programs you can use to design your own circuit boards from scratch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdb580.0xdd3450"></a>
EDA Overview</h2></div></div><p>
Designing circuits using EDA tools is analogous
to creating software using traditional software
engineering tools. That is, rather than using only
one program to accomplish a job, electrical
engineers will use a wide variety of tools, each
tailored to accomplish its particular
task efficiently. They use each tool in a sequence as they
progress from start to finish through their design
work, a concept known as design flow. This concept
should be familiar to software engineers who
might first use a flowcharting tool, then an editor,
followed by a compiler, then a debugger, as they create
applications ready for distribution.
</p><p>
Different types of circuit design use different
flows. For example, if you work on digital
electronics, you might code your design using a
hardware description language such as Verilog, and then
use a Verilog compiler followed by a waveform analyzer
to simulate and analyze it. On the other hand, if
you are doing analog circuit design, you might draw
your circuit using a schematic capture program,
and subsequently use a circuit simulation program, such as
SPICE, to verify its correctness before prededing
to create a PC board. Other, more-complicated designs
might require additional steps in the design flow.
</p><p>
In this article, our interest is to create
a garden-variety printed circuit board (PCB).
To create a simple circuit board using any EDA toolset&mdash;whether proprietary or open source&mdash;the design
flow looks like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Gather information about your design's requirements,
as well as find data sheets for available parts.
</p></li><li><p>
Create a high-level block diagram of your
design, using either paper and pencil or a
general-purpose drawing program such as Dia.
</p></li><li><p>
Enter your detailed design into the computer, and
draw its schematic using a special-purpose schematic
capture program.
</p></li><li><p>
Netlist your design's schematic, meaning that
you export a so-called netlist that captures
all your design's components and connections in a
special-purpose file format.
</p></li><li><p>
Read the netlist into a layout editor, which is a
special-purpose drawing program for creating PCBs.
Use the layout editor to create a drawing of your PC
board's physical layout.
</p></li><li><p>
Export Gerber files from your layout program.
The Gerber files are industry-standard files that
describe your PCB to your PCB manufacturer.
</p></li><li><p>
Send the Gerber files to a PCB fabricator.
</p></li><li><p>
Receive your freshly manufactured PCBs, populate
them with components and test them out.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
At any point in this flow, you might have to go
back and repeat a step if you find an error in a
proceeding step. Again, this is similar to software
engineering, where you have to go back to edit and
recompile your program if you find that it has a
runtime error. The only difference is that if you
take a PCB design to its completion by ordering
boards, and then you find a design error, you're
stuck with a batch of bad boards&mdash;you can't simply
delete your work and recompile.

Origins and History of gEDA</h2></div></div><p>
The gEDA Project was originated by Ales Hvezda in 1998. After
graduating from the University of New Mexico, he became interested in
robotics. Ales wanted to design circuits for robots using his Linux
box, but found that no suitable applications running on Linux
existed. Consequently, like so many open-source developers active in
other areas, he felt the itch to write his own EDA suite. Ales
scratched the itch by writing a schematic capture program and a
rudimentary netlister. He also created a Web site to share his
efforts, which he named the gEDA Project, because he wanted to release
his EDA creations under the GPL.
</p><p>
Very quickly, a small team of developers joined him and started
patching and adding to the gEDA tools. Others started contributing
tools of their own, some of them modest design utilities and others
major software projects in their own right. In the latter category
fall the ngspice Project, which aims to develop an open-source
implementation of the popular analog simulator SPICE; Gnucap, an
analog/digital circuit simulator; and Icarus Verilog, a tool for
digital logic generation and simulation. Finally, a very important
allied program is pcb&mdash;the printed circuit board layout
editor.
</p><p>
Because his idea was met with such enthusiasm, and so many tools
allied themselves with the gEDA Project, Ales decided to rename his
original suite of tools gEDA/gaf, an acronym for gschem and
friends. Meanwhile, the term gEDA Suite has come to designate the
entire ensemble of open-source EDA tools that have allied themselves
with the gEDA Project. A main distinction between gEDA/gaf and the
other tools is that the gaf tools tend to be used at the front-end
stages of a design, while the other tools are used in later stages.
</p><p>
Since he started it in 1998, gEDA/gaf has grown to a full suite of
front-end EDA applications. Besides the core programs gschem and
gnetlist, there are almost two-dozen contributed utility programs,
including an attribute manager, a symbol checker, an refdes generator
(or component numberer), symbol generators and file format conversion
utilities. Meanwhile, the various back-end tools, such as pcb,
ngspice and Gnucap have also evolved and matured, enabling a variety
of different flows adapted to different design types. Currently, the
design tools in the open-source gEDA Suite will support almost any
kind of low- to mid-level electronic design task, offering the same
power as tools costing thousands of dollars.
</p><p>
When discussing the future of EDA on Linux with my friends and
colleagues, I like to point out that Sun Microsystems became the
corporate giant it is today by offering a great platform for
engineering design. Linux can follow the same path to greatness
because it, too, offers a powerful platform for engineering
applications. Engineers are a natural customer base for Linux as they
are smart, technology-savvy and actually want to use UNIX-native power
tools such as TCL, Perl and Python to automate their work. Commercial
EDA vendors have just begun to realize the customer leverage they can
get from the Linux platform, and they are moving fast to serve that
market. However, open-source developers recognized the importance of
Linux to electronic design many years ago, and the maturity of the
gEDA Suite is proof of their early insight.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdb580.0xdd3ef8"></a>
Schematic Capture&mdash;gschem</h2></div></div><p>
A good way to understand how gEDA is used is to
examine its individual pieces in the context of the
overall design flow. The first design step involves
schematic capture&mdash;that is, using a specialized
drawing program to draw a schematic representation
of your circuit. The gEDA Suite's schematic capture
program is called gschem.
</p><p>
gschem is usually invoked from the command line;
once started, it opens up a GUI composed of a drawing
window surrounded by all the menus and buttons necessary
to draw a schematic. gschem, like any schematic
capture program, has a number of built-in graphical
primitives corresponding to wires, component pins,
resistors, capacitors, transistors and other items
you need to connect when creating a
circuit design. A screenshot of a typical session
with gschem is shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8438f1.large.jpg"><img src="8438f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. gschem in action. Here is a section of
a two-transistor microwave amplifier being drawn in
preparation for SPICE simulation.
</p></div></div><p>
As for electronic devices, gschem maintains a
library of component symbols, which are drawings of
individual circuit elements such as resistors, ICs,
connectors and anything else you might want
to place on your schematic. Each symbol is stored
as an ASCII file; when you place a component symbol
into your schematic, the corresponding symbol file
is opened up and the information contained in it is
used to draw the symbol on your screen.
</p><p>
Currently, gschem's symbol library holds more than 2,000
component symbols, including symbols for most common
electronic parts. However, engineers commonly
need to create new symbols for their designs, because it
is likely that not all the parts they want to use are
present in the symbol library. Therefore, gschem&mdash;like all schematic
capture programs&mdash;incorporates a
symbol editor, which allows users to create and
save their own symbols, which they can then use in
any design.
</p><p>
gschem understands electrical connectivity, an
important property for any schematic capture program.
That is, wires (called nets in EDA parlance) know
that they can connect only to component pins and
other nets. When two nets are connected together,
gschem knows to draw a large dot at the connection
point, indicating to the user that a connection exists
at that point.
</p><p>
gschem enables engineers to attach attributes
to each component, which is an important part of
creating a design. For example, if you have a 499-ohm resistor in your
schematic, gschem lets you
place a resistor symbol from the library, double-click
on the resistor and then attach a value=499 to the
resistor itself. Later, when the design is netlisted,
the component's attributes are written into the
netlist file and made available for other programs.
</p><p>
Finally, gschem saves your design in a well-documented
ASCII format. There are many advantages to ASCII file
formats; readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i> will appreciate
that ASCII files can be parsed and manipulated using
scripting languages, including Perl and Python.
Scripts facilitate labor-saving design tasks like
automated symbol generation and schematic merging.
Many proprietary EDA programs do not
use ASCII file formats because they are interested
in locking in customers. Open-source EDA advocates
believe that open file formats are a key superiority
of toolsets like gEDA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdb580.0xdd4420"></a>
Netlisting&mdash;gnetlist</h2></div></div><p>
After you have captured your schematic, the next
step in the design flow is to create a netlist.
gnetlist is the gEDA/gaf program used to generate
netlists from your schematic files. gnetlist is a
command-line utility; when you run it, it generates
output netlist files and also displays diagnostic
information in your terminal window.
</p><p>
So what's a netlist? A netlist is a file holding your
design's connectivity information in a structured
format suitable for machine processing. Many
different types of netlist exist; each represents
a file format optimized for a particular type of
subsequent processing. For example, SPICE analog
simulators read files written in the SPICE netlist
format, which calls out connections between analog
components, as well as specifies the values of each
component's parameters, such as a resistor's resistance.
As another example, netlists used as the input to
lay out programs typically hold information about each
component's PCB footprint, which is the metalization
pattern on the circuit board to which the component
is soldered, as well as connectivity information
between all component pins.
</p><p>
gnetlist is designed in a unique way. It incorporates
a front end written in C that reads and parses
your schematic files. Once the read-in is complete,
gnetlist invokes a back-end netlist generator written
in Scheme. The back end is specific to the desired
output netlist. The back end to use is specified
via a command-line flag when you invoke gnetlist.
gnetlist was designed this way to facilitate
easy extensibility. Users who want to create new
netlisters simply need to write a Scheme program
implementing their desired netlister; they don't
need to learn C or fool around with the internals
of reading or parsing schematic files.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, gnetlist can output more than
20 netlist formats. Among the important netlist
types output by gnetlist is SPICE. The powerful gEDA
SPICE netlister spice-sdb supports the inclusion of
vendor SPICE models into your spice netlist. It has
proven very popular with EE students worldwide,
perhaps because it is well documented in a HOWTO
available on the Web. Also, netlisters for
several different layout tools exist.
Finally, gnetlist is also used for BOM (bill of
materials) generation and DRC (design rule checking)
using any of several back ends crafted to achieve
these goals.
</p><p>
Important to PCB design is the question of how to
translate a gschem schematic into a format suitable
for layout using the open-source layout program pcb.
Although this can be done using gnetlist alone, the
procedure is complicated. Therefore, Bill Wilson
made a recent contribution to the gEDA Project by
writing gsch2pcb, a C utility that wraps gnetlist and
outputs the correct files to read into pcb for layout.
gsch2pcb is a key addition to the gEDA Suite because
it makes the transition from a gschem schematic to a
pcb layout easy, and it also illustrates the vibrancy
of the gEDA on-line community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdb580.0xdd4688"></a>
Layout&mdash;pcb</h2></div></div><p>
Once the initial layout files are created using gsch2pcb, you can lay
out your design. This involves using a layout editor&mdash;a specialized
drawing program to draw metal tracks, components, drill holes and other
structures onto your circuit board. The PCB layout tool used with gEDA
is called, appropriately enough, pcb. pcb usually is invoked from the
command line; once running, it presents a drawing window accompanied by
all the widgets and tools necessary to draw your circuit board. A screenshot
of pcb in action is shown in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8438f2.large.jpg"><img src="8438f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A board layout in pcb. The red lines
represent metal traces connecting the components
on the top layer of the board; the large blue area
corresponds to a ground plane on the back layer of
the board. A number of component footprints
also are visible.
</p></div></div><p>
The history of pcb is quite interesting. It
originally was written by Thomas Nau in 1990 for the
Atari ST. Thomas ported pcb to UNIX in 1994 and
used the Xaw (X11) widget set for its GUI. In about
1998, Harry Eaton took over maintaining the program,
and&mdash;among many other contributions&mdash;implemented
the ability to output Gerber files. pcb was placed on
Sourceforge.net about two years ago, and it is currently
maintained by Harry, D. J. Delorie (of djgcc fame)
and Dan McMahill. Most recently, Bill Wilson (author
of gsch2pcb) updated pcb's GUI to use GTK+, a very
welcome modernization.
</p><p>
Creating a circuit board layout using pcb, as with
any layout editor, involves first placing
the component footprints and then routing the metal
connections&mdash;called tracks or traces&mdash;between the
pins of the footprint. pcb allows you to define the
track width to use, which is important when,
for example, drawing power (usually thick) traces,
as opposed to signal (usually thin) ones.
</p><p>
As for component footprints, pcb supports two
different footprint libraries: a legacy library based
upon the M4 macro language and a newer library
(newlib), which defines footprints via an ASCII
file defining all graphical elements composing the
footprint, such as metal pads and rings, drill holes,
silk-screened text and so on. When rendering your
layout, pcb uses footprints from either library
to draw the footprint required by each component; the
footprints used are those called out by the footprint
attribute specified in your gschem schematic.
</p><p>
Since pcb's newlib defines footprints using an ASCII
file format, automated generation of footprints using
scripts is possible. To this end, another member
of the gEDA community, John Luciani, has created a
large collection of useful pcb footprints using Perl
scripts; both scripts and the generated pcb footprints
are available for free download from his Web site (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
pcb supports routing on up to eight layers, meaning that you can draw
metal connections on any of up to eight separate layers on the PCB itself.
This is important for enabling high-density component placements, which
are the norm for modern, compact designs. Connections between tracks
on different PCB layers are done by running a pair of tracks to a via,
which is a hole drilled through the PCB and subsequently plated with
metal, thereby electrically connecting tracks on one layer with tracks
on another.
</p><p>
Once you've completely laid out your board using pcb, you can generate
Gerber files, which is an industry-standard representation of your
board's layout. An assembly drawing, drill file and pick-and-place
file also are automatically created when you generate your Gerber files.
Send all these files to any PCB fabrication house, and soon you will
receive professional-quality PCBs designed by you on your Linux box!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdb580.0xdd4b58"></a>
A Finished Board</h2></div></div><p>
Once your bare PCBs come back, you either can stuff
(assemble) them yourself or send them to an
assembler to complete the job for you. Shown in
Figure 3 is an example PC board created using the
gEDA tools. This board is the same as that shown in
Figure 2. It is a two-layer board
that aggregates signals from several sensors and
routes them to an A/D module. This example board
is not particularly large or complex; larger and
more-complicated boards are regularly done using the
gEDA tools. However, it does show a wide variety of
component types: several through-hole connectors,
surface-mount and through-hole devices, a 14-pin DIP
in a socket, as well as holes and other elements.
This illustrates the ability of pcb to handle many
different types of electrical components. To see
more boards done using the gEDA Suite, look at the
featured project on the gEDA Web site, or do a
quick Google search. The variety of possible circuit
boards is limited only by your imagination!
