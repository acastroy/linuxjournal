How to use DVDStyler, a DVD-authoring solution that complements Kino.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1616580.0x170e3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As a user of Linux for nearly two years, one thing I have found is
that it has been lacking in software solutions for video production. I'm
happy to report that this situation has changed for the better. For the
past six
months, I've have been using Kino 0.7.5 for my video editing with
results equal to and in some ways better than what's offered in some
Windows video-editing solutions or Apple's iMovie. Now there is a
DVD-authoring solution that complements Kino by being user-friendly
and creating authored DVDs that will play on most post-2000 DVD
players. It's called DVDStyler, and in this article, I show you how to use it and some
of the options it offers to create as simple or elaborate a menu as
you want for your video DVDs.
</p><p>
First, you need a few dependencies in
place before you install DVDStyler: wxGTK, DVDAuthor, MJPEG
Tools, MPEG Toolbox (mpgtx), Xine or Kaffeine (optional, for previewing
video) and Totem (optional, for generation of thumbnails). Any of these
can be found at your favorite RPM or Debian package resource, like those
provided in the on-line Resources for this article.
DVDStyler creates only video DVDs. It does not create video on CD,
better known as VCD and SVCD. If you don't have a DVD burner, you're
unfortunately out of luck as far as using DVDStyler. Now, let's get to the business
of creating a DVD video after editing a video in Kino.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f1.large.jpg"><img src="8413f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The first step in making a DVD is to export your
movie from Kino in MPEG-2 format.
</p></div></div><p>
In Figure 1, you can see the Kino export screen.
If you're using Kino 0.7.5
or higher, you already should have the dependencies
needed to create a DVD-quality MPEG-2 video file,
as you can see in the video and audio windows. Make sure you
export to a destination where you can find the file
easily. This destination is where DVDStyler will find your video
for authoring later. Next, click the export button
and the conversion to MPEG-2
begins. Depending on the length of your video,
this process could be lengthy. Expect it to take
roughly two minutes of rendering for every minute of
video. So a half-hour movie would take about an hour
to render. Obviously, processor speed figures somewhat
into this too.
Once
rendering is completed, you can move on to using DVDStyler
to author your movie.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f2.large.jpg"><img src="8413f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. DVDStyler starts with a blank main screen and
a selection of menu backgrounds.
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 2 shows what you see when you first click on DVDStyler.
Default menu backgrounds are available if you don't have a still picture or a
video clip of your own to use (more on this later). First, go
to the top of the page and set the configuration of DVDStyler.
Click Configuration, then Settings, and choose your language and default
format (NTSC for North America, PAL for most other parts of planet
Earth).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f3.large.jpg"><img src="8413f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Core settings tab lets you set your programs
of choice for previewing video and burning to DVD.
</p></div></div><p>
Next, click on the Core tab to see all the commands
and dependencies that are used. The preview and burn
commands use Xine by default for previewing, but if you're like
me and use Kaffeine, simply type in Kaffeine where it says Xine, so
you can preview before burning. Now you are ready to begin inserting your
files for menu creation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f4.large.jpg"><img src="8413f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Now you're ready to start building a DVD. Drag the video files you
want to use to the time line at the bottom of the screen.
</p></div></div><p>
Click on the top-left corner, under the word File on the white square
icon to start a new project. If you were returning to a project you
already started, you would click the yellow folder icon next to it to
find your saved project. Next, on the left side, click on the
Directories tab, and you should see all the media files in the current folder
that are compatible for DVD creation in
DVDStyler. Simply click and drag any of those files you want to use in
your DVD to the bottom of the screen to the right of the Menu 1
thumbnail, in the sequence you want, from left to right. This area is
commonly referred to as the time line. Now you are ready to create a
background for your menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f5.large.jpg"><img src="8413f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can use a still photo or a video clip for a menu background.
</p></div></div><p>
There are several ways to do this, and each way has nearly infinite
possibilities for background creation. First, if you want to do it the
easiest way (the best choice if you've never authored a DVD before),
simply choose one of the JPEG pictures offered with DVDStyler. Left-click
once on your choice, and then drag it over to the left and into the
main screen area. If you want to use a still photo or a video
clip for a background, it involves a little more work&mdash;here's how.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f6.large.jpg"><img src="8413f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Select the photo you want to use for a menu background,
then drag it to the main screen.
</p></div></div><p>
For a still photo, go to the Directories tab again and open
the folder where your pictures reside. In my example
in Figure 6, you see the open My Pictures folder and all of the pictures in
that folder. I simply chose the one I wanted to use, left-clicked once
and dragged it over to the main screen area, exactly like we did in the
first example. The small one (320a) is the one I used for the background.
</p><p>
The reason it is smaller is because I had to resize it using The GIMP
before I could use it as a background, as the original size was
much larger than what would fit for a menu background. Any still photo
needs to be the same size as the NTSC ratio (or
PAL) video ratio. In the case of NTSC, it's 720 x 480. If you use a
larger photo, you'll end up with some (or a lot) of it framed off. In a
DVD menu, a still photo is simply seen as a still frame of video. If you
use a pre-edited video clip for your background (something short,
10&ndash;60 seconds long), the process is a little different. Simply click on the
Directories tab, navigate the tree to the folder where your video clips
are located, and then open that folder, double-click on the video clip
and you will
see the video's file path in your main screen area. You won't actually
see the video play at this point, only the words displaying the file
path. When your DVD is authored, you will see the video in the background.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to talk about the most important function in DVD
authoring, creating buttons. The buttons are what you and other viewers
of your DVD will navigate to on the menu to trigger the playback of
whichever video clip they want on the menu. The first step in creating a
button is to click on the Buttons tab. Then, click and drag the word
button to the right of the directory and move it to wherever you want
to place the button on the background. Don't worry if you change your
mind on the placement later, you still can move it somewhere else on the
background and not affect the properties of the button itself. Once your
button is on the background, right-click on the word button and choose
Properties. You will then see what's shown in Figure 7. Where it says
action-jump titles, it is referring to the titles of the movie clips
you chose and put on the time line at the bottom of the screen earlier.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f7.large.jpg"><img src="8413f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The button Properties dialog lets you set
the text and associated actions for a button.
</p></div></div><p>
Click on the scrollbar to the right of jump title and you'll see all
of the movie titles on your time lime to be represented by button 1.
Button 1 doesn't have to be tied to title 1. It can trigger any movie
title on the time line; it's your choice. However, you may find it
easier to keep buttons and titles tied together
chronologically. After you choose which title you want for the button,
you also can choose what color background to have behind the text of
your button, the color and font for your text and whether it
becomes highlighted when navigated to and after it is clicked on when
played back on a DVD player.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f8.large.jpg"><img src="8413f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. You can set the colors and font for text from the same dialog.
</p></div></div><p>
These choices are made right below where the text was entered. In the
area called text, it says Title 1 by default. You will want to
change that to a name that makes sense to the viewer of the video. One
more thing to remember, if you have to stop in the middle of authoring,
make sure you click the Save icon in the upper-left corner of the screen
before you exit or all of your hard work will be lost. That's it. Now, if
you're a more-advanced user, you can create title sets, submenus
and make the video background loop. Your options are plentiful. The
DVDStyler user guide (a free download from the DVDStyler Web site) goes
into great detail explaining how to do everything to create a simple
or complicated DVD menu. That's what I think is so great about this
application. It's simple enough to use for a beginner, but it also has
a lot of more-advanced features that can be used if you know how.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8413f9.large.jpg"><img src="8413f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. When you're ready to burn the DVD, the Generate DVD dialog
keeps track of your progress.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's burn! The DVD that is.
Simply click on the gear-wheel icon below the word Configuration or
click on File in the upper-left corner and scroll down to the command
burn DVD. Here you either can preview your work before burning or you
can go straight to burning the DVD. When you do, you'll see displayed
all the commands that DVDStyler is giving to DVDAuthor to initiate the
burning process. If you haven't already inserted your DVD disk into your
DVD burner, do it now.
</p><p>
When you insert the DVD, if you get a prompt
like I do, asking if you want to start K3b, answer no. K3b is another
disk-burning application that many Linux distributions use for burning data
DVDs and CDs and audio CDs. It doesn't, however, author video DVDs for
DVD player playback. DVDStyler does all
the burning by itself. If you're using a distribution that has hotplug, you
don't have to mount or unmount your DVD burner.
Burning a DVD takes much longer than burning a CD,
because it stores much more data. The speed varies with different
burners; some
go faster than others. Mine is about two years old and burns DVDs only at
2x speed. For me, it takes roughly two minutes to burn every minute of
video. A DVD holds only about 58 minutes of MPEG-2-quality
video. So for me, it takes about two hours to burn a 58-minute video DVD.
If you have a newer 8x speed DVD burner, obviously it will go much
faster. Once the DVD is done burning, it will eject itself. Then, go play
it on your DVD player. Most players made after 2000 will play it. If
yours is older than that, don't be surprised if it won't play. If this
happens, go out and buy the cheapest DVD player you can find
($30), and it will play. If you don't want to do that, you always
can play it on your computer and navigate the video clips the same way you
would on a TV screen.
</p><p>
Video DVD authoring for Linux is a reality, and best of all, it's pretty
easy, even for newbie videographers. DVDStyler is one of the Linux
applications I have felt compelled to donate to, to help advance this
already good application. It's that good!
