From box-office hits to home movies, Linux is ready, set, action.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238c3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
From the operating system that gave you <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lord of the
Rings</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderman</em></span>
and pretty much every other film that's made these days, comes the Holy
Grail of Linux computing: the home and small office video production
pipeline. Unlike the object of Monty Python's ill-fated quest, however,
this long-sought treasure actually exists and is finally within reach.
</p><p>
The problem has been one of great frustration for many potential adopters:
what do I do about my home videos, my hobby films, my presentation
videos? These days, even the greenest newbies can bumble their way through
assembling a video in the tinkertoy-like Windows Movie Maker, and Mac
users are even better off. They have a proper consumer video editing
application: iMovie.
</p><p>
Linux has, for years, been growing into a major standard in the Hollywood
studio pipeline. A cursory glance at the CinePaint Web site reveals a
catalog of films that could not have been produced on time or budget
(if at all) without a Linux infrastructure. Without Linux, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span>
prequels would have had a different look, and there would have been no
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></span> trilogy. From its early days on the renderfarms to its
coming of age in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shrek</em></span>, Linux has proved time and again its effectiveness,
power and stability to the major studios.
</p><p>
None of which does the hobbyist user much good. Typically, filmmaking
software for Linux is dearly bought; Eyeon's DFX compositing system,
the most reasonably priced of any professional Linux-based compositing
systems, weighs in at a hefty $1,295 US per seat, and it's the least capable
player in the field. The home producer historically sits in the worst
possible spot: atop a free and exceedingly capable operating system that
was powering the major motion picture studios, without any way to get
in on the fun short of writing a lot of scripts and working from the
command line a great deal.
</p><p>
During the last three years, that situation has changed. Although the
situation is not yet ideal, the FLOSS end of the Linux universe now
allows for a near-complete, end-user-oriented production pipeline. I
know, because during the last four years, I've built up a production studio
running entirely on Linux&mdash;with one gap in the pipeline&mdash;and I make
my living using it.
</p><p>
Let's say you want to edit your brother's wedding video to produce a short
film with an alien sitting in the audience as a guest. In the Windows
and Mac worlds, several companies offer end-to-end commercial solutions
that take you from acquisition through delivery-format authoring, covering
(in no particular order) editing, titling, compositing, color correction,
sound/score sequencing and DVD mastering. 3-D graphics applications are
easily obtainable from a variety of other companies, and for a variety
of prices. However, the companies producing such software will continue
ignoring the Linux market until their high-end customers force them to
produce Linux versions of their software (as happened in the 1990s with
the IRIX version of Photoshop).
</p><p>
Although it would be nice to have such tools, we're not going to get
them. And, I can finally say with confidence, the day approaches when
we won't need them, either.
</p><p>
To get a home or small-office production studio running, you need most
of the pipeline shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8589f1.large.jpg"><img src="8589f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Production Pipeline
</p></div></div><p>
Not everything will be needed for every project, and indeed most projects
will not approach this level of sophistication. Nevertheless, our Alien
Wedding Guest project will give it a thorough workout, enough to show
the weaknesses in the Linux pipeline as well as its strengths. To
that end, we do an overview of the basic post-production process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238cb30"></a>
Acquisition&mdash;Kino, Cinelerra, XFS</h2></div></div><p>
When choosing your acquisition format, your originating medium can be
just about any sort of video or film (see the Acquisition Means and
Formats sidebar).
</p><p>
Because the focus here is on home and small business, it's safe to
assume that the most common format for the next couple of years
is going to be MiniDV. Getting the footage into your computer is
fairly straightforward&mdash;DV comes in over the 1394 (FireWire) port,
which is well supported in all modern kernels, and dumps straight to
the hard drive. Be sure you have plenty of disk space&mdash;DV clocks in at
approximately 12.5GB/hr. In either case, either Kino and Cinelerra will
capture for you neatly, and variety of command-line tools exist as well.
</p><p>
There is a major technical issue to keep at the front of your mind:
video compression. Pretty much any video you import will have undergone
a compression pass. Edits don't usually require a second pass, so this isn't
much of a problem if your plan is to do a quick-and-dirty edit, perhaps
throw in a title, and output your video again. But the moment you start
changing the video&mdash;effects, transitions, color correction,
CGI&mdash;it has to be recompressed. Just as happened in the analog world when
dubbing tapes from copies of copies, generation loss is a palpable
problem. The cardinal rule, then, is to minimize further compression
passes on your footage. If your system is properly managed, you can
usually get away with only one additional compression pass; the one that
you do on final authoring of the project for its delivery format.
</p><p>
You also will need to look to your filesystem. Simply put, video takes a
lot of space, and it requires a high level of disk throughput and processing
power. The faster your filesystem, the better the performance in your
pipeline will be, and the fewer dropped frames you'll have. At the time
of this writing, XFS is the fastest for this type of work, although the
next generation of ReiserFS promises to give it a run for its money.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238cd40"></a>
Editing&mdash;Kino, Cuisine, Cinelerra, Diva, Blender, MainActor</h2></div></div><p>
Once imported, you'll need to edit your footage. Take heed: there's
more to editing than simply setting clips in order. The editing process
involves timing decisions and asset management (footage selection, logging
and commenting). All these are essential if you want to have a workable setup
and tell a coherent story. There's nothing worse than being caught in the
middle of a project and not being able to find that one particular shot
that'll make or break the scene. Your footage organization (which can
be as simple as a well-ordered directory structure) should be obvious,
scalable and flexible. It'll need to grow with you, so put a bit of
thought into how you want it set up at the outset.
</p><p>
The choice of editor is going to be determined both by the format of
the footage you're working with, and by the way you structure your
work. Stability, performance, interface and interoperability all need
to be weighed.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, the Linux editing field is in a state of
dramatic upheaval, caused in no small part by Google's Summer of Code. By
funding the FFmpeg/Blender integration project and the gstreamer-based
Diva, they've put major cracks in a dam already fixing to burst. By
the time of publication or soon thereafter, there should be five viable
FLOSS choices for editing platforms: Kino, Cuisine, Cinelerra, Diva and
Blender (Table 1). Of course, if you're really wanting a commercial solution for
less than $2,500 US/seat, there is always MainActor, a program that amazes all
who use it with its continued success as the Ford Edsel of video editors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8589t1.large.jpg"><img src="8589t1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Table 1. Editing Platforms
</p></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, Diva looks promising, but isn't releasing
proper packages yet; Blender is in the midst of a major development cycle
to
bring its editor up to par; Cinelerra is incredibly full-featured but
barely usable, due to serious interface design and stability problems
(any program that proudly lists, in its version 2.0 changelog, &ldquo;Fewer
lockups when resizing video window&rdquo; does not make it into my toolbox).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238d160"></a>
3-D Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)&mdash;Blender, The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
In our imaginary Alien Wedding Guest project, we're going to need
some fairly sophisticated CGI: a spaceship hovering in the background
and an alien being of some sort sitting in the audience or standing
off to one side seems a bare minimum. Constructing these objects in
3-D space (modeling), adding color and bumps (texturing), animating
their movement, and rendering out a finished video for blending with
the original wedding footage covers the basic 3-D pipeline, as can be
seen in our initial flowchart.
</p><p>
There are a variety of FLOSS 3-D programs available for Linux, most of
them highly capable, and most of them require a good amount of scripting
to get working in a pipeline. One program stands out far and away from
the pack in features, interoperability and usability: Blender.
</p><p>
Where programs like POV-Ray are essentially renderers that depend on
scripts or external programs for their grist, Blender is an end-to-end
3-D solution that plays nicely with a variety of renderers and file
formats. In terms of capabilities, Blender aims to be an open-source Maya,
and in the last 18 months, it has made amazing strides to that end with
no sign of slowing down.
</p><p>
One of its most significant assets is its user base. Among the video and
graphics applications available for Linux, it stands alone&mdash;far beyond
even The GIMP&mdash;in the energy and vitality of its community. Tutorials
and helpful forums abound, making its professionally oriented interface
quickly accessible for all the basic tasks involved in small projects.
</p><p>
The GIMP also plays an indispensable role in the 3-D process as a texture
creation system. Creating bump, reflection, specular and dirt maps
from photos or painting texture layers from whole cloth, there isn't
anything on Linux that even comes close in terms of versatility and
raw power. What's more, by the time this article is published, GIMP
modifications should update Blender textures in real time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238d3c8"></a>
Motion Tracking&mdash;Voodoo</h2></div></div><p>
Motion tracking is matching the movement of computer-generated elements
to your real-world footage. It's also used for stabilizing shaky handheld
video. A number of motion trackers have come and gone for Linux, and until
an open-source solution is developed, this will likely remain the case,
as university research projects are bought up by commercial interests
for development and sale to movie studios. At the moment, the best and
only player on the field is Voodoo, put out by Digilab at the University
of Hanover. It has the added advantage of outputting tracking data to
a Blender-readable script. In practice, the export leaves a lot to be
desired, but fortunately Ian Gowen has written a conversion utility that
translates Voodoo's clumsy export into a very clean script for Blender
(<a href="http://www.blenderwars.com/downloads/voodoo_convert.py" target="_self">www.blenderwars.com/downloads/voodoo_convert.py</a>).
</p><p>
Voodoo is not a perfect solution; it seems particularly to confuse slow
zooms and slow rotation, but despite its minor defects, it's still a
capable little program that's fairly well documented and licensed for
free use by all. I don't doubt that sometime in the future it will be
commercialized, but until then we have it to do with as we please (alas,
we cannot have the source code).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238d580"></a>
Color Correction and Compositing&mdash;Jahshaka, Cinelerra, Blender,
ImageMagick, CinePaint Glasgow, Mattelab</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've edited your footage, nailed your CG and tracked your
camera, the time comes to marry them all together. Unfortunately, this
is where we hit the major hole in the pipeline. There is, simply put,
no straightforward way to do compositing on Linux in any straightforward
sense. A well-outfitted, if basic, compositing system would provide
for HSV adjustment, level calls, histograms, curve adjustments
and brightness/contrast controls for color correcting the footage. A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> competent system also supplies rotosplines
for animated masking and two or three different keyers operating in different color spaces
(essential if you want to do blue screen work with MiniDV). Finally,
any compositor needs to do multilayer overlays, and do them well.
</p><p>
Our Alien Wedding Guest certainly requires this; sitting an alien in a
chair with his spaceship hovering in the blue sky behind a tree requires
taking rendered 3-D animation footage of the alien and his ship, using
rotosplines to create a foreground mask for the chairs in front of the
alien, and using the color keyer to treat the blue sky as a blue screen,
laying the spaceship in behind the tree. You then apply color adjustments
to each layer so that they all blend together nicely.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8589t2.large.jpg"><img src="8589t2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Table 2. Compositing Tools
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, it's possible to cobble together a more-or-less full
suite using the various tools, but it's not a pretty sight. However,
this is changing.
</p><p>
Blender is slated for a full-compositing system implementation for
Project Orange, which requires Blender to become a full-fledged high
bit-depth editing and compositing system; but that isn't due until
February 2006 or so. Jahshaka is introducing color keying and splines into
its RC2 release, in the fall of 2005/winter of 2006. CinePaint Glasgow's
first release is scheduled for December 2005. And MatteLab may soon be
extended and developed into a CinePaint or Blender plugin, as well as
getting even better keying features.
</p><p>
All of these projects display great promise, and some of them will bear
fruit this year, but at the moment, there just ain't no way
to pull this off without doing a fair bit of coding, linking GIMP with
ImageMagick with FFmpeg and working mostly through the command line. This
approach is extremely powerful, but it's far from ideal for the hobbyist.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238d9f8"></a>
Titling&mdash;Jahshaka, Kino, Blender</h2></div></div><p>
Titling, from the simple to the complex&mdash;anything from a quick
fade-in/fade-out in Helvetica to a complicated short film of
a title sequence&mdash;is the final step in the video part of our
pipeline. Complicated title sequences of the sort seen in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SE7EN</em></span> are
technically the domain of motion graphics software rather than simple
titling programs.
</p><p>
If you want to deal with complicated motion graphics without going all
the way and just creating your title sequences in Blender (which can be
fun, but is rather like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer), Jahshaka
is pretty much where it's at.
</p><p>
If simple fade-in/fade-out titles with dropped shadows are more your
fort&eacute;, you'll be perfectly happy dealing with Kino's DV Titler
plugin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x238dc08"></a>
Mixdown and Multiplexing</h2></div></div><p>
Once your effects are all done, and you've gotten your soundtrack mixed
and timed the way you want, it's time to mixdown to the tracks that you'll
marry back to your video stream. Assuming that you're going back to DV,
it'll need to be a stereo mixdown (as indeed one audio track should
be even if you're going to a surround-mixed DVD for final output),
which can then just be dubbed back in your editor of choice. Once
your mixdown is done, you're ready to marry the audio back to the video
(multiplexing). This is accomplished in your video editor by lining the
track up with the video and overdubbing the original audio.
</p><p>
Full discussion of the sound tools available for Linux can be found in the
excellent articles by Dave Phillips in past issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (there
are far too many to enumerate here, but a search at the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
Web site will yield good results). For our purposes here, remember that
close attention needs to be paid to preserving sound sync. Make sure
that your finishing dialog track is timed the same way your source track
was, and you'll be most of the way there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x2786068"></a>
Mastering</h2></div></div><p>
Using your editing program, print the video back to the format that will
result in the fewest possible compression passes. If your originating
medium was DV and you've done everything properly to this point, that
should mean you have a total of one recompression on your footage and
you can go out to a DV deck with little noticeable generation loss. Even
better, take your multiplexed file and back it up, un-recompressed,
to a tape or optical backup system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x2786170"></a>
Authoring&mdash;QDVDAuthor</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've multiplexed, you can use QDVDAuthor (see my article in the
December 2005 issue)
to author a well-tricked-out DVD for delivery to your friends and/or
customers. Or, you can use one of the variety of front ends for mencoder,
mjpegtools, or FFmpeg to compress your video for Web delivery or storage
on your home machine. Kino includes such a front end, and other good
ones include kencoder, konverter and Gmencoder. Whether to DVD or VHS
or for Web delivery, this is the end point of the pipeline.
</p><p>
So, in short, it is now possible, with a little work, to get a competent
and usable end-to-end video production studio working in your home or
business, running solely on Linux. The few holes left in the pipeline,
particularly in the compositing arena, are quickly being filled in
and should be in much better shape by mid-year. We're on the cusp of a
breakout year in the media creation field.
</p><p>
During the next few months, I'll be focusing specifically on potential
problems in this pipeline, and keep you updated on new developments in
both hardware and software. Take heart, fellow producer. There is now
a video-production oasis in the open-source desert.

Acquisition Means and Formats
</b></p><p>
Linux's video pipeline can handle just about anything you throw at it,
although some formats will limit your choice of editing software. The
available formats include, but are not limited to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Standard Definition:
DV25 (MiniDV and Digital8): the most popular consumer and prosumer
format both for its convenience and the quality of its image in the
higher-end cameras; its compression makes some compositing work, such
as color keying, problematic (though not impossible). MiniDV is captured
through the 1394 port.
</p></li><li><p>
Beta/Digibeta: common in broadcast, rare everywhere else, this format is
the granddaddy of TV video. Beta is captured through an analog tuner
card (V4L-compliant with 720x540 capture capability), DigiBeta comes
in through SDI and requires specialized capture hardware for optimal
signal preservation.
</p></li><li><p>
VHS and derivatives: analog consumer mediums, lower resolution than
MiniDV, must be captured through a V4L-compliant tuner card.
</p></li><li><p>
High Definition (HDV): this is the new consumer hi-def format being sold by Sony and
JVC on some of their prosumer cameras. They record to MiniDV tape
a highly compressed MPEG-2 signal having roughly the same bitrate as
standard-definition DV25. It captures over 1394 or USB 2.0. At this
point, it is unclear whether this format will be very useful or have
any meaningful advantage over progressive-scan SD miniDV.
</p></li><li><p>
Hi-Def: the CineAlta and other high-end motion picture cameras are
Hi-Def platforms. Capture is accomplished through Hi-Def capture cards
of various sorts, available through Linux Media Arts (<a href="http://lmahd.com" target="_self">lmahd.com</a>) and Specsoft. This
format requires special high-speed disk arrays and capture software,
both of which are available through Specsoft. Look out though&mdash;the
price on the cameras begins at $50K for the cheapies.
</p></li><li><p>
Film:
8, 16, 35 and 70mm and all their various incarnations. The old-fashioned
chemical emulsion is expensive, but can't be beat for charm and (in some
cases) for look.
Film can be brought into Linux in one of three ways:
1) Telecine: projecting a film for recording by a video camera, after which
capture proceeds according to the dictates of the video format.
2) Home-brew film scanning: using a DigitalSLR, the film is recorded frame
by frame. Some creative electronics work can automate the process. Time
consuming, but it does give you 10-bit or better color depth.
3) Professional film scanning: done with very large machines, at very high
prices, in very large buildings, which are usually located quite a long
way away.
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2294580.0x27869b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

A Few Thoughts on Sound
</b></p><p>
A video pipeline deals with a particular sort of software, but it's
not the whole story when it comes to media production. The process of
sound design for video is at least as involved as the video side of
the equation.
</p><p>
In brief, you'll need a sound effects editor, a synthesizer, a mixer, a
recorder and a scoring program. I've found the greatest productivity out
of the fewest number of programs using Audacity, Ardour and Rosegarden
in tandem, while keeping a handful of synths (like TerminatorX) around
for use in a pinch. The process of sound production for a video or motion
picture is a story in itself that deserves telling, but not today. In
the meantime, a full discussion of the sound tools available for Linux
can be found in the excellent article by Dave Phillips in past issues
of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (the September 2004 issue has a good technical overview
of many contenders, and the September 2005 issue has an extensive article
on Rosegarden).

Open-Source Blue Screening

Of special note in the open-source
compositing field is the newcomer MatteLab
(<a href="http://www.nccn.net/~w_rosky/evan/evan/programs/mattelab/index.html" target="_self">www.nccn.net/~w_rosky/evan/evan/programs/mattelab/index.html</a>), a
Java-based one-task utility that is very nicely designed and written by
16-year-old high-school student Evan Rosky. Although, at the moment, it does
not support multipass keying, it is the best keyer I've yet seen in the
open-source space on Linux. Outputting as it does to transparency-enabled
PNGs, it allows for multiple instances of single passes to be run on the
footage without quality loss, and when used in conjunction with Blender
or Jahshaka for compositing, it is a very powerful tool indeed.
