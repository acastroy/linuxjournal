Windows gaming on Linux has its ups and (mostly) downs, but
there are viable options for some games.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c93580.0x1d8b3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More than 300 games are available for Linux today. However,
plenty more are out there that are available only to Windows users,
and if there's one thing Linux users don't like to accept, it's that we
cannot do something everyone else can do. To that extent, a
number of products and projects exist that make it possible to play
Windows games under Linux (and to run other Windows programs as well). A
quick list of these options include the WINE Project, Win4Lin, CrossOver
Office, TransGaming's Cedega, VMware and the simple fact that some
games, such as many of those from Id Software (creator of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DOOM</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>
and so on) actually have binaries available that let you run the game
natively under Linux.
</p><p>
Let's take a look at each of these options, see how it fits into the big
picture and how likely it is to run the types of games you like,
keeping in mind that sometimes the games you'll be able to use are
older games rather than newer ones.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c93580.0x1d8b5b0"></a>
WINE&mdash;The Free Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The WINE Project's software (see the on-line Resources) allows people to run MS-DOS
and 32-bit Windows applications under Linux and the free BSDs. Whether
WINE will run your particular game is heavily dependent on a number of
factors. Because this is free software, your best bet is simply to give it
a try and see if it works. Depending on which Linux distribution you're
using, WINE may be difficult or simple to install. You may find that WINE
is bundled in your distribution's core or external package repositories.
</p><p>
Those who don't have this option can go to the WINE site and click the
Download button. You may find a prebuilt package for your distribution
there. If there isn't a package available, follow one of the WINE
Source Downloads links and then follow the instructions in the README
file for how to build this program.
</p><p>
Once you have WINE installed, attempting to run a Windows program using
this tool is actually not that difficult. First you need to get the
program onto your system, whether by mounting the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
containing it, or by downloading or copying the software onto your
machine. Then, if this is software you need to install, you need to determine
which program launches the installation&mdash;this is typically INSTALL.EXE
or SETUP.EXE. From inside the directory where the program lives, type
<tt  >wine <i>program</i></tt>. For example,
<tt  >wine INSTALL.EXE</tt>.
</p><p>
More often than not, the installation program will launch properly. You
might even be able to install the software fully using WINE. If
that's the case, don't get too excited yet. The real test is whether
the software will run. Programs installed inside of WINE are placed in
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/. You also may have launcher icons on
your desktop. If you're starting the program by hand, navigate to
the directory containing the program, and then type <tt  >wine
<i>program</i></tt> just
as you did before. So, if you were trying to see if you could get the
game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span> running, you might change to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program
Files/PopCap Games/Bejeweled, and type <tt  >wine
WinBej.exe</tt>. This is the moment
of truth. It either will run or it won't. If it does, rejoice! If not,
you can search the Web for tips on how to get the particular game running
under WINE, or you can try another tool.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I've had very poor luck getting games to run under WINE,
personally&mdash;much of that is due to a refusal to spend four days hunting
down every possible configuration tweak. I'm sure someone will take
away my official Geek card for that. Frankly, I have better things
to do. The closest I got this time was pulling out my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Classic Text
Adventure Masterpieces</em></span> CD with old Infocom games. The installer worked,
and the games would launch, but then they died. Ah well, it was a bit
of nostalgia anyway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c93580.0x1d8bad8"></a>
Win4Lin&mdash;Running Windows inside Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Win4Lin
is a commercial product (see Resources), and this section focuses on
Win4Lin Pro, which allows you to install Windows
2000 or XP inside a Win4Lin framework, which is installed on a Linux
system. Essentially, it lets you run a Windows machine inside a Linux
machine. Although this product is meant primarily as a business tool, if
you have it for &ldquo;practical&rdquo; purposes, then why not try using it to
run games that you can't get to run in another way? Because this is a
commercial tool with plenty of documentation, installation instructions
and starting Win4Lin are left to the manuals.
</p><p>
Now, first off, on an older machine like an Athlon 1.2GHz with 1GB of RAM,
don't even bother. The virtual Windows XP box functions at a snail's
pace for just about any operation, even opening folders. Playing any
games except for untimed casual ones (for example,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span>, which did
work for me) is essentially impossible due to the performance hit&mdash;though
you get this hit only inside the Win4Lin session, the rest of the machine
functions normally. Mind you, one of the older games I always test under
emulators, because I kind of miss it, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimTower</em></span>, and this is the first
time I've gotten it to run. However, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span> couldn't start
its install, because the installation program gave an error claiming it
couldn't find a data file.
</p><p>
Note that to get <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span> to work, I had to copy the files off of the
CD-ROM and install straight from my hard drive. The CD is both a data
and music CD, and both Linux and Windows seem to get fussy with it from
time to time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8630f1.large.jpg"><img src="8630f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c93580.0x1d8c058"></a>
CrossOver Office</h2></div></div><p>
CrossOver Office is, again, a commercial product designed for running
&ldquo;serious&rdquo; Windows programs, but that doesn't mean you can't use
this software at least to attempt to play games. CrossOver Office is
available from the CodeWeaver's Web site (see Resources), and once you have it installed,
you can convince it to try installing any Windows program that isn't
on its list by launching its Install Windows Software tool and clicking
the Install unsupported software button.
</p><p>
As with the others, don't get too excited if you can get a game
installed. That doesn't mean it will run. For example, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span> does manage to install under CrossOver Office&mdash;mind you, the text on
the installer's buttons is almost too tiny to read&mdash;but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimTower</em></span>'s
installer malfunctioned and wouldn't work. I found an old
<span   class="emphasis"><em>RISK</em></span> CD lying
around and discovered to my amusement that it refused to install because
it works only under Windows 95.
</p><p>
In fact, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span>'s opening movie plays under CrossOver Office as
well, and the game starts and is able to start downloading patches.
Although
it crashed at this point, frankly I found it impressive that the software
even got that far. That encouraged me to pull out something older. I
tried <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Sims</em></span> but that made the CrossOver Office installer decide that it
suddenly couldn't access the hard drive. <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity
2000</em></span> not only installed,
but actually plays, albeit a bit slowly on this system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8630f2.large.jpg"><img src="8630f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

VMware</h2></div></div><p>
Due primarily to the expense (VMware Workstation costs nearly $200 US),
most people who use VMware are doing so for work-related reasons. However, again,
if you have this virtual machine tool lying around, and your computer is
powerful enough to run a VMware session quickly enough to play mainstream
games inside without problems, then this is another avenue to explore. On
the same machine in which Win4Lin with Windows XP crawled, Windows XP
under VMware runs at perhaps twice the speed.
</p><p>
VMware so far is the only one out of the bunch that was able to
launch the installer for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Sims</em></span>. Not only could VMware install it,
it could actually run the game.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8630f3.large.jpg"><img src="8630f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. <span  class="emphasis"><em>The Sims</em></span>, being played within Windows XP in VMware 5.
</p></div></div><p>
Then I figured it was time for the big test, <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span>. First I
had to allocate more hard drive space to my VMware session, which involved
figuring out how to get Windows XP to see and use the new drive (a process
I did not find intuitive at all, not being a Windows XP user aside from
the occasional screenshot). Once the installation was complete, I tried to
launch <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span> and was told that 3-D support couldn't be started,
so I finally got around to installing the VMware Tools package, which
is supposed to&mdash;among other things&mdash;improve graphics
performance. Although
some might claim that VMware doesn't support Accelerated 3D, this is
actually no longer true. However, that support is
&ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, but
it doesn't get much more experimental than this, so it's worth trying.
</p><p>
To turn on Accelerated 3D, it's important first to shut down the virtual
machine. Once this is done, it's time to edit the .vmx file for the
instance. The VMware documentation recommends adding the following three
lines to the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mks.enable3d = TRUE
svga.vramSize = 67108864
vmmouse.present = FALSE
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this file is saved and closed, go to the VMware window and select
Edit&rarr;Preferences. In the Preferences dialog box, choose the Input
tab, and click the Ungrab when cursor leaves window check box to remove
the check mark. Doing so will make sure that your games don't run into
confusion over the mouse pointer. Click OK to save the setting. With
this done, it's time to bring the machine back up and try <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span> again. The game detects the &ldquo;hardware
change&rdquo; and offers to
reload default settings. Unfortunately, it's not enough, though at least
this time there was an obvious attempt to start the game.
</p><p>
Hoping that an update of the rarely used XP session will help, I
submit myself to the ritual of update, reboot, update, reboot and so
on. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. Too bad&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span> gets
tantalizingly close to starting.
</p><p>
Now, can VMware use the half-and-half CD with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span>? Yes and no. It
recognizes that both parts exist and allows accessing the files, but it
can't actually run the installer and doesn't seem aware of all of the
files on the CD. The game does install and run though from files copied
off of the CD and onto the hard drive earlier.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span> will not run
in hardware-accelerated mode either, so the experimental feature isn't
quite there yet. Still, as it improves, the chance of being able to use
VMware for higher-end Windows games does too. Hopefully by that point,
however, there will be more mainstream games available for Linux natively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c93580.0x1d837b0"></a>
TransGaming</h2></div></div><p>
I've saved the most appropriate choice for last among the Windows-gaming
options, so this section can end on an upbeat note. TransGaming's Cedega
product (see Resources) is essentially a
subscription service where you pay a monthly fee for access to the
latest versions of the program in binary form, the ability to vote on
the games that you would like to see prioritized and more. Because this
product focuses on games and implementing the DirectX APIs and other
Windows features heavily used by game programmers, the likelihood of a
Windows game working under Cedega should be better than under the other
options. However, it is not guaranteed.
</p><p>
I'll give the Point2Play interface a shot even though I tend to have
hit-and-miss luck with it. On Fedora Core 4, my CD drive shows up
as /media/cdrecorder, and even when a disk is mounted onto the system,
Point2Play can't see it&mdash;even though running the built-in Point2Play tests
says that my CD drive is fine. A quick <tt  >ln -s /media/recorder
/mnt/cdrom</tt>
fixed that problem. However, the Install button still doesn't become
visible, so I gave up. There's no other fixes listed in the documentation
that I haven't already tried.
</p><p>
There's no Cedega to install the program directly without bothering
with the extra GUI. To do so, I mount the CD (in this case, the first
CD-ROM for <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span>) and change to its base directory. Then
I type <tt  >cedega Installer.exe</tt> and immediately get hit with a stream of
errors. Going to the TransGaming Forums and running keyword searches
doesn't help, so I post a query; we'll see what comes of that. I had
<span   class="emphasis"><em>World
of Warcraft</em></span> working under Cedega and Fedora Core 3 so I know it's doable.
</p><p>
Instead, I'll try <span   class="emphasis"><em>Diablo II</em></span>. Point2Play still won't
see the CD, so I go
to /media/cdrecorder and type <tt  >cedega install.exe</tt> to launch the installer,
and it launches just fine. When it gets to the video tests, it recommends
Direct3D: DirectDraw HAL, so it does pick up the 3-D functionality on
the system. The game also launches fine, though if I run it in windowed
mode, I can't click on any other windows or it crashes. Again, none of
the potential fixes I find on the boards helps with this.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
There is no perfect solution for playing Windows games under Linux. The
best solution is to look and see whether a Linux binary is provided for
the game, or to go find games that are written to play under Linux. Id
Software and Epic Games both release Linux binaries for their games. Keep
in mind that if you opt to use a solution such as Win4Lin or VMware,
you have to own a valid copy of the Windows version you intend to
use. Solutions such as WINE, CrossOver Office and Cedega implement the
APIs without requiring the operating system to be installed.
</p><p>
Still, as you can see, there are many options if you are really determined
to play a Windows game in Linux without having to dual-boot.
