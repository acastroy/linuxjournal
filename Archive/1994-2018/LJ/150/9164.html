No question.  Your taste in music is certainly among the best.  Why not share the tracks that make your heart sing with others?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffd580.0x20f53a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is certainly a fascinating collection of music, Fran&ccedil;ois! I hadn't
realized you were such a big fan of the Indie music scene.  You've
got some great tunes queued up in Amarok, and there's plenty here that
I've never even heard of.  You should let me know about it, so I can check
out some of it myself.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> No, Fran&ccedil;ois, I don't want you to e-mail me your current
playlist.  There are other, more interesting ways to do this now.  Sharing
your musical taste with others is becoming quite popular, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>.  People have &ldquo;now playing&rdquo; or &ldquo;recently
played&rdquo; lists
in their blogs, and music discussion is a staple of social networking
sites all over the Web.  Furthermore, you already are running some great
Linux software that will let you share your musical tastes with one,
two, five or a thousand people, if you so desire.  Of course, I will
show you, but for now, we must get ready.  As you can see, our guests
have already arrived.
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where we match the best in Linux
and open-source software with superb wines and, of course, the best of
clientele.  Please, find your tables and make yourselves comfortable
while my faithful waiter attends to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>vin</em></span>.  Fran&ccedil;ois, please
head down to the wine cellar.  I think the 2004 Village Latour Cotes du
Rossillon from Maison Chapoutier would make an excellent counterpoint
to today's menu.  Why not marry excellent musical taste with an excellent
and flavorful red wine? You'll find a few cases in the third row of the
south wing.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! Our guests must be parched.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois and I were discussing the joys of sharing music we enjoy with
friends (and anyone else who shares an interest for that matter).  Your
Linux system makes this easy with the right programs.  One way to share
your entertainment, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, is simply to tell the world.  Kopete,
the multiprotocol instant messaging client distributed with KDE, has
a neat little feature that lets you do just that.  Say you happen to be
logged in to an IRC channel or having a chat with a friend on-line, using
Jabber, Yahoo or some other service.  Typing <tt  >/media</tt> in the
chat field at the bottom of your chat window is all it takes.  The system
then
transmits a message telling your chat partners the artist,
title and album of whatever song you are listening to (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9164f1.large.jpg"><img src="9164f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.  With Kopete's Now Listening plugin, your favorite music player
can tell your friends what you are listening to.
</p></div></div><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned.  Excellent.  Please, pour for our guests.  I
envy you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>; you will truly enjoy this wine.
</p><p>
Sending your current track information via Kopete works with Amarok,
Kaffeine, Noatun and other KDE applications.  It also works well with
XMMS.  In order to get Kopete to transmit this information, however,
you may need to turn on the plugin that does the job.  To do this, click
on Settings in Kopete's menu bar and select Configure Plugins.  A window
pops up with a list of Kopete's available plugins in the left-hand sidebar
(Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9164f2.large.jpg"><img src="9164f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  Activating and Configuring Kopete's Now Listening Plugin
</p></div></div><p>
Make sure the Now Listening check box is checked.  Now, look over
on the right, and you'll see three tabs.  You can change the format of
the display to your instant messaging client if you don't happen to
like the current setting.  The interesting tab here is the one labeled
Advertising Mode.  The default requires that you enter
<tt  >/media</tt>
to transmit the information, but you can make it automatic here.  Another
setting transmits the Now Listening information in your on-line
status information.  When you are happy with the settings, click OK.
</p><p>
Of course, this is only text information, and no one but yourself can hear
what you are listening to.  To get the sound out to others, you need to
do a little broadcasting.  A common scenario for a lot of people at home
is having a huge collection of music on one PC but two or more
computers in other parts of the house.  Wouldn't it be great to be able
to play music on one PC and have it broadcasted on the other computers,
wherever they might be in the house? Becoming a local broadcaster on your
network is easier than you might think.  In fact, you may have
a few programs that do the job nicely already installed on your system.
</p><p>
One of these is Jrgen Kofler and Christophe Thommeret's Kaffeine,
a popular KDE media player.  Kaffeine is generally thought of as a video
player, but it also can serve up DVDs, VCDs, audio CDs or a variety
of multimedia files stored on your system.  Some Linux distributions
that include the Kaffeine player also embed it in Konqueror for viewing
on-line videos in Web pages.  Kaffeine also has a broadcast
feature.  Click File on Kaffeine's menu bar, then navigate to Network
Broadcasting, and select Send Broadcast Stream (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9164f3.large.jpg"><img src="9164f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  It's easy to turn Kaffeine into a broadcasting media player.
</p></div></div><p>
A small window appears asking you to select a port number.  By default,
the port already is selected as 8080, but you can override
it here.  Click OK to close the dialog, and you are ready to broadcast.  In
fact, anything you play, whether it is a music track or a video, is now
being broadcast.  Other people on your network who want to pick up this
broadcast need to fire up their own copy of Kaffeine and do a slight
change to their configuration.  Click File on the menu bar and head to
the Network Broadcasting submenu, but this time, choose Receive Broadcast
Stream.  A configuration dialog appears (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9164f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  On the receiving end, you must tell Kaffeine which host is
doing the broadcasting.
</p></div></div><p>
Enter the sender's IP address, the port on which the sender is transmitting
(the one you set up in the Kaffeine program doing the broadcasting),
and click OK.  Just like that, you are watching (or listening) to whatever
the local DJ or VJ in your home is sending out.
</p><p>
Several &ldquo;organic&rdquo; music services have appeared on-line recently
as part of the whole Web 2.0 mania.  Some of them, I confess, are quite
fascinating.  My favorites to date are Pandora and Last.fm.  Pandora is
an interesting service that suggests, and plays, musical selections
based on songs you tell it you enjoy.  It turns out that it is very
good at guessing what other music you will like.  Pandora is great,
but it's a solitary experience.  What sets Last.fm apart is the social
networking aspect.  You can discuss music with friends, blog about your
favorite tracks, discover new music and find out what your friends are
listening to.  And, of course, you can tell them what you are listening to
on your Linux system.  To get in on the fun, you first need
a Last.fm account.  Then, using a cool little piece of software called
Audioscrobbler, your favorite Linux music player can tell Last.fm what
you are listening to.  Audioscrobbler, by the way, is essentially a
database system that tracks listening habits and generates statistics
used to predict likes, dislikes and so on.
</p><p>
In the December 2005 issue, I told you about the incredibly amazing
Amarok, the KDE
jukebox music player.  This program is a must-have for music lovers and
remains my favorite media player.  Amarok's features are too numerous
to list here, but let me give you a recap.  There's a powerful cover manager
(downloads covers from Amazon), a context browser that keeps track of your
favorite and most-listened-to songs, a skinnable interface, iPod support
(other players work as well), great visualization tools (using libvisual)
and more.  There's even a lyric download feature so you can sing along
with your favorite tunes without worrying about whether you are getting
the words right.  Now, the latest version of the amazing Amarok
also features Last.fm support with built-in Audioscrobbler support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffd580.0x20f63c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
You can check out Marcel's article on Amarok
by visiting the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site at
<a href="../140/8558.html" target="_self">/article/8558</a>.
</p></div><p>
To use Amarok with Last.fm, click Settings on the menu bar and select
Configure Amarok.  The configuration window appears (Figure 5) with
various categories listed in the left-hand sidebar.  One of these is for
the Last.fm service, courtesy of the Audioscrobbler program.  Enter your
Last.fm user name and password, then click OK.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9164f5.large.jpg"><img src="9164f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5.  The latest Amarok allows you to broadcast your musical tastes via Last.fm.
</p></div></div><p>
On the GNOME side of things, there also has been some recognition of
Last.fm's popularity with music lovers.  That's reflected in the excellent
Banshee music player.  To start telling the
world what you are listening to with Banshee, click Edit on the menu bar,
and select Plugins.  The Banshee plugins configuration window appears
with the Audioscrobbler plugin selected.  Click the Configuration tab
(Figure 6).
Click the check box that reads Enable song reporting, enter your user
name and password, then click Close.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9164f6.large.jpg"><img src="9164f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Audioscrobbler plugins are available in the downloads section of Last.fm
for XMMS, Noatun and other Linux players.
</p></div><p>
Whether you choose to use Amarok or Banshee (or something else), the
information regarding your musical tracks will now be transmitted to the
Last.fm community and people can find out what you are listening to.  Earlier
on, I mentioned that people could listen to what you are playing as
well, and that also is something you can do at Last.fm.  Alas, to become a
Last.fm DJ, you need to subscribe to the service.  To take this service
out for a spin, I spent my $3 US and added a personal radio station
to my wftl account.  With the paid account, your friends can tune in to
your radio station using the free, GPLed, Linux music player distributed
on the site (yes, versions are available for other operating systems).
</p><p>
To use the player, unpack the bundle into the directory of your
choice (<tt  >tar -xjvf LastfmLinux-1.1.4.tar.bz2</tt>).  There is
nothing to compile here, so running it is as easy as switching to the
directory into which you have extracted it and running the player
(<tt  >./player</tt>).  When you run the player the first time,
the setting dialog appears.  This is where you enter your Last.fm
account information.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9164f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7.  Configuring the Last.fm Media Player
</p></div></div><p>
Once all the information is entered, you are ready to go.  For your
friends or family to tune in to the songs you are playing, they need
to fire up their player by switching to the directory (or folder) and
running the program.  In addition to the player, a window labeled Radio
Control appears.  Before you can play a station, other than your own,
you need to create, or add, a radio station to the list on your personal
Last.fm page.  Once done, you can click the Personal Radio button, and
the player takes over, streaming whatever content is coming from
your media player, whether it is Amarok, Banshee or anything else that
uses Audioscrobbler.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9164f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8.  Last.fm's Freely Distributed Music Player
</p></div></div><p>
If you would prefer to use a player other than this one, you can do that
by clicking the settings button (the tool button on the lower right)
and making your choice there.  You also can specify a station by
entering its address (for example,
<tt  >lastfm://user/wftl/personal</tt>).
</p><p>
Time appears to be running out, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but I do want to direct
your attention momentarily back to Amarok.  Once you are part of the
Last.fm social network, you don't actually need to use the Last.fm
player.  Amarok can tune in directly to what Last.fm calls Neighbour
Radio.  As you play more and more songs, the site starts to create a
profile of your musical tastes, then adds neighbours, stations of
people whose musical tastes mirror your own.
</p><p>
On Amarok's menu bar, click Engage, then Play Last.fm Stream, then
select Neighbour Radio.  Even if you don't have any musical neighbours,
you also can choose to listen to Global Tag Radio, which plays music
based on the Last.fm community's collectively tagged music.  Each of these
stations is arranged according to genre, whether it be Rock, Pop, Dance,
Rap or whatever.  It's a great way to discover new music.
</p><p>
The clock on the wall, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, she is telling us that closing
time is upon us yet again.  The collection of music being played here
in the restaurant at your tables would make for a fascinating stream,
indeed.  I hear some excellent music&mdash;not surprising with a clientele
of such impeccable taste.  Fran&ccedil;ois, please refill our guests' glasses
a final time so that we may raise a toast.  Please raise your glasses,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
