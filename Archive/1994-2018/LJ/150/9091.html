Combine MisterHouse with Perl scripts, X10 and the Linux kernel to create
an automated zoned radiant heat system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I am an architect and a software consultant, I am building my own
home, and both my wife and I have allergies.  Forced-air environmental control
systems are not good for people with allergies.  I have chosen to use
radiant heating.  Environmental control systems are one of the areas of
home automation into which hobbyists rarely venture.  Although the control
systems for air conditioners and heat pumps are not particularly complex,
a poor control system can wear out an expensive compressor early, if it does not destroy it.  This taboo against directly controlling
environmental control systems hardware extends to systems that are
neither as easy to destroy nor as costly to replace.
</p><p>
This article
discusses
controlling a home radiant heating system using a home control
system running under Linux.  I have used several guiding principles in
designing and implementing this system.  I am a huge proponent of KISS
(Keep It Simple), and I am an underutilized software consultant from a
community that still believes pennies are money&mdash;I am cheap.  I think that
is a virtue.  Simple trumps complex, cheap prevails over costly, software
substitutes for hardware, do-it-yourself replaces buying or hiring.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef4450"></a>
Division into Zones</h2></div></div><p>
Radiant heating systems are not particularly complex.  My house is divided
into zones, and each zone has its own controls.  To some extent, the control
system for the zone interacts with controls for the whole system.  In
a radiant heating system, when a zone requests heat, water is heated and
circulated into something to radiate that heat into the rooms making up
that zone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef4558"></a>
System Components</h2></div></div><p>
The first system component is a heat source, and there is a wide variety of possible heating sources.  I
am using a 144,000 BTU wall-mounted instantaneous natural gas hot water
heater with a 95% efficiency rating.  One of the features of these units
is that they are regulated and controlled internally.  Simply drawing water
triggers the electronic ignition.  The unit itself controls its output to
match demand.  My unit has some ability to manipulate the preset water
temperature as well as monitor its performance.  Regardless of whether
it is conventionally controlled or controlled by a home automation
system,
my water heater itself requires no external controls.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9091f1.large.jpg"><img src="9091f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.  Takagi TkJr 144K BTUH Hot Water Heater
</p></div></div><p>
The next component is a heat sink&mdash;the way heat gets from the distribution system into the
zone.  In my house, this is PEX tubing, approximately 16" on center inside a
concrete slab.  There are many other ways of getting heat from the water
into the zone, including baseboards, radiators and tubing stapled to the
underside of floors.  Each method has its own properties, but the most critical
of these is the amount of heat it can radiate into the zone.  PEX tubing
in a concrete slab is one of the more efficient means of transferring heat
to a zone.  The maximum radiated heat from a concrete floor with radiant
tubing is between 50&ndash;90K BTUH per 1,000 square feet or 50&ndash;90K BTUH for
1,000 square foot
of floor&mdash;depending on how warm a floor you are willing to tolerate.
</p><p>
Proper design of the heat source and sink are beyond the scope of this
article; however, they are not really complex.  The heat sink must be
capable of supplying more heat than the zone can lose in an hour under
the most extreme conditions.  The heat source must be able to provide
at least as much heat as all zones could demand under the most extreme
conditions.  Under cold but less than extreme conditions, I do not want
the system running most of the time; the norm is for the heat to run
about one-third of the time.  All heating systems are over-designed.
</p><p>
Another component is the circulator(s).  Water must be persuaded to flow through the system.  The
norm is that at least one pump or circulator is required.  Circulation
systems can be designed in a number of ways.  I have been able to
procure small circulators very cost effectively (cheaply), so I have used
a circulator for each zone.  This significantly simplifies many other
aspects of the design of the system.  It eliminates the need for zone
control solenoids and their controls.  It eliminates controls
for the circulator separate from those of the zone.  It makes providing a
zone-by-zone failsafe override easier, and it reduces the need to balance
the system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9091f2.large.jpg"><img src="9091f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  Radiant Distribution Manifold and Circulators
</p></div></div><p>
Another part of the system is a closed-loop water distribution system.  Hot water needs to get from
the heat source to the heat sink and back.  In my home, this is more PEX
tubing, as well as manually constructed manifolds.
</p><p>
Finally, there is the control system, and that is where Linux comes in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef4b88"></a>Premises</h2></div></div><p>
There must be a failsafe at least to keep the pipes from freezing should
the home automation system fail.  I have no provisions for dealing with
an extended loss of power during severely cold weather&mdash;very few modern
heating systems will work without power.  Even the failsafe will fail
absent another source of power to drive the circulators and ignite the
water heater in the event of a prolonged power failure.  A failsafe is
accomplished by wiring a traditional cheap thermostat in parallel with
the home control system on a sufficient number of dispersed zones to
maintain temperatures above freezing.
</p><p>
Feedback is more important than reliability&mdash;it is not important that
a zone starts heating at a specific instant.  It is important that over
the course of time, the zone temperature does not wander too far outside
the tolerance from the current setpoint for that zone.  That tolerance
is critical.  Expecting to maintain a temperature of exactly 70&deg;F
in a zone all the time is unrealistic.  Doing so would make the system turn on
and off constantly.  All environmental control systems have some tolerance
built in.  The primary difference in my system is that both the setpoint and
the tolerance are controllable.  Feedback is important in that it allowed
me to use an extremely inexpensive means of controlling AC power: X10
appliance modules.
</p><p>
X10 is fairly ubiquitous.  It is readily available
and cheap.  In a lot of installations, it is highly reliable, but some are
highly troublesome.  Feedback is also important because if all else fails,
my heating system needs to attract my attention to solve the problem.
</p><p>
The controls and sensors need to be cost-effective devices easily
interfaced to and managed by the home control computer&mdash;did I mention
that I am cheap?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef4d98"></a>
The Control System</h2></div></div><p>
The X10 appliance modules to turn on and off AC power to the AC devices
(circulators) that are being controlled are Dallas Semiconductor DS1820
1-Wire temperature sensors.  These are extremely inexpensive and are
an
easily interfaced means to sense temperatures.  Each zone may have
one or more temperature sensors.  Eventually, I intend to place sensors
at different heights within the zones to explore the radiant heating
premise that rooms with warm floors are perceived as warmer even if
the room temperature higher up is cooler.  Furthermore, I monitor the supply
and return temperatures for each zone.  This provides feedback, and it
provides a means of monitoring system performance.  The heat supplied to
each zone is the differential between the supply and return temperature,
the flow rate and the cycle time.  The flow rate for the circulators is
approximately constant, and all other factors can be monitored.  This
means the output and performance can
be monitored in real time.
</p><p>
Finally, there is a need to determine human input&mdash;I need to be able to
demand that my living room be hotter or colder.  This is done in a number
of ways.
</p><p>
For my first heating season, a single $10 US thermostat was used to turn
on all
circulators for all zones concurrently.  At initial startup, the hot water
heater started about a minute after the circulators and ran for about
17 hours straight.  I was starting to panic, wondering how large a loan I
would need to afford heat.  Then it stopped.  After that it became a game trying to
catch the system running the rest of the winter.  Once each zone was up
to temperature, they very rarely ran.
</p><p>
During the second season, I used a simple MisterHouse Perl
script.  Changing a zone's setpoint involved simple changes to that Perl
script.  It worked, but it was not a human-friendly user interface.
</p><p>
Ordinary thermostats can be installed and connected to digital
inputs.  There are numerous ways to do this, and there are relatively
cheap 1-Wire digital input sensors.  The thermostats are not used to
set the temperature; they are used as inputs to determine whether I
want the temperature altered.  I use these primarily because all users,
regardless of their competence with computers, tend to be comfortable
with and understand them, which is important in a guest room.  However,
because they are inputs to the control system, they constitute requests,
not demands, and they are not a failsafe.
</p><p>
The user interface for the normal computer-savvy users (my wife and I) is
an evolving Web interface with status and alterable settings for each zone.  The
Web interface can be used from any computer on the home net, from
a wireless PDA supporting a Web browser or even from remote locations,
provided sufficient security precautions are taken.
</p><p>
Nothing about an environmental control system is particularly
time-sensitive.  I develop embedded and sometimes real-time
systems.  Environmental control is not real time.  This means the demands
of the control software on the Linux system are relatively low and not
particularly time-critical.  In fact, in my home, the heat source for the
radiant heat is shared by domestic hot water.  This has advantages and
disadvantages and is not permitted by some building codes.  When domestic
and heating demands exceed the capacity of the hot water heater, such
as when someone is taking a hot shower, domestic needs trump those
of heat.  It is unlikely I will notice if the heat delays a few minutes
before starting.  But if I am in the shower, I will notice if I am deprived
of hot water just so the heating cycle can start immediately.
</p><p>
The open-source MisterHouse Project provides a capable and highly
programmable home control system, with capabilities well beyond those
required for this project.  It runs on Linux and Windows and supports a
wide variety of controls, sensors and other hardware.  It provides a very
capable Web interface that I was able to extend easily to support my zone
controls.  And, it has features, such as floor plan integration, that I hope
to take advantage of later.  There already have been several environmental
control systems implemented using MisterHouse.  These have used expensive
computer-monitorable thermostats controlling traditional HVAC control
systems.  In my implementation, MisterHouse does all the heavy lifting.
</p><p>
MisterHouse is written in Perl and has provisions to allow MisterHouse
users to incorporate their own Perl routines easily, as well as an API
with functions and events targeted at home control.  It is fairly simple
to create a bit of Perl code and have it execute every minute,
every three minutes or only on Sundays when there is a full moon.  It is
easy to monitor or control 1-Wire and X10 devices&mdash;all the elements
needed to make a working system.
</p><p>
I love programming in Perl, because it
is easy, powerful and forgiving.  You do not need to be a Perl monk to
create custom scripts for MisterHouse.  The MisterHouse distribution and
Web site include numerous
examples, many of
which are only a few lines of fairly simple code.  A substantial amount
of home control can be accomplished with MisterHouse without doing any
programming at all.
</p><p>
I primarily used Debian Linux, and I created a Linux Vserver (lightweight
virtual server), specifically for
MisterHouse.  This is not strictly necessary, but it is cheaper and easier
than a dedicated machine, and it's simpler and cleaner than running a mess of
different d&aelig;mons on a single machine.  I highly recommend Vservers; they
make experimenting with configurations fun and easy.
</p><p>
MisterHouse can be installed under Debian with apt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install misterhouse
</pre>
</p><p>
It requires a collection of Perl modules, and these dependencies
should be taken care of by apt.
</p><p>
While planning this system, I decided on a computer X10 interface, the
ACT TI-103, specifically because the most common X10 interfaces, the CM17
and CM11, have been known to have issues.  The TI-103 sends a stronger than
normal X10 signal and can receive a weaker than spec X10 signal.
Furthermore,
it supports X10 extended addressing, allowing the use of more than 255 X10
devices in a single home.  Unfortunately, I mistakenly assumed that there
would be MisterHouse support for it.
</p><p>
For early development, I used an old
CM11 I had lying around, but eventually, I wrote a new MisterHouse driver
for the ACT TI-103 that is now part of the MisterHouse Project.  The ACT
TI-103 is a nice controller and was easy enough to talk to&mdash;with some
effort you can manipulate it directly using minicom as it uses ASCII
command strings.  Developing the TI-103 driver was more complex and time
consuming than the rest of my MisterHouse HVAC software.  So far, it has
not proven to be any more or less reliable than the CM11.  But, my TI-103
driver has been part of MisterHouse distributions since MisterHouse
1.102.  After I was well underway with this effort, Insteon came out
with a new series of power-line devices that are superior in many ways to
X10 devices.  However, they are still more expensive than X10 modules.  Neil
Cherry should have MisterHouse support for Insteon completed by the time
this article is published.
</p><p>
MisterHouse needs to be configured for the controllers and sensors.  The X10
controller is set by assigning the correct port, such as /dev/ttyS0,
to the correct X10 device in the MisterHouse configuration file
/etc/misterhouse/mh.ini:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cm11 = /dev/ttyS0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef5478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ti103 = /dev/ttyS0
</pre>
</p><p>
You may want to configure a number of other parameters, such
as latitude and longitude, that would make MisterHouse more useful, or
if you wanted to make heating decisions based on the weather report but
nothing else specific to heating control.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9091f3.large.jpg"><img src="9091f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  Radio Shack/X10 Appliance Module Controlling Circulator
</p></div></div><p>
X10 devices are set up in a separate configuration file, x10.mht.  The
parameters for each device are the type of X10 module, its address, name
and the groups to which it belongs.  I needed an entry for each appliance module
controlling the circulator for each zone.  An example entry would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
X10A, C1, Circulator1, All_Heat|Night_Setback
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef5898"></a></h2></div></div><p>
for an X10 appliance module
with a C house code and a 1-unit code named Circulator1 included
in the groups All_Heat and Night_Setback.  In a MisterHouse Perl script,
one way this can be turned on is with the code set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$Circulator1 'ON';
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1ef59f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and all Night_Setback devices can be turned off with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&amp;set_all($Night_Setback, 'OFF');

</pre>
</p><p>
If you have multiple X10 controllers, you may need to assign a controller
to the device.  And, it is very useful to assign labels and groups to
devices.  mht files are transformed into mhp (Perl code) files as part of MisterHouse
startup, or they can be reloaded on a running system through the
MisterHouse user interface.  Once X10 devices are correctly entered into
the .mht file and MisterHouse starts up, they can be controlled
manually by the UI, or they can be controlled programmatically via bits of Perl.  It
also is possible to add X10 devices to MisterHouse directly from the
MisterHouse Web interface.
</p><p>
MisterHouse supports a number of user interfaces, including a Tk interface
and Telnet.  But, the primary interface I use is the built-in MisterHouse
Web server.  By default, it should come configured to work and should be
on port 8080.  Using a Vserver made it easy to move it to the standard
http port 80.  Inside my home, browsing <a href="http://mh.dlasys.net" target="_self">mh.dlasys.net</a> brings up the MisterHouse main page.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9091f4.large.jpg"><img src="9091f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  DS1820 1-Wire Test Rig
</p></div></div><p>
I had several available alternatives for interfacing MisterHouse to 1-Wire.
MisterHouse can communicate directly with 1-Wire devices through a
1-Wire serial interface, and they are configured in an .mht file much
like X10 devices.  One of the machines I was planning on using did not
have sufficient serial ports for both the X10 controller and the 1-Wire
serial controller, so I opted for a 1-Wire USB controller.  MisterHouse
currently does not directly support the 1-Wire USB controller.  But there
are several Linux-specific means of using the 1-Wire USB controller.  The
Linux 2.6 kernel recently added support for a number of 1-Wire devices
and interfaces.  This is what I would have preferred to use.  Unfortunately,
at the time I was developing the code, it was very new and not well documented.
There is a 1-Wire filesystem that maps 1-Wire devices to a
filesystem.  digitemp, a standalone program for both Linux and Windows,
can read 1-Wire devices from both USB and serial interfaces, and that
is what I elected to use.
</p><p>
My first implementation had digitemp polling all the DS1820 temperature
sensors inside MisterHouse.  My current implementation has digitemp
polling the temperature sensors as an external cron job and recording the
information into an RRD database.  The following Perl script creates an RRD
database with entries for each DS1820 in the @sensor list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Category = HVAC
@sensor = ( "28E8E30500000083", "2853327C000000D4");

my $cmd = "rrdtool create temp.rrd --start N --step 60 ";
for $i ( 0 .. $#sensor) {
 $cmd .= "DS:$sensor[$i]:GAUGE:120:30:180 ";
}
$cmd .= "RRA:MIN:0.5:60:8760 ";
$cmd .= "RRA:MAX:0.5:60:8760 ";
$cmd .= "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:60:8760 ";
print "$cmd\n";
my $result = system($cmd);
</pre>
</p><p>
DS:$sensor[$i]
specifies the data source (each DS1820), 30:180 are the min and max
values
for the data source and GAUGE is a particular RRD data source appropriate for
temperature sensors.  There are three archives: a Min, Max and Average.
</p><p>
I live in the US, so all temperatures are in Fahrenheit; however, digitemp
can read and record either Centigrade or Fahrenheit values, and all other
values throughout the system are relative to those reported by digitemp.
</p><p>
Polling is accomplished with the following script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl
# Category = HVAC

@sensor = ( { sn =&gt; "28E8E30500000083", temp =&gt; 0 },
	    { sn =&gt; "2853327C000000D4", temp =&gt; 0 });

# Read the output from digitemp
open( DIGITEMP, "digitemp_DS2490 -c /etc/digitemp.conf \
 -a -q -o\"%s:%R:%.2F\" |" );
while( &lt;DIGITEMP&gt; ) {
 chomp;
 if( $_ =~ /^nanosleep/i ) {
  my $now = localtime;
 } else {
  my ($dvc,$sn,$temp) = split(/:/);
  print "dvc=$dvc sn=$sn temp=$temp\n";
  $temp = 185 unless ($temp);
  for $i ( 0 .. $#sensor) {
   if ($sn eq $sensor[$i]-&gt;{sn}) {
    $sensor[$i]-&gt;{temp} = $temp ;
   }
  }
 }
}
close( DIGITEMP );
my $cmd = "rrdtool update temp.rrd N:";
for $i ( 0 .. $#sensor) {
 $cmd .= ":$sensor[$i]-&gt;{temp}";
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1eec910"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This can be set up as a cron job with a crontab entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">

*/2 * * * * root test -c /opt/mh/local/bin/temp2rrd.pl \
 &amp;&amp; /opt/mh/local/bin/temp2rrd.pl &gt;/dev/null

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfc580.0x1eeca70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or it can be run periodically with MisterHouse.
</p><p>
I added a Perl routine to mh to query the RRD database periodically and
compare current temperatures for each zone with the setpoint for that
zone (specified in the mh UI code).  If the current temperature is too far
below the setpoint, the X10 module controlling the circulator for
that zone is turned on.  If the current temperature is too far above the
setpoint, the X10 module is turned off.  Right now, fault tolerance
is achieved by turning on/off the appropriate X10 module on each loop if
the current temperature is outside the acceptable differential from the
setpoint.  Eventually, the temperature sensors attached to the supply and
return for each zone will be used to verify whether a zone circulator
is running.  They also will be used to calculate the actual heat output
into each zone.
</p><p>
The RRD database keeps historical data, which might have a
number of uses.  Furthermore, RRD is designed specifically to record
periodically polled values.  It has configurable provisions to
validate data and to handle queries against
invalid data appropriately.
</p><p>
Perl is an object-oriented language, and MisterHouse takes advantage of
that.  Primarily, MisterHouse manages objects.  The display elements, as
well as programmed events and actions, all act on objects.  MisterHouse
already has a variety of interesting objects, but I needed something
equivalent to a heating zone, so I created an HVAC_Zone object using an
example object as a guide.  My HVAC_Zones have a setpoint and a
delta property.  The setpoint is the target temperature for the zone, and the delta
is the allowed deviation before taking action.  HVAC_Zone objects inherit
from the MisterHouse Generic_Item, so they appear in the UI under browse
groups as well as in a few other places.  Zones are created much like the X10
items described above.  They can be created in the same .mht file with
X10 items or in their own .mht file.  Other HVAC groups might be North,
Night and Vacation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9091f5.large.jpg"><img src="9091f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5.  Browsing the All_HVAC group containing a single master bedroom
zone&mdash;this shows a simple Web thermostat control to increase,
decrease or set the setpoint for each HVAC_Zone object.
</p></div></div><p>
An example entry would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HVAC_ZONE,    H1,   master_bedrm,  All_HVAC|Thermostats,     72,  2,
</pre>
</p><p>
This would create an HVAC_Zone object named master_bedrm in groups
All_HVAC and Thermostats, with a setpoint of 72 and a delta of +/&ndash;
2&deg;.  A few minor alterations to the MisterHouse Web server were
necessary to create a Web control that is displayed for each zone.  I
used the X10 Lamp item as a reference, as it already had a drop-down as
well as arrow buttons for relative changes.
</p><p>
Finally, I use a Perl script executed periodically by MisterHouse to
query the the current temperature of each DS1820 within each zone,
comparing it to the current setpoint/delta for that zone turning on
the appropriate X10 appliance module for that zone if the temperature
within the zone is more than the delta below the setpoint.  Currently,
I repeatedly attempt to turn on the appropriate circulator so long as
the temperature remains below the set range, and I repeatedly turn off
the circulator so long as the temperature exceeds the set range.  This
provides limited fault tolerance.  Turning an appliance module off when it
may be off already or on when it may be on already accomplishes a small
degree of fault tolerance.  Before the next heating season, I expect to
have code to verify the state of the circulator using the supply and

David Lynch is an underutilized software consultant engaged in sometimes fruitless attempts to
make a living developing embedded and systems software&mdash;usually under
Linux.  In another life, he is an architect, and he currently keeps himself
occupied when not randomly turning lights on and off throughout the house
or writing software for clients by building his own home.  Home automation
combines his vocation of software with his interest in buildings, as
well as satisfies his urges for world domination&mdash;at least within his
own home.  Dave can be reached at <a href="mailto:dhlii@dlasys.net">dhlii@dlasys.net</a> and
