Last month, we began to dip our toes into the water of Ajax, the
shorthand name for asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which has taken
the world of Web development by storm.  Ajax applications are Web
applications in every way, depending on the underlying combination of
HTML, HTTP, URLs, JavaScript and CSS that provide a modern Web
infrastructure.  But, they also rely upon several of the features of
modern JavaScript, including its ability to rewrite Web pages and
also to make HTTP requests asynchronously.
</p><p>
And, indeed, this asynchronous behavior is what makes JavaScript&mdash;and
Ajax, for that matter&mdash;so exciting for Web developers.  No longer
are we stuck with the modern equivalent of old-style 3270 terminals,
with execution taking place on the server only when we move from one
page to another.  Now a Web page can be updated without having to
reload the page.
</p><p>
Ajax is not a technical revolution, so much as a conceptual one,
bringing with it new expectations from users and paradigms for
developers.  All of the technology behind Ajax has existed for several
years, but it is only now that we are starting to take advantage of it
in Web applications.
</p><p>
This month, we start to look at one simple example of an Ajax
application, in a context that will probably be familiar to most Web
developers: asking users to register with a Web site.  By the end of
this month's column, you will see how we can combine server-side
programs, an HTML form and JavaScript to check the validity of a form
before it is submitted.  Next month, we will see how we can use Ajax
to overcome the fatal flaws associated with this implementation,
improving the efficiency, robustness and security of the application
all at once.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9e558"></a>
Registering Users</h2></div></div><p>
If you have been developing Web sites for any length of time, you
probably have needed to create a login system.  Such systems come in
all shapes and sizes, and require different levels of security.  For
our example application, we assume that each user has a user name
and password.  Actually, as you will see, we don't care that much
about the password; the key issue here is the user name, which must be
unique.
</p><p>
The first thing to do is create a simple table in our
database to keep track of users:

<pre     class="programlisting">

CREATE TABLE Users (
id              SERIAL    NOT NULL,
username  TEXT       NOT NULL    CHECK (username &lt;&gt; ''),
password   TEXT      NOT NULL    CHECK (password &lt;&gt; ''),
    email_address  TEXT   NOT NULL  CHECK (email_address &lt;&gt; ''),

PRIMARY KEY(id),
UNIQUE(username)
);

</pre>
</p><p>
The above table, defined using PostgreSQL syntax, keeps track of our
users for us.  Every user has a unique numeric ID, stored in the id
column.  (The special SERIAL datatype in PostgreSQL ensures that
each row we INSERT into the database will have a unique value for
id.) For the purposes of this column, we ignore the security
issues associated with storing passwords in plain text.
</p><p>
Next, we define three columns of type TEXT, which PostgreSQL uses to
define limitless text fields.  Each of these fields is also given an
integrity check to ensure that the value can be neither blank nor
NULL.  We also define the username column to be UNIQUE.
</p><p>
Now, from the standpoint of data integrity, we already have done our
jobs.  We can be sure that no two users will have the same user name,
that each e-mail address (that is, each person) is allowed to have more
than one user name in the system, and that the user name, e-mail
address and password cannot be blank.  Everything else is just icing
on the cake, right?
</p><p>
Well, yes&mdash;but only if we are willing to give our users database
errors.  Most of us would prefer to offer a softer landing to our
users, telling them not only that (for example) their chosen user name
already has been taken by someone else, but also shielding them from the
errors that PostgreSQL displays.
</p><p>
This means our application is going to need to take the user's
requested user name, check for it in the database, and then either
display an error message (prompting the user to try again) or
INSERT a new row in the database.
</p><p>
Here is a simple example of how we might do this in a Web page.  I
use simple CGI programs written in Perl for the server-side
examples this month, in no small part because they tend to be simple
to understand and try on any host.  Listing 1 (register.html) shows
the HTML form users will see when they want to register with the
site.  Listing 2 (register.pl) shows the CGI program that will accept
the form contents, check the user name in the database and then
produce a message in response.  My assumption is that the form will be
in the main Web document root directory, and the CGI program will
be in the cgi-bin directory.  Obviously, if you are using a
server-side language, such as PHP, the two can exist side by side.

The HTML form has three text fields, in which the user is requested to
enter a user name, a password and an e-mail address.  (I personally
prefer to use e-mail addresses as user names, but I realize many
people don't, so I'll add it this month.) We know from the database
definition that the user name must be unique in the system, but the
name and e-mail address can each exist multiple times.
</p><p>
The registration program (in Listing 2) is a relatively simple CGI
program.  It connects to the database using Perl's DBI interface, then
uses the standard start of CGI programs, grabbing parameters and
generally getting ready.  The program then checks the database to
see if the user name already exists, returning the number of rows it
matches in the database.  If no rows match, we can assume that
the user name is available.  (There is something of a race condition
here, but we're not going to complicate things with transactions for
this small example.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9edf0"></a>
Making the Form Dynamic</h2></div></div><p>
This is the type of registration form with which most of us are
familiar.  Moreover, this is the type of registration form many
of us continue to implement on various sites.  It's easy for the
programmer to build, it's easy to understand and debug, and it's
compatible with all browsers out there.
</p><p>
The problem is not in the technical underpinnings of the program, but
rather in the user interface.  From nontechnical users' perspectives,
it doesn't make sense for them to enter a user name, password and
e-mail address, then submit it, and only then find out that the
user name is unacceptable.  Surely there must be a way to fix this!
</p><p>
The only way for forms to be checked before they are submitted to a
server is to use a client-side language&mdash;that is, a language
embedded within the Web browser, which can attach itself to browser
window events.  The universal standard for such a language is
ECMAScript, because it was ECMA International (formerly known as the
European Computer Manufacturers Association) that approved and
published the standard.  However, most people refer to ECMAScript by
the language that inspired the standard, namely JavaScript.
</p><p>
JavaScript is almost always found within the pages of an HTML
document.  We can define and invoke functions inside of the document,
triggering the invocations with event handlers.  Thus, we can check the
contents of a form when someone clicks the submit button, before the
contents are sent to the server.  We can change styles when the mouse
moves on (or off) particular text and graphics.  And, we can
execute functions when someone enters or exits an HTML form
element.
</p><p>
Listing 3 contains js-register.html, a modified version of
register.html.  The basic idea in this file is that as soon as the
username text field is modified by the user, the browser executes
the checkUsername function.

            }

            else
            {
                removeText(warning);

    &lt;h2&gt;Register&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" name="username"

        &lt;p&gt;Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;E-mail address: &lt;input type="text" name="email_address" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Register" id="submit-button"
/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
This is the way that most client-side Web programs are structured.
JavaScript functions do the actual work, but they are invoked by event
handlers defined in the HTML.  So, in Listing 3, we see:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" name="username"
    onchange="checkUsername()" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9f318"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This tells the browser that when the username text field changes, it
should invoke the checkUsername() function.  When this function
is executed, it begins with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var new_username = document.forms[0].username.value;
</pre>
</p><p>
The new_username variable gets the value of the username text
field.  We do this by starting off with the document object
(representing our HTML document), then taking the first element of its
forms array (representing the first, and only, form in the
document).  The username property of the form gives us the node for
the username text field, whose value we can then retrieve (as a
string) with the value property.
</p><p>
Traversing the tree in this way is typical when working with
JavaScript.  However, it is also possible to jump immediately to a
particular form element, assuming that element has been assigned an
id attribute.  IDs must be unique within a document, meaning that we
can find a node with the appropriate method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var warning = document.getElementById("warning");
var submit_button = document.getElementById("submit-button");
</pre>
</p><p>
Each of the above two lines uses document.getElementById to retrieve a
node from the document tree, identified with an id attribute.  (If
nothing matches, the variable is set to the null value.)
</p><p>
The list of user names has been hard-coded in Listing 3, which is
something you would never try in an actual application.  I
discuss this further below, and we will find production-quality,
Ajax-style solutions next month.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9f630"></a>
Dynamically Modifying the Page</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have a list of user names in JavaScript, we want to force
the user to choose a user name that does not clash with one already in
use.  We will do this by checking the proposed user name against the
list that we have already collected.  If the user name is already
taken, we will warn the user by modifying the HTML of the current
page and then by disabling the submit button.  Only when the chosen
user name is new and unique will the user be allowed to submit it to
the server.  This doesn't mean we will remove our uniqueness
checks on the server or in the database, but it offloads some of
that checking to the client and makes the application more
immediately responsive to the user's needs.
</p><p>
We do this by iterating over usernames, the array containing
user names:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (i=0 ; i&lt;usernames.length; i++)
{
    if (usernames[i] == new_username)
    {
        found = true;
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
If we find a match between the user's requested new user name and one
in the array, then we set the found variable to be true.  Otherwise,
it continues to be set to false.  This then tells us whether we need
to warn the user about a conflict and disable the submit button or
vice versa.
</p><p>
Warning the user consists of two steps.  The first involves setting
the warning text&mdash;that is, the text inside of the &lt;p&gt; tags above the
form&mdash;to an appropriate message.  We already set the variable
warning to point to that node at the beginning of the checkUsername
function, which means that we now must eliminate all children of the
warning node.  Actually, we don't want to eliminate all children,
but merely the ones with a nodeValue property, because that is where
text is stored.  The removeText function does that by iterating over
each of a node's children, checking to see if it contains text and
removing it if it does:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (node.childNodes)
{
for (var i=0 ; i &lt; node.childNodes.length ; i++)
{
    var oldTextNode = node.childNodes[i];
    if (oldTextNode.nodeValue != null)
    {
    node.removeChild(oldTextNode);
    }
}
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Once we have removed text children from the warning node, we then can
add a new text child to the warning node, containing the
message we want to display.  This is done in the appendText
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function appendText(node, text) {
  var newTextNode = document.createTextNode(text);
  node.appendChild(newTextNode);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As of this point, the user has received a warning about the chosen user name, indicating that it will not be accepted because the
user name was already taken.  However, we cannot rely on users to read
and follow the instructions in a warning message.  Rather, we should
disable the form's submit button, making it difficult for users even to
send the bad user name to our server-side program.  We can do this
by setting the submit button's disabled property:

<pre     class="programlisting">
submit_button.disabled = true;
</pre>
</p><p>
To recap&mdash;when the user enters a value in the username text field
that is in the usernames array, we remove any existing text children
from the warning node.  We then add a new text child node to
warning, indicating that the chosen user name already has been
taken.  Finally, we disable the submit button in the HTML form.
</p><p>
Of course, we want the user to submit the form eventually, but only
after entering a user name not in the usernames array.  This means
we must remove text children from the warning node, and then
re-enable the submit button:

<pre     class="programlisting">
removeText(warning);
submit_button.disabled = false;
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, this combination of JavaScript functions seems to do the
trick.  User names that are not in the usernames array remove any
error messages and re-activate the form, allowing us to submit it to
the server-side CGI program and register with the site.  User names
that are in the array, however, produce a warning and stop us from
being able to submit the form.  It's not Ajax just yet, but it is more
responsive to the user than our pure server-side solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0xd9fbb0"></a>
Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, the program in Listing 3 is fatally flawed in several ways.
The biggest, by far, is the fact that the usernames array is
hard-coded in the JavaScript.  It goes without saying that hard-coding
a list of user names in this way is guaranteed to fail, because the list
of users is stored in a database table, and we have not connected the
database with the program.
</p><p>
We could overcome this problem by generating the usernames array
from the database.  In other words, our server-side program would
create part of our client-side JavaScript program dynamically.  Thus,
instead of what we see in Listing 3:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var usernames = ['abc', 'def'];
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca6580.0x1327798"></a></h2></div></div><p>
we would use a server-side program to do something like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $output = "[";
my $sql = "SELECT username FROM Users";
my $sth = $dbh($sql);
$sth-&gt;execute();
while (my ($username) = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array())
{
    $output .= "'$username', ";
}

$output .= "]";
</pre>
</p><p>
We would then insert $output into the resulting HTML file, ensuring
that the value of usernames would have the most complete and
up-to-date list of user names in the system.
</p><p>
But even this is likely to cause serious security concerns in a
production application, because it means that every user name in your
system&mdash;including those with poorly chosen passwords&mdash;will be
available to everyone visiting your registration page, simply by
looking at the HTML source code.  Although it is true that every user name
has a password, and that someone would have to guess the password
associated with a user name in order to break into your system, can you
really vouch for the quality of every password? Moreover, the
user names themselves might be clues as to the number or types of users
on your system.  In short, you really don't want a production system
to list the user names for a potential attacker, secure as you might
believe your system to be.
</p><p>
There is also an efficiency problem here.  As your list of users grows,
the length of the usernames array will grow as well.  Can you
imagine the time it would take to generate and download the
JavaScript for a site with 10,000 users?
</p><p>
The solution to all of these problems is, of course, Ajax.  Rather than
checking the proposed new user name against an array in our JavaScript
application, we will have JavaScript submit the proposed user name to
the server, find out whether it already has been taken and act
accordingly&mdash;all without forcing the user to switch to a different
page of HTML! This is the underlying magic that makes Ajax
applications so compelling; they keep you on the same page longer than
traditional Web applications, thus providing a smoother user
experience.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We're making some progress on our way to Ajax heaven.  We now have an
application&mdash;user registration&mdash;for which old-style Web
development provides an answer, but one that feels clunky to the
user.  The solution we saw in this month's column works well, but
requires that the JavaScript contain a usernames array with all
user names on the system.  For performance and security reasons, this
is a bad idea, and we should look for a different solution.  Next month,
we will start to look at a genuine Ajax solution to this problem,
making our application look and feel smoother, while increasing its
security as well.

In working on these columns, I have found several good books on the
subject of HTML, JavaScript, Ajax and related technologies.
</p><p>
The two most comprehensive books on the subject are O'Reilly's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em></span> by David Flanagan
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic
HTML: The Definitive Reference</em></span> by Danny Goodman.  There is a fair
amount of overlap between these two books, and they are definitely
meant to be reference books rather than tutorials.  That said,
experienced Web developers interested in learning about client-side
programming probably will learn a great deal from these
books.  And once you're experienced, you will undoubtedly use these
two books often, checking everything from the cross-platform
compatibility of various JavaScript objects to how JavaScript
interfaces with the DOM.
</p><p>
Newer and less experienced Web developers would probably do well to
start with a gentler introduction to these technologies.  One of the
best, and funniest, that I've seen is O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head Rush
Ajax</em></span> by
Brett McLaughlin.  My one criticism is touted as one of the book's
strengths&mdash;namely, that it presents the same information in many
different ways to ensure that you will remember it.  The book might
be a bit annoying for experienced Web developers who will want
to get to the meat more quickly, and who might be frustrated by the
repetition.  Nevertheless, I think that this is a worthwhile read for
anyone starting in the Ajax world.
</p><p>
A middle-of-the-road book that might appeal to more experienced Web
developers, while providing a tutorial and introduction to many
JavaScript concepts described here, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional JavaScript for
Web Developers</em></span> by Nicholas Zakas and published by Wrox.  I didn't
like the way in which Zakas used his own (freely available) JavaScript
library throughout the book, but I did think that the examples and
explanations were carefully chosen and interesting, and they also helped to
illuminate some of the shadier sides of JavaScript.  Zakas contributed
to another Wrox book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Ajax</em></span> by Zakas, Jeremy McPeak
and Joe Fawcett, which I found to be less integrated and less
enjoyable than either the JavaScript book or the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head Rush
Ajax</em></span>
book from O'Reilly.
