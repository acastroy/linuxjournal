<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #150, October 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Just as ext3 emerged as the successor to ext2 after <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> said he
didn't want additional features like journalling to clutter up a stable and
functional filesystem, it now looks like <span   class="bold"><b>ext4</b></span> will emerge as the
successor to ext3. This goes directly counter to the desires of the ext3
maintainers, who don't want to give up their user base or have to struggle
with maintaining divergent source trees between two projects. But, Linus
doesn't consider these to be serious objections, and he is unwilling to
sacrifice the stability and reliability of ext3 for the convenience of its
maintainers. Assuming the controversy doesn't tip the other way, we can look
forward to an ext4 that can hold 1,024 petabytes, instead of ext3's paltry 8
terabytes, and that supports filesystem extents, a technique of preventing
disk fragmentation and slow-down.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has launched a project to support
<span   class="bold"><b>WiMedia Ultra Wide Band (UWB)</b></span> and
the wireless USB standards. UWB is a wireless technology with a very short
range, useful primarily for communicating within a single room. The hardware
supporting this technology is so new that it is apparently still hard to
find. But, Intel is gearing up to support it and has invited the Linux
community to contribute to its effort.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Y. T'so</b></span> has been working on removing as much data as possible from
disk <span   class="bold"><b>inodes</b></span>, and keeping them elsewhere in the kernel. The idea behind this
is that files use a lot of inodes, and accessing a lot of files uses a
lot of
RAM for the inodes. If inodes were smaller, the system would need much less
RAM to deal with open files. The best part is because all filesystems use
inodes, shrinking the inode data structure will improve the memory usage of
every filesystem out there. A bunch of folks, including <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span>, have
been helping to trim the inode data structure. Linus Torvalds also
apparently supports the work, and Ted has very quickly submitted some
patches to accomplish a lot of what he originally set out to do.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sean Estabrooks</b></span> has written a tool to
import <span   class="bold"><b>Perforce repositories</b></span> into
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>
and has posted his code and documentation for inclusion into the git tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jon Smirl</b></span> has begun the arduous task of
attempting to import eight years of
<span   class="bold"><b>Mozilla</b></span> development into git from a CVS repository. Whether the resulting
repository will be used for ongoing Mozilla development remains to be seen.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul Mackerras</b></span> has enhanced <span   class="bold"><b>gitk</b></span> to show the nearest tags (typically
official version numbers) to a given commit. This allows users to
identify more easily which release was first to accept a particular patch.
Because this feature requires a significant amount of computation, Paul
has set it to run in the background and update the display once the
information is derived.
</p><p>
It's now possible to <span   class="bold"><b>alias git commands</b></span> (with all their command-line
arguments) to other names, effectively creating customized commands. This
ability to create short, quick alternatives to commonly used or favorite
commands can save a lot of time if, like Linus Torvalds, you have to
process massive quantities of patches on a daily basis.
</p><p>
There's been a small amount of confusion over the way git should interpret
the <span   class="bold"><b>changelog</b></span> text portion of a patch. <span   class="bold"><b>Eric W.
Biederman</b></span> recently patched
git to interpret From headers anywhere within the changelog entry, as
indicating patch authorship. But, Linus has insisted that the From header
should indicate authorship only when it appears at the very top of the
patch. The reason for this, he says, is that git (and really any version
control system) should never guess at the meaning of data. As he puts it,
&ldquo;SCMs are not about guessing. They are about saving the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exact</em></span> state that
the user asked for. No 'let's try to be nice', no gray areas.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>diff output</b></span> of git can now be
colorized, though the precise command-line
option to do this is still being hashed out. And, as Linus said, the initial
color-set selected for git's diff output &ldquo;will make most people decide to
pick out their eyes with a fondue fork&rdquo;. So, clearly there is some tweaking
still to be done.

<h2 class="title">What's in My Backpack</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #150, October 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Having traveled to more than 60 countries during the past ten years, and
most of them more than once, I have gathered quite a few things in
my backpack that allow me to leave the house feeling confident I
can handle whatever comes my way electronically. Planning ahead helps,
and things have changed over the past ten years, but I noticed
lately that I have not added or left out anything from my backpack for
about a year now, so things seem to be fairly stable. Keeping these items
in the backpack means I have them ready at all times for that &ldquo;next
trip&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The first thing is the backpack itself. After trying more than a few
of them and having them fall apart under heavy use, I finally settled
on the Wenger SwissGear Synergy Model #GA-7305-14. I do not know if
it was really made for the Swiss Army, but it sure seems that way. With
lots of pockets internal and external for stuff, it holds cables and
various wires in their own places so I know where they are. It also
has really strong straps and a carrying handle that is wrapped around a
steel cable&mdash;talk about solid! The zippers are big-toothed and rugged,
good for squeezing the last bit inside the bag.
</p><p>
The model I have seems to be missing from the Wenger site, but I
found it at <a href="http://www.avenuesusa.com/wenger/7305.html" target="_self">www.avenuesusa.com/wenger/7305.html</a>,
and they are carried at a lot of different retailers, such as Circuit City,
Best Buy, Staples and so on.
</p><p>
One warning though, the main pocket is said to fit &ldquo;most
15&ndash;15.4-inch
screens&rdquo;, and some of the on-line reviews talk about the
&ldquo;snugness&rdquo;
of their 15" and even 14" notebook, so if you have a notebook with a
very large screen, this may not be the backpack for you. I do not go
for the largest screens on a laptop, because I expect that the person in
front of me on an airplane will recline his or her seat and crush my laptop
screen. My 12.1" laptop screen avoids this.
</p><p>
The backpack has a separate pocket in the top that carries an audio
player, a set of earphones and the charger for the player, with a hole in
the backpack to thread the earplugs through. I have a set of permanently
installed earphones, so I can listen to music as I walk along and not have
to unthread them when I get to where I am going. If I leave the backpack
some place, I just unplug the earphones, grab the player and another set
of sound-reducing earphones from the pocket and go where I need to travel.
</p><p>
The audio player itself is an iRiver H340, with a 40GB drive. It is
one sweet unit, having the ability to play WMA, MP3 and Ogg formats,
a built-in radio and a microphone to record. Unfortunately, it
records only in MP3 format, but someday I hope iRiver will give its
customers the chance to choose their recording format also. I ripped
my 400+ CD collection into Ogg format and loaded it onto the disk. It
is only about half full, so I can listen to music for more than 150 days
continuously without having to hear the same song by the same artist.
And,
I also can listen to radio, of course. I chose iRiver mostly due to
the Ogg support. I wanted a format that was truly free, and for which
I could get all the software I needed to encode and decode it in source
code format, and without patent issues. Unfortunately, the iRiver people
do not make the H340 anymore, but they do have additional models at
<a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com" target="_self">www.iriveramerica.com</a> that support Ogg. You also
can find a
lot of Ogg players at <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers" target="_self">wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers</a>.
</p><p>
I also carry a Belkin FM Tunecast transmitter (Model F8V3080), which
allows me to broadcast my iRiver (or laptop, or anything with an 1/8-inch stereo jack) to an FM radio, so I can easily listen to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> music
in the hotel room or automobile. This unit is
only for sale and use in the United States, but perhaps other countries
have similar units. Finally, I keep a stereo splitter, with 1/8" stereo
jacks in the same pocket, along with a cheap set of earbuds that are
very light. You never know when a friend may want to listen to your
stereo, and the idea of sharing one set of stereo earbuds between two
people does not cut it with someone who wants to hear
<span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> Simon <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
Garfunkel at the same time.
</p><p>
In the front pocket of the backpack, I keep two Kensington cable locks,
combination type&mdash;one lock for the notebook and one for the media slice
that comes with the notebook. I can run one or both of the cables through
the steel cable of the backpack handle and secure that at the same time. I
chose a combination lock cable because of my usual habit of losing keys.
You can find these at <a href="http://us.kensington.com/html/11209.html" target="_self">us.kensington.com/html/11209.html</a>, but
other manufacturers make them too.
</p><p>
The next pocket has a set of retractable cables from Ultra. This is a
13-piece set that comes in its own carrying case. It includes a stereo
headset with microphone (good for listening and recording voice for
my notebook and also good for VoIP), an RJ-11 cable, RJ-45 cable (with
separate crossover converter), a FireWire Cable, two USB cables and a
bunch of adapters for various sizes of USB and FireWire. The collection
is great, I have never needed any other &ldquo;connecting cables&rdquo;, and the
holder keeps them all organized and ready to go (I often lose cables
too). You can find it at <a href="http://www.ultraproducts.com/product_details.php?cPath=9&amp;pPath=148&amp;productID=148" target="_self">www.ultraproducts.com/product_details.php?cPath=9&amp;pPath=148&amp;productID=148</a>
for $39.99 US, but I have noticed that in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>SkyMall</em></span> airline shopping
magazine, they are listed for a lot less, and for those of you
who do not fly much, here is where you can find them on-line:
<a href="http://www.skymall.com/webapp/skystore?process=prodDisplay&amp;action=&amp;pid=69697606&amp;catId=14101" target="_self">www.skymall.com/webapp/skystore?process=prodDisplay&amp;action=&amp;pid=69697606&amp;catId=14101</a>.
</p><p>
The next thing is pure &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;, but I told you that I would tell
you everything I keep in the backpack....a roll-up piano from
Hecsan. This is my feeble attempt at trying to learn another keyboard, the
musical keyboard. Don't ask me to play something for you, the time that
I have had to practice has been nil, but I keep it there &ldquo;just in
case&rdquo;
I get the time. You can see them at <a href="http://www.hecsaninc.com/home.html" target="_self">www.hecsaninc.com/home.html</a>.
I have the original model, purchased several years ago, and although it is
good, I can see that they have improved it as well.
</p><p>
Moving closer to my back in the backpack is a larger pocket. Here I
keep most of the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; except the notebook itself, which I keep in
a separate pocket in the backpack.
</p><p>
The first thing out of the pocket when I travel is a Kensington adapter
plug. Now, there are a lot of adapters on the market, but they usually
come in many pieces. You know how I am with keys and cables. This
plug is all-in-one and supports the plugs for 150 countries (there
are approximately 200 countries in the world), most exceptionally
South Africa, which has the strangest plug I have ever seen.  I have
the older model (model number 33117) that retails for $19.99 US, but
Kensington also has another model adapter so you can plug in your USB
chargeable device and charge it without having to turn on your notebook
(model number 33346), which retails for $10 US more. Both can be seen at
<a href="http://us.kensington.com/html/11172.html" target="_self">us.kensington.com/html/11172.html</a>.
</p><p>
Into the Kensington, I plug a three-outlet power strip that is very small
and light, which handles 110 up to 240 volts, but uses US plugs. Then
I plug in all my US-plugged devices to this. Now you can see why I
need only one adapter plug. When I am going to plug in only my notebook, I
take out just the Kensington adapter and do not have to bring out the
power strip. Of course, if you are from a different country, you can look
for a power strip that supports your type of plug, but make sure it can
handle all the voltages.
</p><p>
APC (<a href="http://www.apc.com" target="_self">www.apc.com</a>) also makes an interesting UniversalPlug, but do
not throw away the little picture of how to put it together for
all the different socket types of the world. If you do, you will
need to be sure that you have a friend that is good at Rubik's
Cubes, in order to get the plug into the proper configuration
for any socket. I try to keep all three pieces (the plugs and
the instructions) in one pocket of the backpack. The URL is
<a href="http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=INPA&amp;tab=models" target="_self">www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=INPA&amp;tab=models</a>.
</p><p>
Often I get to a place where there is broadband Internet, but not wireless
broadband, only cable. How quaint. So I bring along my D-Link Model
DWL G730AP wireless access point, router and client. I can set up a
wireless bubble for myself and whoever else wishes to use it. This is
also useful in a hotel room that I might be sharing with a group of
people&mdash;that might be interpreted wrong&mdash;I meant a suite
of rooms that I am sharing with a group of people. You can find this
at <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&amp;pid=346" target="_self">www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&amp;pid=346</a> and of course other
manufacturers make similar devices.
</p><p>
When I am looking for a hot spot, I can use my Canary Wireless HS10 Hot
Spot finder (<a href="http://www.canarywireless.com" target="_self">www.canarywireless.com</a>). It has the capability of finding the hot spot, showing
whether
it is &ldquo;open&rdquo; (there is that word again) or
&ldquo;secure&rdquo;, and the signal
strength. By continuing to push the power button, it also shows all
of the hot spots in that area, not just one, and it gives you the ESSID
and channel of the hot spot. Some people simply use their notebook and
appropriate software to do this, but the Canary tells me if it is at
least worth hauling out the notebook. Of course, my notebook does
B/G and A, and Canary does only B and G, but most hot spots are only B
and G anyway. One problem with the Canary is that the power button is
not recessed enough, so sometimes it gets pushed inside of the backpack
and uses up its battery. Careful positioning of the Canary as I put it
back keeps this from happening.
</p><p>
I also carry a Delorme Earthmate GPS unit (USB), so I can run gpsdrive
to find out where the heck I am sometimes. And, I carry an old IBM VGA
camera (Model XVP610) for a portable Webcam. It was very cheap when I
bought it, and if it breaks I will not get upset.
</p><p>
Finally, I normally carry in my backpack a small case for my digital
camera, and in that case I also carry a small recharger for AA batteries
and a couple of sets of those batteries. Most of the portable devices
that use batteries seem to use AA or AAA, and the recharging unit handles
both, four at a time. A PCMCIA card makes the transfer of pictures to
my notebook very quick.
</p><p>
And, there are also a few other dongles for recharging devices, such as
cell phones and PDA devices. I have not looked at the iGO power devices.
</p><p>
The notebook itself is an
IBM X31 with a &ldquo;media slice&rdquo; that provides extra ports, an extra
battery and a removable device bay for CD/DVD reader/writers. I
bought it almost two years ago, and knowing that it would be my
main system for a while, I bought top of the line, with 2GB
of main memory, an 80GB disk, 802.11 b/g/a wireless networking,
FireWire, USB 2.0 and IR. I also prefer the ThinkStick of the IBM
over the glidepad for &ldquo;mousing&rdquo;, but when I am some place where there
is a bit more room, I also have a three-button optical mouse (Newpoint,
<a href="http://www.newpoint.com/catalog.jspa?webcat=3&amp;itemNumber=230828&amp;method=showProduct" target="_self">www.newpoint.com/catalog.jspa?webcat=3&amp;itemNumber=230828&amp;method=showProduct</a>)
that has a self-retractable cord and a clear case so you can see the
components (geeky, I know). The X31 also has a ThinkLight built in,
which illuminates the keyboard for typing at night when you just can't
&ldquo;remember&rdquo; where that particular key is.
</p><p>
I chose the IBM because of its titanium case, good support for Linux
and good field support. Recently, I had to replace the keyboard because
the oils in my hand dissolve plastic (&ldquo;a mutant, you are
maddog!&rdquo;), and they
shipped me the field replaceable keyboard overnight.  The power supply
for the laptop is not only good for the 110&ndash;240 volt crowd, but also
has an adapter for the car cigarette lighter socket and the airplane
seat socket, so I do not have to have a separate power adaptor
to use it in the car or airplane. This is what every vendor should do for
its laptop customers.
</p><p>
I do not do floppy drives anymore, opting for a USB stick, which people
are now giving away from time to time, but taking off the media slice
allows for the X31 to become very small and very light. If I need
a floppy drive, there are plenty that are USB-based and work fine
with Linux.
</p><p>
So there you have it, a combination of components that fit in my
backpack. The next time you see me running through the airport, you will
know that it is not because I forgot a needed piece of equipment!

<a name="mpart2"></a>
<h2 class="title">Bill's Retirement</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Dear Bill,
</p><p>
I read in the paper the other day that you are retiring. Good for you!
I have not quite gotten to that age yet, but I envy those who have put
a little away so they can take early retirement.
</p><p>
Now, you know that you and I have not seen eye to eye on how to make
money over the years. I believe in making people pay money
only once, if that, and you seem to believe that they should pay you again
and again for the same products. Well, that is water over the dam now,
and I just want to make sure that you get on the right path to retirement.
</p><p>
The first thing I should talk to you about is saving money. Now that you
are retired, that income will not just be rolling in as before. You should
think about how to save money. I recommend looking closely at this
&ldquo;Free
Software&rdquo; thing. That is where you pull down the bulk of the software
off the Internet (you know, that thing you said would never catch on)
and then decide if there are any small changes or improvements you need
to make to the software. If there are no changes, you have it for free!
If there are some small changes, all they ask is that you give those
changes back to the group. Nothing wrong with that, is there Bill?
</p><p>
Another thing you should think about is diversifying some of your
investments. This is what my stock advisers keep telling me all the time.
They tell me that when I have a lot of income coming in, it is okay to
play around with those high-risk, high-return stocks, but when you
retire,
you should think about that solid, steady income.
</p><p>
I know that a lot of your money is tied up in that company you started.
That is all well and good, but I have experienced that sometimes
things go downhill after you leave, and you should not put all your eggs
in one basket. I have heard, for instance, that there is this really
interesting startup you might want to put a little seed money into,
called Google. Lots of people are talking about Google, and I think it
could be a good investment for just a little of your &ldquo;mad
money&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I have also heard that you are going to do a lot of volunteer work
with charity. Now those charity people do a lot of things in foreign
countries, and believe it or not, those countries do not speak English all
the time. Once again, you should take a look at that Free Software stuff,
as it allows those countries to change the software to meet their own
cultural needs. And, if you teach them how to do it themselves, they can
save even more money. &ldquo;Teach the man to fish&rdquo;, Bill, remember that line?
</p><p>
This is another reason for you to divest some of your investments,
Bill. You have too much tied up in certain companies that may cloud
your thinking. With as much money tied up in that company you started,
you might think that the best thing for these educational needs, health
needs and job needs are to give them copies of the products produced
by your old company. You need to clear your head! You need to think
outside the box! You need to embrace the idea that Free Software is
the way to go for these charities!
</p><p>
Just think for a moment what happens when you give some of your products
to a poor student in the Congo, and then the WPA program starts acting
up on him. Who is he going to call? And without the source code to WPA,
how is he going to use that software you gave him? Surely you can't
expect him to pay the license fee for the update?
</p><p>
I found some students in South Africa that were studying photography.
When they were using the software in their school, everything was fine.
But when they went home to practice on their own computers, they had
to use pirated software! So I gave them all copies of GIMP, the free
software, and they were pirates no more! See how simple that was?
</p><p>
Now I heard that your good friend Mr Buffett gave somewhere around
$35 billion to your charity fund! That was awful nice of him.
I bet that he has no restrictions on his gift, like making any of the
charitable organizations or groups he is helping buy any of his CDs, or
go to any of his concerts. You need to match his generosity by making
your donations without strings also (Get the joke? Guitar strings?).
</p><p>
So diverse yourself of the temptation, and invest in Free Software
companies like Red Hat Software or even Novell. This will make your
charitable donation stretch the farthest.
</p><p>
Speaking of charitable donations, I wonder how much money the Free
Software people would have generated if they had sold their software again and
again like you did instead of contributing it? Do you think it might
have topped your donations? Mr Buffett's? A lot of margaritas there!
So much about your donations in the press and so little about theirs!
But I bet you can fix that when you start supporting Free Software.
</p><p>
Well, that is about all the news and advice I have to send you for
right now. I will note that the papers said it would take you two years
to remove yourself from the company you created. My gosh! I am glad you
have never been hit by a truck! The company might have collapsed without
you! If this is true, it is probably about time for you to move on.
But I would even more strongly suggest that you diversify your portfolio.
</p><p>
Say hello to Melinda for me, and tell me how she liked the penguin
earrings I sent to her.
</p><p>
Warmest regards,
</p><p>
maddog
</p><p>
P.S. My secretary tells me that it was Warren Buffett that gave you the
donation, and not Jimmy. Too bad. I never met Warren personally, nor
played cards with him, but I think Jimmy would have been more fun at your
retirement party. And, you can forget the joke about the guitar strings.

John and his longtime friend and ex-partner, Peter Fox, go back to
biblical times. In those days, such scriptural characters as
Methuselah lived to be, quite literally, thousands of years old.
John, himself, is thousands of years old and Peter Fox is, in fact,
Methuselah. Before they founded Fox &amp; Fluevog, in the ancient
biblical age of 1970, they were shepherds. Actually, they worked at
Sheppard's, a venerable Vancouver shoe emporium, albeit a tad on the
conventional side.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The story goes from here to Fox &amp; Fluevog, &ldquo;the very coolest place to
treat the feet and has remained so ever since&rdquo;. Then:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Around 1980, Peter
heard the siren song of New York City and moved there to open his own
store, specializing in design of Ladies' (particularly wedding) shoes.
John took over the business and built it into the multinational mega
corporation it is today, along the way forging his undaunted reputation
for the world's most distinctive shoes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The FAQ below has questions such as &ldquo;What's the capital of
Uruguay?&rdquo;
(The answer is in Spanish.) And, &ldquo;Are John Fluevog Angels really Satan
resistant?&rdquo; (Answer: &ldquo;You're wearing Angels right now, right? Look
around&mdash;do you see him?&rdquo;)

Among the many delightful pages on the extensive Fluevog.com site is one
(<a href="http://www.fluevog.com/files_2/os-1.html" target="_self">www.fluevog.com/files_2/os-1.html</a>) that goes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You've Heard of Open Source Software? Get Ready for John Fluevog's
Open Source Footwear.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But how can a software concept work with shoes?&rdquo;, we hear you gasp in astonishment. Keep reading.
</p><p>
YOU ALL KNOW how open-source software works, right. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sure you
do</em></span>:
everybody has access to the program's source code and anybody who
thinks of an improvement can just write it up and send it in. If
others use it, Yahtzee! Everybody wins! It's simple, it's
people-driven, it's non-monetary and it makes software people
really want. <span   class="emphasis"><em>We're going to make shoes the same way.</em></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In a word balloon from a video frame of John Fluevog speaking:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's
a concept that's well, maniacally tremendous: got an idea for a
shoe? Even just for part of a shoe? Scribble it down and send it to
me. I don't care if it's on a bar napkin, as long as I can make it out.
</p><p>
ARE YOU FRUSTRATED, not finding the shoes you really want? Is your
imagination ahead of the whole shoe industry and you're sick of
waiting for them to catch up? Here's your chance to go over their
heads and deal with someone who really cares what you want. All you
need is a brilliant idea. Fax it, mail it, upload it, e-mail it,
bring it in&mdash;just get it to me.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
These lead to an updated Results page where readers can vote on
submitted designs.
</p><p>
And below that is a link to a page that explains open source as &ldquo;both a
software philosophy and an important progressive movement&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Not coincidentally, the Fluevog site runs fast for a graphics-heavy one.
It should be no surprise that it's served by Apache off Linux servers in
Vancouver, BC. Same with Peter Fox Shoes.
</p><p>
By the way, if your shoes really do get produced, John names them after
you, and the design goes into the public domain&mdash;as well as admission to
what John modestly calls &ldquo;the hallowed ranks of Fluevog Design
Alumni&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If any of you submit designs, and they turn into real Vogs on real feet,
send photos to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and we'll show them here.

Every night there's a Mashup get together, or a TechCrunch party, or
it's Tag Tuesday, or SuperHappyDevHouse, or SXSW, or this conference or
that conference. And this stuff is fun. It's a real community. But all
of these things are great by themselves, but terrible in combination. I
see some entrepreneurs in photos from <span   class="emphasis"><em>every single
event</em></span>. Who's
talking to the users, writing the code, tweaking and retweaking the UI?
It ain't the Chief Party Officer.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the
notion that because a man or a corporation has made a profit out of the
public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged
with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the
face of changing circumstances and contrary public interest. This
strange doctrine is not supported by statute nor common law. Neither
individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask
that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back, for their private
benefit.
