This article presents a basic overview of some of the programs
available for Linux to create and work with digital images.  The programs
discussed here are those that were installed by default or by the package
management programs of SUSE and Kubuntu on my systems.  They are fairly
standard and should be available for the major distributions.  My preferred
desktop environment is KDE, so the choices are slanted in that direction,
though I indicate where a program also works on GNOME, or where there is
an alternative.  This is becoming less of an issue, as it is possible to
run GNOME applications on KDE and vice versa.  In fact, as the screenshots
show, I did all my work in KDE.  To bring some organization to the article,
the programs are introduced in work-flow order.  See the on-line Resources for
versions of software used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf50580.0x10483a0"></a>
Scanning with Kooka</h2></div></div><p>
To convert images in a nondigital format,
it is necessary to scan the image and capture the output into a digital
file.  The software of choice for this is SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy).
SANE takes care of connecting to the physical devices (the scanners)
and passing information to and from them.  Any one of a number of front ends
handles the user interface for the
scanner.  The two
covered here are Kooka and XSane.  Kooka is an official part of the KDE
Graphics Package, and as such, is found in the KDE menu.  XSane is an
independent project.  Support for scanners is provided by the libraries
from the SANE Project, so if you need to determine whether your scanner
will work, go to the SANE Web site (see Resources).  To scan, open Kooka
from the KDE Graphics menu item (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f1.large.jpg"><img src="9000f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.  Kooka Showing a Preview with an Area Selected for the Final Scan
</p></div></div><p>
Scanning a color photograph entails selecting a Scan mode of color and the
appropriate resolution.  The Source item also may need to be selected (for
instance, I use a Epson 1240U that has the choice of a flatbed scanner
or transparency unit).  Select Preview Scan.  This generates an image
in the preview box to the right.  It is then possible to use your mouse
to select the portion of the preview that you want to scan.  Select
Final Scan.  At the end of the scanning process, a dialog box pops up,
asking you in which format to save the scanned image.  Saving the
image creates a thumbnail image in the box at the bottom right and adds
the image to the Kooka Gallery at the top left.  For further work with
an image, select the Image menu item and then Open Graphic Application
to use the image editor you prefer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf50580.0x10486b8"></a>
Scanning with XSane</h2></div></div><p>
XSane can be run either in KDE or GNOME.  To open XSane, again go to the
Graphics menu item and select XSane.  One immediate difference you will
notice is that
XSane opens a host of windows (Figure 2).  I generally have the Standard
Options, Advanced Options and Preview windows open in addition to the
Program window.  This can be controlled by clicking on the Window menu
item in the Program window and selecting or deselecting the appropriate
items.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f2.large.jpg"><img src="9000f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  XSane with the Preview Image and Final Scan Image
</p></div></div><p>
The information in the Advanced Options window will vary according
to the capabilities of the scanner you are using.  To start a scan, go to the Program window
and select the necessary values.  To scan a print, select Viewer, Color,
flatbed, full color range and 300 in descending order for the output, image
type, source, color range and resolution choices.  If the output is going
to an inkjet, in the Advanced Options section, set the Color correction
to Inkject
Printers.
</p><p>
With the settings taken care of, click the Acquire preview
button in the Preview window.  The preview scan displays in the Preview
window, and you can use the mouse to select an area for the
final scan.  Clicking on the Scan button in the Program window initiates
the scan with the resulting image displayed in an image viewer.  The
viewer has some limited abilities as far as editing the image, but its primary
purpose is to proof the scan.  Selecting the File menu item accesses the
Save image menu item.  From here, you can save the image in any one of a
variety of formats.
</p><p>
A side note&mdash;for my scanner, in the Advanced
Options section,
there is the ability to focus on the glass or 2.5mm above the glass.  For
negatives in the the film holder or slides in thick mounts, the 2.5mm
setting is best.  You may want to experiment with
this setting to see what works best.
</p><p>
XSane also works as a
plugin to The GIMP.  This means if you are using The GIMP for your
image-editing chores, you can go to
File&rarr;Acquire&rarr;XSane&rarr;Device Dialog from The GIMP and call up XSane directly.  The final
scanned image will be loaded directly into The GIMP for further editing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf50580.0x1048ad8"></a>
digiKam</h2></div></div><p>
For working with pre-existing
digital images, we look at two
applications, digiKam for KDE users and F-Spot for GNOME users.  Both
serve as clients for the gPhoto2 libraries.  gPhoto2 is an open-source
project that has created a software interface for digital cameras.  At
the time of this writing, it supports approximately 600 cameras (see Resources).  digiKam
is found in the Graphics menu item on the KDE start menu.  Clicking on
the program opens a single window (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f3.large.jpg"><img src="9000f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  digiKam Showing Downloaded Images
</p></div></div><p>
When you open digiKam the
first time,
you need to set up the camera.  Make sure the camera
is plugged in to the computer and turned on.  Select Camera&rarr;Add
Camera from the menu bar.  First try Auto-Detect.  If this does not work,
click Add, and browse the list for your camera.  Many cameras don't
show up in the list but instead fall under the generic category of
mass storage devices.  Do not despair.  When you hook up the camera to
the computer and turn it on, it should show up on the desktop as a removable
storage device.  If this is the case and you cannot find the camera in the
list, go to the right side of the window and select the port type (most
likely USB) and camera mount path.  The easiest way to find the mount path
is to right-click the removable storage icon on the desktop and look
under Properties.
</p><p>
Once you set up the camera, the fun begins.  From
the Camera menu item, select the camera or Directory Browse if it is seen
as a storage device.  This opens a window with the pictures stored on
the camera.  From here, you can use the buttons across the bottom to work
with the images.  When you download, you have the option of creating a new
directory or storing to an existing directory.  The pictures will show up
in the right panel of the digiKam window.  Opening an image loads it into
an image viewer.
</p><p>
One stock capability of note found in the Fix menu item
of the image viewer is Red Eye Reduction.  The capabilities of the image
viewer, as well as digiKam in general, can be extended by installing plugins.
digiKam uses the KIPI (KDE Image Plugin Interface, see Resources) to
manage plugins.  The plugins include a module to work with RAW images.  See
the sidebar for information on RAW.  It is possible to convert a RAW file to a
JPEG, TIFF or PPM format.  In versions 0.8.1 on, 8-bit RAW files can be
opened in the image viewer, with 16-bit support promised in version 0.9.0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf50580.0x1048ea0"></a>
F-Spot</h2></div></div><p>
F-Spot serves the same role in GNOME as digiKam does in KDE.  It is not
as far along in the development cycle as digiKam, so it is not quite as
feature-rich.  However, it does work well for pulling pictures from a camera
and organizing them on your hard drive.
</p><p>
Opening the program presents a
single window with a couple panes (Figure 4).  In the right pane are
thumbnails of the pictures that have been downloaded.  Right-clicking on
an image brings up a menu that, among other things, allows you to tag the
image.  There is a set of predefined tags, and you can create
your own tags using the menu bar item Tags.  The tag labels
are listed in the left pane, and selecting them filters the thumbnails
accordingly.
</p><p>
An interesting feature of the thumbnail browser is the
time-line bar across the top.  It represents a visual indication of the
number of pictures by month and year.  Use the mouse to move the slider (as
you do so, you will see a date appear above the slider) to the
month and year you are interested in.

Image Editing&mdash;The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
The discussion to this point has been concerned with getting pictures
into the computer from an external source.  Some mention has been made
of manipulating images.  Kooka, XSane, digiKam and F-Spot all can change
the imported images to some degree, but to do more in-depth editing, it
is necessary to use a dedicated image program.  For this task, we
look at The GIMP and CinePaint.  The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
Program) has been around since 1995 and is probably the most widely
known open-source image program.  CinePaint started as a fork of
The GIMP in 1998, known as Film GIMP (also Hollywood GIMP and GIMP16)
and acquired its current name in March 2003.
</p><p>
The GIMP follows
the multiple window paradigm we saw earlier with XSane (Figure 5).  The
program window contains the toolbox.  Placing the cursor over a tool icon
brings up a help tip, and selecting an icon loads the tool options into the
bottom half of the window.  Once a tool is selected, moving the
cursor over the image window shows the cursor pointer along with
the tool icon, and left-clicking the mouse causes the tool action to
take place.  For example, selecting the eraser icon erases the area
under the cursor according to the parameters selected in the
tool options box (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f5.large.jpg"><img src="9000f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 6.  Using the Eraser
</p></div></div><p>
Space does not permit a full exploration
of the features in The GIMP, so I point out those I have found
particularly useful.  First, in an open image window, select Tools&rarr;Color
Tools&rarr;Levels.  A new window opens (Figure 7).  Look for the Auto
button, click on it and the image color levels are adjusted automatically
(Figure 8).  Often this is all you need to do to improve
a picture.  If the Auto correction does not work, next to the Auto
button is a row of eye dropper icons representing the black point,
grey point and white points of the image.  Use one of the eye droppers
to select a &ldquo;known&rdquo; color point in the picture, and the picture
adjusts accordingly.  You can undo your changes by clicking on Reset,
so experiment away.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f7.large.jpg"><img src="9000f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 8.  The GIMP&mdash;Auto-Adjust, After
</p></div></div><p>
This leads me to another often-used feature of The
GIMP: Ctrl-Z&mdash;the undo command.  The extent to which you can
undo is set in the Preferences item of the File menu.  The two main
parameters are the minimal number of undo levels and the maximum undo
memory.  The first specifies the number of undos to save, regardless of
memory usage.  The second causes undo to drop items once they exceed the
memory limit, except those exempted by the first parameter.  The undo
command has
some other limitations; see the manual for a full
rundown, but it does allow you to experiment with relative impunity.
</p><p>
This
is good place to insert a practical tip learned in the school of hard
knocks.  Do not work with your original image.  The first step when working
with an image is to create a copy and work with the copy.  That way, when
you paint yourself into a corner or commit an unrecoverable act, you
still have the original to start over with.
</p><p>
The real flexibility comes
through the plugin architecture of The GIMP.  The program comes with a
series of default plugins, and you can extend these by downloading others
(see Resources).  Plugins can show up in many areas, so the best way
to identify what is available is to use the plugin browser located in
the Xtns menu item of the program window.  One optional plugin I have
found particularly useful is UFRAW (see Resources).  It allows you to
get around the 8-bit limitation current versions of The GIMP have on RAW
files.  Basically, it loads a RAW file into its own viewer at its native
bitrate and allows you to adjust the image (Figure 9).  After the image
has been changed in the plugin, clicking OK mixes it down to the 8-bit
format of The GIMP and opens a window for further work in The GIMP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9000f9.large.jpg"><img src="9000f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

CinePaint</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, CinePaint is a fork of The GIMP.  The program was
developed to meet the needs of image retouchers in the movie industry.
One of the requirements was the ability to work with
high-resolution images.  Consequently, CinePaint has native support for
RAW images and other high-bit formats.  The trade-off is the inability to
use GIMP plugins.  There is work in progress to correct this, but it is in
the development branch of the project.  Still, the program shares many
features with The GIMP, so if you are looking for some fairly advanced
editing of high-bit images, it is a simple step up (Figure 10).

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It is possible for a relative beginner to work with digital images
in Linux.  The tools exist, and if not installed by default, are readily
available.  My personal work flow is to use XSane for scanning my print and
slide collection, digiKam for bringing in images from my digital camera
and The GIMP for retouching images.  This article has touched on
the basics of the programs explored.  See the on-line Resources
for a wealth of documentation for those who want to delve deeper.

The Lowdown on RAW files</b></p><p>
RAW images are, in essence, digital negatives.  They represent the
uncorrected output of the digital camera sensor.  As such, they contain
more photo information than a processed JPEG.  For instance, a RAW will
have bit depth of 12&ndash;14 per color versus that of 8 for a JPEG.  The result
is an image that allows for more editing opportunities.  The
downside is that this information increases the size of the files, so
fewer images will fit on a memory card.
