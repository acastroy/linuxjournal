I recently had a conversation with a person in the tech world who does a
lot of hiring. He started our conversation with a pretty open-ended
request: &ldquo;Shawn, talk
to me about Linux and how it matters to people looking for a job.&rdquo; I
assumed he was asking me why people should or shouldn't add Linux
expertise to their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Or, perhaps he was trying to get me to explain
why a Linux professional is a value even in an environment largely
containing Microsoft products. I was absolutely incorrect. The value of
Linux already was assumed. He was asking how people should go about gaining
training and experience! Let me say that again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>the value of Linux was
already assumed</em></span>. It's like we're living in the future! On that note, let's
learn about Linux.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts off this issue with a how-to on migrating from Python 2 to
Python 3. The transition was such that code doesn't automatically work in
version 3 if it worked in version 2. That's not to say it's not worth
moving to 3, just that it requires work. Reuven gives tips on working
through that
process incrementally. 
</p><p>
Next, Dave Taylor finishes his series on &ldquo;spinning&rdquo; text, creating
automated, personalized messages. It's a fascinating look at how computers
are being used to do the sorts of things that used to require a human
touch. Plus, it's just really awesome to see in action!
</p><p>
Continuing his series on Qubes, Kyle Rankin is back this month explaining
how to secure the security-focused distribution even further. Figuring out the
advanced features of Qubes is just one more way to make your secure
environment customized for your security needs. 
</p><p>
My column this issue is
more informational than educational. I often am asked about what I use on
a daily basis, and I'm traveling this month, so I figured it was the perfect
time to talk about how I work when traveling. I'm probably drastically
different from anyone else, but perhaps one or two things I do might be
useful for my fellow nerdy travelers.
</p><p>
John S. Tonello provides part 3 of his &ldquo;Tiny Internet Project&rdquo;, where he
teaches how to create your own diverse network infrastructure using
virtualization and elbow grease. This month you'll learn how to get those
installed systems going, so you can do whatever experimentation or learning
you desire. If you've been following along with this project, you won't want
to miss this conclusion. 
</p><p>
Finally, Amit Saha delves deep into
development with a look at coroutines and channels in the C language. If
you are writing concurrent applications in C, you'll want to check out the
libmill library, and Amit walks through its usage.
</p><p>
Just like every month, we have extensive looks at new products, reviews of
existing technology, tips and tricks. Plus, we have a look at the
implications of Linux and open source in our society with Doc Searls' EOF.
Whether you are just learning Linux to make your r&eacute;sum&eacute; sparkle or are
trying to learn even better ways to utilize Linux in your environment, this
issue is bound to please. We hope you enjoy it as much as we've enjoyed
putting it together!
