The more expensive regulators make wireless&mdash;and for no good
reason&mdash;the more our lives are lived inside walled gardens.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1326580.0x141e300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux was born and grew within an ecosystem of norms, not laws. Those norms were
those of programming (C), operating systems (*NIX), command shells (bash, etc.),
e-mail (SMTP, etc.) licenses (GPL, etc.) and Internet protocols (TCP/IP and the
rest).
</p><p>
Had Linux and the Internet been left up to the world's big operating system and
network providers, we never would have had either one. Instead, we would have had
what business giants and their captive regulators are inclined to believe both
actually are: &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and billable
&ldquo;services&rdquo;.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Free&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo; are the adjectives that best describe the development ethos
that allowed Linux and the Internet to happen. Yes, there were regulations
around, but Linux and the Net grew up outside the scope of what Bob Frankston
calls The Regulatorium
(<a href="http://www.frankston.com/public/?name=RealityVRegulatorium" target="_self">www.frankston.com/public/?name=RealityVRegulatorium</a>).
To a blessed degree they still do, but that degree is
getting narrower and less blessed as more of our computing and communicating
moves to mobile devices.
</p><p>
For the most part, those devices are not native to the open Internet. Although they
can operate on the Internet (and in the case of Android devices, run on a breed
of Linux), they are native by design to the walled commercial gardens of
cellular telephone companies. These are regulatory zoo animals that also happen
to run the zoo&mdash;at least in how they conceive wireless communications and
influence regulators.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most expensive and retro conceptual framework for wireless
communications is one that carriers and regulators buy completely and the rest
of us hardly ever question. That framework is <span   class="emphasis"><em>spectrum</em></span>.
As artificial scarcities
go, spectrum might be the largest and most expensive in world history.
And yet,
it remains the prevailing frame for understanding wireless, both for regulators
and for ordinary muggles.
</p><p>
Take, for example, this story: &ldquo;A major New York TV station could win $900
million&mdash;if it goes off the air. Here's why&rdquo;,
by Brian Fung, in the October 16,
2015 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Washington Post</em></span>. In it, he points to this list of opening
reverse auction prices on the spectra occupied by TV stations in every US
market, including those in its overseas territories:
<a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db1016/DA-15-1191A2.pdf" target="_self">transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db1016/DA-15-1191A2.pdf</a>. Topping the list is WCBS-TV
in New York, better known there as Channel 2 (even though it actually operates
on Channel 33, spanning 584&ndash;590MHz). Price: $900 million. He explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The figures represent the maximum amount each broadcaster could receive for
participating in a never-before-tried auction of wireless airwaves, one that's
designed to transfer control of that invisible real estate to wireless carriers
such as AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Cellular providers say they need access to more of
the radio spectrum to build out next-generation mobile data networks. (All
wireless data, from TV signals to 4G LTE, ride atop spectrum, a finite
resource.)
</p></blockquote></div><p>
What he's talking about here is auctioning off over-the-air TV channels to
wireless carriers, in faith that the wireless carriers can do more with those
channels (collections of adjacent frequencies) than the TV stations can&mdash;which
is probably true. The FCC is also making it possible for stations to bid on
other lower-frequency channels that are less desirable for cellular wireless but
just fine for over-the-air TV. Since most people watch cable rather than
over-the-air TV, the stations might not want to buy other channels at all.
A
for-sure end result of all this is that over-the-air TV will end up even more
dead than it is already.
</p><p>
But, the framing is what matters most here. &ldquo;Real estate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a finite resource&rdquo;
are taken as givens&mdash;independent variables, beyond question.
</p><p>
Yet, what we're also talking about here is what Bob Frankston correctly calls
&ldquo;selling the color blue&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that spectrum shouldn't be for sale at all.
</p><p>
Wireless communications has no more need for &ldquo;providers&rdquo; to buy spectrum than
any of us have for providers selling us the color blue in order for us to see or
use it. Rather than explaining the rest of what that means, I'll turn the floor
over to David P. Reed, one of the Internet's founding figures and a scientist of
the first water, writing to a list I'm on:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So there's a fundamental technical question regarding radio systems
architectures, which relates to sharing of the medium (colloquially, the
airwaves). I've written and spoken about this for decades now, as an engineer.
Here's the question:
</p><p>
Is it technically necessary to build regulation into the burgeoning, and highly
localized, growth of communications? (And a corollary: why can't computationally
powerful radio-networked systems just cooperate, for the mutual benefit of all
users of the airwaves?) The answer appears to be No (and They Absolutely Can).
</p><p>
Now the key here is &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo;.
</p><p>
There's a great incentive for cooperation in communications. That's the entire
basis for the success of the Internet! The fact that standardizing on a single
abstract framework for communications that is technologically agnostic both in
regard to the transport infrastructure (and airwaves) and the applications has
actually completely upended the communications industry and how all citizens of
the world do their interaction <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be obvious....
</p><p>
Radio networks can sense the airwaves and modify their behavior&mdash;as a
network&mdash;cooperatively to make the best of what they are capable of doing.
Now that we have software and powerful signal processing in every radio chip,
cooperation is not that hard.
</p><p>
And there's a huge return on &ldquo;effort&rdquo; to cooperation....We know that what is
possible is far better than what is achieved by cooperative systems today....
</p><p>
Cooperation at the local level is <span   class="emphasis"><em>easy</em></span> because people control their own
real estate. We don't need the FCC to tell us that we can turn devices on or off
if they mess up our local environment. That's the genius of Part 15
(<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2c611742f6c4a4a15e73ae11cd4dd12a&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5" target="_self">www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2c611742f6c4a4a15e73ae11cd4dd12a&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5</a>).
</p><p>
So the combination of incentives to cooperate to get better use out of the
airwaves (now technically feasible, far more than ever before, because of
Moore's Law, information theory, and digital signal processing, as well as
amazing improvements in analog semiconductor technology for sensing and
transmitting), AND the desire to make our <span   class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span>
environments work well <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be
enough.
</p><p>
But in DC...the issue is &ldquo;who wins?&rdquo; [When] the real question should be: what
serves the public interest?
</p><p>
And in terms of local communications, what serves the public interest is locally
managed, freely chosen, technologies that cooperate and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>interoperate</em></span> to at least
some extent.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Everything David talks about here is outside the framework of spectrum. It's
just radios talking to radios, the best ways they can. These new-generation
radios are like the Internet that way. TCP/IP, the Internet's founding and
persistent protocol suite, specifies a &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; for getting data from any
one end to any other, regardless of who owns and operates the
&ldquo;pipes&rdquo; (wireless
or otherwise) between those ends. The possibilities it opens are boundless. But
you can't see them if you remain stuck inside old framings.
</p><p>
On one of the many Geek Cruises that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> hosted back around the turn
of the Millennium, we visited the Aricebo Observatory in Puerto Rico,
a primary
collection point in SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
SETI looks mostly in the microwave window of frequencies where the most can be heard
across outer space and presumably where the most is being transmitted by distant
intelligent beings.
In the beginning of SETI, a framing assumption was that
extraterrestrials possibly would be radiating radio and television in a manner
like unto our own systems of that time.
</p><p>
Back then, TV stations radiated up to five million watts toward the horizon (near
the lower-frequency range of that microwave window). The most powerful digital
transmitters of today's stations are still one million watts. Meanwhile, cell tower
transmissions are a few watts at most, and the phones in our pockets use
fractions of a single watt. In other words, all are so weak, on purpose, that
even the most sensitive receivers light years away have no hope of detecting
them.
</p><p>
Cellular communications, which relies on local and low power transmission, was,
and remains, a huge and highly original invention&mdash;one that made it possible to
crowd many more communication paths into local and worldwide geography than
ever would have been possible with brute-force transmissions of the old
broadcast school.
</p><p>
What cellular did was free us from believing that bigger was better. Now we need
the same kind of liberation from the belief that spectrum is scarce. Because
it's not. And selling it makes no sense, except to business as usual, its
captive regulators and the billions of people who still don't know better.
Let's change that.
