    Using Netfilter and ipchains to increase security on home
    systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d265b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>For those of you who have taken the
plunge and upgraded from kernel 2.2.X (or even 2.0.X) to 2.4.X,
congratulations. If, like a number of folks, you're running some
form of firewall using either ipchains or ipfwadm, your scripts may
work fine. But sooner or later you're probably going to want to
upgrade.
</p><p>In the 2.4.X kernels, Rusty Russell, the Linux packet-filter
guru, and his crew of coders have implemented Netfilter into the
kernel. Netfilter is the replacement for ipchains or ipfwadm.
Fortunately, Netfilter permits you to keep using ipchains or
ipfwadm until you can come to grips with iptables by adding a
compatibility layer via a kernel module that permits these older
packet filters to run. But Netfilter has so many exciting new
additions, you'll want to convert those rules as soon as possible.
One word of caution, though, if you load the ipchains or ipfwadm
modules, you can't load ip_tables (and vice versa). So it's all or
nothing. After reading this article, however, making the change
should be easy.</p><p>For those new to packet filtering, ignore the ipchains
translations and use the iptables examples. While not all ipchains
commands and options will be translated to iptables, this text
should provide a good idea about how to construct a packet-filter
firewall by translating ipchains commands into iptables
commands.</p><p>The reason you'll want to upgrade to Netfilter is because it,
unlike ipchains or ipfwadm, is stateful. What this means is it can
track connections and permit incoming responses to outgoing
requests without creating gaping holes in the firewall. The
connection tracking opens a specific, temporary hole for responses
and only from the contacted server. We'll see how this works later.
The drawback is that with connection tracking in use, Netfilter
will need to use a little more memory because the connections are
tracked in RAM. So your 4MB 386-16 may no longer be up to the job,
depending on your filtering requirements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d267c0"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>The actual Netfilter implementation is broken into two parts,
the kernel portion known as Netfilter and the userland tool that
interfaces with Netfilter and creates the rulesets, iptables. Both
are required to implement your packet-filtering firewall.</p><p>First, we'll concentrate on the kernel portion. Netfilter
includes support for IPv4 and IPv6. It does not, however, filter
any other protocols, so your firewall should not run IPX, AppleTalk
or any other protocol that might be used to circumvent iptables
rules. Similarly, you must not enable the kernel fast-switching
option. This item is one of the last ones in the network options
section of the kernel's configuration menu. The code permits fast
switching at a low level in the IP stack. The Netfilter code
resides at a much higher level, so fast switching effectively
bypasses Netfilter completely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d26920"></a>Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>In order to get started using Netfilter, you'll need to have
your kernel compiled for Netfilter support. Most distributions
include this support by default, so a quick test is in order. If
you can insert the module ip_tables, then you won't need to worry
about this section. As root, run the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe ip_tables
</pre><p>Then run
<pre     class="programlisting">
lsmod | grep ip_tables
</pre>


If ip_tables show up, you're in good shape. If not, don't worry,
rebuilding a kernel is extremely easy. This text won't cover the
complete kernel rebuild process, but many resources are available
to help you through this step. If you find you need to rebuild your
kernel, the Sidebar will provide you some guidance on what to
include for a complete Netfilter-enabled kernel.

Kernel</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d26be0"></a>Netfilter Modules</h2></div></div><p>If you've built and installed all the modules, all modules
will auto-install when a rule is entered except ip_tables,
ip_nat_ftp and ip_conntrack_ftp. These can be loaded either
manually or as part of your iptables startup script.</p><p>A full build and installation of Netfilter produces a large
number of modules, but most firewalls will only use a few. The
modules that aren't loaded aren't taking up memory, so don't worry
about what you don't use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d26d40"></a>Getting and Installing iptables</h2></div></div><p>Your distribution may have installed iptables, and it almost
certainly did if your kernel has Netfilter support. But if you want
the very latest, you'll probably have to get it from the Netfilter
site. Netfilter is available at
<a href="http://netfilter.filewatcher.org" target="_self">netfilter.filewatcher.org</a>.
Download and compile it according to the instructions in the
INSTALL file. The following instructions assume the kernel sources
are in /usr/src/linux. If not, adjust the following instructions
appropriately. If you need to run</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make pending-patches KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
make patch-o-matic KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux
</pre>


then you'll need to recompile your kernel before continuing.
Otherwise, you can ignore these two commands. In general, the
patch-o-matic is for users with special needs and is of interest to
the average user.
</p><p>After running</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux
</pre><p>run
<pre     class="programlisting">
make install KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux
</pre>


You're now ready to use iptables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d27108"></a>The iptables Command Line</h2></div></div><p>The iptables command line is broken down into as many as six
parts. The first part is the iptables command, which will not be
discussed further. The second part is the table specification, and
the chain name is the third part. The fourth part is the rule
specification, which is the part of the command to match against
the IP or ICMP header, but also could be a rule number in some
incantations. The fifth part is the target, and the sixth part is
the target option. The general command line, then, looks
like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables [-t <span   class="emphasis"><em>table</em></span>] -ACDI CHAIN rule-specification &aring; -j TARGET [<span   class="emphasis"><em>target option</em></span>]
</pre><p>The above does not hold true for all incantations but is the
most common. You will also find the -L command useful. It will be
covered in this article, along with several other command-line
variants.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d27370"></a>Tables and Chains</h2></div></div><p>Netfilter has three tables you need to concern yourself with:
filter, nat and mangle. This article, whenever it shows an iptables
incantation, will always have a table specified. However, if no
table is specified, the filter table is assumed. Therefore, if you
do not specify a table and your rule fails, try putting a table
specification in and try again.</p><p>Each table has certain chains available to it. User-created
chains will belong to one and only one table. You will see that
some built-in chains belong to more than one table, but this is
only true for built-in chains. You cannot mix chains from other
tables within user-created chains.</p><p>The filter table is the basic packet-filter table and has the
built-in chains INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT. Rules added to
user-created chains created in the filter table can only contain
targets valid in the INPUT, FORWARD or OUTPUT chains. Packets
traversing the filter table will pass through one and only one of
INPUT, FORWARD or OUTPUT. The INPUT chain will only be traversed if
the packet's destination is the local system. The FORWARD chain
will only be traversed if the packet is passing through the local
system and bound for another system. And the OUTPUT chain is
traversed only by packets originating on the local system with an
external destination. Only one chain will be traversed by any given
packet. This is in contrast to ipchains that always used the input
and output chains and also used the forward chain if the packet was
passing through.</p><p>Note that in the previous paragraph, the iptables chain names
were capitalized, while the ipchains chain names were not. This was
deliberate and reflects a change in syntax.</p><p>The nat table performs network address translation. Built-in
chains for nat are PREROUTING, POSTROUTING and OUTPUT. Each chain
permits a particular target. The PREROUTING accepts the DNAT
target, and the remaining chains accept the SNAT target. More on
these targets shortly.</p><p>The mangle table is used to change (mangle) information other
than the IP address in the header. It can be used to mark the
packets, change type of service (TOS) or change time-to-live (ttl)
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d27630"></a>Rules</h2></div></div><p>The rule-specification portion of each iptables command is
the heart of the command. By properly crafting your rule, you can
select exactly which packets to which a rule should apply. This
selection criteria can be as general or as specific as you need. In
most cases, you'll want to make sure specific criteria come before
more general criteria.</p><p>That said, I'll not belabor rules too much here other than to
add that multiple options, some of which carry their own options,
can be strung together. But you do need to ensure that rules make
sense. For example, don't specify an output interface in an input
chain or that rule will never match anything. The syntax may allow
you to construct impossible rules, but it's not a good idea. If
you're in doubt about a particular rule, you can always make the
target a log target then send traffic that matches that rule to see
if it does in fact trigger. If you need a tool to test your rules,
take a look at SendIP
(<a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html" target="_self">www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d277e8"></a>Targets</h2></div></div><p>Netfilter has four built-in targets: ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE and
RETURN. The DROP target replaces ipchain's DENY target. All other
targets used are based on modules that load as a target. These
include REJECT, LOG, MARK, MASQUERADE, MIRROR, REDIRECT and TCPMSS.
Terminal targets, such as ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, MASQUERADE, MIRROR
and REDIRECT, terminate a chain. A LOG target does not terminate a
chain. LOG also neither ACCEPTS, REJECTS nor DROPS a packet, so the
chain continues to be traversed. Thus the ipchains -l option is now
another target but a nonterminating one. The rest of the chain will
be traversed until it hits the policy rule.</p><p>The policy rule is the overall rule for the chain. If your
FORWARD chain contains a policy of DROP, and no rules above match
in the chain, the packet will terminate when it hits the policy
rule. Your policy rule can only be one of the built-in targets. You
cannot have REJECT as a policy rule.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d27948"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>Before we look at examples, let's set some things up. Scripts
are nice, and one that runs from rc.local (wherever that is on your
system) is always good. So let's write an rc.iptables script as
part of our example to implement Netfilter during bootup (see
Listing 1). (Note: all iptables rules will start $IPT and should
continue unbroken to the end of the line, i.e., the next command.
Rules should not be broken on a line.)</p><p><a href="4815l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. rc.iptables
Script</a></p><p>We've set up some variables to start, stopped forwarding
traffic through the system, then inserted some modules. The
ip_tables module allows us to start writing rules. The ip_nat_ftp
module is necessary if we are using the NAT table to do SNAT or
MASQUERADE (covered below) to allow active FTP. The
ip_conntrack_ftp allows connection tracking of FTP. This module
automatically loads the ip_conntrack module because it is dependent
on ip_conntrack. If you don't need or want the ip_conntrack_ftp
module, but want to make sure your firewall does IP defragmentation
(a good idea), you can substitute ip_conntrack for
ip_conntrack_ftp. Let's continue with our script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for i in filter nat mangle
do
$IPT -t $i -F
$IPT -t $i -X
done
</pre><p>The above lines will flush (-F) all rules in the chain shown
as the argument to -F. Since no chain name was given as an
argument, -F will flush all chains. Note that this has to be done
for each table, hence the loop. If you aren't using a particular
table, you can delete it from the for statement. As each loop
starts, you will note that a new module has been loaded: first the
iptable_filter module, then the iptable_nat module and finally the
iptables_mangle module. If you remove mangle from the loop, the
iptables_mangle module will not be loaded. Unused modules can be
removed at your leisure.
</p><p>Under ipchains, you would have used something like</p><p>ipchains -F -X</p><p>to accomplish the same thing.</p><p>Before we continue, let's assume the following setup: a home
user and three systems that access the Internet through our
firewall/workstation PC. Access is via dial-up (ppp0). If your
setup is different, substitute your external interface for ppp0.
The systems are not offering any services outside their own
network, which is on eth0. We do, however, want all systems inside
to be able to surf the Web. For this first example, we'll assume a
dynamic IP from an outside ISP [see Listing 2, rc.iptables.dynamic,
at
<a href="../listings/089/4815.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue89/4815.tgz</a>].</p><p>Since our firewall PC is also a workstation, it will be
originating and terminating its own traffic. While not a good idea
for a firewall (these should be dedicated systems) on a home
network, we really don't need a dedicated firewall. With this in
mind, remember that one difference between iptables and ipchains is
in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains. In ipchains, packets
traversing the FORWARD chain came from INPUT and went through
FORWARD to OUTPUT, so we could locate our rules in the INPUT chain
and be safe for packets going to the FORWARD chain. The iptables
implementation only uses INPUT for the local system and FORWARD for
the other systems. In our case we need identical rules in each of
the FORWARD and INPUT chains. To prevent duplicating a lot of
rules, let's create a user chain called tcprules and call it from
both INPUT and FORWARD. Continuing our script then:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t filter -N tcprules
</pre><p>The ipchains equivalent of this rule would be the same,
excluding the -t filter option of the incantation:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -N tcprules
</pre>


Now a little Netfilter magic. We want to prevent someone from
connecting to our systems from the outside but permit connections
to the outside to be established by our users. The following rules
make use of Netfilter's stateful capability:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t filter -A tcprules -i ppp+ -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -t filter -A tcprules -i ! ppp+ -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
$IPT -t filter -A tcprules -i ppp+ -m state --state NEW,INVALID -j DROP
</pre>


If you want to do something similar in ipchains, the closest you
could come is to deny syn packets to the ppp+ interface:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -A input -i ppp+ ! -y -j DENY
</pre>


A couple of quick notes at this point. First, the &ldquo;!&rdquo; negates
whatever follows it. So <b  >! ppp+</b> is the same as
specifying all other interfaces (in the case of our home user, lo
and eth0). The &ldquo;+&rdquo; on the end of the ppp tells Netfilter this
rule applies to all ppp interfaces.
</p><p>As for the ESTABLISHED, RELATED, NEW and INVALID arguments,
they are more than they appear to be. ESTABLISHED permits traffic
to continue where it has seen traffic before in both directions.
ESTABLISHED obviously applies to TCP connections but also to UDP
traffic, such as DNS queries and traceroutes as well as ICMP pings.
In fact, packets are first checked to see if the connection exists
in the connection tracking table (/proc/net/ip_conntrack). If so,
the chains aren't run, the original rule is applied and the packets
pass. In some cases, Netfilter is faster than its predecessor
because of this check. The RELATED argument covers a multitude of
sins. This argument is applied to active FTP, which opens a related
connection on port 20, but also applies to ICMP traffic related to
the TCP connection. The NEW argument applies to packets with only
the SYN bit set (and the ACK bit unset). The INVALID applies to
packets that have invalid sets of options, as in an XMAS tree
scan.</p><p>The above rules permit the internal systems to pass new
connections internally and externally, but don't permit incoming
new or invalid packets.</p><p>Since we're going to be masquerading our network behind our
firewall, we'll need to set up a masquerading rule. This process is
very similar to the one used in ipchains. Assuming our internal
network is 192.168.0.0/24, we'll use the following rule:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp+ -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0/0 -j MASQUERADE
</pre><p>One difference ipchains users should note is the use of -o
ppp+ instead of -i ppp+. This is because with ipchains, we dealt
with interfaces as -i. With iptables, -i stands for input
interface, and -o stands for output interface. If you mistakenly
use -i ppp+ in the line above, no masquerading will take place. In
fact, the rule should never match at all.
</p><p>Let's finish our script by implementing the tcprules above
where they are needed, implementing our filter-table policies and
turning ip_forwarding back on:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t filter -A INPUT -j tcprules
$IPT -t filter -A FORWARD -j tcprules
$IPT -t filter -P INPUT DROP
$IPT -t filter -P FORWARD DROP
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>By default, the filter-table policies are all ACCEPT. Given
the stateful nature of Netfilter, this affords sufficient
protection, unlike ipchains. If you think about the stateful rules
we've implemented, you'll see that no harm should come with the
default policy; in fact, nothing should ever arrive at the default
policy. But some believe that it's always better to play it safe,
so we can drop anything not addressed already. Note that the policy
doesn't have a target per se, so we don't use -j. This is also why
only built-in targets can be policies&mdash;policies aren't really
targets. If you really want REJECT as your policy, you'll need to
add something like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t filter -A tcprules -i ppp+  -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreachable
</pre>


The above rule applies to all packets coming in on your ppp
interface. Make sure this rule is your last rule because nothing
will pass this rule.
</p><p>While you could make the rule</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -f filter -A tcprules -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreachable
</pre><p>you will find that your internal hosts are also blocked
because this rule will apply to all interfaces (something you
should keep in mind with policies as well).
</p><p>At this point, I should mention that, unlike ipchains, a
target match does not necessarily terminate a chain. For example,
if you use the following rule in tcprules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -t filter -I INPUT -p ICMP -m icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/minute -j LOG --log-prefix "ICMP-packet "
</pre><p>the next rule (which may or may not also match this packet)
will be processed. If a rule match does not drop, reject, accept or
queue the packet and is not a return, the chain will continue.
</p><p>The ipchains crowd will note that under iptables, LOG is a
target by itself rather than a simple -l option following the
target, as with ipchains. This permits some flexibility, as can be
seen from the above rule. The limit match prevents someone
malicious from flooding your logs. The LOG target can send a prefix
with its message so that it's easy to grep from the logs.</p><p>Before we move on, all ipchains users know you can view the
chains by using something like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -L -n
</pre><p>This will show you the chains. With Netfilter, we need to
look at the chains, table by table:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -L -n
iptables -t nat -L -n
iptables -t mangle -L -n
</pre>


You can add a -v to get even more information on each rule:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -L -nv
</pre>


Next is an example to demonstrate the new SNAT and DNAT. If you
understand the mangle table and its use, you probably don't need
this article and will be e-mailing me about any errors you've
noticed.
</p><p>In this example, we'll assume our home user has a broadband
connection and is using eth0 for the internal network and eth1 for
the external network. The script begins the same as before, but
when we get to the tcprules, we're going to do something a little
different. Here, we're going to assume the user has a static IP of
209.127.112.17, which gives us more leeway [see Listing 3,
rc.iptables.static, at
<a href="../listings/089/4815.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue89/4815.tgz</a>].
In fact, we can also assume the user has his own domain name and is
running his own e-mail server on port 25, which is located on an
internal system with IP 192.168.0.2 (the firewall is 192.168.0.1).
His DNS entry points to 209.127.112.17 as his mail server, as shown
in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="4815l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. DNS Entry for Mail
Server</a></p><p>The first two tcprules are the same as in the first example.
But before we drop all other connections, we accept connections on
port 25. Then, in the nat table, we take the port 25 connection and
forward it to another internal host on the same port. You can do
this for all your connections. Remember that if you do this forward
for DNS, you need to forward UDP as well as TCP. In fact, unless
someone outside is going to do zone transfers, you can drop the TCP
part and only pass UDP.</p><p>Notice that now, instead of using MASQUERADE as a target for
outgoing connections, we're using SNAT. In case you wondered, the S
stands for source, which is what is being changed. In the case of
DNAT, we changed the destination of the packet. The argument
--to-source can take a range of IPs, so your firewall can look like
several hosts. If you have five usable IPs from your ISP, you can
use all five as outgoing. Then you can point different services to
different IPs and have up to five systems behind your firewall
answering DNS queries, hosting web sites, accepting mail, etc.
Netfilter will also allow you to do rudimentary load balancing.
When a range of destinations is used with DNAT, the system with the
least number of connections (not necessarily the system with the
lightest load) gets the connection.</p><p>About the only other thing you may want to know to get
started is how to increase the maximum number of connections
tracked. This number is arrived at by default depending on the
amount of RAM your system has. However, the number is conservative
and can be increased. You can find this number this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max
</pre><p>On my system with 256MB of RAM, the number is 16376.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2e580.0x1d1f308"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2></div></div><p>Using Netfilter's stateful rules, you can actually increase
the security of your home system with less effort by making
judicious use of its connection tracking. Many more options are
also available to you. This article scratches only the surface. I
recommend you make use of Rusty's Unreliable Guides available on
the Netfilter site (mentioned earlier).</p><p>For home users with simple needs, keep your firewall simple.
I do not recommend most firewall tools and scripts because they
layer unnecessary complexity into your firewall. If you don't
understand a rule, don't implement it. The first three stateful
rules (using the -m state rule) will keep you in good stead. If an
attacker has already been in and compromised a system, the rules
won't help. They also won't protect you against e-mail-based
trojans, but they will protect against direct attacks. I suggest,
if you don't use IRC, you log and drop outgoing IRC
connections:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$IPT -j filter -I tcprules -p tcp --destination-port 6667 -j LOG --log-prefix "IRC attempt "
$IPT -j filter -I tcprules 2 -p tcp --destination-port 6667 -j DROP
</pre><p>Also, if you don't need anyone entering your network, don't
open any ports (as we did in our second example). This article did
not discuss how to segregate your network properly to isolate
internet-accessible systems from trusted internal systems. If you
require this level of complexity, and your risk assessment asks for
it, it might be time to call for knowledgeable help.
