    Hacking Linux Exposed deals with security-related threats
    to Linux systems.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4836c.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6558"></a></h2></div></div><p> Past months' Linux worms and the shell
server compromise of sourceforge.net, leading to the crack of
several open-source sites, have reminded us that not even Linux
systems are invulnerable to malevolent attackers. Three leading
computer security experts published <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking
Exposed</em></span> in 1999. The book is a thorough dissertation on
cracking and was followed up by a second edition in 2000. This year
George Kurtz, coauthor of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Exposed</em></span>,
teamed up with two leading Linux security experts to bring us
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Linux Exposed</em></span>.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Linux Exposed</em></span> deals with
security-related threats to Linux systems. It's a book for
practitioners by practitioners, with an emphasis on practice rather
than theory. The book provides an overview of various
security-related issues. To this end, it has been organized into
four parts. Each part deals with a distinct aspect of systems'
security and is in turn broken into several chapters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6818"></a>Contents</h2></div></div><p>Part I is the system administrator's inside view of systems'
security. It deals with how he or she can prevent the cracker from
intruding, starting with an examination of the basic security
features built into Linux. This is a look at users, groups, file
permissions, etc., from a security point of view. While this should
be old news to a systems administrator, this angle into the matter
may shed some new light on the topic. The authors then progress to
proactive measures and recovering from break-ins. Tools to both
search for system vulnerabilities in order to harden a Linux
installation and to reveal system compromises are dealt with. Part
I is rounded off with a chapter on how a cracker would go about
mapping and enumerating your systems in preparation for an
attack.</p><p>We can make our systems as secure as we want, but there will
always be methods of gaining what is considered legal access from
the system's point of view. Part II deals with how a cracker could
gain such access. Access may be gained in several ways, and the
important lesson here is that you can never be too paranoid.
Crackers will do anything to gain access, whether it is physical
access to your facilities or access through the network. Almost an
entire chapter is devoted to social engineering. Worms also receive
due attention.</p><p>Once malevolent users gain access to a system, their next
step will be to elevate their privileges. Local user attacks is the
topic of Part III. An entire chapter is dedicated to Linux password
systems. For those ever wondering about shadow passwords and PAM,
look no further. I particularly like that the authors target
attacks against poor programming in this part of the book. Part III
ends with an entire chapter on how the cracker can go about
maintaining access to an already compromised system. This chapter
is particularly useful as it can be read as an introduction to the
clues a cracker would leave behind on a compromised system.</p><p>While the compromise of a workstation may be bad enough, it
is far worse when a server is compromised. Servers play a far more
important role in an organization, and server downtime affects more
than a single individual. Part IV is devoted to the three major
services that Linux supports in both large farms and the kid's
bedroom&mdash;mail, FTP and Web. General security-related issues are
explored along with application-specific issues, including some of
the most popular server software like sendmail, postfix, WU-FTP and
more. Part IV concludes with a look at access control at the
network layer. Both local-access control through the inet
d&aelig;mon and TCP wrappers, as well as external-access control
with firewalls are discussed.</p><p>The fifth and final part consists of four appendices. The
first two appendices, &ldquo;Keeping Your Programs Current&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Turning Off Unneeded Services&rdquo;, contain distribution-specific
material. Appendix C deals with on-line resources, while the final
appendix provides case studies. The case studies are in-depth
descriptions of how three crackers have broken into
computers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6a80"></a>Presentation</h2></div></div><p>The book is both well structured and well written. It is
scattered with gems of computer-security wisdom. I especially like
the use of caution and note callouts to emphasize important issues.
Each chapter consists of a number of security-related threats to
Linux systems, ways to exploit a threat and existing
countermeasures. The use of sample scenarios helps clarify the
threat and often sheds additional light on the text.</p><p>As an aid to understanding the risks involved, all exploits
are accompanied by a risk rating. The risk rating is based on the
exploit's popularity, how hard it is to perform and the impact it
has on the target system. While such figures will always be
somewhat arbitrary&mdash;it's incredibly hard to come up with any good
and exhaustive metrics to measure such factors&mdash;the risk rating
provides an indication of the overall risk involved with a
security-related threat.</p><p>A book on computer security would never be complete without
descriptions of the tools involved. Both tools to exploit a
weakness and tools to fend off and guard oneself against hostile
attacks are covered on a per-threat basis. When dealing with the
tools, the authors are brief and to the point. This is, after all,
a book on computer security as a whole, not a tool tutorial.</p><p>I would have expected the authors to explain their use of the
term hacking, especially when writing for a Linux audience. We all
know how particular some of us are with the hacking vs. cracking
issue. In the authors' defense, it has to be said that the original
manuscript did contain a section on just this issue, but it was
deemed extraneous by the editor and removed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fe580.0x11f6c90"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Linux Exposed</em></span> is a good read and
a great introduction to computer security on the Linux platform.
More than that, it is a great reference work for the more
experienced systems administrator. As the authors fairly quickly
jump to rather technical material and assume some knowledge of both
networking and Linux systems, the book is not ideally suited for
the complete Linux neophyte. However, I am of the firm opinion that
for a freshman wanting to learn more, the book is perfectly suited
as a guide to further reading.</p><p>I'm not overly sure I'd recommend the book as a general
introduction for those completely new to computer security. For
that I'd recommend a book like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking
Exposed</em></span>, which is a better all-around introduction to
computer security. Don't let the two books' similarities in cover
and title fool you. There are major differences between them. The
problem with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Exposed</em></span> is that it's
somewhat lacking in the department of Linux-specific solutions.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Linux Exposed</em></span> amends this. The two
books should be considered complementary.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking Linux Exposed</em></span> is easy to read.
The authors have done a very good job of providing an overview of
security-related threats to the Linux platform and how best to
avoid falling prey to them. As such, I greatly recommend the book
to systems administrators and Linux users who want to learn more
about how to secure their systems.</p><p><a href="4836s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
