determining the operating system a remote host computer is running,
based on characteristics of the data returned from the remote host.
This can be as simple as connecting up to the host and reading a
service banner or as complex as statistical analysis of TCP initial
sequence numbers and flags. An outsider has the capability to
discover general information, such as which operating system a host
is running, by searching for OS-specific differences in
implementation of the TCP stack. In some cases, these differences
can reveal information as detailed as the OS version number and
processor architecture.
</p><p>By pinpointing the exact OS of a host, an attacker can launch
an educated and precise attack against a target machine. In a world
of buffer overflows, knowing the exact flavor of an OS and
architecture could be all the opportunity an attacker needs. By
using software such as Netfilter for Linux, an administrator can
evade accurate OS-fingerprinting methods and in some cases even
manipulate the results gathered by the external force. While these
practices should never be considered a sound security solution,
sometimes they can deter and even confuse a would-be attacker if
the host poses as an obscure network entity.</p><p>While fingerprint evasion does offer a nice layer of
obscurity as to the actual OS a host is running, it does not in any
way secure the host from various vulnerabilities. Security
practices and policies attempt to raise the level of skill required
to compromise the system, obscurity only attempts to mask the
actual target. Even if your system appears to be running Microsoft
IIS5 to the world, this won't protect you if you are running a
vulnerable version of let's say sendmail, and some script kiddy's
automated scanner attempts to exploit you. Fingerprint evasion is
meant to deter attacks, not prevent them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab46b8"></a>Techniques for Discovery</h2></div></div><p>Before attempting to dissuade a potential attacker through OS
deception, one must familiarize themselves with the tools and
methods used in fingerprinting an OS. The term &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; here is
used loosely and encompasses those who would attempt to fingerprint
a host or those who might have the intentions of doing the system
harm. Security has been, and in the writer's mind always will be, a
sequence of measure and counter-measure scenarios. By becoming
accustomed to the tools and methodologies available for this type
of attack you cannot only prepare and plan for current engagements,
but also gain insight into what the future may have in
store.</p><p>Several publicly available tools exist for attempting to
fingerprint an OS. Of these tools, one seems to be the popular
choice: nmap
(<a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html" target="_self">www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html</a>)
by Fyodor of Insecure.org. <span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span>
uses several techniques for attempting to determine the host
operating system from a network level, some of them primitive in
their approach and others more complex, requiring a good
understanding of the TCP/IP protocol and protocol standards. Of the
methods nmap incorporates, some of the most notable are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>FIN Probing&mdash;by sending a packet to an open port on
a host with nothing more than the FIN flag set in the packet, an
attacker can glean information from certain hosts that respond to
the requests. This behavior is non-RFC-compliant so it is a good
indicator of OS.</p></li><li><p>TCP ISN Sampling&mdash;TCP packet ISN (initial sequence
number) sampling can be a valuable way to determine and categorize
the remote host. By watching the ISNs for patterns an attacker can
make an educated guess as to the host OS.</p></li><li><p>ICMP Error Messaging&mdash;through the use of ICMP
(internet control message protocol) error messages, an attacker can
find useful information based on the host responses. Particular
areas of interest are the checksums, error message echo integrity
and TOS (type of service) fields in the reply packets.</p></li><li><p>TCP Options&mdash;perhaps the most revealing aspect of
any TCP stack is how it handles optional TCP flags and data. By
making specific requests to a host and varying window scales and
segment sizes, one can determine which operating system a host is
running based on its willingness to accept or respond with these
optional parameters.</p></li></ul></div><p>While all of these methods of OS fingerprinting are at the
packet level, great care should be taken to understand your system
at a service level. An attacker could sort and compare packet
structures but will often simply query a web server for the
&ldquo;Server&rdquo; field in the HTTP response header. Knowing which
services readily identify themselves, and more importantly the
operating system architecture, will show us other avenues that can
be used for remote information retrieval.
</p><p>Client modesty (or lack thereof) can be an excellent way to
glean information from a host as well. Unlike the other options,
this process can be completely passive. By watching how a client
application presents itself to a service, you can make a reasonable
guess at the operating system and possibly the architecture. Of
these clients, web browsers, e-mail clients and IRC (internet relay
chat) clients are most often the biggest offenders. If we were on
IRC and requested a CTCP version from a user, and received the
reply of &ldquo;mIRC32 v5.81 K.Mardam-Bey&rdquo;, we could make an educated
guess at this point that the host is running some form of the
Windows operating system.</p><p>Finally, there is exploit testing. While less tactful, it can
nevertheless be useful in discovering the operating system of a
host. By initiating a series of OS-specific denial-of-service
attacks an outsider can test to see if a host is vulnerable. This
can determine which rating system a host is running, usually down
to the patch level. The Windows community should be grateful that
Fyodor and the other fingerprinting-tool authors didn't decide to
incorporate this method into their usual slew of scanning
techniques.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab4ce8"></a>Why Fingerprint Evasion?</h2></div></div><p>If you have read up to this point, you are at least no doubt
a little curious as to why one would go to the trouble of OS
fingerprint evasion. Good question! I think the logic here varies
from person to person. Everyone has his or her own reasons for
wanting, or not wanting for that matter, operating system
obscurity.</p><p>For some, the extra layer of obscurity helps them feel fuzzy
and warm inside. Like the people who feel the need to remove the
issue banner from their Telnet login screens, but resort to Telnet
rather than SSH for remote access security (obscure, but
technically less secure). For others, the notion of operating
system obscurity at the network level allows them to fine-tune and
tweak their IDS (intrusion detection system) since they have a
fairly good idea not only of what should be coming into their
network, but also of what data should be leaving it (obscure,
cautious and hopefully secure). Some might even have a need for
security, where every network they plug in to is a potential
hostile network; and the more obscure their operating system is,
the bigger the window of opportunity they have to complete whatever
the task is at hand without being noticed (obscure, cautious,
secure and probably reading your e-mail). Finally, there are those
of us who do it for fun, because we can and because we get some
small kick out of being able to fool the unknown individuals around
us who persist on launching scans in our direction (yes, guilty as
charged).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab4e48"></a>Evasion</h2></div></div><p>Now it's time to try our luck at fingerprint evasion.
Familiar with some of the common techniques used in determining a
host's operating system, we can reverse engineer these concepts to
aid us in hiding our operating identities.</p><p>First, we need to make sure that all patches are in place and
the system is secured. As I stated before, obscurity should only be
entertained after security has been implemented. I'm sure some
would disagree here, relying solely upon obscurity for their means
to a secured system, but what good is obscurity if that script
kid33's automated script gains root on your machine tonight? I'm
willing to bet once he has root access, what flavor of Linux you
are running isn't on his or her list of things to figure
out.</p><p>Second, we need to observe our services. Do they match up
with the operating system we are hoping to pass ourselves off as
using? In most cases this isn't as much of a concern since most
UNIX environments share similar if not the same services. But if
you are hoping to present yourself as a Windows machine, or even a
Cisco router for that matter, it may not be to your advantage to
show up having IRCd running. Make an effort in matching up your
services with a suitable decoy host.</p><p>While we're on the subject of services, it is also a good
idea to begin greping through the source code of these services
looking for banners or common identifiers of the services. Some
subtle identifiers could be the supporting of ASP pages or web
content that is served compressed in gzip format. For most people
this will be a lot of work. Again, it's up to you to gauge what
level of obscurity and conformity with your new decoy host you are
trying to achieve.</p><p>Next, we need to look at how our host appears on a network
vs. how our decoy host should look on a network. To make this a
little bit easier I suggest studying already documented materials,
namely the current fingerprint files used by the tools themselves.
Time should be taken to note not just how your decoy host responds
to usual queries, but also what special flags it supports in TCP.
TCP flags are useful information for outsiders to determine what OS
you are running. The fingerprint files don't include all possible
responses a host might give, just simple techniques that work
reproducibly. Depending on what level of obscurity you hope to
achieve, it may be worth looking into fingerprint information not
used by nmap (OSPF, OOB, IPv6, etc.). Or the joy of thoroughness
could be outweighed by the sleepless nights you would spend
gathering this information.</p><p>Finally, a decision needs to be made. Are you crafty, or are
you paranoid? If you answer to the latter, then you most likely
want to continue by obfuscating your client software. As mentioned
above, a host's client software tends to give out all kinds of
information regarding the system, either directly or indirectly. In
our previous example an IRC client lists itself as being for Win32,
but there are also more subtle ways of determining a host, such as
reading the e-mail headers of outgoing mail. Once again, it all
comes down to how many sleepless nights you are willing to spend
before your system meets your criteria.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab5108"></a>Potential Problems</h2></div></div><p>OS fingerprint evasion is like any other aspect of security;
it takes planning, proper execution and most importantly,
understanding. If security policies are not properly implemented,
the system could be more vulnerable than if these policies were not
implemented at all.</p><p>Popularity gives way to recognition. In most realms of
software, popularity is a great thing; it brings attention to all
your hard work and determination. In the case of OS fingerprint
evasion, recognition works against you. If you are using a popular
tool or package, eventually vulnerabilities and particulars will be
discovered; this is inevitable. These same software-specific
identifiers will allow others to fingerprint your counter-measure
accurately rather than the operating system itself.</p><p>Most every OS attempts to make its TCP ISN sequencing random,
in attempt to thwart TCP hijacking and more complex attacks on the
system. If your chosen implementation of evasion attempts to alter
TCP initial sequence numbers, great care should be taken to ensure
you do not downgrade this functionality and put your host at risk
to these types of attacks.</p><p>As with any software package that makes it onto your system,
application security should be a primary concern. Part of the
evasion process is masking existing services; the other comes in
the form of code, which is meant to filter your traffic and mask
what you put on the wire. Great care should be taken to ensure that
the application produced for this task is secure through good
programming practices and rigorous testing. All it takes is one
poorly thought-out strcpy() to turn this asset quickly into a
liability.</p><p>One of the evasion tactics previously listed is to alter the
service banners of software that identifies itself. Be careful
because some add-on software packages actually use these same
banners to determine compatibility with the current system
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab5370"></a>Risk vs. Reward</h2></div></div><p>Having established that evasion does not mean security, we
need to look at another aspect of this process, namely performance.
Since a good evasion setup filters your traffic en masse, it is
feasible that system performance will suffer. Obviously if you have
a site that hosts web pages for 10,000 clients, performance is a
bigger issue than if you simply have a Linux box set up somewhere
for you and your friends to check e-mail and IRC. As an
administrator, you need to decide which is the bigger reward for
you (and your users), performance or privacy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab5478"></a>Proof of Concept</h2></div></div><p>To illustrate the feasibility and relative ease of
fingerprint evasion I have included a small sample user-space
application (OSFPE) for Linux, which makes use of the Netfilter
kernel modules [see Listing 1 at
<a href="../listings/089/4750.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue89/4750.tgz</a>].
Through the use of such software as Netfilter in Linux, OS
fingerprint evasion is becoming increasingly more efficient.
Similar modifications and applications are sprouting up all over
the place; in BSD it is possible to accomplish this task via
ipfilter and a moderate amount of code (during the time of this
writing ipfilter has been removed from the BSD CVS tree, sorry
guys). Windows users (who are by far at the biggest disadvantage in
this arena) are discovering ways to shim their TCP/IP
communications, and with the inception of Libpcap for Win32,
capture and forge their own packet responses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab55d8"></a>Netfilter at a Glance</h2></div></div><p>Netfilter, as stated by its author, is &ldquo;a framework for
packet mangling&rdquo;. Sounds fun, eh? Netfilter interfaces with the
Linux kernel (kernels 2.4.x and above to be exact) and registers
hooks for each protocol. If the proper rules are in place, these
hooks capture incoming or outgoing network traffic that match
specified rules. These packets are then processed and marked for
either NF_DROP to have the packet dropped, NF_ACCEPT to accept the
packet for normal processing on the stack or NF_QUEUE to have the
packet queued for manipulation in user space. If the packet gets
queued for manipulation in user space, the ip_queue driver places
it in a queue; it is then handled asynchronously by any
applications running in user space that have registered themselves
for these types of packets. When these applications pull the
packets from the queue they have the ability to manipulate, accept
and reject the packets. If the packets are accepted, they are
handed off to the next application running that has registered for
such a packet. If the packet is flagged for NF_DROP, the packet is
dropped and processing of that particular packet ceases. Through
the use of Netfilter, applications in user space essentially have
kernel-level control of network traffic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab56e0"></a>iptables</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> is an application
used to interface with Netfilter to set, view and remove a system's
current network filtering rules. I make mention of iptables here
because in developing the proof-of-concept code we felt it was a
better idea to introduce users to the iptables program for rule
administration rather than having the application handle them. This
will allow people to better understand what is going on with the
packet queuing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab5840"></a>What We Did</h2></div></div><p>By taking advantage of the Netfilter modules and iptables
rule administration program we were able to set up rules to capture
incoming UDP, TCP and ICMP packets. Based on the incoming packets
and the source host we either allow them to access the system
normally or craft responses to appear as a Windows host, as defined
in one of nmap's OS fingerprint entries. Here is the fingerprint we
were attempting to match, and a brief walk-through on how we
accomplished this goal:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TSeq(Class=TD|RI%gcd=1|2|3|4|5|8|A|14|1E|28|5A%SI=&lt;1F4)
T1(DF=Y%W=2017|16D0|860|869F%ACK=S++%Flags =AS%Ops=M|MNWNNT)
T2(Resp=Y%DF=N%W=0%ACK=S%Flags=AR%Ops=)
T3(Resp=Y%DF=Y%W=0%ACK=O%Flags=AR%Ops=)
T4(DF=N%W=0%ACK=S++|O%Flags=R%Ops=)
T5(DF=N%W=0%ACK=S++%Flags=AR%Ops=)
T6(DF=N%W=0%ACK=S++|O%Flags=R%Ops=)
T7(DF=N%W=0%ACK=S++%Flags=AR%Ops=)
PU(DF=N%TOS=0%IPLEN=38%RIPTL=148%RID=E%RIPCK=E%UCK =E%ULEN=134%DAT=E)
</pre><p>The first line states that we need to build a time dependent
(TD) TCP sequencing or one that has random increments (RI) equal
to, but not greater than, 0x1F4 (500). This was actually pretty
easy to accomplish, or match up I should say. First we grabbed the
incoming packet, took the TCP sequence number, generated a
psuedo-random number between 1 and 500 and added the values
together. This met both the random increment and greatest common
denominator (gcd) requirements for the fingerprint.
</p><p>Next we broke down all the various packet tests (T1-T7) and
created cases for them in our TCP handler. All of these are pretty
straightforward and simply dictate how the host should respond to
different types of packets to open and closed ports, the exact
tests and their parameters are covered more in-depth in Fyodor's
paper on remote OS detection.</p><p>Next we matched up our response for a UDP port-unreachable
query. What nmap does here is send a UDP packet to a closed port on
the host and wait for a response in the form of an ICMP
port-unreachable packet. ICMP port-unreachable packets simply tell
the querying host that the port to which they attempt to deliver a
UDP message failed because there is no listening UDP service on
that port. On some networks these messages never get sent back and
are dropped at the router. In order to conform to the fingerprint
we made an effort to send back what they were expecting.</p><p>Finally, as an extra little bonus we sent back Syn-Ack
packets to the host for specific ports on our host if they happen
to scan for these TCP ports as being open. Similarly, we sent back
no response for particular UDP ports that we want to appear to be
open on our host (as stated above, only closed UDP ports send back
a port-unreachable message). When the scan of our host is complete,
it should appear as though TCP ports 135 and 139 and UDP ports 135,
137 and 138 are open. If we attempt to fingerprint our host we
should match up with the above-listed fingerprint and get the
listing as &ldquo;Windows NT4 / Windows 95 / Windows 98&rdquo;.</p><p>As a final note, proof-of-concept code is just that, a little
piece of programming used to prove a point. Do yourself a favor and
don't run this on a critical device. Open it up, learn from it,
modify it, exploit it, but don't depend on it. I've made an attempt
to keep the code safe and somewhat readable (arguable), but I can't
promise anything.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29bc580.0x2ab5b58"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to Rex Warren for all his hard work aiding me with
