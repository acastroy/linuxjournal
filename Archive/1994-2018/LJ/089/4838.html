a look at this. The theme of this issue is security, and I have
developed a menu around that very theme. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi</em></span>?
But of course it is not about networks. Do you know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, what the most important part of running a
successful restaurant is? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bien s&ucirc;r</em></span>, a
well-stocked wine cellar is important&mdash;I agree with you, but I was
thinking about the food, Fran&ccedil;ois. You see, our guests, they
hunger for many things, and it is our duty as restaurateurs to make
sure that their taste buds are constantly stimulated in ways they
do not expect.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Qu'est-ce que tu dis</em></span>? Fran&ccedil;ois,
security is a many-faceted aspect of cooking with Linux. Network
security is but one such item, and everyone no doubt will be
thinking network security. By selecting different ingredients, we
keep the palate alert and refreshed. For instance, look at this
first item. You cannot deny its security implications and
yet&mdash;Fran&ccedil;ois, why are you not paying attention? Eh? Ah,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mais pardon</em></span>, I see our guests have arrived.
Please, everyone, sit down. I shall have Fran&ccedil;ois fetch some
wine <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! We have a 1998 Clos de Vougeot in the cellar
that I think will satisfy everyone's taste buds tonight and add a
special air of <span   class="emphasis"><em>je ne sais quoi</em></span>. A lovely
Burgundy, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>,
Fran&ccedil;ois. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>!</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois and I were discussing different ways to look
at the concept of security. When we cook with Linux, we have all
gotten used to thinking of &ldquo;security&rdquo; as network security but, as
a visit to Monsieur Roget and his famous thesaurus will tell you,
security can mean many other things. You will find words like bond,
debenture, deposit, bail, hostage, plight, authentication and
receipt, just to name a few. And what about the security you enjoy
in knowing that you make regular backups? You do make regular
backups, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Then, we have job security, the
kind of security you experience knowing you make regular backups. A
little joke, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>In all seriousness, losing a file can still happen, and what
if your last backup was last night or even two hours ago? Despite
good habits and a healthy attraction to job security, you still
have lost your file. What can you do? Common wisdom, as they say,
informs us that if we delete a file from our Linux systems, that is
all, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. It is gone forever. However,
that is only partially true. It is possible to bring back a file.
Observe.</p><p>On my test system, I have a small drive mounted on
/mnt/tinydrive. If I use the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
df /mnt/tinydrive
</pre><p>I get the following information:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hdd6   42913   9063    31634  22% /mnt/tinydrive
</pre>


I told you that it was small, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? On this
small drive, I created some directories and files. One file is
called cabernet, and it contains my family's Cabernet secrets.
Actually, it does not contain any such thing, but it sounds so
mysterious. Speaking of Cabernets, Fran&ccedil;ois has returned
with the Burgundy.
</p><p>Now, if I list this file, it shows up like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 marcel  wines  77 Jun 21 04:38 cabernet
</pre><p>At 77 bytes, you know the secret is elegant. Now, if I remove
this file with <b  >rm cabernet</b>, it is gone for good,
and it cannot be read. And yet, with a little perseverance and
luck, you can bring the file back as I will show you. It is
important to unmount the drive in question immediately (or shut
down if the file is on your root drive):
<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /mnt/tinydrive
</pre>


The more time that elapses (and consequently, the more data that
gets written to the disk) from the time you delete a file, the
slimmer your chances of recovering it completely.
</p><p>In order to attempt a rescue of the data in question, I use a
program called debugfs. Have no fear, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. You will find this command on your system. It is
part of the e2fsprogs package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# debugfs /dev/hdd6
debugfs 1.14, 9-Jan-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
debugfs:
</pre><p>If I type <b  >lsdel</b> at the debugfs prompt, I
will get a listing that looks something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
7665    0 100644  5248   6/  6 Thu Apr 19 18:05:30 2001
  32  500 100600 12288  12/ 12 Thu Jun 21 04:38:39 2001
 158  500 100644    78   1/  1 Thu Jun 21 04:38:39 2001
 157  500 100644    77   1/  1 Thu Jun 21 04:40:25 2001
</pre>


The first column is the file's inode. The second column is the UID
of the owner. Since my UID was 500, and my accidental deletion
occurred on Thursday the 21st, it is starting to look like my file
might be one of those listed. Furthermore, I recall that my file
was 77 bytes long. There are no filenames listed so as you can
imagine, the more details you know about the original file, the
better. Still at the debugfs: prompt, I enter the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
debugfs: dump &lt;157&gt; /home/marcel/cabs
</pre>


The 157 is the inode number, and /home/marcel/cabs is a file on
another (still) mounted filesystem. By using the dump command to
debugfs, I can redirect the contents of inode 157 to a new file
called cabs. Now, let us look at the results of this operation:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /home/marcel/cabs
Why try making fine Cabernets when you can buy them
from Henri's Fine Wines?
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais non</em></span>! The secret is out!
</p><p>Another tool you might find useful to restore those lost
files is a little program called recover. Written by Tom Pycke,
recover makes the whole process of trying to work your way through
what can be an incredibly long list of deleted inodes quite a bit
easier, one might say virtually painless. To get a copy of recover,
head on over to
<a href="http://recover.sourceforge.net/linux/recover" target="_self">recover.sourceforge.net/linux/recover</a>.
Download the latest source, then extract and build it. It is all
very easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf recover-1.3.tar.gz
cd recover-1.3
make
make install
</pre><p>To use the program, you can simply type
<b  >recover</b>, and it will scan for the various
filesystems available on your system. You can also have it start
with the appropriate filesystem by specifying it on the command
line. What follows is a question-and-answer session designed to
narrow down your deleted file without having to go through a huge
listing. The recover program massages the data for you. Here is an
example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# recover /dev/hdd6
Recover v1.3 by Tom Pycke &lt;Tom.Pycke@advalvas.be&gt;
Getting inodes (this can take some time)...
debugfs 1.14, 9-Jan-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
In what year did you delete the file? (eg. 1999): 2001
</pre>


The program then asks for the month followed by a date and time
range as well as a range of possible file sizes. When everything
had been answered, I received the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
=&gt; 158 78 JUN THU 21 4:38:39 2001
=&gt; 157 77 JUN THU 21 4:40:25 2001
2 inodes found. Where shall i dump them?
(directory):  /tmp
</pre>


The files will get named dump157 and dump158. All that is left is
to view their contents with <b  >cat</b>. On the off
chance that these may be binary files, it might make sense to use
the file command first.
</p><p>Security has another side as we well know (and as Monsieur
Roget figured out as well). We may be secure in the knowledge that
we can recover a deleted file from our ext2fs filesystem, but what
of the other side? What if the information in the file was of a
top-secret nature, and I did not want to risk having anyone ever
see this file again? What if I would rather have this file
disappear into some dark region completely inhospitable to proper
viticulture? There could be implications of international security
should this information get out.</p><p>If your system contains a recent version of the fileutils
package (which contains programs like cp, mv, etc.), the solution
is at hand. You will find a program called shred that will take
your file and, ahem, shred it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ shred secret_instructions
</pre><p>If I use the command as above, the file secret_instructions
will be secret indeed, but it will not be deleted. It will,
however, be scrambled, much like a well-whisked omelette. For the
truly security-conscious, it may be better to use this version of
the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ shred -z -u secret_instructions
</pre>


In addition to scrambling, the program will overwrite the file with
null characters (the -z flag), then remove it completely (-u). Your
secrets are safe, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.
</p><p>We started today's culinary exploration with a slight hint of
backups. Let us say then, that you archive your data to tapes
regularly (a very good idea&mdash;I must commend you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>). Those tapes are then moved safely to off-site
storage. You may well have backed up those secret files that you so
desperately wish to remove from your system. Let us pretend that I
have archived the /etc/profile file using tar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -cvf /tmp/profile.tar /etc/profile
</pre><p>That simple tar file is quite transparent:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ more /tmp/profile.tar
etc/profile01006440000000000000000000001163072353 262310117170
ustar  rootroot
# /etc/profile
</pre>


As you can see, the contents of the file or files that exist are
visible on the archive. But of course, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, I know that I could simply extract the files with
a little
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvf <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>.tar
</pre>


but I wish to illustrate a point. What if all our tar archives were
encrypted? This is the idea behind sectar, a secure extension to
GNU tar written by Brian Wagener and Katrina Illari. You can pick
up the latest sectar from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/star" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/star</a>.
</p><p>You will need two packages. One is a patched version of the
GNU tar release. The second is sectar. Start by extracting the tar
package and building it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf tar_sectar.tar.gz
cd tar-1.13
make
make install
</pre><p>This is almost identical to the original tar package you have
on your system, except for a very interesting option. If you type
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/bin/tar --help
</pre>


you will notice the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-e, --encrypt   filter the archive through encryptor
</pre>


Ah, the mystery...but to use this feature, you must first build the
sectar package. Using the latest source, I followed these steps:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf sectar-1.02.tar.gz
cd sectar-1.02
make
make install
</pre>


Using this newfound power of encryption, I will re-create my
top-secret archive:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -ecvf /tmp/profile.tar /etc/profile
The 256 bit key created is keyfile.993515072
</pre>


I can now take this keyfile (which is located in my working
directory) and save it to a diskette or secure location for the day
when I need to restore my file. If the keyfile is in place, then
extracting data from the tar file is a breeze. However, in the
absence of the keyfile, your information remains secret. When we
look through this archive again (<span   class="emphasis"><em>sans</em></span> keyfile
of course), what we see is garbled, unreadable and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>certainment</em></span> unprintable.
</p><p>Once again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the time, she is
late and we must all start thinking about going to our respective
homes. You too, Fran&ccedil;ois. But before you do, please refill
our guests' glasses. All this intrigue has no doubt done little to
slake their thirsts. Unlike Monsieur Bond, pour the wine gently,
neither stirred nor shaken. Wonderful. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>,
Fran&ccedil;ois.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, it has been a pleasure once
again to serve you here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Do
remember to join us again next time. Fran&ccedil;ois will have your
