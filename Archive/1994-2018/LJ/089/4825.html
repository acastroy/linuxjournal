    Which open-source license should I use for my software?

should I use for my software?</em></span>
</p><p>Anonymous</p><p>Okay, I'll admit it, I wrote this question myself because
I've been asked it so many times I wanted to see it answered in
print. As an attorney for open-source companies and projects, I am
often requested to select a license (or to bless my client's
selection) from among the OSI-approved, open-source licenses. (All
the licenses described here are listed on the OSI web site at
<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_self">www.opensource.org</a>).</p><p>The question puts the cart before the horse. What drives the
license selection process is the client's business strategy, and
not the other way around.</p><p>Do you intend to make money from licensing the software or
from providing ancillary services like installation and training?
There's nothing illegal about using a proprietary software license
if that's what your business model dictates. Of course, as an
advocate of open source, I'd try to convince you that there are
many advantages to nonproprietary business models&mdash;but the client
is the one to make the final decision.</p><p>What degree of freedom are you willing to grant to your
licensees to modify your software? There are open-source licenses
(e.g., BSD-type) that impose virtually no restrictions on
licensees; they can modify the licensed software and create
proprietary versions without restriction. There are other
open-source licenses (e.g., GPL-type, more typically known as
&ldquo;free software&rdquo; licenses) that require the licensee's
modifications to be licensed back under that same license; this
&ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; characteristic is an advantage if you want your
licensees to have to reciprocate if they benefit from your
contribution to the community. There are still other open-source
licenses (e.g., MPL-type) that impose an intermediate level of
freedom; modifications to individual files containing licensed code
must be licensed back, but new files that merely work with the
licensed code need not be.</p><p>Are you willing to grant warranties that the software will be
&ldquo;merchantable&rdquo; or &ldquo;fit for a particular purpose&rdquo;? If your
software is royalty-free, you probably can't afford a warranty. On
the other hand, you may want to charge for your open-source
software and use the profits to provide a warranty and other forms
of service.</p><p>Is your software so well known that the main asset you need
to protect is your trademark rather than your code? An excellent
example of this is Apache. Their license allows you to do almost
anything you want with the Apache code, but you'll have to change
the name. If you have a trademark to protect, make sure your
license contains appropriate terms relating to that.</p><p>Have you considered the possibility of dual licensing? The
owner of a copyright in a software program always has the option to
use multiple licenses. For example, you may want to license your
software under the GPL and simultaneously provide a proprietary
version for those of your customers who are afraid of the GPL's
inheritance features; that unreasonable fear can be treated as a
revenue opportunity.</p><p>Have you considered using different licenses for different
parts of your software? Client software might be distributed under
an MPL-like license, but server software might be distributed under
a proprietary license. That way, you could make money from the
bigger customers that will pay to license your server software and
simultaneously build a large customer base with free client
software.</p><p>Are you trying to protect the code itself or the standards
that are implemented using that software? A license like SISSL
allows anyone to develop modifications of licensed software as long
as the licensee complies with all requirements set out by a
standards body; a licensee who elects not to comply with the
specification must publish a royalty-free reference implementation
of the modifications so that the standard cannot be abducted by
another company.</p><p>If there are patents that relate to your software, you will
have to consider licensing your patents along with your code. You
may also want to retaliate against any licensee who takes your free
software and then turns around and sues you for patent
infringement. Various licenses on the OSI-approved license list
take different approaches to this problem. Some include a strong
retaliation clause, others a weaker version that may be less
threatening to customers with a large patent portfolio.</p><p>This is not an exhaustive list of considerations. You and
your attorney should understand your business situation thoroughly
before you decide on a license. Even after you answer these
questions, you will still need to decide whether to invest in the
attorney resources to create your own license or to have your
attorney modify an existing license to meet your needs. If you
choose to create your own license, your attorney will be able to
tailor your license to your unique business requirements. On the
other hand, modifications to an existing license may be sufficient.
Consult an attorney familiar with your business to advise
you.</p><p>Remember that your business objectives guide the choice of
license. Anyone who ignores your business needs and whose first
words to you are &ldquo;use this license&rdquo; is the wrong horse to push
your cart.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and to the law in your
jurisdiction. Even though an attorney wrote this article, the
information in this article must not be relied upon as a substitute
for obtaining specific legal advice from a licensed
attorney.</p></div></div>
