&ldquo;Algorithms in Africa&rdquo; by Wayne Marshall in the June 2001 issue.
This is a definite upgrade over the typical Linux success story.
Insightful, committed, poignant, experienced and informed, you
should consider Mr. Marshall's perspective as paradigmatic for
covering the emerging global presence of Linux. The principles and
values here have definite application to domains such as India
(where the FSF is opening a branch office), China (where the
government has adopted free software, if not political freedom, as
its own) and many other areas of the world such as Eastern Europe
and South America. Please keep us up to date on global development.
And thanks for a superb magazine.</p><p>&mdash;William G. McGrath</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a96240"></a>Hurrah for Us</h2></div></div><p>I just wanted to write to let you know that I've consistently
found <i  >Linux Journal</i> to have the highest
quality content in the magazines that cover Linux and technology. I
am constantly getting refresher courses, learning about new code
and projects, and generally getting fantastic info from your
publication.</p><p>I especially wanted to compliment you on your regular
sections: At the Forge, Cooking with Linux and Paranoid Penguin.
Much of the information is applicable to other *nix to boot, making
your publication one I keep around for a long time (much to the
consternation of my wife). Anyway, thanks folks, and keep up the
good work.</p><p>&mdash;Joe Heck</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a96450"></a>Unchecked Checker</h2></div></div><p>In the July 2001 <i  >LJ</i> article &ldquo;Debugging
Memory on Linux&rdquo;, I noticed that the open-source memory checker
I've been using was not listed in the article. The checker contains
a replacement malloc library plus patches for gcc. The gcc patches
wrap C++-like constructors around local variables and insert tests
before memory references. This allows checked programs to detect
memory overwrites of local variables and some global variables in
addition to malloced buffers, and the checking catches overwrites
as soon as they happen. You may freely mix object modules compiled
with and without checking. The checker also includes replacements
for mem* and str* routines and can detect invalid calls against
checked memory objects, even from modules compiled without bounds
checking.</p><p>There are links to the checker from the gcc extensions page
at
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/extensions.html" target="_self">gcc.gnu.org/extensions.html</a>.</p><p>&mdash;William Bader</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a966b8"></a>Proprietary Parity</h2></div></div><p>In your article &ldquo;Debugging Memory on Linux&rdquo; in the July
2001 issue of <i  >LJ</i>, you list Purify from
Rational as a proprietary tool. As far as I can tell from their web
site, they do not support Linux. Also, a while back I did talk to a
Rational salesperson who said they didn't have any plans to support
Linux. Do you know something else?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sorfa replies:</b></span> It looks like
you are right. At the time of writing the article (early this
year), there was a hint that Purify would be supported on Linux. I
assumed (wrongly) that by the time the article made it to press, it
would be available. It is a pity and I apologize for the incorrect
info. It looks like the only proprietary alternative is
Insure++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a968c8"></a>Certification Revisited</h2></div></div><p>I must respectfully disagree with Allan Hall in his letter of
the July 2001 issue. Certification per se is certainly no
substitute for experience, but it does show that a candidate at
least took the initiative to attend some classes, read some books
and pass some tests. It also usually requires putting a few hundred
dollars up front.</p><p>I don't see how one could give a certified candidate anything
but an edge over an uncertified one, experience levels in the two
being equal.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Cunningham</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a96a80"></a>MPlayer Magic</h2></div></div><p>Just want to write to let you know that Robin Rowe's article
&ldquo;MPEG-1 Movie Players&rdquo; (May 2001) was very helpful and also
convinced me to renew my subscription to <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I wanted to play movies on my new notebook and
had played with xanim before, but your recommendation of MPlayer
was great. It compiles, installs and works like a charm. Thanks
again.</p><p>&mdash;Chuck</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a96c38"></a>Kinder, Gentler CVS</h2></div></div><p>It's articles like &ldquo;CVS: an Introduction&rdquo; (July 2001 issue
of <i  >LJ</i>) that keep me subscribed to
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I've been doing basic RCS for
years and knew there had to be a better way. But let's face it, the
man page for CVS is a little overwhelming to the uninitiated. But
the day after reading the article, I was using CVS at work (the
magazine is opened on my desk to page 72 right now), and I'm
feeling much better about long-range management issues now. Keep
'em coming! So many thanks to you and Ralph Krause for putting this
together.</p><p>&mdash;John Evans</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a96e48"></a>Praise from the Source</h2></div></div><p>I just went through your article about Nessus in
<i  >LJ</i> (June 2001), and I just wanted to
congratulate you, both on the accuracy of what is being said, as
well as on the excellent step-by-step instructions you gave to
readers.</p><p>Just to illustrate how well you explained: I only received a
few installation-problem questions from (what seems to be) readers
of your article, while the mailing list gained about 100 new users
the two weeks after the release of <i  >LJ</i>. (And
congrats for not having taken the screenshots directly off
nessus.org, as so many persons do.) A very fine job indeed.</p><p>&mdash;Renaud Deraison The Nessus Project</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a970b0"></a>Think Again</h2></div></div><p>Choong Ng's review of Mandrake 8.0 in the August 2001 issue
gives a good overall picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the
release. However, he failed to mention one important issue. It
seems that the stock kernel shipped with Mandrake 8.0 will not work
with the PS/2 mouse pointer in many IBM ThinkPad laptops. On the
ThinkPad mailing list, some people have not even been able to
install Mandrake 8.0 because of this.</p><p>&mdash;Mendel Cooper</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x199e580.0x1a97210"></a>Errata</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Izzet Agoren's Kernel Korner (May
