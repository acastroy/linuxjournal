    One of David's pet peeves is security, or rather the lack of it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf04500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of my pet peeves is security or,
should I say, the lack of it. It's a near-universal phenomena. Out
of the box, most Linux distributions are about as wide open and
easy to subvert as the standard Windows box. And this shouldn't be
(though fortunately, it is changing). Anyone who connects to a
public network (the Internet) should be responsible for that system
and its use. We hold gun owners accountable for how their guns are
used. The same should hold true for computer owners. But
distribution makers should also help their customers in this
regard, and a poorly secured system is child's play to break into.
As evidence, a large number of script kiddies are teenagers. These
children commit DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks using
IRC bots. They won't be punished even as minors, but they can put
an internet commerce site out of business on a whim. All it would
take is a properly configured Linux firewall in most homes to
prevent this problem. And with the new Netfilter, it would be easy
to put something together. The biggest roadblock seems to be
educating users that they need this, lest their system be used for
nefarious purposes.

</p><p>I must say, up front, I am not a fan of Zope, and I was
unable to get FreePM running via Apache with the provided
instructions. Personally, I would have used Perl, PostgreSQL and
Apache. But people tend to program using tools they know, I guess.
That said, FreePM is more than worth a look for a medical practice.
It is extremely well done even if Zope overly complicates its
setup. It has support for everything a medical practice needs,
including a prescription database, accounting, patient records and
more, all well-tied together. Requires: Zope, Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf047c0"></a>Bugtrack:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.agstools.com/products/bt.html" target="_self">www.agstools.com/products/bt.html</a>
</p><p>Extremely easy to install and administer, this utility is
very lightweight. If you need a simple bug-tracking solution for
Linux or just about any platform, you might want to take a look at
this one. It is simple and easily customizable, and I always choose
simplicity. Who wants to read documents for days to get something
running? For that much effort, I could write the program myself.
Requires: a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, others with ODBC), Perl,
DBI module for the database, web server, web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf04978"></a>nPULSE:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.horsburgh.com" target="_self">http://www.horsburgh.com/</a>
</p><p>Another easy-to-install and use utility, this one allows you
to monitor your network through a web browser.
<span   class="bold"><b>nPULSE</b></span> relies on nmap to scan your
network for open ports to tell you if services are still running.
This means nPULSE doesn't rely on SNMP, but it also means you'll
have to adjust PortSentry or similar programs to account for the
&ldquo;scanning&rdquo; activity. However, you may want to modify the HTML
sources on this slightly. I find the black background with white
writing a bit difficult to read (but that may just be my monitor
resolution: 1280 &times; 1024, 16-bit color on a 19" screen).
Requires: nmap, Perl, Perl modules Net::SSLeay and Mail::Mailer,
OpenSSL (optional), Java (optional).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf04b88"></a>SendIP:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html" target="_self">www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html</a>
</p><p>This tool is a must-have for all firewall administrators.
Until the new iptables includes a check function, you'll need some
way to test your firewall. The SendIP utility will allow you to do
exactly that. You can send an IP packet (TCP, UDP) or an ICMP
packet spoofing the source address to see what happens on your
firewall. Works with IPv4 and IPv6, so you can test the iptables
IPv6 rules as well. Requires: glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf04d40"></a>Sentry Firewall CD:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.sentryfirewall.com" target="_self">http://www.sentryfirewall.com/</a>
</p><p>Now this is some CD. You boot from this CD, and with a few
preconfigured files on a floppy (on which you've flipped the
write-protect switch to read-only) you have a running firewall.
Everything is either burned onto the CD or is in memory. If by some
quirk, someone actually does manage to break in to this firewall,
all you need is a reboot. All files deposited by the attacker are
gone when the RAM re-initializes. This particular CD is based on
Slackware. So if you have an old system with two NICs that will
boot from the CD-ROM, you've got a firewall. Requires: system
capable of booting from a CD-ROM, a way to burn a CD-ROM ISO
image.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf04ef8"></a>File System Saint:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.insecure.dk" target="_self">http://www.insecure.dk/</a>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I like Tripwire. It was the first, but
it's certainly not the easiest thing to set up. What I dislike
about difficult things is not just that I'm lazy (I am), but
difficult often means someone, somewhere will misconfigure or
otherwise nullify all the good the program should do. This program
is fast and easy. Not necessarily better, but different. Requires:
Perl and Perl module Digest::MD5.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf050b0"></a>datedif:</h2></div></div><p>download only:

</p><p>This small C program will calculate the number of days
between any two dates. Granted, this has somewhat limited use, but
the author does present an example. It is most useful in scripts.
How many days until Christmas? Requires: glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe0c580.0xf05268"></a>motion:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://motion.technolust.cx" target="_self">http://motion.technolust.cx/</a>
</p><p>I like this little application. It was designed so that you
could connect a (surveillance) camera to your system, run
<span   class="bold"><b>motion</b></span>, and it would take pictures
each time the image changed. You can make a movie, even send an
e-mail. Yep, great for security. But I (ab)use it differently. I
connect my video camera after taking a home movie, let motion grab
frames every second. Then I load all the images into xv and delete
what I don't want and rename what I do want. Much faster and easier
than doing it manually&mdash;a lot of options. This is a keeper.
Requires: libjpeg, libmysqlclient, libz, libcrypt, libnsl, libm,
glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
