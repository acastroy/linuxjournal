    Do you have a burning need to build a simple web client and
    server pair? Here's why OpenSSL is for you.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The quickest and easiest way to secure a
TCP-based network application is with SSL. If you're working in C,
your best choice is probably to use OpenSSL
(<a href="http://www.openssl.org" target="_self">http://www.openssl.org/</a>).
OpenSSL is a free (BSD-style license) implementation of SSL/TLS
based on Eric Young's SSLeay package. Unfortunately, the
documentation and sample code distributed with OpenSSL leave
something to be desired. Where they exist, the manual pages are
pretty good, but they often miss the big picture, as manual pages
are intended as a reference, not a tutorial.
</p><p>The OpenSSL API is vast and complicated, so we won't attempt
to provide anything like complete coverage here. Rather, the idea
is to teach you enough to work effectively from the manual pages.
In this article, the first of two, we will build a simple web
client and server pair that demonstrate the basic features of
OpenSSL. In the second article, we will introduce a number of
advanced features, such as session resumption and client
authentication.</p><p>I assume that you're already familiar with SSL and HTTP, at
least at a conceptual level. If you're not, a good place to start
is with the RFCs (see Resources).</p><p>For space reasons, this article only includes excerpts from
the source code. The complete source code is available in
machine-readable format from the author's web site at
<a href="http://www.rtfm.com/openssl-examples" target="_self">http://www.rtfm.com/openssl-examples/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd377c0"></a>Programs</h2></div></div><p>Our client is a simple HTTPS (see RFC 2818) client. It
initiates an SSL connection to the server and then transmits an
HTTP request over that connection. It then waits for the response
from the server and prints it to the screen. This is a vastly
simplified version of the functionality found in programs like
fetch and cURL.</p><p>The server program is a simple HTTPS server. It waits for TCP
connections from clients. When it accepts one it negotiates an SSL
connection. Once the connection is negotiated, it reads the
client's HTTP request. It then transmits the HTTP response to the
client. Once the response is transmitted it closes the
connection.</p><p>Our first task is to set up a context object (an SSL_CTX).
This context object is then used to create a new connection object
for each new SSL connection. These connection objects are used to
do SSL handshakes, reads and writes.</p><p>This approach has two advantages. First, the context object
allows many structures to be initialized only once, improving
performance. In most applications, every SSL connection will use
the same keying material, certificate authority (CA) list, etc.
Rather than reloading this material for every connection, we simply
load it into the context object at program startup. When we wish to
create a new connection, we can simply point that connection to the
context object. The second advantage of having a single context
object is that it allows multiple SSL connections to share data,
such as the SSL session cache used for session resumption. Context
initialization consists of four primary tasks, all performed by the
initialize_ctx() function, shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4822l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
initialize_ctx()</a></p><p>Before OpenSSL can be used for anything, the library as a
whole must be initialized. This is accomplished with
SSL_library_init(), which primarily loads up the algorithms that
OpenSSL will be using. If we want good reporting of errors, we also
need to load the error strings using SSL_load_error_strings().
Otherwise, we won't be able to map OpenSSL errors to
strings.</p><p>We also create an object to be used as an error-printing
context. OpenSSL uses an abstraction called a BIO object for input
and output. This allows the programmer to use the same functions
for different kinds of I/O channels (sockets, terminal, memory
buffers, etc.) merely by using different kinds of BIO objects. In
this case we create a BIO object attached to stderr to be used for
printing errors.</p><p>If you're writing a server or a client that is able to
perform client authentication, you'll need to load your own
public/private key pair and the associated certificate. The
certificate is stored in the clear and is loaded together with the
CA certificates forming the certificate chain using
SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(). SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file()
is used to load the private key. For security reasons, the private
key is usually encrypted under a password. If it is, the password
callback (set using SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb()) will be called
to obtain the password.</p><p>If you're going to be authenticating the host to which you're
connected, OpenSSL needs to know what CAs you trust. The
SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() call is used to load the
CAs.</p><p>In order to have good security, SSL needs a good source of
strong random numbers. In general, it's the responsibility of the
application to supply some seed material for the random number
generator (RNG). However, OpenSSL automatically uses /dev/urandom
to seed the RNG, if it is available. Because /dev/urandom is
standard on Linux, we don't have to do anything for this, which is
convenient because gathering random numbers is tricky and easy to
screw up. Note that if you're on a system other than Linux, you may
get an error at some point because the random number generator is
unseeded. OpenSSL's rand(3) manual page provides more
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37c38"></a>The Client</h2></div></div><p>Once the client has initialized the SSL context, it's ready
to connect to the server. OpenSSL requires us to create a TCP
connection between client and server on our own and then use the
TCP socket to create an SSL socket. For convenience, we've isolated
the creation of the TCP connection to the tcp_connect() function
(which is not shown here but is available in the downloadable
source).</p><p>Once the TCP connection has been created, we create an SSL
object to handle the connection. This object needs to be attached
to the socket. Note that we don't directly attach the SSL object to
the socket. Rather, we create a BIO object using the socket and
then attach the SSL object to the BIO.</p><p>This abstraction layer allows you to use OpenSSL over
channels other than sockets, provided you have an appropriate BIO.
For instance, one of the OpenSSL test programs connects an SSL
client and server purely through memory buffers. A more practical
use would be to support some protocol that can't be accessed via
sockets. For instance, you could run SSL over a serial line.</p><p>The first step in an SSL connection is to perform the SSL
handshake. The handshake authenticates the server (and optionally
the client) and establishes the keying material that will be used
to protect the rest of the traffic. The SSL_connect() call is used
to perform the SSL handshake. Because we're using blocking sockets,
SSL_connect() will not return until the handshake is completed or
an error has been detected. SSL_connect() returns 1 for success and
0 or negative for an error. This call is shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* Connect the TCP socket*/
sock=tcp_connect(host,port);
/* Connect the SSL socket */
ssl=SSL_new(ctx);
sbio=BIO_new_socket(sock,BIO_NOCLOSE);
SSL_set_bio(ssl,sbio,sbio);
if(SSL_connect(ssl)&lt;=0)
  berr_exit("SSL connect error");
if(require_server_auth)
  check_cert(ssl,host);
</pre><p>When we initiate an SSL connection to a server, we need to
check the server's certificate chain. OpenSSL does some of the
checks for us, but unfortunately others are application specific,
and so we have to do those ourselves. The primary test that our
sample application does is to check the server identity. This check
is performed by the check_cert function, shown in Listing 2.
</p><p><a href="4822l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. check_cert()
Function</a></p><p>Once you've established that the server's certificate chain
is valid, you need to verify that the certificate you're looking at
matches the identity that you expect the server to have. In most
cases, this means that the server's DNS name appears in the
certificate, either in the Common Name field of the Subject Name or
in a certificate extension. Although each protocol has slightly
different rules for verifying the server's identity, RFC 2818
contains the rules for HTTP over SSL/TLS. Following RFC 2818 is
generally a good idea unless you have some explicit reason to do
otherwise.</p><p>Because most certificates still contain the domain name in
the Common Name field rather than in an extension, we show only the
Common Name check. We simply extract the server's certificate using
SSL_get_peer_certificate() and then compare the common name to the
hostname we're connecting to. If they don't match, something is
wrong and we exit.</p><p>Before version 0.9.5, OpenSSL was subject to a certificate
extension attack. To understand this, consider the case where a
server authenticates with a certificate signed by Bob, as shown in
Figure 1. Bob isn't one of your CAs, but his certificate is signed
by a CA you trust.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4822f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An Extended Certificate Chain
</p></div></div><p>If you accept this certificate you're going to be in a lot of
trouble. The fact that the CA signed Bob's certificate means that
the CA believes that it has verified Bob's identity, not that Bob
can be trusted. If you know that you want to do business with Bob,
that's fine, but it's not very useful if you want to do business
with Alice, and Bob (of whom you've never heard) is vouching for
Alice.</p><p>Originally, the only way to protect yourself against this
sort of attack was to restrict the length of certificate chains so
that you knew that the certificate you were looking at was signed
by the CA. The X.509 version 3 contains a way for a CA to label
certain certificates as other CAs. This permits a CA to have a
single root that then certifies a bunch of subsidiary CAs.</p><p>Modern versions of OpenSSL (0.9.5 and later) check these
extensions, so you're automatically protected against extension
attacks whether or not you check chain length. Versions prior to
0.9.5 do not check the extensions at all, so you have to enforce
the chain length if using an older version. 0.9.5 has some problems
with checking, so if you're using 0.9.5, you should probably
upgrade. The #ifdefed code in initialize_ctx() provides
chain-length checking with older versions. We use the
SSL_CTX_set_verify_depth() to force OpenSSL to check the chain
length. In summary, it's highly advisable to upgrade to 0.9.6,
particularly because longer (but properly constructed) chains are
becoming more popular. The absolute latest (and best) version of
OpenSSL is .0.9.66.</p><p>We use the code shown in Listing 3 to write the HTTP request.
For demonstration purposes, we use a more-or-less hardwired HTTP
request found in the REQUEST_TEMPLATE variable. Because the machine
to which we're connecting may change, we do need to fill in the
Host header. This is done using snprintf(). We then use SSL_write()
to send the data to the server. SSL_write()'s API is more or less
the same as write(), except that we pass in the SSL object instead
of the file descriptor.</p><p><a href="4822l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Writing the HTTP
Request</a></p><p>Experienced TCP programmers will notice that instead of
looping around the write, we throw an error if the return value
doesn't equal the value we're trying to write. In blocking mode,
SSL_write() semantics are all or nothing; the call won't return
until all the data is written or an error occurs, whereas write()
may only write part of the data. The SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE
flag (not used here) enables partial writes, in which case you'd
need to loop.</p><p>In old-style HTTP/1.0, the server transmits its response and
then closes the connection. In later versions, persistent
connections that allow multiple sequential transactions on the same
connection were introduced. For convenience and simplicity we will
not use persistent connections. We omit the header that allows
them, causing the server to use a connection close to signal the
end of the response. Operationally, this means that we can keep
reading until we get an end of file, which simplifies matters
considerably.</p><p>OpenSSL uses the SSL_read() API call to read data, as shown
in Listing 4. As with read(), we simply choose an appropriate-sized
buffer and pass it to SSL_read(). Note that the buffer size isn't
really that important here. The semantics of SSL_read(), like the
semantics of read(), are that it returns the data available, even
if it's less than the requested amount. On the other hand, if no
data is available, then the call to read blocks.</p><p><a href="4822l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Reading the
Response</a></p><p>The choice of BUFSIZZ, then, is basically a performance
trade-off. The trade-off is quite different here from when we're
simply reading from normal sockets. In that case, each call to
read() requires a context switch into the kernel. Because context
switches are expensive, programmers try to use large buffers to
reduce them. However, when we're using SSL the number of calls to
read(), and hence context switches, is largely determined by the
number of records the data was written in rather than the number of
calls to SSL_read().</p><p>For instance, if the client wrote a 1000-byte record and we
call SSL_read() in chunks of 1 byte, then the first call to
SSL_read() will result in the record being read in, and the rest of
the calls will just read it out of the SSL buffer. Thus, the choice
of buffer size is less significant when we're using SSL than with
normal sockets. If the data were written in a series of small
records, you might want to read all of them at once with a single
call to read(). OpenSSL provides a flag, SSL_CTRL_SET_READ_AHEAD,
that turns on this behavior.</p><p>Note the use of the switch on the return value of
SSL_get_error(). The convention with normal sockets is that any
negative number (typically -1) indicates failure, and that one then
checks errno to determine what actually happened. Obviously errno
won't work here because that only shows system errors, and we'd
like to be able to act on SSL errors. Also, errno requires careful
programming in order to be threadsafe.</p><p>Instead of errno, OpenSSL provides the SSL_get_error() call.
This call lets us examine the return value and figure out whether
an error occurred and what it was. If the return value was
positive, we've read some data, and we simply write it to the
screen. A real client would parse the HTTP response and either
display the data (e.g., a web page) or save it to disk. However,
none of this is interesting as far as OpenSSL is concerned, so we
won't show any of it here.</p><p>If the return value was zero, this does not mean that there
was no data available. In that case, we would have blocked, as
discussed above. Rather, it means that the socket is closed, and
there never will be any data available to read. Thus, we exit the
loop.</p><p>If the return value was something negative, then some kind of
error occurred. There are two kinds of errors we're concerned with:
ordinary errors and premature closes. We use the SSL_get_error()
call to determine which kind of error we have. Error handling in
our client is pretty primitive, so with most errors we simply call
berr_exit() to print an error message and exit. Premature closes
have to be handled specially.</p><p>TCP uses a FIN segment to indicate that the sender has sent
all of its data. SSL version 2 simply allowed either side to send a
TCP FIN to terminate the SSL connection. This allowed for a
truncation attack; the attacker could make it appear that a message
was shorter than it was simply by forging a TCP FIN. Unless the
victim had some other way of knowing what message length to expect,
he or she would simply believe the length was correct.</p><p>In order to prevent this security problem, SSLv3 introduced a
&ldquo;close_notify&rdquo; alert. The close_notify is an SSL message (and
therefore secured) but is not part of the data stream itself and so
is not seen by the application. No data may be transmitted after
the close_notify is sent.</p><p>Thus, when SSL_read() returns 0 to indicate that the socket
has been closed, this really means that the close_notify has been
received. If the client receives a FIN before receiving a
close_notify, SSL_read() will return with an error. This condition
is called a premature close.</p><p>A na&iuml;ve client might decide to report an error and exit
whenever it received a premature close. This is the behavior that
is implied by the SSLv3 specification. Unfortunately, sending
premature closes is a rather common error, particularly common with
clients. Thus, unless you want to be reporting errors all the time,
you often have to ignore premature closes. Our code splits the
difference. It reports the premature close on stderr but doesn't
exit with an error.</p><p>If we read the response without any errors, then we need to
send our own close_notify to the server. This is done using the
SSL_shutdown() API call. We'll cover SSL_shutdown() more completely
when we talk about the server, but the general idea is simple: it
returns 1 for a complete shutdown, 0 for an incomplete shutdown and
-1 for an error. Since we've already received the server's
close_notify, about the only thing that can go wrong is that we
have trouble sending our close_notify. Otherwise SSL_shutdown()
will succeed (returning 1).</p><p>Finally, we need to destroy the various objects we've
allocated. Since this program is about to exit, thus freeing the
objects, this isn't strictly necessary, but it would be in a more
general program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd38a50"></a>Server</h2></div></div><p>Our web server is mainly a mirror of the client but with a
few twists. First, we fork() in order to let the server handle
multiple clients. Second, we use OpenSSL's BIO APIs to read the
client's request one line at a time, as well as to do buffered
writes to the client. Finally, the server closure sequence is more
complicated.</p><p>On Linux, the simplest way to write a server that can handle
multiple clients is to create a new server process for each client
that connects. We do that by calling fork() after accept() returns.
Each new process executes independently and just exits when it's
finished serving the client. Although this approach can be quite
slow on busy web servers it's perfectly acceptable here. The main
server accept loop is shown in Listing 5.</p><p><a href="4822l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Server Accept
Loop</a></p><p>After forking and creating the SSL object, the server calls
SSL_accept(), which causes OpenSSL to perform the server side of
the SSL handshake. As with SSL_connect(), because we're using
blocking sockets, SSL_accept() will block until the entire
handshake has completed. Thus, the only situation in which
SSL_accept() will return is when the handshake has completed or an
error has been detected. SSL_accept() returns 1 for success and 0
or negative for error.</p><p>OpenSSL's BIO objects are stackable to some extent. Thus, we
can wrap an SSL object in a BIO (the ssl_bio object) and then wrap
that BIO in a buffered BIO object, as shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
io=BIO_new(BIO_f_buffer());
ssl_bio=BIO_new(BIO_f_ssl());
BIO_set_ssl(ssl_bio,ssl,BIO_CLOSE);
BIO_push(io,ssl_bio);
</pre><p>This allows us to perform buffered reads and writes on the
SSL connection by using the BIO_* functions on the new io object.
At this point you might ask, why is this good? Primarily, it's a
matter of programming convenience. It lets the programmer work in
natural units (lines and characters) rather than SSL records.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd2f650"></a>Request</h2></div></div><p>An HTTP request consists of a request line followed by a
bunch of header lines and an optional body. The end of the header
lines is indicated by a blank line (i.e., a pair of CRLFs, though
sometimes broken clients will send a pair of LFs instead). The most
convenient way to read the request line and headers is to read one
line at a time until you see a blank line. We can do this using the
OpenSSL_BIO_gets() call, as shown in Listing 6.</p><p><a href="4822l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Reading the
Request</a></p><p>The BIO_gets() call behaves analogously to the stdio fgets()
call. It takes an arbitrary-sized buffer and a length and reads a
line from the SSL connection into that buffer. The result is always
null terminated (but includes the terminating LF). Thus, we simply
read one line at a time until we get a line that consists of simply
an LF or a CRLF.</p><p>Because we use a fixed-length buffer, it is possible, though
unlikely, that we will get a line that's too long. In that event,
the long line will be split over two lines. In the extremely
unlikely event that the split happens right before the CRLF, the
next line we read will consist of only the CRLF from the previous
line. In this case we'll be fooled into thinking that the headers
have finished prematurely. A real web server would check for this
case, but it's not worth doing here. Note that no matter what the
incoming line length is, there's no chance of a buffer overrun. All
that can happen is that we'll misparse the headers.</p><p>Note that we really don't do anything with the HTTP request.
We just read it and discard it. A real implementation would read
the request line and the headers, figure out if there was a body
and read that too.</p><p>The next step is to write the HTTP response and close the
connection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if((r=BIO_puts
  (io,"HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\r\\n"))&lt;0)
  err_exit("Write error");
if((r=BIO_puts
  (io,"Server: EKRServer\\r\\n\\r\\n"))&lt;0)
  err_exit("Write error");
if((r=BIO_puts
  (io,"Server test page\\r\\n"))&lt;0)
  err_exit("Write error");
if((r=BIO_flush(io))&lt;0)
  err_exit("Error flushing BIO");
</pre><p>Note that we're using BIO_puts() instead of SSL_write(). This
allows us to write the response one line at a time but have the
entire response written as a single SSL record. This is important
because the cost of preparing an SSL record for transmission
(computing the integrity check and encrypting it) is quite
significant. Thus, it's a good idea to make the records as large as
possible.
</p><p>It's worth noting a couple of subtleties about using this
kind of buffered write. First, you need to flush the buffer before
you close. The SSL object has no knowledge that you've layered a
BIO on top of it, so if you destroy the SSL connection you'll just
leave the last chunk of data sitting in the buffer. The BIO_flush()
call takes care of this. Also, by default, OpenSSL uses a 1024-byte
buffer size for buffered BIOs. Because SSL records can be up to
16KB long, using a 1024-byte buffer can cause excessive
fragmentation (and hence lower performance). You can use the
BIO_ctrl() API to increase the buffer size.</p><p>Once we've finished transmitting the response, we need to
send our close_notify. As before, this is done using
SSL_shutdown(). Unfortunately, things get a bit trickier when the
server closes first. Our first call to SSL_shutdown() sends the
close_notify but doesn't look for it on the other side. Thus, it
returns immediately but with a value of 0, indicating that the
closure sequence isn't finished. It's then the application's
responsibility to call SSL_shutdown() again.</p><p>It's possible to have two attitudes here. We could decide
we've seen all of the HTTP request that we care about. We're not
interested in anything else. Hence, we don't care whether the
client sends a close_notify or not. Alternatively, we strictly obey
the protocol and expect others to as well. Thus, we require a
close_notify.</p><p>If we have the first attitude then life is simple. We call
SSL_shutdown() to send our close_notify and then exit right away,
regardless of whether the client has sent one or not. If we take
the second attitude (which our sample server does), then life is
more complicated because clients often don't behave
correctly.</p><p>The first problem we face is that clients often don't send
close_notifys all. In fact, some clients close the connection as
soon as they've read the entire HTTP response (some versions of IE
do this). When we send our close_notify, the other side may send a
TCP RST segment, in which case the program will catch a SIGPIPE. We
install a dummy SIGPIPE handler in initialize_ctx() to protect
against this problem.</p><p>The second problem we face is that the client may not send a
close_notify immediately in response to our close_notify. Some
versions of Netscape require you to send a TCP FIN first. Thus, we
call shutdown(s,1) before we call SSL_shutdown() the second time.
When called with a &ldquo;how&rdquo; argument of 1, shutdown() sends a FIN
but leaves the socket open for reading. The code to do the server
shutdown is shown in Listing 7.</p><p><a href="4822l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7. Calling
SSL_shutdown()</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd2fcd8"></a>What's Missing</h2></div></div><p>In this article, we've only scratched the surface of the
issues involved with using OpenSSL. Here's a (nonexhaustive) list
of additional issues.</p><p>A more sophisticated approach to checking server certificates
against the server hostname is to use the X.509 subjectAltName
extension. In order to make this check, you would need to extract
this extension from the certificate and then check it against the

hostnames against wild-carded names in certificates.</p><p>Note that these applications handle errors simply by exiting
with an error. A real application would, of course, be able to
recognize errors and signal them to the user or some audit log
rather than just exiting.</p><p>In the next article, we'll be discussing a number of advanced
