    For both convenience and flexibility, xdm offers a useful way to
    manage X sessions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever wanted to access your
workstation's desktop remotely? How about accessing your desktop on
a server machine? That's just the sort of problem I needed to solve
recently. I was responsible for setting up and managing a group of
Linux servers. By the fifth trip to the lab to access a GUI console
for various reasons (badge access, key codes, flights of stairs,
etc.), it was time to find a solution that would allow me to use my
workstation to access X desktops on various server machines.
</p><p>Some may think that the standard X tools used to handle
remote sessions would be sufficient to solve my problem&mdash;something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet host1
export DISPLAY=mywkstn:0
gnome-session
</pre><p>(or some other session manager).
</p><p>However, the solution I was looking for needed to provide
more than just basic functionality. It needed to be more
administrable, appear more automatic and be easier to use for
developers new to Linux. There are pitfalls associated with
authentication, session management, etc., that require some
knowledge of the way X works. For example, I often forget to type
<b  >xhost +host1</b> when using remote X clients. I also
have been on the receiving end of a puzzled look when trying to
explain the xhost authentication scheme to a Linux newbie. Since
this development project was not the time to teach developers the
basics of X, I was looking for a solution that fulfilled all of
these requirements.</p><p>A couple of solutions would allow me to manage the X sessions
more easily. The solution I chose for this project was the X
display manager, or xdm, although another popular solution is vnc.
I chose xdm over vnc for two reasons. First, vnc has a server-side
requirement to have a d&aelig;mon running for each shared desktop.
Second, I already had X server software installed on all of the
workstations and didn't see the need to install additional client
software. Other choices are kdm and gdm, part of the KDE and GNOME
packages, respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272e768"></a>X Basics</h2></div></div><p>X is the graphical support system used in most UNIX
environments. If you are using GNOME or KDE on your Linux desktop,
then you are making use of the X Window System. It is defined and
maintained by the X Consortium
(<a href="http://www.X.org" target="_self">www.X.org</a>). Most Linux users
use an implementation of the X Window System offered by the XFree86
Project
(<a href="http://www.xfree86.org" target="_self">www.xfree86.org</a>).
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> is a display manager that
enables flexible session management functionality. While xdm is
usually thought of as &ldquo;that GUI logon screen that auto-starts my X
stuff&rdquo;, it is actually much more powerful, as we will see.</p><p>In the X world, the terms client and server can get a little
confusing. Specifically, an X server is the application that
controls the keyboard, mouse and display resources. A client is an
application that makes requests for the server to perform actions
on its behalf (i.e., display a window with some set of specified
characteristics). This is a little different for those of us used
to thinking of applications running on our workstations as
clients.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> uses the X Consortium's
X display manager control protocol, XDMCP, to communicate with the
X servers. This allows X servers to obtain session services from
servers running xdm. Three types of queries can be sent by X
servers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Direct&mdash;asks the named host directly to display a
login screen.</p></li><li><p>Broadcast&mdash;broadcasts a message to all hosts on the
network, and the first to answer offers the login-processing
services.</p></li><li><p>Indirect&mdash;contacts a named host running xdm and
asks it about known hosts with which it may communicate. The xdm
server will present a list of available servers willing to manage
an X session. The X server will eventually end up communicating
directly with the selected host to obtain login-processing
services.</p></li></ul></div><p>One of the initial reasons xdm was created was to allow for
management of X terminals. These devices are basically a display,
keyboard and mouse with embedded X server software; all
intelligence is located on a server in the network.
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> was used to push login screens
and manage sessions for these devices. Several years ago these
devices were popular because access to UNIX workstations was
limited. Users who wanted to access graphical desktops at their
desks were either lucky enough to have a UNIX workstation at their
desk or required one of these devices. Lately these devices have
become less popular and are being replaced by PCs running X server
software, such as Linux and other Unices (Solaris x86, xBSD, etc.)
or Windows (running Hummingbird Exceed or the like).
</p><p>When using xdm to manage these X sessions there are some
configuration gotchas. At first glance, it may appear that if you
configure xdm (in order to take advantage of XDMCP), you get either
a local X server started (i.e., the console goes into graphical
mode when xdm starts) or, if you disable the local display in xdm
and use startx, it doesn't give you access to the chooser. The
configuration described here allows any XDMCP client to access the
Linux server desktops (subject to X security provisions, of
course). It also demonstrates one way to configure xdm in order to
get both a local X desktop and access to other server desktops from
the workstation.</p><p>Security and access control are managed by xdm but are beyond
the scope of this article. <span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>
should only be used in controlled environments. In addition,
incoming port 177 should be blocked on all firewalls. If you're
interested in X security issues, the following man pages are a good
place to start: xdm(1), xauth(1), Xsecurity(7), lbxproxy(1)--Low
Bandwidth X proxy, xfwp(1)--X Firewall Proxy, and ssh(1) and
sshd(8) man pages, specifically regarding X11 port
forwarding.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272eea0"></a>Configuring xdm</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> is highly configurable;
the following is only one way to configure it in order to
accomplish a specific goal.</p><p>On my Red Hat 7 system, xdm lives in /etc/X11/xdm. Its main
configuration file is xdm-config (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4720l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. xdm-config</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>'s configuration files
are in X resource format. There are resources for the configuration
of the locations of various files. We are interested in the files
pointed to by the resources servers, accessFile and resources. The
adventurous will be interested in the session and
DisplayManager._<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>.setup, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is the display number.</p><p>Notice that DisplayManager.requestPort:0 is commented out.
This resource specifies which UDP port to use to listen for XDMCP
requests. If it is set to 0 (as is the default), then XDMCP
requests are ignored, and xdm only manages local displays (see
Xservers file). We comment it out so that xdm will listen on the
default port (USP port 177).</p><p>My Xservers file looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X
</pre><p>If this line were not commented out, then I would get a
graphical login screen every time I started xdm. That is, it would
start and manage a local X server on display 0 by running the
command <b  >/usr/X11R6/bin/X</b>. What we want to be
able to do is select the host that we will connect to. We
accomplish this using the Xaccess file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#any indirect host can get a chooser
*  CHOOSER BROADCAST
#
# If you'd prefer to configure the set of
# hosts each terminal sees,
# then just uncomment these lines
# (and comment out the CHOOSER line above)
# and edit the %hostlist line as appropriate
#
#%hostlist      host-a host-b
#*              CHOOSER %hostlist       #
</pre>


Although the Xaccess file is a very flexible tool, we will only be
using it to launch the chooser (indirect mode). The chooser is a
little X application that displays a list of available hosts on the
network, allowing us to select the one to which we would like to
connect. I like to use the BROADCAST option because new hosts show
up in the list automatically. Some may prefer to name the hosts
specifically, as shown using the %hostlist macro. This method is
sometimes required, especially in larger networks where the
broadcast doesn't reach all desired hosts.
</p><p>If you are interested in a finer level of control, you can
use a list of servers instead of BROADCAST. This will allow you to
specify the list of available hosts directly.</p><p>If you want to configure xdm to handle requests from
different X servers in different ways, you can specify a hostname
or host list instead of *. Examples of this follow.</p><p>The following lines tell xdm to handle all queries from
either host-a, host-b or host-c itself (Direct mode):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
host-a
host-b
host-c
</pre><p>To tell xdm to send indirect queries from host-a to server-a
or server-b, type
<pre     class="programlisting">
host-a    server-a server-b
</pre>


It could also be written
<pre     class="programlisting">
%hostlist         server-a server-b
host-a              %hostlist
</pre>


You can set up xdm to handle indirect queries using the chooser
(our preferred method). In our next example, host-a gets a chooser
window containing a list of all hosts that answer the BROADCAST,
while everyone else gets only the list specified by %hostlist:
<pre     class="programlisting">
%hostlist         server-a server-b
host-a              CHOOSER BROADCAST
*                      CHOOSER %hostlist.
</pre>


Finally, to finish up the basic functionality, we can look at the
Xresources file. I left mine with the defaults, but some might want
to customize the look and feel a bit. In this file you can change
colors, fonts and other style options. I've found the
Chooser*geometry resource to be the most useful because it allows
you to set the size of the chooser application window.
</p><p>You can configure some administrative functions in xdm-config
as well. Things like DisplayManager.errorLogFilelogfile will set
the location of the log file. This log file contains the stderr
output of xdm, Xsetup, Xstartup, Xsession and Xreset
scripts.</p><p>Upon successful logon-process completion, xdm launches the
script file specified in the session resource. This allows users to
customize the behavior of the X sessions. Administrators will most
likely want to check out the Xsession script. Users will want to
create a $HOME/.xsession or $HOME/.Xclients file to customize the
behavior of the session manager (i.e., start a window manager, a
clock, etc.).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x272f7e8"></a>Testing Our Configuration</h2></div></div><p>In order to test our configuration, we need to find X
(<b  >which X</b>). On my system, it's in
/usr/X11R6/bin/X. In any case, you should end up seeing a logon
screen. To test direct mode you would type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/X -query remotexdmhost
</pre><p>For indirect broadcast mode type
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/X -broadcast
</pre>


And for indirect mode using the chooser, type
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/X -indirect remotexdmhost
</pre>


Once these were working, I created the /etc/rc.d/init.d script to
auto-start and auto-stop the xdm service. See the article on using
the chkconfig utility in the April 2001 <i  >Linux Journal</i> for more information.
</p><p>Then, I created the following scripts to make life simple for
my users. On their workstations, I create a file named
/usr/bin/X11/startx.xdmcp. If the host is called &ldquo;wkstn1&rdquo;, then
the file contains</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/usr/X11R6/bin/X -indirect wkstn1
</pre><p>where hostname is the name of the xdm server (in my case the
workstations are both an xdm server and an X server).
</p><p>Next, I entered</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv /usr/bin/X11/startx /usr/bin/X11/startx.original
chmod 755 /usr/bin/X11/startx.xdmcp
ln -s /usr/bin/X11/startx.xdmcp /usr/bin/X11/startx
</pre><p>This allows any user who may be used to logging in to their
workstation and typing <b  >startx</b> to get a console,
to instead receive a list of available hosts to log in to
(including their own workstation).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2636580.0x2b27fb8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>To recap, we configured the workstations and servers in the
network to use xdm, XDMCP in indirect mode and the chooser in order
to allow users to select the server they wish to use to manage
their X session. This is an administrable solution allowing fine
control over X sessions. It is also easy to use, in that it
provides users a menu of hosts willing to manage their X
session.</p><p>If this type of access is required from platforms such as
Windows, and you don't want to buy or install an X server on your
workstation, then vnc may be an alternative for you.</p><p><a href="4720s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
