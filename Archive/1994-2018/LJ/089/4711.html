    Authenticate users on your Linux system by the numbers with the
    versatile LDAP.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>On the Internet, one can find a mass of
information that is often organized into very different kinds of
directories. The first attempt to establish a standard for
directories was made by X.500, an address book designed to provide
mail addresses for the X.400 mail application. To retrieve data
from this directory, the directory access protocol (DAP) was used,
but it was something of a heavyweight.
</p><p>Other directories were later developed, and although often
quite different, most had in common a base in the X.500 standard.
There also came a new protocol to retrieve data, the lightweight
directory access protocol (LDAP), which nowadays can be used on
almost any computer platform to get data out of almost every
X.500-compatible directory.</p><p>The use of this lightweight directory access protocol will be
examined in this article. First we'll take a look at the
composition of the directory from which one can access data using
LDAP, then we will take a look at how this protocol can be used for
Linux. Finally, I will explain how you can even use an LDAP
directory to authenticate users on your system, which can be an
interesting alternative to network information service
(NIS).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100b6b8"></a>Terminology</h2></div></div><p>LDAP can be used to get information from an X.500-compatible
directory. This directory is a hierarchically organized database in
which different kinds of data are made accessible. Often it is used
to store names and mail addresses, but you can also keep
information about resources on the network or everything needed to
authenticate users on your Linux computers. The hierarchy of the
directory is created by the use of container objects, which are
also referred to as directory components (DCs). These DCs can be
compared to the domains used in the DNS hierarchy. The LDAP
containers even can be linked to DNS domains; so if your company
has a registered DNS domain name, like azlan.com, you can make LDAP
organizational units to obtain names, such as ou=training,
dc=azlan, dc=com.</p><p>In the container objects are the leaf objects, also referred
to as entries because they are actually nothing more than entries
in the LDAP database. An example of such a leaf object is a user
with his or her associated mail address and, if you like, all the
other information needed to authenticate this user on your system.
Each of these entries has a unique name, called the distinguished
name (DN). For example, the user Paul in the training department at
Azlan, which has a registered .com domain, gets the distinguished
name of cn=Paul, ou=training, dc=azlan, dc=com. Besides that, the
entry has a common name (CN), a unique identifier of the object in
its container; you can compare that to a person's surname.</p><p>All these objects have attributes that define the information
associated with the object; a user object, for example, can have
such attributes as an e-mail address and a password. If you want to
use LDAP to authenticate Linux users, it is important that these
attributes have the proper values. That is, you need an attribute
that represents the UID field from /etc/passwd if you want to be
able to use your Linux resources. The exact definition of the
entries, the place where they can occur in the directory and the
attributes associated with them, is done in the schema. In Linux,
the entries are defined in the file slapd.oc.conf and the
attributes in slapd.at.conf.</p><p>The common data format used to get information into the LDAP
database is the LDAP data interchange format (LDIF). If you want to
use it, it is very important that mandatory attributes for each of
the entries are specified; if not, you get some nasty error codes
when you try to define the objects. Mandatory attributes are
defined in spad.oc.conf.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100b8c8"></a>OpenLDAP</h2></div></div><p>In Linux, probably the most used LDAP implementation is
OpenLDAP
(<a href="http://www.openldap.org" target="_self">www.openldap.org</a>).
Proprietary directories are available that are LDAP-compatible,
such as Novell's eDirectory or Netscape's directory. After
installation of OpenLDAP on Linux, (often part of a default server
installation) some files are copied to your system. Before we take
a look at the actual configuration, let's get an overview of the
different files copied.</p><p>The most important program file that is part of your LDAP
installation is the d&aelig;mon slapd, the standalone LDAP
d&aelig;mon. This is the process you need to activate if you want
all the goods of LDAP on your system. If you use more than one LDAP
server on your network, and you want to replicate data between
these servers, you also need slurpd.
<span   class="bold"><b>slurpd</b></span> is the process that
replicates data from an LDAP master server to one or more LDAP
slave servers.</p><p>To configure your LDAP server, of course, you need to edit
some configuration files. Most of them are in /etc/openldap, but
pay attention. Sometimes the same files are also in other
directories, such as /etc, which can make it hard to get a good
configuration. If the files in /etc/openldap exist in more than one
location, I personally prefer to keep only the files in
/etc/openldap and make links to them at all other locations.</p><p>The most important configuration file is slapd.conf; you can
specify almost all the behavior of slapd in it, and it is the file
you want to edit before you run slapd. Besides slapd.conf, there
are two files in which the schema is kept: slapd.oc.conf and
slapd.at.conf. In most cases you don't need to do anything with
these; they are good as they are. In some cases, however, you do
need to edit them in order for an application to work. The last
configuration file is ldap.conf; it is a small but important file
used on an LDAP client to identify the server from which the client
needs to get its data.</p><p>Besides these configuration files, there are some commands
you can use to get data in your directory and to test if there's
actually anything in it. <span   class="bold"><b>ldapadd</b></span>
is used to add data to the directory, ldapmodify to modify
attributes of existing entries and ldapsearch to find some specific
entries. With these and a few other commands, you can manipulate
data in your directory by means of LDIF files.</p><p>The last files we'll talk about are the modules that are used
if you want to get your system to authenticate on an LDAP server.
They are part of other software packages, so they are not always
installed on your system. The module that's used by the nameservice
switch is called nss_ldap. You need to specify in
/etc/nsswitch.conf that you want to retrieve information from an
LDAP directory instead of, for example, /etc/passwd. Another
important module is pam_ldap. This is the module you need in Linux
to let your users authenticate on an LDAP database, by means of the
pluggable authentication modules (PAM). In fact, it's not difficult
to configure an LDAP directory on your system. Only four steps are
needed to complete setup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100bc90"></a>1. Install the Software</h2></div></div><p>If LDAP isn't installed as part of the default server
installation on your system, you can download and install it from
<a href="http://www.openldap.org" target="_self">http://www.openldap.org/</a>
or one of its mirror sites. To accomplish the installation, first
untar the tarball with something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf openldap-stable-<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxxxx</em></span>.tgz
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>xxxxx</em></span> is the version number of the
file you downloaded. Then activate the directory created in the
preceding step, and run the configure script in this directory.
This script verifies that all conditions to install LDAP on your
system have been met. Run <b  >make</b>; first you make
the dependencies with <b  >make depend</b>, then you
compile the program with just <b  >make</b>. Now you can
see if everything compiled correctly by running make in the
directory /test. Finally, you can actually install the software on
your system; type <b  >make install</b> in the directory
created when you expanded the tarball.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100c0b0"></a>2. Edit the Configuration File
slapd.conf</h2></div></div><p>After the installation, you'll find an example of the
configuration file slapd.conf in the directory /etc/openldap. You
will need to edit it to meet the requirements of your organization.
For starters, you don't need to make it too complicated; edit the
example file to look something like Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4711l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Example of
slapd.conf</a></p><p>Let's take a look at the most important lines in this file.
The first two lines are used to include two extra configuration
files. In this case, they are the schema files, which are not
modified at all, but you do need to instruct slapd as to where it
can find them. The line &ldquo;schemacheck = off&rdquo; is also not too
exciting; it tells slapd that it doesn't have to check the schema.
After that there are another two lines that point to some extra
files: slapd.pid, which keeps the PID slapd is using, and
slapd.args, which keeps the arguments that were used when slapd was
started. Then there's the line that defines the kind of database
you are using. You can specify ldbm, shell and passwd, but ldbm is
the most common.</p><p>Then there are three important lines. The first begins
&ldquo;suffix dc=azlan, dc=com&rdquo;; this line defines the standard
container in which slapd should work. In my case, it is equal to
the DNS name of the company I work for. Then the name of the
account allowed to manage or make modifications to the database is
mentioned by its full distinguished name. The third line defines
the password used by this manager; as you see, it is written as a
plain text password, which isn't very secure, but we'll talk about
that later.</p><p>The line &ldquo;directory /usr/local/var/openldap-ldbm&rdquo; defines
the location of the directory where the LDAP database will be
installed. Make sure that its mode is 700 and that the owner of the
slapd process can read and write to it.</p><p>After these lines there are some options that aren't strictly
necessary but can be very handy. First is &ldquo;lastmod on&rdquo;, an option
that keeps track of the users that make modification to objects.
For that, the attributes modifiersName, modifyTimestamp,
creatorsName and createTimestamp are used. Then we have options
that do some indexing. Unfortunately, OpenLDAP isn't the fastest
LDAP directory around, so it could be worthwhile to speed things up
with some indexfiles. loglevel 64, which accomplishes extensive
logging, is good if you want to make things work more quickly. The
minimal value for this parameter is 1, the maximum is 256 and
between that you can use 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128.</p><p>Lastly, there is the specification of some access rights to
the directory. The default is &ldquo;read&rdquo;, meaning anyone can read
anything, including the passwords. The four lines starting with
&ldquo;access to attr=userpassword&rdquo; contain the specifications for who
can do what with the passwords in the directory. The first line
specifies that everyone is allowed to modify his or her own
password. Root is allowed to write to any password, while normal
users can read but not write to passwords (necessary, of course, to
be able to log in to the system).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100c420"></a>3. Start slapd</h2></div></div><p>Once you've edited slapd.conf to your satisfaction, the next
step is to start the LDAP d&aelig;mon slapd. Of course, you could
type <b  >slapd</b> to do that, but you can also tell it
to show you all debug messages by adding the option dn, in which n
represents the number of the debug level you'd like to see.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100c580"></a>4. Add Data to the Directory</h2></div></div><p>Now you can go on to the next step, which is to add data to
the directory. In this example, we'll add some simple data. To do
this, you have to compose an LDIF file that could have the contents
shown in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="4711l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Sample LDIF
File</a></p><p>If you've made a file like Listing 2, which could be called
~/users.ldif, you can add it to the directory with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ldapadd -D "cn=manager, dc=azlan, dc=com" -W &lt; ~/users.ldif
</pre><p>You will be prompted for your password, which is, of course,
the password of the root account as specified in slapd.conf. If
everything goes well, the data should now be added to the
directory.
</p><p>Many errors can be solved by verifying whether slapd is
really running (oh yeah, it happens) and whether you have any extra
spaces in your configuration or LDIF files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100c898"></a>5. See If It Works</h2></div></div><p>Now that you've added the data to the directory, you can
actually determine whether it works with the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ldapsearch -L -b "dc=azlan, dc=com" -W "(objectclass=*)"
</pre><p>You should get all data in the directory returned as a result
(see Figure 1).
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4711f1.large.jpg"><img src="4711f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. ldapsearch</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now that you've come this far, you can do a lot of things
with your directory. You could, for example, simply take your
browser and look for data in your LDAP directory. That isn't the
most interesting part though. As an alternative, you can configure
your Linux client so that authentication is no longer done on your
local password and shadow files, but on the LDAP server, giving you
one central point from which to administer all user data instead of
hundreds of computers with all their individual password files. To
make it all happen, do the following.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x100ccb8"></a>1. Install the Software</h2></div></div><p>Before you can configure your client to authenticate on an
LDAP server, you should make sure all necessary software is
installed. If you are using RPMs, the packages openldap, auth_ldap
and nss_ldap should be present. You can verify that with
<b  >rpm -q <i><tt>packagename</tt></i></b>.
If they are not present, you can find them at
<a href="http://rpmfind.com" target="_self">rpmfind.com</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x1405118"></a>2. Edit ldap.conf</h2></div></div><p>Often, two files are named ldif.conf on systems. One is in
/etc and is used by nss_ldap and pam_ldap to determine where they
can find required information. The other is in /etc/openldap and is
used by utilities such as ldapadd and ldapsearch to determine in
which container they should work. As stated before, delete one of
them and make a link to the other to make things easy. Once that's
done, you can put the necessary data in it. For a simple
configuration you only need two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BASE    dc=azlan, dc=com
HOST    laetitia.azlan.com
</pre><p>The first line specifies the default container where the
client should look for data, and the second line gives the name of
your LDAP server. Of course, your system must be able to resolve
this name by means of DNS or something similar, otherwise you could
use an IP address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x14052d0"></a>3. Edit nsswitch.conf</h2></div></div><p>Next, you have to tell the nameservice switch where it should
look for data. Do this by editing the file /etc/nsswitch.conf; it
should contain the following lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
passwd: files ldap
shadow: files ldap
group: files ldap
</pre><p>With these lines, your system first tries to authenticate
users on your local password files, and if that doesn't work, it
tries to authenticate on the LDAP database. So if a user exists in
/etc/passwd, and he or she gives the password that is in
/etc/shadow, LDAP will not be used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x1405488"></a>4. Edit Your PAM Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Next, you should take a look at PAM. This is the mechanism
used on most modern Linux distributions by the different programs
that have anything to do with user authentication. It can, for
example, be used by login, but also by FTP, su, ssh, passwd, etc.
In recent versions of PAM, each of these programs has a
configuration file, normally in /etc/pam.d. In this configuration
file you can specify the PAM modules that should be used by the
module.</p><p>If you want the login process to do authentication on LDAP,
the corresponding configuration file could look like Listing
3.</p><p><a href="4711l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Login Doing
Authentication</a></p><p>Let's give a brief explanation. There are four processes in
which user and password information is used. First there is
authentication, represented in the PAM file by &ldquo;auth&rdquo;. This
process lets you into the system, and one of its responsibilities
is to check your password. Then there is &ldquo;account&rdquo;, which
verifies whether the user has any account restrictions that could
prevent him or her from logging in to the system. After that there
is &ldquo;password&rdquo;, which is used if you want to change your password.
Lastly, &ldquo;session&rdquo; specifies the tasks to be done if you want to
use other resources on the system on which you are already
authenticated.</p><p>Each of these modules has specific tasks. These tasks are
specified in the PAM modules, and one of the most important is
pam_unix.so. This module takes care of the normal passwd/shadow
authentication and is normally required if you want access to the
system. But if you are using LDAP, it is also good if LDAP is able
to let you in. So before the line where pam_unix is called, there
is a line where pam_ldap is called. It is not required (you still
want to be able to use your system if the LDAP server is down) but
it is sufficient. That is, if you can be authenticated by pam_ldap,
you don't have to go to pam_unix afterward. Besides these two major
modules, there are some minor modules that are not discussed
here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf13580.0x1405748"></a>5. Create the Users with All the Needed
Attributes</h2></div></div><p>After you have done the four preceding steps, your computer
is ready to authenticate on the LDAP directory. But is your
directory also ready? To prepare your directory for authentication,
you need to put all relevant user attributes in it, all the
information normally in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. Otherwise, how
could you use your precious resources without a proper user ID and
all the other nice things from these files? To get the information,
you can use some Perl scripts specially created to get information
out of the files on your computer and into the LDAP database, or
you can make your own LDIF file to import the users you
want.</p><p>If you want to do it all automatically, many Perl scripts are
available at
<a href="http://www.padl.org" target="_self">http://www.padl.org/</a>.
There are scripts to import almost all settings that can also be in
an NIS database&mdash;your password files, your host file, your network
file, etc. Before you can use them, however, you have to edit the
general configuration file, migrate_common.ph. In this file you
have to change some parameters that specify the location where the
data has to be created. Especially important are
DEFAULT_MAIL_DOMAIN and DEFAULT_BASE; they specify the DNS domain
in which users have their e-mail accounts and the LDAP container in
which users must be created, respectively. Once that's done, you
can start the import. For each different kind of information,
there's a separate script; probably the most interesting of them
are migrate_all_online.sh, which imports all network information,
and migrate_passwd.pl, which imports the users on your
system.</p><p>The other way to get things done is by means of an LDIF file,
the contents of which must be added to the database using ldapadd.
The most important thing for this file is that all the right
properties are specified. Listing 4 shows an example of how to
ensure this.</p><p><a href="4711l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Sample Property
Specification for an LDIF File</a></p><p>There are only two disadvantages to this method. First, the
home directory isn't automatically created when you create the user
in the LDIF database, but there's a PAM module named
pam_mkhomedir.so that can take care of it for you. The other
problem is user passwords; there's no nice method to get them in
encrypted form in the database. A less elegant way to accomplish
this is to create the user once in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,
give him or her a password and copy the encrypted string out of
/etc/shadow and into your LDIF file.</p><p>Once this is done, you can try the whole thing out. Delete
the user from your local files, open a login prompt and try to log
in; it should work just fine.</p></div></div>
