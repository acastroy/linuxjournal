    The answer you don't want to hear.

of the security consulting firm @stake (the current employer of
world-famous Mudge) to have lunch with Frank Heidt, a friend who is
managing security architect. I unexpectedly ended up having to wait
some minutes while Frank attended a conference call. When he came
out, it was to complain about the weekend of work ahead and to tell
me that our lunch would have to be a ten-minute coffee break
instead.
</p><p>The conference call had been from a client company who was
having difficulty in selecting among the short list of unsavory
options presented by @stake. They are the victims of their own
security department gone rogue. At this point, at the mercy of
their own employees, their choices are few and expensive. Frank
tells me that in his experience, a significant majority of security
cracks and threats are internal, which reminded me that a majority
of murders and rapes are also committed by perpetrators known to
the victim. Rather than barred windows, pepper spray and firewalls,
the better investment may be in the time you take to choose whom
you let in the physical door. As Bob Toxen writes in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Real
World Linux Security</em></span>, &ldquo;The presence of a
firewall...should not be an excuse to allow insecure systems behind
it.&rdquo;</p><p>Given that complete security is unachievable and laxity
foolhardy, I asked Frank about his security philosophy. He replied
that he doesn't really have one specifically, but that the client's
requirements should determine the security strategy to be taken. He
views security not as a magic list of firewalls, tools and daily
tasks (though he believes Snort to be about the best IDS out there)
but more of a set of requirements to be met and limitations to be
considered. For those looking for that holy grail of security, this
seems like a nonanswer, but it's really the only one that makes
sense. Apologies for returning to physical-safety metaphors, but
it's just too similar to what a self-defense instructor friend of
mine used to tell me. He couldn't provide specific actions for a
given attack, such as &ldquo;When he grabs your arm kick him in the
groin&rdquo; (a rather ineffectual way of deterring a determined
attacker incidentally), because attacks aren't scripted. Defense
needs to be based on principles, such as &ldquo;against a stronger
attacker, your safest position is in close&rdquo;, rather than given
techniques.</p><p>In both situations the most important work is up to the
company or person seeking security and defense. A secure system is
the result of an intimate knowledge of individual security
requirements and limitations. Consultants are valuable for
providing technical know-how and pointing out possibilities, but
your network security is ultimately work that must be done by
you.</p><p>Rob Beck's (another @staker) article in this month's feature
section is a good example. He provides a great little application
for fingerprint evasion, but the level of anonymity (and even
whether anonymity is high on one's security priority list) is up to
the user, as Rob points out.</p><p>In addition to the usual Paranoid Penguin and security
feature articles, this issue's Kernel Korner, Focus on Software and
Take Command are also secure-centric. In fact, we ended up with so
many HOWTO security articles that a number of them couldn't be
squeezed into the print magazine and were relegated to the infinite
space of our web site&mdash;see the Strictly On-Line section of the
contents page for titles.</p></div></div>
