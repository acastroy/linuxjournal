France. Like most countries outside North America, drivers in
France are relatively aggressive. In American terms, they tend to
tailgate&mdash;as if their cars were sustained by the exhaust fumes of
the cars they follow. Multiple-car crashes are not uncommon.
</p><p>One day my friend Lief, a Swedish dude with a very dry sense
of humor, came into a meeting and said, &ldquo;Did you hear how many
cars were involved in the big accident yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;, we answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess&rdquo;, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Ten?&rdquo; one of us replied.</p><p>Lief shook his head and made a thumbs-up gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty?&rdquo;</p><p>His thumb poked upward.</p><p>&ldquo;Sixty?&rdquo;</p><p>Still upward.</p><p>&ldquo;A hundred?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two hundred?&rdquo;</p><p>The thumb stayed up.</p><p>&ldquo;We give up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two hundred thirty-eight&rdquo;, he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Was anybody killed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>This story comes to mind when I think about the dot-com
crash. I'd guess right now (I'm writing this in late June 2001),
we're about 180 cars into this thing. It's now obvious that the
crashing will continue, right up to the point when every public-
and venture-funded technology company that was never a real
business ceases attempting to become one. In most cases, that will
happen when they finish burning their investors' money&mdash;after
crashing their investors' cars while smoking one anothers'
exhaust.</p><p>When the &ldquo;internet economy&rdquo; was still a high-speed traffic
jam somewhere back in 1999, I was at a party in San Francisco. Most
of the folks there were young, hip &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo;. Lots of
all-black outfits, spiky haircuts, goatees and face jewelry. I fell
into conversation with one of these guys&mdash;a smart, eager young chap
I'd met at other gatherings. He was on his second or third startup
and eagerly evangelizing his new company's &ldquo;mission&rdquo; with a
stream of buzzwords.</p><p>&ldquo;What does your company do, exactly?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We're an arms merchant to the portals industry&rdquo;, he
replied.</p><p>When I pressed him for more details (How are portals an
industry? What kind of arms are you selling?), I got more buzzwords
back. Finally, I asked a rude question. &ldquo;How are sales?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They're great. We just closed our second round of
financing.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus I was delivered an epiphany: every company has two
markets&mdash;one for its goods and services, and one for itself&mdash;and
the latter had overcome the former. We actually thought selling
companies to investors was a real business model. We lost sight of
the plain fact that any company that needs to articulate a business
model doesn't really have one.</p><p>This idea&mdash;making money by selling a potential hit company
concept to investors&mdash;had a familiar sound to it. After all, VCs
seemed to be looking for big IPO scores the way entertainment
companies look for blockbusters. VC-funded companies had more in
common with movies and Broadway plays than with real enterprises
that worked toward profits and persistence from day one. In the
parlance of the entertainment biz, these companies were really just
projects.</p><p>In fact, the dot-com business model was scripted a quarter
century earlier by Mel Brooks as the premise of his first hit
movie, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Producers</em></span>, which is now revived as
a hit Broadway musical. Coincidence? I don't think so. Check out
this dialogue between the two main characters, down-and-out
Broadway producer Max Bialystock and his accountant Neil
Bloom:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;How can a producer make more money with a flop
than he could with a hit?&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;It's simply a matter of creative accounting...you simply
raise more money than you need. If you were really a bald criminal,
you could have raised a million.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the play cost nearly $60,000 to produce. You know how
long it had run? One night!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see? If you...raised a million dollars you could have
put on a $60,000 flop and kept the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if the play was a hit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you'd go to jail. Once the play was a hit you'd have
to pay off all the backers, and with so many backers there would
never be enough profits to go around. Get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So in order for this scheme to work, we have to find a
sure-fire flop!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Of course, nobody goes into business intending to flop. But
plenty of people went into dot-com flops intending both to get rich
quick and live comfortably off the investment proceeds in the
meantime. And those proceeds were enormous. At its peak in early
2000, VCs were spending two dozen billion dollars on a per-annum
basis in Silicon Valley alone. Over half the world's countries have
smaller gross domestic products. Lots of that money went to
providing upper-class lifestyles to hot young e-xecutives. Just ask
the BMW dealers in Silicon Valley.
</p><p>But why was the rush so big? Because dumb investors were
willing to take all the risk. That's what makes the Bialystock
scheme work. In a normal business startup, the risk is shared by
investor and entrepreneur.</p><p>Think about it. If you want to start a restaurant or a small
manufacturing company, you go to the bank and get a loan
collateralized by very real assets belonging to you or somebody
willing to take the risk for you (like, say, your friendly
Godfather). But if you want to start CoApathetic.com, you get your
VCs and other investors to take all the risk. Play it right and all
you expose are your time and reputation. Yes, your holdings in the
company are exposed, too; but the company isn't really a company in
the traditional sense. Again, it's a project: a false-front store
on the main street of a gold-rush town. Your main job is to make
IPO money for your backers. So you attract attention by publicly
burning the millions of dollars your backers put up. You buy other
companies, rent out cool office space in SOMA, hire a chief
marketing officer to put big bucks into &ldquo;branding&rdquo;--or whatever
it takes to tailgate with everybody else in that high-speed,
dot-com traffic jam. (To mix a few metaphors I can't
resist.)</p><p>Last week I met an interesting dude at our own garage sale.
In his own words he had just finished &ldquo;failing&rdquo; his company. The
sad thing, he said, was that his company actually had good
customers&mdash;lots of them, and big ones, too&mdash;and a good idea (he
told me what it was, and I agreed). His problem was that the
software didn't work. And the reason it didn't work was that he
wasn't a programmer. He had jobbed out the labor. &ldquo;I learned you
can't outsource your core competency&rdquo;, he said. In the absence of
that competency, he shouldn't have been in the business. &ldquo;You
can't get somebody else to breathe for you.&rdquo; That was his first
lesson.</p><p>His second was discovering who to blame for the dot-com
crash. &ldquo;I blame marketing&rdquo;, he said. Why? Because it's so
disconnected from reality&mdash;from what customers are actually doing
in the real world. Always has been, always will be. Marketing is so
delusional, and so good at producing delusions, that it tempted
thousands of investors and investees to speed their way into a
high-speed traffic jam of companies rushing to make money by
selling advertising, of all things (like TV! like billboards!) on
the Web&mdash;in spite of the fact that there is negative demand for the
stuff, as demonstrated by the MUTE button on every remote control
sold with every consumer electronic device that carries
advertising. Worse, it fooled lots of people into thinking they
could sell what the Net made free&mdash;especially the efficiencies that
the Net itself began to produce before eager investors projected
fantasies all over it.</p><p>But his third lesson was the one that really mattered. &ldquo;The
Net still changed everything&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;In spite of all these
failures and all this insanity, it's just fine.&rdquo; Why? Because it's
real, and its benefits are real. &ldquo;The Net is the biggest and best
thing that ever happened to business&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Even though you
can't really sell it.&rdquo;</p><p>Likewise, I submit that Linux is the biggest and best thing
that ever happened to software, even though you can't really sell
it. Like the Net (which is thick with Linux and other free and open
forms of UNIX), it changes everything by giving us something with
vast and far-reaching practical benefits. If your company does
anything with software, there's a good chance you can put Linux to
good work.</p><p>Maybe that's why the big companies that have fallen in love
with Linux all went through their IPOs a long time ago.</p></div></div>
