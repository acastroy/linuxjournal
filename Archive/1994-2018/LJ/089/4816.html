Yah, I believe that. ;)
&gt; But I want them back.  They're practically
&gt; collectors items&mdash;like the Spruce Goose or
&gt; something like that.  So whoever took them, please
Only penguins, and smaller, and not as sprucey.
&gt; return them.  I've arranged with the staff at
&gt; Brandt College for the reception people to accept a
&gt; package an hour before the July meeting, no
&gt; questions asked.  That's fair, isn't it?
&gt; Give someone else a chance at them.  Not

Hmmm.  That rings a bell.  Anyway, do like the lady

discover which operating systems electrical distributors in the
southeastern United States used. This study examined the types of
operating systems in use, how they were used, the perceived
reliability of each operating system and future plans for
implementing other operating systems. After developing a survey
instrument, 159 surveys were sent and 92 were completed and
returned. Responses from the 92 respondents were used for data
analysis.</p><p>The research revealed that distributors were using 15
different operating systems. The operating systems used were
Windows NT, Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, Windows Millennium
Edition, UNIX, Linux, OS/400, OS/2, Open VMS, Novell, VSE/ESA, MPE,
Solaris, DOS and Advanced 36. Of all 92 respondents, 78 used
Windows NT, making it the most widely used operating system.
Windows 95/98 followed close with 77 respondents. Only 17 used UNIX
and 6 used Linux.</p><p>With all operating systems included, the most common use for
the operating system was as an application server. Windows NT
accounted for 46% of the application servers. The second most
common use was a fileserver, with Windows NT accounting for 64% of
those. Print servers, e-mail servers and web servers, respectively,
were the next most common uses for the operating systems. Windows
NT was the most common operating system used for each of these
purposes.</p><p>Overall, although not as popular, non-Microsoft operating
systems were rated significantly more reliable than Microsoft
operating systems. The mean reliability score of Microsoft
operating systems was 7.62, while the mean reliability score for
non-Microsoft operating systems was 9.66. Windows NT was the most
reliable of the Microsoft operating systems. Of the non-Microsoft
operating systems, OS/400 had a mean reliability score of 10 (n =
6), followed closely by Linux with a mean score of 9.4 (n = 6) and
UNIX with a mean of 9.36 (n = 14). For a PDF version of the full

and extended the Microsoft &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; called .NET. Titled the
Mono Project, they called it &ldquo;a community initiative to develop an
open source, Linux-based version of the Microsoft .NET development
platform&rdquo;. In a number of interviews, Ximian CTO Miguel de Icaza
was remarkably flattering to .NET. To <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Register</em></span> he said, &ldquo;.NET solves a number of problems
we've been trying to solve in GNOME. Instead of wasting our time
trying to create a new standard, we're embracing .NET and extending
it for our own purposes.&rdquo; To <i  >Linux Journal</i> he
said, &ldquo;We saw in .NET a mechanism that would allow programmers to
become more efficient. You have garbage collection. You have
thread-based libraries. You can use any programming language&mdash;and
none of the class libraries have dependencies on Windows. There is
a lot of device and platform independence.&rdquo;</p><p>On Slashdot and Linux Today the responses ranged from &ldquo;Way
to go&rdquo; to &ldquo;Dare we ask it? Has de Icaza been seduced by the dark
side?&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, the effort has a lot more scope in ambition than in
actual size. While .NET is a vast development framework, de Icaza
tells us:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We're mostly looking at just what Microsoft calls
the Framework SDK. This basically consists of three pieces. The
first is a virtual machine&mdash;they call it a virtual execution
system&mdash;which is basically a runtime. So far we have implemented
one-third of our C# compiler; we've started work on a runtime
engine, a just-in-time compiler for Linux; and we've also started
work on class libraries to run our compiler inside of Linux. It's
not a complete project yet and won't be for another six months.
Then we hope to have by the end of the year something that can run
the compiler&mdash;a system which is self-hosting, so we can compile the
compiler itself on Linux. It's a huge project. That's why it has to
be an open-source project. We can't do all the work alone.</p></blockquote></div><p>Craig Burton, an analyst with Burtonian.com (who joined in
during the same <i  >Linux Journal</i> interview) says,
&ldquo;It won't be easy, especially since Microsoft won't even be done
with the .NET framework before the end of the year. Microsoft
hasn't even explained .NET to itself. A lot could change before the
end of the year.&rdquo;
</p><p>De Icaza responds, &ldquo;Microsoft right now has .NET at a point
it calls 'API stable'. We're working from (what they) submitted to
the European Commission.&rdquo; Instead his main concern, shared with
many who remarked on the announcement in public forums, is with
licensing. De Icaza thinks Microsoft's public concerns about the
GPL are a smokescreen for its perception of Linux as a direct
competitor for its service business. Regardless of Microsoft's
motives, any attempts to embrace and extend .NET are likely to be a
source of legal concern to the company.</p><p>Meanwhile the idea in the medium-long run, de Icaza said, is
to let developers create .NET applications and run them on any
Mono-supported platform, including Linux, UNIX, and of course,
Windows. That's the goal he and Ximian will be working toward with
the Mono Project.</p><p>On Slashdot &ldquo;polar bear&rdquo; writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's a long shot. But if IBM, Sun, HP and the
rest got behind a true open standard Web services framework,
Microsoft wouldn't be able to deny its competitors an equal playing
field&mdash;which is exactly what it wants to do with .NET&mdash;they want to
deploy pieces of .NET to other OSes to lure people in to using it,
but the choice bits will only work with Windows. An open .NET would
allow everyone to have an equal footing. Sure, Microsoft could
still play ball, but they'd lose some of their bully power.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the days that followed the announcement, however, another
potential strategy emerged, suggested first by Burton&mdash;who employed
exactly the same strategy when he was fighting Microsoft,
successfully, at Novell in the 1980s&mdash;then picked up by others.
That strategy is &ldquo;redirection&rdquo;. By contrast, Burton calls
Ximian's strategy &ldquo;cloning&rdquo;. He writes, &ldquo;The cloning method
simply means that you rewrite all of the code that Microsoft has
developed and run it on a different platform.&rdquo; Redirection, he
continues, is a way to &ldquo;redirect&rdquo; or &ldquo;hijack&rdquo; the
Microsoft-generated object data flow to servers that are not
controlled by Microsoft. The same strategy could apply to data
streams of all kinds, including instant messaging (IM). XML streams
of AOL and Microsoft Messenger client code could be redirected into
Jabber's IM server, for example.
</p><p>In the long run, Burton believes, &ldquo;.NET (all of it) and
HailStorm are going to be redirected technologies. If I were
Ximian&mdash;or any other open-source vendor for that matter&mdash;I would be
busy building redirection-based code, not clone-based
code.&rdquo;</p><p>And thanks to the nature of open source, the bazaar will
decide.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div></div>
