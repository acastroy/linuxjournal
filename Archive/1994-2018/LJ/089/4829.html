    Beat potential invaders at their own game by learning how to use

have a common genesis: the cracker world. Tools, like port scanners
and password crackers, originally designed to aid black-hats in
their attempts to compromise systems, have been profitably applied
by systems administrators to audit the security of their own
servers and user accounts. This article presents a cracker
idea&mdash;the kernel module exploit&mdash;and shows how you can improve your
system's security by using some of the same ideas and techniques.
First, I will discuss the origin of my idea and how it works, then
I will attempt to demystify the art of kernel module programming
with a few short examples. Finally, we will walk through a
substantial, useful example that will help prevent a class of
attacks from compromising your system.
</p><p>Before we get started, I need to mention the standard
disclaimer. Be aware that a bug in kernel space is liable to crash
your machine, and an endless loop in kernel space will hang your
machine. Do not develop and test new modules on a production
machine, and test modules thoroughly to ensure they do not
destabilize your system or corrupt your data. To minimize data loss
due to system crashes in the debugging cycle, I recommend that you
either use a virtual machine or emulator (like bochs, plex86, the
User-Mode Linux port or VMware) for testing, or install a
journaling filesystem (like SGI's xfs) on your development
workstation. Furthermore, none of the code examples in this article
have been tested on an SMP machine, and most of it is likely not
multiprocessor safe. Now that we have that out of the way, let's
talk about modules.</p><p>A few months ago, I was developing a system called audit
trail generator for Linux. For every process on a system, I wanted
to keep track of all system calls and their arguments. To this end,
I experimented with several approaches, but none was as successful
as I would have liked. Wrapping the libc function for write(), for
example, only enabled me to log write() invocations that originated
from C programs, and dynamic binary instrumentation was limited by
the sorts of executables the instrumentation library could parse
(C, C++ and Fortran). Being limited to auditing executables
produced by one of a few languages was only a small practical
limitation, since virtually every program on a GNU/Linux system is
written in C, C++ or some language that has a C- or C++-based
runtime library, like Perl or Python. However, the incompleteness
of these solutions really bothered me on a theoretical level. I
knew how straightforward it would be to bypass this system by
invoking a system call from a little-known language that didn't
rely on C or C++, or even by handcrafting a system call in assembly
language. It was clear that it would be impossible to write an
insubversible user-space auditing tool, and it would be tough to
write a really useful tool without hacking into the kernel. Since I
didn't want to maintain a patch or deal with a lengthy
recompile-reboot-debug cycle, I didn't think doing this in kernel
space was feasible.</p><p>No sooner had I put these concerns on the back burner and
started work on this project than I saw a message to my local LUG's
mailing list that gave me an idea. This message was a forwarded
advisory about a kernel module exploit. This particular module was
a nasty one: it modified the behavior of certain system calls to
hide itself from the lsmod command and to hide the presence of
scanners, crackers, sniffer logs and other such files. I almost
screamed &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; in my office. I didn't have to deal with
maintaining a kernel patch, recompiling or rebooting; I could
develop my tool as a loadable module. I recognized that the general
technique behind module exploits could be adapted to add many types
of useful behavior to system calls, including a different security
policy, finer-grained security than the UNIX model allows and, of
course, my audit trail generator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a86b8"></a>Hello, Kernel!</h2></div></div><p>I will discuss some of the fun things you can do by altering
and wrapping system calls a little later, but let us first get our
hands dirty with an example kernel module. This is a simple
example, akin to everyone's favorite first program, but it
demonstrates the most basic parts of a loadable kernel module, the
init_module and cleanup_module functions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
int init_module() {
   printk("&lt;1&gt; Hello, kernel!\n");
   return 0;
}
void cleanup_module() {
   printk("&lt;1&gt;I'm not offended that you"
          "unloaded me.  Have a pleasant day!\n");
}
</pre><p>You may have to use #define for the symbol MODVERSIONS and
#include for the file linux/modversions.h from the Linux source
tree, depending on how your system is set up. Call this short
module hello.c and compile it with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -c -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ hello.c
</pre>


You should now have a file called hello.o in your current
directory. If you're currently in X, switch over to a virtual
console and (as root) type <b  >insmod hello.o</b>. You
should see &ldquo;Hello, kernel!&rdquo; on your screen. If you would like to
check that your module is loaded, use the lsmod command; it should
show that your hello module is loaded and taking up memory. You can
now <b  >rmmod</b> this module; it will politely inform
you that you have unloaded it.
</p><p>The linux/kernel.h and linux/module.h header files are the
two most basic for any module development, and you are likely to
need them for any module you write. It is best if these headers
(unlike modversions.h) come from /usr/include/linux rather than a
Linux source tree. (If your distribution vendor has made
/usr/include/linux a link to the Linux source tree, complain&mdash;that
practice is liable to cause major breakage and headaches for you.)
You will use quite a few more of the kernel headers for any
substantial module, and you will find that</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep -l /usr/include/linux
</pre><p>is a good friend while developing modules.
</p><p>Think of init_module as an &ldquo;object constructor&rdquo; for your
module. <span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span> should
allocate storage, initialize data and alter the kernel state so
that your module can do its work. In this case, init_module is
merely announcing its presence and returning 0 to signify success,
as in many C functions. Therefore, our initialization for the hello
module consists solely of calling the printk function, a
particularly handy function to have at your disposal. Essentially,
it functions like the standard C printf function, but for two
differences. First, and most obviously, printk allows you to
specify a priority for a given message (the &ldquo;1&rdquo; in angle
brackets). Second, printk sends its output to a circular buffer
that is consumed by the kernel logger and (possibly) sent to
syslogd. Since the output of syslog is flushed frequently, calling
printk with judiciously placed, high-priority messages can greatly
aid debugging&mdash;especially since any bug in kernel-space code is
liable to crash your machine or at least cause a &ldquo;kernel
oops&rdquo;.</p><p>Why not just use printf, you ask? Simple: to do so would be
impossible. The Linux kernel is not linked to the C library, so old
friends like printf are unavailable in kernel-space code. However,
there are many useful routines in the kernel that give you
functionality similar to library routines, including workalikes for
most of the str family of functions from the C library. To use
these in your modules, merely include linux/string.h (be careful
not to include the C library version).</p><p>If init_module is a constructor, remove_module is the
destructor. Be sure to tidy up after your module as carefully as
possible; if you don't free some memory or restore a data
structure, you'll have to reboot to return your system to
normal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a8be0"></a>A More Interesting Module</h2></div></div><p>Now we graduate to a more advanced example. Listing 1
presents a module that logs a message every time someone other than
uid 0 (root) or uid 500 (me on my workstation) invokes the write
system call with the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; somewhere in the buffer. You
may have to stretch a little to find a use for this module by
itself, but I assure you it demonstrates several useful concepts.
We are able to do this all by replacing the write system call with
our own function that performs the checking and logging, and then
calls write. Let's go through this example step by step.</p><p><a href="4829l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Checking and Logging
Function</a></p><p>Notice all of the include files. There sure are a lot of
them, but don't despair, the ones we are going to worry about are
linux/sched.h and asm/uaccess.h. The sched.h include allows you to
access the current task_struct structure via the current macro,
providing a great deal of useful information about the current
process (see Table 1 for a list of some useful fields in
task_struct), while uaccess.h provides useful macros for accessing
user-space memory (more on this later).</p><p><a href="4829t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Useful task_struct
Fields</a></p><p>Even these few fields in task_struct are enough to enable
some really interesting modules. Should arbitrary users be allowed
to su to root? You can prevent them from doing so by wrapping
setuid and checking for one of several prespecified UIDs before
allowing the &ldquo;real&rdquo; setuid. This will allow you to develop, at
the kernel level, an equivalent to the wheel group, or group of
users that are allowed to su root. As an aside, the FSF has long
held that the wheel group is a tool of fascist administrators (see
the documentation for GNU su for more information).</p><p>Being able to audit or alter the behavior of system calls,
simply on the basis of which uid invokes them, is obviously a
powerful ability. It can make for good security policy to control
and audit the actions of the &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; user and its friends, the
uucp, mail and postgres users carefully. However, an even more
powerful technique is to alter behavior based on an argument. We
will ignore sys_call_table and origwrite for now and proceed
directly to wrapped_write, which examines both the uid of the
invoking process and its buffer argument.</p><p>The first thing you should notice is that wrapped_write
begins with a call to kmalloc. Why not malloc, you may ask?
Remember, we're still in kernel space, and we don't have access to
malloc and other standard library functions. Even if we did,
calling malloc, which returns a pointer to user-space memory, would
be worthless. We need to allocate some memory in kernel space to
copy data into from the buf argument. This is an important point:
the same memory visibility barrier between kernel and user space
that keeps your programs from crashing the kernel also adds a
little bit of complexity to your kernel programming. When you call
write from a C program, you pass a pointer to a user-space memory
block that is inaccessible from the kernel. Therefore, if you want
to do any operations on data pointed to by a user-space pointer,
you will have to first copy that memory area into kernel space. The
copy_from_user macro does this for you.
<span   class="bold"><b>copy_from_user</b></span> takes three
arguments, a &ldquo;to&rdquo; pointer, a &ldquo;from&rdquo; pointer and a count.</p><p>The remainder of wrapped_write is fairly straightforward,
given what we know about current and task_struct. Perhaps a more
interesting module would use strstr to check for the string &ldquo;Linux
sucks&rdquo;, and if it existed, alter write_buf at that point to
contain &ldquo;Linux rule&rdquo;, then transfer write_buf back to user space
(with the copy_to_user macro) before calling the original write.
Then, if unsuspecting users wrote &ldquo;Linux sucks&rdquo;, it would be
replaced with &ldquo;Linux rules&rdquo;.
<span   class="bold"><b>kfree</b></span> is important here. Leaking
memory in the kernel is a bad thing, so be sure to
<b  >kfree</b> everything you
<b  >kmalloc</b>.</p><p>It is in init_module that we actually make the switch so that
our function is called instead of the original write. Recall that
syss_call_table is an array of pointers to functions. By altering
the value at index SYS_write (a constant representing the system
call number for write), we are able to cause another function to
replace write. Be sure to save the original function, so you can
replace it when the module is unloaded! You can test this module
out by compiling and installing it with insmod; then
<b  >su</b> to some user other than 0 or 500, and
type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% echo "I like Linux"
</pre><p>on a virtual console. You should get a message from the
kernel that you're talking about Linux again. Congratulations! You
are now ready for a module that does something useful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a92c0"></a>A Final Example</h2></div></div><p>Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/089/4829.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue89/4829.tgz</a>]
demonstrates a useful module that can help prevent your system from
falling victim to stack-smashing attacks. A stack-smashing attack
basically consists of writing past the end of a fixed-size buffer,
so that the return address of the current function is overwritten,
usually with a jump to exec (/bin/sh, ...). Since there really is
no reason for programs like httpd, fingerd or wu-ftpd to
<span   class="bold"><b>exec</b></span> a shell, we shall provide a
mechanism to disallow it. By this point, you already have the
knowledge to understand most of the code, with one small exception:
the strncpy_from_user function. As you might expect, it functions
much like its C-library counterpart, strncpy, and is a handy way to
get a null-terminated string from user space. Since the code is
straightforward, we'll briefly discuss the approach, and then I'll
leave you to come up with great ideas of your own for improving
your system's security.</p><p>The implementation in Listing 2 is straightforward. It is not
as efficient or robust as one might want, but this code was written
in the interest of clarity, and it is easy work to make it better
by changing the linear search in wrapped_execve to something more
efficient. Essentially, what this module does is overload the kill
system call so that if you send signal 42 to a process; it is added
to a list of &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; processes, processes that should not be
allowed to execute any binary with &ldquo;sh&rdquo; in its filename. (42 is
one of the real-time signals; you probably aren't using it. If you
are, feel free to substitute any number between 32 and 64.) The
execve system call then checks to see whether the process is an
unsafe one and, if so, checks to see if it is trying to execute a
shell. If so, it returns success without doing anything. It is easy
to use this module for all of your server processes; simply add
this to your init scripts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -42 ...
</pre><p>Listing 2 represents an evolutionary step from Listing 1, but
it shows that one can modify the behavior of calls, not just add
behavior to the call path. It also does useful work. I hope that
you are as excited as I am about the possibilities of writing
kernel module exploits to improve your security. This article has
given you the basic tools to get started. Fortunately, there is a
wealth of documentation available to Linux programmers that will
help you write more complex and functional modules; see the
