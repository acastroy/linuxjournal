Science-fiction geeks have very specific definitions for their (okay,
&ldquo;our&rdquo;)
jargon. A cyborg is a hybrid mechanical and organic creature. An AI (artificial
intelligence) is a purely electronic device or program capable of thought. And
an android is a purely mechanical and electronic device with a human appearance. In
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> terms, the Borg are cyborgs, and Data is an android. Then Google came
and messed everything up. &ldquo;Android&rdquo; is now synonymous with the operating system
on phones and tablets everywhere. Unless it's an obscure social commentary on
square shapes and human obesity, I think it's safe to assume Google just went
with a cool-sounding, futuristic name. This month, we focus on Google's Android,
the Linux-based operating system that's taking over the planet.

Reuven M. Lerner starts out the issue with the universal translator of the programming
world&mdash;namely, Unicode. Although it makes life easier all across the planet, working
with Unicode can be challenging. Reuven addresses some of those challenges, and
shows how to work through them. Dave Taylor helps us work through some things
too as he continues his series on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> script we've been working on.
Whether you want to learn scripting, or better understand
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span>, it's an
awesome series.

Kyle Rankin brings us another Raspberry Pi article this month, this time doing
fault tolerance with redundant Web servers. Kyle's articles always make me hungry
for knowledge, but the past couple months, his titles have made me hungry in
general&mdash;Raspberry Pi, indeed. I, on the other hand, talk about cryptocurrency
this month. It's been a while since I've mentioned Bitcoins or Litecoins, and
with the recent bubble, perhaps it's time to dust off those miners and start
generating cash. It's not a surefire way to get rich, but you might be able to
earn enough income to buy some Raspberry Pi devices and keep up with Kyle!

Generally, developers develop computer programs on computers. They also develop
mobile applications on computers. Joey Bernard shows us AIDE this month, which is
a nifty way to develop Android apps while using the Android OS! If you've ever
wanted to do some coding while on the road, but you're stuck with only your
tablet, you'll want to check out this article. Nitish Tiwari delves into
development this month as well, but he discusses testing side of things. If you want to port
your application to new hardware, go directly to his article and start reading.

Bill Childers and I are kindred spirits when it comes to mobile technology. I
think his pile of goodies is a little taller than mine, but thankfully, he shares
his experiences with us all. A couple months back, I wrote about my Nexus 7
tablet. Bill goes in a slightly different direction with his Nexus 7, and he
explains
how to boot in to completely different ROMs! Whether you want to try
CyanogenMod or Ubuntu on your tablet, MultiBOOT is your tool, and Bill describes
how to use it.

At times, we can get arrogant about security as Linux users. Himanshu Arora looks
deeper into viruses and worms. Are we safer by design? Are we setting ourselves
up for disaster? Himanshu's article is a must-read for anyone interested in the
debate. And finally, Tracy Ragan's opinion piece on DevOps is one that hits home
to an old-timer like me. The scale of data centers is such that the traditional
static scripts and hacks are being phased out by newer, truly automated systems.

If you think Android is a little green robot that lives in your phone, or
if you think Google has blasphemed all of science fiction, this Android issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> should be enjoyable. 
I can't bring myself to
make a cheesy comment like, &ldquo;set phasers to awesome&rdquo;, so I'll just hope you enjoy
this issue. We think it's awesome, phasers or no.

Journal</em></span>. He's also the
Gadget Guy for LinuxJournal.com, and he has an interesting collection
of vintage Garfield coffee mugs. Don't let his silly hairdo fool you,
he's a pretty ordinary guy and can be reached via e-mail at
