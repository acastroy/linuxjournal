Tired of Jelly Bean on your Nexus 7? Try something else with MultiROM!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e72580.0x1f6a1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Anyone who knows me well enough knows I love mobile
devices. Phones, tablets and other shiny glowing gadgets are almost an
addiction for me. I've talked about my addiction in other articles and
columns, and Kyle Rankin even made fun of me once in a Point/Counterpoint
column because my household has a bunch of iOS devices in it. Well, I was
fortunate enough to add an Android device to the mix recently&mdash;a Nexus
7 tablet. I actually won this device at the Southern California Linux Expo
as part of the Rackspace Break/Fix Contest, but that's a different story.
</p><p>
If you've not seen a Nexus 7, it's a nice little device. Like all
&ldquo;Nexus&rdquo;-branded Android devices, it's a
&ldquo;reference&rdquo; device for Google's base
Android implementation, so it's got a well-supported set of hardware. I'm
not trying to make this article sound like a full-fledged review of the
device, but here's a few tech specs in case you're not familiar with
it:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
7" screen with 1280x800 resolution.
</p></li><li><p>
7.81" x 4.72" x 0.41" (198.5mm x 120mm x 10.45mm).
</p></li><li><p>
16 or 32GB of Flash storage (mine is the 16GB model).
</p></li><li><p>
1GB of RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
NVIDIA Tegra 3 Quad-Core Processor.
</p></li><li><p>
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and optional 3G radios.
</p></li><li><p>
Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The Nexus line of Android devices makes up the reference implementation for
Android, so that tends to be the series of device that sees the fastest
movement in terms of new builds of the OS, and in unique OS derivatives
like CyanogenMod. Right about the time I received the Nexus 7, Canonical
released the developer beta of Ubuntu Touch, which targeted the Nexus
7 as its deployment platform.
</p><p>
Because I can't leave nice things well enough alone, I decided to start
trying alternate OS ROMs on my shiny new Nexus 7. Ordinarily, each new OS
would require you to reflash the device, losing all your configuration,
apps and saved data. However, I found a neat hack called MultiROM that
lets you sideload multiple ROMs on your device. How does it work? Well,
let's walk through the installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e72580.0x1f6aae8"></a>
Prep for MultiROM Installation</h2></div></div><p>
First, and I can't stress this enough, back up your device. I really,
really mean it. Back up your device. You're messing around with lots
of low-level stuff when you're installing MultiROM, so you'll want to
have copies of your data. Also, one of the first steps is to
wipe the device and return it to an &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; configuration,
so you'll want your stuff safe.
</p><p>
Second, grab copies of the &ldquo;stock&rdquo; Nexus 7 ROMs as they shipped from
the factory. You will want these in the event something goes wrong,
or if you decide you don't like this MultiROM hackery and want to roll
your device back to a stock configuration.
</p><p>
Third, check the links in the Resources section of this article for up-to-date
documentation on MultiROM. It's possible for things to change between this
writing and press time, so follow any instructions you see there. Those
instructions will supersede anything I type here, as this kind of
hack can be a rapidly moving target. Also, do your own homework&mdash;lots of great YouTube videos describe this process,
and a video sometimes can be worth several thousand words.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Notice:</b></span> please make sure you follow these three steps, then follow the
MultiROM documentation exactly. I'm not responsible if your tablet gets
bricked or turns itself into SkyNet and goes on a rampage against
humanity. Though I have to say, if that happened, it'd be kind of neat, in
a geeky sort of way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e72580.0x1f6ae00"></a>
Unlocking Your Bootloader</h2></div></div><p>
Your device should be on the latest available factory ROM supported by
MultiROM before you begin the installation. At the time of this writing, on my
Nexus 7 (Wi-Fi-only) model, that was 4.2.2. The Nexus 7 comes from the
factory with a &ldquo;locked&rdquo; bootloader. The first thing you've got to do
is unlock the bootloader before you can proceed.
</p><p>
To unlock the bootloader, you need the Android SDK tools
installed on your computer (see the Resources section for a download
link). Specifically, you'll need the fastboot and adb tools for this,
so make sure they're on your system and in your shell's PATH environment
variable.
</p><p>
Next, hook up your tablet to your computer via the USB-to-MicroUSB cable,
and then run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
adb reboot bootloader
</pre>
</p><p>
Your tablet then will reboot, and you'll be in the Android
bootloader. Once you're in the bootloader, run the following
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo fastboot oem unlock
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you'll be prompted to confirm the command and accept that all data
on your device will be erased. The tablet then will reboot, winding up in
the setup wizard where you'll be prompted for all your setup information
as if it were fresh out of the box once more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e72580.0x1f6b170"></a>
Installing MultiROM</h2></div></div><p>
Now that your bootloader is unlocked, you can proceed to the
trickiest part of this process&mdash;installing MultiROM. Grab a
copy of it from the XDA-Developers MultiROM thread (the link is in
the Resources section of this article; currently the filename is
multirom_v10_n7-signed.zip). You'll also need to get the modified
TWRP install file (TWRP_multirom_n7_20130404.img) and a patched kernel
(kernel_kexec_422.zip). Rename the TWRP install file to recovery.img,
then hook your tablet back up to your computer, and place these files
in the root of its filesystem (keep the .zip files zipped&mdash;don't
unzip them).
</p><p>
Next, from your computer's command line, you'll need to run the adb
utility from the Android SDK again, but this time, with the proper argument
to get the system to boot to &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; mode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
adb reboot recovery
</pre>
</p><p>
This will bring the device to &ldquo;Clockwork Recovery&rdquo; mode. From the
Recovery menu on the device, choose &ldquo;Install zip from sdcard&rdquo;, followed
by &ldquo;choose zip from sdcard&rdquo;, then specify the MultiROM zip file you moved
to the root of your tablet's filesystem earlier. When it's done flashing,
select &ldquo;reboot system now&rdquo;, and your Nexus 7 will reboot.
</p><p>
Once the device boots normally, issue the following command from your
computer to get the system back in the bootloader:

<pre     class="programlisting">
adb reboot bootloader
</pre>
</p><p>
The device will reboot in bootloader mode. Select the fastboot option
on the screen, then type the following on your computer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll flash the modified recovery image that MultiROM requires to your
tablet. Next, just tell the tablet to reboot by issuing the following
command to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo fastboot reboot
</pre>
</p><p>
Your Nexus 7 now is ready to install alternate ROMs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e72580.0x1f6b7a0"></a>
Adding ROMs to MultiROM</h2></div></div><p>
Adding ROMs to MultiROM is fairly straightforward from here. Just hook
your tablet up to your computer, drop the .zip file for the ROM you
want to install onto the root of the filesystem, and then shut down the
tablet.
Restart your Nexus 7 in MultiROM by holding the &ldquo;Volume Down&rdquo;
button while pushing the power switch. You'll see a screen with what
appears to be the Android logo lying on its back (Figure 1). This
is the bootloader. Push the &ldquo;Volume Down&rdquo; button until the red arrow
at the top of the screen indicates &ldquo;Recovery Mode&rdquo;, then push the Power
button. This will boot the Nexus 7 into MultiROM.

</p></div></div><p>
Now that your Nexus 7 is actually in MultiROM, select the
&ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;
button in the lower-left corner, then select &ldquo;MultiROM&rdquo; in the
lower-right corner. Now, to install a ROM, touch &ldquo;Add ROM&rdquo; in the
upper-left corner (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11477f2.large.jpg"><img src="11477f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MultiROM &ldquo;Add ROM&rdquo; Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Accept the defaults (unless you're trying the Ubuntu Touch developer
release), and just press Next. The next screen will ask you to select
a ROM source. Touch the Zip file button, then pick the .zip file of
whatever ROM you want to install. The system will go ahead and install it,
and it'll let you know when it's complete. Push the Reboot button when
the install is complete, and your tablet will reboot into the MultiROM
selection screen (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11477f3.large.jpg"><img src="11477f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. MultiROM Boot Menu
</p></div></div><p>
Looking at my boot menu, you'll see I've got cm-10.0.0-grouper
installed, otherwise known as CyanogenMod. To boot that, I simply
touch it, then press the large blue Boot button at the bottom of the
screen. It's as simple as that&mdash;the Nexus 7 will just start booting
CyanogenMod. At one point, I had the stock ROM, CyanogenMod, AKOP
and Ubuntu Touch on my Nexus 7, all coexisting nicely (but they took
too much of my limited 16GB storage space, so I pruned back some).
</p><p>
If you decide a particular ROM isn't for you, you can get rid of it
quite easily. Just go back to the MultiROM install by booting with the
Power and Volume Down buttons depressed, then select Recovery, and press
the Power button again. Dive back into the MultiROM menus, just like
you're installing a ROM, but instead of pressing Add ROM, press List
ROMs. Touch the ROM you want to delete, and then just select Delete
from the buttons that pop up. This will let you keep your MultiROM install
clean, with only the ROMs you want to test active at any given time.

Getting Ubuntu Touch Running</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu Touch is something I've been watching closely, particularly
because I spent a little time with an Ubuntu Touch-equipped Nexus 7 at the
Southern California Linux Expo. The Ubuntu Touch developer builds can
be a little finicky, although they've stabilized in recent weeks. The
key to getting them going in MultiROM is to select the &ldquo;Don't
Share&rdquo;
radio button when adding the ROM (Figure 2). The Ubuntu Touch builds
come in two parts. Add the smaller hardware-specific zip file first
(on my Wi-Fi Nexus 7, it's quantal-preinstalled-armel+grouper.zip), but do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
reboot&mdash;go back, list the ROM again, then push Flash Zip, and select
the larger ROM file (quantal-preinstalled-phablet-armhf.zip). After that
completes, you can reboot your tablet into Ubuntu Touch. Be advised,
though, that Ubuntu Touch is under very heavy development, and sometimes
the daily builds exhibit issues&mdash;and may not work at all. Your mileage
may vary. If you do get Ubuntu Touch going, but it seems unresponsive
to touch, try sliding from the left bezel toward the center. That'll
bring up a Unity-style launcher, and things should work from there. It
took me a few tries to figure this out. I thought my Ubuntu Touch
installation was broken or that I had a bad build. It turns out, it's just a
different operating paradigm.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Nexus 7 by itself is a great, low-cost, high-power tablet. However,
thanks to its status as a reference device, there's a lot of alternate
OSes out there for it. MultiROM lets you try them all without
requiring you to wipe your device each time you want to try a new
OS or ROM build. Check it out, but back up your data, and read the
documentation thoroughly.

The programmer who wrote the MultiROM program has a great sense of
humor, and he left a &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; easter egg in the software. From the main
MultiROM boot screen, just touch the MultiROM logo, and you'll get a
proper portrait-orientation port of Pong (say that three times fast!)
