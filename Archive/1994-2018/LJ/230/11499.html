Android is a lot more free than iOS, but there are limits. We need to break
through those.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7d580.0x1b75300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At its birth, Android was the horizontal and open solution to the problem
of Apple's vertical and closed silo. On Android, hardware makers and
software writers could build devices and apps, free to operate outside the
walls of any vendor's closed garden.
</p><p>
This was fine, as long as we ignored the closed and vertical natures of
three controlling forces in Android's market space: 1) mobile-phone
companies; 2) Google's main business, which is advertising; and 3) every
e-commerce vendor, each operating its own silo. So let's visit those, in
order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7d580.0x1b75510"></a>
Mobile-Phone Companies</h2></div></div><p>
Before Android standardized a single popular platform for smart mobile
devices, the phones we got were co-silo'd by partnerships between phone
makers and phone companies. Back in the early 2000s, I sat in a meeting
where a parade of software developers presented ground-breaking ideas to
Nokia, which had invested in a number of those same developers. At the end,
one of the Nokia people explained that these were all interesting ideas,
but that the company already had worked out plans for features to be rolled
out during the next several years on the company's phones, in partnership
with the carriers. This explained why, for example, my Nokia E62 lacked the
Wi-Fi capability of the otherwise identical Nokia E61
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E61" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E61</a>). The E62 was built
for carriers in the US, while the E61 was built for various European
carriers. If AT&amp;T didn't want Wi-Fi on the E62, it wouldn't be there.
</p><p>
We can thank Apple for driving a much harder and better bargain with
AT&amp;T
than any other mobile-phone maker ever did. And we can thank Google for
making sure that the smart mobile device market had a white-box operating
system, so its hardware base could be as broad and generative as
possible.
</p><p>
But those moves did not change the nature of phone companies, or our
dependency on them. Back when JP Rangaswami
(<a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com" target="_self">confusedofcalcutta.com</a>) was Chief Scientist at BT (and
I worked for him there as a consultant), he observed that the core
competence of phone companies is billing, not telephony. This is the
biggest reason (among many others) why no phone company ever would have
welcomed, much less created, the Internet. After all, there is nothing in
the Net's protocols that welcomes, much less creates, billing
opportunities. But today most of the data paths between mobile devices and
the rest of the Internet go through phone company connections, and those
connections are built for billing. This is done through
&ldquo;plans&rdquo; for data
usage. In some cases (for example, Sprint in the US), there are plans that allow
unlimited usage. But in most cases, customers take a plan that obligates
them to pay for some number of MB or GB per month, with additional charges
for going over &ldquo;caps&rdquo;. While phone companies need to make money by charging
for services, it's an open question whether charging for data usage is the
best, or the only, billing choice. It's just one that comes easily to a
business that's already built to charge for minutes and text messages (the
latter of which cost nothing on the open Internet).
</p><p>
Mobile phone systems are also walled in other ways the open Internet is
not. For example, most data plans work only in the country where they are
bought. Cross a national border and you risk &ldquo;bill shock&rdquo; for data use,
which is charged at a much higher rate, even if you use the same company's
wireless connections. While this looks like a bug to customers, it looks
like a feature to the phone companies&mdash;and also to governments that
enjoy getting a slice of the action and never liked the borderless Internet
anyway.
</p><p>
Then there is the video issue. According to Lowell McAdam, CEO and Chairman
of Verizon, video already makes up for half the data traffic on his company's
wireless network, and will reach two-thirds by 2017
(<a href="http://variety.com/2013/digital/news/verizon-topper-try-a-la-carte-to-protect-cable-1200338345" target="_self">variety.com/2013/digital/news/verizon-topper-try-a-la-carte-to-protect-cable-1200338345</a>).
Thus, the Internet is
being turned into a distribution system for &ldquo;content&rdquo;. In terms of market
power, content producers and distributors are sure to bias the growth paths
of developers and their offerings, including Google and Android.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a7d580.0x1b75a90"></a>
Google's Business</h2></div></div><p>
Back when Google began, in the late 1990s, advertising was barely imagined
as a business model. In fact, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google's
founders, initially were opposed to advertising. But since then, Google has
become the largest company in the on-line advertising business, and
advertising is the largest percentage of Google's revenue base.
</p><p>
Most of that advertising is not of the old Madison Avenue kind, which
mostly sent brand messages out over print and broadcast media. Most of
on-line advertising today, including Google's, is descended from direct
marketing, which is descended from direct mail. It is meant to be personal,
and it is guided by data provided through personal use, whether those persons
like it or not. While Android does provide choices about privacy protection
with each app one installs, users have little if any control over what
happens to personal data that gets passed on to third parties, such as data
brokers and analytics firms.
</p><p>
Lately the tide has been turning against privacy compromises and abuses by
the on-line advertising business and the apps and services supported by it.
Although Google takes a stronger moral stance on behalf of personal privacy
than do many other on-line advertising companies, the fact remains that most
users of Android phones and tablets are Google's consumers rather than its
customers, which means those consumers are the product being sold to
Google's actual customers, which are advertisers. From Steven Levy's book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>In the Plex</em></span>: &ldquo;We don't monetize the thing we
create&rdquo;, Andy Rubin says. &ldquo;We
monetize the people that use it. The more people that use our products, the
more opportunity we have to advertise to them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Android phones also come defaulted with a pile of Google apps, placed in
privileged positions in the phone's app directory. This does not sit well
with Google's competitors. On April 9, 2013, Fairsearch, a coalition
that includes Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle, filed a complaint with the
European Commission against what it called &ldquo;Google's anti-competitive
strategy to dominate the mobile marketplace and cement its control over
consumer Internet data for on-line advertising as usage shifts to
mobile&rdquo;,
adding &ldquo;Google is using its Android mobile operating system as a 'Trojan
Horse' to deceive partners, monopolize the mobile marketplace, and control
consumer data&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.fairsearch.org/mobile/fairsearch-announces-complaint-in-eu-on-googles-anti-competitive-mobile-strategy" target="_self">www.fairsearch.org/mobile/fairsearch-announces-complaint-in-eu-on-googles-anti-competitive-mobile-strategy</a>). That's a bit hyperbolic, but I believe they have a case.
</p><p>
For our purposes in the Linux community, the main thing at issue is bias in
the evolution of Android and the apps that run on it. As long as
advertising remains Google's main business, and Android remains a Google
project, it will be hard to keep a bias toward advertising's imperatives
from having an influence.

E-commerce</h2></div></div><p>
In 1995, my wife asked a question so profound that it has haunted me ever
since: &ldquo;Why can't I take my shopping cart from one site to
another?&rdquo; The
answer is that every e-commerce site is a silo with its own shopping cart,
its own cookies for visitors, its own pile of visitor data, and its own
silo'd relationships with visitors and customers. Nearly two decades have
passed since then, and the situation hasn't changed. In fact, it is now
much worse. All of us doing business on the Net need to maintain up to
hundreds of different login/password combinations, and our relationships
with vendors are as silo'd as they ever were. The off-line world also
is infected by the same urge to entrap visitors and customers, which is why
it's no coincidence that &ldquo;loyalty programs&rdquo; requiring that we carry around
separate cards and key tags for every store chain, also began to take off
in the mid-1990s.
</p><p>
The problem here is summed up by one of my favorite slides, by Phil Windley.
It says this:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>History of E-Commerce</b></span>
</p><p>
1995: Invention of the cookie.
</p><p>
The End.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Cookies are a convention of client-server computing. While client-server
has proven to be a handy way to build the on-line world, it forecloses
countless opportunities that can be seen only from the client's
side&mdash;when the person there isn't being a client. We still don't have the
shopping cart we can take from site to site because we can't imagine doing
that inside a world where we're always the submissive party and never the
dominant one. Or even an equal. Sure, we are free to run our own servers if
we like, but that answer doesn't help. In the world of e-commerce, we are
merely clients, rather than human beings.
</p><p>
Far more can be done when we are free and independent than when we are
captive and dependent. And that's the rub here. In spite of all the good
Android has done for us as developers and users, too much of what we can do
is still trapped inside the walls of captors on which we depend, starting
with Google.
</p><p>
We need to start thinking and working outside the boxes that phone
companies, Google and client-server-based e-commerce have built around us.
Can we break out of those boxes and still be on Android? I don't have the
answer, but I am working on it. Hope you are too.
