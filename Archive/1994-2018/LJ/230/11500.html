<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #230, June 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Rob Landley</b></span> tried to remove a
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span> dependency that has cropped up
in the Linux build system...and tried...and tried. But, no one appeared to
want his patches. Even <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> argued against removing the Perl
dependency, in spite of the fact that Rob's patches replaced the code with
smaller, simpler shell scripts.
</p><p>
It's unclear what the reluctance stems from&mdash;my understanding always
has been that any chance to remove a dependency from the Linux build system was
a chance worth taking. But apparently, the top kernel developers see a value
in this particular dependency.
</p><p>
The e-mail thread was a bit of an eye-opener for me personally, because I'd
started to consider Perl to be a legacy language, with no forward progress
on Perl 6, and the language itself essentially stalled.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft's &ldquo;secure boot
mode&rdquo;</b></span> seems to be pitting kernel
developer against kernel developer successfully. <span   class="bold"><b>David Howells</b></span> recently posted some
patches to allow the kernel to load Microsoft-signed
cryptographic keys dynamically, and there was some support for the patch.
But, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> wouldn't allow it, and there was some support for his rejection of
it.
</p><p>
Linus' approach seems to be that he'll support anything that can provide
genuine security to the user. And if some new technology is not designed to
provide that security, he'll support it to the extent that it can be
torqued into a position that provides genuine security. But, he won't
support technologies that claim to add security when all they really do is
take control of the system away from the user.
</p><p>
Evidently he feels that, as designed, &ldquo;secure boot mode&rdquo; does more to take
control away from the user, than it actually does to secure the system. So
he's rejected David's patches, as well as apparently any notion of catering
to Microsoft as the sole key-signing authority for &ldquo;secure boot
mode&rdquo;
security keys.
</p><p>
According to <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> and others,
the Linux kernel's <span   class="bold"><b>hotplug</b></span> code
had been developing races, undocumented behaviors and other problems. He
posted a patch to rip the guts out of the beast and replace it with
something that, to the user, would appear as a simple state machine.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds liked the idea, but he wanted to be sure that the guts
really were fully ripped out and replaced. He didn't just want to hide the
problems. But as <span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span> pointed out, Thomas' patch represented only
the first step, in which the horror was hidden from the user. The second
step would involve cleaning up the internals themselves.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rob Landley</b></span> recently chafed at the
increased security on the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span>
server. Ever since the 2011 security breach, the kernel.org admins have
implemented tighter access controls that limit the ways in which developers
can contribute their work. Rob in particular missed the ability to rsync
his code updates to a kernel.org account. As a result, he hadn't been able
to update the <span   class="bold"><b>00-INDEX</b></span> files in the kernel
source tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Gortmaker</b></span> 
also had been updating those files, but he posted his patches to the public
mailing list instead. That seems to be the standard approach these days,
along with creating public git repositories from which Linus and others may
pull.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: libnotify, OS X Style</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #230, June 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the things I dislike about using Irssi in a terminal window on OS X
is that I often miss the screen flash when someone mentions my name in
IRC. With some fancy SSH tunneling (maybe more on that some other issue)
and a really cool pop-up notification tool, if someone mentions my name,
I can't miss it.
</p><p>
terminal-notifier is a command-line tool for creating OS X-native user
notifications. It doesn't rewrite the concept of pop-ups; instead,
it gives us nerds a way to add pop-ups to scripts (Figure 1). Because it
uses the native notification system, it's easy to modify what sort of
pop-up appears. I prefer the kind that doesn't go away until dismissed,
but you can change that in the notification settings in OS X's preferences.

Figure 1. A quick command-line-ninja move creates a pop-up.
</p></div></div><p>
If you like pop-up notifications like libnotify, but find yourself on
a Macintosh machine more often than not, terminal-notifier might be as
useful for you as it is for me at my day job. Plus, now you know that
if you mention my name in IRC during the workday, you'll make a window
pop up on my screen! Get it at <a href="https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier" target="_self">https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier</a>.

<h2 class="title">GIS with GRASS</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #230, June 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The major player in the Windows world for GIS programs is the suite of
ESRI products. In Linux, we have the package named GRASS
(<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org" target="_self">grass.osgeo.org</a>). 
GRASS originally was developed by the US Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratories, starting in 1982. It is used by many large
groups, including NASA, NOAA and the National Park Service. In September
2006, management of GRASS was taken over by the GRASS Project Steering
Committee, and it now is an official project of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf1.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Main Web Site for the GRASS Project
</p></div></div><p>
GRASS may be too much if you just want
to do basic GIS tasks. In that case, you may be better served by a
program like QGIS. But, if you need to do some serious GIS analysis,
GRASS definitely is worth the learning curve. Most distributions
should have a set of packages to simplify installation. If you do want
the latest source, or need a version of GRASS for Windows or Mac OS X,
you always can go to the main Web site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf2.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The download page provides binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
</p></div></div><p>
When you first start up GRASS, it asks you to set a data
directory. The suggestion is ~/grass-dir. Once you select
this data directory, you need to set some project information. You can
click on the Location Wizard to help set the location information
for your project. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf3.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. When you initially start GRASS, you need to select a location
and a mapset.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you set the name and data directory, you need
to select the method for creating a new location. Just to get started,
you simply can accept the defaults. To learn how to work with GRASS,
you will want to have some data to play with. Sample datasets
are available to download from the main GRASS site
(<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data" target="_self">grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data</a>).
Choose one
or more of them, download the files and uncompress them into the data
directory you set above. These sample datasets then will show up in the
&ldquo;Welcome to GRASS&rdquo; window when you first start up GRASS. At this point,
select one of these datasets. You also need to select a mapset,
most usually PERMANENT.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf4.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can use several sample data sets while you are
learning to use GRASS.
</p></div></div><p>
Once GRASS starts up, two windows appear. The first window is a map
display, where all of the layers you select will be rendered. The second
window is where you select the map layers that you want to apply to the
map display window. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf5.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. On start up, you will have a map display window and a layers window.
</p></div></div><p>
To create your first map, click on the
&ldquo;Add raster map layer&rdquo; button (the one with a checkerboard and a plus
sign), or you can press Ctrl-Shift-R. This will pop up a
dialog window where you can select which layer you want to add from
the mapset you loaded on startup. In this example, I have loaded the
PERMANENT mapset from the spearfish location, and I set the 10m elevation
as the first layer of my map.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11500grassf6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Here you select which layers to load.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf7.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Here you can see the elevation of the land in the spearfish
location.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the
first things you will want to do is to change the colors used within
the map. To do this, right-click on the layer in question, and select
&ldquo;Set color table&rdquo; from the drop-down menu. You then can change the color
table that GRASS will select from in order to render the layer on your
map. To change your layer to grayscale, select &ldquo;Type of color
table:&rdquo;
and select &ldquo;grey&rdquo;. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11500grassf8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Changing the color map is relatively simple.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click on the run button, you
are switched to the &ldquo;Command Output&rdquo; tab where the results from this
command are displayed. If you want to see an idea of the
spread of the possible values, you can get a histogram by right-clicking
the layer and selecting Histogram. If you need more exact
numbers, you actually can calculate univariate statistics on the data
in the layer. This is done by right-clicking on the layer and selecting
&ldquo;Univariate raster statistics&rdquo;. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf9.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can see the results of running the color change immediately.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf10.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

generating a histogram.

Figure 11. More detailed analysis is available by looking at univariate
statistics.
</p></div></div><p>
Adding a second layer allows you to start building up the information
being displayed on your map. You need to be careful of which order the
layers are in the layer list. They are rendered from the bottom up. This
means that layers further up the stack may obscure what is being displayed
lower down. You may need to change the opacity of the upper layers to
allow information from the lower layers to show through. Right-click on
the layer in question and select &ldquo;Change opacity level&rdquo;. You
then can set
it to an appropriate level so everything you want to see actually
is rendered. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf12.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. You may need to change the opacity of layers once you start
stacking them.
</p></div></div><p>
The other type of layer that you can add to your
map is a vector layer. In this case, the data is stored as
a set of geometrical objects, where each object has some attribute data
assigned. With vector layers, the only portions that are rendered are
the actual objects. For example, if you add a road layer, you don't need
to worry about opacity, because the roads are small enough not to obstruct
anything on the layers below. You can right-click on that layer and edit
the attribute data. You then can select which values for each attribute
to display. This can be a more complex selection&mdash;for example, selecting
those values between an upper and lower bound or selecting only those values that
match some other criterion. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf13.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. You also can load vector layers.
</p></div></div><p>
You can change display properties for the
objects by right-clicking and selecting Properties. For the road layer,
you can set properties like line width, line color and what symbols to
use for point elements. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf14.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. You can highlight elements in a vector layer.
</p></div></div><p>
You can add extra elements that you normally see on maps by selecting
the &ldquo;Add map elements&rdquo; button on the main map display. This
opens a drop-down box where you can select extra elements to add. These
include scalebars, North arrows, legends and text areas. 
You can click and drag these elements and place them where they need to
be on your map. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf15.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf15.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. You can add extra elements to your map, like a scale bar.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have the layout the way you want, you
need to save a final copy so you don't lose all of your
work. To do so, click the &ldquo;Save display to graphic
file&rdquo; button on the main map display. The first step is to choose the
output size for the map. Then you can select the filename
and the file format. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11500grassf16.large.jpg"><img src="11500grassf16.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 16. When saving a map, you need to select the output size.

Figure 18. Don't forget to quit when you're done.
</p></div></div><p>
Hopefully, this article introduces you to enough of GRASS to induce
you to try it out. If it's good enough for the US Army, it's good enough
for me. It should be powerful enough to handle any GIS task you
have.

Although it's difficult for me to look at this piece's title and not think of mutant
felines, it doesn't make the statement any less true. If you've ever used
the tail command on log files, you'll instantly appreciate multitail. My
friend (and <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> reader) Nick Danger introduced me to multitail, and I can't
believe how useful it is. multitail will &ldquo;tail&rdquo; multiple files, split
the screen to display them, notify of log file changes and so on. One of
my favorite features is rather than show 100 lines of repeated log, it
shows the line only once, and it says, &ldquo;line repeats 100
times&rdquo;&mdash;simple,
but awesome.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11500multif1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Two files at once is just the beginning; multitail is awesome
(screenshot from <a href="http://www.vanheusden.com" target="_self">www.vanheusden.com</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
multitail has more features than I could list on this page, but chances
are if you've ever wished you could do something with log files, multitail
does it. Check it out at <a href="http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail" target="_self">www.vanheusden.com/multitail</a>.

It may not be fair to call Weechat the little brother of Irssi, but in
my short introduction to it, that's what it felt like. If Weechat didn't
seem quite as powerful as Irssi to me, I definitely can say that it is
better-looking out of the box. So, little brother has one thing going for him!

The other day, I was tweeting with Janne Jokitalo about the sorts of
things two nerds tweet about: command-line editors and command-line chat
clients. I mentioned Irssi in a screen, and he mentioned Weechat. I'm
glad he did! Right out of the box, Weechat does some things I've never
been able to get Irssi to do well. First off, it has a list of users
docked to the right side of the terminal (Figure 1). I always liked
that feature in the GUI client X-Chat, but I couldn't get it to work well
in Irssi. I also think the look and feel is far more friendly 
than that of Irssi. Yes, with the help of Kyle Rankin, I've been able to
tweak Irssi into the perfect chatting machine, but Weechat seems to
have a more gentle learning curve.

Figure 1. The <span  class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> IRC bot works in Weechat,
so I was happy.

It supports IRC and Jabber right now, but the Web site claims more
protocols are coming. Weechat is probably already in your distro's
repository,
so install it, and give it a whirl. You'll get all the
geek creed of Irssi with some fancy interface additions! Due to its
focus on usability and its roots in hard-core nerd-dom on the command
line, Weechat is this month's Editors' Choice selection. Check it out at
