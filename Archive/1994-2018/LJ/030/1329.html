useful and related commands,
<span   class="bold"><b>apropos</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>whatis</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>makewhatis</b></span>. To understand why
these commands are so valuable, it helps to grasp the underlying
philosophy that continues to guide evolving versions of Unix,
including Linux. That philosophy remains one of creating small,
portable, specialized programs that perform one task well, and that
can receive input from, and redirect output to, other programs.
</p><p>This philosophy has created a proliferation of small,
powerful, but extremely limited programs. Just do a directory
listing of /usr/bin, and you'll see what I mean. And that's not all
of them. You could sit down and run every one of them to see what
they do. Or you could begin reading the hundreds of man pages
available describing these commands. No matter which method you use
to learn the commands, in the end, you'd still probably forget most
of them due to the sheer volume. So how do you know which of the
hundreds of programs available can do the job for you? Or which of
the commands will be best suited to your particular needs? apropos
and whatis come to the rescue.</p><p>Apropos, as defined by the dictionary, means &ldquo;apt; relevant;
suited to the occasion, though not strictly belonging to the
subject under consideration.&rdquo; These definitions, particularly the
last one, are totally apropos. apropos will list programs with a
one line synopsis of each program based on a keyword search. whatis
is similar, but even more constrained; i.e., the actual command is
given as the argument, rather than a keyword, so there is less
output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1365580.0x145d710"></a>makewhatis</h2></div></div><p>Before we look at how apropos can help us, we need to ensure
that the database apropos uses exists and is up-to-date. Enter
<b  >makewhatis</b>. This command creates the whatis
database files used by both apropos and whatis. They are located in
each <b  >../man</b> directory and catalog the manual
files in each of the individual cat? and man?
subdirectories.</p><p>To create the whatis database files, you need to invoke
makewhatis as the root user. Non-privileged users normally do not
have write permission in the <b  >../man</b> directories
to create the whatis database files. A second clue to the nature of
makewhatis is its location. makewhatis is usually found in the
<b  >/usr/sbin</b> subdirectory, indicating its
classification as a system administration program. Ordinarily only
root's <b  >PATH</b> environment variable contains the
sbin directories. makewhatis may be invoked by root's crontab file
and run on a recurring basis, and you may wish to include it if it
isn't already there. But that is beyond the scope of this article.
If you can log in only as a non-privileged user, or are sure your
whatis database files exist, you may want to skip ahead to the next
section. If you begin to see <b  >&lt;keyword&gt;: nothing
appropriate</b>, you'll need to have your system
administrator run makewhatis.</p><p>Running makewhatis for the first time will take several
minutes, so be patient (go have a cup of coffee). Run by itself,
makewhatis will create the whatis database file in
<b  >/usr/man</b>. To ensure that all the man locations
are cataloged, use the <b  >-w</b> switch. This will read
the file <b  >/etc/man.config</b> and use the man paths
it specifies. Or you may add paths following the
<b  >-w</b> switch and they will be used as well. If you
are want to know which paths will be cataloged, type <b  >man
--path</b>, and you will see where
<b  >/etc/man.config</b> believes your manuals are. If
you have other paths, they should be added to your man.config
file.</p><p>Another makewhatis option is <b  >-c</b>. This
switch, when used alone, will catalog only the
<b  >../man/cat</b> entries listed in
<b  >man.config</b>. Other cat subdirectories may be
added following the <b  >-c</b> switch, and they will
also be cataloged.</p><p>You may, however, want only to update the whatis databases
with newly added commands. Use the <b  >-u</b> switch to
update the database files. This switch reads the time of the whatis
database file and adds those manual pages created or updated
since.</p><p>If you want to know what makewhatis is doing, add the
<b  >-v</b> switch, and you will see each man directory
entered and each command as it is added to the list. Each switch
used with makewhatis should be separated by a space and preceded by
a hyphen; the switches cannot be combined. makewhatis does have one
weakness: if your system does not have sufficient RAM and virtual
memory, makewhatis will fail. If you get an error message&mdash;and you
are running makewhatis as root&mdash;add more swap space and try
again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1365580.0x145e000"></a>Using apropos</h2></div></div><p>To search the whatis database on your system, just
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apropos \keyword
</pre><p>inserting your criteria as the keyword for the search. Let's
try one out. I've never used my CD-ROM player for anything more
than mounting a data disk and accessing files, but I'd like to play
some music while I'm working (or playing xtetris because it doesn't
have music accompaniment, etc.). So I type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apropos cdrom
</pre><p>and I see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xplaycd (1)          - X based audio cd player for cdrom drives (END)
</pre><p>apropos uses the less pager unless your PAGER environment
variable says otherwise. To exit this screen, press q. To scroll,
use the up and down arrow keys, or the space bar to go down a
screen at a time.</p><p>Now I'm not sure, but I believe other programs for accessing
the CD exist on my system. Yes, this will work, but how about a
choice? Let's try again. This time, I'll try with just CD:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apropos cd
</pre><p>survey says:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Tcl_AsyncCreate, Tcl_AsyncMark, Tcl_AsyncInvoke, Tcl_AsyncDelete
(3) - handle asynchronous events
cd (3)              - Change working directory
curs_window: newwin, delwin, mvwin, subwin, derwin, mvderwin,
dupwin, wsyncup, syncok, wcursyncup, wsyncdown (3) - create curses
windows
eject (1)           - eject CD-ROM disc from drive
mcd (1)             - change MSDOS directory
rexecd (8)          - remote execution server
termios, tcgetattr, tcsetattr, tcsendbreak, tcdrain, tcflush,
tcflow, cfgetospeed, cfget
ispeed, cfsetispeed, cfsetospeed, tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp (2)
               - get and set terminal attrib
utes, line control, get and set baud rate, get and set terminal
foreground process group ID
tin, rtin, cdtin, tind (1) - A Netnews reader
cda (1)              Compact disc digital audio player utility
wm2xmcd (1)         - workman-to-xmcd CD database file converter
xmcd (1)            - CD digital audio player utility for X11/Motif
xplaycd (1)         - X based audio cd player for cdrom drives
</pre><p>Now we have a problem. We can be overwhelmed with
inappropriate items. If this didn't give you a long listing, try
giving cat as a keyword for apropos. You'll get pages of output.
(Read on to find out why.)</p><p>If you look, you can see that we got what we wanted, and a
whole lot more. How can we narrow it down? Can we put two keywords
on the apropos command line? Yes. Unfortunately, the keywords are
logical ORed and not ANDed together, making the output even longer.
But if we scan the listing, it appears most of the commands we're
interested in contain the term audio. We could try
<b  >"apropos audio"</b>. But let's search the previous
list instead. Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apropos cd | grep -i audio
</pre><p>Our reward:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cda (1)  - Compact disc digital audio player
utility xmcd (1 - CD digital audio player utility
for X11/Motif xplaycd (1)     - X based audio cd
player for cdrom drives
</pre><p>Now, that's more like it! We can try these programs to see
which we like best. And we know they have manual pages to help us
out.</p><p>A good exercise for the reader might be to use &ldquo;mail&rdquo; as a
keyword (this will return a very long list), then grep the list for
audio to see which programs might help you e-mail sound
files.</p><p>A slightly less obvious, but identical command for apropos
exists. The command <b  >man -k &lt;keyword&gt;</b> is
synonymous, though not as mnemonic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1365580.0x145e7e8"></a>whatis</h2></div></div><p>Finally, let's take a look at whatis. We've been accessing
the whatis database files during the apropos (aka man
<b  >-k</b>) searches. Let's try our cd search using
whatis instead.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
whatis cd
</pre><p>Now we get:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd (3)               - Change working directory
</pre><p>So what's the difference? Why only one entry? Think of the
whatis database as columnar and containing two columns. The left
column contains the program name (the command used to invoke the
program) and the right side contains the first line of the manual's
program synopsis. apropos searches both columns using the keyword
as a regular expression to find all occurrences of the keyword.
These occurrences may be embedded in the command word or the words
of the synopsis. For example, <b  >apropos cat</b>
returns lines containing the word catalog, category, duplicate,
application, etc. whatis, on the other hand, searches only the left
hand column, which contains only the program name. This feature is
helpful if you know the name of a command, but not its
function.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1365580.0x145eb00"></a>Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>These commands do have limitations. If a command has no
corresponding manual page, it will not be listed in the database.
makewhatis does not include a manual page, at least not on the
author's system. If a synopsis does not contain a keyword you have
chosen to search on, it will not show up. As with all tools, you
may need to compare the results of several different searches or
<b  >grep</b> long search results to find the best
program for your needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1365580.0x145ec60"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Now you have the tools to help find commands you may not use
often, but are worthwhile knowing. Using apropos and whatis sure
beats reading through all the manual pages. A newbie to Linux will
find a lot of directory manipulation help with the dir keyword. So
put apropos to work and search and learn!</p></div></div>
