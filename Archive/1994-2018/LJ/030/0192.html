Specialized Systems Consultants (SSC)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 0-916151-95-6</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $7.00</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> Dave
Dittrich</p><p>Back in the mid 80s, when I first pulled a Unix
workstation&mdash;an Intergraph InterPro, running System V Unix&mdash;out of
a closet at Boeing and began to teach myself Unix system
administration, I needed something to help me remember shell
command options. The first reference I bought was the System V
command reference from Specialized Systems Consultants. It sits in
my desk drawer to this day, and still sees daylight every time I'm
confronted with the question, &ldquo;What option is it that I need to
use with the <b  >foobar</b> command on a System V
system?&rdquo; This reference card cost me about $5, if I remember
correctly, which is about the same price it goes for today, ten
years later.</p><p>That SSC has produced a Java class library reference isn't a
big surprise. These references are the backbone of their publishing
business, which now extends to Linux documentation, CD-ROM software
collections, Linux and WWW magazines&mdash;even t-shirts! With the new
&ldquo;Internet runs on dog years&rdquo; world that Java exists in, I
seriously doubt if these cards will have the same shelf life as my
System V reference, but System V isn't the same as it was back
then, either. I'm sure many will find them equally useful just the
same.</p><p>Before trying to assess these new Java reference cards, I
think it's helpful to consider what these references are and are
not, and just who is likely to use them.</p><p>These reference cards are not introductory overviews of the
Java language, like the vast majority of Java books on the shelves
today. They do not include tutorials or introductory text for each
package, like O'Reilly &amp; Associates' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a
Nutshell.</em></span> They are not API documentation, like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java API</em></span> (both volumes) from
Addison-Wesley. I don't see them as being &ldquo;competitors&rdquo; with
anything else out there right now (except, perhaps, the Java API
hypertext pages themselves, which are a bit awkward to use
sometimes). So what are they, and how well do they do their
job?</p><p>The Java reference cards&mdash;one for the java.applet, java.awt,
and java.util packages, and another for the java.lang, java.io, and
java.net packages&mdash;are a concise, classified (no pun intended)
listing of the methods and important constants associated with each
class in these packages. No more and no less (well, at least not
that much less).</p><p>Together, the two references cover 38 panels. Although not
stated explicitly, they use a syntax somewhat similar to Unix man
pages, where optional parameters are surrounded by square brackets.
For example, rather than list two lines for each method signature,
like this:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>BufferedInputStream</b></span>(InputStream
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dest</em></span>);<span   class="bold"><b>BufferedInputStream</b></span>(InputStream
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dest</em></span>, int
<span   class="emphasis"><em>buffersize</em></span>);</p><p>they include just one line, like this:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>BufferedInputStream</b></span>(InputStream
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dest</em></span> [,int
<span   class="emphasis"><em>buffersize</em></span>]);</p><p>While this syntax is not exactly what you'll find in other
books on Java, you get used to it quickly, and most people will
probably appreciate the brevity it contributes to the
listings.</p><p>Each package makes up its own section, with classes within
the package in their own graphic box. This makes for a clear
delineation between classes within each package. The box titles
include only the class name. For example, just the title
<span   class="bold"><b>Class</b></span> heads a box in the
<span   class="bold"><b>JAVA.LANG</b></span> section (I'm not sure
why they're <span   class="bold"><b>YELLING</b></span>), rather than
being explicitly labeled
<span   class="bold"><b>java.lang.Class</b></span> as the compiler
will expect. In practical use it can be hard to determine exactly
what you need to import to use this class in your code. When you
are thirteen pages into the card and find the
<span   class="bold"><b>Color</b></span> class, you have to backtrack
page by page to find that <span   class="bold"><b>Color</b></span> is
in the <span   class="bold"><b>JAVA.AWT</b></span> package and know
to add <b  >import java.awt.Color;</b> (or the more
general <b  >import java.awt.*;</b>) into your code.
(This is a pretty minor gripe. If it <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span>
bothers you, you can always just write in the package name with a
pen).</p><p>Carefully going through some of the class descriptions also
brought out what appear to be a few errors of omission and one
parameter mix up. For example, in the
<span   class="bold"><b>Component</b></span> section of
<span   class="bold"><b>JAVA.AWT</b></span>, missing methods are:
<span   class="bold"><b>checkImage()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>getPeer()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>location()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>prepareImage()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>size()</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>toString()</b></span>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>repaint()</b></span> method has the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>maxWait</em></span> parameter at the end of the list, when
it should be at the beginning. Since most of these methods involve
the complicated image producer/consumer mechanism, or are accessory
functions more interesting to people programming layout managers
than those just building a simple GUI, the omissions may not matter
to the majority of Java coders. Missing from Label is
<span   class="bold"><b>addNotify()</b></span>, but the 1.0.2 JDK API
documentation itself says about this method, &ldquo;Most applications do
not call this method directly.&rdquo;</p><p>More glaring is the lack of two entire packages,
<span   class="bold"><b>java.awt.image</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>java.awt.peer</b></span>. Granted, these two
packages are more interesting to people doing quite complicated
graphics programming, or coding new AWT peers for window managers
other than the already supported Windows, Macintosh and Motif, but
they are still part of the JDK class library that a programmer may
use. The image producer/consumer paradigm is quite confusing and is
sometimes criticized as such in Java books, but if the programmer
is forced to also have handy a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a
Nutshell</em></span> to get the whole API picture, many will
probably opt to just go with the book.</p><p>The author, Randy Chapman, is intimately familiar with the
JDK through his work with the Linux port, and I know him from his
working days in the Academic Computer Center at the University of
Washington to be a very careful and thorough programmer. I am not
sure if the omissions are due to working with an older API or if
the idea was to simplify things for the average programmer or
perhaps just the result of time pressures. (He is, after all, still
a student with educational demands high on his priority list. I
won't fault him for that.) Since it isn't stated explicitly, I will
assume that the aim is to simplify the card and conclude that the
target audience will be the beginning to intermediate programmer
who sticks to coding &ldquo;average&rdquo; Java applications or applets and
not the kind of Java fanatics who think triple tall espressos
should be purchased in pairs. (These people would prefer to write
Perl scripts to extract this information directly from the JDK
source code tree and run the results through nroff!)</p><p>Overall, these cards are quite handy to have lying next to
your keyboard and will prove to be well worth the small price that
SSC charges for them. I wish more books had this high a
usefulness-to-price ratio.</p></div></div>
