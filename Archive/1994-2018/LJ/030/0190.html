    It isn't about Linux. Or is it?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c2298"></a></h2></div></div><p>I had planned to write this column about
what has been happening with Linux since 2.0 was released. I was
going to cover the updates, as of today, to Linux 2.0.7. But, I
forgot&mdash;updates in a stable chain are uninteresting, as they are
just bug fixes.
</p><p>Fortunately, three pieces of news caught my eye, and I now
had topics that are both current and of interest. But, it isn't
about Linux. Or is it?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c23f8"></a>Where is UnixWare Headed?</h2></div></div><p>First, for newcomers to the Unix racket, UnixWare is a
product of Unix Systems Labs (USL). AT&amp;T sold USL to Novell and
last year Novell sold USL to SCO. So, UnixWare is what remains of
what many considered &ldquo;Real Unix&rdquo; from AT&amp;T.</p><p>In the ITbits newsletter published by Implements, Inc.,
Norton Greenfeld comments that the UnixWare Technology Group (UTG)
is being dissolved. SCO (the guys who now own UnixWare) will form
an internal group to take its place. What's wrong with this? UTG
was reasonably independent, and its decisions had to do with the
entire Unix industry. Independence is no longer the case, as SCO
has just put themselves in the position of being on all sides of
any decisions. For later reference, note that a little company in
Redmond named Microsoft owns a reasonably-sized chunk of
SCO.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c2558"></a>On to Windows NT</h2></div></div><p>I just received a release (called an alert) to journalists
and analysts from Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly &amp; Associates titled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NT Workstations 4.0: Bad News for Web Servers</em></span>.
The title immediately got my attention, but it turns out that
rather than a warning that NT Workstations 4.0 will destroy your
web site, it was a call for political action. The gist of the alert
is that this new version of NT is designed to limit performance so
that you can't use it as a web server. This means you will have to
purchase NT Server (for $999 instead of only $290 for NT
Workstations) if you want to run a web server. Tim goes on to quote
web site developer Bob Denny: &ldquo;When I first started developing web
servers in 1994, nearly all web serving was done on the Unix
platform. Considering that companies such as O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, Netscape and half a dozen more, pushed hard in the
fight to legitimize NT vs. Unix as a web server platform over the
last 18 months, Microsoft's actions are pretty extreme.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c26b8"></a>What Does This Have to Do with Linux?</h2></div></div><p>In case you haven't caught on to where I am going with
this&mdash;it isn't where Tim was going. He thinks this is bad; I think
this is an opportunity. A few days ago I was talking to a vendor of
Alpha systems running Linux. He told me that even Digital was
surprised at the number of systems he was selling. Many of these
systems are for web servers.</p><p>Linux people, now is the time to strike. Linux is a great
operating system for web servers. Our own web server is a
486DX4/100-based Linux system. Our site has grown in popularity to
around 80,000 hits a day, and the server continues to perform
flawlessly. By the time you read this we should have the secure
version of the Apache server running on it.</p><p>For a higher-powered web server an Alpha-based Linux system
offers more performance at a lower cost than NT. In other words,
everything that NT can do can also be done by this system.</p><p>We have a chance to show the big guys that we know what we
are doing. Selling a Unix-like platform to the Internet community
isn't hard. After all, the Internet grew up on such
platforms.</p><p>When MS-DOS was the $100 answer against the $1000 Xenix
answer, people were picking MS-DOS. Note that I am ignoring
capabilities and performance. Capabilities and performance seem to
seldom enter into mass marketing efforts anyway. (Remember Beta
VCRs offered superior performance at the same cost.)</p><p>Today the game is different. While Microsoft is trying to get
$1000 out of your pocket, Linux offers a much less expensive
alternative that generally performs as well or better.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c2978"></a>Remember DR DOS?</h2></div></div><p>DR DOS is/was the MS-DOS-like system that was developed by
Digital Research. It was bought by Novell, had a significant
following for a while and then faded away over the last two
years.</p><p>Well, Caldera just acquired DR DOS from Novell, where
&ldquo;just&rdquo; means July 24. What does this have to do with Linux? A
lot. Aside from the fact that Caldera is a Linux company, part of
the DR DOS package was a lawsuit (filed on July 23) against
Microsoft.</p><p>Microsoft is accused of &ldquo;illegal conduct ... calculated and
intended to prevent and destroy competition in the computer
software industry.&rdquo; Of particular interest to the Linux community
are the deals that Microsoft has cut to get OEMs to include MS-DOS
with the computer. While I doubt anyone reading this is very
excited about having DR DOS as an alternative to MS-DOS on their
new system, this action could open the way for other operating
systems (for example, Linux) being more widely available. (For more

Sell Linux. By that I mean talk to
your boss who is considering setting up a web server. Talk to your
ISP. Point them to some examples.
(<a href="http://www.ssc.com" target="_self">www.ssc.com</a> is our
web server, but don't stop there. Our ISP, running Linux systems
can be found at
<a href="http://www.aa.net/" target="_self">www.aa.net/</a>.
And there are certainly more.)</p><p>There may be a lot of copies of software by Microsoft out
there, but Linux is a significant influence on the Internet and now
is a good time for us to make sure it stays that way.</p></div></div>
