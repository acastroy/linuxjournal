    In much the same way that the various political parties in the

    want to define what democracy really is, software politicians want to
    define what free software really is.

that it never went away. In much the same way that the various
political parties in the United States want to define what
democracy really is, software politicians want to define what free
software really is.
</p><p>While the majority of the users of free software (whether it
be GPLed, public domain, BSD licensed or any of the other free
classes of software) are happy to use it and appreciate that it
exists, there is a minority who have their own political agenda.
And the one at the top of the minority list is Richard M. Stallman
(commonly known as RMS), creator of the Free Software
Foundation.</p><p>Most Linux users are aware of the GNU project of the Free
Software Foundation the people who have made a huge contribution to
the Linux effort through the creation of programs like Emacs and
gcc. But not many people know that the GNU project was supposed to
turn out a complete Unix-like operating system, including a kernel
called The Hurd.</p><p>RMS approached <i  >Linux Journal</i> almost two
years ago and told us that we should refer to what we call Linux as
GNU/Linux. While we all recognize the contribution that the GNU
project has made, we declined to make this change, as it is our job
to report what is happening, not to create news (something that
many other magazines along with newspapers and TV news programs
could learn from).</p><p>Stallman's latest idea is to rename Linux as Lignux. (I would
have included particulars from the opinion RMS wrote, but it is
under a copyright that allows verbatim copying only, and it is
longer than the space allotted here. The gist of his stated opinion is that the GNU project has
been working for 12 years to make something like what Linux is
today, that Linux is based on GNU, and that the GNU project was
built from other free software including X Windows, TeX and BSD
network utilities. He then concludes that these components together
make up what is called the GNU system.</p><p>Using this same logic we could say that we have combined the
GNU system, the Linux kernel and other free software to produce
what is called the Linux system. If fact, we do say it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100e580.0x11065b0"></a>What Went Wrong?</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps RMS is frustrated because Linus got the glory for
what RMS wanted to do. Linus managed to get more people working
together for free to produce a commercial-grade finished product.
While Linux didn't start out to be put under GPL license teRMS,
Linus decided that was the right thing to do. Rms should see this
as a serious conversion&mdash;it's like Linus found religion. Linux
isn't a threat or a competitor; it is RMS's biggest success.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100e580.0x11066b8"></a>What's All the Fuss About?</h2></div></div><p>Or, put another way, why am I taking up all this space to
discuss this matter? Because a split between FSF-supporters and
Linux-supporters just doesn't benefit anyone in the free software
community. It doesn't benefit any consumers of software&mdash;free or
otherwise. In fact, it only benefits companies like
Microsoft.</p><p>I have been a supporter of the Free Software Foundation for
years: SSC continues to sell FSF books (none of which have ever
been profitable for us, but have helped the FSF), and I have little
disagreement with what RMS has to say. However, I do have a problem
when he feels that everyone has to believe exactly the same things
he does. I want Bill Gates to yield to the pressure of a successful
free software movement and make his software freely available,
rather than let him watch the infighting in the free software
community over which type of free software is best.</p><p>I see two driving forces that have made Linux a success: it's
good, and it exemplifies the right attitude. While the BSD crowd
has been busy with infighting, and the Free Software Foundation has
been trying to define what 'free' really is, the Linux community
has been writing code and building a complete and successful
package.</p><p>This attitude is what has made commercial vendors see Linux
as a viable platform for their products. We've seen you can't go
wrong if you buy IBM and then you can't go wrong if you buy
Microsoft. Neither of these may have been the best answer, but both
were safe answers. Linux is becoming successful in commercial
markets, because once again, it offers a safe answer.</p><p>While I don't have a formula that will make all this go away
(so we can get back to development on the best operating system
around that just happens to contain software from various sources
including the Free Software Foundation), I would like to offer one
final opinion; this one is from Darin Johnson's Usenet posting,
where he says, heck, you can do whatever you want with my posting.
I think it offers another way to look at what is happening:</p><p>Finally, to quote someone I think we all know: &ldquo;Umm, this
discussion has gone on quite long enough, thank you very much. It
doesn't really matter what people call Linux, as long as credit is
given where credit is due (on both sides). Personally, I'll very
much continue to call it <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span>.&rdquo;</p><p>Relax, Linus&mdash;so will we.</p></div></div>
