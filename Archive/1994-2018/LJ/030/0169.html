    Currently the most popular use of Java seems to be in
    building Applets. In this article Paul shows you not only
    how to make a applet, but how to make it look good.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef0580.0x1fe8500"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you were awake this past year then
you've probably heard of Java. If you were browsing the World Wide
Web with a recent version of Netscape then you've probably even
seen a Java applet or two. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java applet</em></span> is a
Java program that interfaces with and endures the security
restrictions of a <a href="0169l2.html" target="_self">web browser</a>.
Animated displays and games were some of the earliest and most
popular uses for applets, although certainly not their only uses.
You may have already noticed that, despite the popularity of Java
animation, many applets don't do animation very well.
</p><p>In order to illustrate beginning Java programming and
animation techniques, I wrote a very simple slot machine in Java,
its only moving part a lone, spinning wheel. To start, I will
present a slot machine that uses one of the simplest and
(unfortunately) most popular methods of animation. This slot
machine won't look very good, but making it look better is not very
difficult, and I'll present several methods for improving it. The
source, images and actual incarnations of the slot machines
described in this article are available at
<a href="http://k2.cwru.edu/~ptb/lslot/" target="_self">k2.cwru.edu/~ptb/lslot/</a>.
I recommend that you experiment with them as you read this.</p><p>This slot machine is composed of two images. The
<a href="0169f1.html" target="_self">first image</a>--the body of the slot
machine&mdash;is really just a decorative so I have chosen our good
friend and potential Linux mascot, Tux. The
<a href="0169f2.html" target="_self">second image</a> is really a strip of
images that forms the face of the slot machine's wheel
(<a href="0169f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a>). We could load each of
these images separately but that would probably slow down the
loading process and complicate the code. These images are loaded
inside the <b  >init()</b> method through a call to
<b  >getImage()</b>, a method defined in the superclass
<b  >Applet</b>.</p><p>If you know C++ (or Java) you might notice that
<b  >init()</b> functions a lot like a constructor, i.e.
it is used to initialize variables for a newly created object.
There is a big difference however, in that a constructor is called
when the class is instantiated, <b  >init()</b> is called
when the applet's host is ready to initialize the applet. Moving
the <b  >getImage()</b> code discussed above from
<b  >init()</b> to a constructor could cause it to
break.</p><p>When the applet's host finally decides to display the applet
it will call <b  >paint()</b>. Looking at
<b  >paint()</b> you should notice that it gets passed a
variable <b  >g</b> of type <b  >Graphics</b>,
it is with this variable <b  >g</b> that you will do your
drawing. In fact, all the drawing that an applet ever does is
through some instance of <b  >Graphics</b>. The first
line of <b  >paint()</b>,</p><p><b  >g.drawImage(body, 0, 0, this);</b></p><p>will draw the image <b  >body</b> at position 0, 0.
The fourth argument to <b  >drawImage()</b>,
<b  >this</b>, specifies an
<b  >ImageObserver</b>, <b  >this</b> is simply
a reference to the current object.</p><p>An <b  >ImageObserver</b> is an instance of any
class that implements the java.awt.image.ImageObserver interface,
meaning that it has been declared to implement
<b  >ImageObserver</b> and has a method
<b  >imageUpdate()</b>. In the following example, an
instance of the class Foo would be a valid
<b  >ImageObserver</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Foo extends Object implements ImageObserver
{        ...
        public boolean imageUpdate(Image img, int flags,
          int x, int y, int w, int h) {
                ...
                return true;
        }
}
</pre><p>Interfaces provide a limited, yet safe and usable form of
multiple inheritance. Fortunately,
<b  >java.awt.Component</b>, an ancestor of the
superclass, <b  >Applet</b>, is already an
<b  >ImageObserver</b> so no code needs to be written
here.</p><p>If the image is not yet fully loaded the system will make
note of the <b  >ImageObserver</b>. Later on when more,
but not necessarily all, of the data is ready,
<b  >imageUpdate()</b> will get called. By default, the
<b  >imageUpdate()</b> method for an applet will call
<b  >repaint()</b>, which causes the &ldquo;visual loading&rdquo;
effect where the image gets painted as the data is loaded.</p><p>The next thing that <b  >paint()</b> does is create
a new <b  >Graphics</b> specifically for drawing the
wheel on the slot machine. This is accomplished by a call to
<b  >createForWheel()</b>, a method that I added. As
mentioned, all drawing is done using a <b  >Graphics</b>,
and every <b  >Graphics</b> has a rectangle somewhere on
screen or in memory, to which it can draw. If a command such as
<b  >drawImage()</b> involves drawing outside this
rectangle, the part that extends outside the rectangle is clipped.
This is very useful if we only want to display a portion of an
image.</p><p>The <b  >createForWheel()</b> method creates the
new <b  >Graphics</b> by a call to the
<b  >create()</b> method of the
<b  >Graphics</b> that was passed to
<b  >paint()</b>. Four integers are passed to
<b  >create()</b> which specify the location and size of
the new <b  >Graphics</b>'s rectangle&mdash;in this case, the
position and size of the wheel. Now that we have this new
<b  >Graphics</b> we can do things such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
drawImage(strip, 0, -55, this)
</pre><p>Even though <b  >strip</b> is over 500 pixels tall
and the specified coordinates put it in the upper left-hand corner,
a nice 55 by 55 pixel square (the size specified when creating the
<b  >Graphics</b>) shows up at the position specified for
the wheel that displays rows 55 through 110 of the image
<b  >strip</b>.</p><p>Once the new Graphics is no longer needed, its
<b  >dispose()</b> method should be called. This probably
seems a little odd since Java has automatic garbage collection
(meaning that memory does not have to be explicitly freed as in C
or C++). The reason for calling <b  >dispose()</b> anyway
is that Garbage collection is not immediate and the
<b  >Graphics</b> could be in possession of limited
system resources.</p><p>This slot machine, like most, does not spin its wheel all the
time. In fact, its wheel only spins in response to a mouse button
click and then only for a short time. Looking at the
<b  >mouseDown()</b> method you can see that it simply
creates a new <b  >Thread</b> called &ldquo;spinning&rdquo;. When a
thread is started it calls the <b  >run()</b> method of
the <b  >Runnable</b> (another interface) object
specified in the thread's constructor. In this case the object is
this applet, <b  >this</b>.</p><p>The slot machine's exciting spinning action is implemented in
<b  >run()</b>. The first thing that
<b  >run()</b> does is to ask
<b  >getNewItem()</b> where it's going. The
<b  >getNewItem()</b> method just returns a random number
from 0 to 5 specifying the stopping item on the wheel. The
<b  >run()</b> method then calculates how far, in pixels,
the wheel must travel to get there, including the number of items
that should spin past the front before the wheel stops. After this
<b  >run()</b> simply loops until the wheel reaches its
destination. Calculate the new position, repaint, sleep, repeat.
Once finished <b  >run()</b> just sets
<b  >spinning</b> to <b  >null</b> so that
clicking the mouse button again starts the wheel spinning, and
<b  >run()</b> returns.</p><p>Try the applet! Looks awful, doesn't it? Probably the most
obvious defect is the ugly grey flashing that appears while the
wheel is spinning. Fortunately, this problem is very easy to
fix&mdash;every time <b  >repaint()</b> is called the system
asynchronously calls <b  >update()</b>.
<b  >update()</b> is an inherited method (defined all the
way back in the class java.awt.Component) that draws a rectangle
the size of the applet using the background color and then calls
<b  >paint()</b>. This rectangle draw is the source of
most of the flicker&mdash;since we are going to immediately draw over
the whole region of the applet it is not only annoying but
unnecessary. To fix the flicker, just insert the following method
in the space between <b  >createForWheel()</b> and the
<b  >paint</b> methods (see
<a href="0169l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public void update(Graphics g) {
        paint(g); }
</pre><p>Now run the applet&mdash;doesn't it look much better? However, if
you look closely you might notice that the wheel has a slight black
flicker, and the animation is a little rough. This problem is
similar to the previous one&mdash;the body of the slot machine, which
just has a black square where the wheel should be, gets drawn
before the wheel graphic. so for an instant there isn't any wheel.
One popular solution for this problem is double buffering: using an
off-screen buffer to hold the image while it is being drawn. Now
the part of the body hiding behind the wheel will never
appear.</p><p>To add double buffering to our applet, the first thing that
you must do is create a buffer, called (appropriately enough)
<b  >buffer</b>. Next add an <b  >Image</b>
instance variable called <b  >buffer</b> into the class
and insert into the <b  >init()</b> method the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
buffer = createImage(size().width, size().height);
</pre><p>Now <b  >paint()</b> must be modified so that it
will first draw into the buffer and then draw the buffer itself
onto the screen. This new <b  >paint()</b> should look
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public void paint(Graphics g) {
       Graphics bufG = buffer.getGraphics();
       bufG.drawImage(body, 0, 0, this);
       Graphics clipG = createForWheel(bufG);
       drawWheel(clipG, currentWheelPos);
       clipG.dispose();

       g.drawImage(buffer, 0, 0, this);
}
</pre><p>Now run the applet&mdash;looks much nicer, no more flicker! But it
seems awfully inefficient to redraw the entire area of the applet
window when only a small part is changing, doesn't it? Another easy
fix! Simply change the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
repaint();
</pre><p>found in <b  >run()</b> into:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
repaint(wheelPosX, wheelPosY, wheelSize, wheelSize);
</pre><p>This new call tells the AWT system to update only the
specified rectangle and leave the rest of the window alone.</p><p>It seems that, as before, we are drawing the body of the slot
machine more often than needed, only this time it's to the buffer
instead of the screen. It's possible to work up a scheme where only
the wheel gets repainted to the buffer, fixing this complaint, but,
as you may have already realized, there is a better way.</p><p>This buffer is silly, not only is it starting to get
complicated but having some big <b  >Image</b> in memory
is a big waste, especially for more complex applets (such as a big,
complex, slot machine). Buffer images have their place but
buffering the whole applet is rarely a good idea. Why not just
forget about using repaint and instead draw the spinning wheel
right inside of <b  >run()</b>? Good idea. Going back to
the code that we had before adding in that buffer, modify
<b  >run()</b> as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public void run() {
        // Gets something to spin to.
        int nextItem = getNewItem();
        int pos = currentWheelPos;
        int finalPos = (itemsToSpin + nextItem) *
                wheelSize;
        Graphics g = createForWheel(getGraphics());
        while((spinning != null) &amp;&amp; (pos != finalPos))
      {
                pos = findNextPos(pos, finalPos);
                currentWheelPos = pos % stripLen;
                drawWheel(g, currentWheelPos);
                getToolkit().sync();
                try {
                        Thread.sleep(delay);
                } catch(InterruptedException e) { }
        }
        g.dispose();
        spinning = null;
}
</pre><p>Now we are simply getting the <b  >Graphics</b>
that we need to draw the wheel and calling
<b  >drawWheel()</b> directly every time we move the
wheel. The trick here is to call</p><pre     class="programlisting">
getToolkit().sync();
</pre><p>when we want the drawing to appear. Without the call to
<b  >sync()</b> the system would wait until several
drawing requests arrive, resulting in jumpy animation.</p><p>Finally the slot machine is finished! I think you can see
that although the code is almost identical to that of the first
slot machine, the resulting animation is much smoother.</p><p>For more complex animations you will probably want to use a
combination of the methods presented here. For example, let's say
you want to create a box with two balls bouncing around inside. In
most cases you will simply have a <b  >drawImage()</b>
for each ball, but what happens if the two draws overlap? You may
end up with flicker in the area of intersection. One solution would
be to double buffer the draws whenever the two images
intersect.</p><p>As usual, if you are having a hard time with some aspect of
your applet you can (hopefully) find an applet that does something
similar and look at the source. The largest collection of Java
applets can be found at Gamelan
(<a href="http://www.gamelan.com" target="_self">http://www.gamelan.com/</a>),
you should also find a link to the winners of the Java Cup
International there. Another good place to find applets is the Java
Applet Rating Service (JARS) at
<a href="http://www.jars.com/" target="_self">www.jars.com/</a>.
As the name implies, the Java Applet Rating Service rates applets
based on a number of factors including quality of code (if the code
is freely available).</p></div></div>
