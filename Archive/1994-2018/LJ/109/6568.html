    Starting with the 2.5 series, it's simpler and faster to
    customize your kernel or add a driver.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x17895b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The process of building a kernel has two
parts: configuring the kernel options and building the source with
those options. In versions before the 2.5 kernel, configuration was
driven by a Config.in file within every subdirectory and a main
help file, Documentation/Configure.help. The language used to
describe the build process was based loosely on a shell-style
language that would control which configuration options were
presented to the user, depending on which options were currently
presented.
</p><p>This worked reasonably well, but over time the variety of
different options in the kernel stretched the language beyond what
it could reasonably handle. In the 2.5.45 kernel release, Roman
Zippel's rewrite of the configuration language and configuration
programs was placed in the main kernel tree. The new configuration
language is much more flexible and powerful. It also unifies the
help text with the configuration logic, making it easier to apply
patches for individual drivers, without having to worry about
conflicts within a single Configuration.help file.</p><p>Also during the 2.5 series, Kai Germaschewski and the other
kbuild developers slowly reworked makefile logic within the kernel,
making it easier to build the kernel based on the selected options.
This article describes the format of the makefile and configuration
files in the 2.5 kernel and shows how to add a new driver to the
build process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x1789768"></a>Configuring the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>To configure different kernel options, a user runs either a
text-mode or a graphical kernel configurator. The text-mode
configurator can be run with <b  >make config</b> and
prompts the user to select configuration options in order (Figure
1). The ncurses text version is more popular and is run with the
<b  >make menuconfig</b> option (Figure 2). The graphical
configurator is run with <b  >make xconfig</b> and uses
Qt as the widget set (Figure 3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6568f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

config</b>

back up and correct mistakes.

Figure 3. The Qt-Based <b >make xconfig</b>
</p></div></div><p>When the kernel configurator is run, it reads the main kernel
configuration file, located in arch/i386/Kconfig for the i386
platform. Other architectures have the main configuration files
located in their main directories. This main configuration file
then includes other configuration files from the different
subdirectories in the kernel directory tree. Those configuration
files also can include other configuration files as needed. For
example, the arch/i386/Kconfig file contains the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
source "sound/Kconfig"
</pre><p>which will read information from that file. This
sound/Kconfig file then includes a lot of other files:
<pre     class="programlisting">
source "sound/core/Kconfig"
source "sound/drivers/Kconfig"
source "sound/isa/Kconfig"
source "sound/pci/Kconfig"
source "sound/ppc/Kconfig"
source "sound/arm/Kconfig"
source "sound/usb/Kconfig"
</pre>


The sound/usb/Kconfig file describes all of the ALSA USB driver
options, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ALSA USB drivers
menu "ALSA USB devices"
    depends on SND!=n &amp;&amp; USB!=n

config SND_USB_AUDIO
    tristate "USB Audio/MIDI driver"
    depends on SND &amp;&amp; USB
    help
      Say 'Y' or 'M' to include support for
      USB audio and USB MIDI devices.
endmenu
</pre>


The # character can be used to comment Kconfig files. Anything
written after it on the same line is not read by the configurator,
but it is useful for documenting what the file is for and what it
should do.
</p><p>The menu and endmenu commands tell the configurator to
declare a new menu level or new screen in some of the configuration
programs. On the menu line, the name of the menu should be
specified within &ldquo; characters. For this file, the menu is called
<b  >"ALSA USB devices"</b>.</p><p>Menus and configuration options can be controlled to display
or not. In this example, the USB option menu is only displayed if
the CONFIG_SND and CONFIG_USB options are selected, which is
controlled by the line <b  >depends on SND!=n &amp;&amp;
USB!=n</b>. To help decrease the amount of typing involved,
all configuration options automatically start with CONFIG, which is
not used within the configuration language. The valid states for a
configuration option are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>y&mdash;the option is enabled.</p></li><li><p>n&mdash;the option is not enabled.</p></li><li><p>m&mdash;the option is set to be built as a
module.</p></li></ul></div><p>If both the CONFIG_SND and CONFIG_USB options are not set to
n (meaning they are set either to be built in to the kernel or to
build as a module), the CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO option is presented to
the user. This option can be set to one of the three values, and it
is described as a &ldquo;tristate&rdquo; value. The text that should be shown
to the user is <b  >"USB Audio/MIDI driver"</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tristate "USB Audio/MIDI driver"
</pre><p>The valid values for describing a configuration variable are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>bool&mdash;the variable can be set only to y or
n.</p></li><li><p>tristate&mdash;the variable can be set to y, n or
m.</p></li><li><p>int&mdash;the variable can be set to any numeric
value.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>This configuration option is controlled by a depends logic
line, which follows the same logic as a menu option. The
CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO option depends on both the CONFIG_SND and
CONFIG_USB options, meaning that if one of these options is set to
a module, then the CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO option also should be set
to a module. If both of the controlling options are not enabled
(meaning both are set to n), this option will not be displayed. If
both of these options are set to y, this option can be selected as
n, y or m. All of this is defined with the simple line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
depends on SND &amp;&amp; USB
</pre><p>Within the kernel code, the configuration variable will be
seen (the CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO in the above example), so the code
can test for it or any other kernel configuration option's
existence. However, using <b  >#ifdef</b> within a .c
file to test for different configuration options is against the
kernel-style programming guidelines, which I covered in my article
&ldquo;Proper Linux Kernel Coding Style&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, July
2002,
<a href="../099/5780.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5780</a>].
Instead, limit the use of #ifdef to .h files, keeping the .c files
cleaner and easier to read.
</p><p>Previously, the help text for a configuration option was
placed in one big Configuration.help file. Now the help text is
placed right after the depends line within the Kconfig file. It
begins with a line containing either <b  >help</b> or
<b  >---help---</b>, followed by a number of lines of
help text that are indented two spaces from the help line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x178ac08"></a>Adding a New Configuration Option</h2></div></div><p>To add a new configuration option, simply add new lines to an
existing Kconfig file, in the same location as a related
configuration option. For example, if a new USB sound device driver
is written for the ALSA sound system, it would go into the
sound/usb directory, and the sound/usb/Kconfig file would be added.
This new device driver controls the mythical FooBar USB speaker
device. It depends on having the CONFIG_SND and CONFIG_USB options
enabled in addition to the CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO option, as the new
driver uses some functions found in that driver. The new
configuration option should be placed after the SND_USB_AUDIO
option but before the closing endmenu command, and it would look
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
config SND_USB_FOOBAR
    tristate "USB FooBar speaker device driver"
    depends SND_USB_AUDIO
    help
        Say Y here if you want to use FooBar USB
        speaker device.
        This code is also available as a module
        (= code which can be inserted in and
        removed from the running kernel whenever
        you want). The module will be called
        usbfoobar.o.
</pre><p>This option will now show up when the SND_USB_AUDIO option is
selected (Figure 4).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x1b831c8"></a>Building the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The kernel is built with a system of individual makefiles
that are all linked together when the kernel is built, forming a
large makefile. The individual makefiles do not look like any
standard makefile, but instead follow a special format that is
unique to the kernel build process. The makefile needs to build
only the necessary files, depending on the configuration options
enabled, in the proper format (as modules or built in to the
kernel). As an example, drivers/usb/misc/Makefile in the 2.5.59
kernel release looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#
# Makefile for the rest of the USB drivers
# (the ones that don't fit into any other
# categories)
#
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_AUERSWALD)  += auerswald.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_BRLVGER)    += brlvger.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_EMI26)      += emi26.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_LCD)        += usblcd.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_RIO500)     += rio500.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH) += speedtch.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_TEST)       += usbtest.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_TIGL)       += tiglusb.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_USS720)     += uss720.o
speedtch-objs := speedtouch.o atmsar.o
</pre><p>The line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_LCD)        += usblcd.o
</pre>


builds the usblcd.c file into a module if the CONFIG_USB_LCD
configuration option is set to m. Otherwise, it is built into the
kernel directly if that configuration option is set to y. This step
is all that is necessary to add to a kernel makefile if the module
is made from only a single .c file.
</p><p>If the driver consists of multiple .c files, the name of the
files needs to be listed on separate lines, along with the name of
the module that this driver is called. In the previous example
file, this listing of file and driver names looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH) += speedtch.o
</pre><p>and
<pre     class="programlisting">
speedtch-objs := speedtouch.o atmsar.o
</pre>


The first line controls whether the speedtch module is built. If it
is, the line indicates whether it is compiled into the kernel or
stands as a module. The second line explains that the speedtouch.c
and atmsar.c files will be built into .o files and then linked
together into the speedtch.o module.
</p><p>In older kernels, if a file exported symbols, it needed to be
explicitly mentioned in the kernel makefiles. In 2.5 and later
kernels, that mention is no longer necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x1b83590"></a>Adding a New Driver to the Build Process</h2></div></div><p>To add a new driver to the kernel build process, a single
line needs to be added if the driver is contained within a single
file. Based on the previous example of the FooBar USB speaker
device, the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
obj-$(CONFIG_SND_USB_FOOBAR) += usbfoobar.o
</pre><p>is added to sound/usb/Makefile.
</p><p>If the driver is contained in two files, such as foobar1.c
and foobar2.c, an additional line needs to be added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
usbfoobar-objs := foobar1.o foobar2.o
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1691580.0x1b837f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The kernel configuration and build process in the 2.5 kernel
is much simpler and more flexible than in the previous kernel
versions. Thanks go to Roman Zippel and Kai Germaschewski for doing
the work to make it easier for kernel developers to focus on
writing code and not have to worry about the intricacies of the
kernel build process.</p><p>A good resource for more information on the specifics of the
