    Sometimes being the can-do person is a good thing, and
    sometimes it's not&mdash;advice for when the project rests on
    your shoulders.

of articles that reflect one of the tenets of the open-source
philosophy&mdash;doing it yourself. Sometimes, however, we aren't doing
things ourselves because we want to, but because it's our job and
someone else waited too long to do his or hers. Other times, we are
forced to find some way to pull it all together or watch as the
whole process grinds to a halt. Out of necessity comes ingenuity,
and that's most likely to be true if you're adaptable, which is one
of the reasons why knowledge of Linux can be such a handy tool in
your arsenal. From the articles I've seen lately, it seems that if
you know Linux and open source, people are coming to you for help
whether you want them to or not.
</p><p>In &ldquo;Installing Slash for a Private Project&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6674.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6674</a>),
Paul Barry shares his tale of finding a way for an academic
department to schedule meetings, decide on topics and record
opinions and responses. To meet the department's asynchronous
needs, Paul chose to use the Slashdot framework, Slash, installed
locally. His article walks readers through the setup process,
including installing the database back end, Apache with mod_perl
support and all their dependencies. As always, Paul is humble
enough to share his mistakes so you can avoid making the same
ones.</p><p>If you're a system administrator, one of the most frustrating
parts of your job may be dealing with people who expect you to
reinvent the wheel on a day's notice. In &ldquo;Configuring a Virtual
Server Instance for Quick Recovery&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6531.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6531</a>),
Jeffrey McDonald explains how he took advantage of VMware's disk
modes, in both the server and workstations, to provide a new
development/test environment in a day and a half. As he says,
&ldquo;It's cool to be able to run multiple instances of virtual servers
on a single Linux host server, but easily being able to manage or
back out changes to the OS and applications within the virtual
server instances is even cooler.&rdquo;</p><p>On the other end of the do-it-yourself spectrum, in a place
we might call fun, is music&mdash;specifically, the theremin. Almost
everyone wants to play some sort of instrument well. I'm still mad
at my five-year-old self for refusing piano lessons. But the
theremin offers us all a chance to make music in one of the most
unique ways imaginable. To make it even easier, Seth David Schoen
offers the &ldquo;Poor Man's Theremin&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6597.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6597</a>),
which &ldquo;turns a laptop computer with an 802.11b card into a
theremin-like instrument, using the signal strength reported by the
card to control the pitch of a note&rdquo;. Your coworkers and friends
may complain, but at least they'll leave you alone for a
while.</p><p>The weather is starting to break here in Seattle; we've
already had a couple of those clear sunny days that exist to let
you know there is more than work in life. So while we encourage
everyone to take a break from the screen and keyboard&mdash;get crazy
and go outside&mdash;we thank you for sharing all your stories and wait
to see what you are up to next. Keep us posted at
