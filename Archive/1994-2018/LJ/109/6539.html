</p><p>Free Software Foundation, 2002</p><p>ISBN: 1-882-11498-1</p><p>$24.95 hardcover</p><p>This collection of 21 essays written by Richard M. Stallman
between 1984 and 2002 ranges from historical milestones, including
the GNU Manifesto, to transcripts of some recent speeches. The
introduction is by Lawrence Lessig, Professor at Stanford Law
School.</p><p>Most of this material is available on-line, but there are a
couple of reasons to buy the book: First, the profits go to the
Free Software Foundation. Second, having all the essays in one
place, with cross-references, updates and notes from Stallman
himself, helps readers see the big picture.</p><p>Lessig's introduction provides the right start by pointing
out that if the Free Software movement is new, radical or
revolutionary, it is because it brings to software the freedoms
already present in the pre-software world. For example, laws and
legal briefs are Free as in Freedom.</p><p>The grouping of the essays shows how Stallman himself and the
movement in general have been forced to evolve over time. In the
beginning it was &ldquo;only&rdquo; about the freedom to program, which a
minority of people needed when computers were not widely
available.</p><p>Today, almost everybody's entertainment, work, education and
free speech rights depend on computers. The essays in the second
and third parts of the book cover why the DMCA and similar efforts
are harmful to citizens' rights and a market economy.</p><p>In less than 200 pages, we go from &ldquo;GNU will remove
operating system software from the realm of competition&rdquo; to the
problems of copy-restricted media.</p><p>A lot of details on how this evolution happened are provided,
with several repetitions. Sometimes, these are even funny: the
history of the Xerox printer, whose proprietary driver made
Stallman mad enough to start the whole thing, is told so often that
one can picture proprietary software executives cursing Xerox for
not just giving him the darn code.</p><p>Coverage of one fundamental issue, free file formats, is
missing. Stallman wrote a 2002 essay called &ldquo;We Can Put an End to
Word Attachments&rdquo; that addresses this need, but it's not in the
book.</p><p>In general, the book is necessary reading and not only for
programmers. I personally disagree with Stallman on certain
conclusions and am still trying to decide whether I accept some
others or not. But it is crucial that everyone thinks about these
problems today, builds his or her own conclusions and follows them.
Even if you reject all Stallman's ideas, you must know why, and
this book will help.</p><p>&mdash;Marco Fioretti</p></div></div>
