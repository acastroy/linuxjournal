honorable lineage in the history of computers. Early experiments in
digital sound synthesis took place at the famous Bell Labs, where a
team of researchers centered around Max Mathews created the Music N
series of audio synthesis software, culminating in Music V in 1969.
Since that time, Music V has evolved into a series of notable
digital sound synthesis environments, such as Csound, Cmix/RTCmix
and Common LISP Music. These environments typically provide the
user with a language for specifying the nature of sonic events,
such as musical notes or sampled sounds. These languages usually
present users with a distinction between instruments (the
sound-producing designs) and scores (event characteristics, such
as, start time, duration and synthesis parameters). Users compose
their instruments and scores in their preferred SWSS language and
then feed them to the language's compiler. Output is directed to a
file, which then can be played by any sound system supporting the
file format or, with sufficiently powerful hardware, the output can
be directed to a digital-to-audio converter for rendering real-time
audio output.
</p><p>A standalone software synthesizer (softsynth) substitutes
real-time control for the score aspect of the model above.
Softsynths typically come with attractive GUIs, often emulating the
appearance and operation of a hardware synthesizer, and a MIDI
keyboard or external sequencer is the expected controller. Under
the right circumstances, a softsynth can be controlled by a
concurrent process. For example, using the ALSA aconnect utility, a
softsynth can be wired to a MIDI sequencer running on the same
machine. Then, sequences can be recorded and played via the
softsynth, eliminating the need for an external synthesizer and
containing the MIDI environment on a single computer.</p><p>A softsynth can be dedicated to a particular synthesis method
(additive, subtractive, FM, etc.), or it can be open-ended and
modular. In short, additive synthesis works by summing sine waves
with varying frequencies, amplitudes and phases until the desired
sound is attained. Additive synthesis is a computationally
expensive synthesis method with a formidable amount of detail
required for realistic sounds. Subtractive synthesis begins with a
sound source rich in frequencies (such as a sawtooth wave or
noise), then filters frequencies out until the desired sound has
been sculpted from the original source. Subtractive synthesis is
relatively easy to implement in hardware and software, and its
sounds are characteristically associated with the analog
synthesizers of the 1970s. FM (frequency modulation) synthesis
works by shaping the frequency components of one oscillator by the
output of another, creating complex audio spectra with little
computational expense. Yamaha's DX7 synthesizer is the most famous
FM implementation, and the company's OPL3 sound chip is certainly
the most infamous.</p><p>Physical modelling and granular synthesis are two more recent
synthesis methods. Physical modelling synthesis models the
mechanics of a real or imaginary instrument and the physics of its
activation. The method's parameters are based less on familiar
sono-musical models, such as waveforms, frequencies and amplitudes,
and more on the characteristics of physically excited systems, such
as airflow through a tube, the vibrations of a plucked string or
the radiating patterns of a struck membrane. Physical modelling has
become a popular synthesis method and is deployed in synthesizers
from Korg, Yamaha and others. Granular synthesis creates sounds by
ordering sonic quanta or grains into more or less dense sonic
masses. Again, its parameters are not so intuitive as in the older
synthesis methods, but it is powerful and can create a wide range
of sounds. Granular synthesis has yet to find its way into a
popular commercial synthesizer, but hardware implementations are
found in the Kyma system and the UPIC workstation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b67c0"></a>Synthesizer Architectures</h2></div></div><p>A softsynth can be dedicated wholly to a single synthesis
method, it can be a hybrid of two or more methods, or it can take a
more open-ended modular design. Each architecture has its
strengths. Broadly speaking, the modular design is perhaps the most
flexible, but it may sacrifice fineness of control (resolution) for
generality of purpose. A dedicated-method softsynth lacks the
modular synth's flexibility but usually provides much finer
parameter control.</p><p>Modular synthesizers encourage a building-block approach by
providing separate synthesis primitives for connection in arbitrary
ways. For example, an oscillator's output can be directed to the
input of an envelope generator (EG) or vice versa, routing the EG's
output to an oscillator input. This kind of black box networking
lends itself to software emulation, as we'll see when we meet some
modular synths later in this article.</p><p>The distinctions between the general types of software are
blurring. For example, Csound is now available with a set of
FLTK-based widgets for user-designed control panels. Many users
already have created elaborate GUIs for Csound's various synthesis
methods, some of which are detailed enough to function as
standalone Csound-based softsynths. This trend is likely to
continue with GUIs evolving for the Common LISP Music and RTCmix
SWSS environments.</p><p>Graphic patching SWSS environments like jMax and Pd are
another indicator of this blurring tendency. They also provide
graphics widgets that can be used to construct synthesizer
interfaces, but unlike Csound, these widgets are an integral aspect
of the basic working environment. jMax and Pd utilize a unique
combination of graphics and language primitives that are patched
together by virtual wires to create a synthesis or processing
network. These environments certainly can be employed as
softsynths, but their generality of purpose places them closer to
Csound than to the softsynths reviewed here.</p><p>Beatbox-style synths are yet another softsynth design
category. These programs combine elements of a synthesizer, a drum
machine and a sequencer for an all-in-one accompaniment package,
though the more sophisticated examples are truly more flexible
music composition systems.</p><p>These distinctions are brief, but for this article they
suffice to indicate the basic types of softsynths. For complete
definitions of the various synthesis methods and synthesizer
architectures, see the standard references listed in
Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b6a80"></a>Plugins</h2></div></div><p>If you've ever used Adobe Photoshop or The GIMP, you're
already familiar with the concept of plugins. For normal users, a
plugin architecture extends a program's capabilities without
requiring an update or a recompile. For applications programmers, a
plugin architecture allows them to concentrate on the basic design
of their programs, letting the plugins provide more extended or
advanced features.</p><p>Musicians working with Windows/Mac audio software can use
plugins written to the Steinberg VST and Microsoft DirectX plugin
APIs. Linux does not directly support either of those APIs,
although we shall see an indirect method of support that does work
under WINE. However, Linux audio developers have come up with their
own native plugin architecture called the Linux Audio Developers
Simple Plugin Architecture (LADSPA). The LADSPA API has become a
standard, and support for it is now an expected aspect of almost
any new Linux audio application. Some outstanding collections of
LADSPA plugins are available that include not only the typically
expected effects and DSP but also synthesis building blocks
(oscillators, envelope generators, filters, etc.) and even some
fully formed plugin synthesizers. There are some notable non-LADSPA
plugins too.</p><p>Peter Hanappe's iiwusynth is a lightweight synthesizer that
uses SoundFonts as fuel for its synthesis engine. Given a decent
set of SoundFonts, iiwusynth's output is very good, and it has
become popular as an embedded synth in many applications. It also
can be used as a standalone synthesizer from the command
line.</p><p>RX/Saturno is another lightweight plugin synthesizer that
emulates the popular Yamaha DX7 FM synthesizer. Developer Juan
Linietsky has indicated that RX/Saturno is still in the initial
development stage, but it already is quite useful and can be
employed as a plugin synth in any program supporting the ALSA
sequencer.</p><p>Kjetil Matheussen's vstserver is interesting software that
uses the capabilities of WINE to fool VST plugins into believing
they're working in their native Windows environment. In most cases,
performance is excellent, at least as good as under Windows. Kjetil
also has written two clients for the server, one to hook VST
plugins into Pd and one for LADSPA. The vstserver also supports
some VSTi plugins, which are fully formed instruments such as
synthesizers, samplers and MIDI sequencers wrapped into the VST
plugin architecture.</p><p>Although LADSPA is an effective and popular standard, the
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; aspect of its design prohibits certain kinds of
processing and control. LADSPA plugins themselves do not permit
direct parameter control via MIDI; though the plugins are quite
usable in a MIDI sequencer such as MusE. Once again, the Linux
audio development community has risen to the challenge with a new
proposed standard called XAP. The API is in the design stages, but
the team working on XAP includes the LADSPA designers and other
talented Linux audio programmers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b6d40"></a>Get ALSA</h2></div></div><p>The MIDI input hardware is typically a MIDI synthesizer
keyboard, but any MIDI instrument can be used. Connection to a
standard sound card requires a MIDI interface cable. OSS/Free and
ALSA support MPU-401-compatible devices, so some standalone MIDI
cards will work also. ALSA provides direct support for serial port
and USB MIDI devices (I have not tested those connections myself)
as well as the very useful virmidi virtual MIDI ports.</p><p>On the software side, the basic OSS/Free Linux sound system
(the kernel sound system) is sufficient for working with the
softsynths described here, but the recommended system includes the
ALSA library and drivers, the JACK audio connection kit and a
hardware MIDI input device. For best response, the kernel should be
compiled for low latency, optionally with the preemptive kernel
patch. The real-time clock (RTC) should be enabled also.</p><p>As of the 2.5 kernel development track, the OSS/Free sound
system has been officially replaced by ALSA. Stable kernels from
2.6 onward will build only the ALSA system, which does have an
excellent OSS/Free emulation layer for compatibility with
non-ALSA-aware applications. Kernels earlier than 2.5 include the
OSS/Free system, so users of those kernels must build and install
ALSA themselves. ALSA has been designed for the kind of
interconnectivity common to a modern sound system. ALSA provides
API support for plugins, an advanced audio client/server
architecture and a set of utilities to ease system configuration
and management.</p><p>4Front Technology's proprietary OSS/Linux also works well
with Linux softsynths, though obviously it can't take direct
advantage of a network of ALSA sequencer clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b6f50"></a>Knowing JACK</h2></div></div><p>JACK is a recursive acronym for the JACK Audio Connection
Kit. It has been designed for low latency professional-grade
performance as a software bus for the connection of out-of-process
audio applications. JACK is somewhat similar in purpose to sound
servers such as the aRts server for KDE or GNOME's esd, but JACK
has been designed as a more robust solution incorporating pro-audio
standards. Programs playing on the JACK bus can route their audio
I/O freely between one another, permitting complex scenarios, such
as routing the output of a MIDI-controlled softsynth into a
hard-disk recorder while applying modulated plugin effects, all in
real time with low-latency. Though a relative newcomer to the Linux
audio world, JACK already has caught the attention of many
developers and users, and we are rapidly approaching the point
where its deployment and use will be a matter of course for Linux
audio programmers and normal users alike.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b7058"></a>The Testing Environment</h2></div></div><p>The testing hardware included a generic machine with an
800MHz AMD Duron CPU, 512MB RAM and a 15GB IDE hard disk. The audio
hardware consisted of two sound cards, a SoundBlaster SBLive Value
and a SoundBlaster PCI128; a Casio CZ101 synthesizer was used for
external MIDI keyboard input. I used Steve Ratcliff's pmidi MIDI
file player, and I also employed a second computer running
Voyetra's Sequencer Plus Gold under MS-DOS. The video system
included a generic 19" monitor and a Voodoo3 graphics card. Audio
output from the sound cards ran to a Yamaha DMP7 mixer then out to
a 100-watt QSC power amplifier and a pair of Yorkville Sound YSM-10
reference speakers.</p><p>The low- and middle-level software included Linux kernel
2.4.5 patched for low latency, the ALSA 0.9.0rc6 package (audio
library, drivers and utilities), the latest JACK and the LADSPA
plugin sets from Richard Furse and Steve Harris. Other support
software included Maarten de Boer's alsamixergui and Bob Ham's ALSA
MIDI patch bay, both of which provide GUIs (and more) for the ALSA
alsamixer and aconnect utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b71b8"></a>Running Softsynths as Root?</h2></div></div><p>Many of the synths profiled here include the recommendation
to be run with root permissions, either as root yourself or by
making the binary suid root. Doing so usually ensures a higher
priority for the running application but is also considered a
serious security risk if the user is on a network.</p><p>Apart from the security issues, I should explain that when a
real-time process runs away from the root user the outcome is not
pretty, and your machine may lock up entirely. In one test while
running as root user, simply specifying an unrecognized MIDI device
froze my system. So be warned. Running as root can indeed enhance
performance, but you also are running risks. Run normal
applications as a normal user as much as possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b7318"></a>The Linux Softsynth Roundup</h2></div></div><p>The Software Synthesis section of the Linux Sound &amp; Music
Software site includes a subsection of Softsynths &amp; Samplers.
More than 30 URLs are currently active, taking you to a variety of
software synthesizers. Table 1 has pruned some of that variety by
focusing on synthesizers capable of polyphonic (plays many notes at
once) real-time output, ignoring off-line synthesizers and
environments such as Csound or RTCmix. Due to their real-time
nature, I have included beatbox programs and the MAX-like
environments of Pd and jMax.</p><p>

Roundup</p></div></div>
</p><p>Because this article is a roundup and not a shoot-out, I'll
profile only some selections from Table 1 and prune it a bit more.
The profiles represent a cross section of the various synthesis
methods, but I have purposely focused on the standalone
softsynths.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b7688"></a>amSynth</h2></div></div><p>Nick Dowell's amSynth is an excellent representation of the
dedicated subtractive synthesis architecture. The signal flow is
fixed in a classic design. The output of the two oscillators is
routed through a filter and an amplifier, then that signal can be
given to the effects (amSynth provides reverb and distortion)
and/or modulation stages for final processing before heading to
your sound card digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In classic
synthesis, the main parts of this design are referred to as the VCO
(voltage-controlled oscillator), the VCF (voltage-controlled
filter) and the VCA (voltage-controlled amplifier).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6320f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. amSynth
</p></div></div><p>amSynth includes some great-sounding presets. No General MIDI
patch is set to support the General MIDI standardized map of
instruments, but it does respond to incoming MIDI Program Change
messages. Because amSynth is essentially a standalone single
instrument that handles only one MIDI channel at a time, it is
perhaps best used as a lead or pad instrument. It can be driven by
a MIDI sequencer.</p><p>The full name for amSynth is Analogue Modelling Synthesizer.
There are no real voltage-controlled components, so we might
rightly wonder if Nick has been able to achieve his goal of
modelling the sound of an analog subtractive synth. I'm happy to
report that the sounds from amSynth are fat and lively, but you
need not take my word for it. The excellent demos on the amSynth
home page show off its sounds far better than I can describe
here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28b79f8"></a>ALSA Modular Synth</h2></div></div><p>Dr Matthias Nagorni has written a variety of useful
applications and utilities for ALSA, JACK and LADSPA; however, his
current crowning achievement must be his wonderful ALSA Modular
Synthesizer (AMS). This software emulates the great modular synths
of yesteryear, providing the user with a large selection of modules
to choose from.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6320f2.large.jpg"><img src="6320f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. ALSA Modular Synth (AMS)</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 2 illustrates AMS in its most basic form. In a
subtractive synthesis patch, the routing essentially is identical
to that used by amSynth, but the difference lies in the greater
flexibility of AMS. Unlike the fixed design of amSynth, AMS is
completely flexible with regard to the connections between its
various modules.</p><p>Most modules cheerfully accept arbitrary input connections
and have little or no concern for the destination of their own
outputs. But beware; when modules are connected in atypical
configurations, the output can be quite unusual or even
overpowering, so take care with your system volume control when
testing such patches. Each module has its own dialog (shown in
Figure 2), which is opened by right-clicking over the module's
name.</p><p>Dr Nagorni supplied the following informative notes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>AMS implements special features to ensure that
all three major synthesis methods [additive, subtractive, FM] can
be easily used with it. The module Dynamic Waves implements
additive synthesis of up to eight oscillators in one single module.
Each harmonic can be shaped with an eight-point envelope, and the
envelopes are graphically visualized. To enable easy access to
integer harmonic tuning, useful for FM, VCOs have an additional
harmonic and subharmonic slider. There is also the required linear
FM input port. For subtractive synthesis to work properly, it is
crucial that control voltages obey the classical logarithmic
convention of 1V/Octave. This way, you can move the filter cutoff
wherever you like, and you can still have perfect VCF tracking. Log
Frequency is also useful at other places, including vibrato with an
LFO.</p></blockquote></div><p>AMS has been designed for real-time work. It is especially
well-suited for MIDI control, and most parameters can be linked to
a MIDI controller for real-time changes. AMS can be used equally
well as a monophonic or polyphonic synth, and multiple instances of
AMS may communicate over JACK to create a multi-timbral setup. Its
support for the LADSPA plugins extends its already rich feature
set, making AMS an ideal solution for those of us without access to
a hardware synthesizer. A complete MIDI composition environment can
be built from nothing more than a reasonably fast machine, one of
the fine Linux MIDI sequencers, such as MusE or Rosegarden, and
AMS.
</p><p>Some setups will work better than others, so the good doctor
has prepared a healthy supply of sample patches for your study and
experimentation. You can hear some of them in the demo files
available from the AMS home page, but as with all the synths
profiled here, I suggest you download and install it yourself to
see and hear what really it can do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28ae808"></a>SpiralSynth Modular</h2></div></div><p>First there was SpiralSynth, then there was the SpiralLoops
program, a cool looping sequencer, and then there was the
SpiralSynthBaby, designed to be a plugin for SpiralLoops. Finally,
developer Dave Griffiths decided to roll all of them into one
open-ended modular synthesizer construction kit called SpiralSynth
Modular (SSM). Like AMS, SpiralSynth Modular provides the user with
a canvas and a palette of modules for placement and connection on
the canvas, but SSM has its own unique design and sound-producing
capabilities.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6320f3.large.jpg"><img src="6320f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. SpiralSynth Modular</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 3 shows off SSM running its first tutorial patch. This
example shows a simple type of synthesis called wavetable
synthesis. The wavetable is a predefined stored waveform (sine,
square, triangle, pulse, etc.) that is triggered by the virtual
keyboard and modified by the envelope generator before heading out
to the sound card DAC through the OSS output module. In the
example, we can see that the synthesizer is played through the
computer keyboard, but SSM also provides a MIDI module for
receiving and routing MIDI messages. The keyboard module is a nice
touch, and I had great fun with it playing SSM from my laptop's
QWERTY keys.</p><p>SSM does not function as a native ALSA sequencer client, so
it cannot be wired directly to an ALSA port like amSynth or AMS.
However, it can be hooked to the standard OSS/Free MIDI device
(/dev/midi) for input from any hardware or software connected to
that device. If your machine has no MIDI hardware, you can employ
ALSA's virmidi virtual MIDI ports by setting the MIDI channel to
the appropriate port in the SSM Options (/dev/snd/midiC1D0 for my
laptop; see Figure 4). This enables connection to other ALSA-aware
processes through aconnect or the ALSA patch bay.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6320f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. SSM Options
</p></div></div><p>Dave Griffiths has thoughtfully provided some excellent demos
of the synth on the SSM home site. Its FLTK interface is pleasant
and easy to use, the program includes a generous share of
interesting and useful modules, including LADSPA support, and the
latest version can be built with support for JACK. Dave plans to
include a much-improved plugin version of SpiralLoops for a
soon-to-arrive version of SSM, and we can expect more direct
support for ALSA as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28aede0"></a>RTSynth</h2></div></div><p>Stefan Nitschke's RTSynth is one of my favorite softsynths.
It is another excellent example of the patcher synth. A main canvas
is presented, iconic modules are deposited and connected together
on the canvas, and right-clicking on a module opens a dialog for
editing its parameters. RTSynth is the only softsynth represented
here that creates its sounds via physical modelling.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6320f5.large.jpg"><img src="6320f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. RTSynth
</p></div></div><p>Physical modelling synthesis is capable of extremely
realistic sounds. Some of RTSynth's patches are quite convincing.
The examples on the RTSynth home page show off some amazing
acoustic and electric guitar sounds in full arrangements with bass,
drums and keyboards. RTSynth is a multi-timbral softsynth, complete
with drumkits and effects processing, and the demos really showcase
its capabilities as a single-solution softsynth.</p><p>RTSynth is ALSA- and JACK-aware. It is fully MIDI-capable
under ALSA and the older OSS/Free kernel sound modules. On systems
lacking the ALSA drivers, it is still possible to connect RTSynth
to external processes, such as a concurrently running MIDI
sequencer via the UNIX mechanism known as a named pipe. A named
pipe provides an easy method of interprocess communication for
programs that may have no other way to share data. Using RTSynth as
an example, here's how you set up a named pipe.</p><p>First, create the pipe with the mkfifo utility:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkfifo $HOME/tmp/midififo
</pre><p>Next, prepare RTSynth for receiving data from the pipe:
<pre     class="programlisting">
RTSynth &lt; $HOME/tmp/midififo
</pre>


Finally, you must indicate the named pipe as the preferred output
device for the driving application. In the following example, I've
used Simon Kagedal's clavier virtual keyboard:
<pre     class="programlisting">
clavier -o $HOME/tmp/midififo
</pre>


Now you can play RTSynth directly from the virtual keyboard. You
also can use a normal, unnamed pipe to route the output from a
process into RTSynth using this type of command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat foo | RTSynth
</pre>


These connectivity strategies are particularly effective in the
absence of MIDI hardware and/or the ALSA virmidi driver.

recording system, but he also has given us the Bristol Synthesizer
Emulator. This softsynth provides GUIs and synthesis engines for
emulations of the Mini Moog, Moog Voyager, Sequential Circuits
Prophet-5, Roland Juno-6 and Yamaha DX7 synthesizers. It also
provides graphic interfaces and engines for the Hammond B3 and Vox
Continental organs and the Fender Rhodes electric piano. Bristol
even emulates a generic mixing board and the Yamaha Pro10 digital
mixer, but they were not tested for this review.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6320f6.large.jpg"><img src="6320f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Bristol</p></div></div>
</p><p>As shown in Figure 6, the GUIs are nicely drawn, but they are
more than mere eye candy. Nick has emulated the controls and
functions found on the original synths as much as possible;
however, not all of a particular synth's features may be
implemented yet, and Nick notes that some emulations (notably the
DX7) still need some work. Meanwhile, all those switches and knobs
and wheels can be flipped, twirled and rotated in real time with
smooth response and fast parameter updates. Bristol accomplishes a
rather daunting task by providing not only the look-alike graphics
for its variety of synthesizers and keyboards but the sound-alike
synthesis engines as well.</p><p>Running Bristol with <b  >./startBristol -v -h</b>
lists the runtime options to give the synth a wide degree of
performance customization. For example, I started Bristol with
<b  >./startBristol -alsa -seq -bufsize 2048 -voices
6</b>, which launches Bristol in its default Mini Moog mode,
declares ALSA as the driver source, registers Bristol with the ALSA
sequencer, sets the sound-card buffer size (the default value is
1,024, but Nick recommends 2,048 for my SBLive) and restricts the
polyphony to six voices (Bristol's default polyphony is 16 voices).
Incidentally, Bristol can be run in multiple instances with
simultaneous control, effectively letting you layer synths exactly
like we did in the old days.</p><p>I would need much more space to describe each of Bristol's
interfaces adequately. The example I've placed at
<a href="http://www.linux-sound.org/sounds" target="_self">www.linux-sound.org/sounds</a>
demonstrates only the Mini Moog emulation, but it should give you
an idea of what you can expect from this synth engine&mdash;some
old-school synthesizer fun.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28af888"></a>Ultramaster Juno6</h2></div></div><p>This synth is an excellent example of an emulated hardware
synthesizer. The Juno6 keyboard and panel controls are faithfully
rendered, and like the Bristol synth, all controls are active and
available for manipulation at any time. I've owned a Juno6, and
Ultramaster's audio emulation is quite faithful to the original,
but with the stability of intonation of a digital synth. Best of
all, the arpeggiator works. Those of us who remember such amenities
probably will have great fun with this feature; alas, arpeggiators
are not so common anymore, so newbies can expect to while away many
an hour finding interesting and fun uses for this function.</p><p>

</p><p>The Juno6 is a straightforward implementation of subtractive
synthesis, lending itself to sounds with dramatic filter sweeps. A
short example WAV file can be found on the Ultramaster home page,
but you'll learn more about the synth's sound and capabilities
simply by playing around with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28afbf8"></a>ZynAddSubFX</h2></div></div><p>Paul Nasca's ZynAddSubFX is an interesting hybrid of additive
and subtractive synthesis, with an added effects section for
further processing. If that's all ZynAddSubFX offered, it still
would grab your attention. An excellent FLTK interface invites
experimentation with the various parameters of the synthesis
strategies, and as an ALSA-aware client, you can drive the synth
from your favorite MIDI sequencer. Figure 8 shows ZynAddSubFX
working with the pmidi MIDI file player. It also shows
ZynAddSubFX's Scales dialog opened to a collection of tunings from
the Scala program. Selecting a new scale automatically updates the
current patch's tuning, which invites exploration of unusual
intonations and induces some interesting changes upon familiar
material.</p><p>

</p><p>ZynAddSubFX is multi-timbral, with a different instrument per
MIDI channel, making it another good choice for an all-purpose
softsynth (minus drums, alas). Its sounds are created by
straightforward synthesis methods, but the deployment of those
methods and the program's excellent interface combine to help make
some fine sounds. Performances can be recorded directly within
ZynAddSubFX, and the developer has placed several demos on-line
that depict the synth's power as a standalone multi-timbral
softsynth. ZynAddSubFX is the newest softsynth profiled here, but
its development is steady. As this article was being written, I
learned that ZynAddSubFX is now JACK-aware (Figure 8), so with
support for scales and tunings from Scala, the ALSA sequencer
client configuration and JACK connectivity, this synth is a fine
representative example of modern Linux audio software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27be580.0x28aff68"></a>jMax and Csound</h2></div></div><p>I know I promised to steer clear of profiling the more
language-based synthesis environment, but I also mentioned the
blurring tendency occurring with developments in those
environments. jMax rapidly is evolving into a rich multimedia
composition/processing suite, but it also can be utilized as a
straightforward SWSS toolkit. Figure 9 illustrates a simple jMax
synthesis patch, complete with self-documentation. Although this
example is itself trivial, jMax is capable of far more complex
synthesis patches.</p><p>Figure 10 demonstrates Istvan Varga's csoundfltk (a Csound
package optimized for Linux) running ImproSculpt, a real-time
sampler with a rather complex FLTK graphic interface. This example
is not really a synthesis patch, but it shows off the power of the
Csound FLTK widget set that lets users design GUI panels and
control systems for their Csound synthesis and processing designs.
Other examples demonstrate Csound as a straightforward synthesizer,
and interested readers should check out the material available at
<a href="http://www.csounds.com" target="_self">www.csounds.com</a> for
more examples of the FLTK/Csound powerhouse.</p><p>

check out some of the profiled softsynths yourself. I can wax
enthusiastic here in print, but the real proof is in the hearing.
So go forth, download and install some of this software, and make
some joyful noises. I'll be listening.</p><p><a href="6320s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
