Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The position focused on systems
programming, but ultimately, the environment rubbed off on me. I
learned a lot about nuclear power as well as the more antisocial
aspects of nukes. And, I recognized a problem. Any number of issues
came to mind: operational danger, waste disposal and life-cycle
cost are the first three. In any case, I knew nuclear power was not
going to be, as President Eisenhower had said 20 years before,
&ldquo;too cheap to meter&rdquo;.
</p><p>I wanted to make sure everyone learned what I had regarding
the issues of nuclear power. But, I also wanted everyone to learn
all that I had learned about alternative energy sources such as
solar, biomass and wind.</p><p>I quickly found I could not deal with both issues.
Understanding and teaching about alternative energy is a huge job,
as is pointing out flaws in nuclear power. So, I chose. Because of
all I had learned at Hanford, I felt I was more qualified to talk
about the problems of nuclear-power generation.</p><p>This was my choice for &ldquo;preventing bad&rdquo;. The more knowledge
I could disseminate, the more likely it would be that the general
population would see the issues, get involved and, in the long
term, prevent the US from jumping deeper into the nuclear
well.</p><p>Unfortunately, new &ldquo;bad&rdquo; appeared. As photovoltaics became
cheaper, utility companies lobbied to make it harder for customers
to sell power back to the grid. Once it was proved that intertie
systems to sell power back to the utilities were safe and
effective, utilities came up with rate schedules where the power
you sold back was at a lower price than the power they sold you,
even though peak output of solar systems corresponded with very
high demand. They wanted to use the law to escape the consequences
of failure by making intertie systems pay to decommission failed
nuclear plants.</p><p>Now, back to software. When I first saw Linux (back when
kernel versions started with a dot), I merely was looking at
alternatives to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; UNIX systems. We had been in business
publishing pocket reference cards and doing training and consulting
on UNIX systems for about ten years.</p><p>I decided Linux was a lot more than simply a hobby project. I
felt it showed great promise, so we changed direction from being a
UNIX company to being a Linux company. With over 100 issues of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> under our belt, I feel we made
the right choice.</p><p>Early on, a lot of my energy went into telling people about
the virtues of Linux. Much like telling people that nuclear power
costs too much, this was a hard sell at first. People didn't want
to hear that Linux might be a better choice than what they were
working with.</p><p>Now the days of telling people that Linux is a serious
contender in the OS business are gone. Even if you still don't have
it on your desktop, it is unlikely you will sit down for a web
surfing session without getting involved with some Linux
server.</p><p>The problem is that much like solar panels on your roof are a
threat to the nuclear power industry, Linux is a threat to the OS
status quo. One can spend a lot of time and energy counteracting
the FUD.</p><p>As Linux is proving to be a worthy alternative, the same sort
of &ldquo;it works but you can't put it here&rdquo; arguments are appearing
as they did with intertie systems. They merely go by different
names: DMCA and bogus software patents are two of those names. As
with nukes and solar energy, competition is fine, but what we see
is the use of the legal system to harass promising new
alternatives.</p><p>This work of &ldquo;preventing bad&rdquo; needs to be done. But, the
alternative is simply to keep on truckin' with Linux&mdash;continuing to
identify places where Linux solves a problem and moving ahead with
the solution. So many places have either a time-consuming manual
system or a poorly implemented, non-Linux system that people easily
can make a career of problem solving with Linux.</p><p>The Linux movement needs both. Someone has to deal with FUD,
and someone needs to move Linux into new places. To go back to my
nuclear power analogy, if no one were out there developing
alternative energy technology, there would be no alternative to
nukes, no matter how bad a picture the antinuke activist
painted.</p><p>As for me, I did my time dealing with the FUD. A lot of it
was fun work, but I have pretty much moved into the &ldquo;just do it
with Linux&rdquo; camp. I would rather show someone a solution and let
them choose than spend my time counteracting anti-Linux
propaganda.</p><p>I moved to Costa Rica over a year ago. On my one-year
anniversary I was thinking about how things have been different.
Aside from the more obvious&mdash;things like I really need to be
working on my Spanish&mdash;the biggest difference I have seen is that
people are more open to solutions. There is less disposable money
here than in the US and less anti-Linux FUD. Thus, it is easier
here to listen to someone's problem, propose a Linux-based solution
and have them accept it than in the US. It is easier to think Linus
was right about World Domination&mdash;except that the US might be the
last country to get Linux.</p><p>By the way, besides being Linux-friendly, all electricity in
Costa Rica is produced from renewable sources including hydro,
geothermal, wind and solar. Maybe these two issues fit together
more than I thought.</p></div></div>
