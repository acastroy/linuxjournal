    For precision of text manipulation and description, it's
    hard to beat the power of regexps.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c48580.0x1d405b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imagine you are looking for a name in a
telephone directory, but you can't remember its exact spelling. You
can spend ages searching through all the possible combinations,
unless you have a tool that extracts the relatively small number of
options that matches your search, however incomplete it may be.
Regular expressions are such a tool.
</p><p>Roughly speaking, a regular expression (or regexp) is a
string that describes another string or a group of strings. Several
applications can profit from this ability: Perl, sed, awk, egrep
and even Emacs (try Ctrl-Alt-% after reading this article) to name
a few.</p><p>In fact, many of you already have used some sort of regular
expression. In the shell command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls *.pl
</pre><p>the characters *.pl act as a regular expression. That is, it
is a string that describes all the strings composed by any number
of characters of any kind (*), followed by a period (.), followed
by two given characters (pl).
</p><p>The standard set of rules used for composing regular
expressions is able to describe all strings, no matter how
complicated they are. Unfortunately, life is always more
complicated. It turns out that at least two different versions of
regular expressions exist: extended and basic. Moreover, not all
applications support all the possible rules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c48580.0x1d40870"></a>Basics of Regular Expressions</h2></div></div><p>A regular expression is said to <span   class="emphasis"><em>match</em></span> a
given string if it correctly describes it. A given regular
expression can match with zero to many strings. By convention,
regular expressions are written between slashes (/.../). In what
follows, I use extended regular expressions.</p><p>The simplest regular expression is a plain alphanumeric
string. Such a regexp matches with all strings containing its
content as a substring. As an example, consider the following verse
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cenerentola</em></span>, my favorite opera by G.
Rossini: &ldquo;Zitto, zitto, piano, piano, senza strepito e rumore.&rdquo;
The regexp /piano/ is said to match with the verse, because the
latter contains the same characters, with the same sequence, of the
regexp.</p><p>In order to better understand the examples I discuss, you can
play with the following Perl script, trying variations of the
regexp it contains:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
$verse = "Zitto, zitto, piano, piano, senza " .
         "strepito e rumore";
if ($verse =~ /piano/) {
   print "Match!\n";
} else {
   print "Do not match!\n";
}
</pre><p>In Perl, the operator =~ compares two regular expressions and
returns &ldquo;true&rdquo; if they match.
</p><p>A few characters (called metacharacters) are not recognized
as ordinary characters and are used for special purposes. The *,
for example, is used to match zero or more times a group of
characters that, in turn, is identified by a couple of parentheses
defining an atom, or a group of characters that must be considered
as a single entity. The regexp <b  >/( piano,)*/</b>
matches with the sample verse because the characters &ldquo;
<b  >piano,</b>&rdquo;, forming an atom, are repeated twice.
If the atom is composed of a single character, parentheses may be
omitted.</p><p>The meaning of the * within a regular expression is different
from the one it has in the shell. In regular expressions, the * is
a modifier; it describes the multiplicity of the atom on its left.
So, the string &ldquo;piano&rdquo; is matched by <b  >p*</b> in a
shell, but not within a regular expression: <b  >/p*/</b>
matches with p, pp, ppp and so on, and even with a null
string.</p><p>To specify that an atom's multiplicity ranges between N and
M, the symbol {N,M} is used. {N} matches strings with exactly N
repetitions of the preceding atom; {N,} will match at least N of
them. So, the following regular expressions will match:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/( piano,){0,10}/
/( piano,){1,2}/
/( piano,){2}/
</pre><p>Of course, the first regexp will match with &ldquo; piano, piano,
piano&rdquo; too.
</p><p>The metacharacters + and ? are shorthands, respectively, for
{1,} and {0,1}.</p><p>Matched parenthesized atoms are automatically stored into
special variables (called back references) identified by the symbol
\ followed by a number. The first parenthesized atom occurrence in
a regular expression will be stored in \1, the second in \2 and so
on. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Z(itto), z\1, ( piano,)\2/
</pre><p>will match the above-mentioned verse (imagine that \1 =
&ldquo;itto&rdquo; and \2 = &ldquo;piano,&rdquo;).
</p><p>The . metacharacter can describe any character, so the
regular expression <b  >/.(itto), .\1/</b> matches both
&ldquo;Zitto, zitto&rdquo; and &ldquo;zitto, zitto&rdquo;. However, it even matches
with &ldquo;Ritto, ritto&rdquo;, which does not have the same meaning. To
avoid being so generic, you can specify a set of possible
alternatives, listing the possible characters in brackets:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/[Zz](itto), [Zz]\1/
</pre><p>A dash in brackets is used to specify a range of characters.
For example, <b  >/[a-z]/</b> matches all lowercase
characters, and <b  >/[A-Z]/</b> matches all uppercase
characters. <b  >/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/</b> matches any
alphanumeric character or an undesrcore.
</p><p>The metacharacter | can be used to express different
alternatives. It works like a logical OR statement.
Therefore:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Zitto|zitto/
</pre><p>will match with both &ldquo;Zitto&rdquo; and &ldquo;zitto&rdquo;.
</p><p>The metacharacters ^ and $ match, respectively, the beginning
and the end of a string. If used inside brackets, the caret is
interpreted as the negation operator. So:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/[^a-z]itto/
</pre><p>will match Zitto, but not zitto (<b  >[^a-z]</b>
can be read as &ldquo;any letter that is not a lowercase letter&rdquo;).
</p><p>To match a metacharacter it's enough to put a backslash (\)
in front of it to tell the regexp to interpret it as an ordinary
character. The \ character is often called an escape
character.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c48580.0x1d41528"></a>Using Regular Expressions</h2></div></div><p>To appreciate the power of regular expressions, let's look at
a simple Perl script that helps system administrators look for
authentication failures. For the following examples I used rather
expressive regular expressions to show different features. You may
write simpler ones to describe the same strings.</p><p>Each time someone fails to log in, syslogd writes messages to
/var/log/messages that read like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Jul 26 16:35:25 myhost su(pam_unix)[2549]:
authentication failure; logname=verdi uid=500
euid=0
tty= ruser=organtin rhost=  user=root
Jul 27 14:54:36 myhost login(pam_unix)[688]:
authentication failure; logname=LOGIN uid=0
euid=0 tty=tty1 ruser= rhost=  user=mozart
</pre><p>These lines list the time at which the login attempt was
made, the user who tried to log in as another user, if available,
and the target user. For example, the user verdi tried to log in as
root two times, while someone failed to log in as mozart from the
console.
</p><p>Consider the Perl script shown in Listing 1. It reads the
/var/log/messages file, then identifies the lines that look
interesting and extracts only the relevant information.</p><p><a href="6324l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample Perl Script for
Finding Authentication Errors</a></p><p>First of all, we select only relevant lines and match them
with the regular expression /authentication failure/ shown on line
7. Everything else is discarded. Then each line is matched with a
regular expression (line 8) that should be read as follows: take
all the strings starting (^) with exactly three ({3}) alphabetic
([a-zA-Z]) characters, followed by a space, followed by at most two
(+) characters that could be either numeric (0-9, equivalent in
Perl to the metacharacter \d) or a space. After a space, an
arbitrary number (*) of digits or semicolons must follow. The
portion of the string described so far is enclosed in parentheses,
so it is stored in a back reference called \1 (it is the first
one). After that, any number of characters (.*) can be found before
the string &ldquo;logname=&rdquo;. That string must be followed by any number
of alphanumeric characters. Again, because there are a couple of
parentheses, we will store them in \2. Any number of characters,
finally, can be present before the string &ldquo;user=&rdquo;, followed by
any number of alphanumeric characters. This all gets stored into
\3.</p><p>From this example, you can see how it is possible to extract
substrings from strings. You do not need to know their relative
positions, as long as you can describe their appearance.</p><p>Perl provides a helpful feature for working with regexps. The
automagic definition of Perl variables named after the back
references as $1, $2 and so on, can be used after a regular
expression has been matched. Perl also lets users define useful
symbols, such as \d or \w (equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]), as well as
POSIX-compliant symbols representing the same things (see
<b  >man perlre</b> for more information).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c48580.0x1d419a0"></a>Basic Regular Expressions</h2></div></div><p>Basic regular expressions are used by several other programs,
like sed or egrep.</p><p>In basic regular expressions, the metacharacters |, + and ?
do not exist, and parentheses and braces need to be escaped to be
interpreted as metacharacters. The ^, $ and * metacharacters follow
more complicated rules (see <b  >man 7 regex</b> for more
details). In most cases, however, they behave like their extended
counterparts. It is often convenient to express the regular
expression in the extended format, then add the escape characters
when needed.</p><p>As an example, the script shown in Listing 2 generates an
HTML-formatted page to read the content of system log files using
an internet browser. Besides echoing HTML tags for the headers of
the page and for a table, it simply lists files in a given
directory and pipes the result to sed, which transforms it using a
regexp. The syntax used by sed for text substitution is rather
common and is something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
s/regexp/replacement/
</pre><p>where regexp is a regular expression that must be replaced.
</p><p><a href="6324l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Example Script for
Generating and HTML-Formatted Page for Reading Log
Files</a></p><p>Essentially, the syntax represents a string composed of nine
elements properly described by the appropriate regular expressions.
For example <b  >[rwxds-]</b> asks for the possible
characters that can be found within the first element.</p><p>The latter part of the string consists of alphanumeric
characters, with slashes interspersed. You may notice that the
regular expression used in this case is (.*\/)(.*). The first group
matches all characters preceding a (escaped) slash, i.e., the path
name. The second group lists all the following characters (the
filename). The number of slashes in the path doesn't matter.
Regular expressions (both basic and extended), in fact, are said to
be greedy&mdash;they try to match as many characters as possible.</p><p>The result of the script is written to standard output and
can be redirected to a given file (by cron at fixed intervals, for
example) to be shown on the Web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c48580.0x213a0c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Regular expressions are by far the most powerful tool for
text manipulation and description, and they are well supported
under Linux on many applications. Unfortunately, they are not
supported at all (to my knowledge) by the most popular search
engines because of their complexities. But, can you imagine how
precise your search would be if you had the ability to describe the
page you are looking for with a regular expression?</p></div></div>
