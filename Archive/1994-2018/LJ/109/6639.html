    Is Plone the killer app that will bring Zope-based content
    management to the masses?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x275f608"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the biggest reasons for the
success of the Apple II computer in the late 1970s was not a
product of Apple Computer, Inc. Rather, the first spreadsheet,
VisiCalc, written by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston, helped propel
sales of the Apple II. VisiCalc was a revolutionary product, and it
worked only on Apple computers. Businesses everywhere began to buy
Apple computers, simply so they could have VisiCalc.
</p><p>It turns out that Bricklin and Frankston hadn't invented only
the spreadsheet. They also had invented the killer app&mdash;an
application that makes a platform so compelling, people adopt the
platform for that one product. Every platform vendor hopes someone
will produce a killer app for its product, driving up sales of the
platform technology as more and more people want it for themselves.
Things are not much different in the Open Source world, although
different motivators exist. For example, many people have adopted
Linux in order to use Apache or Python to work with Zope.</p><p>The latest example of a killer app in the Open Source world
is Plone, a content management system (CMS) written on top of Zope
by Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan and Vidar Andersen. Plone has become
an increasingly prominent piece of software in recent months and
has brought many people into the Zope community. And although many
Plone users seem to stay within that world and don't venture into
the depths of the Zope server, Plone may well be the killer app for
Zope. If true, this would be a fascinating trend, given how Zope
has long been considered the killer app for the Python
language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x275f7c0"></a>What Is Plone?</h2></div></div><p>Plone is a simple CMS that allows a site administrator to
grant different privileges to different users. All users can read
publicly available content. Some users are allowed to enter new
content, and other users are allowed to publish that content to the
general public. Indeed, the distinction between
<span   class="emphasis"><em>available</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>published</em></span>
content is what most distinguishes a CMS from a run-of-the-mill web
site.</p><p>In contrast with a static web site, where files are available
to the public as soon as they exist in the root document directory,
a CMS allows you to expose content selectively. Moreover, a CMS
allows you to retract previously published content. So if your site
publishes a news story that turns out to be false, you can remove
it from the public's view without actually having to remove any
files. A log of when the story was written, published and
retracted, along with who performed each action and the reason why,
is available to site administrators at all times.</p><p>Plone is not designed to be the be-all and end-all of content
management systems. Rather, it is meant to be used on small- and
medium-sized web sites whose administrators want to provide a
variety of useful features, prefer a nice user interface and need
the ability to customize the site's look and feel to a certain
degree.</p><p>Plone itself is implemented as a number of different Zope
products, where each product is actually an object class that can
be instantiated multiple times. However, Plone is not implemented
directly in Zope but within Zope's content management framework
(CMF), a set of objects and APIs meant to make it easy to create
your own CMS.</p><p>Plone 1.0 was released prior to this writing, in early 2003,
and depends on CMF v1.3, which was released in mid-2002. Just as a
desktop application uses many of the facilities that the underlying
operating system provides, Plone, or any CMF-based CMS, uses the
capabilities that the CMF provides. Plone sites thus offer
full-text search and the ability for community members to comment
on any content object. As the CMF improves and offers more
services, I expect Plone also will improve.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x275fad8"></a>Installing Plone</h2></div></div><p>If you already are running Zope, installing Plone is quite
easy. Remember that every Zope product must be installed in the
lib/python/Products directory within your Zope directory. In
addition, Zope must be restarted either manually or from the
web-based control panel in order for newly installed products to be
seen and registered.</p><p>Before you can install Plone, you must install the latest
version of the CMF. Retrieve CMF-1.3 from
<a href="http://cmf.zope.org" target="_self">cmf.zope.org</a>, which comes
as a gzipped tar file. I put the tar file in /tmp and installed it
as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd $ZOPE/lib/python/Products
# tar -zxvf /tmp/CMF-1.3.tar.gz

</pre><p>The CMF-1.3 directory created in lib/python/Products contains
a number of CMF-related products that Zope needs to locate at
startup. We therefore create a number of symbolic links to the
product directories:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln CMF-1.3/CMFCore .
# ln CMF-1.3/CMFCalendar .
# ln CMF-1.3/CMFDefault .
# ln CMF-1.3/CMFTopic .
</pre>


Now that the CMF is installed, we can install Plone as well.
Retrieve a tar file of Plone from
<a href="http://www.plone.org" target="_self">www.plone.org</a>, place it
in /tmp and expand it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd $ZOPE/lib/python/Products
# tar -zxvf /tmp/CMFPlone-1.0.tar.gz
</pre>


As with the core CMF product, you must create several symbolic
links in the Products directory, so Zope can recognize them when it
starts up:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -s CMFPlone-1.0/CMFPlone .
# ln -s CMFPlone-1.0/DCWorkflow .
# ln -s CMFPlone-1.0/Formulator .
</pre>


If you are using a version of Zope prior to 2.6.x, you might need
to create a symbolic link from another product to the main Products
directory. Check the Plone instructions to be sure.
</p><p>Make sure the CMF-1.3 and CMFPlone directories and their
contents are owned by the same user as the one as which Zope runs.
This is normally a user named www or zope. Running Zope as nobody,
which used to be considered a safe option, is no longer
recommended. If the appropriate user does not own the files, you
could encounter some odd ownership and permission problems.</p><p>Now you have installed everything you need to create a site
managed by Plone. Start Zope, log in as a user with administrative
privileges and you're ready to go.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x275ff50"></a>Creating a Plone Site</h2></div></div><p>Creating a Plone site is extremely easy from within the
web-based Zope management interface. From the add product menu,
choose the Plone site. You will be prompted to enter several pieces
of information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the ID of the site, which will be part of the
URL;</p></li><li><p>the title of the site, which will appear at the top
of each page;</p></li><li><p>whether the site should have its own user folder or
should inherit users from the surrounding Zope site;</p></li><li><p>a description of the site; and</p></li><li><p>the type of site you're creating (for now, leave it
at the default Plone).</p></li></ul></div><p>When Zope finishes creating a new instance of the Plone site,
the large pane in the Zope management interface changes
dramatically. An introductory message appears in the middle, a
toolbar slides across the top, and information, including a
calendar, shows up in rectangles along the left and right
sides.</p><p>The interface for modifying a Plone site is significantly
different from the standard Zope interface. Whereas Zope normally
displays the same screens for all users and only presents the
management interface when the /manage method call is tacked onto a
URL, Plone modifies its output according to the current user's
permissions. So although guests can navigate only through the
site's content, administrators are shown tabs, such as view, edit,
properties and state, and can see all items on the site, including
those not yet published.</p><p>Luckily, the Plone user interface is fairly straightforward
for administrators. To modify the contents of a page, click on the
edit tab. You can then edit the content, including its URL and
summary information, using your web browser. The summary
information appears in search results. Plone uses JavaScript to
make the user interface easier to understand for nontechnical
users; for example, clicking on any HTML widget, such as a text
area or radio button, in the Plone editing interface brings up a
tooltip-like description of what should be inserted.</p><p>Content added or modified using the web-based Plone interface
can be in plain text, in HTML or in Zope's structured text format,
which uses punctuation and indentation as formatting mechanisms. I
prefer to use structured text as often as possible, using HTML only
when I want to format a page in a way that structured text doesn't
allow.</p><p>Surrounding the main document on a page are multiple
portlets, accessories that add to a site's content. Plone comes
with several portlets by default, including a list of news stories,
a list of events, a calendar that displays today's date and
highlights any events during the current month and a list of
relevant documents on the current site.</p><p>To add a new document, first move to the contents view by
clicking on that link in the navigation portlet. This produces a
list of documents in the current folder. You then can select a new
content type from the add new item in the upper-left corner. It's
important to realize a new document is created as soon as you click
on add new document; following that, you are modifying its
properties and content.</p><p>By default, Plone allows you to create a number of different
content types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Folders allow you to structure your site with a
hierarchy. Just as a disk, static web site or Zope site contains
files in folders, Plone sites can contain folders. The title of
each published folder is displayed in the navigation
portlet.</p></li><li><p>Documents are the most common item on Plone sites
and can be formatted in HTML, structured text or plain text. Most
of the time, you probably will want to create a new
document.</p></li><li><p>Images can be in nearly any format, including JPEG,
PNG and GIF.</p></li><li><p>Files are items you want users to be able to view
or download but that don't have a MIME content type that Plone can
work with easily. Some examples are QuickTime movies, audio clips
and Microsoft Office documents.</p></li><li><p>Events are short documents with a starting and
ending date and are highlighted in the calendar portlet.</p></li><li><p>News items are short documents displayed in the
news portlet. This is a good and easy way to publish press
releases, for example.</p></li></ul></div><p>Plone also comes with links, which are URLs of interest to
the outside world, and topics, which are predefined searches within
the site. An increasing number of other content types are emerging
for Plone, such as a weblog and a photo album.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x2760b58"></a>Publishing Documents</h2></div></div><p>When you create a new piece of content in Plone, it is in the
visible state by default. This means that if people know the URL,
they can get to your document with their web browsers. The content
does not appear, however, in searches or in the navigation
portlet.</p><p>To publish content, click on the state tab at the top of the
page. (From the contents view, you can publish multiple pieces of
content simultaneously with the state button at the bottom of the
page.) This brings you to a page that asks when the content should
first be published, when it should expire and any comments you wish
to make about the decision to publish the document. The dates you
enter are the final arbiter, meaning that a published document will
be visible only between its starting and ending dates. This allows
you to enter content days or weeks before it should be exposed to
the general public, without having to change its state to published
at the appropriate time.</p><p>Once published, a document appears in full-text searches. It
also is visible within any folder that lacks a default index_html
document.</p><p>One of my favorite Plone features is properties. Each
document can be assigned one or more properties by the properties
management tab at the top of the screen. When a user views the
content, the related portlet lists all of the other documents on
the site that share one or more properties with the current one.
This allows site visitors to find easily other content that might
interest them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2667580.0x27575f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Zope is a powerful application server, and the CMF is a
powerful toolkit for creating a CMS. But, given the steep learning
curve associated with both of them, it is possible that Plone may
be the killer app for Zope, bringing new people into the world of
Zope through great functionality that is easy to install, configure
and manage.</p><p>Next month, we will take a closer look at Plone, examining
ways we can modify what is displayed, including changing the site's
look and feel.</p><p><a href="6639s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
