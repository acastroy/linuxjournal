that enables the execution of ordinary user-space programs inside
kernel space. This article presents the background, an approach and
an implementation of KML. A brief performance experiment also is
presented.
</p><p>Traditional kernels protect themselves by using the hardware
facilities of CPUs. For example, the Linux kernel protects itself
by using a CPU's privilege-level facility and memory protection
facility. The kernel assigns itself the most-privileged level,
kernel mode. User processes are at the least-privileged level, user
mode. Thus, the kernel is protected by CPUs, because programs
executed in user mode cannot access memory that belongs to programs
executed in kernel mode.</p><p>This protection-by-hardware approach, however, has a problem:
user processes cannot access the kernel completely. That is, the
kernel cannot provide any useful services, such as filesystems,
network communication and process management, to user processes. In
short, user processes cannot invoke system calls in the
kernel.</p><p>To cope with this problem, traditional kernels exploit
hardware facilities that modern CPUs provide for, escalating a
program's privilege level in a safe and restricted way. For
example, the Linux kernel for the IA-32 platform uses a software
interrupt mechanism inherent to IA-32. The software interrupt can
be seen as a special jump instruction whose target address is
restricted by the kernel. At initialization, the kernel sets the
target address of the software interrupt to the address of a
special routine that handles system calls. To invoke system calls,
a user program executes a special instruction, int 0x80. Then, the
system-call handling routine in the kernel is executed in kernel
mode. The routine performs a context switch; that is, it saves the
content of the registers of the user program. Finally, it calls the
kernel function that implements the system service specified by the
user program.</p><p>The system call-by-hardware approach can become very slow,
however, because the software interrupt and the context switch
require heavy and complex operations. On the recent Pentium 4, the
software interrupt and context switch is about 132 times slower
than a mere function call.</p><p>By the way, recent Linux kernels for IA-32, versions 2.5.53
and later, use a pair of special instructions, sysenter and
sysexit, for system calls. But, this is still about 36 times slower
than a mere function call.</p><p>The obvious way to accelerate system calls is to execute user
processes in kernel mode. Then, system calls are handled quickly
because no software interrupts and context switches are needed.
They can be function calls only, because the user processes can
access the kernel directly. This approach may seem to have a
security problem, because the user processes executed in kernel
mode can access arbitrary portions of the kernel. Recent advances
in static program analysis, such as type theory, can be used to
protect the kernel from user processes. Many technologies enable
this protection-by-software approach, including Java bytecode, .NET
CIL, O'Caml, Typed Assembly Language and Proof-Carrying
Code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a3fb30"></a>KML: Execute User Processes in Kernel
Mode</h2></div></div><p>As a first step toward a kernel protected by software, I have
implemented KML. KML is a modified Linux kernel that executes user
processes in kernel mode, which then are called kernel-mode user
processes. Kernel-mode user processes can interact with the kernel
directly. Therefore, the overhead of system calls can be
eliminated.</p><p>KML is provided as a patch to the source of the original
Linux kernel, so you need to build the kernel from the source. To
use KML, apply the patch and enable Kernel Mode Linux when you
configure your kernel. Build and install the kernel, and then
reboot. The KML patch is available from
<a href="http://www.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tosh/kml" target="_self">www.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tosh/kml</a>.</p><p>In current KML, programs under the directory /trusted are run
as kernel-mode user processes. The kernel itself doesn't perform
any safety check. For example, the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cp /bin/bash /trusted/bin &amp;&amp; /trusted/bin/bash
</pre><p>execute bash in kernel mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a3fdf0"></a>What Kernel-Mode User Processes Can Do</h2></div></div><p>Kernel-mode user processes are ordinary user processes
except, of course, for their privilege level. Therefore, they
basically can do whatever an ordinary user process can do. For
example, a kernel-mode user process can invoke all system calls,
even fork, clone and mmap. In addition, if you use a recent GNU C
library (2.3.2 and later or the development version from CVS),
system calls are translated automatically to function calls in
kernel-mode user processes, with a few exceptions, such as clone.
Therefore, the overhead of system calls in your program is removed
without modifying it.</p><p>The paging mechanism also works. That is, kernel-mode user
processes each have their own address space, the same as ordinary
user processes. Moreover, even if the kernel-mode user process
excessively allocates huge memory, the kernel automatically pages
out the memory, as it does for ordinary user processes.</p><p>Exceptions, such as segmentation faults and illegal
instruction exceptions, can be handled the same as an ordinary user
process, unless the program improperly accesses the memory of the
kernel or improperly executes privileged instructions. As an
example, build the following program and execute it as a
kernel-mode process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    *(int*)0 = 1;
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>The process is terminated by a segmentation fault exception,
without a kernel panic. This example also indicates that the signal
mechanism works.
</p><p>As a second example, build the following program and execute
it as a kernel-mode user process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    for (;;);
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>Then, use Ctrl-C to send SIGINT to the process. Notice that
it receives the signal and exits normally.
</p><p>This second example also indicates that process scheduling
works. That is, even if a kernel-mode user process enters an
infinite loop, the kernel preempts the process and executes other
processes. You may have noticed already that your system did not
hang, even in the infinite loop of this example.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a401b8"></a>What Kernel-Mode User Processes Cannot
Do</h2></div></div><p>Although kernel-mode user processes are ordinary user
processes, they have a few limitations. If a kernel-mode user
process violates these limitations, the system will be in an
undefined state. In the worst-case scenario, your system may be
broken.</p><p>Limitation 1: don't modify the CS, DS, SS or FS segment
register. Current KML for IA-32 assumes that these segment
registers are not modified by kernel-mode user processes, and it
uses them internally.</p><p>Limitation 2: don't perform privileged actions improperly. In
kernel mode, programs can perform any privileged action. However,
if your program performs such actions in a way that is inconsistent
with the kernel, the system will be in an undefined state. For
example, if you execute the following program as a kernel-mode user
process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
        /* disable hardware interrupts */
        __asm__ __volatile__ ("cli");
        for (;;);
        return 0;
}
</pre><p>your system will hang.
</p><p>In my experience, few applications violate these limitations.
Ones that do violate them include WINE and VMware. These
limitations are against only kernel-mode user processes. Ordinary
user processes are never affected by these limitations, even when
running on a KML-capable kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a40478"></a>KML Internals</h2></div></div><p>In IA-32 CPUs, the privilege level of an executed program is
determined by the privilege level of the code segment in which the
program is executed. Recall that a program counter for IA-32 CPUs
consists of a segment, specified by the CS segment register, and an
offset into the segment, the EIP register. The privilege level of
the code segment then is determined by its segment descriptor. A
segment descriptor has a field for specifying the privilege level
of the segment.</p><p>Basically, the Linux kernel prepares two segments, the kernel
code segment and the user code segment. The kernel code segment is
used for the kernel itself, and its privilege level is kernel mode.
The user code segment is used for ordinary user processes, and its
privilege level is user mode. When using execve on a user process,
the original Linux kernel sets its CS segment register to the user
code segment. Thus, the user process is executed in user
mode.</p><p>To execute a user process as a kernel-mode user process, the
only thing KML does is set the CS register of the process to the
kernel code segment, instead of to the user code segment. Then the
process is executed in kernel mode. Because of KML's simple
approach, a kernel-mode user process can be an ordinary user
process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a40630"></a>The Stack Starvation Problem and Its
Solution</h2></div></div><p>As described in the previous section, the basic approach of
KML is quite simple. Its big problem is called stack starvation.
First, I'll explain how the original Linux kernel handles
exceptions (page faults) and interrupts (timer interrupts) on IA-32
CPUs. Then, I'll describe the stack starvation problem. Finally,
I'll present my solution to the problem.</p><p>In the original Linux kernel, interrupts are handled by
interrupt handling routines specified as gates in the Interrupt
Descriptor Table (IDT). When an interrupt occurs, an IA-32 CPU
stops execution of the running program, saves the execution context
of the program and executes the interrupt handling routine.</p><p>How the IA-32 CPU saves the execution context of a running
program at interrupts depends on the privilege level of the
program. If the program is executed in user mode, the IA-32 CPU
automatically switches its memory stack to a kernel stack. Then, it
saves the execution context (EIP, CS, EFLAGS, ESP and SS register)
to the kernel stack. On the other hand, if the program is executed
in kernel mode, the IA-32 CPU doesn't switch its memory stack and
saves the context (EIP, CS and EFLAGS register) to the memory stack
of the running program.</p><p>What happens if a kernel-mode user process of KML accesses
its memory stack, which is not mapped by the page tables of a CPU?
First, a page fault occurs, and the CPU tries to interrupt the
process and jump to a page fault handler specified in the IDT.
However, the CPU can't accomplish this work, because there is no
stack for saving the execution context. Because the process is
executed in kernel mode, the CPU can never switch the memory stack
to the kernel stack. To signal this fatal situation, the CPU tries
to generate a special exception, a double fault. Again, the CPU
can't generate the double fault, because there is no stack for
saving the execution context of the running process. Finally, the
CPU gives up and resets itself.</p><p>To solve this stack starvation problem, KML exploits the task
management facility of IA-32 CPUs. The IA-32 task management
facility is provided to support process management for kernels.
Using the facility, a kernel can switch between processes with only
one instruction. However, today's kernels don't use this facility,
because it is slower than software-only approaches. Thus, the
facility is almost forgotten by all.</p><p>The strength of this task management facility in IA-32 CPUs
is that it can be used to handle interrupts and exceptions. Tasks
managed by an IA-32 CPU can be set to the IDT. If an interrupt
occurs and a task is assigned to handle the interrupt, the CPU
first saves the execution context of the interrupted program to a
task data structure of the program instead of to the memory stacks.
Then, the CPU restores the context from the task data structure
specified in the IDT.</p><p>The most important point is there is no need to switch a
memory stack if the task management facility is used to handle
interrupts. That is, if we handle page fault exceptions with the
facility, a kernel-mode user process can access its memory stack
safely.</p><p>However, if we handle all page faults with the facility, the
performance of the whole system degrades, because the task-based
interrupt handling is slower than the ordinary interrupt
handling.</p><p>Therefore, we handle only double fault exceptions this way.
So, only page faults caused by memory stack absence are handled by
the task management facility. In my experience, memory stacks
rarely cause page faults, and the performance decrement is
negligible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1947580.0x1a409f8"></a>Performance Measurement</h2></div></div><p>To measure the degree of performance improvement, I conducted
two experiments. Both experiments compared performance of the
original Linux kernel and KML. I used the sysenter/sysexit
mechanism for performance measurement of the original Linux kernel,
instead of the int 0x80 instruction. The experimental environment
is shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="6516t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Experimental
Environment</a></p><p>In the first experiment, I measured the latency of the getpid
and gettimeofday system calls. In the measurement, the system calls
were invoked directly by user programs, without libc. The latency
was measured with the rdtsc instruction. The result is shown in
Table 2.</p><p><a href="6516t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Latency of System Calls
(Unit: CPU Cycles)</a></p><p>The result shows that getpid was 36 times faster in KML than
in the original Linux kernel, and gettimeofday was twice as fast in
KML as it was in the original Linux kernel.</p><p>The second experiment is a file I/O benchmark using the
Iozone filesystem benchmark. I measured the throughput of four
types of file I/O: write, rewrite, read and reread. The
measurements were performed on various file sizes from 16KB to
256KB, and the buffer size was fixed at 8KB. The underlying
filesystem was ext3. In each measurement, I executed the Iozone
benchmark 30 times and chose the best throughput.</p><p>The throughput of reread is shown in Table 3. Due to space
limitations, the detailed results for write, rewrite and read are
omitted.</p><p><a href="6516t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Throughput of reread:
Buffer Size=8KB</a></p><p>The result shows that the throughput of reread in KML was
improved by 6.8-21%. In addition, write was improved by 0.6-3.2%,
rewrite was improved by 3.3-5.3% and read was improved by
3.1-15%.</p><p>These experimental results indicate that KML can improve the
performance of applications that invoke system calls often, such as
those that read or write many small files. For example, web servers
and databases can be executed efficiently in KML.</p><p>I've performed a benchmark for the Apache HTTP server on KML.
It didn't show performance improvement, because I have only a
100-base Ethernet LAN, which became the main bottleneck. If I
perform the benchmark on a faster network (say, 1000-base Ethernet
or faster), I predict it will show performance improvement.</p><p>In the preceeding experiments, it is worth noting that KML
eliminated only the overhead of system calls. With some
modification to the application, KML will be able to do more for
performance improvement. For example, kernel-mode user processes
can access I/O buffers directly in the kernel to improve I/O
performance.</p><p><a href="6516s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
