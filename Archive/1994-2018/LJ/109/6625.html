    Use one easy GUI application to build and deploy policies
    for all your firewalls and servers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c1558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux 2.4's Netfilter firewall code and
its front end, iptables, deserve the praise and popularity they've
garnered. They've brought Linux firewalls to the same level as
commercial stateful packet-filtering firewalls, from the
standpoints of functionality, intelligence and security.
</p><p>Only one thing has been lacking from the Netfilter
experience: user-friendliness. A good firewall GUI isn't merely a
crutch to be used by nontechnical people. Even the most
pointy-headed of us tend to work faster and make fewer mistakes in
our firewall policies if we can construct rules with the aid of
visual cues and reminders. There's little value in focusing on
iptables' command syntax at the expense of the actual security
policy your firewall needs to enforce.</p><p>Firewall Builder (Figure 1) is a good firewall GUI indeed. It
lets you define host, network and service objects that can be used
and reused in as many different firewall rulesets as you like; it
displays your rules in an instinctive and clear way; and because
it's intentionally OS-agnostic, you can use Firewall Builder to
generate rulesets not only for Netfilter/iptables, but also for
FreeBSD's ipfilter, OpenBSD's pf and even Cisco PIX
firewalls.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f1.large.jpg"><img src="6625f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Firewall Builder in
Action</p></div></div>
</p><p>This issue and next I'll show you how to obtain and install
Firewall Builder, and then I'll explain how to use it to build
iptables policies of your own easily and instinctively. To begin,
we focus on installing Firewall Builder and on populating its
Objects database; next month we'll cover policy construction
in-depth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c1978"></a>Where to Install Firewall Builder</h2></div></div><p>First, a few words on where to install and run Firewall
Builder. I don't think it's a good idea to run Firewall Builder on
an actual firewall or on any other hardened, publicly accessible
host, called a bastion host. In short, I don't think you should run
the X Window System on such hosts.</p><p>Instead, you should run Firewall Builder on your normal
day-to-day workstation. Then, copy the firewall scripts you build
to the host you actually wish to configure, using scp or some other
secure means. Firewall Builder is designed to be used in this
way.</p><p>On the other hand, if you intend to use Firewall Builder to
create Netfilter scripts for local protection of one particular
host, such as a Linux 2.4-based web server, perhaps it's okay to
run Firewall Builder directly on the host on which its scripts will
be installed. But, make sure X11 is installed on the host and the
host itself is behind a proper firewall.</p><p>The important point is you don't need to run Firewall Builder
on each host you want configured. Therefore, you shouldn't run it
on any host on which you wouldn't otherwise run the X Window
System. A single host running Firewall Builder can generate scripts
for as many different hosts as you like. We'll see how this is
possible shortly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c1b88"></a>Getting and Installing Firewall Builder</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, the Firewall Builder Project has its own home
page, where you can obtain the latest software releases and
documents:
<a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org" target="_self">www.fwbuilder.org</a>. If
anything I say here is different from something you read there, I
defer to that site. Firewall Builder's on-line installation
instructions are clear and accurate, and they may change between
the time I wrote this article and the time it actually is
printed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c1ce8"></a>Debian</h2></div></div><p>I'll start with the easiest case. If you run Debian 3.0, you
can install Firewall Builder directly from your Debian installation
source; Debian has its own officially supported deb package, called
fwbuilder. Among other things, this package depends on the Debian
packages libfwbuilder0, fwbuilder-iptables, libgtk1.2, libgtkmm1.2,
libxslt1, libxml2 and libsnmp4.2.</p><p>I'll skip the complete list of dependencies, though. If you
use apt-get to install fwbuilder, apt-get will identify and install
all required packages for you. I also recommend installing Debian's
fwbuilder-doc package; it is optional (and therefore won't be
installed automatically by apt-get in order to satisfy any
dependencies) but contains comprehensive and useful
documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c1e48"></a>Red Hat</h2></div></div><p>As of Red Hat 8.0 (the latest Red Hat release at the time of
this writing), Firewall Builder isn't yet an official part of Red
Hat Linux. However, the Firewall Builder team provides RPM files
for several Red Hat releases; see the Firewall Builder download
site at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314</a>.</p><p>You'll need the fwbuilder and libfwbuilder packages, plus at
least one of fwbuilder-ipt, fwbuilder-ipf or fwbuilder-pf,
depending on whether you create rulesets for Linux
Netfilter/iptables, FreeBSD ipfilter or OpenBSD pf, respectively.
You can install more than one of these last three if you wish.
Because Firewall Builder's ultimate output is an ASCII script,
using a Linux system to generate firewall rules for other platforms
is not a problem.</p><p>Before installing the Firewall Builder packages, the
following standard Red Hat packages must be present: bind-utils,
gdk-pixbuf, glib, glibc, gtk+, gtkmm, libfwbuilder, libsigc++,
libstdc++, libxml2, libxslt, openssl-0.9.6b, ucd-snmp and
XFree86-libs.</p><p>In addition, you'll need gtkmm (the GIMP Tool Kit Minus
Minus), which contains the C++ bindings for GTK+. This package is
part of Ximian GNOME, but you also can download it from
<a href="http://www.freshrpms.net" target="_self">www.freshrpms.net</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c2108"></a>SuSE</h2></div></div><p>Like Red Hat, SuSE has not yet incorporated Firewall Builder
into its official release. SuSE 8.1 RPMs (albeit unofficial
contributed ones) are available from the Firewall Builder download
page
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314</a>).</p><p>You'll need the fwbuilder and libfwbuilder packages, plus one
or more of fwbuilder-ipt, fwbuilder-ipf or fwbuilder-pf. You'll
also need to have installed these standard SuSE packages: gcc,
gdk_pixbuf, glib, glibc-2.2.4, gtk, gtkmm, libsigc++, libstdc++,
libxml2, libxslt, libz, openssl-0.9.6b, ucdsnmp and xshared.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c22c0"></a>Creating Objects</h2></div></div><p>Once its packages are installed, you're ready to run Firewall
Builder. There's only one command to remember:
<b  >fwbuilder</b>. You must have the X Window System
running to run this command. You don't need to be root, though; in
fact, I recommend against it, because you always should avoid
needlessly doing things as root.</p><p>Once the fwbuilder window is up, you can start defining
objects (Figure 2). The whole point of Firewall Builder is to be
able to write rules using reusable, drag-and-drop objects, so
obviously, objects must exist before rules may be written. Even
Firewall Builder's automatic-policy-generating druids require that
objects already exist.</p><p>You can use objects to represent hosts, networks (identified
by IP address and subnet mask), address ranges, TCP/IP services,
firewalls (both multi-homed firewalls proper and bastion hosts),
time-ranges and groups of other objects. You may define as many or
as few objects as you think you'll use in your rulesets. At a
minimum, you'll need a firewall object and at least one network or
host object. Predefined service objects are provided for many
popular TCP/IP services.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c24d0"></a>Host Objects</h2></div></div><p>Objects are created from the dialogs in Firewall Builder's
Insert menu. Figure 2 shows the Insert host dialog for creating a
host object. A host object's defining characteristic for
rule-creating purposes is its IP address. If you wish to write
rules that match hosts by MAC/Ethernet address, you can define that
too. As you can see, you may enter the IP address manually or by
DNS lookup. The latter feature is handy, but it works only for
hosts whose names are resolvable by the system on which Firewall
Builder is running.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f2.large.jpg"><img src="6625f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Insert Host Dialog</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c27e8"></a>Network Objects</h2></div></div><p>Figure 3 shows the Insert network dialog. Unlike Insert host,
which pops up a separate window, Insert network simply opens a
blank New object form in the right-hand portion of the main window.
This dialog actually is simpler than the Insert host dialog; all
you need to enter are the network's IP address and subnet mask, a
name for the network object and, optionally, a comment.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f3.large.jpg"><img src="6625f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Insert Network Dialog</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18c2b00"></a>Firewall Objects</h2></div></div><p>The most complicated object by far is the firewall object.
Initial setup isn't too hairy in itself; simply define the
firewall's interface or interfaces by IP address and subnet mask.
But once the firewall object has been added, and it appears in the
list of user-defined objects on the left-hand side of the main
fwbuilder window, click on its icon. Five pages (tabs) of
information should appear on the right-hand side of the window
(Figure 4).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f4.large.jpg"><img src="6625f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Firewall Properties</p></div></div>
</p><p>On the General screen, we see the hostname entered in when
the firewall object was created. It's important, though, to select
appropriate Host OS and Platform options, so Firewall Builder will
know which of its compiler engines to use when converting policies
to firewall scripts for this firewall.</p><p>The SysInfo screen applies only to SNMP data (see Sidebar).
The Compile/Install screen is where you can set up automatic
installation of your firewall policies. If you intend to install
them manually, you can leave this screen alone. Someday, hopefully
soon, Firewall Builder will support the automatic transfer and
installation of firewall scripts using SSL. As of this writing,
however, the fwbd d&aelig;mon that must run on a target firewall
for this method to work has not been released.</p><p>If you leave the Compile/Install screen's Installer option at
its default of fwbd, even though this feature isn't yet supported,
nothing bad will happen; compiled firewall rules still are saved to
your home directory. The Install option in the Rules menu will be
grayed out, though. If, on the other hand, you set Installer to
Install Script, you then can specify the path to a custom script in
the Policy Install Script field, with optional command-line
parameters below. The custom script will be executed when you
select Rules&reg;Install after compiling a policy.</p><p>This method is a handy way to script, for example, an scp
command that securely copies your policies to their target
firewalls. Sample installation scripts, notably fwb_install, are
available under contrib at the Firewall Builder download site
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314</a>).</p><p>Regardless of what you set Installer to, Firewall Builder
writes the script it compiles for this firewall to a local ASCII
file with the same name as the firewall object and a suffix of .fw.
For example, scripts generated for the firewall Trillian in Figure
4 are named trillian.fw.</p><p>Continuing with Firewall's object properties, the Firewall
tab is used to configure options specific to the platform you
selected in the General screen, in our case
Netfilter/iptables-specific options (Figure 5). The defaults here
work fine for many if not most users, but a couple of the options
are worth discussing.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f5.large.jpg"><img src="6625f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Platform-Specific Firewall
Properties</p></div></div>
</p><p>In the Global Logging Parameters section you can control how
Firewall Builder writes log entries. The default Log Level of 6:
Info is okay. Personally, I log only dropped and rejected packets,
so I like to bump this up to 4: Warning.</p><p>In the Options section of the Firewall screen you may wish to
select Assume firewall object is part of Any. The default is for
the built-in Source/Destination object Any to be interpreted as
&ldquo;Any host except the firewall&rdquo;. This is not atypical in firewall
policy builders, but it can cause some surprising behaviors.</p><p>For example, if the last rule in your policy is a cleanup
rule that sets source=any, destination=any, service=any,
action=drop and logging=on, you'd expect any attempted connections
to the firewall not matching previous rules to be logged and
dropped, right? Indeed, they will be dropped, but not because of
this rule. They'll be dropped by the INPUT chain's default policy,
which Firewall Builder always sets to DROP. This example cleanup
rule is triggered only by attempted connections
<span   class="emphasis"><em>through</em></span> the firewall. As the firewall itself
is not assumed to be part of Any, your cleanup rule is implemented
only in the FORWARD chain, not in the INPUT or OUTPUT
chains.</p><p>Selecting Assume firewall object as part of Any reverses this
behavior, and it causes such a cleanup rule to behave the way you'd
expect. However, it may complicate other things, such as
anti-spoofing rules specific to firewall interfaces. In short, it's
a trade-off. My own preference is to leave this option deselected.
Then, I either tweak my Firewall Builder scripts to include the log
and drop lines to at least the INPUT chain, or I add an extra
Firewall input log and drop rule to my policy.</p><p>If in doubt, test and tinker with this setting. You can use
the Log all dropped packets in the Global Logging Parameters
section, but it requires your firewall to have had Netfilter
compiled with the Patch-O-Matic Dropped Table patch. This may not
be the case if you installed a kernel provided with your Linux
distribution.</p><p>The last screen of Firewall object properties is Network.
This contains settings specific to the Host OS you specified in the
General screen. These options directly alter your kernel's
behavior; if that frightens you, ignore this screen. But if your
firewall is a full-blown, entire-network-protecting firewall rather
than simply a hardened host, make sure you set Packet Forwarding to
On.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18b9d88"></a>Loopback Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>Believe it or not, even after all this work we're not done
configuring the firewall object. In Figure 4 you may have noticed
that in the hierarchical view of objects on the left-hand side of
the window, the firewall Trillian has two interfaces, eth0 and lo.
The eth0 subsection was created automatically when I ran the Insert
firewall dialog. lo, which represents Trillian's loopback
interface, had to be created manually. It's a little odd that its
creation doesn't happen automatically. Every firewall, whether a
multihomed host or a bastion host, needs rules that allow its
loopback interfaces free rein (so local processes aren't
interrupted).</p><p>To add a loopback interface manually, select your firewall
object's icon in the object list, pull down the Insert menu above
and select Interface. The Interface option is grayed-out unless
you've selected a Host or Firewall object. A new interface icon
appears below your firewall object, and the new interface's
properties are displayed on the right. Enter the interface's name
into Name (for example, lo), and deselect This Interface is
External (insecure). The latter option should be checked only for
your external interface and DMZ interface objects.</p><p>Next, while the new interface's object is still selected,
pull down the Insert menu again and select Address. Now an address
sub-object appears below your new interface, and its properties are
displayed on the right (Figure 6). Enter a name, an IP address of
127.0.0.1 and a netmask of 255.0.0.0 (the latter will be filled in
automatically, actually). In some circumstances, systems have more
than one loopback interface, in which case the address may vary
(127.0.0.2, etc.). Chances are, though, you have only one and its
IP is 127.0.0.1. When in doubt, do an <b  >ifconfig
-a</b> on your firewall.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6625f6.large.jpg"><img src="6625f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Adding a Loopback Interface's
Address</p></div></div>
</p><p>Once you've defined all your objects, or at least enough to
start writing rules, save them by pulling down the File menu and
selecting Save. You'll be prompted to provide a filename with a
suffix of .xml in your home directory. Some scripts expect objects
to be named objects.xml and to be stored in ~, but this is
user-configurable. In other words, name your objects file whatever
you like and put it wherever you want. Remember what and where
these are if you need to tweak fwb_install or another policy
installation script.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c9580.0x18ba200"></a>Next Steps, Next Month</h2></div></div><p>I'll leave it to you to create additional Host, Network and
Firewall objects pertinent to your environment. Also, I've skipped
Network Range and Time objects, both of which are easy to
understand and use&mdash;you can figure these out by playing with them
or by referring to the documentation at
<a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org" target="_self">www.fwbuilder.org</a>.
Next month, we'll use all these objects to build some policies. In
the meantime, I hope you've learned enough to get started and to
start exploring Firewall Builder on your own. Have fun!</p><p><a href="6625s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
