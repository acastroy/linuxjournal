    Call some useful fuctions of the GNU C library to save
    precious memory and to find nasty bugs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x2339608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Dealing with dynamic memory traditionally
has been one of the most awkward issues of C and C++ programming.
It is not surprising that some supposedly easier languages, such as
Java, have introduced garbage collection mechanisms that relieve
programmers of this burden. But for hard-core C programmers, the
GNU C library contains some tools that allow them to tune, check
and track the usage of memory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x2339710"></a>Memory Management Basics</h2></div></div><p>A process' memory usually is classified as either static, the
size is predetermined at compile time, or dynamic, space is
allocated as needed at runtime. The latter, in turn, is divided
into heap space, where malloc()'d memory comes from, and stack,
where functions' temporary work space is placed. As Figure 1 shows,
heap space grows upward, whereas stack space grows downward.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6390f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The heap and stack grow toward each
other.</p></div></div>
</p><p>When a process needs memory, some room is created by moving
the upper bound of the heap forward, using the brk() or sbrk()
system calls. Because a system call is expensive in terms of CPU
usage, a better strategy is to call brk() to grab a large chunk of
memory and then split it as needed to get smaller chunks. This is
exactly what malloc() does. It aggregates a lot of smaller malloc()
requests into fewer large brk() calls. Doing so yields a
significant performance improvement. The malloc() call itself is
much less expensive than brk(), because it is a library call, not a
system call. Symmetric behavior is adopted when memory is freed by
the process. Memory blocks are not immediately returned to the
system, which would require a new brk() call with a negative
argument. Instead, the C library aggregates them until a
sufficiently large, contiguous chunk can be freed at once.</p><p>For very large requests, malloc() uses the mmap() system call
to find addressable memory space. This process helps reduce the
negative effects of memory fragmentation when large blocks of
memory are freed but locked by smaller, more recently allocated
blocks lying between them and the end of the allocated space. In
this case, in fact, had the block been allocated with brk(), it
would have remained unusable by the system even if the process
freed it.</p><p>Library functions that deal with dynamic memory are not
limited to malloc() and free(), although these are by far the
most-used calls. Other available functions include realloc(), to
resize an already allocated block; calloc(), to allocate a cleared
block; and memalign(), posix_memalign() and valloc(), to allocate
an aligned block.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x2339b30"></a>Dealing with Memory Status</h2></div></div><p>The strategy adopted by the C library memory management code
is optimized for generic memory usage profiles. Although this
strategy produces good performance in most cases, some programs
might benefit from slightly different parameter tuning. First,
check your memory usage statistics by using either the
malloc_stats() or the mallinfo() library calls. The former prints
as a standard error a brief summary of memory usage in the program.
This summary includes how many bytes have been allocated from the
system, gathered with brk(); how many are actually in use, found
with malloc(); and how much memory has been claimed, using mmap().
Here is a sample output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Arena 0:
system bytes     =     205892
in use bytes     =     101188
Total (incl. mmap):
system bytes     =     205892
in use bytes     =     101188
max mmap regions =          0
max mmap bytes   =          0
</pre><p>If you need to have more precise information and want to make
more than a printout, mallinfo() is helpful. This function returns
a struct mallinfo containing various memory-related status
indicators; the most interesting are summarized in the Sidebar
&ldquo;Useful Parameters Provided by mallinfo&rdquo;. For a complete
description of the structure, take a look at /usr/include/malloc.h.
</p><p><a href="6390s1.html" target="_self">Useful Parameters Provided by
mallinfo()</a></p><p>Another useful function provided by libc is
malloc_usable_size(), which returns the number of bytes you
actually can use in a previously allocated memory block. This value
may be more than the amount you originally requested, due to
alignment and minimum size constraints. For example, if you
allocate 30 bytes, the usable size is actually 36. This means you
could write up to 36 bytes to that memory block without overwriting
other blocks. This is an extremely awful and version-dependent
programming practice, however, so please don't do it. The most
useful application of malloc_usable_size() probably is as a debug
tool. For example, it can check the size of a memory block passed
from outside before writing to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x2339df0"></a>Controlling the Allocation Strategy</h2></div></div><p>You can alter the behavior of the memory management functions
by adjusting some of the parameters exposed by the mallopt()
function (Listings 1 and 2).</p><p><a href="6390l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Setting the Trim
Threshold with mallopt()</a></p><p><a href="6390l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A smaller trim threshold
might save space.</a></p><p>The prototype of this function and a basic set of four
parameters are part of the SVID/XPG/ANSI standard. The current GNU
C library implementation (version 2.3.1 as of this writing) honors
only one of them (M_MXFAST), leaving three out. On the other hand,
the library provides four additional parameters not specified by
the standard. Tunable parameters accepted by mallopt() are
described in the Sidebar &ldquo;Tunable Parameters for
mallopt()&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="6390s3.html" target="_self">Tunable Paramenter for
mallopt()</a></p><p>Allocation tuning is possible even without introducing
mallopt() calls inside your program and recompiling it. This may be
useful if you want to test values quickly or if you don't have the
sources. All you have to do is set the appropriate environment
variable before running the application. Table 1 shows the mapping
between mallopt() parameters and environment variables, as well as
some additional information. If you wish to set the trim threshold
to 64KB, for example, you can run this program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD=65536 my_prog
</pre><p>Speaking of trimming, it is possible to trim the memory arena
and give any unused memory back to the system by calling
malloc_trim(pad). This function resizes the data segment, leaving
at least pad bytes at the end of it and failing if less than one
page worth of bytes can be freed. Segment size is always a multiple
of one page, which is 4,096 bytes on i386. The size of the memory
available to be trimmed is stored in the keepcost parameter of the
struct returned by mallinfo(). Automatic trimming is done inside
the free() function by calling memory_trim(), if the current value
of keepcost is higher than the M_TRIM_THRESHOLD value, and by using
the value of M_TOP_PAD as the argument.</p><p><a href="6390t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. mallopt() Parameters Mapped
to Environment Variables</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x233a318"></a>Memory Debugging: Consistency Checks</h2></div></div><p>Debugging memory is often one of the most time-consuming
tasks when developing complex programs. The two basic aspects of
this problem are checking memory corruption and tracing block
allocation and release.</p><p>Memory corruption happens when writing to a location lying
inside the legal data segment but outside the boundaries of the
memory block you intended to use. An example is writing beyond an
array's end. In fact, if you were to write outside the legal data
segment, a segmentation fault would halt the program immediately or
trigger the appropriate signal handler, allowing you to identify
the misbehaving instruction. Memory corruption is thus more subtle,
because it can pass unnoticed and cause a faulty behavior in a part
of the program quite far from the offending part. For this reason,
the sooner you detect it in the program, the higher your chances
are of catching the bug.</p><p>Corruption may affect other memory blocks (messing with the
application data) and the heap management structures. In the former
case, the only symptom that something is going wrong comes from
analyzing your own data structures. In the latter case, you can
rely on some specific GNU libc consistency check mechanisms that
alert you when something wrong is detected.</p><p>Memory checking in a program can be enabled as automatic or
manual. The former is done by setting the environment variable
MALLOC_CHECK_:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MALLOC_CHECK_=1 my_prog
</pre><p>This mechanism is able to catch a fair number of boundary
overflows and, in some cases, to protect the program from crashing.
The action undertaken when a fault is detected depends on the value
of MALLOC_CHECK_: 1 prints a warning message to stderr but does not
abort the program; 2 aborts the program without any output; and 3
combines the effects of 1 and 2.
</p><p>Automatic checking takes place only when memory-related
functions are invoked. That is, if you write beyond an array's end,
it won't be noticed until the next malloc() or free() call. Also,
not all the errors are caught, and the information you obtain is
not always extremely useful. In the case of free(), you know which
pointer was being freed when the error was detected, but that gives
no hint whatsoever as to who trashed the heap. In the case of
errors detected during an allocation, you merely receive a &ldquo;heap
corrupted&rdquo; message.</p><p>The alternative is to place manual checkpoints here and there
in the program. To do this, you must call the mcheck() function at
the beginning of the program. This function allows you to install a
custom memory fault handler that can be invoked each time heap
corruption is detected. A default handler also is available if you
don't provide your own. Once mcheck() has been called, all the
consistency checks you get with MALLOC_CHECK_ are in place.
Moreover, you can call the mprobe() function manually to force a
check on a given memory pointer at any time. Values returned by
mprobe() are summarized in the Sidebar &ldquo;mprobe() Results&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="6390s2.html" target="_self">mprobe() Results</a></p><p>If you want to check the whole heap and not only one block,
you can call mcheck_check_all() to walk through all the active
blocks. You also can instruct the memory management routines to use
mcheck_check_all(), instead of checking only the current block by
initializing mcheck_pedantic() instead of mcheck(). Be aware,
though, that this approach is rather time consuming.</p><p>A third way to enable memory checking is to link your program
with libmcheck:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc myprog.c -o myprog -lmcheck
</pre><p>The mcheck() function is called automatically before the
first memory allocation takes place&mdash;useful in those cases when
some dynamic blocks are allocated before entering main().
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x233a898"></a>Memory Debugging: Tracing Blocks</h2></div></div><p>Tracing the history of memory blocks helps in finding
problems related to memory leaks and usage or release of already
freed blocks. For this purpose, the GNU C library offers a tracing
facility that is enabled by calling the mtrace() function. Once
this call is made, every heap operation is logged to a file whose
name must be specified in the environment variable MALLOC_TRACE.
Analysis of the log file then can be performed off-line using a
Perl script that is provided with the library and called, not
surprisingly, mtrace. Logging can be stopped by calling muntrace(),
but keep in mind that applying tracing to portions of your program
may invalidate the result of post-processing. For example, false
leaks may be detected if you allocate one block while tracing and
then free it after muntrace().</p><p><a href="6390l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Tracing with
mtrace()</a></p><p>Here is a sample tracing session using the program in Listing
3:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcc -g Listing_3.c -o Listing_3
$ MALLOC_TRACE="trace.log" ./Listing_3
$ mtrace trace.log
Memory not freed:
-----------------
   Address     Size     Caller
0x08049718      0xa  at malloc_debug/Listing_3.c:9
</pre><p>Memory tracing has nothing to do with protection from errors;
calling mtrace() won't prevent the program from crashing. Even
worse, if the program segfaults, the trace file is likely to be
truncated and tracing may be inconsistent. To protect against this
risk, it is always a good idea to install a SIGSEGV handler that
calls muntrace(), because it closes the trace file before aborting
(Listing 4). More information on memory tracing can be found on the
libc info page.
</p><p><a href="6390l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Remember to call
muntrace() in the SIGSEGV handler.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x233ac08"></a>Debugging Internals</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes the standard debugging facilities provided by the
GNU C library may not be suited to the particular needs of your
program. In this case, you can resort either to an external memory
debugging tool (see Resources) or carve your own inside the
library. Doing this is simply a matter of writing three functions
and hooking them to these predefined variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>__malloc_hook points to a function to be called
when the user calls malloc(). You can do your own checks and
accounting here, and then call the real malloc() to get the memory
that was requested.</p></li><li><p>__free_hook points to a function called instead of
the standard free().</p></li><li><p>__malloc_initialize_hook points to a function
called when the memory management system is initialized. This
allows you to perform some operations, say, setting the values of
the previous hooks, before any memory-related operation takes
place.</p></li></ul></div><p>Hooks also are available for other memory-related calls,
including realloc(), calloc() and so on. Be sure to save the
previous values of the hooks and restore them before calling
malloc() or free() inside your routines. If you fail to do so,
infinite recursion prevents your code from working. Have a look at
the example given in the libc info page for memory debugging to see
all the nifty details.</p><p>As a final note, consider that these hooks also are used by
the mcheck and mtrace systems. It's a good idea to be careful when
using all of them combined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2241580.0x23318b8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The GNU C library offers several extensions that turn out to
be quite useful when dealing with memory. If you want to fine-tune
your application's memory usage or build a memory debugging
solution tailored to your needs, you probably will find these tools
helpful or, at least, a good starting point to develop your own
mechanisms.</p><p><a href="6390s4.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
