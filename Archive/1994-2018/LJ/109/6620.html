Development</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>devfs</b></span> filesystem work by
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Gooch</b></span> may be coming out of
the kernel. At the end of December 2002, <span   class="bold"><b>Adam
J. Richter</b></span> announced a patch to replace devfs with a new
mechanism based on <span   class="bold"><b>RamFS</b></span>. The new
system attempted to mimic devfs' behavior in many ways, though Adam
did not intend to include all of the devfs functionality in the
RamFS system. He wanted his implementation to be, in part, a
cleanup of the devfs interface, so that features used only by few
systems might be replaced with other methods. As a result of this
restructuring, he managed to reduce the size of the code to
one-fourth of what it had been. The devfs system always has been
controversial, and <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds'</b></span>
decision to include it in the official tree was even more so. Folks
like <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span> and others
have firmly refused to use it on grounds that it simply wasn't
coded well enough. Shortly before Adam announced his own work,
Alexander had begun an invasive cleanup and restructuring of the
devfs code. Richard, having struggled for years to produce devfs
and make it available in timely patches, seems to have vanished
entirely from the kernel mailing list.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>sysfs</b></span> filesystem is
intended to be a replacement for /proc and other methods of
exposing kernel data to user space. It began as a tool for driver
writers, but its use was broadened in 2002 to all parts of the
kernel. Since then, there has been an ongoing effort to migrate a
variety of other interfaces to sysfs. In January 2003,
/proc/cpufreq came under the knife when
<span   class="bold"><b>Dominik Brodowski</b></span> marked that
interface deprecated in favor of a new sysfs interface in the
cpufreq core code. <span   class="bold"><b>Patrick Mochel</b></span>
also had a hand in this, making sure Dominik's work matched up with
all the latest sysfs features. Later that month,
<span   class="bold"><b>Stanley Wang</b></span> sent some code to
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> to replace
pcihpfs with a sysfs interface. In this case, however, sysfs was
not up to the task as the needed hot-plugging code was not yet
fully in place. No problem. Greg coded up the needed sysfs feature
and sent it to Patrick.</p><p>One day in January 2003, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan
Cox</b></span> happened to mention that the tty code in the 2.5
tree was badly broken and had been for a while, primarily as a
result of locking changes in the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel
preemption</b></span> code. This came as a surprise to many people,
and some wondered why this was the first they'd heard of it,
especially because the 2.5 tree was already in feature-freeze,
headed for 2.6 or 3.0. Greg Kroah-Hartman looked at the problem and
was horrified. He said it was not going to be easy to fix and was
most likely something for the next development tree. But Alan said
this wasn't an option, because the tty code was broken already and
had to be fixed before the next stable series.</p><p>Traditionally, the Linux kernel has been compilable only with
the GNU C compiler, and even then it often has been necessary to
use a particular version of the compiler to compile particular
versions of the kernel. The kernel always has depended on GCC
extensions, and the relationship between kernel and compiler has
been intertwined for years, like an old married couple. Therefore,
various people were shocked to learn that the kernel also could be
compiled with Intel's C++ compiler,
<span   class="bold"><b>icc</b></span>. Apparently, Intel has had
this as a goal for quite some time, and they've even submitted
patches to Linus with the sole purpose of enabling their compiler
to handle the kernel source tree.</p><p>It's always nice to learn that the feature you desire already
has been implemented. According to the documentation (at least as
of late January 2003), the only filesystem with
<span   class="bold"><b>quota</b></span> support was ext2. However,
apparently work has been going on behind the scenes, because
ReiserFS, ext3, UFS and UDF now support quotas.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6620f1.large.jpg"><img src="6620f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

computing, moving from the web-centric workloads, where they are
already well established, and moving into application-serving and
database-serving workloads. This move is being made possible as
ISVs (independent software vendors) port more applications that
formerly had been running only on UNIX servers and Windows servers
to Linux servers. IDC expects that Linux servers will continue to
evolve, both in &ldquo;scale out&rdquo; clustered configurations for
technical and commercial computing and in &ldquo;scale up&rdquo;
configurations for larger databases with a single-system

GPL: One Step Ahead toward Building Carrier-Grade Linux
Clusters</h2></div></div><p>Ericsson released the source code for TIPC (Telecom
Inter-Process Communication) to the Open Source community on
February 3, 2003 under the GNU General Public License (GPL). TIPC
is a specially designed protocol for intracluster communication and
has been used as a part of Ericsson products for years, deployed at
hundreds of sites around the globe. It is now ported to Linux and
is implemented as a loadable kernel module.</p><p>TIPC is a useful toolbox for anyone wanting to develop or use
carrier-grade Linux clusters. It provides the necessary
infrastructure for cluster, network and software management
functionality.</p><p>The functional addressing scheme seems to be unique, as is
the subscription services and agile connection concept. The
signaling link implementation, providing full load sharing and safe
failover over any type of bearer is also an asset.</p><p>TIPC features include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Full location transparency: TIPC provides a
functional addressing scheme, hiding all aspects of the cluster's
physical topology for the application programs. Mapping between
functional and physical addresses is performed transparently and on
the fly using a distributed, internal translation table.</p></li><li><p>Lightweight, &ldquo;agile&rdquo; connections: by avoiding any
hidden protocol messages, the message exchange within a
transaction, including connection setup, short data transfer and
shutdown, can be tailor-made by the user and, hence, be made more
efficient. An established connection will react to and report a
problem to the application upon any kind of service failure.</p></li><li><p>Generic, adaptive, signaling link protocol: tasks
that typically are implemented in the transport layer, such as
retransmission, segmentation, bundling and continuity check, are
pushed down to the signaling link layer. This makes the link layer
more complex but provides better resource utilization and results
in a more efficient stack. Signaling links are tightly supervised
by a continuity check of configurable frequency and are able to
detect and report link failures within a fraction of a second.
Failover to redundant links in such cases is handled transparently
and is disturbance-free. Signaling links are self-configuring,
using a broadcast/multicast neighbour-detection protocol when
possible.</p></li><li><p>Performance: TIPC transfers short (&lt; 1KB) single
messages between processors, 25-35% faster than TCP/IP and with
comparable speed for larger messages. For intraprocessor messages,
delivery speed is 75% better. Furthermore, by using the lightweight
connection mechanism, a transaction can be performed by exchanging
as few as two messages, to be compared with a minimum of nine in
TCP/IP. Hence, short transactions, typical in telecom applications,
can be performed in a fraction of the time of corresponding TCP
transactions.</p></li><li><p>Quality of service: in-sequence, loss-free message
delivery can be guaranteed in both connection-oriented and
connectionless mode. In case of destination unavailability,
nondelivered messages are returned to the sender along with an
error code indicating the cause of the problem.</p></li><li><p>Subscription services: it is possible for
application programs to subscribe for the
availability/non-availability of functional and physical addresses.
This means it is easy to keep track of both functional and
topological changes in the cluster, as well as to synchronize the
startup of distributed applications.</p></li></ul></div><p>We are planning to write a full technical article on TIPC for
