    Linux already has bridged the product gap between early
    adoption and the mainstream. Now the big challenge is
    cultural.

first don't last. They're out on the front tables for you to
sample. If they sell well, there's no guarantee they'll stay on the
shelves for months, much less years. Even the biggest bookstores
don't have enough room to store a fraction of the new books that
wash in and out, like foam on a tide.
</p><p>Those that stay are part of the culture. You expect to find
them at a bookstore because their appeal endures. With fiction, the
appeal may last years, decades or centuries. Nonfiction books,
however, bear the burden of relevance. Among the nonfiction
categories, business books don't age as rapidly as sports and
travel titles, unless they're about technology. Books about
technology trends and companies tend to age as well as last week's
meat.</p><p>When I look at my bookshelves, I wince at titles like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big Tech Score</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing
Inter@ctivity</em></span>. It's not that any of these books contain
bad information; they simply speak of a time that is going or
gone.</p><p>One exception is the work of Geoffrey A. Moore. Although his
books are packed with examples from companies whose names are no
longer in use, his insights about technology adoption remain
relevant, especially (and ironically) for Linux. In fact, I think
Moore's technology adoption model is a handy way to make sense of
Linux's quietly growing success inside large enterprises. It also
will be useful when it is time to grok Linux's inevitable success
on desktops as well.</p><p>Moore's model is an old one: the adoption curve, which dates
back to Everett M. Rogers' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Diffusion of
Innovations</em></span>, first published in 1962 and still going
strong, broken into pieces (Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6629f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Adoption Curve
</p></div></div><p>His main focus is the chasm between early adopters and the
early majority. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crossing the Chasm</em></span> (1991)
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inside the Tornado</em></span> (1995), Moore described
the width of the chasm in terms of cultural opposites. According to
Moore, the techie innovators and visionary early adopters on the
left side of the chasm are radically different from the pragmatic
early majority (Table 1).</p><p><a href="6629t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Cultural Opposites [from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Inside the Tornado</em></span>, page 18]</a></p><p>What appeals to both groups is also radically different.
Techies and visionaries care about product qualities such as speed,
design, ease of use, price, novel features and functions,
impressive demos and trade-press coverage. Pragmatists care about
reliable solutions, third-party support, de facto standards, cost
of ownership, quality of support and success of colleagues.</p><p>Notice something funny? Did Linux skip a generation here? As
a product, isn't Linux almost profoundly pragmatic? And, isn't it
strange that what made Linux's visionaries excited was a roster of
mostly pragmatic values?</p><p>The graph in Figure 1 isn't Moore's; it's Don Norman's
version of Moore's curve. Dr Norman
(<a href="http://www.jnd.org" target="_self">www.jnd.org</a>), a scientist
whose dozens of books include such classics as <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Design
of Everyday Things</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Invisible
Computer</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Things That Make Us
Smart</em></span>, is a fan of Moore and his books. About
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Crossing the Chasm</em></span> he says
(<a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/life_cycle_of_techno.html" target="_self">www.jnd.org/dn.mss/life_cycle_of_techno.html</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The classic marketing book for high-technology
companies, widely read and discussed, but almost never followed.
Why is it so difficult for a high-technology company to understand
that late adopters of a technology are very, very different from
the technology enthusiasts who made the company successful? Because
the whole culture of the company is based on its wildly successful
teenage years, and high-tech companies hate to grow up. Immaturity
is embedded in the culture. Technology is easy to change. Culture
is hard.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the culture Moore and Norman talk about is on the supply
side&mdash;it's the culture of companies who make their living selling
technology. It's different with Linux. &ldquo;Linux company&rdquo; has always
had an oxymoronic quality. Lately I've begun to think there never
has been such a thing as a &ldquo;Linux company&rdquo;. Linux is too deep,
too infrastructural, too free. Yes, you can productize and brand
it, just as Pepsi productizes filtered water and sells it as
Aquafina. But, like air and water, Linux is too elemental to be a
product in itself. Here's how Don Norman puts the distinction:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There is a big difference between infrastructure
products, which I call non-substitutable goods, and traditional
products, substitutable goods. With traditional goods, a company
can survive with a stable, but non-dominant market share. Coke and
Pepsi both survive. Cereals and soaps have multiple brands. With
infrastructure goods, there can be just one. MS-DOS won over the
Macintosh OS, and that was that. MS-DOS transitioned to Windows,
and the dominance continued. VHS tape triumphed over Beta. Most
infrastructures are dictated by the government, which assures
agreement to a single standard. When there is no standard, as in AM
stereo or digital cellular options in the US, there is
chaos.</p></blockquote></div>

He's right&mdash;if we're talking about the present moment in time. But
reports are coming in from rank-and-file infrastructure builders at
the world's biggest technology companies. At FedEx, Boeing, General
Electric, Nokia, Sony, Matsushita, Philips and the rest of them,
Linux is becoming the infrastructural standard. It's not killing
off Windows; it's simply supplanting it as infrastructure. Where
Windows persists, it's being repositioned as a &ldquo;platform&rdquo; rather
than as a standard. In Don Norman's terms, Linux is becoming
non-substitutable while Windows is becoming substitutable.
</p><p>When Don Norman wrote that paragraph, DOS/Windows was de
facto infrastructure. What's happened since then is what many in
our community have expected for a very long time: free forms of
UNIX eventually will find adoption as universal infrastructure.
Sure enough, today most web servers run on Linux or BSD. Sony,
Matsushita, Philips and a pile of other consumer electronics giants
are codeveloping a free and open embedded Linux distro for their
own future product generations. DOS/Windows, which quietly used to
serve as the OS for countless cash registers and point-of-sale
(POS) terminals, is being replaced rapidly by new models that run
on Linux.</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inside the Tornado</em></span>, Geoffrey Moore
subdivides early adoption into two stages: The Bowling Alley and
The Tornado. The Bowling Alley is &ldquo;a period of niche-based
adoption in advance of the general marketplace, driven by
compelling customer needs and the willingness of vendors to craft
niche-specific whole products.&rdquo; The Tornado is &ldquo;a period of
mass-market adoption, when the general marketplace switches over to
the new infrastructure paradigm.&rdquo; These are followed by Main
Street, &ldquo;a period of after-market development when the base
infrastructure has been deployed and the goal now is to flesh out
its potential.&rdquo;</p><p>For web servers, database servers, rendering farms,
point-of-sale systems and a variety of other niche categories,
Linux has been bowling strikes for several years now. Now we're
moving inside the tornado, big time.</p><p>But it's a stealth tornado, because few companies on the
supply side (IBM is a huge exception) even bother to make a big
thing about it. The real leadership is happening on the demand
side, among the pragmatists.</p><p>Here's Linux. It's lying around looking useful. A lot of
technologists know their way around or can learn it easily. It's
free. There's no vendor lock-in. There are no royalties or other
fees to pay. It's extremely useful as building material. There are
lots of tools you can use to build with it, and most of those are
free too. The only problem is PR; it still looks like it's a
Visionary Thing.</p><p>But that image fits a pattern too. This one is described by
Clayton Cristensen in another classic, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Innovator's
Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail</em></span>
(Harvard Business School Press, 1997). Cristensen says Great Firms
are innovative by nature (witness Microsoft's defensive talk about
their right to innovate), but their innovations are incremental.
They improve the proven in gradual steps; they don't tip over their
cash cows&mdash;and for very good reasons.</p><p>One is dependence on customers and investors as sole
resources. Cristensen says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>While managers think they control the flow of
resources in their firms, in the end it is customers and investors
who dictate how money will be spent because companies with
investment patterns that don't satisfy their customers don't
survive. The highest-performing companies in fact are those that
are best at killing ideas that their customers don't want. As a
result, these companies find it very difficult to invest adequate
resources in disruptive technologies&mdash;lower-margin opportunities
that their customers don't want&mdash;until their customers want them.
And by then it's too late.</p></blockquote></div><p>Other reasons for avoiding disruptive technologies are
&ldquo;small markets don't solve the growth needs of large companies&rdquo;
and &ldquo;markets that don't exist can't be analysed&rdquo;. On that last
point, Cristensen says:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Because the vast majority of innovations are
sustaining in character, most executives have learned to manage
innovation in a sustaining context, where analysis and planning
were feasible. In dealing with disruptive technologies leading to
new markets, however, market researchers and business planners have
consistently dismal records. In fact, based upon evidence from the
disk drive, motorcycle, and microprocessor industries, the only
thing we may know for sure when we read experts' forecasts about
how large emerging markets will become is that they are
wrong.</p></blockquote></div>

All disruptive technologies, Cristensen says, are not taken
seriously at first. They look like toys. They seem underpowered.
The wrong people are selling and adopting them. They seem to be
missing crucial features and functions. They don't fit anywhere in
current product lines. They're not &ldquo;standard&rdquo;. And because they
start out that way, disruptive technologies remain ignored,
underestimated and misunderstood, even while they continuously
improve. That's why customers discover disruptive technology
advantages ahead of the &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; vendors whose gradually
improving goods are suddenly made obsolete.
</p><p>Linux is even more disruptive than any of Cristensen's
examples, because its primary movement isn't from companies to
customers&mdash;it's from hackers to customers. The creators of free
tools, components and applications make the products of their
labors available to anyone. In this respect, Linux resembles such
natural building materials as rocks, wood, iron and concrete. The
difference is that Linux occurs in human nature.</p><p>So companies don't &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; Linux so much as they mine and
harvest it. Only, because it's digital stuff, there's no scarcity.
That makes it infinitely less expensive than cheap lumber, rock,
minerals and petroleum. All of which make Linux that much easier to
adopt and that much more disruptive.</p><p>The remaining challenge, then, is cultural. There the chasm
remains intact. On one side we have a bunch of techies who care
deeply about the principles that brought Linux into the world and
that made it so useful to so many at so little cost. They get
worked up over ethical issues and about licenses like the GPL,
which respects the nature of Linux and its development while hardly
caring at all about its commercial potential. On the other side we
have a bunch of techies who care deeply about solving problems and
making things work, who hardly care at all about the political and
moral issues that get the first side so worked up.</p><p>In fact, the two sides aren't opposed. They're just different
constituencies with different priorities. The market logic is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>, not <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>. We'll know
we've bridged that chasm when we stop making a big deal about it.
At that point we'll all be on Main Street.</p></div></div>
