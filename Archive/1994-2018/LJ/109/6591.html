replacing Microsoft Exchange with Linux [&ldquo;Understanding and
Replacing Microsoft Exchange&rdquo; by Tom Adelstein,
<i  >LJ</i>, February 2003]. The article didn't
explicitly state you were trying to replace Microsoft Exchange 5.5,
but it was obvious to me that was the version you were working
with. Microsoft's Exchange 5.5 was limited in the total size of the
database, but that has changed in Exchange 2000 and Titanium.
Exchange 2000's Exchange Storage Engine has been rewritten to allow
much larger database sizes, which would be limited only to the
total capacity of the hardware on which the database would reside.
Also, I fail to understand the reasoning of why IMAP was provided
as a connection mechanism. IMAP will provide you with a way to
preview the e-mail message. Does your DLL plugin to Outlook provide
a way for the message to remain on the e-mail server?</p><p>&mdash;Chris Lynch, Network Engineer</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom Adelstein's reply:</b></span>
Thanks for your thoughtful letter. I appreciate your detailed
understanding of Exchange. It is quite impressive. Our goal at
Bynari was to create an RFC-compliant platform that allowed
Microsoft Outlook to run in corporate workgroup mode. In the case
of Outlook 2002, we wanted to provide calendar sharing and
delegation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x149e580.0x15963f8"></a><span   class="emphasis"><em>A Bas le Franglais</em></span>!</h2></div></div><p>I have been a happy <i  >LJ</i> subscriber for

clustering the previously unclustered [From the Editor by Don
Marti, <i  >LJ</i>, February 2003]. I seem to be unable
to convince the powers that be at some CAD and CAD/CAM firms that
this is an option. Therefore, I would very much like to get
information on how to make programs that are not enabled for
cluster technologies to work with cluster hardware
configurations.</p><p>&mdash;Darald</p><p>If you have one huge, slow process, you'll probably need to

led readers to believe that Geeklog is a fork of PHP-Nuke
[&ldquo;Building with Blogs&rdquo; by Doc Searls and Dave Sifry]. Much
respect needs to be given to PHP-Nuke for helping to spur the
weblog phenomenon, and I think the article presented that respect.
However, Geeklog is not a fork of PHP-Nuke. Also, the article
should have mentioned

on Linux&rdquo; (<i  >LJ</i>, March 2003) appears to be
mistitled. Mr. Schoen did not provide evidence on the MPAA making
any form of attack on Linux or on any free operating system in the
article. On a side note, he wrote, &ldquo;Reporters were barred from
meetings, which had a $100-per-meeting admission fee.&rdquo; Were
reporters specifically barred or was it just that reporters would
have to pay $100 per meeting?</p><p>&mdash;Jason</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Seth Schoen replies:</b></span>
Magazine editors have little space available for titles, so I could
see where they would feel the need to condense &ldquo;Broadcast Flag:
MPAA's Latest Attack on the Right to Use Free Software to Lawfully
Make and Interoperate with Recordings of Copyrighted Audiovisual
Works&rdquo; (which is what I would have called it) to &ldquo;Broadcast Flag:
MPAA's Latest Attack on Linux&rdquo;. Reporters were specifically barred
from meetings; they tried to participate, and they were kicked
out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x149e580.0x1596ea0"></a>Show Us Your Linux License Plate</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6591f1.jpg"></div><p>I was pleased to see the LINUX license plate in your February
2003 issue [Letters], particularly as I have the same five letters

chosen in my home state (Northern Territory, Australia). Having a

2001, when our son was born, my wife and I were having trouble
coming up with a name, and we remembered Eric from <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It sounded better than anything we had thought

</p><p>In the March 2003 issue, the From the Editor column talks
about community and the fear of spam people have when posting on
Usenet or web forums. But there is something old that has become
new. Cheap hardware and cable modems have caused a renaissance in

astronomers at Mauna Kea regularly install Linux at 14,000 feet. At

production. So quickly in fact, it was only running on the PC
running Linux that I used in development. It became the only Linux
server in our otherwise all-Windows data center. That was last
October. I never did see a new server, but the application just
stayed up and worked. Then last Friday, it suddenly went dark.
After being yelled at for how unreliable my &ldquo;toy&rdquo; was, I finally
got one of our Windows Network &ldquo;Engineers&rdquo; to admit, &ldquo;Well, we
saw that box running in the data center, but because no one had
touched it in months, we figured no one was using it.&rdquo; I guess
