    A preview of the 2.6 kernel and the audio excellence of
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc14580.0xd0c5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As this issue goes to the printer, kernel
development is in feature-freeze. Pretty soon comes the fun
part&mdash;testing. Almost as important as the work the kernel
developers do is the work the kernel testers do. And you don't have
to be a kernel expert to test the pre-2.6 kernels on your hardware
or your application. By the time you read this, your favorite Linux
news sites and mailing lists already might be getting &ldquo;Please
test&rdquo; messages. Watch your favorite Linux sites, including
<a href="/" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>, for news about the
kernel testing process and how you can help.
</p><p>Can Linux do for music what it did for server applications?
Ask Dave Phillips. His
<a href="http://linux-sound.org" target="_self">linux-sound.org</a> web
site is a resource for everything from hard-disk recorders to music
notation editors. This month, he's written a massive roundup of
softsynths, software that uses a bewildering array of techniques to
turn your Linux box into a synthesizer studio. Plug in a MIDI
keyboard or run a sequencer, and follow along on page 80.</p><p>If you practice, soon you'll be listening to music you made,
and it will sound better than CDs you buy from the major labels.
Why? Rip Rowan explained it best on
<a href="http://prorec.com" target="_self">prorec.com</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Record labels have never really understood what
makes a record sound good and frankly, few even care....For some
reason, record labels have it in their heads that LOUD equals good,
and therefore, LOUDER equals better. Not caring to understand even
the basics of audio, these morons simply demand more volume
(typically from the mastering engineer) and really don't understand
or care about the consequences of their demands.</p></blockquote></div><p>So using the audio excellence of Linux to rip major-label CDs
is as pointless as burning copies of Xenix or SCO OpenServer.
Record your own stuff. Freedom-loving hackers have reinvented the
way we get operating systems and made them better. Now you can be
the one to reinvent the way people get music, and make music
better.
</p><p>Two of the biggest advantages of 2.6 are going to be the
included ALSA sound drivers and some dramatic improvements in
latency that will make out-of-the-box distributions suitable for
studio-quality audio. Preemptible kernel hacker Robert Love covers
these and more on page 52.</p><p>If your need for raw software speed is greater than your
attachment to little features like hardware memory protection, or
if your embedded application is so important that if it goes down
the machine might as well have crashed, you're the kind of person
who might want to try Kernel Mode Linux. Toshiyuki Maeda explains
how to make any application into a part of the kernel on page
62.</p><p>Hans Reiser follows up with more on the Reiser4 filesystem,
one of several that are new for 2.6, on page 68. And, you might
notice a few changes when you configure and build the new kernel.
Greg Kroah-Hartman fills us in on what to expect on page 62.</p><p>Free software will always be an excellent choice for security
and network applications, and a good example is the beginning of
Mick Bauer's tutorial on Firewall Builder on page 30. The kernel is
only a beginning. Freedom works. Use it.</p></div></div>
