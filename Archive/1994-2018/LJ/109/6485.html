is hard. The kernel is a complex environment to master, and small
mistakes can cause severe data corruption. Filesystems, however,
offer a clean data access mechanism that is transparent to user
applications, which is why developers always desire to add new
features to filesystems. In this article, we provide a quick
introduction so you can add new functionality to existing
filesystems without having to become a kernel or filesystems
expert.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13e97c0"></a>So You Want to Be a Filesystem
Developer?</h2></div></div><p>Although Linux supports many filesystems, they are pretty
similar: disk-based filesystems, network-based filesystems, etc.
Making a filesystem stable and efficient takes years of effort, and
once it's stable and working, you don't want to break it by
throwing in new features. Besides, maintainers of filesystems
rarely accept feature-enhancement patches to their stable
filesystems. So, it is no surprise that the most popular
filesystems currently in use have not fundamentally changed in
years.</p><p>Suppose you want to write a simple encryption filesystem that
uses a single fixed cipher key to encrypt file data. Getting
portable C code for various ciphers is easy. Next, you have to tie
the calls to encrypt and decrypt data buffers into the filesystem.
Conceptually the problem is simple: encrypt any data that comes
from the write system call before it is written to disk, and
decrypt any data that comes from the disk before it is passed back
to the user process that called the read system call.</p><p>Your first inclination might be to copy the 5,000+ lines of
source code for ext2, study it and then add your cipher calls to
it. You should resist the urge to copy a whole other filesystem as
a starting point. Although it's only 5,000+ lines of code, kernel
code is at least an order of magnitude more complex to develop than
user-level code. If you actually end up putting the calls to your
cipher in the right place in this new filesystem, you'll find you
spent most of your time studying it, only to add a small number of
lines in some places. Even so, now you've got yourself a single
encrypting ext2 filesystem. What if you want an encrypting NFS
filesystem or any one of the plethora of other Linux
filesystems?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13e9978"></a>Incremental Filesystem Development</h2></div></div><p>Linux, like most OSes, separates its filesystem code into two
components: native filesystems (ext2, NFS, etc.) and a
general-purpose layer called the virtual filesystem (VFS). The VFS
is a layer that sits between system call entry points and native
filesystems. The VFS provides a uniform access mechanism to
filesystems without needing to know the details of those
filesystems. When filesystems are initialized in the kernel, they
install a set of function pointers (methods in OO-speak) for the
VFS to use. The VFS, in turn, calls these pointer functions
generically, without knowing which specific filesystem the pointers
represent. For example, an unlink system call gets translated into
a service routine sys_unlink, which invokes the vfs_unlink VFS
function, which invokes a filesystem-specific method by using its
installed function pointer: ext2_unlink for ext2, nfs_unlink for
NFS or the appropriate function for other filesystems. Throughout
this article, we refer to the specific filesystem method using
-&gt;, as in -&gt;unlink().</p><p>To solve this problem of how to develop our encryption
filesystem quickly, we employ the following adage: &ldquo;Any problem in
computer science can be solved by adding another level of
indirection.&rdquo; Luckily, the Linux VFS allows another filesystem to
be inserted right between the VFS and another filesystem. Figure 1
shows such a stackable encryption filesystem called Cryptfs.
Cryptfs is called stackable because it stacks on top of another
filesystem (ext2). Here, the VFS calls Cryptfs' -&gt;write() method
(cryptfs_write); Cryptfs encrypts the user data it receives and
passes it down by calling the -&gt;write() method below
(ext2_write).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6485f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An Example Stackable Encryption Filesystem
</p></div></div><p>In general, stackable filesystems can stand alone and be
mounted on top of any other existing filesystem mountpoint; this
means you only have to develop your (stackable) filesystem once,
and it will work with any other native (low-level) filesystem such
as ext2, NFS, etc. Moreover, as of Linux 2.4.20, stackable
filesystems even can be exported safely (via nfs-utils-1.0 or
newer) to remote NFS clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13e9ce8"></a>How a Stackable Filesystem Works</h2></div></div><p>The basic function of a stackable filesystem is to pass an
operation and its arguments to the lower-level filesystem. The
following distilled code snippet shows how a stackable null-mode
pass-through filesystem called Wrapfs handles the -&gt;unlink()
operation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int wrapfs_unlink(struct inode *dir,
                  struct dentry *dentry)
{
  int err = 0;
  struct inode *lower_dir;
  struct dentry *lower_dentry;
  lower_dir = get_lower_inode(dir);
  lower_dentry = get_lower_dentry(dentry);
  /* pre-call code can go here */
  err = lower_dir-&gt;i_op-&gt;unlink(lower_dir,
                                lower_dentry);
  /* post-call code can go here */
  return err;
}
</pre><p>When the VFS needs to unlink a file in a Wrapfs filesystem,
it calls wrapfs_unlink, passing it the inode of the directory in
which the file to remove resides (dir) and the name of the entry to
remove (encapsulated in dentry).
</p><p>Every filesystem keeps a set of objects that belong to it,
including inodes, directory entries and open files. When using
stacking, multiple objects represent the same file&mdash;only at
different layers. For example, our Cryptfs in Figure 1 may have to
keep a directory entry (dentry) object with the clear-text version
of the filename, while ext2 will keep another dentry with the
ciphertext (encrypted) version of the same name. To be truly
transparent to the VFS and other filesystems, stackable filesystems
keep multiple objects at each level.</p><p>This is why the first few actions that wrapfs_unlink takes
are to locate, from the arguments it gets, the inode and dentry
that correspond to the same objects, only at the filesystem mounted
below. These get_lower_* functions essentially follow pointers that
previously were stored in the private fields of Wrapfs' objects
when those objects were created. Once the lower objects are
located, the main magic of stacking takes place. We call the
lower-level filesystem's own -&gt;unlink() method, through the
lower-level directory inode, and pass it the two lower
objects.</p><p>Wrapfs is a full-fledged stackable null-layer (or loopback)
filesystem that simply passes all operations and objects
(unmodified) between the VFS and the lower filesystem. Wrapfs
itself, however, is not easy to write for one main reason; it has
to treat the lower filesystem as if it were the VFS, while
appearing to the real Linux VFS as a lower-level filesystem. This
dual role requires careful handling of locks, reference counts,
allocated memory and so on. Luckily, someone already wrote and
maintains Wrapfs. Therefore, Wrapfs serves as an excellent template
for you to modify and add new functionality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13e9fa8"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>Now that you understand how stacking works, what next? First,
we have to explore the places where we can insert our code into
Wrapfs. Referring back to the wrapfs_unlink code shown previously,
there are three such places that correspond to before, instead of
or after the call to the lower-level -&gt;unlink() method.</p><p>1) Pre-call: you can insert code before the call to the lower
-&gt;unlink(). For example, you could check if the user is trying
to delete an important file and prevent that from happening:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (strcmp(dentry-&gt;d_name.name,
           "vmlinuz") == 0)
return -EACCES;
</pre><p>2) Call: you could replace the entire call itself. For
example, instead of removing the file, you could rename it, as part
of a simple undo filesystem (we've all had our share of unintended
<b  >rm -f</b> commands).
</p><p>3) Post-call: here we could perform actions after the main
operation returned from the lower filesystem. For example, suppose
a malicious user tries to delete /etc/passwd, but the normal UNIX
permission checks prevent it. An administrator might want to log
such an action (using syslogd) as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (err == -EACCES &amp;&amp;
    strcmp(dentry-&gt;d_name.name,
           "passwd") == 0)
  printk("uid %d tried to delete passwd",
         current-&gt;fsuid);
</pre><p>where current is a global variable that always points to the
currently executing task (process), and -&gt;fsuid is the effective
UID of that process, for use by filesystems.
</p><p>These examples and those that follow have been simplified
somewhat to save space and to convey their essence. For example,
the d_name.name component is not null terminated, so memcmp will
have to be used with the proper length; or, to check that the file
referred to by the dentry is indeed the real /etc/passwd, the code
has to check that the filesystem is the root filesystem or compare
against the absolute pathname, using d_path(). For the complete
examples, tested under 2.4.20, see the FiST home page
(<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~ezk/research/fist" target="_self">www.cs.sunysb.edu/~ezk/research/fist</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13ea3c8"></a>Example: Who Watches the Snoopers</h2></div></div><p>UNIX tries to protect files from access by unauthorized
users. When a user tries to open a file to which they do not have
access, UNIX promptly returns a permission-denied error. Some users
like to snoop around the files of others, sometimes looking for
files mistakenly left unprotected or trying to guess names of files
that might exist in a searchable-only directory. Unfortunately,
even when those snooping users are unsuccessful, the victims of
such snooping often are unaware it took place.</p><p>One of the most common filesystem operations is
-&gt;lookup(), which occurs whenever a system call uses a file's
name. The kernel must translate that (string) name to an actual VFS
object, such as an inode, dentry or file. To detect snooping users,
we place the following code in snoopfs_lookup or
snoopfs_permission, right after it calls -&gt;lookup() on the lower
filesystem:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ((err == -EACCES ||
     err == -ENOENT) &amp;&amp;
    dir-&gt;i_uid != current-&gt;fsuid &amp;&amp;
    current-&gt;fsuid != 0)
  printk("snoop uid=%d pid=%d file=%s",
         current-&gt;fsuid, current-&gt;pid,
         dentry-&gt;d_name.name);
</pre><p>Here, we check the return code (err) from the call to the
lower -&gt;lookup(). If the status is EACCES (permission denied) or
ENOENT (no such file or directory) and if the directory's owner
(dir-&gt;i_uid) is different from that of the user running the
current task (current-&gt;fsuid) and the current user is not the
superuser (because root users can do anything), then it prints a
descriptive message identifying the snooping user. This message
typically is logged by syslogd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13ea5d8"></a>Example: Encryption Fit for a Caesar</h2></div></div><p>Wrapper technologies are particularly suitable for
security-related applications where wrapping, or monitoring, is
often useful. Not surprisingly, the most popular applications
developed from FiST are cryptographic filesystems. In this example,
we demonstrate a simple encryption filesystem that uses the rot13
cipher.</p><p>In this filesystem, we want to encrypt all file data using a
function (presumably already written) called rot13 that takes an
input buffer, output buffer and their lengths. However, unlike the
previous examples, there is no single method where you can place
the rot13() function to encrypt the file's data. In fact,
manipulating file data in any filesystem is rather complex because
it involves multiple methods, as well as two forms of accessing
file's data, the read and write system calls, which can work at any
file offset, and mmap, which works on whole pages. To make life
easier for stackable filesystem developers, Wrapfs consolidates all
of these methods into two simple calls: one to encode file data and
one to decode file data, both working on whole page-aligned data
pages (for example, 4KB on IA-32 systems). Using the Wrapfs
template, the only code you have to write to produce a rot13-based
encryption filesystem looks like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int
encode_block(void *in, void *out, int len)
{
  rot13(in, out, len);
  return len;
}
int
decode_block(void *in, void *out, int len)
{
  rot13(in, out, len);
  return len;
}
</pre><p>Wrapfs already contains all the complex code that handles
mixed reads, writes and memory-mapped operations. Wrapfs makes
calls to encode_block to encrypt a data page and to decode_block to
decrypt a data page (they are identical in this example).
</p><p>Of course, rot13 is hardly a practical cipher, but given this
simple example, you can build much stronger cryptographic
filesystems. Following this, we recently have built a powerful
cryptographic filesystem called NCryptfs (a successor to Cryptfs).
NCryptfs supports multiple ciphers; multiple keys per user, process
or group; multiple authentication schemes; key timeouts and
revocation; delegated privileges; and more&mdash;all with a negligible
performance overhead.</p><p>Wrapfs also supports manipulating filenames using two
additional routines to encode and decode filenames. One thing to
watch out for when encrypting filenames is that filenames must
remain valid after encryption. In other words, they cannot contain
nulls or &ldquo;/&rdquo; characters. A common solution is to uuencode the
file's name after encryption.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13ea898"></a>Example: Extending New Functionality to User
Applications</h2></div></div><p>In the wrapfs_unlink example, we suggested that instead of
deleting a file, you could rename it, thus saving a single backup
of deleted files. Suppose we call this filesystem unrmfs, in which
deleted files are instead renamed from their original name
<span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>.unrm. It might be
annoying if all of these .unrm files started appearing in your
directory, especially if you're expecting nothing there. Moreover,
this kind of functionality also could be used to fool attackers who
try to delete log files that may be used to track their actions. To
achieve this, however, the .unrm files must not be visible or
accessible to users by default.</p><p>To hide certain files in a filesystem, you have to do two
things. First, prevent the file from showing up in -&gt;readdir().
This is done by writing code in wrapfs_filldir that checks each
filename passed to -&gt;filldir() and returning NULL for those
files you do not want listed. Second, prevent users from directly
looking up the file by its name; this is done by checking for .unrm
files in the beginning of wrapfs_lookup.</p><p>Of course, hiding those files from all users isn't very
useful. Legitimate users must be able to access those files under
certain conditions. A simple approach might be to check the UID of
the calling process and to hide the .unrm files only from certain
users. A better approach would be to use the mother of all system
calls, ioctl. In Wrapfs, you can define as many new ioctls as you
like, and then write small user-level programs to use those ioctls.
This is, for example, the mechanism we use in encryption
filesystems for a user-level tool to pass a user's cipher key to
the kernel.</p><p>For our unrmfs, you could write a restore ioctl that takes a
file's name, <span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>, checks whether the file
<span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>.unrm exists and then renames
<span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>.unrm back to <span   class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>,
effectively unhiding it from unrmfs. The following example shows a
sketch of this code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* len: length of source file */
newname = kmalloc(len+6, GFP_KERNEL);
strncpy_from_user(newname, ioctl_arg, len);
strcat(newname, ".unrm");
lower_dir = get_lower_inode(dir);
src = lookup_one_len(lower_dir, newname);
if (IS_ERR(src))
  return PTR_ERR(src);
dst = lookup_one_len(lower_dir, name);
vfs_rename(lower_dir, src, lower_dir, dst);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f1580.0x13e15a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Filesystem development need not be difficult. Using stackable
filesystems, you can create new, useful and efficient filesystems
quickly&mdash;all without changing kernels or existing filesystems. The
examples in this article hopefully demonstrate the power of
stacking, from which you gradually can build more complex
filesystems. You can get the FiST software, documentation and many
