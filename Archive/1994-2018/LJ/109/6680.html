question that is becoming more and more common, because people and
distributions are choosing higher security as a default or as an
option. A possible reason that the user can't connect by SSH is the
/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files. Set <b  >sshd:

will SSH from, list only those hosts.</p><p>&mdash;Benjamin Judson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec4580.0xfbc348"></a>Partition Table Changes Don't Take</h2></div></div><p>I am using a Seagate ST32550 SCSI hard drive with an AHA1720

years nonstop&mdash;except for power failures&mdash;holding my DNS and
Sendmail. Suddenly, the user account I always use is no longer
allowed to log in. The only users that can log in are root and a
second user account, but I can't figure why that user account is
special. Although there's no login, I can <b  >su</b> to
any account by giving the correct password. The accounts are not
locked; the passwords have not expired, the passwords are correct;
the users have permissions on their home directories, and the
permissions on passwd and shadow are correct. I've tried creating
an account in the same group ID (admin) and groups as where the
special account is listed&mdash;the one that can log in&mdash;but it didn't
work. The messages in syslog are <b  >incorrect

<a href="mailto:juan.alvarez@thales-is.com">juan.alvarez@thales-is.com</a></p><p>Without a closer look at your system, the gut reaction to
this type of situation is to investigate the possibility of a
system intrusion. Telnet sends your password in the clear over the
network, and other d&aelig;mons installed on any five-year-old
distribution have had vulnerability reports over the past few
years. Your problem report does have that fishy smell. Barring any
problems on that end, you can investigate some configuration
facilities that control user logins. For example, is there an
/etc/nologin file? This prevents any non-root user from logging in,
and your extra user account may be given special treatment here if
it is a member of the root group in /etc/group. Also, examine
/etc/passwd and verify that the other users all have valid shells
and home directories.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,

a newer and more secure distribution. A second guess would be the
amount of available disk space.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>The two measures that prevent most security problems are 1)
remove or disable unused software, which should include telnet&mdash;use
OpenSSH and 2) subscribe to your distribution's security mailing
list to get news of updates, then install the updates when they're
available.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti,

run under Linux, which I'm quite happy about. However, I'm having a
problem with the servers and hope you can help. Our development
servers are Dell 2550 machines, and our production servers are Dell
2650s. We are running Red Hat 8.0 on the equipment, which runs fine
for the most part. We have had unexplained lockups, however, on all
the servers, in which the console becomes locked and the machine
has to be hard reset. No indication of what caused the lockup is
reported in any of the log files. After searching the Dell and Red
Hat forums I've found some help. Essentially, this help is to put
the option noapic on the kernel command line in the grub.conf file.
After doing this, the machines seem to run well. What does the
noapic command option do on an SMP system? And has anyone else
experienced this problem on Dell 2550/2650 machines?</p><p>&mdash;Doug Farrell,
<a href="mailto:dfarrell@grolier.com">dfarrell@grolier.com</a></p><p>The advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC)
replaces the standard, external interrupt controller with
functionality inside the CPU itself. It supports some neat tricks
such as performance counters and watchdog facilities. Normally,
this support is not supposed to interfere with systems that do not
have an APIC. However, in some instances this creates system
lockups such as the ones you've experienced. The major implication
of running in noapic mode is a performance hit, as interrupts are
not handled as efficiently. For systems that are heavily
interrupt-driven (this unfortunately includes those that do a lot
of networking work, such as web servers) this might be measurable.
Nonetheless, the benefits of SMP almost always outweigh this
impact. Some load testing on your end should help you identify the
maximum user loads that you can expect from your systems.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,

<a href="mailto:crossl@lakecitycc.edu">crossl@lakecitycc.edu</a></p><p>This message typically indicates that your BIOS was unable to
find a boot loader on your drive. If you installed LILO or another
boot manager when you installed Linux, chances are it was not
properly done, and you should double-check the parameters you used.
If you didn't install a boot manager, your problem is a bit easier
to identify. Either way, you should be able to use an emergency
recovery disk or the original installation disk to boot your
system. Then you can install the boot loader again.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
