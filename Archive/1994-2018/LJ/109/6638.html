    You won't look like Jeff Bridges, but do you get to wear the
    funky costumes?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd84580.0xe7c660"></a></h2></div></div><p>What do you mean, &ldquo;Who is inside the
computer?&rdquo; No one is inside the computer, Fran&ccedil;ois. Ah, I
see. I think you misunderstand the concept of this month's focus,
&ldquo;Kernel Internals&rdquo;. Why, the whole notion of there being anything
other than bits and bytes floating in the Linux kernel is pure
science fiction, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Qu'est-ce
que tu dis</em></span>? No, of course not. Inside the computer isn't
a real place, at least not in this world. Still...
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi</em></span>? Sorry, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. I was just remembering a movie from years ago,
where there really was an &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the computer, and programs
fought for their users against the MCP, the master control program.
Fran&ccedil;ois, what are you looking at?</p><p>Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare and excellent wine.
Please sit and I will have Fran&ccedil;ois fetch the wine. We have
some incredible French Canadian
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tourti&egrave;re</em></span> to serve tonight as well.
Fran&ccedil;ois, run to the cellar and fetch the wine. The 1997
Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is drinking exceptionally
well.</p><p>It is good to see you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.
Fran&ccedil;ois had this strange notion that kernel internals
implied something was going on inside his Linux system that
involved <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> people. That made me think of
the 1982 Disney film called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tron</em></span>. Inside the
computer, programs are engaged in gladiatorial battles, fighting
for their users. One of the deadly sports in this virtual world was
a lightcycle race. Contestants rode a kind of motorcycle that left
a wall of light in its wake. The cycles themselves can't stop. The
only thing you can do is ride, avoiding your opponents' walls while
trying to get them to crash into yours. The last program standing
wins.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please pour for our
guests, then head back to the kitchen for that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tourti&egrave;re</em></span>. As I was saying,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, as dated as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tron</em></span> appears in today's world, the lightcycle
battle was the inspiration for various arcade games based on the
simple concept of an ever-growing light trail that must be avoided
at all costs. That inspiration continues today and is represented
in several open-source projects.</p><p>Let's start with a lightcycle game you already may have on
your system. As part of the KDE games package, you'll find Matthias
Kiefer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>KTron</em></span>, a simple but highly functional
lightcycle game. You'll find it in your K menu under arcade games,
and the command name is <b  >ktron</b>. When the game
starts, you'll see two squares near the center of the screen, one
red and one blue. To play, press either your left or right cursor
and the race begins instantly (Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6638f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>KTron</em></span>: KDE's Own Lightcycle Game
</p></div></div><p>In order to change game play, click Settings on the menubar
and several modifications are at your disposal. For instance, if
the game is a little fast for you, tone down the velocity. Or,
speed it up if you are falling asleep at the lightcycle's wheel.
You also can change the size of the cycle's trail or modify the
default colors.</p><p>This little game is actually a lot of fun, particularly if
you change the size of the arena, but really to get the feel of a
lightcycle battle, you must enter the three-dimensional world.
That, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, is how you get into the
computer. You will need a 3-D accelerated video card and OpenGL or
Mesa 3-D video libraries.</p><p>As far as the card itself is concerned, many are extremely
well supported under Linux. Unfortunately, even when the card is
supported, the manufacturer of the card may not license the
accelerated driver for inclusion with the Linux distributions
themselves. That doesn't mean they aren't available, but you may
have to visit the vendor's site and download them. With some cards,
full 3-D acceleration is directly supported under XFree86. So, how
can you tell if you are ready to go? A quick way to test for the
presence of 3-D support is with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
glxinfo | grep rendering
</pre><p>The system should respond with this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
direct rendering: Yes
</pre>


Another fun little test you can perform involves running a program
called <span   class="bold"><b>gears</b></span> (part of the
Mesa-demos package). To do this, simply type the command
<b  >gears</b> at a shell prompt. Your hard work will be
rewarded with three gears spinning on your screen (Figure 2).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6638f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The 3-D gears Demo from Mesa
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Do not get too distracted by the spinning gears. Have another
sip of your wine, then look back at your terminal window. You will
see some statistics regarding the performance of your 3-D
hardware:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1778 frames in 5.001 seconds = 355.529 FPS
</pre><p>That result comes from my test system, which has an NVIDIA
GeForce2 card. This is actually a reasonably impressive hardware
performance. In contrast, my little notebook, which suffers from a
complete lack of accelerated hardware, yields this result:
<pre     class="programlisting">
312 frames in 5.004 seconds = 62.350 FPS
</pre>


Not having acceleration for your card doesn't stop the program from
working; it simply will run very, very slowly. Now that we've got
that out of the way, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us return
to the world of lightcycles in the third dimension with Manuel
Moos' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span>
(<a href="http://armagetron.sourceforge.net" target="_self">armagetron.sourceforge.net</a>).
As Manuel's home page suggests, think Armageddon with a &ldquo;tr&rdquo;
instead of that double &ldquo;d&rdquo;. Precompiled binaries were easy to
find, and the source, of course, is there as well.
</p><p>The first time I tried the game, I immediately crashed into
the wall. This was my experience the first three times or so, until
I realized that perhaps I needed to configure my keys for steering.
Navigate the menus to Player settings (whichever player number you
happen to be), then change the Input Configuration. Cursor down to
turn left and press Enter. You'll be asked to press the key you
wish to use for a left turn. I know it sounds crazy, but I chose
the left cursor key. Repeat the process for the right turn and
anything else you may wish to use in combat, such as instant chat
phrases so you can taunt other players with a single keystroke.
Exit that menu, then the one before it until you return to the main
menu.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6638f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A 3-D Lightcycle Race, Courtesy of
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>Now, from the Game menu, select Start Game.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span> is a great lightcycle game with an
omnipresent overhead camera that follows your moves and provides
some dizzying perspective changes on those instant, 90-degree turns
(Figure 3). <span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span> also is network
playable with up to 16 computers, each running four players.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span> is wonderfully addictive and,
as a result, comes with an absolutely essential feature: a Boss
key. In other words, if you happen to be playing a game of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span> over the network and the boss
approaches, press Shift-Esc, and the game ends and vanishes
instantly.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span> is great, but for something
approaching photo-realism, we have Andreas Umbach's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span>. As you might expect, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, this realism comes at a price in terms of hardware
and performance, but if you have the machine, you will not be
disappointed. You should have no problem finding precompiled
binaries (RPMs are available on
<a href="http://rpmfind.net" target="_self">rpmfind.net</a>), but the
source is always available. You can pick it up at
<a href="http://www.gltron.org" target="_self">www.gltron.org</a>.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span> is fast-paced (assuming proper
3-D hardware) with impressive graphics and a play mode that is sure
to raise your heart rate.</p><p>There are three main configuration menus for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span> (game, video and audio), and some of
these make it possible to change the game experience dramatically.
For instance, you can run <span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span> in
full-screen mode as well as windowed. Artpacks also are included in
the package so you can alter the look and feel. My favorite is
still the default (Figure 4), but I am somewhat fond of the
Metaltron artpack.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6638f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. <span  class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span>--So Good, You'll Feel You're
in the Computer
</p></div></div><p>What I like most about <span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span> is the
ability to pan with the mouse to create almost any camera view.
Press the spacebar to pause the game, then tilt or rotate your
point of view. If you really want to hone your skills in this 3-D
world, try changing your point of view relative to the arena and
restart the race. Controlling your lightcycle from the side is an
altogether different experience than it is from above or behind.
Try pressing F10 to change the camera angle and tracking. I find
the behind-camera viewpoint particularly interesting. It changes
your view so that you seem to be riding in the lightcycle
itself&mdash;very heady.</p><p>By default, a small 2-D map floats above the screen. If you
feel particularly cocky, try turning the map off.</p><p>In many ways, <span   class="emphasis"><em>GLTron</em></span> is the most
polished of the three games mentioned here, but it doesn't have the
network play of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Armagetron</em></span>. On the other hand,
as simple as <span   class="emphasis"><em>KTron</em></span> is, you can play it on any
system&mdash;accelerated hardware is not necessary.</p><p>So, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, as you can see, all your
workstations are set up with the three games as well as being fully
networked. Perhaps you would like another glass of wine before
entering the arena? Or maybe an espresso? Fran&ccedil;ois will be
happy to provide you with either.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, has the time passed so
quickly? As I cannot connect to your systems and pour you a glass
of wine, I must attend to it here before Fran&ccedil;ois and I
close the restaurant for the night. Fran&ccedil;ois, would you be
so kind as to refill our guests' glasses a final time? Until next
time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>!
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon app&eacute;tit</em></span>!</p><p><a href="6638s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
