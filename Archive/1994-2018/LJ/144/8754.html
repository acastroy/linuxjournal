All you need to know to install and use the powerful MediaWiki system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was first introduced to the idea of a wiki many years ago. A
colleague at work told me about a Web site that invited readers to
become writers and editors. Over time, he said, a wiki would grow to
include a great deal of knowledge, drawing from the collective
experience, without the need for any centrally coordinated assignment
or editing. My gut reaction was one of great ambivalence. On the one
hand, a community of well-meaning and well-disciplined users could
indeed use a wiki in many useful ways. But at the same time, it
seemed like an invitation for chaos. And, admittedly, chaos has
sometimes been the result.
</p><p>
Over the years, wikis have become increasingly common. Dozens of
different software packages are now available, in nearly every
programming language and for nearly every Web/database framework. The
question is no longer whether a wiki is available, or how easily one
can be installed, but rather whether a wiki is an appropriate tool for
your needs and which of the existing packages is the best fit for
your organization.
</p><p>
And although the jury is still out, at least in part, regarding the
long-term viability of public wikis, the amazing Wikipedia Project has
demonstrated that it is possible to have surprisingly good
results. A
research study released several weeks before I wrote this article
reported that when it comes to science-related articles, Wikipedia is
only slightly less accurate than Encyclopaedia Britanica. Given that
Britanica is written and edited by paid experts, while Wikipedia
relies on volunteers (who may, of course, still be experts), it is
clear that wikis do not necessarily lead to the chaos that I feared.
</p><p>
That said, I have a strong feeling Wikipedia's reputation was
preserved not because of the public's inherent love for wikis, but
because of a dedicated team of Wikipedians who operate behind the
scenes to ensure that the content is viable.
</p><p>
As I wrote above, there are many options for creating a wiki on your
own Web server. One of the best-known packages is the same one that
powers Wikipedia, known as MediaWiki. In this article, we
discuss how you can install MediaWiki on your own server, how you can create
and edit static content and how you can even create dynamic special
pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd558"></a>
Installing MediaWiki</h2></div></div><p>
Although Wikipedia contains an enormous amount of text, the MediaWiki
software on which it runs is surprisingly small, straightforward to
understand and easy to install. The software itself is written in
PHP, and it relies on a MySQL database for content and indexing. That
is, none of the pages on a MediaWiki site exist as files on disk;
instead, they are created on the fly by the PHP programs, bringing
together a number of elements for each individual visitor.
</p><p>
To install the MediaWiki software, you thus need a server running
both PHP and MySQL. PHP works on a number of platforms, but we will
assume, for the purposes of this article, that you are using the Apache
server with relatively recent versions of PHP (at least 4.1.2,
although 4.3 is preferred) and MySQL (at least 3.2.x, but 4.0.x is
preferred). Most modern Linux distributions either include PHP and
MySQL or make them available from on-line repositories without too
much trouble. You need administrative privileges for both Apache
and MySQL in order to install MediaWiki. If you don't run your own
server, you might need to ask the system administrator for some
help in modifying the appropriate configuration files.
</p><p>
Although you can download the MediaWiki software directly from SourceForge, you
should look for it on the main MediaWiki site,
<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org" target="_self">www.mediawiki.org</a>. Once on that page, click on the
versions and download link (on the right side of the page), and then
on the appropriate link for the current stable release. Download
an older or experimental release only if you understand the problems that
might be associated with it.
</p><p>
The software comes as a .tar.gz file containing the version number.
For example, the file that I downloaded is called
mediawiki-1.5.3.tar.gz, indicating that I downloaded version
1.5.3, current as of December 21, 2005. Keep that file in a
temporary location (I generally prefer to put such files in a
directory named /downloads); we will return to it after taking care of
our Apache configuration.
</p><p>
If your site will run only MediaWiki software, there is probably
no reason for you to modify your Apache configuration file,
traditionally named httpd.conf. In such cases, you can unpack the
.tar.gz file in your site's htdocs directory, as described in the
instructions on the MediaWiki site. If your distribution uses another
directory as its document root, you'll obviously have to adapt to
your distribution's preferences.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd818"></a>
Virtual Servers</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to put the MediaWiki installation in a virtual server
on an existing Apache installation, you need to modify the Apache
configuration file to create a new virtual host on your system.
Modern versions of HTTP require that a Web browser request a document
from a specific hostname. The virtual host feature in Apache allows one Web server to serve
documents for many different hostnames, even when all of the names resolve to a single IP address. If you just want to try MediaWiki without affecting the rest of your site, or if the
majority of your site runs under a framework (such as Zope or Ruby on
Rails) that is largely incompatible with MediaWiki, a virtual
host might well be a wise move. I often use such virtual hosts to
experiment with new software and configurations without potentially
endangering existing, stable sites.
</p><p>
Apache's VirtualHost sections allow you to configure one or more
such virtual servers, each with its own configuration. In configuring
MediaWiki for my system, I needed the following VirtualHost section in
httpd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;VirtualHost 69.55.225.93&gt;

ServerName wiki.lerner.co.il
    ServerAlias mediawiki.lerner.co.il wikipedia.lerner.co.il
ServerAdmin reuven@lerner.co.il

DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/www/
DirectoryIndex index.php

CustomLog
/usr/local/apache/v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/logs/access-log combined
CustomLog
/usr/local/apache/v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/logs/referer-log referer
ErrorLog /usr/local/apache/v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/logs/error-log

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The first two lines of this VirtualHost section define the name and
aliases for this new virtual server. By adding aliases, I ensure that
even if people enter a different name, they will get to the right
place. (Because I have asked my hosting company to alias all hostnames
in the lerner.co.il domain to my server's IP address, I can add and
remove new virtual hosts whenever I want, without having to modify the
DNS configuration.) I then set ServerAdmin to be my own e-mail
address, ensuring that error messages will direct people to me.
</p><p>
Next, I indicate that the root directory for the wiki&mdash;that is, where
Apache should look for the PHP programs that define it&mdash;is
under /usr/local/apache/v-sites, where I put all of the virtual
servers on my machine. Each site then gets a subdirectory according
to its name, with two directories (www and logs) under that. So
in the above configuration, I have defined the DocumentRoot to be
under v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/www, and I have put the access,
referer and error logs under v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/logs.
</p><p>
Once I have added the above configuration to httpd.conf, I restart
Apache. At this point, I'll get an error if I go to
http://wiki.lerner.co.il, as I haven't yet installed the software.
</p><p>
To install the MediaWiki software, I download the latest .tar.gz file,
and open it in the v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/apache/v-sites/wiki.lerner.co.il/
tar -zxvf /downloads/mediawiki-1.5.3.tar.gz
mv mediawiki-1.5.3 www
</pre>
</p><p>
After doing that, I pointed my Web browser to
http://wiki.lerner.co.il, and got a message saying that I still
needed to configure the software. But the permissions weren't set
quite right, meaning that MediaWiki was unable to write to its
configuration directory. Rather than aborting with a
hard-to-understand error message, MediaWiki kindly told me that there
was a problem with the filesystem permissions, and it even reminded me
how to use chmod to fix the problem.
</p><p>
After having changed the permissions, MediaWiki then showed me the
initial configuration screen. To be honest, I didn't have to do very
much; I entered the name of my wiki (ReuvenWiki), and I kept the
defaults for nearly everything else. I entered a password for the
WikiSysop user within the wiki system itself. And, I entered a
password for the database user and also entered the password for the
MySQL administrative user.
</p><p>
Remember, you're keeping track of three types of user names here,
which can be a bit tricky. Your Linux system has one set of users and
permissions, MySQL has its own set of users and permissions, and the
MediaWiki software also has its own set of users and permissions.
Although
this might seem like overkill, it provides a great deal of
flexibility, allowing you to run MediaWiki in a safe, secure environment.
</p><p>
Once I filled out all of the above information, I clicked on the
Install! button. Unlike many Web applications, which produce
output only when they have finished with their work, the MediaWiki
installer kindly provides updates as the installer is running, giving
you a sense of what it is doing and how much longer you might have to
wait. In the end, you should (hopefully) see a note indicating that
the installation was successful, and that you should move
config/LocalSettings.php into the parent directory (the www
directory):

<pre     class="programlisting">
mv -v config/LocalSettings.php .
</pre>
</p><p>
Having done that, I can re-enter the URL (http://wiki.lerner.co.il)
into my Web browser. And, sure enough, I'm greeted by MediaWiki's
initial page, which tells me that the software has been installed
successfully and points me to two pages, one for customizing the
interface and another describing usage and configuration.

Basic Navigation and Editing</h2></div></div><p>
If you have ever used Wikipedia, navigating through a MediaWiki
site will be extremely familiar to you. If not, the basic rules are
as follows: clicking on a link within a page brings you to another
page within the MediaWiki site. The exception is when the link is
followed by an arrow icon, which indicates that the link will open a
site on another server. All pages on the site are not only viewable
by the general public, but they also are editable. If you want to change the
contents of a page, click on the Edit link (at the top of each
MediaWiki screen), modify the contents as you see fit, and then click
on the Save button when you are done.
</p><p>
MediaWiki tries to make it as easy as possible for users to
participate without having to understand the technical side of
things.
It's thus unnecessary for end users to know HTML; they instead
can click on a variety of buttons (and use a simplified formatting system)
to format postings they make to the system. For example, entering
[[Foo]] creates a link to the page Foo, regardless of whether it
already exists. And, entering a link of the form [[Foo | This leads to
Foo]] inserts a link to the Foo page, but with the text &ldquo;This leads
to Foo&rdquo;.
</p><p>
More important than MediaWiki's simple markup language is the fact
that every change made to the system is kept in an easy-to-use
version-control system. By clicking on the History link on a given
page, even a nontechnical user can view previous versions of a page,
see who has made a given change or compare two versions of a
particular document. In addition, users can set up watch lists,
such that the user receives an e-mail message every time a page is
modified. This allows users with particular interests and expertise
to keep up with the latest updates to a given page and to monitor the
content for potential damage.
</p><p>
By default, the left side of every page contains a short menu of
commonly accessed links, including the main page (home page) of
the wiki, a list of recent changes, a random existing page and the
documentation. There is also a search box on the left side. Entering
a text string and clicking on the Search button brings up a list of
documents whose titles and/or contents match the target string.
Because MediaWiki contents are all in the MySQL database, and because
modern versions of MySQL have built-in text-indexing routines, such
searches are relatively speedy.
</p><p>
Each page in a MediaWiki site has a URL that begins with the overall
site URL (in my case, that would be http://wiki.lerner.co.il),
followed by index.php/, and then the title of the page. Page titles
may contain spaces, in which case the URL replaces each space with an
underscore character. The page named Reuven Lerner on my server
would thus have a complete URL of
http://wiki.lerner.co.il/index.php/Reuven_Lerner. Somewhat
frustratingly, MediaWiki URLs are case-sensitive, which means that
entering an incorrectly capitalized word can result in the creation of
a new page. Remember, a wiki never produces a true &ldquo;not
found&rdquo; error,
because you (the visitor) might well be interested in starting that
very page.
</p><p>
There is no hierarchy to pages in a MediaWiki site. There is a single
namespace, which can potentially lead to confusion. To reduce
ambiguity, pages may contain additional information in
parentheses (which are then part of the URL). Or, users can create a
disambiguation page, which contains links to a number of pages with
similar or identical names.
</p><p>
If you want to allow users to upload images, you need to
modify the LocalSettings.php file that should now exist in your
server's DocumentRoot directory. In the version I installed,
line 73 of LocalSettings.php (just beneath a relevant comment in the
PHP code) contains a commented-out definition of $wgEnableUploads,
setting it to true. By uncommenting this line, you allow users to
upload images to the server. These uploads will be, by default, in
the images subdirectory (www/images), whose permissions must
be writable by the Apache process.
</p><p>
Once you have turned on the uploading of images, logged-in users will
be able to upload them with a two-step process. First, they click on
the insert image button when editing a wiki page, or manually insert
tags of the form [[Image:Example.gif]]. (Images all have the Image:
prefix in MediaWiki, but there is a single, flat namespace for images,
as is the case for textual content pages.) Once users have finished
editing the page, they can then click on the missing image
link. This will bring them to an HTML form allowing the missing
image to be uploaded via the user's browser. Other types of documents
can be uploaded in a similar way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fe108"></a>
Special Pages</h2></div></div><p>
Wikis are a specialized form of content-management system (CMS). As
such, they are programs whose goal is to display the most recent
version of a generally static document. This contrasts with many
other server-side programs, whose content changes for each user and
invocation. Of course, MediaWiki must scan each document as it is
published, in order to generate the different URLs needed for the existing
and new links mentioned within the body of the text. But for the most
part, MediaWiki specializes in the easy creation and distribution of
static content, rather than programmatic pages.
</p><p>
However, MediaWiki's authors recognized that they and others
probably will want to create dynamically generated pages, and thus was born
the Special: designation. Any page whose name begins with
Special: is treated&mdash;well, it's treated differently, populating
the document body with the output of a PHP function. In order to
create our own special page, we need to write a PHP function
and then register that function with MediaWiki.
</p><p>
The first step is to create a new MediaWiki extension, putting it in
the extensions directory just under the MediaWiki DocumentRoot.
(The basic MediaWiki distribution includes this directory, but it is
normally empty after a fresh install.) We will create the file
extensions/SpecialHello.php, which looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
$wgExtensionFunctions[] = "wfExtensionSpecialHello";

function wfExtensionSpecialHello()
{
    global $wgMessageCache;
    $wgMessageCache-&gt;addMessages(array('hello' =&gt; 'Hello page'));

    require_once('includes/SpecialPage.php');
    SpecialPage::addPage(new SpecialPage('Hello'));
}

?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The first line appends our function's name (&ldquo;wfExtensionSpecialHello&rdquo;)
to the global array $wgExtensionFunctions, putting this function in
the directory of extensions. Many MediaWiki extensions change the
output from certain tags; in this case, we are looking to create an
entire page, rather than modify the behavior of a tag. Nevertheless,
we are creating an extension.
</p><p>
Next, we define our function. The first thing that we do is modify
$wgMessageCache, such that our extension will look like a special page
rather than a tag-modifying extension. The special page will continue
to work if we fail to include these initial two lines, but its listing
on Special:Specialpages will look odd, with the title coming between &lt;
and &gt; brackets as if it were a tag. Note that the page name must
begin with a lowercase letter in the call to addMessages, even when it
is capitalized in the call to SpecialPage::addPage. Failing to note
this quirk of capitalization will result in strange page titles.
</p><p>
The final two lines import the code specific for special pages, and
then create an instance of such a special page, adding it to the directory.
</p><p>
Just what our special page does depends on another file of the same
name (that is, SpecialHello.php), located in the includes directory
that is parallel to extensions, just under the MediaWiki
DocumentRoot. This directory contains a large number of standard
special pages that come with MediaWiki, including
SpecialNewpages.php, SpecialUserrights.php and
SpecialImagelist.php. These functions can access the back-end MySQL
database, perform calculations and access external sites&mdash;and then
pipe the results back into a standard MediaWiki output page.
</p><p>
Here is a simple version of what we might put into our
includes/SpecialHello.php file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
function wfSpecialHello() {
global $wgOut;
$wgOut-&gt;addHTML('Hello, world');
}
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The above function, which is invoked whenever we go to the
Special:Hello page, adds the HTML &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; to the output.
Notice that we don't have to begin, end or otherwise modify the HTML
file that is sent to the user. Nor do we need to worry about choosing
a skin, setting up menus or other details. However, we do need to
be careful about whitespace, as is often the case with PHP
programs&mdash;failing to trim whitespace before the initial &lt;?php tag might well
produce odd error messages from PHP about modified headers.
</p><p>
Finally, we register our extension and special page in the
LocalSettings.php file, adding the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require_once("extensions/SpecialHello.php");
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have put the above in place, your site should now have a
Special:Hello page, listed as Hello when you visit
Special::Specialpages.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Wikipedia has generated a number of headlines over the last few
months, and its future as a reliable, neutral, volunteer effort
remains to be determined. But Wikipedia has demonstrated the power
that a wiki can bring to an organization looking to collect
information from a wide variety of participants. If your organization
would benefit from a centralized repository created in a decentralized
manner, a wiki might just fit the bill.
</p><p>
And, although MediaWiki is far from the only available package, it is
highly polished, reliable and easy for both administrators and
users. Producing new dynamic pages, known as special pages in the
MediaWiki world, requires a fair amount of knowledge of the underlying
system. But, getting started is not that difficult, and it is
possible (and desirable) to take advantage of the tremendous
infrastructure that MediaWiki brings to the table.
