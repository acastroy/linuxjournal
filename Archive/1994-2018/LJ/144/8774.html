Shuffle off to the next step in creating a shell script
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you've been keeping track of my column, you'll know that we're building a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game as a shell script. Why? Because most shell scripts are far
too boring to study without nodding off, so considering all the nuances of
shell script programming within the context of a game just sounds more fun!
</p><p>
My last column talked about how to shuffle a deck of cards, as portrayed in
a program with a simple array of 52 values, 1-52. There are
some interesting nuances to the shuffle problem. Let's start there.
Then we'll look at how to turn an arbitrary 1-52
value into a familiar rank and suite from a deck of cards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106a608"></a>
The Shuffle Function</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been writing shell scripts since the
dawn of UNIX, you might not
have realized that modern shells now support functions and procedures, just
like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming language. For any block of code that you plan on
executing more than once, it's the way to go.
</p><p>
Here's the shuffle code, written as a shell function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function shuffleDeck
{
   count=1

   while [ $count -le 52 ]
   do
      pickCard
      newdeck[$count]=$picked
      count=$(( $count + 1 ))
   done
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This builds an array called newdeck, which is actually the shuffled deck
(in the last column we showed deck, which was an array of cards in linear
order), and it uses some basic shell math with the $(( )) notation to
save spawning a subshell to invoke expr for each increment of the count
variable.
</p><p>
I said that shell scripts are robust programming environments and that might
be a tiny bit of hyperbole, really. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that the
pickCard function returns its value by setting a global variable,
picked, which isn't really optimal programming strategy. But it works, and
pragmatism is an important part of any good approach to software
development, isn't it?
</p><p>
The full pickCard function is key to making this work, but it is too long
to include here, so grab it from the <i  >LJ</i> FTP site for
your reading pleasure (<a href="ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/8774.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/8774.tgz</a>).
</p><p>
With the shuffleDeck function written and an initializeDeck function,
as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function initializeDeck
{
   card=1 while [ $card -le 52 ] do
      deck[$card]=$card card=$(( $card + 1 ))
   done
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106aa28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
it's easy to do the rudiments of shuffling the deck and dealing out two
cards for the player and two for the dealer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
initializeDeck shuffleDeck

echo "** Player's hand: ${newdeck[1]}, ${newdeck[3]}"
echo "** Dealer's hand: ${newdeck[2]}, ${newdeck[4]}"
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's run this and see what kind of results we get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./blackjack.sh
** Player's hand: 22, 49
** Dealer's hand: 11, 8
$ ./blackjack.sh
** Player's hand: 19, 32
** Dealer's hand: 49, 10
$ ./blackjack.sh
** Player's hand: 44, 23
** Dealer's hand: 46, 11
</pre>
</p><p>
Displaying cards as a numeric value from 1-52 is not the most friendly,
so let's turn our attention to the display of the card values in the
familiar rank and suite of a traditional deck of playing cards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106ac90"></a>
Math Games to Identify Rank and Suite</h2></div></div><p>
A deck of cards is composed of 52 cards, split evenly into four suites of
13 cards. The order of the suites doesn't matter (in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span>, at least),
but the rank does. Indeed, the goal of the game is have a summary rank
value of 21 points without going any higher.
</p><p>
The rank of a card is the remainder of the numeric card value divided
by 13. In math terms, this is called the modulus and can be computed
thusly:
</p><p>
rank = cardvalue % 13
</p><p>
To put this into proper shell notation, we'll again use the $(( ))
shortcuts and end up with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rank=$(( $card % 13 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Getting the suite should be simple too; it's the other half of the
division. In other words, if the card value is 17, then 17/13 = 1,
meaning it's suite #1, and 17%13 = 4. Since we'd like to have our suites
in the range of 1-4, rather than 0-3, however, we'll need to add one
to the equation. Further, the 13th of each card is the same suite as
the earlier 12, so we'll also have to subtract one before we do the
division (card #13 would be suite #1 if we just calculated 13/13, but
if we calculate 12/13 for that, we'll correctly identify it as part of
suite #0).
</p><p>
This is very confusing, so here's the equation instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
suite="$(( ( ( $card - 1) / 13 ) + 1))"
</pre>
</p><p>
Much clearer, right? Seriously, you can experimentally verify that
this works correctly. The important edge cases are value=1, value=12,
value=13 and value=14. If you can get those right, you're good for all
values in the deck.
</p><p>
Once we've identified the rank and suite of a card, we just have to do
a bit of fancy footwork to turn numbers into words:

<pre     class="programlisting">
case $suite in
 1 ) suite="Hearts"  ;;
 2 ) suite="Clubs"    ;;
 3 ) suite="Spades"  ;;
 4 ) suite="Diamonds" ;;
 * ) echo "Bad suite value: $suite"; exit 1
esac
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">
case $rank in
 0 ) rank="King"    ;;
 1 ) rank="Ace"     ;;
 11) rank="Jack"    ;;
 12) rank="Queen"  ;;
esac
</pre>
</p><p>
Put these together in a function called showCard (which returns
&ldquo;$cardname&rdquo; as the calculated rank and suite), and we can now clean up
a bit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
initializeDeck shuffleDeck

echo -n "** Player's hand: "
  showCard ${newdeck[1]} ; echo -n "$cardname, "
  showCard ${newdeck[3]} ; echo "$cardname"

echo -n "** Dealer's hand: "
  showCard ${newdeck[2]} ; echo -n "$cardname, "
  showCard ${newdeck[4]} ; echo "$cardname"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we can start to see the game come together! Consider:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./blackjack.sh
** Player's hand: 8 of Clubs, 3 of Diamonds
** Dealer's hand: King of Spades, 3 of Spades
$ ./blackjack.sh
** Player's hand: 2 of Spades, 4 of Spades
** Dealer's hand: 10 of Spades, 4 of Hearts
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's stop here this month as that's a lot of code to dig through
already. I invite you to pop over to the <i  >LJ</i> FTP site
to grab all the source code so far, so you can experiment with this
script yourself too.
</p><p>
Next month, we'll start looking at the game logic itself, but for now,
Vegas beckons for a big tradeshow and, well, I can write it off as
research for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, can't I?
