If you don't get a buzz off the wine, you will surely get high on these
podcast download tools.

Relax, Fran&ccedil;ois! I wasn't trying to scare you. I pulled your earphones
out because it is nearly time for our guests to arrive, and I couldn't
seem to get your attention any other way. What were you listening to
anyhow? The <span   class="emphasis"><em>New Scientist</em></span> podcast? Very nice, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. I did not
realize that you were fascinated by science stories. I must admit, that
particular podcast is one of my favorites as well. I regularly download
several programs including that one. Sometimes I listen to them on the
Linux system where I have downloaded them. Other times, I copy
them to my handheld and take them on the road. Podcasts are a great
diversion on trains or while sitting in waiting rooms. Best of all,
there are tons of great programs out there, from pros and amateurs alike
with topics covering pretty much anything you can think of.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> It takes a while, you say? You don't really manually
download all your podcasts, do you? Right-click and Save As off the Web
page? Really, Fran&ccedil;ois, there are much better ways to do this. Luckily,
those helpful programs are the subject of tonight's menu. But for
now, I see that our guests have arrived and we must attend to them
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home of
fine wine, delectable Linux fare and, of course, the most excellent
clientele. Please, allow me to help you to your tables. Make yourselves
comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, to the wine cellar! Head to the north wing and
bring back the 2002 New Zealand Pinot Noir, the Marlborough, please.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois and I were just discussing podcasts and the need for some
way to download and collect them effectively. Chasing down podcasts,
looking for new programs and downloading them can take a frightful
amount of time. That's why podcast aggregators are such a great idea
and why so many clients exist. Some graphical clients are rich and
complex, like the wine&mdash;we'll look at one shortly. Others are
much simpler. One of the simplest podcast aggregators I've seen,
Linc Fessenden's BashPodder, is nothing more than a bash shell
script and a tiny one at that. Head over to the BashPodder Web site (see
the on-line Resources), and download the bashpodder.shell script and the
parse_enclosure.xsl file. When you get the two, copy them into
the folder of your choice. Then, have a look at the script. At less than
1K, you won't believe how simple it is.
</p><p>
Excellent, Fran&ccedil;ois. That was very fast. Please pour for our
guests. Enjoy, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.
</p><p>
A sample configuration file, bp.conf, is also available for
download from the BashPodder site. The sample file includes some of Linc's
favorite podcast feeds, so feel free to download it if you are curious
as to his tastes, but the format is simple enough that you won't need
it. bp.conf is simply a collection of feed links. For instance,
here's a file with three feeds, one for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New
Scientist</em></span> podcast,
Brian Ibbott's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coverville</em></span> and the BBC's excellent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>In Our Time</em></span>.


<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.newscientist.com/podcastfeed.ns
http://www.coverville.com/index.xml
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3/podcast.xml
</pre>
</p><p>
I store this file in the same directory from which I run the
bashpodder.shell script file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sh bashpodder.shell
</pre>
</p><p>
The script creates a folder with the date of the run as its name (for
example,
2006-01-04). BashPodder runs silently and downloads all of the current
podcasts to that folder. Set the program to run in a cron job, and you
will always be right up to date. Be warned, however, that BashPodder will
download all of the current downloads for the particular feed. There's
no picking and choosing.
</p><p>
Eskild Hustvedt's GoldenPod is also a command-line driven program
that is simple to use and easy to set up in a cron job for unattended
downloads. This one uses Perl instead of bash and adds some useful
features that aren't present in the much simpler BashPodder. GoldenPod
can run silently (with the -s command switch), but it also
can report on its progress as it works. You can elect to download only
the most recent podcast in a series rather than the entire collection
(which can sometimes be huge). GoldenPod also can list available
podcasts without downloading, copy files to a portable player, clean
up old podcasts and provide statistics on how much space your podcasts
are taking up. All this for less than 32K.
</p><p>
Get your copy of GoldenPod from the Web site (see Resources)
and extract
the tarball into the directory of your choice. If you simply run
<tt  >./goldenpod</tt> from the folder in which you extracted it, the
program will report that your podcast list is empty, but it also
will create two new directories for you in your home folder. The first
is called .goldenpod, which contains your configuration
files and podcast list. The second is called Podcasts, and this is where your podcasts will be downloaded. In the
~/.goldenpod folder, there are two files: goldenpod.conf
and podcasts.conf. The format of the podcasts.conf
file&mdash;a text file that you can edit using your favorite
editor&mdash;is the same as BashPodder's bp.conf file, essentially a list
of podcast feed addresses.
</p><p>
Once you have added feeds, simply run the program again to start the
download. You may want to try <tt  >goldenpod --dry-run</tt> to see what
you are in for or <tt  >goldenpod -f</tt> to download only the latest. You
then can see the progress of your downloads on your terminal (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8796f1.large.jpg"><img src="8796f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. GoldenPod is a simple, command-line driven podcast aggregator.
</p></div></div><p>
When the download is done, you'll find m3u playlist files
in each of the podcast directories corresponding to your feeds (for example,
~/Podcasts/catalog/showname/showname.m3u). Sure, it's all command
line, but once again, this is a great program to run in a cron job,
quietly in the background, perhaps while you sleep. From time to time,
it is also a good idea to run the program with the --stats option
to see how many programs you have and how much space they are taking up.
</p><p>
Of course, there are graphical podcast aggregators for Linux as well, which, by their nature, expand upon the feature sets of the two I've
mentioned. The perfect podcast aggregator would, for starters, contain
its own directory of podcasts, categorized into an easy-to-search list
of topics. Complement that with an easy one-button system to add feeds, a new
show scanning feature so you don't have to go looking for the latest
shows and a system of automatic scheduled downloads running in the
background, and you've got the makings of a great program. As it turns
out, Scott Grayban's CastPodder does all those things. Your
first step toward podcast Nirvana is to head over to the CastPodder
Web site (see Resources) and download a copy of the latest
program. There, you'll find packages for Mandriva and Debian, as well as
tarred and gzipped source packages.
</p><p>
When you start CastPodder for the first time (command name:
<tt  >CastPodder</tt>), it creates a folder and subfolder called
iPodderData/downloads in your home directory. You can override
this default by selecting Preferences from the File menu. The CastPodder
interface itself has the usual menu bar running along the top offering
access to all the program's features. There are four main tabs labeled
Downloads, Subscriptions, Podcast Directory and Cleanup. If it isn't
already selected when you start, click the Podcast Directory tab, and you'll
see a list of folders describing various directories and top podcast
collections available. Before you go hunting for interesting shows,
click the Refresh icon on the far left of the icon bar. That's
the best way to make sure you are working from a recent list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8796f2.large.jpg"><img src="8796f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. No need to go hunting through podcast directories&mdash;CastPodder
provides its own extensive list.
</p></div></div><p>
Now, let's get back to those podcast directories. Perhaps the most
interesting here is the iPodder.org : Podcasting Central folder, because
it contains the massive list of podcasts from iPodder.org. Click the
small arrow next to the folder to list the categories, subcategories
and, finally, all the various podcasts that correspond to that category. To
subscribe to a podcast, click the title and then click the Add button. If
the podcast you want isn't listed here, you can add it manually by
clicking Tools on the menu bar and selecting Add a Feed. As you
subscribe to various podcasts, subdirectories with the names of those
podcasts will be created in ~/iPodderdata/downloads. For
instance, I have folders called Coverville, New Scientist Podcast
and Quirks and Quarks from CBC Radio among others. Each folder holds
that particular show's podcasts, so make sure you have a lot of disk space.
</p><p>
Let's go back to the Subscriptions tab (Figure 3). A list of all the
podcasts to which you have subscribed is in the top half of the main
window. Click any of these shows, and the bottom pane lists the various
episodes, the size of the show and its location on the Web. Look to the
far left next to the episode title, and you'll see a check box. Click this
box to flag the episode for download. If there is a little green arrow
next to the episode title, that means it already has been downloaded to
your Linux system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8796f3.large.jpg"><img src="8796f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Subscription lists allow you to select episodes
individually for download.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have selected the episodes you want, click the first button
on the left of the icon bar, the one that says Scan for new Feeds
when you pause your mouse cursor over it. The button will turn gray, and
the download of your podcasts will begin. To see the progress of those
downloads, click on the Downloads tab. You'll see the current state of the
download, as well as the speed and percentage completed of the transfer
(Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8796f4.large.jpg"><img src="8796f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Downloads tab tells you the progress of each podcast download.
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, we get to the whole point of finding and downloading all these
shows, and that's listening to them. Take a look again at that little
green arrow to the left of your downloaded episodes (this applies to
both the Download and the Subscriptions tab). Either double-click the
entry or right-click and select Play episode in media player from the
pop-up menu. By default, XMMS will start to play the program you've
chosen (Figure 5). It's possible to override this choice of player,
but your choices are limited to XMMS, the Beep Media Player and no
player at all. To make the change, click File on the menu bar and select
Preferences. Then, in the Preferences window, click on the Player tab.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8796f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. By default, CastPodder launches XMMS to play your podcasts.
</p></div></div><p>
CastPodder swallows down into a nice, lemony applet in your system tray
so that the program can keep running out of the way. This is particularly
handy when you consider CastPodder's scheduling functionality. From the
Subscriptions tab, click the Scheduler button on the icon bar to automate
your podcast downloads. Automatic updates and downloads to subscribed
feeds can be set to run at a specific time of day or at regular intervals
throughout the course of the day. That way, you don't have to spend time
checking up on new episodes. Just let CastPodder do the work for you.
</p><p>
It appears, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that closing time is almost upon us. Still,
I should mention one final CastPodder feature before I finish and that
has to do with cleaning up. Earlier on, I mentioned that it is good to
have lots of free space if you get into the habit of downloading several
podcasts. It is also a good idea to clean up those old shows as new
ones continue to be downloaded. Click the Cleanup tab and CastPodder
lets you select individual episodes by the podcast feed name and easily
delete them. It is also possible to select them all with a single click
should you want every episode deleted.
</p><p>
It is now closing time, but I see that many of you are in the middle
of searching for and subscribing to many interesting programs in the
podcastverse. Take a little more time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. I'm sure that
Fran&ccedil;ois will be more than happy to refill your glasses one final time
before before we say, &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Au revoir</em></span>&rdquo;.
Hmm...perhaps one of you can
check to see if there are any podcasts dedicated to wine. On that note,
please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
