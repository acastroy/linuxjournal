How to create a useful new Web service by tapping in to the power of two
other freely available Web services.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27aa580.0x28a22f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we looked at the latest incarnation of Web services
offered by on-line giant Amazon. Amazon was one of the first companies
to embrace Web services, and although some of its newer offerings
require payments on a monthly or per-query basis, basic catalog
searches are still available free of charge.
</p><p>
If we think of each individual Web service as a function call, we
can think of a collection of Web services, such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS), as a software
library. And although we can certainly create interesting applications
with such libraries, it is often useful to create new libraries that
sit on top of the existing ones. In many ways, the history of
software is the history of creating increasingly powerful abstractions
by stacking libraries on top of one another. Outside of the
classroom, most of us haven't ever had to implement a sort algorithm
or create a buffered I/O library, simply because such things have been
written and optimized by previous generations of programmers.
</p><p>
I thus believe that it's useful for us to consider AWS not as a set of
routines that we can incorporate into end-user programs, but rather
as a set of low-level libraries on top of which we can (and should)
create new libraries appropriate for our specific needs.
</p><p>
This month, we look at a simple example of what I mean. The
project will reflect my love of books. The Internet has made it
difficult for me to stop buying used books, because so many are
available at low prices. But, I'm fortunate to be spending several
years in Skokie, Illinois, which has an excellent public library.
Skokie's library has not only an extensive collection, but it also has a
Web-based interface to the book catalog. Our project for this month,
thus, is to create a Web service that integrates Amazon's catalog
with the information from the Skokie public library. In other words,
we're going to write a Web service that itself relies upon another Web
service. The input to our service will be an International Standard Book Number (ISBN); the output will be
an indication of the book's availability and price at Amazon and the
Skokie library.
</p><p>
In some ways, this Web service will duplicate the excellent Book
Burro plugin for the Firefox Web browser, which I often use to find
the best bargains. And indeed, Book Burro looks at both bookstores
and public libraries in order to find books. I recommend Book Burro
to everyone who uses Firefox. But, I believe that building your own
simple Web service, even if it duplicates the functionality of another
program, is a worthwhile endeavor.
</p><p>
Moreover, Web services have the advantage of being available from any
programming language and any application. I can implement my Web
service using Ruby, and people will still be able to access it from
Java, Python, Perl or virtually any other language. In many ways,
this achieves what object broker middleware services like CORBA had
promised, only without the baggage that made CORBA a more complex (but
arguably more secure and rich) programming platform. It makes a Web
service more powerful than a simple software library, because it can be accessed from any platform or language, so long as the
requesting computer is connected to the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27aa580.0x28a25b0"></a>
Searching the Catalog</h2></div></div><p>
In order to integrate an ISBN search for the Skokie library, we're
going to need a way to query the library for information about
book availability. Unfortunately, my library doesn't have a Web
services API for querying its database. But, it does have the
next-best thing, namely a simple Web interface that we can query.
</p><p>
There are several ways to look through the output from a Web page.
Because many sites now use HTML that can be parsed as if it were XML,
we might want to use an XML-parsing library to read through the
response from the library's Web site, looking for particular text in
specific places.
</p><p>
Much as I might like the idea of such an approach, I'm probably not
the only Web developer who takes a more practical, quick-and-dirty
look. I have used my library's Web site enough times to know that
there is a limited number of responses it might send back to me.
As a result, I'll use the reliable, if somewhat stupid, approach of
looking for particular cues in the HTTP response.
</p><p>
Our program (skokie-lookup.rb, Listing 1) is written in Ruby, a
language I have grown to enjoy more and more over the past few
months. We begin by importing the included Net::HTTP module, which
defines classes and methods that provide HTTP-based communication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27aa580.0x28a27c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. skokie-lookup.rb
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/ruby

require 'net/http'

if ARGV.length == 0
  puts "#{$0}: You must enter at least one argument."

# Set up our regular expressions
not_in_collection_re = /class="yourEntryWouldBeHereData"/ix
on_shelf_re = /CHECK SHELF/ix
checked_out_re = /DUE /ix

# Iterate through each of our arguments
ARGV.each do |isbn|

  # Ignore non-ISBN arguments
  if not isbn.match(/[0-9xX]{10}/)
    output &lt;&lt; "ISBN #{isbn} is invalid.\n"
    next
  end

  # Ask the library what it knows about our ISBN
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response('catalog.skokie.lib.il.us',
                                    "/search~S4/i?SEARCH=#{isbn}")

  # Check our regular expressions against the HTML response
  if not_in_collection_re.match(response.body)
    output &lt;&lt; "ISBN #{isbn} is not in the Skokie collection.\n"
  elsif on_shelf_re.match(response.body)
    output &lt;&lt; "ISBN #{isbn} is on the shelf.\n"
  elsif checked_out_re.match(response.body)
    output &lt;&lt; "ISBN #{isbn} is currently checked out.\n"
  else
    output &lt;&lt; "ISBN #{isbn} response: Unparseable!\n"
  end
end

# Show everyone what we've learned
puts output

</pre></div><p>
We then check to make sure that we have at least one command-line
argument, by looking at the built-in ARGV array. If the length of
ARGV is 0, we know we weren't passed any arguments, and
we should give the user a brief indication of how the program should
be used.
</p><p>
Then, we set up a number of variables that will be needed later on.
The output variable is a string to which we will add any output we
need to send to the user. We also create three Regexp (regular
expression) objects, which we will use in our loop.
</p><p>
Next comes the meat of the program. We iterate over each element of
ARGV, first checking that it is a ten-character ISBN containing only
numbers and the letter X. We then query the Skokie library's Web site
for that ISBN, passing Net::HTTP.get_response the hostname and path to
the program we want. The HTTP response, including its headers and
body, is then available in our response variable.
</p><p>
Now we compare the response body against our three regular
expressions, checking which it matches. Using Ruby's &lt;&lt; operator for
concatenation, we add an appropriate message to the output variable
for each ISBN. Finally, just before the program exits, it gives a
full report of ISBNs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27aa580.0x28a2ad8"></a>
Combining the Search Results</h2></div></div><p>
The above program works just fine, and it provides an easier way to query
the Skokie library catalog than the standard Web pages. But, I'm
interested in knowing how much the book would cost if I were to buy it
from Amazon, as well as whether it's available from the library. With
all of this information, I can then decide if I want to buy the book,
check it out of the library or neither.
</p><p>
Last month, we saw how we could use a REST-style request (that is, HTTP
GET with arguments) to retrieve information from Amazon. Now we
will write a program that performs that retrieval and then pulls out
the relevant XML data.
</p><p>
As you might remember, we can retrieve Web services information from
Amazon by sending an HTTP request to webservices.amazon.com, asking
for the document /onca/xml, and then specifying the Service,
Operation and AWSAccessKeyId name-value pairs. If we are
interested in learning about new and used prices for that ISBN, we
then pass the ItemId parameter, and indicate that we want the
ResponseGroup known as OfferSummary.
</p><p>
Because Amazon returns XML in all of its responses, including those
invoked with REST, we can parse through the XML to find the
lowest prices for our book. Ruby comes with the REXML-parsing
library, which works with XML in a number of different ways; we will
use it to scan through Amazon's response for the appropriate code.
</p><p>
Finally, we can rework our existing code, such that it will
search the Skokie library for the ISBN and produce a textual
summary. Listing 2 contains a program (combined-lookup.rb) that
produces such combined output.

combined-lookup.rb begins in almost the same way as skokie-lookup.rb, although
it imports the rexml/document module along with the net/http
module. It then iterates through ISBNs that were passed on the
command line, ignoring those that don't fit the strict definition.
</p><p>
The main addition to this program begins with the creation of a string
named amazon_params. In theory, we could have built this string in a
number of different ways, many of them less complicated than the
combination of methods I chose. But, I felt that using a hash in
this way would make it easier to modify the code later on, even if it
requires a bit more time to understand at first.
</p><p>
The basic idea is as follows: we create a hash, in which the keys are
the AWS REST parameter names, and the values are the corresponding
parameter values. In order to get these parameters into the standard
format of param1=value1&amp;param2=value2, we use map to create an array
from the keys and values of the hash. Our array will contain strings,
each of which is in the param=value format, joined together with an
equal sign. Finally, we use join to combine all of those pairs
with &amp; signs between them, producing a string that we assign to
amazon_params.
</p><p>
With our parameters in place, we use Net::HTTP.get_response, just as
we did before in skokie-lookup.rb. The hostname will be different,
and the requested URL on that host will also be quite different,
incorporating the parameters that we just assigned to amazon_params.
But, the request is sent in the same way, and we retrieve the response
in the same way as well.
</p><p>
However, whereas the Skokie library sends its response in HTML, Amazon
replies using XML. So, we fire up REXML, creating a new instance of
REXML::Document with the contents of the Amazon response. We then use
the elements method on the response's root node to find the lowest
new, used and collectible prices. (Amazon provides each of these
prices separately, which I admit is a bit annoying.) If the text
within that node is nil, no such price exists, and we indicate
that to the user. Otherwise, we can assume we got a price back&mdash;and
a price formatted with a dollar sign and decimal point, at that&mdash;and we display it for the user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27aa580.0x28a30b0"></a>
Creating a Web Service</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have created a combined lookup tool, how can we turn it
into a Web service? (For the purposes of simplicity, I'm going to use
XML-RPC. It would be equally valid to use SOAP or even to look for
REST parameters.)
</p><p>
The answer is easier than you might think. We will need to modify the
program to take its inputs from the Web instead of ARGV. We
also will need to send the output over the XML-RPC, back to the client that
sent the original request.
</p><p>
But the end result, as you can see in Listing 3, is not terribly
different from what we had in Listing 2. And because it operates as a
Web service, we can now incorporate its results into new programs that
we might write. Better yet, we can create new Web services that
use this service as an underlying foundation, thus stacking the
functions even deeper, into even more useful libraries.

</pre></div><p>
Listing 3 begins by creating a new instance of XMLRPC::Server on port
8080. It then adds a new handler, which we call atf.books, and
which both accepts an array as input and returns one as output. Using
Ruby's block notation, the handler then iterates over each ISBN that
it receives via the XML-RPC method call.
</p><p>
The rest of the program is largely the same as combined-lookup.rb,
with the exception of the output. Output to an XML-RPC method call,
at least in this Ruby library, is accomplished by placing the output
in the final line of the block. Because we plan to return an array, we
need to create and populate the array. We thus define
output variable as an empty array and add one element to it for
each ISBN we check. Each element of that array then will be a hash
(known as a struct in XML-RPC jargon), with the ISBN key pointing
to the book's ISBN, and the New, Used and Collectible keys
pointing to the prices retrieved from Amazon.
</p><p>
The server program then concludes with a call to server.serve,
starting an infinite listener loop for a simple HTTP server.
</p><p>
To test this program, you need an RPC client; a simple one is shown in
Listing 4 and takes its arguments from the command line. You'll
notice that we use Ruby's exception-handling mechanism to watch for
potential problems. If there is an error on the server, we can trap it
and print a useful debugging message.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Seasoned programmers rarely implement everything themselves. The days
in which every application needed its own video and printer drivers,
to say nothing of a filesystem or operating system, are long behind
us. Instead, we now have hierarchies of software libraries, with each
library making use of lower-level data and functions and also
performing similar tasks for higher-level libraries.
</p><p>
Web services haven't changed the need for building new libraries on
top of old ones. Indeed, we can expect to see an explosion of such
new libraries in the future. The difference is that new libraries
will often be based on Web services, which provide platform and
language independence. We will see basic, middleware and
high-level Web services, available from anywhere on the Internet and
callable from any operating system or language. This month, we looked
at one way in which we can create a new Web service out of an old one.
Each call to our xmlrpc-lookup server fired off a query to Amazon's
Web services. Information from Amazon was then combined with another
data set, with results that are useful to anyone living in Skokie,
Illinois. We can expect to see similar aggregating Web services in
the future, both free of charge and for pay.
