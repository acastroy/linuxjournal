No more reasons to handle certificates manually&mdash;make your
server do your work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd6580.0x1ece1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
HTTPS is a small island of security in this insecure world, and in this day
and age, there is absolutely no reason not to have it on every Web site you
host. Up until last year, there was just a single last excuse: purchasing
certificates was kind of pricey. That probably was not a big deal for
enterprises; however, if you routinely host a dozen Web sites, each
with multiple subdomains, and have to pay for each certificate
out of your own dear pocket&mdash;well, that quickly could become a burden.
</p><p>
Now you have no more excuses. Enter Let's Encrypt (<a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_self">https://letsencrypt.org</a>), a free Certificate Authority
that officially left Beta status in April 2016.
</p><p>
Aside from being totally free, there is another special thing about Let's
Encrypt certificates: they don't last long. Currently all certificates
issued by Let's Encrypt are valid for only 90 days, and you should expect
that someday this term will become even shorter (<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html" target="_self">https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html</a>). Although this short
lifespan definitely creates a much higher level of security, many people
consider it as an inconvenience, and I've seen people going back from
using Let's Encrypt to buying certificates from commercial certificate
authorities for this very reason.
</p><p>
Of course, if you are running multiple Web sites, having to renew
several certificates manually every three months quickly could become
annoying to say the least. Some
day you even may forget (and you will regret that forgetfulness). Let's leave
routines to computers, right?
</p><p>
If you are using Apache under a Debian-based distribution, Let's Encrypt
already has you covered with the libaugeas0 package, and it is
capable of both issuing and renewing certificates. If, like me, you
prefer nginx and want to have zero-downtime automatic certificate updates
with industrial-grade encryption, keep reading. I'm going to show you how to get
there.
</p><p>
First things first&mdash;some assumptions and requirements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
You are running the nginx (<a href="https://www.nginx.com" target="_self">https://www.nginx.com</a>) Web server/load balancer, and you are going
to use it for TLS termination (that's a fancy, but technically correct way
of saying &ldquo;nginx will handle all this HTTPS stuff&rdquo;).
</p></li><li><p>
nginx serves several Web sites, and you want HTTPS on all of them, and
you are not going to pay a single dime.
</p></li><li><p>
You also want to get the highest grade on the industry standard for SSL
tests&mdash;SSL Lab's SSL server test (<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest" target="_self">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
You do not enjoy the idea of running some not-so-well-sandboxed
third-party code on your server, and you would rather have this code in a
Docker container.
</p></li><li><p>
Naturally, you are lazy (or experienced) enough, so you want to write
some scripts that will re-issue all certificates way before they expire.
</p></li><li><p>
I tested this code on Debian Jessie running nginx 1.6.2 and Docker
1.9.1; it also should work on all other flavors. If you do not have
docker-engine installed, follow the instructions here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation" target="_self">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation</a>.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Now, check whether your nginx supports TLS:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo nginx -V
</pre>
</p><p>
Usually it is supported by default and should yield the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TLS SNI support enabled
</pre>
</p><p>
You also need a place to store certificates:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mkdir -m 755 /etc/letsencrypt
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't sweat the permissions for this directory; the certificates themselves
will not be publicly accessible. Now you need to make a small change in
your nginx configuration. Create a new file /etc/nginx/letsencrypt.inc with
the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    root /tmp/letsencrypt/www;
    break;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Then find your &ldquo;server&rdquo; section in the nginx configuration, and add the
following line to each Web site you host:

<pre     class="programlisting">
include /etc/nginx/letsencrypt.inc;
</pre>
</p><p>
So the final result will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    ...
        include /etc/nginx/letsencrypt.inc;
        ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
After saving both files, ask nginx to reload the configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -t &amp;&amp; sudo service nginx reload

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you are only reloading the nginx configuration&mdash;and nginx 
knows very well how to do it without dropping connections.
</p><p>
Now, let's go get some certificates! Needless to say, all domain names
for which you are going to issue certificates should resolve to your server
IP address; otherwise, it would be possible to issue certificates for
somebody else's domain and use those certificates for man-in-the-middle
attacks.
</p><p>
The following will pull and start a new Docker image with the official Let's Encrypt
client:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /tmp/letsencrypt/www

# make sure you have the latest version of this image,
# and not some pre-beta - those used to be notoriously buggy
docker pull quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest

docker run --rm -it --name letsencrypt \
-v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \                                                                                                                   
-v /tmp/letsencrypt/www:/var/www \
    quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest \
    auth --authenticator webroot \
    --webroot-path /var/www \
    --domain=example.com --domain=www.example.com \
    --email=admin@example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, you share two data volumes between the host and the
container:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/etc/letsencrypt for storing Let's Encrypt configuration, all
certificates and chains.
</p></li><li><p>
/tmp/letsencrypt/www for communication between your server with Let's
Encrypt servers. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The webroot plugin that runs inside the container will
create a temporary challenge file for each of your domains, then Let's
Encrypt validation servers will send an HTTP request to ensure that you are
really controlling this domain and this server. These files are temporary
and needed only during issuing or renewing a certificate.
</p><p>
You will need to agree on TOS by pressing a button, and after several
seconds, your certificate is ready. If you have several subdomains, as in
this example, you can enumerate all of them, which will result in one
shared certificate issued for all of these subdomains. However, if you have
several domains, it would be much more convenient to have a separate
certificate for each of them&mdash;just repeat this last <tt  >docker
run ...</tt>
command for each domain you have (and thank me later if someday you 
decide to move one of your domains to a different server).
</p><p>
As you can see, the procedure for obtaining certificates is painless and
safe. Almost all the heavy work is done for you behind the scenes, and if
you've ever had to deal with certificates using some other traditional certification
authority, you will know exactly what I mean. Whatever runs inside the
container can access only two directories on the server, and only while it
runs. 
</p><p>
After you get all the certificates, it's safe to remove the temporary
directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -rf /tmp/letsencrypt
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's go back to the nginx configuration. Getting an A+ grade from SSLLabs
requires some additional effort. Create a new Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman prime (if this
is the first time you've see this term, see <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Diffie_Hellman" target="_self">https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Diffie_Hellman</a> for more
information):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/pki/tls/private/dhparam.pem 4096
</pre>
</p><p>
Caution: if you absolutely need to support ancient versions of
client software, for example, Java 6 clients, you need to skip this step and
comment the <tt  >ssl_dhparam</tt> line in the following step. These old
clients do not support Diffie-Hellman parameters longer than 1024 bytes, so
you need to make a choice between supporting those clients and security.
</p><p>
Now, have a hot beverage; it will take some time to generate. Add these
lines to the &ldquo;http&rdquo; section of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http {
        ...
        ssl_dhparam /etc/pki/tls/private/dhparam.pem;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_timeout 60m;
        ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Create a new file /etc/nginx/ssl_options.inc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssl on;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers "ECDH+AESGCM DH+AESGCM ECDH+AES256 DH+AES256
     &#8618;ECDH+AES128 DH+AES ECDH+3DES DH+3DES RSA+AESGCM 
     &#8618;RSA+AES RSA+3DES !aNULL !MD5 !DSS";
# Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) for half a year
add_header Strict-Transport-Security 
 &#8618;"max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains";
</pre>
</p><p>
And create a new &ldquo;server&rdquo; section:


<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    include /etc/nginx/letsencrypt.inc;
include /etc/nginx/ssl_options.inc;

ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

        # enable OCSP stapling to speed up first connect
    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;
    ssl_trusted_certificate 
     &#8618;/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;

...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Warning: the Strict-Transport-Security header will tell each visitor
that you promise always to use HTTPS in the future. It's a one-way street,
and once you set it, there is no way back&mdash;your visitor's browser will
remember your promise and insist on having HTTPS. Also note: for more information
on OCSP stapling, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling</a>.
</p><p>
After making all of these changes, reload the nginx configuration again:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -t &amp;&amp; sudo service nginx reload

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, your Web site should have HTTPS up and running. Try to open
https://www.example.com/ in a browser and enjoy the green lock sign in the address
line. To verify the quality of encryption, go to <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest" target="_self">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest</a>, and submit your hostname
for a check (usually it takes several minutes). 
</p><p>
So, now that you have HTTPS, how about disabling HTTP? Go back to the HTTP
&ldquo;server&rdquo;
section and make the following improvement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
        include /etc/nginx/letsencrypt.inc;
        ...
if ($scheme = "http") {
        rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://$host/$1 permanent;
}
        ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This will redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS, automatically bringing
all clients to the secure version of your Web site. Reload the nginx configuration
to activate the changes. 
</p><p>
Now it's time to automate certificate renewals. Let's Encrypt's current
policy allows you to request five certificate renewals for a domain within
seven
days. That means it wouldn't be wise (and wouldn't make much sense either)
to try to renew certificates every day. On the other hand, leaving it for the
last moment before expiration also is quite dangerous. Luckily, there is an
easy way to renew these certificates only when they have less than 30 days
before expiration. To me, 30 days sounds just right. That means my
certificates will be reissued every 60 days on average, and if something
fails afterward, I will have a whole month to fix
whatever is broken.
</p><p>
Create a script for renewal (I placed it in/root/update_keys.sh) with these
contents:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p /tmp/letsencrypt/www

ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

OUTPUT="$((docker run --rm -i --name letsencrypt \
    -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
    -v /tmp/letsencrypt/www:/var/www \
    quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest renew) 2&gt;&amp;1)"

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "${OUTPUT}" | grep -q "No renewals were attempted"
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        # all certificates have more than 30 days left - 
        # nothing to do
        exit 0
    fi
    echo "${OUTPUT}" | tr -Cd '[:print:]\n' \
        | mail -s "${HOSTNAME}: Let's Encrypt keys renewal -
         &#8618;success" "${ADMIN_EMAIL}"
    else
        echo "${OUTPUT}" | tr -Cd '[:print:]\n' \
            | mail -s "${HOSTNAME}: Let's Encrypt keys renewal -
             &#8618;failed, exit code $?!" "${ADMIN_EMAIL}"
        exit 1
    fi

    # test config, reload if successful
    /usr/sbin/nginx -t &amp;&gt; /dev/null 
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo 'please fix configfile problem' \
            | mail -s "${HOSTNAME}: nginx unable to reload"
             &#8618;"${ADMIN_EMAIL}"
        logger "nginx has errors - not reloaded"
    else
        service nginx reload
        logger "nginx reloaded"
    fi

    rm -rf /tmp/letsencrypt
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to assign proper access rights:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo chmod u+x /root/update_keys.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
And create a crontab entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo crontab -e
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd6580.0x22c84f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with a line like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
17 2 * * * /root/update_keys.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
That will trigger execution of this update script at 2:17 every day. The update
script will check whether your certificates have more than 30 days left, and if
they don't, it will attempt to renew all expiring certificates. Are you
wondering why I used 2:17 am? Well, there is a simple explanation for that:
almost everybody else did not. Most people, when creating cron jobs,
use some simple value like 1:00 am, 2:00 am, 3:30 am, 4:15 pm and so on, and that
is a really, really bad choice if your cron job is supposed to talk to an
external service, because that means the service will experience maximum
loads every once in a while. It is bad for the service, and it is not good for
you; the chance of getting a timeout is significantly higher if you send a
request during these peak loads.
</p><p>
So, for this job, please, please do not use an even value, and do not
use my value; use some random value instead, and everything will be
fine.
</p><p>
As you can see, Let's Encrypt managed to make the full automation of
certificate maintenance possible. If you are using it right, it just
works&mdash;and it's free.
