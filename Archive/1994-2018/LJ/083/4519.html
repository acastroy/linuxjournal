    SOAP is something you may find a use for, even if you're not
    intersted in three-tier web applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bff5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the January and February installments
of &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;, I demonstrated a simple three-tier web
application using a database, web server and the Mason templating
system for mod_perl. We were able to see some of the advantages and
disadvantages of a three-tier web application, particularly when
compared with its two-tier counterpart.
</p><p>But as I pointed out last month, our three-tier architecture
was incomplete and wasn't necessarily a fair demonstration. That's
because our Perl middleware object layer had to reside on the same
computer as the components we wrote for HTML::Mason, a templating
system built on mod_perl. Depending on how you count things, this
might be considered a two-tier application, albeit one with an
object-oriented abstraction layer between the tiers.</p><p>In order to put the Mason components and Perl objects on
separate computers, we somehow need the ability to call an object
method across a network. That is, the following line of Perl would
work, regardless of whether $object resides on the same computer as
our Apache server or somewhere else on the Internet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$object-&gt;method($arg1, $arg2);
</pre><p>Distributed-object technology and remote-procedure calls have
existed for many years on a variety of platforms. In almost every
case, this technology was restricted to a particular language or
platform. DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) allows objects
of any language to communicate but only under Windows. Java's RMI
(Remote Method Invocation) can only communicate with other Java
objects. CORBA is an exception to this, allowing objects to
communicate across platforms and languages, but CORBA is complex,
has taken awhile to get off the ground and isn't yet a part of most
programmers' knowledge base.
</p><p>In response to these proprietary and complex protocols, a
number of people in the Internet community have created SOAP, the
Simple Object Access Protocol, that makes it extremely easy to
create distributed applications. Two of the biggest proponents of
SOAP have been Dave Winer (famous for his Scripting News
&ldquo;weblog&rdquo;) and Microsoft, which is not usually associated with
open standards and cross-platform protocols. Regardless of what we
in the Linux community might think, Microsoft has publicly embraced
SOAP, making it a cornerstone of its .NET effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bff870"></a>SOAP History and Concepts</h2></div></div><p>SOAP depends on the idea that any two computers on the
Internet can communicate using HTTP, the protocol that powers the
Web. (Actually, SOAP can be transmitted over nearly any high-level
protocol, including SMTP and POP3, but HTTP is by far the most
common.) It then transmits information using XML, the markup
language that allows us to create tags and document standards. The
server turns the incoming XML into an object method call, and then
turns the object's response into an XML document that is returned
as the HTTP response. Since both HTTP and XML are open standards,
published by the World Wide Web Consortium, they can be (and are)
implemented on a variety of platforms and, thus, interact without
any trouble.</p><p>The predecessor to SOAP, known simply as XML-RPC, provided a
simple mechanism for remote procedure calls (RPC) using data
formatted in XML and transmitted over HTTP. For a variety of
reasons, including the fact that XML-RPC could not handle advanced
data structures, the W3C adopted SOAP.</p><p>A number of languages and platforms continue to support
XML-RPC, and it's possible that some situations might call for its
use because it has a smaller overhead. Practically speaking,
however, the fact that SOAP has gotten so much attention has led to
the development, use and debugging of its libraries to a much
greater extent than those for XML-RPC. As of this writing, however,
there are more implementations of SOAP than XML-RPC, meaning that
your choice of platform or language might force your hand toward
one protocol or the other.</p><p>SOAP, as its name implies, expects to work with objects
rather than simple procedure calls. Thus, SOAP client invokes a
method on a particular object on the server. The method is
specified in the body of the XML document itself, while the object
with which it is associated is named in an HTTP &ldquo;SOAPAction&rdquo;
header. Of course, we also need to specify a computer name and port
to which the SOAP request can be directed.</p><p>The server itself, including its name and the port number on
which the SOAP request is transmitted, is known as the SOAP proxy.
This makes sense when you consider that the HTTP server is simply
relaying an object method invocation and isn't doing any of this
work by itself. Do not confuse the SOAP proxy with an HTTP proxy.
An HTTP proxy relays requests from an HTTP client to an HTTP server
and often performs security checks and caching. A SOAP proxy, by
contrast, relays messages between a SOAP client and an object on
the proxy's computer.</p><p>The object for which the SOAP server acts as a proxy is
sometimes known as the endpoint and is specified in a
&ldquo;SOAPAction&rdquo; HTTP header. The name of the endpoint can be
virtually any text string, including hierarchy separators such as
:: and /. In practice, the endpoint has a direct connection to the
object hierarchy associated with the language in which the SOAP
proxy is written. In Perl, the endpoint might be something like
&ldquo;Foo/Bar&rdquo;, which refers to the Foo::Bar object located in the
file Foo/Bar.pm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bffb30"></a>SOAP Anatomy</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at a simple SOAP conversation. Our examples will
demonstrate SOAP on top of HTTP, which is the most common
configuration. There may be slight differences when working with
other protocols.</p><p>HTTP is stateless, meaning that every connection between two
computers consists of one request (from the client to the server)
and one response (from the server back to the client). The request
and response are each divided into two parts, known as the headers
and the body. Of course, the client and server can add any other
headers they want, opening the door to all sorts of specialized
communications protocols.</p><p>The body of a SOAP request or response will be in XML. (If
you have never worked with XML before, don't worry; while it can be
a deep and intriguing topic, you don't need to know much XML to
work with SOAP.) Each SOAP message&mdash;a request or response&mdash;consists
of an optional SOAP header and a mandatory SOAP body wrapped inside
of a SOAP envelope. The envelope identifies the contents as
belonging to SOAP and sets out the namespaces that will be used for
the rest of the message. The headers describe the data in the body,
and the body contains the method call or its results.</p><p>In order to invoke an object on a remote server via SOAP, we
will have to open an HTTP connection to the appropriate URL,
identifying the object via the SOAPAction header. We send an XML
document containing a SOAP envelope, inside of which our SOAP
headers and body identify the method to be invoked on this object,
as well as any parameters that the method might require. The client
must additionally be prepared to parse the response returned by the
SOAP server, extracting data structures contained in that response
and using them as necessary.</p><p>A SOAP server performs complementary actions, receiving the
SOAP request, parsing its contents and invoking the appropriate
method on the local computer with the passed parameters. The server
also returns the SOAP response to the client, containing one or
more values as necessary.</p><p>Now that you understand the terminology associated with SOAP,
you can forget nearly all of it. SOAP implementations provide us
with an abstraction layer that allows us to ignore the fact that it
communicates via HTTP and that the request and response use XML.
When your program invokes a remote object method using SOAP, it
cares about receiving a response; the way in which the request and
response are packaged is of little concern.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bffdf0"></a>Our Back-End Object</h2></div></div><p>I'm going to write some demonstration programs in Perl using
the excellent SOAP::Lite module written by Paul Kulchenko. This
should give you some idea regarding how to write SOAP clients and
servers, as well as how to integrate them into your web
applications. Despite its name, SOAP::Lite offers a rich array of
functionality and can be a great way to add SOAP functionality to
your Perl programs. Similar SOAP libraries and objects are
available for most major programming languages, so don't think that
SOAP is available only for Perl.</p><p>Because SOAP acts as a proxy for an object, we first have to
create an object whose methods will be available over the network.
Listing 1 contains the simple &ldquo;Text::Caps&rdquo; Perl module, which
handles two fairly useless methods:</p><p><a href="4519l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Caps.pm, the Perl
Module</a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>capitalize</b></span>, which
takes a single string as a parameter and returns the capitalized
version of that string</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>capitalize_array</b></span>,
which does the same thing as capitalize, but to each element in a
list of strings rather than to a single string</p></li></ul></div><p>Notice that while SOAP describes everything in terms of
objects and methods, this sample module uses standard Perl modules
and subroutines rather than object-oriented syntax. So, when I
mention the capitalize method for the Text::Caps object, I really
mean that we'll be invoking the Text::Caps::Capitalize subroutine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1c002c0"></a>A Standalone SOAP Server</h2></div></div><p>SOAP is normally carried over HTTP, which sits on top of
TCP/IP. This means that we can create a simple SOAP server by
taking advantage of the TCP/IP socket code that comes with Perl.
However, SOAP::Lite does much of the dirty work for us; we don't
have to create the socket or wait on it. Rather, we create an
object of type SOAP::Transport::HTTP::D&aelig;mon, which knows how
to act as the appropriate kind of SOAP server. You can see the
source code for such a simple server in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="4519l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Simple Standalone SOAP
Server</a></p><p>The code is relatively simple yet will look odd to even the
most experienced Perl programmers. That's because objects
associated with SOAP::Lite usually return themselves to indicate
success. This allows us to invoke more than one method in a single
call. In other words, we can say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$object-&gt;method1()-&gt;method2();
</pre><p>rather than the traditional
<pre     class="programlisting">
$object-&gt;method1();
$object-&gt;method2();
</pre>


You may choose to work with SOAP::Lite using either syntax, but the
first version is common in documentation.
</p><p>When we invoke the &ldquo;new&rdquo; constructor for
SOAP::Transport::HTTP::D&aelig;mon, we pass it two arguments: the
name of the computer and the port on which the server should listen
for connections.</p><p>Once we have created the server object, we must tell it where
objects are located. This is a security feature, albeit one that
can take some time to understand. Normally, Perl looks for modules
in @INC, an array of directory names. When we import a module, Perl
searches sequentially through each element of @INC until it finds
our module. If it fails to find our module, Perl returns an error
message.</p><p>However, since SOAP exposes our modules to the entire world,
we must be careful before making them available. Perhaps some of
our modules return confidential data or manipulate information in a
relational database. In order to ensure that only those modules we
wish to expose are actually available via SOAP, SOAP::Lite
completely ignores @INC when handling incoming SOAP requests. Only
those modules explicitly mentioned in a call to dispatch_to(), or
in a directory named in dispatch_to(), will be available via
SOAP.</p><p>In a sense, dispatch_to() effectively defines the equivalent
of @INC for incoming SOAP requests. If a module resides in a
directory not mentioned in dispatch_to(), it will be invisible to
SOAP requests. That this is not the same as modifying @INC.</p><p>Note that while I use /tmp for the examples in this article,
it is a poor idea to use /tmp in this way in a real development or
production system. If you want to put SOAP-related Perl modules in
a separate directory from /usr/lib/perl, I strongly suggest that
you keep it on the main file system, such as in
/usr/lib/soaplite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1c00790"></a>Testing Our Server</h2></div></div><p>Now that our standalone SOAP server is running, we should
test it to see if it works. In order to do that, we must create a
SOAP request, send it to the server and then parse through the
XML-encoded SOAP response that it returns. Luckily, SOAP::Lite
includes such a utility, SOAPsh.pl. This small program allows us to
create and send SOAP requests interactively, displaying the
results. SOAPsh.pl alone justifies the download of SOAP::Lite, even
if you are planning to work with another SOAP library for
Perl.</p><p>If we are running our standalone SOAP server on localhost
(i.e., on the same computer as we run SOAPsh.pl), and if we are
running it on port 8080, we can invoke it as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl SOAPsh.pl http://localhost:8080/ Text/Caps
</pre><p>Notice how the first argument to SOAPsh.pl is the URL of the
SOAP server, and the second argument is the object that we want to
invoke. You can avoid a lot of grief by remembering that the second
argument must be passed using a URL-style object hierarchy divider,
namely a slash (/). Typing &ldquo;Text::Caps&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Text/Caps&rdquo;
will confuse the SOAP server and result in hard-to-debug errors.
</p><p>If your invocation of SOAPsh.pl succeeds, you will see the
following prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Usage: method[(parameters)]
&gt;
</pre><p>The &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; sign indicates that it's your turn to type and
you can invoke any method for the object to which you've connected.
You may now call any method that the object supports, including any
parameters. So to capitalize a word, I simply type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; capitalize('abc')
</pre>


Because my SOAP client and server are both on the same computer,
the response is nearly instantaneous. SOAPsh.pl prints out:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--- SOAP RESULT ---
$VAR1 = 'ABC';
</pre>


Hey, that's pretty great! I just invoke an object method across the
network. That wasn't so hard, was it?
</p><p>SOAP would be nice if we could send simple scalars back and
forth. But we can send and receive a variety of data types. For
example, we can invoke capitalize_array, sending a list of
arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; capitalize_array('abc', 'def', &gt;'GHi')
</pre><p>The return value is an array reference:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--- SOAP RESULT ---
$VAR1 = bless( [
                'ABC',
                'DEF',
                'GHI'
                         ], 'Array' );
</pre>


The returned array reference looks a bit funny because it has been
turned into a format that SOAP::Lite can send and retrieve. We will
soon see how our programs can ignore this intermediate format,
seamlessly exchanging complex data structures over the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1c00cb8"></a>Examining the SOAP</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, it's possible to work with SOAP without
understanding the underlying XML-encoded data. However, debugging
SOAP problems often requires that you look at the XML as well as
the HTTP headers that are sent in the request and the
response.</p><p>SOAP::Lite objects support the on_debug( ) method, which
takes a subroutine reference as an argument. This subroutine is
invoked for each SOAP transaction, meaning that we can log
information to the disk or screen. The simplest use of on_debug( )
is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
on_debug(sub{print STDERR @_})
</pre><p>In other words, we ask SOAP::Lite to send a copy of
everything to STDERR. This provides us with a marvelous opportunity
to see what happens behind the scenes. After we invoke this method,
SOAPsh.pl reminds us that we invoked a local method rather than a
SOAP method:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--- METHOD RESULT ---
SOAP::Lite=HASH(0x82e1174)
</pre>


With debugging turned on, our invocation of capitalize(abc) from
before gets translated into a SOAP request (see Listing 3)
</p><p><a href="4519l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. SOAP
Request</a></p><p>As you can see, the request is divided into a header and a
body, as with all HTTP requests. And as with a normal HTTP request,
we indicate an action (&ldquo;POST&rdquo;) along with a URL, as a
Content-Length (indicating the number of bytes in the request) and
the Content-Type (which is always going to be &ldquo;text/xml&rdquo;).</p><p>Then the fun begins: the final header is SOAPAction, which
names the object and method that are being invoked. The SOAPAction
header is designed to allow corporate firewalls to filter out
dangerous objects and methods from being invoked. Currently,
however, it would seem that support for SOAPAction is relatively
hard to find. Besides, information about both the object and its
method are buried inside of the XML request and response
themselves, making the header unnecessary for parsing
purposes.</p><p>The XML itself begins with an XML declaration and then a SOAP
envelope. Inside the envelope is an optional header (not shown in
this particular invocation) and a mandatory body. The body names
the object and method that we wish to invoke, as well as any
arguments that we might have passed.</p><p>This XML is parsed into the native operating system and
language format and is then passed along to the target object. The
object returns a response value to the SOAP server which then
creates a SOAP response in XML as seen in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="4519l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. SOAP Response in
XML</a></p><p>The response, like the request, uses HTTP and HTTP headers to
pass some metadata, including the server type, date, content
length, type (&ldquo;text/xml&rdquo;) and even the type of SOAP server being
run.</p><p>The envelope for this particular response, like the request,
contains no header. However, it does contain a body, in which the
return value (of type &ldquo;xsd:string&rdquo;) is returned. While the
request uses a namespace of &ldquo;namesp3:capitalize&rdquo;, the response
uses a namespace of &ldquo;namesp1:capitalizeResponse&rdquo;. This is
standard in SOAP; XML namespaces are used to identify whether the
message contains a request or a response and for which method the
response is being sent.</p><p>Without any explanation, Listing 5 is the similar debugging
output from a call to capitalize_array(reuven, shira,
atara):</p><p><a href="4519l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Debugging
Output</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf7c28"></a>A SOAP Client</h2></div></div><p>SOAPsh.pl can demonstrate interactive requests, but SOAP is
much more useful when our programs can create and issue their own
requests. Listing 6 demonstrates the code for a simple SOAP client
that connects to our server on port 8080 of localhost. Notice how
the URI is once again the name of the object, and the proxy is the
name of the SOAP server.</p><p><a href="4519l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.
soap-client.pl</a></p><p>What is particularly amazing about SOAP::Lite is how it
allows us to invoke methods on our object that only exist across
the network. That is, the &ldquo;uri&rdquo;, &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; and &ldquo;result&rdquo; methods
obviously exist for the SOAP::Lite object. But the &ldquo;capitalize&rdquo;
method only exists for our remote Text/Caps object. SOAP::Lite is
normally smart enough to figure out the difference, passing along
any method that cannot be locally resolved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf7e38"></a>A CGI-based SOAP server</h2></div></div><p>Our standalone server was meant to be simple, and it is.
However, what happens when we begin to get millions of requests per
day? Then our standalone server will no longer be able to keep up,
and users' method calls will no longer be serviced.</p><p><a href="4519l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7.
cgi-soap.pl</a></p><p>A practical solution is to use a piece of software optimized
for receiving many incoming HTTP transactions, namely Apache. Using
Apache to handle our incoming SOAP transactions means that we can
scale it as high or as low as we need. Our server program no longer
needs to take this into consideration; it can focus on the mundane
details of receiving SOAP packets and passing them along to Perl
modules.</p><p>Creating a CGI-based SOAP proxy is not very different from
creating a standalone program. Perhaps the most important thing to
keep in mind is that you should not use CGI.pm or any other
CGI-related module with which you might be familiar. Remember that
the CGI program here is the SOAP proxy, and the CGI protocol is
being used to transfer the XML-encoded request and response back
and forth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf80a0"></a>Other Goodies</h2></div></div><p>SOAP::Lite comes with so many goodies, it's hard to know when
to stop describing them. For example, those of you who have been
convinced to use mod_perl in place of CGI will be pleased to know
that SOAP::Lite has native mod_perl support, along with CGI and
standalone support.</p><p>Your own programs can take advantage of the &ldquo;autodispatch&rdquo;
mechanism we saw above, in which any method name not recognized
locally is transmitted to a remote object.</p><p>SOAP::Lite can handle the transfer of most data structures
supported by SOAP, including objects. In other words, you can
invoke new( ) on a remote object, and then invoke various methods
on the object returned by new( ). This functionality has existed
for years on a number of specific platforms, but the fact that SOAP
makes it platform-independent is truly amazing.</p><p>Finally, SOAP has grown beyond its exclusive use of HTTP and
now supports a variety of other protocols, including some that we
might not expect, such as POP3 and SMTP. SOAP::Lite supports all of
these protocols; by the time you read this, it will undoubtedly
support many more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf82b0"></a>SOAP and Three-Tier Applications</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how SOAP can be used in simple
circumstances, let's consider how it might be used in more complex
situations. For example, let's assume that I have to create an
extremely large web site that depends on a back-end relational
database. In many cases, as regular readers of this column know, I
will prefer to do the implementation in mod_perl and
HTML::Mason.</p><p>But as the market for server-side Java grows, it's possible
that some or all back-end functionality might be available using
JavaBeans. Moreover, as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) becomes an
increasingly pervasive and intriguing technology for distributed
applications that require transactions, I might even prefer to do
some of the implementation in Java.</p><p>With SOAP, I am now free to mix and match languages and
platforms as I wish. If I create a SOAP server with access to the
appropriate Java objects, there's no reason why my Mason components
cannot communicate with a Java middleware layer. In some cases,
this might even be preferable even if the system begins as a
one-language affair. Given that Perl has no support for networked
transactions, we might want to write an initial implementation in
Perl and move toward EJB in the future. Using SOAP, this might be
possible and even desirable.</p><p>Finally, web application servers are already beginning to
work with SOAP. Not only does this allow objects on other computers
and written in other languages to communicate with a given server,
but it opens the door to Internet services that are not necessarily
based on the Web. Perhaps web-based newspapers will begin to offer
SOAP-based headline systems, taking the same content that is
available on their web site but packaging it in such a way that
someone can download a customized set of headlines with a single
SOAP call. With such a service in place, users could install a
desktop (non-web) application that would update itself to display
the latest headlines every few minutes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b07580.0x1bf84c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>SOAP heralds the beginning of a new type of distributed
Internet application, namely one that can perform remote procedure
calls across operating systems and programming languages. No longer
does RPC have to be a proprietary, difficult to-understand or
difficult-to-invoke process; in the course of an afternoon, you can
create a simple distributed application. Just what this means for
the future of the Web and the Internet is a good question, but
already some are claiming that desktop applications will
increasingly be GUI shells that send SOAP requests to centralized
servers. Regardless of what the future may bring, the fact that
Perl and other free languages can use SOAP means that we will soon
be able to communicate more easily than ever. And hey, isn't that
the whole point of the Internet?</p><p><a href="4519s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
