    Gasson shows how a few tweaks to Apache's httpd.conf file can
    provide a colorful web log file.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb33f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As a web hosting company, there are times
when it's vitally important to see what our Apache web server is
dishing up to the outside world at any one time&mdash;and to see this as
quickly as possible.
</p><p>Just as a system administrator needs to be able to monitor
system log files, a web administrator should be able to do the same
with web logs. Noting the number of utilities that display system
log information in real time, I was sure there'd be similar
programs for monitoring web logs. After a search through
Freshmeat.net and other on-line resources, I didn't find anything
that met all of my needs. Several came close, but most would only
monitor one file, and the few that monitored several files would
leave me lost trying to wade through tabs for the 30 or so logs
that I watch.</p><p>The solution I found isn't in one program, but in making a
few changes in Apache's httpd.conf file I found I could have a
specialized disposable log file containing only the information I
require, for all of our web hosts. The &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; monitoring
log is then displayed using colortail (with additional
configuration settings) on an external monitor in our workshop. I
can see at a glance which of our hosts have current web activity,
where the traffic is coming from and the pages that are being
accessed. This has also allowed us to deal quickly with problems
such as script kiddies and rogue search engine robots. The system
has worked so well for us that we added system logging to it as
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb35b0"></a>httpd.conf Changes</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the LogFormat for general logging, I added a
new format labeled &ldquo;webmonitor&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LogFormat "[%v] %h %u \"%r\"%&gt;s%b\n\"%{Referrer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"%t" webmonitor
</pre><p>This displays log information with the Referrer and
User-Agent on a second line, making it clearer to read. The log
file could be in any format&mdash;even the &ldquo;common&rdquo; one we use for
standard logging. I decided to change it for purposes of clarity
and because Apache is flexible enough to allow this.
</p><p>Since graphic files such as GIFs, JPEGs or PNGs files can
clutter up the display, I exclude them by adding the following
three lines to the general log section in httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SetEnvIf Request_URI \.gif$ unwanted
SetEnvIf Request_URI \.jpg$ unwanted
SetEnvIf Request_URI \.png$ unwanted
</pre><p>We use name-based virtual hosts, and each host has their own
&lt;VirtualHost&gt;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt; container. In addition to
their permanent log file, we add an additional CustomLog command
for our webmonitor file for each of our hosts. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost someisp.com&gt;
...
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/someisp.com-access_log combined
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/webmonitor_log webmonitor env=!unwanted
...
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>


Our addition is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/webmonitor_log webmonitor env=!unwanted
</pre>


/var/log/httpd/webmonitor_log is the path and filename for our
monitoring log file, and Apache will create it for us at startup if
it doesn't already exist. webmonitor is the name of our custom
format log defined in the LogFormat section above.
<b  >env=!unwanted</b> sets Apache so it doesn't log any
items we've listed in the SetEnvIf lines (the .gif, .jpg and .png
file extensions). This way we don't see graphic file requests but
we do see all others.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3978"></a>Adding System Log Information</h2></div></div><p>The ability to see what's happening on the server with an
external monitor proved so useful that we also included system
logging information in the same file. To do this, we edited
/etc/tem syslog.conf to include the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kern.*;authpriv.*;*.crit;*.error;*.warning;*.emerg /var/log/httpd/webmonitor_log
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3ad8"></a>Colortail</h2></div></div><p>Colortail was written by Joakim Andersson
(pt98jan@student.hk-r.se) and is available from
<a href="http://www.student.hk-r.se/~pt98jan/colortail.html" target="_self">www.student.hk-r.se/~pt98jan/colortail.html</a>
under the GNU Public License.</p><p>While we could simply tail the webmonitor log file, adding
color to the display is a nice touch and gives us an indication of
which web host is seeing activity even if we happen to be on the
other side of the workshop.</p><p>Colortail comes with several sample configuration files; none
really suited web logs, although conf.xferlog comes close. After a
bit of tweaking, this is the format we've been using. It's a hybrid
as it includes both web and system-log-related items.</p><p><a href="4430l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
colortail.conf</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3d98"></a>Displaying the Colortail</h2></div></div><p>To use colortail locally, you could use a command such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
colortail -f -k /etc/colortail /var/log/httpd/
 &lt;@cont_arrow&gt;&lt;\#229&gt;&lt;@$p&gt;webmonitor_log &amp;
</pre><p>This is fine except that it doesn't allow us to have it on
screen all the time, and I'd often need to switch to the particular
console or X window displaying the log.
</p><p>To be able to monitor activity better, we display the
colortail output on a Commodore 128D computer connected to the
system. Our particular set up has our C128 connected to a private
server using a null modem and PPP connection. From here, we log in
to the server with the log files. You can use any inexpensive spare
computer you may have lying around for this purpose, as long as
it's capable of handling ANSI or VT100 emulation and has an
80-column display. PPP isn't a requirement.</p><p>Rather than type the command to start the colortail on the
Commodore machine, we use a nightly cron program that rotates the
log file and then sends the colortail output to the PTY device. See
Listing 2 for the file used for this purpose.</p><p><a href="4430l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Cron
Program</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb40b0"></a>Wrap Up</h2></div></div><p>There are probably as many ways to monitor log files as there
are Linux users, but that's part of the fun. While there really
isn't anything &ldquo;new&rdquo; about using colortail to display log files,
this is a different combination of resources from those I've read
about, and it works for my requirements. Hopefully, this article
will help others looking for a way to view real-time web
activity.</p></div></div>
