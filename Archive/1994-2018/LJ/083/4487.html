last few months. Most of these have a target group of users (or, at
least, a target group of competitors). It's of necessity a shock
when, laden with packages of every description, a rather
graphically intensive version of Linux appears with so many
wonderful ideas and such incomplete implementations; one is left
reeling. It's rather like a pot-luck, all brought by one
individual, with such a vast array of dishes that you tend to feel
a mite guilty for thinking the individual in question might have
cooked the chicken for another 30 minutes. You don't want to seem
ungrateful, but there's the small matter of salmonella just waiting
for you.</p><p>For review purposes, Mandrake burned a prerelease set of
disks. These contained what was ostensibly to be on the published
CDs. There may have been changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f0580.0x17e8b88"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Graphical installations can be taken seriously by the more
technically minded, contrary to popular mores. I can install and
configure from the command line with the best of them, but I'm on
the hunt for a decent installation package that neither threatens
my mere 64MB RAM with KDE nor is reminiscent of nursery
d&eacute;cor. The hunt continues.</p><p>Even the most advanced Linux users among us occasionally make
mistakes, so the absence of a back button (at any point in the
installation) is on the &ldquo;Most Glaring Errors&rdquo; list. This is a
distribution that is targeted to, along with pretty much everyone
else, new Linux users. New users are a demographic that tend to
make errors or at least typos. Back buttons mean not having to
interrupt your install to reboot and start over.</p><p>That said, there are some lovely additions to the install
process. Configuration of networks, most hardware and the system
itself is made incredibly simple and, for those of us who know how
to do this manually, faster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f0580.0x17e8d40"></a>Package Overview</h2></div></div><p>In spite of the choice to select individual packages or
package groups, this process is daunting; 2,300 applications is a
fair amount of toys to play with, and a number of the more notable
ones were not able to be included here. Open Sales AllCommerceTM
E-Commerce Tool, Broadcast Video Editor and IBM's Via Voice were
among those not used for this review for reasons of system
configuration.</p><p>The documentation available for Mandrake 7.2 is extensive; in
addition to the usual HOWTOs, man pages and such, there are some
commercial books: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Linux</em></span> (Que, 2000)
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Hardware Handbook</em></span> (Sams, 2000) are
the more indispensable volumes included.</p><p>One rather nasty gaffe in the documentation was in the link
to Mandrake's English reference from Netscape, which should
read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
file://usr/share/doc/mandrake/en/mdkrefguide/index.html
</pre><p>but doesn't.
</p><p>There is an update utility that obtains bug fixes, new
versions of packages and the like. It's a sort of &ldquo;apt-get
upgrade&rdquo; for Mandrake, all wrapped in a GUI. It may make the
difference between liking and loathing your system.</p><p>The winning application (that is, the one that did not crash,
burn or otherwise suffer from extended running, testing and
learner-abuse) was ForteTM for Java. Granted, this is Sun's
brainchild, but that it runs under Mandrake rather well is a good
sign. Even IDLE didn't manage to initialize completely and then
refused to do anything during subsequent attempts to start
it.</p><p>The absence of screenshots here is indicative of what can go
wrong under Mandrake 7.2. I've had no problem with either the GNOME
screenshooter applet or the GIMP in any distribution&mdash;until
Mandrake. More's the pity, as the GUI really did look quite nice on
one or two occasions, and it would have been advantageous to have
pictures of the configuration tools. A good many of the standard
Helix GNOME applications and applets malfunction or cease
functioning in Mandrake. This, at one point, included the gdm
(which ironically, was the acronym for my response to yet another
&ldquo;oops&rdquo; from Mandrake).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f0580.0x17e9160"></a>Appearance</h2></div></div><p>The 4.0.1 version of X is included with Mandrake as the
default. XFree 3.3.6 ships as well for those who don't need the
extra functionality of 4.0.1. As stated earlier, this is
configurable with neither extensive experience or time
requirements.</p><p>I enjoyed the full range of themes available for Sawfish,
many of which are missing under other distributions. What other
distributions tend to have, however, is at most one or two
backgrounds that could be considered &ldquo;self-promoting&rdquo;.
Additionally, they don't give the impression of being designed for
a four-year-old's bedroom.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f0580.0x17e92c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>It's anyone's guess whether runtime problems are due to
libraries, or to unflagged dependencies, even the &ldquo;optimized&rdquo;
Mandrake kernel 2.2.17. (This is an issue I'll discuss another
time, but suffice it to say that an increasing number of Linux
distributions have souped-up kernels and are inadvertently making
an argument for standardization in the process.) For whatever
reason, or combination of reasons, a good many of the applications
included with Mandrake are not able to run or don't run as smoothly
as they do under other distributions.</p><p>Mandrake is the kind of distribution one
<span   class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> to like very much. It's cheery, and the
good folks at Mandrakesoft have been so generous with packages, one
wants to be able to say, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; The best one can, honestly,
get away with is to admit that it's good in some parts. Most
frequently, those parts have to do with ideas, rather than the
implementation thereof.</p><p><a href="4487s1.html" target="_self">Good/Bad</a></p></div></div>
