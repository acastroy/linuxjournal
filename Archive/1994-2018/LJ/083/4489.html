    Being able to run Linux flawlessly on a machine with faulty
    memory that would otherwise be discarded makes a lot of sense&mdash;the BadRAM
    patch makes it happen.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a54580.0x1b4c558"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are several common causes for
failure of memory modules. Before solving the problems in software,
let's turn to these causes. To understand them, please take a look
at Figure 1, which shows schematically what the structure of a
(faultless) memory is. Note how the memory is laid out in a
(roughly equal) number of rows and columns. Each crossing marks the
location of a memory cell, usually storing a single bit. As a
result, a memory cell's address is the combination of its row
address and column address. Memory modules are fed with these two
halves of the address separately (sequenced), so that their address
bus is only half the size you would expect. This halving of
addresses is handled a by the hardware on your motherboard.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4489f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Memory Structure without Problems
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The first place where things can go wrong is during the
manufacture of these memory modules. This is a very sensitive
process, mainly because the dimensions of the chip layouts are
getting smaller as the world grows hungry for more memory. Chip
manufacture is also quite wasteful of environmental resources
because a lot of highly purified chemicals are needed to construct
the tiny, sand-derivative product that you eventually buy.
Moreover, the sensitivity of the chip manufacturing process makes
many chips fall out due to error.</p><p>One method of partially solving this problem is to build
redundancy into the chips, say including 33 rows of memory cells
for every 32 rows; when one row fails, route the signals around it
to the extra row. Indeed, this technique is applied by some
manufacturers. Nevertheless, unsustained rumors claim there still
is a 60% drop-out rate. Needless to say, this factor makes memory
expensive.</p><p>Errors caused during production can take the shape of a speck
of dust that sat on the chip while enlightening or developing one
of its layers, as in Figure 2. The grayed-out area is the part that
may malfunction as a result of that speck of dust.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4489f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Memory Etching Disturbed
</p></div></div><p>Another source of error is static discharge. This is the same
effect that makes a woolen or nylon sweater spark a shock when
taken off. The reason for the spark is a high voltage between two
nearby surfaces. When they come close enough, the spark suddenly
jumps over, ionizing the air it passes and, thus, suddenly making
it conduct quite well, resulting in a high current for a very short
period. Actually, this is the same effect as lightning, only not as
powerful, of course. The small structures in a chip are quite
sensitive to these aggressive discharges. Static discharge usually
damages the &ldquo;buffers&rdquo;, the connections between rows/columns and
the address selection logic, as shown in Figure 3. This effectively
means that a whole row, or a whole column, or even a few of them,
become unusable, shown again by the grayed-out area. There are the
memory fault patterns that I have seen the most.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4489f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Memory Buffers Damaged by Static Discharge
</p></div></div><p>A last source of error, and up to now I have no certain proof
of ever having encountered it, is the gradual decay that all chips
are subjected to. This is the process by which the sharply distinct
regions of different materials on the chip blur and mix together.
This is a natural effect, and if a chip is kept sufficiently cool,
it usually takes decades to happen. In the case of memory, no
problem, it usually gets outdated for its speed and size long
before this point.</p><p>The important point of all these errors is that they stick&mdash;I
am not aware of any technical cause that could lead to random
errors. Mind you, it may happen that errors only occur in
particular patterns of the surrounding bits, but even then, the
error once settled, always occurs in that situation.</p><p>Furthermore, errors don't happen for no reason. In all of the
above situations, a sudden burst of energy causes the errors, or
they are caused by a very slow process. So, we need not expect
errors to jump up all of the time, not even on a defective memory
module.</p><p>Because errors in memories do not evolve, it is usually
possible to circumvent the errors by making smart use of dynamic
memory allocation techniques.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a54580.0x1b4ce48"></a>Detecting Memory Errors</h2></div></div><p>There are basically two ways of detecting errors in memories.
One approach is the use of a special program that scans all of the
memory in the machine and reports the failing addresses. One such
program that excels in finding errors is
<span   class="bold"><b>memtest86</b></span>, targeted at i386-based
machines. Naturally, trusting the results from such a memory
checker relies on the stability of memory errors, which usually
turns out to be an okay assumption; I've been running my machine
for months without a change in the detected error patterns.</p><p>The alternative is based on hardware detection. In the 30-pin
SIMM days, it was quite common to include a ninth bit with
&ldquo;parity&rdquo; information on the memory module. The idea is that the
ninth bit, which is actually stored separately on the memory
module, contains the bit to make the parity of the whole chip even
(or odd, whatever the design of the motherboard wants). When
writing, this bit is generated, and when reading back, it is
checked. If this read-time check fails, a parity error is
thrown.</p><p>A modern alternative to parity bits is ECC, short for Error
Correction (and detection) Code. These are usually based on some
CRC hash from the bits stored, and they can be used to detect up to
three faulty bits out of 32, as well as to correct up to two faulty
bits. (I am actually uncertain about these precise values, but it's
the principle that counts.) So, with ECC RAM, it is possible to
detect errors, as well as correct them if they are not too
savage.</p><p>Modern memory modules as we use them in PC workstations
usually come with neither parity nor ECC. On the other hand, it is
standard to find ECC in high-end (server) systems as sold by VA
Linux and Sun. These usually work with ECC memory, or at least with
parity memory. I believe that most common PCs are capable of
working with ECC memory, they just don't get that memory plugged in
because ECC RAM is more expensive. Yes, this is the low-quality
world of PCs blinking an eye at you.</p><p>With parity RAM or ECC RAM it would be possible to detect
errors on the fly, without the need for a special program like
memtest86. Currently however, the BadRAM patch we present here is
kept as simple as possible (to increase chances of acceptance in
mainstream kernels) and, therefore, does not deal with the added
possibilities of ECC RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a54580.0x1b4d108"></a>Describing Errors as Memory Patterns</h2></div></div><p>We assume a memory checker like memtest86 finds errors in
memory modules. As explained, this checker lists all erroneous
addresses it finds. And, because a whole row or column may fail
after a static discharge, this could lead to extremely long lists
of errors, hundreds of errors not being an exception. Naturally,
such a list would be tedious and error prone to enter into the
kernel, and it may also give rise to problems caused by strictly
limited resources at boot time. It would be ideal to have a very
small representation of all the errors found.</p><p>Luckily, memory errors are usually laid out in regular
patterns, such as starting at address
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234</b>, every
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;0040</b> bytes, over 16
occurrences&mdash;or a bit more variation, of course.</p><p>The regularity is often easiest to see when doing binary.
That is because the rows and columns are addressed by spreading
address bits over these lines, and by interpreting part of the
address to decide whether the used address lines fall into the
correct region.</p><p>A single error can be described as an address, of which all
bits are valuable information. We write this, for example, as
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;ffff</b> where the
first number is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>base address</em></span> and the
second number is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>mask</em></span>. The &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits in the
mask indicate which of the corresponding base address bits are
valuable. If, aside from this address, also the address plus
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;0040</b> is wrong, then we can simply
alter the mask to represent this. The resulting address/mask pair
now becomes
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;ffbf</b>. We can
see that this is correct because the addresses covered are all
addresses A for which (A &amp;
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;ffbf</b>)=<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234</b>,
or concretely, <b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234</b> and
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1274</b>. If there are 16 faulty
addresses with this intermittent offset, then the whole thing
becomes <b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;fc3f</b> to
capture faulty addresses: <b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1234</b>,
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;1274</b>, ...,
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;15f4</b>.</p><p>This approach works well to capture faults over a row or
column, as long as these cover a power of two for bits, which is
normal. It also works to capture the specks of dust that disable a
few neighboring bits on the chip. But what if a memory module
contains more errors? Or, similarly, if multiple memory modules
each have errors? To cover these cases, we usually assume a list of
the aforementioned address/mask pairs. In practice, it turns out
that five of these pairs suffice for most practical situations. Be
aware that any set of errors can always be compacted in as little
as one such pair, albeit with loss of good addresses,
<b  >0&lt;\#215&gt;0000,0&lt;\#215&gt;0000</b> being the
ultimate example that captures all errors, but unfortunately, no
good addresses. With five pairs, we usually have no problems that
extreme.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>memtest86</b></span>, starting with
version 2.3, is able to generate BadRAM patterns that can directly
be entered on the command line of a BadRAM-patched Linux kernel. In
the above example, memtest86 would report a sequence of evolving
patterns, eventually leading to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
badram=0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;fb3f
</pre><p>Having written this down, you may now reboot the system and
enter this on the command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
LILO: linux badram=0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;fb3f
</pre>


and your system should boot fine, ignoring the broken memory parts.
Now, go ahead and add this line to your /etc/lilo.conf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
append="badram=0&lt;\#215&gt;1234,0&lt;\#215&gt;fb3f"
</pre>


and run LILO. You will not have to enter the address/mask pairs
anymore on consecutive boots.

additional 32K. The Sinclair memory expansion kit was comprised of
64K chips, of which either the high or the low half was known to
work while the other half was faulty, which made the price lower
than the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; expansion method with 32k chips. By selecting
some toggle on the motherboard, the computer was instructed which
half of the expansion memory chips it should use. Basically, the
BadRAM patch does the same thing, with a bit more
refinement.</p><p>Memory management units, which are a necessity for all Linux
distributions to work well, redirect a page as accessed by a &ldquo;user
space&rdquo; program to any physical page. What appears like a long
stretch of memory allocated just for your user process is, in
reality, scattered over the memory modules (and may even be swapped
out). When a user-level program allocates memory, the kernel gives
it out by allocating single pages of physical memory.</p><p>The only part of Linux that works in terms of physical memory
addresses is the kernel. It is loaded in the beginning of the
memory (obviously, you must not have errors in that region) and may
allocate blocks of memory from the same pile of free memory that is
also used to serve the user process.</p><p>This pile of memory is filled with the physical pages at boot
time. Actually all that the BadRAM patch does is leave out those
pages that fall in one of the address/mask pairs entered on the
command line.</p><p>This means that all the work involved in BadRAM is done at
boot time. Afterward, the only effect is that the pile of free
memory is a tad smaller. Extensive benchmarks have shown that this
has no measurable influence on runtime performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a54580.0x1f45fb8"></a>Alternative Applications</h2></div></div><p>When you make a patch like this, and certainly when you're
&ldquo;SlashDotted&rdquo; over it, you receive a lot of interesting e-mail,
some with ideas even weirder than those I thought of.</p><p>One proposal I've often heard is to perform a memory test at
boot time. Although this may seem interesting, it is not practical.
memtest86 does an excellent job, but it requires several hours. You
don't want this at boot time, and you also don't want to have a bad
memory test (we already have that in most PC BIOSes, anyway, and
BadRAM modules usually pass that test). The option of making a LILO
boot alternative for memtest86, or of having a memtest86 boot
floppy, has always been my preference.</p><p>I have had some reports of errors in motherboards which
corrupted a particular address of physical memory, perhaps due to a
short circuit with an on-board peripheral. One such reporter
informed me that he had put four modules of 512M in his machine to
limit the chances of hitting the erroneous address, but his
problems were entirely resolved by throwing out a single memory
page with the BadRAM patch. Discarding 4K out of 2G made his
machine work flawlessly.</p><p>I have also talked with someone who owns a PC from a large
PC-at-home project. The rather proprietary architecture of his
Compaq Deskpro did not foresee an option to switch off the 15M-16M
memory hole needed for some ISA cards. So, expanding memory to 24M
did not work on Linux 2.2 because setting mem=24M means that the
region 15M-16M works as, you guessed it, a memory hole. But, after
adding
<b  >badram=0&lt;\#215&gt;00f00000,0&lt;\#215&gt;fff00000</b>
to inform the kernel that the hole should be treated as BadRAM, he
got his additional memory going and was ready to add even
more.</p><p>Finally, I received romantic responses from people that had
worked with older systems that detected memory faults (using either
parity schemes or ECC schemes) and assigned a lower level of trust
to such faulty pages. When a page was &ldquo;under evaluation&rdquo;, it
would, at most, be used to load program code, the idea being that
program code is a verbatim copy off a hard disk and can be restored
if the error pertains. If it worked well for a while, the error
apparently had been something spurious, and the page would be
upgraded to &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo; again. However, if program storage also
didn't work, the page would be put out of use. This scheme would be
very interesting to support, but it would take up CPU cycles at
runtime and, therefore, should be seen as a very fancy
feature.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a54580.0x1f46278"></a>Possible Future Extensions</h2></div></div><p>There are a few ways to extend upon the BadRAM efficiency. It
is certainly possible to exploit ECC modules, both the ones that
have recoverable and unrecoverable errors. Since I lack both types
of modules, unfortunately, this is beyond my current ability. Also,
it burns CPU cycles and falls into the category of fancy
features.</p><p>Another option would be to exploit the slab allocator in the
kernel. Slabs are small, uniform and reusable memory blocks that
the kernel allocates in arrays that span, as closely as possible,
an integer number of memory pages. It would be possible to exploit
the error address information in more detail by using BadRAM pages
for slabs, thereby avoiding the allocation of slabs that overlap
error addresses. Ideally this could reduce the memory loss to
absolutely zero. In practice, however, it will not be far off the
standard BadRAM performance because an average system does not use
many slab pages at all. For this reason, I doubt if the additional
CPU overhead and coding effort would be worthwhile.</p><p>It is my sincere hope that memory marketing companies will
pick up this idea and start to publish (cheap) memory modules based
on broken memory. I propose a schema to classify such modules with
a logarithmical degree of &ldquo;badness&rdquo; as part of the in-kernel
documentation on the BadRAM patch.</p><p>All that remains now is to wish you good luck with your chase
for broken memory. Perhaps some befriended user of a less mature
operating system could spare it.</p><p><a href="4489s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
