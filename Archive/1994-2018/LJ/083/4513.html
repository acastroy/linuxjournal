</p><p>I sense an era ending.</p><p>Of course that's an easy call when the economy is falling
like a bad tent, but there's something more subtle and serious than
the Law of Cycles at work here. I think what's happening is a
widespread reacquaintance with reality&mdash;the reciprocal of
disillusionment. It shows up in what we're not buying: needlessly
faster computers, humorless comedies on TV, specious investment
schemes, vacuous campaign promises and promotional malarkey in all
its forms.</p><p>This seems to go beyond skepticism, mass ennui and declines
in disposable cash, though all those factors play. It comes from
sane judgment&mdash;the kind that rises from conversations with people
we trust, rather than from herd mentalities or propaganda machines
that try to command and control what we think, eat, buy and love.
More significantly, it comes from our own sense of
self-worth.</p><p>Around two years ago, I was involved in just such a
conversation. There was a growing sense among the four participants
that together we knew something that each of us alone couldn't
quite sum up. Finally, after a couple months of back-and-forth, one
of us (Christopher Locke, aka RageBoy) put what we all knew into a
few simple words: &ldquo;We are not seats or eyeballs or end users or
consumers, and our reach exceeds your grasp. Deal with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Soon as we heard it, we knew we had to say it again, louder
and in more detail, because we were speaking for the billions of
other people who also sensed the same thing but hadn't started
talking about it yet. The result was <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain
Manifesto</em></span>.</p><p>More than a few people (occasionally including myself) have
thought that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> was mostly about the
shift of market power from supply to demand. While that's true, I
think <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> was also about returning to
the true meaning of the word market, which finds its best synonym
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>bazaar</em></span>--a place where people come to do
business and make culture.</p><p>Markets were around for thousands of years before we started
using the word to label product categories, geographies,
demographic groups and demand itself. All those uses awaited the
rise of industry, which began about two hundred years ago.
Throughout the Industrial Age, talk about markets has been mostly a
supply-side activity. When we hear consumer electronics, office
supplies, Mexico and BMW drivers all referred to as &ldquo;markets&rdquo;, we
hear the supply side talking to itself. To the demand side, the
market is still mostly a place to shop&mdash;a bazaar.</p><p>Nothing has done more to raise bazaar consciousness than the
Open Source movement, starting with Eric S. Raymond's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>. While Eric didn't have much to
say about markets per se in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</em></span>, he did much to popularize the bazaar as a
conceptual metaphor. Google counts 355,000 web pages that contain
the word bazaar, and I would bet at least half of them wouldn't be
there if Eric hadn't spread the meme. And what better conceptual
metaphor for market than its most literal synonym?</p><p>So now the Open Source movement finds itself with two jobs.
One is explaining itself, and the other is explaining what markets
are really about. We already know the first isn't easy. Neither is
the second.</p><p>For generations we've been looking at both business and
markets from the industrial producer's position&mdash;one so corrupted
by the abstraction of demand that it can barely comprehend the
face-to-face, keyboard-to-keyboard nature of life in the bazaars
that markets naturally long to be. What we call &ldquo;consumerism&rdquo; is
really producerism, a tired ideology that believes it can forever
categorize and organize markets for its own convenience.</p><p>For a case in point, try to buy a computer from a mass
producer. If you're going to the biggest sources&mdash;Dell or
Gateway&mdash;be prepared to declare your category. No, not &ldquo;server&rdquo;,
&ldquo;desktop&rdquo; or &ldquo;laptop&rdquo;. We're talking about your category here.
What are you? they ask. Are you a consumer, a business or something
public like a local, state or federal government? Those are the
cattle chutes through which these producers want customers to click
their way toward a purchase.</p><p>That's rather annoying if you think of yourself more as
connoisseur than category. But who are you? More accurately, what
are you? To mass-producers, you're a consumer. Your job is to
consume. Or, in the perfect words of Jerry Michalski, you are a
&ldquo;gullet&rdquo;. That is, a creature &ldquo;who lives only to gulp products
and crap cash&rdquo;.</p><p>Millions of dollars move through Dell's cash plumbing every
day and not much less through Gateway's. Near as I can tell, there
isn't much negative burpage on the gullet side of the two
companies' transaction mills. Both enjoy wide regard as exemplary
producers. Their products tend to show up at or near the tops of
ranked reviews. So does their customer support. This begs a fair
question: what's the problem here?</p><p>Maybe, for Dell and Gateway, there isn't one. But I'm not so
sure. I think Dell and Gateway are just stuck with default
mass-marketing metaphors they'd rather do without if they knew how
customer-hostile those metaphors really are.</p><p>I was looking for data on the matter a few weeks ago when I
visited my new local Gateway Country Store. Wearing my invisible
objective journalist hat, I tried to be as positive and open-minded
as possible. It wasn't easy. The first thing I noticed after
passing through the door was a display on a kiosk that was
brain-locked into an error message that nobody had bothered to
correct, even though sales people seemed to outnumber the
customers. While I'm sure the electronic corpse on the kiosk had
been dead for hours, mere seconds passed before I was engaged by a
sales guy. A surreal conversation followed.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you have right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we run a home office with a bunch of Linux and Mac
boxes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We've got DSL running to the house, and the
boxes are all hubbed through Ethernet and a router to the Net. I'm
thinking of getting an all-purpose Windows box, running the same
software my accountant uses, testing out some multimedia
stuff...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you want Windows 98.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? 98? Not Millennium Edition or 2000?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can't run games or multimedia on Windows 2000.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can't use sound on a network.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Windows 2000 is a network OS. It doesn't do sound, except
with drivers we don't support. And if you're running a network you
don't want any of your employees downloading and playing MP3s at
work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do that all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you're running games or multimedia you're doing consumer
stuff. You want the consumer OS. If you want to set up a business
network, you need to talk to somebody on our business
staff.&rdquo;</p><p>Eventually I left without buying anything. Meanwhile I
observed that the place didn't seem very busy, even though this was
the height of the Christmas season. I also noticed that Gateway was
trying its best to do consumer marketing here. In other words,
herding consumers into corrals where they could be further sorted
into one sales chute or another. Nothing new, of course, except
that it felt real old.</p><p>Yeah, we're in an economic malaise right now. But I've also
been to Fry's and Best Buy, and those guys didn't seem to be
hurting for customers. They also don't seem to be going out of
their way to make customers declare their categories. Maybe that's
because they're real stores, not just channel strategies, which
means they're about markets, not just marketing. In real
markets&mdash;bazaars&mdash;customers have choices. The more, the better.
That's what we like most about Fry's and Best Buy, especially since
prices for the same products are in the same low range.</p><p>Choice matters on the supply side as well, and it doesn't
just take the form of the plethora. Those of us who operate with
the most autonomy and honesty on the supply side do so by choice.
We seek out the best work of our peers, take an interest in it,
borrow from it, talk about it, join in on some work or go off and
do our own thing. In traditional market terms, what we practice is
our craft. There is maximum choice on our side as well as the
customer's. That's how a bazaar&mdash;a real market&mdash;works.</p><p>Can big industrial producers have crafts? I think they can,
as long as they maximize the choices on both the supply and the
demand sides of their markets. That means they have to be open.
They have to expose the source of what makes them worthwhile as a
company in the world: namely, their own employees.</p><p>&ldquo;In the past, people were cheap and technology was
expensive,&rdquo; Don Marti says. &ldquo;Now it's the other way around.&rdquo; In
that case, producers need to expose exactly what makes the company
most valuable in the marketplace, and then trust the market to do
what markets do best.</p><p>Maybe then they'll start listening to what we've been saying
out here in the software bazaar. And we can listen to them,
too.</p><p>In fact, it's already happening.</p></div></div>
