through the steps of installing Debian Potato in a multiboot
configuration with Windows 98/NT/2K. Our machine will serve as the
desktop system of a software developer (me) making the transition
from supporting only the creation of Windows programs to supporting
Linux. Before we're done we will discover that several things in
the documentation can be misleading, and it's not advisable to
follow blindly the Debian instructions or Linux HOWTO documents
that you find on the Web.
</p><p>Our machine, primarily used as a Windows software-development
system, is an Abit BH6 motherboard Intel Celeron 300MHz PC with
128MB RAM, Yamaha CDRW, SoundBlaster Live!, Haupaugge WinTV,
Hercules Terminator 2x/i 8MB and two 20GB drives. That may not seem
like a very fancy machine, but it meets our needs. Our philosophy
is to avoid getting too far ahead of the curve with development
machines. We want to develop software on systems not too unlike
those our users have. This helps avoid unpleasant surprises such as
inadvertently creating software that won't run properly on anything
but the newest and most powerful PCs.</p><p>To avoid risk to the data on our existing drive, and also
because we're out of space, we have just installed a new 20GB
Maxtor DiamondMax Plus EIDE Ultra ADA/66 drive. A 7,200RPM drive,
the Maxtor is faster than our old 5,400RPM 20GB drive. That speed
is needed for doing work with video that tends to get I/O bound.
It's amazing how cheap big fast drives have become ($130 US). To
install the drive we had to drop the power supply and pull the AGP
card to get into the bay. The drive came with a Caldera DR-DOS boot
floppy containing documents, partition software and drive image
copy software, but we didn't use any of that. We swapped the ribbon
cable from our existing drive (temporarily disabling it) to our new
drive, booted to BIOS, did auto-detect of the drive, took the
default LBA setting and away we went. For all intents and purposes,
we are doing our install to a bare system. Our old drive is
deliberately off-line as a safety precaution.</p><p>Let's start, strangely enough, with installing Windows.
Versions of that OS aren't particularly friendly to any other
operating systems already residing on a PC. We can avoid some
hassle by installing Windows first, then Linux afterward. Windows
98SE sells for about $195 US and Win2K for about $265 US. Since we
build our PCs from parts, we don't get Windows included with our
PCs.</p><p>Windows 98 has three major versions: original, Second Edition
and Millennium Edition. We prefer SE or ME because support for
multiheaded monitors and other nifty device features was added. We
install Win98SE by booting from the CD (twice), choose non-large
disk support (FAT16), create a 2GB partition, provide int 3 and
0x300 parameters for our non-PNP ISA network card and enter our
behind-the-firewall IP of 192.168.1.2 with netmask 255.255.255.0.
We use the same login name and password for Win98SE and Win2K (not
administrator) because that means less hassle when opening network
Windows drives on a LAN.</p><p>Our network gateway is WinGate running on a WinNT box on our
LAN at 192.168.1.1. This seems totally backward perhaps, because
Linux is recognized as a better firewall than WinNT, but that's our
setup since we are starting from a Windows-only shop. This turns
the notion inside-out that Linux must be the server and Windows the
desktop, a misplaced idea that may hold typical Windows users back
from trying Linux on the desktop.</p><p>We boot Win98SE successfully from the hard drive and connect
across our LAN to our treasure trove of downloaded Win98 drivers.
Having a second PC available while building a PC can speed up the
process considerably. One of the first things to do is install the
correct video driver so that we can get out of 640x480 VGA mode.
Here we encountered our first trouble. Win98SE has a redesigned
video subsystem that chokes on the Win98 driver for our Hercules
Terminator 2x/i video card. The screen goes blank. We need to boot
in safe mode (plain VGA), a task made more challenging because the
magic keystroke to boot safe mode in Win98SE is Ctrl and not F8 as
it was in Win98. We couldn't figure this out at first. Windows
doesn't display what keystrokes are available at boot up. Cutting
the power forces a safe mode boot. We install an alternate driver
from WinDrivers.com. The rest of the Win98 install goes without
incident.</p><p>We installed Windows 98 first because it is the least
tolerant of other operating systems. It has a proclivity to
overwrite the MBR (Master Boot Record). Next we install Windows
2000 Professional. The pro edition is the desktop version, the
replacement for Windows NT Workstation. There is no amateur
version; the other flavor is Server. We boot Win2K from CD and
create a 2GB partition in NTFS. The Win2K install goes flawlessly.
We can now boot Win98SE or Win2K using the Windows boot loader
c:/ntldr. We are careful to create emergency disks for both Win98SE
and Win2K. Fortunately, we won't need them.</p><p>We created our Win98SE partition as FAT16 because Linux and
MS-DOS can read/write FAT16. There isn't any benefit to FAT32
unless the drive partition is larger than 2GB (if you at some time
use Win98 fdisk, refuse large disk access). We want to use NTFS
with Win2K for many reasons, but mainly because it avoids the
time-consuming Windows scandisk process if we have a crash. A hard
reboot on NTFS is no fuss normally. We prefer to put an OS on its
own 2GB partition because we have found that increases reliability
under Windows. Now, let's install Debian Linux.</p><p>According to Debian founder Ian Murdock, the most unique
aspect of Debian development as compared to other Linux
distributions is the fact that it has been and continues to be
developed openly by a group of volunteers, and that it is open to
other volunteers who wish to join the effort. Debian is not
developed by one individual or a small, closed group. Instead, it
follows in the tradition of the Linux kernel; it is developed by
those who use it, and this makes for a higher quality, more dynamic
and truly modular system [see <i  >LJ</i> November
1999, &ldquo;Overview of the Debian GNU/Linux System&rdquo;].</p><p>The Debian web site
(<a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_self">http://www.debian.org/</a>)
points out that Debian GNU/Linux provides more than 3,950 packages
of precompiled software bundled for easy installation. It should be
noted that Debian is widely recognized as the most pure
distribution in the free software and open-source philosophy. Free
software advocates will enjoy reading the Debian &ldquo;social
contract&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract" target="_self">http://www.debian.org/social_contract/</a>.
With Debian there is no company in the sense that there is for Red
Hat. That's not to say you can't get commercial support from a
company like LinuxCare if you want it. But, it is as a community of
mutual support that Debian especially appeals to Linux experts and
programmers, and the community support available on the Debian
Users' list is awesome. We found that we typically receive the
correct answer to a question there within ten minutes. And, the
tone of the group is a joy. If you ask how to do X, you get how to
do X, not that you should do Y, or a question asking why you want
to do X&mdash;simple, to the point.</p><p>Debian releases have names. The current release 2.2 is called
Potato, and the next release will be Woody. Initially we tried to
download Potato by FTP from a mirror site but found the
instructions too confusing and the download too time consuming (on
200KBs cable-modem). Many vendors offer Debian on CD, and some
offerings have more CDs than others. We got the full six-CD set
from Linux System Labs
(<a href="http://www.lsl.com" target="_self">http://www.lsl.com/</a>) for
$9. This was unbelievably cheap compared to what Windows costs.
When ordering you can also &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a $5 contribution to the Debian
organization if you like.</p><p>Installing Debian your first time is, to put it bluntly, sys
admin hell. The documentation tends to steer you away from what a
mere mortal needs to create a successful install. A forest of good
advice, bad advice, conflicting opinion and outdated
instructions&mdash;the documentation doesn't need to be that hard. And
in hindsight, maybe it isn't that hard. It's just very confusing
for first-timers. Back when I taught computer science at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey I was exposed to a term I hadn't
heard before (or since). Naval aviator students would ask for a
gouge. That is a document that accurately gives all the important
information but only the relevant information. Gouges are intended
for capable newbies and not written with painful detail. Debian
could really use some gouges. We'll guide you around the confusion
here.</p><p>Our first Debian problem: the LSL Potato CD won't boot. For
whatever reason it doesn't seem to have been made as a bootable CD.
We try to start it from Windows using
<b  >E:/install/boot.bat</b>, but the documentation
points out that the command only works in MS-DOS mode, not the
emulated DOS box console. In Win98SE, we pick &ldquo;Restart in MS-DOS
mode&rdquo; from the shutdown menu. That boots us into true MS-DOS just
fine, but do we have the necessary real mode DOS drivers to be able
to read a CD? No, of course not! Time to stop and rethink.</p><p>The on-line &ldquo;Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and
Usage&rdquo; document explains how to create boot floppies. The
instructions are wrong because the file names and CD layout have
changed for Potato, but the basic theory is correct. We ignore
numerous warnings we find on the Web that boot floppies are evil.
We have no trouble.</p><p>Here's how to boot Potato from two floppies when you can't
access the CD from DOS:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>In Win98SE copy the Debian CD directory of
E:/install to C: on your hard drive.</p></li><li><p>Restart in MS-DOS mode. The next step, making
floppies, won't work at the Windows DOS console.</p></li><li><p>At a real DOS prompt execute
C:/install/rawrite2.exe. (If you didn't follow our advice to make
the partition FAT16 instead of FAT32 you are hosed.) Enter
<b  >rescue.bin</b> and <b  >a:</b> at the
prompts.</p></li><li><p>Repeat with root.bin and a:.</p></li><li><p>Boot using the created rescue diskette, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>, you have a minimal Linux running
that can see the CD.</p></li></ol></div><p>Partitioning your hard drive can be scary. There's something
about the danger of irrevocably losing all your data. The Debian
installer will put you into Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>cfdisk</b></span> which works very nicely but
is intimidating at first. Standard warning: to avoid problems only
partition using software intended for the OS you are partitioning
for.
</p><p>Something to keep in mind with partitioning is that there is
only room for four entries in a drive's partition table. Primary or
extended partitions use one entry. However, logical partitions
within a single extended partition don't count. Win98SE is a
primary partition. WinNT or Win2K are created by default as logical
partitions. With any OS that will let you, and for all data
partitions, use logical partitions to avoid running out of
partition table entries. If you do run out you can't partition
whatever space is left on the disk. Linux needs two partitions: a
boot and a swap partition. We decided to make both Linux partitions
together a total of 2GB, subtracting 250MB for swap. We should have
put Linux on a logical partition, but not knowing any better we
made it a primary partition. This needlessly wasted a slot in the
partition table.</p><p>The Linux LILO boot loader is another program that strikes
fear into new users. Despite the reputation, its installation was
easy. We are glad we didn't follow the widespread advice of making
Windows <span   class="bold"><b>ntldr</b></span> our primary boot
loader (as suggested in linuxdoc.org &ldquo;Win95 + WinNT + Linux
Multiboot Using LILO Mini-HOWTO&rdquo;). Having LILO boot everything is
more elegant and was less trouble to install, too. When prompted,
install LILO in the MBR (the default). This will temporarily
disable Windows booting. The next step is to regain access to ntldr
from LILO.</p><p>You touch up /etc/lilo.conf to point to Windows as an
&ldquo;other&rdquo; boot OS using the syntax as documented for multiboot into
DOS. By the way, if you don't already know how to operate a Unix
text editor such as vi you will definitely learn. Don't forget to
touch up /boot/bootmess.txt and run <b  >/sbin/lilo</b>
to take all your changes. Reboot and LILO puts us into ntldr (when
asked) where we see the usual Windows OS boot selector screen.
Win98SE boots now. We have jumpered our old drive as slave device,
connected it to the same ribbon cable as our new drive, then booted
and auto-detected the drives in BIOS. Because we have a second
ntldr on /hdb we do some extra magic using the little known map
directive in lilo.conf to enable swapping boot drives. Now we can
boot Linux, our new copy of Win98SE and our old copies of Win98 and
WinNT:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other=/dev/hda1
        label=Win2k
        alias=2
        table=/dev/hda
other=/dev/hdb1
        label=WinNT
        alias=4
        table=/dev/hdb
        map-drive=0x80
        to = 0x81
        map-drive=0x81
        to = 0x80
</pre><p>Win98SE boots fine, but we get an &ldquo;ntoskernel missing&rdquo;
error trying to boot Win2K. The answer is to bump up the Windows
partition number in c:/boot.ini. When a primary partition is
installed later (as we did needlessly with Linux) it can bump up
the logical partition numbers. Just add one to the partition
number. Logical partitions must be contiguous to be in the same
extended partition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(3)\WINNT="Microsoft
    Windows
2000 Professional" /fastdetect
</pre>


We set the Linux network interface settings:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8),
# ifdown(8)
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.2
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.1.1
</pre>


We point to our firewall DNS in /etc/resolv.conf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver 192.168.1.
search 192.168.1.1
</pre>


To recap, the sequence we followed was to install all Windows
operating systems first, then Linux. Heady with success, we can now
boot Linux, Win2K, Win98SE, WinNT or Win98 using LILO! Next month
we will configure XFree86 so we can start X Window System and then
patch kernel 2.2.17 to install Video4Linux. That will give us
television video on our Linux screen.
