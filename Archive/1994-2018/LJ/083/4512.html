founder of the Microwindows Project, a GUI/windowing solution for
embedded systems and devices. In this interview, Haerr relates how
he came to be working with embedded Linux, explains why he created
Microwindows, offers a brief comparison between Microwindows and
alternative embedded GUIs, contemplates the future of Microwindows
and offers his perspective on open source.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: When were you first
exposed to Linux, and what led you to begin developing
GUI/windowing software for Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: My involvement with
Linux goes back to 1993, to one of the first 386 distributions,
Yggadrisil. I remember that this distribution came with a boot
floppy and a CD, which was new for the time. On bootup, the system
ran the UMSDOS file system, which allowed Linux to run on top of
the MS-DOS system's free space, and then proceeded to run the X
Windows System, display a login prompt and play the theme to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span>. The display would switch between
three graphics resolutions when you hit the Alt-Plus key...Linux
has always shown from the start its extreme adaptability to
differing hardware environments and its ability to take maximal
advantage of that hardware with minimal user
reconfiguration.</p><p>I've been programming for over 25 years, long before I became
a businessman. Although I've followed Linux for seven years, it's
only been during the last two years that I've contributed heavily
to important projects. It's definitely been worth it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: To date, the greatest
popularity of Linux has been in the area of web servers and
Internet infrastructure systems. Why do you feel Linux is a good
choice for embedded systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: Why run Linux on
embedded devices? In my estimation, there are at least four
compelling reasons that show that Linux will continue to grow
extremely rapidly in the next decade. First, the 32-bit
microprocessor has finally come down in price and power
requirements, and up in speed so that it can be used very cost
effectively in the embedded devices desired today, including
handheld computers, webpad-like devices and devices running
flat-panel displays. And Linux nearly from the start has been a
multiple-architecture operating system, which already supported
these advanced RISC processors. So the convergence of Linux and
embedded is quite natural.</p><p>Secondly, and especially in the graphical area in which I'm
focused, software developers and systems architects want to
leverage the tremendous success that has occurred on the desktop to
more portable devices. There's no need to reinvent the wheel when
so many applications that have propelled the desktop forward can
now be used to enable wireless handheld computing.</p><p>Finally, Linux, being royalty-free and open source, allows
the manufacturers to control their costs during the development
phase, while sharing inventions and algorithms allows the best
implementations to be deployed, which is a win-win for producers
and consumers alike.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: How does Linux compare
to the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; operating systems that have been used in the
embedded market? That is, OSes like VxWorks, pSOS, VRTX,
etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: One of the key
advantages Linux has over other choices comes in the development
cycle: developers run exactly the same operating system on their
desktop as they deploy on the target embedded device. This means
that they are as completely familiar with the features and
capabilities of the target device as they are of the desktop. For
instance, in Century Software's new Microwindows operating
environment and development toolkit for the Compaq iPAQ, we can
completely simulate the target device graphical screen layout on
the desktop host environment, thus allowing the applications to be
built and tested while the hardware is also being developed.</p><p>Of course there are other advantages too, especially for
those customers that already have a considerable investment in
UNIX, whether it be from Sun, DEC, HP or IBM. And that is if you've
got applications that you've developed for the UNIX environment and
want to take advantage of the newly available capabilities of
handheld and wireless technology, it's unbelievably more simple to
deploy those UNIX applications on Linux than it is to try to run
them on say, Windows CE. And of course since the majority of web
servers are already running Linux, it's natural to build
client-side applications using the Linux operating system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: What made you begin
developing Microwindows? What did you have in mind when you started
the project&mdash;what were your goals?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: Well, I designed the
Microwindows windowing environment initially for fun, since I have
a love of small systems doing big things. However, this quickly
turned into a project where user interest drove me to implement
features found only on more advanced systems, but in a small space,
without having to be ultimately general. For instance, Microwindows
supports anti-aliased text, TrueType and Adobe Type 1 fonts and
alpha blending, all of which X is just getting around to
support.</p><p>Microwindows, when compared to X and including all the
libraries, is still an order of magnitude smaller than X. But there
is work being performed to bring the size of the X Window System
down to a sub-megabyte. However, the complexity difference between
Microwindows and X will always be great. In embedded-systems
designs, there is always the issue of taking maximum advantage of
the hardware, since that is what the appliance is being built for
in the first place. So when you've got to interface to the hardware
for graphics acceleration or when adding a strange touchpad device,
it's an order of magnitude simpler implementing this for
Microwindows rather than X. And Microwindows' Nano-X protocol is
very similar to X, except that it's got a much simpler color model,
which makes applications easier to design.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: What other
alternatives are you aware of that, shall we say, compete with
Microwindows in terms of GUI support for embedded systems and
devices?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: I would say that
there's probably three competitors in this space, that is, when
you're talking about the technology creators. In addition to
TrollTech, there's the PocketLinux folks with the Java
implementation. Although Century, TrollTech and Transvirtual could
be seen as competing, actually each solution is really a different
approach to bringing applications to market, and each has its
strong points that are well suited in a particular area. For
instance, Transvirtual's PocketLinux is a nice Java implementation
that runs on framebuffer and implements a small but complete set of
applets, which is great if you're running Java. But it won't run
any non-java application, so it's not well suited for
general-purpose work. TrollTech's Qt/Embedded is in a similar
situation but works for a large desktop Linux audience. The
Qt/Embedded Project is, along with the entire Qt class library, a
fantastic implementation of a very Windows-look-and-feel
applications framework that will port with very little, if any,
modifications to an embedded device with a framebuffer. However,
Qt/Embedded won't run any non-Qt applications. It's also a lot of
source code and is considerably complicated.</p><p>The Microwindows operating environment is the fastest of the
lot and is well suited for general applications development, where
it can't be relied on that all the applications will require a
certain look-and-feel, widget set or Java implementation. This
general environment is well suited for platforms where a large
third-party contribution is desirable, such as devices made for the
general public or where different technologies must be applied
together without restricting the language or APIs used for
development.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: Another important
requirement in embedded Linux systems with graphical interfaces is
the browser. You've started a browser project too&mdash;ViewML. What
other alternatives are there, and how do they compare with
ViewML?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: Of course I'm partial
to ViewML, which is the open-source embedded browser created by
Century Software. ViewML runs in 800K ROM and 2.1MB RAM, and so it
works very well with small devices. But it's quite limited in what
you can do, given its small footprint. Recently, a group in
Australia ported the full Mozilla browser to Microwindows, and it
actually works. So depending on the requirements, people now have
both a small footprint as well as a fully featured browser
available. Opera gets very high marks for HTML compatibility, and
they have an unreleased Microwindows version as well.</p><p>With our Microwindows operating environment product, we've
been focusing on getting ViewML working well and running fast
enough to run on the small PDAs as well as the larger faster ones.
In this way, our product comes with a browser that can be used on
any device, and we can always upgrade to Mozilla if the customer
has enough RAM.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: What were some of the
challenges you faced in developing ViewML, and how did you overcome
them? What were some of the design tradeoffs that you needed to
make?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: Size constraints were
the biggest issue, as was the business of making sure that the
browser displayed the pages correctly. Since we didn't want to
write a browser from scratch, falling prey to the many other
browsers that just can't display pages correctly, we selected the
KDE Project's kfm KHTML widget. We selected this HTML display
widget with two priorities: first, it displayed pages almost
perfectly, and second, it was small and well written. The ViewML
Project then proceeded to implement an embedded browser without
changing a single line of code in the KHTML widget, thus
guaranteeing we couldn't screw it up too badly. We wrote a
QT&Yacute;FLTK class conversion layer, which allowed us to
implement all the user interface and widget controls in less than
100K, and the result was ViewML. Most of the work so far has been
on finalizing the implementation of this conversion layer. The
other consideration was making sure the browser speed is fast
enough for everyday users, and we're still working on TrueType font
display enhancements in this area.</p><p>In the future, we're thinking of moving to KDE's Konquerer
v2.0 HTML widget, which features full HTML v4.0 and JavaScript 1.4
capabilities, and that will also be implemented through this
conversion layer giving a tremendous decrease in space
requirements.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: In retrospect, what
has it been like leading an open-source project?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: The Microwindows
Project wouldn't be what it is today without the generous
contribution of some very important technologies, like the scalable
font support, countless debugging on a wide variety of systems and
considerable discussion on the mailing list. I must say I've had a
heck of a lot of fun being its leader. The Open Source community
has had a very positive effect by testing my implementations and
others' contributions almost immediately after release. Believe me,
if it doesn't work, I'll hear about it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: Unlike Linux,
Microwindows isn't released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL). Could you comment on the Microwindows license?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: The early Microwindows
contributors and I decided to license Microwindows as MPL, which is
a looser license than GPL. This means that Microwindows can be used
in projects under NDA or where driver source cannot be made
available. Although this is contrary to open-source purists, I'm
more of a pragmatist, and my real mission is enabling the growth of
the embedded industry with graphical applications. In order to do
this, you have to have a system that many people can use, and the
license should be as generous as possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: What new Microwindows
features or enhancements are planned for development over the
coming year or so?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Greg</b></span>: Well, we're going to
be producing our freely available binary distribution of the
Microwindows operating environment for a lot more PDAs that are on
the market or are soon to come to market. This will leverage all
developers' interest in Microwindows and allow their applications
to run on more platforms.</p><p>Another very exciting area will be our inroads into the
webpad arena. I've got an architecture designed that will allow
developers and users to run the same graphical-applications
binaries across a large array of flat-panel-enabled devices, which
hopefully will enable the continued fast growth we've been seeing
in this embedded space. The applications can take a different look
and feel depending on whether the device screen is 240x320 or
800x600, as well as 2-D, 3-D and TV-looking controls being
implemented by the toolkits.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rick</b></span>: Thank you very
