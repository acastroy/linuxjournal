    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e34a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The premiere edition of a column is
usually the place where the writer introduces him or herself (hi,
my name is Leslie, and I'll be your columnist) and stakes out the
territory that will be covered (welcome to .org Watch! Our
specialty will be tracking the developments and trends in the .org
community. We'll profile a .org or discuss a trend or issue and
give news briefs). Really, who am I to buck tradition? So, welcome
to .org Watch!
</p><p>For the initiated, what I'm about to say is very, very
obvious. However, I'm constantly amazed by the number of people
entering into the Linux space who don't understand that the history
of the GNU/Linux .org community is the history of Linux. Tracking
the trends and developments&mdash;of what would be a marginalized group
anywhere else&mdash;is vital because some of the best innovations come
from the .orgs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e3608"></a>Profile&mdash;The Linux Greenhouse</h2></div></div><p>The Linux Greenhouse
(<a href="http://www.linuxgreenhouse.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxgreenhouse.org/</a>)
describes itself as a &ldquo;virtual incubator&rdquo;. But don't let the word
&ldquo;incubator&rdquo; scare you. The Linux Greenhouse is a completely
different animal from the incubators that have come under fire
recently. For starters, it is a nonprofit organization that doesn't
charge participants or take an equity stake. In many ways, the
Linux Greenhouse is more like a lab than an incubator.</p><p>Companies or projects that are chosen to participate must be
open source and have high potential. Once chosen, they are given
access to resource executives from various Linux businesses. The
Linux Greenhouse's mission is to develop a bank of investors and
business development, marketing and public relations executives who
are willing to donate a little time and expertise to Greenhouse
participants. The goal is to give the participating companies
access to resources that are hard to come by during the startup
phase. It will also give the resource executives an inside track to
forming strategic alliances with some small, high-potential
companies and projects that may be flying under the radar.</p><p>The first Linux Greenhouse class met for a week in Seoul,
Korea in June at Global Linux 2000 and consisted of projects and
companies from Belgium, China, England, Finland, France, Germany,
Korea, Sweden and the United States. Projects include Linux-based
intranets in China, a French company that is developing
sophisticated Linux-based environments for handheld devices and a
web-design system, and a project that is teaching Linux to
continuing education students in Sweden. The class of 2001 will be
chosen in April, and application forms should be available on-line
in mid-February.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e3818"></a>News Briefs</h2></div></div><p>Free Software Foundation Europe</p><p>Free software advocates on the continent have formed the Free
Software Foundation Europe
(<a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org" target="_self">http://www.fsfeurope.org/</a>),
an acknowledged sister organization to the Free Software Foundation
(FSF) based in Boston, Massachusetts. MandrakeSoft has donated
2,500 euros to the organization.</p><p>&ldquo;We thank MandrakeSoft for this donation as it will allow us
to cover the legal expenses coming up.&rdquo; Georg C. F. Greve said.
&ldquo;We hope to establish a good and cooperative relationship for
future activities on behalf of free software and
GNU/Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>The FSF Europe is currently under development and plans to
take up work in Germany, France, Sweden and Italy by March. Other
European countries, including England, Belgium, The Netherlands and
Spain will be added shortly thereafter. The mission of the FSF
Europe will be the coordination of free software initiatives
throughout Europe.</p><p>The GIMP</p><p>The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a freely
distributed piece of software that can be used as a simple paint
program, an expert quality photo-retouching program, an on-line
batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image
format converter and so on. A new stable distribution, version 1.2,
has been released and can be downloaded at
<a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_self">http://www.gimp.org/</a>.</p><p>The GIMP recently won the Linux Community Award for &ldquo;Most
Innovative Desktop Software&rdquo; at the Systems 2000 show in Munich.
Carey Banks, Marc Lehmann and Simon Budig accepted the prize, which
included a trophy and a check for 3,000 DEM.</p><p>KDE</p><p>KDE
(<a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_self">www.kde.org</a>) has
released XParts, an extension written by Matthias Ettrichm, Simon
Hausmann and Lars Knoll, which extends KPart and makes it possible
to embed out-of-process components. XParts provides
interoperability with major UNIX/Linux software toolkits and
applications, including Mozilla. It is now possible to use
Mozilla's rendering engine (Gecko) instead of KHTML in Konqueror.
This can be set up at runtime in a config dialog and requires no
changes to Konqueror.</p><p>Eventually XParts will allow Linux and UNIX developers to
make KDE components&mdash;no matter which toolkits and software they
decide to utilize.</p></div></div>
