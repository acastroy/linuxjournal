Phonegap: the easy way to develop smartphone applications.

How many times have you heard, &ldquo;there's an app for that&rdquo;? But
sometimes, there actually isn't &ldquo;an app for that&rdquo;, or the apps that do
exist don't meet your needs. As Linux users, we tend to like to scratch
our own itches, and if that means we write some code to do it, so be
it. However, writing code to run on an Android phone or tablet has a bit
of a learning curve, and it's even worse on Apple products. Fortunately,
Phonegap provides a simple way to create standalone apps for Android,
iPhone, WebOS, Blackberry and Windows Phone, among others. You just need
to be reasonably proficient in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and you can
develop native apps for the majority of smartphones currently in use. And,
the same code base can run, with obvious limitations, on any Web browser.
</p><p>
Developing native code for Android is relatively easy. You'll have to
learn to use Android's XML-based screen layout mechanism, and you'll
have to learn Java. For iPhone, you'll need to learn Objective C. If
you want to develop for Windows Phone, you'll need to learn C# as
well. Instead, you simply could use Phonegap and maintain a singe code
base in HTML/JavaScript/CSS. This is the definition of a
&ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Before I go much further, I need to clear up a potential source of
confusion. Phonegap initially was developed by a company named Nitobi,
which subsequently was acquired by Adobe. In 2011, Nitobi/Adobe donated
the Phonegap code base to the Apache Foundation. As a result of this
contribution, they needed to ensure that the intellectual property was
unfettered by trademark ambiguity, so they renamed the Phonegap project
to Cordova. The Apache Foundation is in the process of migrating
from Phonegap to Cordova, so I refer to this project
as Cordova here.
</p><p>
Getting started with Cordova on Android isn't difficult. At the risk of
rehashing material that is well documented elsewhere, I'll just outline
the process involved. First, you have to install the Android SDK, which
is a free download from the Android site and is very well documented. The
Android SDK integrates with the Eclipse IDE, so you will need to have
a fairly recent version of Eclipse as well. The SDK documentation will
walk you through the whole process, from downloading the software to
building and running the sample application. The SDK lets you run your
program in an emulator or on a real Android device, if you have one.
</p><p>
Installing Cordova is also fairly straightforward and well documented. The
only difficulty I had with the entire process is that I wasn't very
familiar with Eclipse and stumbled a bit. The Cordova installation process
culminates with building and running the sample Cordova application. The
sample application demonstrates much of Cordova's API and is worth
looking at.
</p><p>
I found the process of creating a new Cordova project to be a bit kludgey.
The process involved creating a new Android project first, then making
a two-line modification to a Java program, pasting in a dozen lines of
XML into another file, and well, you get the idea. All of the changes made
sense, but seemed a bit error-prone. Finally, I decided to copy
the example project and strip it down to its bare necessities. This is
the approach that I recommend; it worked like a champ for me.
</p><p>
A Cordova application has three main pieces. There is an
architecture-specific binary piece that actually communicates directly
with the device's hardware. Then there is a Java-based abstraction
layer that sets up your application's runtime environment and presents
a JavaScript API for your application to use. The third part is your
HTML/JavaScript/CSS code, and this is the only part that you normally
need to be concerned with. All of these pieces get linked together
at build time to form a native binary executable for the target device.
</p><p>
The Cordova JavaScript API allows your program to access many of the host
device's sensors. This means that your application has easy access to the
device's GPS, accelerometer, compass, microphone and speaker. The API
provides persistent data storage by allowing access to the device's contact
database, its filesystem and a native SQLite database.
</p><p>
Let's look at some code.
</p><p>
For the sake of illustration, I developed a simple application. The
application is designed to demonstrate three main features: access to
the device's GPS sensor, access to the user's contacts and the ability
to make Ajax calls to remote Web services.
</p><p>
The HTML needed to create this application is pretty straightforward. See
Listing 1.

The content of the &lt;head&gt; section is mostly boilerplate. Note that
you import the cordova.js and then your main.js JavaScript files, and
that the order is important. In the &lt;body&gt;, you find a graphic that
you bring in from a remote server. Then you see input fields for your
current GPS coordinates. Next, you have some form fields that will
contain information from the phone's contact directory, followed by
Previous and Next buttons that allow users to scroll
through their contacts. Finally, there are two &lt;span&gt;s that will allow
the program to display witty comments from a remote Web site and any
error messages that might need to be displayed. Figure 1 shows what the
page looks like in a browser.

Line 1 is a simple boolean flag that determines whether the script is
running on a mobile device or a Web browser. Setting this variable
to 0 allows me to run and debug the program in Firefox where I have
all of the HTML, DOM and JavaScript development tools that I'm accustomed
to using. Setting this variable to 1 targets the program for a mobile
device where I can debug the Cordova-specific aspects of my program,
knowing that my JavaScript is probably correct.
</p><p>
Lines 91&ndash;95 arrange to have the JavaScript <tt  >init()</tt> function called
when the DOM is loaded and after the Cordova initialization routines
have run. These lines also point out a couple oddities about Cordova
development. First, there is no way to detect automatically whether
the program is running in a browser or on a smartphone. That's why I
set that variable, as discussed earlier. Also, Cordova creates its own
event that gets triggered when it's ready to begin JavaScript execution;
you can't use <tt  >window.onload</tt> as you normally would, because this event might
trigger before Cordova is ready. Either way, the <tt  >init()</tt> function will
be called at the appropriate time.
</p><p>
The <tt  >init()</tt> function is on lines 5&ndash;13. On line 8, you make a call to the
<tt  >contacts.find</tt> method to get an array of contact objects from the device's
contact directory. This array is then passed, asynchronously,
to <tt  >store_contacts()</tt>, lines 39&ndash;44, which simply stores the array in a global
variable. Then, <tt  >init()</tt> makes a call to
<tt  >update()</tt> to initialize the data
display and arranges for <tt  >update()</tt> to be called every second from then on.
</p><p>
The <tt  >update()</tt> function, lines 15&ndash;37, is where the fun begins. If the
program is running in a browser, you simply populate the Longitude
and Latitude fields with random numbers. Having the numbers
change like that allowed me to verify that the program was still
running. However, if the program is running on a physical device,
you use the <tt  >geolocation.getCurrentPosition</tt> method to fetch the real
GPS coordinates. If this operation is successful,
<tt  >set_location()</tt> is
called. Otherwise, <tt  >location_error()</tt> gets called, and you can display an
error message (lines 73&ndash;83). The only error I've encountered with the
<tt  >getCurrentPosition</tt> call was when I actually had the GPS disabled.
</p><p>
Lines 25&ndash;36 form an almost embarrassing Ajax call. I've stripped this
code down to the least amount of code that would run under Firefox
and Cordova. It won't run on IE, and it doesn't do much, if any,
error checking. I'm not trying to demonstrate <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to do an Ajax call
in Cordova. I'm only trying to demonstrate that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>. In this case,
you're loading some content from a remote server and putting it inside the
quote &lt;div&gt; discussed earlier. During development, I'd simply change the
content of that file on the server to verify that it changed inside the app.
</p><p>
Lines 44&ndash;58 are onclick handlers for the two buttons in the
application. All these routines do is adjust an array index plus or
minus one, as appropriate, and do some bounds checking. Finally, they
call <tt  >display_contact()</tt> to display the current contact.
</p><p>
The display_contact() function (lines 59&ndash;72) is the last of the
Cordova-specific functions in the program. In lines 60&ndash;64, you blank out all of
the contact fields in preparation for setting them with new values. I
found that if I didn't blank them out first, they would persist into
the next record if the next record didn't happen to have a value for
a given field. In lines 65&ndash;69, you populate the fields with data from
the current contact record. Note that both phoneNumbers and e-mails are
arrays of objects, and that for this purpose, you are interested
only in the first element.
</p><p>
And there you have it. There's nothing here that would be unfamiliar to
the average Web developer, except a really powerful API. But, I've only
touched on what this API can do. Figure 2 shows
the application running on my Droid Bionic.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11307f2.large.jpg"><img src="11307f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Sample Application Running on Android
</p></div></div><p>
I did some hand waving over a subtle problem with this application that
many JavaScript, particularly Ajax, developers have encountered. On
most browsers, your program can't load from one domain, and then load
content or code from another domain. However, this program is standalone
and needed to load content from a potentially arbitrary Web site. Cordova
handles this problem by &ldquo;whitelisting&rdquo; the domains from which an application
is allowed to fetch content. By default, all domains are blacklisted,
and, thus, all network access is disabled. A developer can whitelist
a domain by editing /res/xml/cordova.xml and following the examples
given for the &lt;access&gt; tag. This is a safe but elegant solution to a
potentially nasty problem.
</p><p>
Another interesting possibility is to have your application load all of its
HTML and JavaScript from a remote Web server. This easily can be done by
making a simple change to ./src/{projectname}/{projectname}.java. This file
has only 20 lines of real code, and the necessary change is pretty intuitive.
</p><p>
Being able to load content from a remote server actually makes development
easier. I found it easier to do my development on a remote, publicly
accessible server, than to develop on my workstation. This way, I could
point my Web browser at the application and get all my HTML, CSS and
JavaScript working the way I wanted. Then I got the application fully
functional on my Android. Once it was fully functional, I copied the
project to my workstation for the final build. Doing it this way is the
only way you'll be able to test an application that makes
any Ajax calls without violating your browser's cross-site scripting
security policy.
</p><p>
As neat as Cordova is, there are a few things I didn't like. As I
mentioned earlier, there is no way to detect automatically whether
a program is running in a browser or on a device. Also, I found the
whitelisting functionality to be a bit buggy, but not in any way that
broke my application. But, the most disheartening thing I found was when
I tried to use the camera API. Instead of simply snapping a picture and
either returning the data or storing it, the API actually brought up the
device's native camera device as a pop-up. This was extremely intrusive
and actually broke my first demonstration app.
</p><p>
I've had a lot of fun playing with Cordova, and I've barely scratched the
surface of what it can do or be extended to do. This has to be the
easiest way to get into smartphone application development.
