ROSA Desktop 2012</h2></div></div><p>
The fact that Russia's ROSA Labs once collaborated with Mandriva is evident
in the company's latest release, ROSA Desktop 2012. Nevertheless, since
breaking from Mandriva, ROSA Labs has forked the distro onto its own unique
development path. ROSA Desktop 2012 is an LSB-compliant distro that
features a customized KDE desktop. The free edition sports only free
software; the Extended Edition includes nonfree components and proprietary
software, such as codecs. ROSA Labs says that by developing ROSA Desktop 2012
with its own software development and build environment&mdash;ROSA
ABF&mdash;the company is able to achieve unmatched technological independence, high
quality and up to five years of technical support. Examples of new features
include EFI/UEFI support, improved hardware detection and improved
compatibility with Windows 8. Supported languages include English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian.

Wind River Intelligent Network Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The targets in the company's cross hairs for the recently introduced Wind
River Intelligent Network Platform are equipment providers who&mdash;in the
face of exploding traffic&mdash;are in need of powerful building blocks to help them
build faster, smarter and safer networks. The solution is designed to
deliver improved network intelligence, security and speed, and the
scalability to support the move to software-defined networking. Wind River
claims a 1100% improvement in IP-forwarding and up to a 500% improvement in
throughput for UDP and performance boost for TCP. Wind River Intelligent
Network Platform is composed of software that manages a consolidated
control and data plane system, as well as software engines that provide
fast packet acceleration and content inspection. Additional engines for
specialized needs, such as accelerated traffic flow-classification, will
follow. The platform comes configured with Wind River Linux and a
comprehensive suite of integrated development tools.

Digital Defense Inc.'s SecurED Training</h2></div></div><p>
For most employees, security is something they leave for folks like us to deal
with. With its new SecurED training modules, Digital Defense Inc. (DDI) is
employing the oldest trick in the book&mdash;humor&mdash;to get nongeeks
to realize the importance of collaborative enterprise security. DDI has
partnered with Emmy-award-winning comedy writer T. Sean Shannon to develop
training modules, each 5&ndash;7 minutes in length, that promote a culture of
security awareness. Humorous situations are used to maintain attention and
increase the &ldquo;stickiness factor&rdquo;. The modules can be accessed via a
PC, laptop, iPad/tablet or mobile device and are accessed through an
organization's LMS. Designed as a year-long program to be viewed monthly,
the 12 modules cover topics like password security, acceptable computer
use, safe browsing, dangers of social-media sites, preventing viruses and
malware and installing software from unknown sources.

Kyle Rankin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>DevOps Troubleshooting</em></span> (Addison-Wesley)</h2></div></div><p>
The best perk in working for a magazine is that shameless plugs are free. In
all seriousness, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers certainly will be interested to know
that our own Hack and / columnist, Kyle Rankin, has written a new book
titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>DevOps Troubleshooting: Linux Server Best
Practices</em></span>. The purpose
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>DevOps</em></span> is to give developers, QA and admins a common set of
troubleshooting skills and practices so they can collaborate
effectively to solve Linux server problems and improve IT performance,
availability and efficiency. Kyle walks readers through using DevOps
techniques to troubleshoot everything from boot failures and corrupt disks
to lost e-mail and downed Web sites. They'll also master indispensable
skills for diagnosing high-load systems and network problems in production
environments. Addison-Wesley Professional is the publisher (and royalty
provider) for DevOps. So, Kyle, about those royalties....

Wireload Inc.'s YippieMove API</h2></div></div><p>
With the release of the new YippieMove API, Wireload Inc.'s YippieMove is
upgrading itself from e-mail migration service to e-mail migration solution
provider. Since its inception, YippieMove has been actively slaying the
beasts involved in moving e-mail history between different e-mail vendors.
With the release of the YippieMove API, YippieMove is aiming to become the
go-to e-mail migration service for vendors to integrate with. The move opens
up a new market for third-party software developers and enables e-mail
vendors and ISPs to create fully automatic inbound e-mail migrations for new
accounts. Vendors or ISPs potentially could add a simple step to their
sign-up process that would enable users to bring over their e-mail archives
from any provider or solution to the newly created account in just a few
clicks. The custom-built technology has been built from scratch and
perfected by YippieMove during the past four years.

Jason R. Briggs' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python for Kids</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Veteran programmer Jason R. Briggs' inaugural venture into book publishing,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming</em></span>, aims to inspire the
same love of computing that he experienced decades ago hacking his Radio
Shack TRS-80. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python for Kids</em></span>, published by No Starch Press, is a
lighthearted introduction to the Python programming language, full of fun
examples and original color illustrations. Briggs begins the book with the
basics of how to install Python and write simple commands. In bite-sized
chapters, he explains essential programming concepts. By the end of the
book, readers have built simple games and created cool drawings with
Python's graphics library, Turtle. Each chapter closes with offbeat
exercises that challenge readers to put their newly acquired knowledge
to the test.

STEC Inc.'s Linux-Based SSD Solutions</h2></div></div><p>
We Linuxers always are happy to see new vendors embrace the Linux and
open-source paradigm. STEC Inc. is also finding much more to like than it
ever imagined after recently developing Linux drivers for its PCI
Express-based solid-state drives. STEC reports that coupling the new
open-source Linux with the company's high-performance s1120 PCIe
Accelerator SSD card dramatically broadens the range of applications for
the device. Furthermore, the combination results in &ldquo;very promising
performance results never seen
before&rdquo;, such as a boost to Oracle application performance to more than
160,000 transactions per minute. Other improvements include an improvement
in application response times by maximizing I/Os per second on a single
server and a lower TCO by reducing data-center operational and capital
expenditures.

txtr beagle</h2></div></div><p>
If you are an e-book fan in North America, Kindles or NOOKs probably
are the among the first devices that come to mind. If the Berlin-based txtr has
its way, however, you soon may find yourself reading e-books on the
company's new beagle e-book reader. The txtr beagle, with its 5"
screen, 1/4" profile and 4.5oz weight, is billed as the smallest and
lightest e-book reader on the market. txtr says the beagle will run
for a year on AAA batteries and does not require cables or chargers. It is
the first companion reader to receive e-books sent from a smartphone, says
the device developer. The Android-based txtr beagle is 
part of the overall Adobe-certified txtr eReading platform, but does not
count as an extra device. txtr believes that these characteristics, as well
as a price point for telecom providers potentially as low as $13.00, are
the raw materials for a truly global, mass-market e-book reader.
