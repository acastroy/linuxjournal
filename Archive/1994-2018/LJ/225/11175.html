Do you have an old, unused wireless router collecting
dust? Have some fun and make a Wi-Fi honeypot with it!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d1580.0x17c91f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I've been playing with some new wireless gear. It's nothing special: 200mW
Atheros-based transceiver and 18dBi yagi antenna. I'm living in an
apartment in a city of about 640,000 people. I've pointed the antenna to
a window and passively received about 30 wireless ESSIDs, three of which
were unsecured (open) and six secured with WEP (easily crackable). I
haven't connected to any of them, of course, but that gave me some ideas.
</p><p>
What if I deployed a wireless access point deliberately open? Some people
eventually will connect and try to use it for Internet access&mdash;some might be
malicious, and 
some might think that it's a hotspot. And, what if I deployed a similar
access point, but secured with easily crackable WEP this time? Well, in my
humble opinion, it's not possible to unconsciously crack WEP. If somebody
that I don't know connects to this AP, I've just been attacked. All I need
to do is to monitor.
</p><p>
That's exactly a wireless honeypot: fake access point, deliberately
unsecured or poorly secured and monitored, so you can get as much
information about attackers as you want. Such honeypots are especially
useful in large networks as early threat indicators, but you
also can play with them on your home network, just for fun and research.
</p><p>
You can build a wireless honeypot with old hardware, some spare time and,
of course, a Linux-based solution. OpenWrt (<a href="https://openwrt.org" target="_self">https://openwrt.org</a>) and DD-WRT
(<a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index" target="_self">www.dd-wrt.com/site/index</a>)
are the two most popular Linux-based firmware projects for routers. I
use them and some old spare routers in this article to show you how to build three kinds of honeypots:
a very basic one that logs only information about packets sent by users into
its memory, a little more sophisticated one with USB storage that logs a
few more details about malicious clients to the storage, and finally,
a solution that redirects HTTP traffic through a proxy that not
only can log, but also interfere with communication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d1580.0x17c9568"></a>
Basic Honeypot with DD-WRT</h2></div></div><p>
Building a very basic wireless honeypot shouldn't take you more than an
hour or two. Just grab your old router and pick up the firmware. Be sure
to look at supported routers for both DD-WRT and OpenWrt. In my case, it
came up that the router is supported only by DD-WRT, as it has 32MB of RAM
and 4MB of Flash memory. OpenWrt's hardware requirements are a little bigger.
</p><p>
Next, flash your router (that's the risky part). Basically, you need to
download the firmware for your machine and upload it to the memory. On
some routers, it's as easy as clicking a button on the Web interface. On
others, you have to connect through a serial cable, for example. Remember,
this step can be dangerous. Make a backup first and be sure to 
read the instructions carefully on the DD-WRT/OpenWrt sites.
</p><p>
After successfully flashing your router, you should see an enhanced (as
compared to the original one) Web interface. Now, set up SSH access and
wireless network parameters. If you don't know how, you can find detailed
instructions on the DD-WRT home page. As it is going to be a honeypot,
I would suggest WEP, which should attract potential attackers. At the
same time, it won't be so vulnerable to false positives&mdash;people with
devices automatically connecting to an open network.
</p><p>
If you can log in as root and see the prompt, you're ready for the next
step: enabling system logging. You can do this using the Web interface:
Services&rarr;Services&rarr;System Log and Security&rarr;Log Enable (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11175f1.large.jpg"><img src="11175f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Enabling System Logging
</p></div></div><p>
You also can set a few ESSIDs instead of just one: Wireless&rarr;Basic
Settings&rarr;Virtual Interfaces. After that, your honeypot will be seen
as a few networks&mdash;at least at first glance. This increases the
probability of attacks, especially when there are many other networks
in your neighborhood.
</p><p>
Remember, you don't have to connect your honeypot to the Internet. In
fact, you shouldn't, as you have no control of what potential users might
do with the Internet access. After configuring it as described above, test whether
it logs your connections. DD-WRT writes the log in /var/log/messages by
default. You can check it using SSH. Here's an example fragment of such a log:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  1 00:43:03 orange user.warn kernel: ACCEPT IN=br0 
 &#8618;OUT= MAC=00:26:5a:a1:bc:86:00:0c:f1:11:43:0e:08:00 
 &#8618;SRC=192.168.2.2 DST=192.168.2.1 LEN=84 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 
 &#8618;TTL=64 ID=0 DF PROTO=ICMP TYPE=8 CODE=0 ID=22535 SEQ=1 
Jan  1 00:43:04 orange user.warn kernel: ACCEPT IN=br0 
 &#8618;OUT= MAC=00:26:5a:a1:bc:86:00:0c:f1:11:43:0e:08:00 
 &#8618;SRC=192.168.2.2 DST=192.168.2.1 LEN=84 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 
 &#8618;TTL=64 ID=0 DF PROTO=ICMP TYPE=8 CODE=0 ID=22535 SEQ=2 
</pre>
</p><p>
If you can see your packet info logged, just leave the router and wait,
looking at the log from time to time.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, with such small resources, you can't do much more&mdash;at
least within a few hours. This basic honeypot would log only packet
headers, IPs and MAC addresses. You can see how a ping command is logged
in the previous example. Generally, all the information you can collect is when
somebody with a specified MAC and IP try to use your network&mdash;that's not much.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d1580.0x17c9b98"></a>
Logging Associations to USB Storage with OpenWrt</h2></div></div><p>
You can build a little more-advanced wireless honeypot with
OpenWrt. Using it, you'll be able to log not only packets, MAC addresses
and IP addresses, but also wireless associations, authentications,
disassociations, deauthentications and timestamps. With a little effort,
you also can expand your honeypot logging capabilities to use USB
storage&mdash;that gives you a lot more space for logs.
</p><p>
My second router has 32MB of RAM, 8MB of Flash memory and USB support. On such
hardware, you easily can install OpenWrt in a similar way as DD-WRT.
Detailed instructions are available on the OpenWrt site.
After installing it,
setting up a wireless access point and logging in via SSH as root, you
need to install a few more packages.
</p><p>
First, you'll need USB storage support:

<pre     class="programlisting">
opkg update
opkg install kmod-usb-ohci
opkg install kmod-usb2
insmod usb-ohci
insmod usbcore
insmod ehci-hcd
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, after connecting a pendrive, <tt  >dmesg</tt> should show it to you, for
example, as /dev/sda. Make a directory for mounting your storage: <tt  >mkdir
/storage</tt>. Then mount it: <tt  >mount /dev/sda1
/storage</tt>. You'll use it later
for gathered data.
</p><p>
Next, you must decide what traffic to log. Let's assume you want to
log all traffic forwarded by the router. To do this, use netfilter and
iptables (<a href="http://www.netfilter.org" target="_self">www.netfilter.org</a>): <tt  >iptables -I FORWARD
-j LOG</tt>, just as you would do in
a typical Linux distribution.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows an example fragment of a log stored on the pendrive. It
was generated by the user associating, authenticating, requesting IP
through DHCP and connecting to google.pl:80.

This honeypot is a little more advanced, although you still don't have much
control over user activity on the Internet. You either shouldn't connect
the router to the Internet, filter the traffic with iptables and/or set
up a proxy between your router and the Internet. Or, you can set up a
proxy on your router!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d1580.0x17ca380"></a>
OpenWrt and Tinyproxy</h2></div></div><p>
If your machine has enough resources, you can go one step further and use
a proxy on your router. With this, you will be able to monitor, filter and
modify HTTP traffic. Squid is an example of full-blown proxy solution. If
you have a router that is capable of running it, go ahead. If you (like me)
don't, you'll have to stick with a solution with fewer requirements. An
example of such a solution is tinyproxy. To install tinyproxy in your OpenWrt, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
opkg update
opkg install tinyproxy luci-app-tinyproxy
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, configure and run it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uci set tinyproxy.@tinyproxy[0].enable=1
uci commit
/etc/init.d/tinyproxy enable
/etc/init.d/tinyproxy restart
</pre>
</p><p>
From now on, your tinyproxy should listen by default on port 8888 on
your localhost. You can check this with the <tt  >netstat</tt> command. Since you want
to accept connections not only from localhost, but also from LAN, you'll
have to change the configuration a little bit. Also, in our case, it's
better to run it in so-called stealth mode&mdash;that means no added headers
in HTTP. You can find the tinyproxy configuration in the /etc/config/tinyproxy
file. Listing 2 shows an example of such a configuration. Notice that
logfile is specified to be in the /storage directory, which is our
pendrive. Another important option is <tt  >list 'Allow'</tt>. These are the
IPs that are allowed to connect to the tinyproxy. You should specify
your LAN network or a part of it.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d1580.0x17ca748"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

        option 'enable' '1'
</pre></div><p>
Tinyproxy also lets you filter requests by domain. You can specify a
blacklist or a whitelist of domains in the Filter file. In our configuration,
this is <tt  >'/storage/filter'</tt> Also, here we notify tinyproxy to treat this
file as a whitelist (<tt  >FilterDefaultDeny 1</tt>), meaning that
requests only
for specified domains will be allowed. That way, you can forbid
attackers from accessing the Internet with their browsers or let them access
only specified domains. An example of a /storage/filter file could be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
linuxjournal.com
</pre>
</p><p>
That would let them visit only the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that this will block only HTTP requests; all the other
traffic will be allowed if you haven't blocked it elsewhere.
</p><p>
Finally, you must tell your router to forward all HTTP traffic to your
new proxy. As usual, you can do this with iptables, but first you need
to install the iptables-mod-nat-extra package:


<pre     class="programlisting">
opkg install iptables-mod-nat-extra
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --destination-port 80 
 &#8618;-j REDIRECT --to-port 8888
</pre>
</p><p>
From now on, all HTTP requests should be forwarded through tinyproxy
and logged to /storage/tinyproxy.log. Listing 3 shows a fragment of such
a log. You can see what connections the user tried to make and what has been
filtered by the proxy.

When tinyproxy filters a connection request, it displays an
information page describing what happened. You also can make
use of this to hide tinyproxy's presence or to inform or
deceive your attackers (or make a joke). The Web site template is in
/usr/share/tinyproxy/default.html. You can see a slightly modified
version of this in Listing 4 and Figure 2. This doesn't tell users
about tinyproxy and the reason for seeing this page; instead, it politely informs
them that they shouldn't use this network for Internet access.

Go with the Evolution</h2></div></div><p>
The next step in the evolution would be a full-blown wireless
honeypot. You can make one using a machine that can run a typical Linux
distribution. Then install, for example, dionaea
(<a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it" target="_self">dionaea.carnivore.it</a>), use a
wireless card configured to run as an access point and forward all traffic
to your localhost, on which the attacker will see fake services.
</p><p>
Remember, if you want a really good honeypot, make sure that it
looks as close as possible to reality. That means, for example,
that you might use some dummy clients just to simulate traffic. Or, use
WPA instead of WEP. It all depends on your environment.
</p><p>
Also, it is important to be familiar with your country's laws. Make sure
it's not prohibited to sniff your attackers' data. Think about whether it's wise to
make an Internet connection available for them. Maybe it would be better
not to connect your router's WAN port to anything at all, connect it to
your machine simulating the Internet or connect it to the Internet but
filter the traffic with iptables?
</p><p>
Finally, don't be discouraged by the DD-WRT or OpenWrt systems. They are
based on Linux and are very similar in use, but because of the small resources
available, they're stripped down. There are no manual pages and slightly different
utilities that you may know from you Linux distribution, even though they are named
