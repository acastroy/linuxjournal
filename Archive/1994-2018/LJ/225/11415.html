Want to send messages to all the browsers connected to your site? The pub-sub
paradigm, run through Web sockets, might be just the solution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249c580.0x2594358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in the 1980s, BSD UNIX introduced the idea of a &ldquo;socket&rdquo;, a data
structure that functioned similarly to a file handle, in that you
could read from it or write to it. But, whereas a file handle allows a
program to work with a file, a socket is connected to another
process&mdash;perhaps on the same computer, but quite possibly running on another
one, somewhere else on the Internet. Sockets brought about a
communications revolution, in no small part because they made it easy
to write programs that communicated across the network.
</p><p>
Today, we take that for granted. Dozens or hundreds of sockets are
open on my computer at any given moment, and I don't know if they're
communicating with local or remote programs. But, that's just the
point&mdash;it's so easy to work with sockets, we no longer think of
networked programs as anything special or unusual. The people who
created sockets couldn't possibly have imagined the wide variety of
protocols, applications and businesses that were built using their
invention.
</p><p>
My point is not to praise sockets, but to point out that the inventors
of a technology, particularly one that provides infrastructural
support and a new abstraction layer, cannot know in advance how it'll
be used.
</p><p>
In that light, consider a new network communication protocol called
Web sockets, part of the standards known collectively as HTML5.
To me, at least, Web sockets are the most undersold, least discussed
parts of the HTML5 suite, with the potential to transform Web browsers
into a fully fledged application platform.
</p><p>
Web sockets don't replace HTTP. Rather, much like BSD sockets, they
provide bidirectional, long-term communication between two
computers.
The &ldquo;bidirectional&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; aspects distinguish Web sockets
from HTTP, in which the client sends a request, the server sends a
response, and then the connection is terminated. Setting up a Web
socket has very little overhead&mdash;and once communication is
established, it can continue indefinitely.
</p><p>
Now that Web sockets exist, and are even supported by a growing number
of browsers, what can you do with them? That question is still
hard to answer, in no small part because Web sockets are so new.
After all, if you had asked someone in the 1980s what you could do
with BSD sockets, it's unlikely that streaming video would have come
to mind.
</p><p>
That said, there are some applications for which Web sockets are
already showing their advantage. In particular, applications that
benefit from real-time data updates, such as stock-market tickers, 
now can receive a steady stream of data, rather than perform repeated
Ajax calls to a server. Real-time chat systems are another example of
where Web sockets can shine, and where HTTP has not performed
adequately. Indeed, any Web application that handles or displays a
constant flow of data can benefit from Web sockets.
</p><p>
But you can go even farther than that. Remember, Web sockets provide
communication between a single server and a single client. There are,
however, numerous applications in which the server might want to
&ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; information to a large number of clients simultaneously.
You can imagine how this could work with Web sockets, creating a Web
socket connection between a server and each of the clients, and then
sending messages to each of the clients, perhaps by iterating over the
array of Web sockets and invoking send() on each one.
</p><p>
This is certainly possible, but implementing such a system yourself
would be time-consuming and difficult, and might not scale easily.
Fortunately, now there are third-party services that (for a fee) will
handle such connections for you. Such publish-subscribe
(&ldquo;pub-sub&rdquo;)
systems make it possible for a server to send to any number of clients
almost simultaneously, opening the door to all sorts of Web
applications.
</p><p>
In this article, I review the basics behind Web sockets and then move
forward to demonstrate a simple application that uses the pub-sub
paradigm. Even if you don't currently need this sort of functionality
in your Web application, I have no doubt you'll eventually
encounter a situation that can benefit from it. When the time comes,
you'll hopefully realize that it's not too difficult to put it into
place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249c580.0x2594a38"></a>
Working with Web Sockets</h2></div></div><p>
Web sockets, as with the rest of the HTML5 standard, have to do with
programming within the browser&mdash;which, of course, happens in
JavaScript or a language that compiles into JavaScript. To create a
new Web socket, you simply say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var ws = new WebSocket("ws://lerner.co.il/socket");
</pre>
</p><p>
The beauty of this API is its simplicity. I don't know about you, but
I'm tired of protocols that expect me to remember which parameter
represents the hostname, which the protocol and which the port (if
any). In the case of Web sockets, as you would expect from a Web
standard, you pass all of that along in a URL whose protocol is defined
as &ldquo;ws&rdquo; or &ldquo;wss&rdquo; (for SSL-encrypted Web sockets).
Also notice that you
don't have to define the Web socket as being read-only, write-only or
read/write; Web sockets are all bidirectional.
</p><p>
You can send data to the other side of your Web socket by invoking the
&ldquo;send&rdquo; method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ws.send("Hello");
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if you want to send something a bit more complicated, it's
typical to use JSON:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var stuff_to_send = {a:1, b:2};
ws.send(JSON.stringify(stuff_to_send));
</pre>
</p><p>
What happens when your Web socket receives some data? Nothing just
yet. You have to tell the browser that each time it receives data, it
should do something with that data, such as display it on the screen.
You tell it what to do with a callback, as you might expect in a
functional language, such as JavaScript. That is, you tell the Web
socket that when it receives data, it should execute a function,
passing the received data as a parameter to that function. A simple
example might be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ws.onmessage = function(message) {
    alert("Received ws message: '" + message.data + '"');
};
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can do something more interesting and exciting with the data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ws.onmessage = function(message) {
    $("#wsdata").html(message.data);
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, the incoming data isn't necessarily a string. Instead, it might
be a bunch of JSON, in which case, it might contain a
JavaScript object with fields. In such a case, you could say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ws.onmessage = function(message) {
    parsed_message = JSON.parse(message)
    $("#one").html(parsed_message.one);
    $("#one").html(parsed_message.two);
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, it's important to remember that the Web sockets protocol is a
distinct protocol from HTTP. This means that when I say I want
to connect to ws://lerner.co.il/socket, I need to be sure I'm
running a Web socket server on lerner.co.il that responds to items at
that URL. This is not the same thing as Apache, nginx or whatever
your favorite HTTP server is.
</p><p>
So, when I say here that your browser connects to a server, you need to
provide such a server. The Resources section of this article describes a number of
systems that make it possible and fairly straightforward
to create a server for Web sockets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249c580.0x25951c8"></a>
Pub-Sub</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, working with Web sockets is fairly straightforward.
But, what happens if you want to send messages to multiple clients? For
example, let's say your company deals with stocks, and you want
the home page of your company's Web site to show the latest
value of certain stocks and stock indexes, updated continuously.
</p><p>
The simplest and seemingly most straightforward way is to use the strategy
I described above&mdash;namely, that the server can store its Web
sockets in an array (or similar data structure). At a set interval,
the server then can execute <tt  >ws.send()</tt> to each of the clients, either
sending a simple text string or a JSON data structure with one or more
pieces of information. The client, upon receiving this data, then
executes the <tt  >onmessage</tt> callback function, which then updates the
user's browser accordingly.
</p><p>
This approach has a number of problems,
but the main one
that bothers me is the lack of a real abstraction layer. As
application developers, you want to send the message, rather than
consider how the message is being sent, or even who is receiving it.
This is one way of looking at the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) design
pattern. The publisher and subscriber aren't connected to each other
directly, but rather through a middleman object or server that takes
care of the connections. When the publisher wants to send a message,
it does so through the broker, which then uses the existing Web socket
connection to send a message to each client.
</p><p>
Now, this might sound something like a message queue, which I
described about a year ago in this space. But message queues and
pub-sub systems work quite differently from each other, and they are used
for different purposes.
</p><p>
You can think of a message queue as working something like e-mail,
with a single sender and a single recipient. Until the recipient
retrieves the message, it waits in the message queue. The order and
timing in which messages appear isn't necessarily guaranteed, but the
delivery of the message is.
</p><p>
By contrast, a pub-sub system is something like a group IM chat.
Everyone who is connected to the pub-sub system and is subscribing to
a particular channel, receives the messages sent to that channel. If
you happen not to be subscribed at the time a message is sent,
you won't receive it; there is no mechanism in pub-sub for storing or
replaying messages.
</p><p>
If you were interested in giving people real-time stock updates from
your home page, the pub-sub way of doing that would be to have each
client register itself as a subscriber with the pub-sub server. The
server then would send new messages at regular intervals to the
pub-sub server, which would pass them along to the appropriate
clients. Remember, in a pub-sub system, the publisher doesn't
know how many subscribers there are or when they enter/leave the
system. All the publisher needs to know is the API for sending data
to the pub-sub server, which passes things along to the appropriate
clients.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249c580.0x2595590"></a>
Implementing Pub-Sub</h2></div></div><p>
Pub-sub has long existed outside the Web and is a fairly standard
architecture for &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; information to a variety of clients.
And, you can create a pub-sub system on your own, but there are at
least two commercial services&mdash;Pusher and PubNub are the best
known&mdash;that make it trivially easy to implement real-time messaging
within your Web application. Pusher uses Web sockets, substituting a
Flash-based solution when a browser doesn't support them. PubNub uses
a different system, known as &ldquo;HTTP long polling&rdquo;, which avoids the
problem of browser support for Web sockets. Both are worth
consideration if you're looking for a commercial pub-sub service, but
I use Pusher here (as well as in my own consulting work),
partly because I prefer to use Web sockets, and partly because Pusher
lets you tag each message with an event type, giving you a richer
mechanism for sending data.
</p><p>
Because Pusher is a commercial service, you need to register with it
before you can use it. It has a free &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; system that is
more than viable for systems in development. Once you go beyond its
limits of 20 connections and 100,000 messages per day, you need to
pay a monthly fee. After signing up with Pusher, you need three
pieces of information to implement the application:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A key: this is the equivalent of your user name. It's used by the
publisher to send messages and by the client to retrieve messages.
This cannot be a secret, because it'll be in the HTML files that
your users display in their browsers.
</p></li><li><p>
A secret: the equivalent of a password. This will not be used on
the client, or subscriber, side of things. But, it will be used on
the server (publisher) side, which is sending data to the client.
This ensures that only you are sending data.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, each application that you use with Pusher has its own
application ID, a unique numeric code. If you have different
applications running with Pusher, you need to register for
additional application IDs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have those three pieces of information, you can begin to create
your Web application. The simple application that you'll create here is
a Web page that displays the latest information about a particular
stock. Which stock? Whichever one the publisher has decided to show
you. Such updates, of stock names and values, will be sent to your
browser via pub-sub, letting you update the page without needing a
refresh or any input from the user.
</p><p>
To get this all to work, you'll need an application in three parts. To
start off with, let's create a trivially simple Web application using
the Ruby-based Sinatra framework. Here is the entire application,
which I put in a file named stock.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "sinatra"
require 'erb'

get "/" do
  erb :index
end
</pre>
</p><p>
This program says that the Web application responds to GET requests on
the / URL, and nothing more. Requests for any other URLs, or with any
other methods, will be met with errors. If you are asked to display
the / URL, you'll display the ERb (embedded Ruby) file, named
views/index.erb. You can start your Web application by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./stock.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
On my system, I get the following response:

<pre     class="programlisting">
== Sinatra/1.3.3 has taken the stage on 4567 
 &#8618;for development with backup from Thin
&gt;&gt; Thin web server (v1.5.0 codename Knife)
&gt;&gt; Maximum connections set to 1024
&gt;&gt; Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567, CTRL+C to stop
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, if I now make a request for http://localhost:4567/,
I'll get an error, because the template is not in place. Creating a
subdirectory named &ldquo;views&rdquo;, I then can create the file index.erb
within it, which is shown in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249c580.0x298e078"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. index.erb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;!-- -*-html-*- --&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Stock Market&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
&#8618;jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js"
&#8618;type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="http://js.pusher.com/1.12/pusher.min.js"
&#8618;type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     var pusher = new Pusher('KEY_FROM_PUSHER');

    var channel = pusher.subscribe('stock_ticker');
    channel.bind('update_event', function(data) {

    $("#name").html(data['name']);
    $("#price").html(data['price']);

    });
  &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Stock Market&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Current value of &lt;span id="name"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt; is 
 &#8618;&lt;span id="price"&gt;PRICE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, index.erb is a simple HTML file. Its body consists of
a headline and a single paragraph:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;p&gt;Current value of &lt;span id="name"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt; is 
 &#8618;&lt;span id="price"&gt;PRICE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above line is the primitive stock ticker. When your publishing
system will send a new stock name and price, you will update this line
to reflect that message.
</p><p>
Just as you used a callback to handle incoming messages on your Web
socket, you also will need to define a callback to handle messages sent
by the publisher to your Pusher &ldquo;channel&rdquo;, as it is known. (Each
application can have any number of channels, and each channel can have
any number of events. This allows you to distinguish between
different types of messages, even within the same application.)
</p><p>
In order to do this, you need to load the JavaScript library (from
pusher.com), and then create a new Pusher object with the key of the
account you have created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var pusher = new Pusher('cc06430d9bb986ef7054');
</pre>
</p><p>
You then indicate that you want to subscribe to a particular channel,
the name of which does not need to be set in advance:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var channel = pusher.subscribe('stock_ticker');
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you define a callback function, indicating that when you
receive a message of type &ldquo;update_event&rdquo; on the stock_ticker channel,
you want to replace the HTML in the body of this document:

<pre     class="programlisting">
channel.bind('update_event', function(data) {
    $("#name").html(data['name']);
    $("#price").html(data['price']);
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I'm using jQuery here in order to replace the HTML on
the page. In order for that to work, I've also brought in the jQuery
library, downloading it from Google's servers.
</p><p>
With this HTML page in place, and my Sinatra application running, I'm
now ready to receive messages. I run the Sinatra application and
point my browser to localhost:4567. I should see the static version
of the page, with NAME and PRICE in the paragraph.
</p><p>
Publishing a message is almost as easy as receiving one. Different
applications will have different use cases. Sometimes, you will want
to send a message from the Web application itself, indicating that a
new message has been posted to a forum or that the number of
signed-in users has changed. In other cases, you'll want these
updates to come from an external process&mdash;perhaps one that is
running via cron or is monitoring the database separately from the
Web application.
</p><p>
For this particular example, I wrote a small Ruby program,
update-stocks.rb, which is shown in Listing 2. This program uses the
&ldquo;pusher&rdquo; gem, provided free of charge by the Pusher people.
You then
choose one of the companies in your list (the constant array
COMPANIES), then choose a random number up to 100. Next, you send
the message to all of the subscribers on the &ldquo;stock_ticker&rdquo; channel,
indicating that you've sent an &ldquo;update_event&rdquo;. Because of the
decoupled nature of communication between publisher and subscriber, you
won't get an error message if you misspell the channel or event name.
Rather, the message will be delivered to no one. Thus, you will want
to be particularly careful when writing these and ensure that the
same names are used in your client and your server.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Web sockets are going to change the Web dramatically, but it's not yet
clear how or when. Being able to update a large number of client
displays almost simultaneously using pub-sub is already changing the
way people see Web apps&mdash;and as you can see from this small
example application, it isn't very difficult to do. Pub-sub isn't
appropriate for all applications, but if you are sending the same data
to many people, and if they might want to receive updates
automatically into their browsers, this is an easy and
straightforward way to do it.

You can learn about Web sockets from a variety of sources. The W3C's
API and definition are at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-websockets-20090423" target="_self">www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-websockets-20090423</a>, in a document that
is surprisingly readable. Another good source of information is 
the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming HTML5 Applications</em></span> written by my colleague
Zach Kessin and published by O'Reilly.
</p><p>
Web socket servers have been written in nearly every language you
can imagine. I found a relatively up-to-date list, with links, on
Wikipedia, under the &ldquo;Web socket&rdquo; entry, and thus, I'll not try to
reproduce it here.
