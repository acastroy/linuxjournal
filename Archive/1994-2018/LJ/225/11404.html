Backblaze?</h4><p>
Regarding Doc Searls' &ldquo;Heavy Backup Weather&rdquo; in the October
2012 issue: wait, you use Backblaze? They don't offer Linux support. I'd rather not
see references to services that are not available to me. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Josh   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> You have a good point, and I'm sorry I didn't think
about that before I wrote the piece.
</p><p>
We've wanted to put together some kind of backup that would work for both
our Linux and Mac boxes, and for all three of our places (two temporary
apartments and one house), as well as on the road. I've used Backblaze for
my Mac laptop. I'll drop it.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, recommendations for backing up anything from any OS (starting
with Linux), anywhere, over the Net, would be welcome.

Excellent Python Article</h4><p>
I just wanted to send complements and thanks for the excellent article
&ldquo;Python Scripts as a Replacement for Bash Utility Scripts&rdquo; by Richard
Delaney in the November 2012 issue. He nailed it: good background,
reasoning
and explanations, well-chosen examples and clearly written sample code
(the latter two often are disappointments in otherwise good articles about
coding).
</p><p>
My only complaint is that I did have to print the article to paper to read it,
as my old-geek eyes could not make out the sub-7-point light-blue font used
in the e-version.
</p><p>
Python is currently one of my two favorite programming languages. The
other is Ruby. As I read Delaney's article, it occurred to me that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> could
actually get two-fer-one mileage out of his contribution simply by doing a
global search and replace of &ldquo;Python&rdquo; with &ldquo;Ruby&rdquo;, plus a small number of
trivial changes to vocabulary and library references&mdash;with, of course,
sample code in Ruby rather than Python. Voil&agrave;! A whole new, second
article! (Might I get co-authorship credit for this edit if/when you publish
it?)
</p><p>
My point is that there is practically complete functional equivalence between
the two languages (pax, fellow aficionados/purists of either!), especially
in this particular domain of Bash-replacement utility scripts. Ruby too
has a very large and capable library, both standard and gems, for dealing
with exactly the same kinds of problems that Delaney covers so well. For
example, Ruby also includes a powerful OptionParser module
(&ldquo;optparse&rdquo;) for
handling command-line switches and arguments easily and generally. I know, I'm developing a large and ever-growing repertory of Ruby utility scripts,
many of which are replacements and improvements of older Bash
versions&mdash;the Ruby versions are much more readable, understandable, maintainable and
expandable.
</p><p>
Either is an excellent choice in this domain. Ruby just happens to be my
personal favorite, but others may prefer Python. Your mileage may vary, and I'm not trying
to start a language flame war here. Interested readers may want to read
David Bryant Copeland's excellent book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build Awesome Command-Line
Applications in Ruby: Control Your Computer, Simplify Your Life</em></span> (2012,
Pragmatic Bookshelf), which explores this application domain in detail. He
also covers and recommends &ldquo;optparse&rdquo; (OptionParser) to build truly
powerful command-line utility apps.
</p><p>
With both Ruby and Python bulwarking good-old Bash, Long Live the Command
Line! Thanks again.

<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Delaney replies:</b></span>
Thank you very much for your letter. I think you bring up a brilliant
point, and having had little real experience with Ruby, I can only take
your word for it. Python and Ruby fill a very similar void in what they
hope to achieve and make any &ldquo;flame wars&rdquo; between the two communities all
the more illogical.
</p><p>
As you prefer Ruby, my preference is for Python, but only because I 
program with Python on a daily basis. The reality is that a number of
these beautifully crafted languages, such as Python and Ruby, are almost
drop-in replacements for one another. The interpreted, dynamic nature of both
these languages along with other advantages, such as an REPL, makes their
choice as a Bash replacement all the more enticing.
</p><p>
While selecting your language of choice for such things, it's also important
not to ignore some of the more modern compiled languages. Slightly more
abstract languages like Haskell provide a very elegant way to write
programs, as well as the relative newcomer Go. Aspects like program
readability, knowledge of the language and documentation often are more
important traits for a programmer than the language itself.
Thanks again for your kind words.

More Feedback on Richard Delaney's Python Article</h4><p>
I am enjoying reading the November issue and enjoyed the article by
Richard Delaney on using Python as a replacement/alternative for writing
shell scripts. I wanted to pass on some comments on the same.
</p><p>
The idea resonates with me. Of late, I have resorted to writing Python
scripts to perform tasks that usually would be done using shell
scripts. My personal reason is that I am not good at Bash scripting and
find all the $s and !s to quite cryptic. However, I feel that whereas
that may be the main reason for me, it's actually a good thing, because
I can implement what I have in mind really quickly, as I know
Python well. For example, say I need to search across a huge code base for
certain strings, and I want the paths of filenames where the strings
occur. I used to try doing it using cat, grep and find, but usually the
result turned out to be something I didn't like, or I had to search on
the Web for solutions. So, I just wrote a Python script to do the job
for me (<a href="https://gist.github.com/3759263" target="_self">https://gist.github.com/3759263</a>). I have been using
it ever since, and I am quite happy with
it. Bash experts may replace my whole program by a single line, but I
am not one of them, and I don't always like to search for solutions for
which I know the logic, but am constrained by my lack of Bash
scripting knowledge to implement the solution.
</p><p>
Thanks for your article. It was a good read. I would like to point
you to docopt (<a href="http://docopt.org" target="_self">docopt.org</a>), if you haven't heard of
it. It's pretty amazing.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Amit   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Delaney replies:</b></span> Thank you very
much for your letter. Feedback is always great to hear. I really
enjoyed reading your solution to common everyday scripting needs.
Often, the easiest way to overcome problems is to write from the ground up in
Python what you want. It has the advantage of being very expressive, and
you don't need to waste time due to unfamiliarity with certain tools or wrangling with
Bash's strange syntax. 
</p><p>
However, I really would recommend trying to grapple with some of the real
GNU utilities when you get time. Tools like cat, head and tail
can be very powerful if you spend any amount of time processing
files. They allow you to sample parts of files very easily among a host of
other things. Often its easier when you know how to use commands such as
these to combine them with a meatier Python script that does the heavy
lifting and leaves the simple utilities to the GNU utilities. This has many
advantages, such as having decade-tested tools at your disposable, which are
the quickest they can be at what they do. The UNIX philosophy of &ldquo;do one
thing well&rdquo; doesn't translate to every problem, but in this case, I find it
is at its most powerful.
</p><p>
PS. Thanks for recommending docopt. I will be looking into it
for new projects.

More-Advanced Articles?</h4><p>
Is it possible to get more in-depth articles in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>?
Everyone that reads this magazine is super smart. I know you don't know
what your readers know and what they don't know. So, it makes it hard too
go too in-depth into particular articles.
</p><p>
But, from my personal perspective, I see a lot of introduction articles,
like intro to Python, or intro to dbus, or intro to setting up your router,
or intro to KVM or intro to Git.
</p><p>
Sometimes these intro articles seem similar to those from previous years. Like the
Git article&mdash;I think there was an article in August 2011 that was similar to
an article in 2005.
</p><p>
I would like to see some more in-depth articles.
Here are some example topics.
</p><p>
Instead of an intro to KVM, what about some hints and tips for setting up
KVM with different network setups (NAS, private network), or setting up
removable devices (USB stick) or setting it up with multiple monitors?
All these things, for me, seem non-trivial.
</p><p>
Or, what about an entire issue on benchmarking? You could do one article on
comparing different distros via benchmarking. You could do another article
on comparing virtualization to physical. Or, you could do a
project where you show how readers could benchmark their boxes, and readers could
send in their results.
</p><p>
Finally, I know you just did an issue on the kernel, but there was no
article about where the kernel is going. What about an article on
possibilities for kernel development? Are there more and newer additions to
the kernel for virtualization? How will the kernel compete with Mountain
Lion and Windows 8? What new additions to the kernel will be added for
touchscreens?
</p><p>
Overall, I love your magazine. It's great, and I wouldn't be a subscriber
if it wasn't.
However, this is what I feel is missing.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Doug   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for your letter. It's only feedback like this that lets us know
the thoughts of our readers. We do try to cover both ends of the spectrum,
largely due to feedback like yours and feedback quite opposite: &ldquo;I want to
learn more about Linux, but your magazine seems to exclude all but the
seasoned veterans.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We will try to find the proper balance, and if the pendulum has gone the
other way a bit, hopefully, it will swing back toward the middle. Seriously
though, thank you for the feedback, it's critical!&mdash;Ed.

Games</h4><p>
I've read about all the games that are being brought to Linux now that Windows 8 is
out. I guess the developers hate how 8 is locked down.
How about some articles on the games? I love games.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Doug   <br><br>
</p><p>
Me too. &ldquo;Loving&rdquo; very rarely equates to &ldquo;is good
at&rdquo;, but I try not to let
that stop me. I have been keeping up on the Steam client for Linux, and once
that's released, perhaps it will spark a renewed interest in gaming. I
freely volunteer my services as resident game-tester!&mdash;Ed.

Ignorance in Windows Does Not Make You Knowledgeable in Linux</h4><p>
I have been a UNIX user for more than 30 years. I love UNIX because of the
philosophy on which UNIX was designed.
</p><p>
I have noticed that in the Linux community, many people try to show they are
knowledgeable by showing they are ignorant in Windows. An example of this is in The
Open-Source Classroom column in the November 2012 issue. The author stated that
&ldquo;after I learned to press Ctrl-Alt-Del to log in....&rdquo; One must
have lived on
Mars for decades not to know how to log in to Windows. It is theoretically
possible but practically very unlikely for someone working in the IT field
never to
have logged in to Windows.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
John Du  <br><br>
</p><p>
My apologies if my sarcasm was taken as a serious point of confusion. I was
trying to make a humorous observation that &ldquo;Ctrl-Alt-Del&rdquo; historically
has been how to reboot a computer, and it's ironically the way to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>begin</em></span>
computing in modern Windows.
</p><p>
If I'm being completely transparent, however, my new day job does
actually mark the first time I've ever had to press Ctrl-Alt-Del to log in.
I managed one Windows server in my last sysadmin position, but I used pGina
for authentication, so I never had to use the three-finger salute to get a
login prompt! (Your observation is correct though, I knew perfectly well
how to log in in my new Windows environment.)&mdash;Shawn.

A Better Shell Script Timeout Method</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's column in the November 2012
issue:
the following code handles multiple, even overlapping, shell script timeouts
reliably. It does not risk killing any unrelated process that just happens to
match <tt  >$myname</tt>. It sends
<tt  >SIGTERM</tt>, not <tt  >SIGALRM</tt>.
</p><p>
The following shell routines, taken from the script
<a href="http://pauljackson.us/watchdog_eg.sh" target="_self">pauljackson.us/watchdog_eg.sh</a>, provide a convenient and robust way for shell script authors to
handle multiple, even overlapping, timeouts in shell scripts:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# token = begin_watchdog(secs, func)
#
# Call function 'func' in 'secs' seconds unless
# end_watchdog() called first with 'token'

begin_watchdog()
{
        secs=$1
        func=$2
        dir=$(mktemp -d)
        (
                trap 'rmdir $dir' 1 2 3 15
                sleep $secs
                test -d $dir &amp;&amp; $func
        ) 1&gt;/dev/null &amp;

        # the returned token is just the temp directory path
        echo $dir
}

# end_watchdog(token)
#
# Call off the watchdog - rmdir the token directory

end_watchdog()
{
        dir=$1
        rmdir $dir
}

woof()
{
        echo Woof - Killing process group $$ 1&gt;&amp;2
        kill -TERM -$$ 1&gt;&amp;2
}

</pre>

November 2012 Issue</h4><p>
Thank you all for an excellent November issue. It just sparkled on my tablet,
especially all the Python stuff. Richard Delaney's article on how to use Python
inside Bash scripts was just what I was looking for.
I'd already used Bash inside Python, until discovering I simply was running
Bash in Python, so I dropped back to Bash itself. It simply never occurred to me
that the other way around was just as valuable.
</p><p>
As for Kyle Rankin's article on the N900 substitute: a very nice try, but
personally, I'm still clinging to my N900 until there's a real Linux solution or
until I can install a proper native Linux on my transformer&mdash;that is, one that doesn't
run on VNC.
</p><p>
Keep up the good work. I for one am very pleased with your digital format; it's
getting better and better, and it's a very convenient and cheap solution for us
subscribers abroad.

Thank you for the kind words. I just purchased a 10" tablet computer after
turning in my last one when changing jobs. I was surprised how much I
missed the tablet computer, largely due to the beautiful magazine
rendering. Much like the new digital billboards popping up all along the
highways, I find the digital magazine to grab my attention. I often worry
the former might cause car accidents, but I'm quite pleased with the
latter.
</p><p>
As to Kyle's N900, well, we've been teasing him ever since Maemo was
discontinued. He may have given up his N900, but it will take an army to
pry the IBM Model M keyboard from his fingers.&mdash;Ed.
