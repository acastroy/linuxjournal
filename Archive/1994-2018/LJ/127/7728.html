You are right, Fran&ccedil;ois, computers and operating systems have come a long
way. Not only do we have the good fortune to be running the operating
system of the future today, but we can take advantage of machines that
are faster
than ever before. I remember with some, well, I hesitate to call it
fondness, but I do remember my first x86-based PC. It was a turbo-charged
XT with a processor that ran at 10MHz. I also spent a small fortune
upgrading its RAM from 640K to 1,024K by plugging a couple of dozen
chips in to IC slots on the main board.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Of course not, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>,
although that stuff was fun at the time,
I would not give up the technology of today. That almost would be like
giving up Linux for another operating system. You know, Fran&ccedil;ois, it's
interesting to think about exactly how far
we have come&mdash;from megahertz to gigahertz processors in only a few short
years! Where will we end up in another ten years? I suppose
that faster than the speed of light may be possible, though I fear it
may take somewhat longer, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Still, you have given me an idea.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> Our guests are here already. To the wine
cellar, <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! Head to the north wing and check behind
that new shipment of Bordeaux wines Henri delivered yesterday. You'll
find a few cases of 2000 Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape. Forgive me,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Please sit and make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois
and I were discussing how far technology has come in the last
few years. My faithful waiter brought up the idea of faster-than-light
computing, certainly the ultimate in high-performance computing, this
issue's theme. Even if we could have computers delivering information at
beyond light speed, we still would need to absorb information at our own pace. One
thing is for sure, we wouldn't see the stars zipping by as we read the
latest on-line <i  >Linux Journal</i> column.
</p><p>
In terms of high performance, nothing beats the speed of light, at least
not without some strange matter or access to a matter/anti-matter
engine and some dilithium crystals. You can get that feeling by
firing up your screensaver and selecting rocks if you are using
xscreensaver or the OpenGL space in KDE's own list. How
objects look as you approach the speed of light is a popular mainstay of
science-fiction films, but generally speaking, we never get to see what
it actually might look like. That was the inspiration behind Daniel
Richard G.'s Light Speed!, a program designed to show precisely
what happens to our view of an object as it approaches the speed of
light. The program takes into consideration various relativistic
effects, such as Lorentz contraction, red/blue Doppler shift, headlight
effect and optical aberration. The About page on the Light Speed! Web
site describes all these effects (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes
amis</em></span>, you are sure to enjoy this wine&mdash;truly high-performance
strength, dark fruit flavors, a hint of coffee and mocha and a long
finish. Enjoy it while we crank up the speed a bit.
The build is very easy. You should be aware that you
need the OpenGL or Mesa development libraries loaded as well as the
gtkglarea libraries. From there, it's a simple extract and build
five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf lightspeed-1.2a.tar.gz
cd lightspeed-1.2a
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
Start the program by running <tt  >lightspeed</tt>. You
should see a window
appear with a three-dimensional lattice cube. In the upper right-hand
side,
an input box lets you enter a speed in meters per second. Start with
something fairly high; you also can use the up and down arrow keys to
increase or decrease speed with finer control. When you press Enter,
the object is accelerated to that speed with the resulting effects
shown in the graphical window.
</p><p>
A cube getting distorted as it approaches the speed of light is only so
interesting, although you can create a more complex lattice by clicking
File on the menu bar, selecting New Lattice and choosing the number
of points in three dimensions. The real question on my mind is what
happens to a spaceship as it approaches the speed of light? Luckily,
the Light Speed! Web site also has an objects download feature that you should
pick up too. It contains three additional objects, including a model of
the starship from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek Voyager</em></span> (Figure 1). To use a different
model, click File and select Load Object.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7728f1.large.jpg"><img src="7728f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. What really happens
to a starship as it approaches the speed of light?
</p></div></div><p>
One of the more interesting things you can do to extend this bit
of educational fun is to head over to the 3-D Cafe (see Resources),
where you will find a lot of three-dimensional models and meshes to try. Don't limit yourself
to spaceships, though; a race car approaching light speed also is fun
to use. Keep in mind that only models with a 3DS (3D Studio)
or LWO (LightWave 3D) extension work with this feature.
</p><p>
As much fun as it is to imagine what really happens under these conditions,
what we all really want to do is go flying through space at warp ten while
the stars zip by, arriving at some distant world before we can empty
another bottle of wine. For just such a trip, get your hands on Chris
Laurel's Celestia.
With Celestia, you can tour around our solar system, visit over 100,000
different stars, check out what's happening with various Earth-launched
spacecraft and much more. Source is available on the site, but there
are binaries for Mandrake and SuSE and others also are available. If you can't
find binaries for your distribution, never fear. Because this is an OpenGL
project, you need the 3-D libraries, but the build itself simply is
another extract and build five-step:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf celestia-1.3.1.tar.gz
cd celestia-1.3.1
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the program, call <tt  >celestia</tt> from the command
line or your command launcher. You need to know about a few keystrokes
right now, because they make the experience that much more fun. Pressing
the letter L accelerates time by a factor of ten. Doing so puts your
travel through space in motion relative to whatever object you have
chosen as your point of reference. Pressing K decelerates time, should you
start going a little too fast. Pressing Alt-C brings up the Celestia
browser from which you can select objects of many flavors. At the bottom
of the screen are four radio buttons. Click the With planets
button, and a list of stars with known planets appears. Want to visit
the planet orbiting 51 Pegasi? Right-click on the object's name, select
Goto and strap yourselves in for a faster-than-light trip to this alien
world. Once there, right-click on the star, 51 Pegasi, select Follow
and you can watch the planet's orbit as you remain focused on the star.
</p><p>
Keystrokes also let you specify the representation of stars, from tiny
pinpricks to fuzzy points to scaled discs. To find out what all the
keystrokes do, click Settings on the menu bar and select Configure
Shortcuts.
</p><p>
Celestia is a great program to sit back and explore and is well worth
the download. Aside from stars and planets, you can visit spacecraft
currently orbiting nearby worlds, such as the Mars Global Surveyor. Try
heading for the spacecraft, click on Mars and then select follow (Figure 2).
Now accelerate time. A number of major asteroids also are in the database
if you'd prefer a trip to Eros.

If zooming through space at or exceeding the speed of light is enough
to turn your stomach not to mention your face a few shades of green,
then perhaps a more down-to-earth space-based approach is in order. Why
not observe the stars and planets from the comfort of your non-moving
seat? The best way to do this is with a great program called KStars,
originally created by Jason Harris.
</p><p>
KStars is a desktop planetarium program that displays the locations of
stars and planets on your desktop. Because KStars is a part of the KDE
desktop environment&mdash;included in the kdeedu package&mdash;you don't have
to look far to get a copy. You can find
the latest on the package by visiting the Web site.
</p><p>
KStars is amazing fun but much more than a toy.
With a database of the
planets, 130,000 stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects, the planets and many
asteroids, KStars is an astronomical treasure. With it, you visually
can identify the position of stars, galaxies, nebulae and other glories of
the night sky. You can control what is displayed, zoom in on objects
and&mdash;I love this part&mdash;download images from on-line resources, such as
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hubble</em></span> and the Space Telescope Science
Institute. Simply right-click
on an object of interest, and the pop-up offers you additional
information and links to high-resolution images of those objects when
appropriate. Figure 3 shows my KStars session pulling
up information on the Trifid Nebula.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7728f3.large.jpg"><img src="7728f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. KStars can
import images from on-line databases such as <span  class="emphasis"><em>Hubble</em></span>'s.
</p></div></div><p>
When you start KStars, it assumes your location is Greenwich,
United Kingdom, which probably is not what you want.
Start by clicking Location on the menu bar
and selecting Geographic. A dialog box will appear with a world map.
Click an area on the map close to where you live. Doing so provides you
with a list of geographical points in a list to the right of the map.
Make your selection and click OK. Should you happen to know your latitude
and longitude, you can enter that at the bottom of the window instead.
</p><p>
KStars includes much more than what I can cover in this short visit. For
instance, KStars can control your telescope, locating and tracking
objects. Furthermore, if you are into astro-photography, KStars can
control CCDs, currently supporting Finger Lakes Instruments devices with
others in development.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> Although it may not have happened at hyper-light speeds,
it certainly has happened fast. Yes, I'm talking about the clock,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, which already is telling us it is closing time. With
talk of moving so quickly, it is at times like this that we can truly
appreciate sitting back under a starlit night, slowly sipping
a little more of this excellent Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape.
Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one another's health.
