This easy-to-deploy Web-based control system uses standard phone wiring and
can manage any device that supports an infrared
remote control.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b52500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article presents the design and development of a
control system for centralized operation of different
air-conditioning equipment in a building by using Linux and the
real-time Linux application interface (RTAI).
Each air conditioner, distributed throughout the building,
has it own infrared (IR) remote controller. The goal is to
replace them with a centralized computer-based control system
to operate the air conditioners, including turning them on
or off and setting the desired temperature and fan speed.
</p><p>
The idea for this project came from the need of a local university
to have a centralized and flexible way to operate its air conditioners
at a cost within its budget. Commercial software and
hardware exists for the same purpose, but normally they are too expensive and
manufacturer-dependent.
</p><p>
This project's hardware solution consists of a central control computer,
running Linux, connected to an RS-485 microcontroller network. The
microcontrollers have the capability to send commands to the related
air conditioner using infrared signals
to operate the nearby equipment.
</p><p>
The software design of the system includes two real-time tasks&mdash;a main
control task and the RS-485 network control task&mdash;as
well as two non-real-time tasks&mdash;a Web server and a database.
The Web server is in charge of the user interface, making
it available from any browser in the university's computer
network. The PostgreSQL database is used as the main data
repository.
</p><p>
The implementation is a low-cost solution with the flexibility
to extend it as necessary. Moreover, it is not manufacturer-dependent, and
it works with any air conditioner that supports an
IR remote controller. Each air conditioner works independently
using its own temperature control system. To supervise the
operation of this equipment, each microcontroller in the
network is equipped with a temperature sensor to monitor the
actual classroom temperature and report it to the central
computer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b52768"></a>
User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The entire user interface is based on Web pages. The first page displays
a summary of the actual state of each air conditioner. This information
includes an identification string, the room in the building where it is
located, the actual room temperature
and whether the equipment has a preprogrammed operation sequence according
to which it actually is operating.
For each air conditioner,
this page has a link to the operation
interface for the specific piece of equipment. Before going to this page, the
system asks for a user name and password. At this level,
it is possible to interact with the system directly controlling the
air conditioner or to create or change the actual program for automatic
operation (Figure 1).

Figure 1. From the operation interface, an authorized user
can turn the air conditioner on, set a new temperature or
turn it off.
</p></div></div><p>
The most interesting part of the system is the programmed
operation. For example, every day the system can
turn on the air conditioners automatically, with a predefined temperature
setting for each room, before classes begin. Then, the
system can turn off the air conditioners at a time in the
evening when the activities in the building or in a specific
classroom end.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b52a80"></a>
Hardware Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The hardware architecture is composed of a central control computer and
microcontrollers commanding the air-conditioning equipment. All the
microcontrollers are connected to an RS-485 two-wire network.
The microcontroller used in this application is the AT89C2051, an
Intel 8051 derivative from ATMEL. It is encapsulated in a 20-pin
DIP package and is equipped with 128 bytes of data RAM, 2KB of ROM for
code, one asynchronous serial port and 14 independent digital
I/O ports. Figure 2 shows the microcontroller board and its parts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7258f2.large.jpg"><img src="7258f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The microcontroller board with the microcontroller removed.
</p></div></div><p>
The software in the microcontroller generates the IR signal using one
digital output port. The serial port connects the microcontroller
to the RS-485 network. Each microcontroller board is equipped with a
temperature sensor, the DS1620 from Dallas Semiconductor. The
microcontroller communicates with the temperature sensor using a digital
three-wire synchronous serial interface. The microcontroller has no hardware
support for synchronous serial ports; therefore, it is implemented in
software using normal I/O ports.
</p><p>
The RS-485 network is used in this application because it is easy to
deploy, cheap to implement and easily can connect a useful number of
nodes. Only one pair of Category 3 telephony grade cable connects
the nodes. Due to the hardware driver limitation, the maximum number
of allowed nodes is 32, but this number easily can be extended using network
repeaters. The maximum cable length between the control computer and
the first repeater or between repeaters is 1,200 meters.
</p><p>
A master-slave protocol controls access to the physical cable. The
computer running Linux is the master, which polls each node with a predefined
rate. On every polling the master can send commands to the node; the
polled node answers by sending data to the master or by sending an empty
packet to say that the node is active. A drawback of using this
access-control protocol occurs if the master goes down&mdash;the entire
network goes down too.
</p><p>
Considering the limited resources of the microcontrollers, the 9th-bit
protocol is used to determine whether the packet sent through the network is
for this controller. Each byte transmitted through the network
has an additional bit. The packet destination address is the only one
transmitted with this additional bit set to high. The microcontroller's
UART (universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter) is programmed by
default to generate an interrupt only if the 9th bit of the received
byte is high. The interrupt service routine then compares the received byte
with the node address. If there is a match, the routine programs the UART
to receive all the bytes regardless of the 9th-bit state, until the
end of the packet. If the destination address does not match this node
address, the interrupt service routine returns.
</p><p>
The central control computer UART, which is PC hardware, does
not directly support the 9th-bit protocol. To overcome this
limitation, the driver simulates it by using the parity bit. Before
transmitting a byte, the driver configures the parity to generate
a one in the 9th bit of the address byte and a zero in the
9th bit of the other bytes.
</p><p>
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the tasks in the system and the communication
links between them.

Real-Time Tasks</h2></div></div><p>
The main control task, the network access-control task and the software
driver for the physical layer of the RS-485 network are the tasks that
run in the real-time executive.
An RS-485 driver was developed for RTAI. This driver is similar to
any other serial driver, except for the 9th-bit protocol used in
this application, as described above.
</p><p>
The other real-time task is the network access-control task, which is
in charge of periodically sending packets to each network node. This
packet can be a command to generate an IR signal, a poll to see if the
node is active or a command to the microcontroller to transmit the actual
room temperature. The node answers with an acknowledgement to the first
two types of packets and with the actual room temperature to the last
one. The information about the actual state of every node is available
to the main control task, which in turn informs the user interface if
a node fails.
</p><p>
The main control task, using information retrieved from
the database, operates the air-conditioning equipment in
the building, as programmed. This task also can receive
instructions from the user interface that overrides the
programmed configuration, using two RT-FIFOs. RT-FIFOs are an
interprocess communication routine for communication between
real-time tasks and normal Linux tasks. To communicate with the
PostgreSQL database, a Linux d&aelig;mon was developed.
This d&aelig;mon communicates with
the main control task using two more RT-FIFOs. An additional
important function of this d&aelig;mon is to send to the main control
task the system date and time; no support for
reading it exists in RTAI.
</p><p>
The developed system sends commands to the air conditioners,
eliminating the need for local remote controllers. We do not interfere with
the air-conditioner temperature control system, nor do we touch any
internal circuitry. Each air
conditioner has its own temperature control system built-in,
and the temperature sensor in each microcontroller supervises that the
equipment is working fine. Figure 4 shows the microcontroller board installed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7258f4.large.jpg"><img src="7258f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b534d0"></a>
Linux Tasks</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux tasks are in charge of presenting the user interface through
a Web server and running the PostgreSQL database engine, which is the
main data repository. As described above, another Linux side task is a
d&aelig;mon used for the RTAI main control task to access the system date/time
and the database.
</p><p>
The user interface is simple. The first page presents information
about the actual state of each air conditioner. Every type of user
can access this page. In order to change the program or send commands
to a particular air conditioner, the system asks for a user name and
password. PHP is used to generate the Web pages dynamically to present
the information retrieved from the database.
</p><p>
In the PostgreSQL database, the system stores general information about the air
conditioners, such as BTU, location, brand and microcontroller network node
address; the programmed operations; and the IR commands
needed to operate each air conditioner.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b53688"></a>
IRC Command Interface</h2></div></div><p>
An important part of the system is the module that reads the air-conditioner remote controller signals and stores the information,
associated with the corresponding equipment, in the database to
reproduce it using the networked microcontrollers. This module is
used
only when adding a type of air conditioner
that has a different brand and/or different remote controller commands.
</p><p>
Two tasks are part of this module: the first is a real-time
task that reads the IR signal. The LIRC Project as well as
the Ripoll and Acosta paper in the on-line Resources, present detailed
information about IR remote controllers and sample
implementations using normal Linux and RTLinux, another
real-time executive for Linux. The other task for this
module is the user interface that runs on Linux. The two
tasks communicate using an RT-FIFO.
</p><p>
Due to the small amount of RAM available in the microcontroller and
the long IR signal duration, an important function of this software is
to help the user obtain repetitive patterns within the different
IR remote controller signals associated with each button or combination of
buttons. These patterns are coded in the firmware of the microcontroller and
are used to reconstruct the command to control the equipment. For example, if
there are ten different patterns, the information sent to the appropriate
microcontroller in the network is something like: repeat pattern one ten
times, then pattern two three times and so on, until the complete command
is reconstructed.
This technique has the advantage of using fewer resources for signal
reconstruction. The disadvantage is
the software of the microcontroller needs to be changed to
introduce the patterns of the newly added equipment whenever a new air
conditioner is introduced.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b53840"></a>
Costs</h2></div></div><p>
Currently, nine air conditioners are controlled using the system described
here; all of them are located in the same building. Another 15
will be added soon.
The hardware cost of each microcontroller node is $60 US, and the central
control computer costs about $500 US. The other costs are the deployment
of the RS-485 network and, of course, the development and implementation
of the system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a5a580.0x1b53948"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The implemented system fulfills the specifications of the actual
user. Because of this project's success, every new air conditioner
acquired by the university must be compatible with the system. The only
condition that must be met to comply with the system is every new air conditioner must have an
IR remote controller.
</p><p>
Thanks to RTAI, the system main control task is independent of the user
interface tasks running in Linux. Even in the improbable situation that
Linux goes down, the system would continue on with the programmed operations.
</p><p>
In the future, the system may be extended easily to control, for example,
the building lights, alarms, access control to restricted areas and
other systems.
