GumStix, founded in 2004, focuses on single-board computers (SBCs)
built around the Intel XScale PXA255 chip
with Linux onboard.
This review covers two GumStix products in the WaySmall line, the WS200 and WS200-bt,
one with and one without an Infineon ROK104001
Bluetooth module. The case is basic and small
(1.5" &times; .25" &times; .5") with two mini-DIN8 serial connects
and a USB mini-B port connector, a port for an MMC
Flash memory module and a 0.65 mm 4.5V power connector.
The version equipped with Bluetooth has an
antenna connector as well.
</p><p>
It is clear that the GumStix product line is evolving and
expanding rapidly. Since this review began, GumStix has added Bluetooth
as an option, and the company provided the second evaluation unit well into the
review process. In addition to Bluetooth, the newer version of the
WS200 has a 60-pin Hirose daughterboard connector rather than the 24-pin
MOLEX connector on the original evaluation model.
I found GumStix to be responsive to my concerns, and the company has
shown itself to be responsive to their users and open to challenges in
developing novel products. Hopefully, that attitude will not change.
</p><p>
The GumStix has the potential to be a truly breakaway
product. Several other
SBCs are available, but
none offers the combination of price, functionality, size
and low power consumption that GumStix offers. If you're an embedded
developer, the speed will make you happy, and the
ease of use will make you smile for days. I had
the WaySmall running, connected to my Fedora Core 2
notebook, in less than 15 minutes. The WaySmall
devices are an excellent place to start learning
embedded Linux.
</p><p>
Now, a little bad news: the
documentation is a work in progress; however, the company
indicates that it understands the documentation
has issues and is working hard to improve it. GumStix
recently added a Wiki with up-to-date information and is
rewriting the user manuals.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd0b0"></a>
Toolchains</h2></div></div><p>
The Intel XScale
PXA255 CPU with its ARM core has several toolchains available, and
the manufacturer recommends both the gcc-3.3.2 and gcc-3.4.0 compilers.
By publication time, additional sets of tools will be added to the ones
listed here.
The variety of tools is a useful aspect of the GumStix,
because not all tools provide the same options and utilities. Further,
because most companies have preferred toolchains, and many of us have
our own preferences, not being tied to a particular toolchain is an
excellent feature.
</p><p>
Don't believe the GumStix manual
when it states that it takes 30 minutes to download and install the toolchain and to create, install and run the ubiquitous HelloWorld.c. The time
it takes to do so depends on many variables, such as, which toolchain you select
and how much horsepower the host has. Finally, an MMC adapter on the host
is recommended by GumStix, but I found it to be absolutely essential.
</p><p>
The uClibc toolchain already was installed on my machine, so it was not
necessary to reinstall it, but I tried to make sure it worked.
I was not surprised to find it did not, as it was unable to resolve a server
for one of the components. I brought this point up with GumStix in a
conversation, and the rep said the company was
preparing a new set of tools to resolve this and some other
issues. At that point, however, the new tools were not ready for review,
which was
a relief because I found uClibc temperamental to configure and install.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd268"></a>
Embedded</h2></div></div><p>
One nice feature of the GumStix is the option not to have the
Bluetooth capability. That might sound strange to those of you new to embedded
applications, but there are many reasons not to want this feature. First, don't pay for
something you don't use. Second, the absence of Bluetooth allows one to reduce the overall
complexity of the devices, making them more reliable. Third, the
Bluetooth module consumes power and processor time. With
Bluetooth being optional, you can develop your application and then
drop Bluetooth and use a simpler replacement, without having to
worry about compatibility.
</p><p>
One point on the GumStix design: as mentioned earlier, the Molex connector
was replaced by the Hirose connector. This is a real improvement, as
the Hirose is more solid than the Molex and makes the GumStix-daughterboard connection much more stable. Mechanical stability definitely
is an issue with the GumStix. At present, the connector is the only means
of physical stability between the GumStix board and any daughterboard.
This definitely is not an optimal arrangement. Hopefully, GumStix will
add a drill hole or at least call out some locations on the silk screen
where holes could be added or glue points might be placed. Mounting the
GumStix in high-vibration or impact applications will make this a must.
I found that even fairly mild handling could dislodge the daughterboard
enough to make the connection fail, unless the case was securely attached.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd3c8"></a>
Web</h2></div></div><p>
GumStix comes with BusyBox preloaded. BusyBox
is an embedded application package with a large number of tools, one of
which is a Web server. To use it, install your site at /var/www/html,
reboot the WaySmall and off you go. One immediate application
is to add a Web interface to your embedded application. Additionally,
one could build a dedicated Web application for a WaySmall and
essentially have an application in a box. Keep in mind that the Intel PXA255 has
no floating-point unit, so number crunching is a stretch. However,
several popular lightweight Web applications could run
easily on a dedicated WaySmall.
</p><p>
Simple text-based HTML created with a minimal amount of graphics and no
scripting was easy to accomplish. If you have an application that would not
stress the server, you will be in good shape. The processor speed was more
than adequate, but the RAM, storage and bandwidth were limitations on
the evaluation unit. The 32MB of RAM is too little storage space for anything
significant. The RAM is fixed, too, so you have to work around it.
Storage is more flexible, however, with up to
512MB available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd528"></a>
Remarks</h2></div></div><p>
I suggest checking your intended host computer to see if it
has a serial port, because a lot of newer machines delete them in favor
of USB.
I also suggest that you purchase
the power supply, the 128MB MMC module and an MMC adapter for
your host machine. Third, as indicated earlier, mechanical stability is a
real issue with the GumStix. During the evaluation process, the antenna
of the WS200f-bt became damaged and the Bluetooth failed.
This occurred because the serial cable became tangled with the antenna.
Additionally,
when the host machine was moved, a load was placed on the PCB connector
and a solder failed. Thus, the Bluetooth-equipped WaySmall may be too
fragile for practical applications. This is a known problem, however, and
will be resolved when the integrated antenna is added.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd630"></a>
Bluetooth</h2></div></div><p>
Bluetooth is an excellent addition. The bandwidth of Bluetooth is
substantially better than the serial connection and should be better
than the USB 1.1 option. The Bluetooth-enabled models allow you to go
wireless. They automatically boot to a configuration with rfcomm,
generating a Bluetooth serial port called /dev/rfcomm0, and the startup script
starts a getty over it.
I was able to establish a serial connection over the Bluetooth, and it
was faster than the USB 1.1 connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd738"></a>
What Next?</h2></div></div><p>
GumStix is refining its products rapidly, but I am going to make some
predictions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
First, look for an integrated antenna. As a part of this change, I
expect to see the serial ports dropped in favor of serial-over-Bluetooth.
</p></li><li><p>
Second, expect to see Ethernet added to the GumStix, certainly an
Ethernet-enabled device with a connector off one end. I would prefer
to see wireless Ethernet in lieu of Bluetooth, but that is my preference.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e4580.0x18dd9f8"></a>
Wrap-Up</h2></div></div><p>
The bottom line is the GumStix SBCs are cool. Their ease of use, small
sizes,
low power consumption and flexibility make them excellent choices for
a wide range of applications. GumStix are good alternatives to most
of the other SBC form factors presently available and should be given
serious consideration for any new embedded development efforts.
