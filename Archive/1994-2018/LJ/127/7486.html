With a little work, the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) can be
adapted to create stunning three-dimensional imagery from floating-point
scientific data files.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0a298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I am a meteorologist at Central Michigan University doing research with
collaborators at the University of Illinois on the behavior of supercell
thunderstorms, the long-lived rotating monsters that
wreak havoc across the Great Plains of the United States every spring. My primary
tool for studying the behavior of these fearsome storms is a numerical
model called NCOMMAS, a computer application written in FORTRAN 90 that
uses the equations of physics to emulate the three-dimensional state of
the atmosphere over time. This model produces an immense amount of data
over the course of a four-hour thunderstorm simulation, on the order of
200GB, even when using a lossy compressed history file format. One of
the great challenges I face in my research is finding ways to visualize
this data in a way that provides scientific insight into the physical
nature of the simulated storm.
</p><p>
One way to visualize 3-D data is to use a raytracer, a computer
application that simulates the behavior of light interacting with
virtual objects in three dimensions to create a bitmapped image (Figure
1). This
bitmapped image can be displayed on a computer screen and/or saved to
disk in an image format such as PPM or TIFF. The Persistence of Vision
Raytracer, POV-Ray for short, is a popular open-source raytracer that
caught my attention while I was working on my doctoral thesis at the
University of Wisconsin in the mid-1990s. At the time, I was looking
for software to visualize my 3-D model data
of microbursts, severe downdrafts that sometimes descend from
thunderstorm clouds. Being accustomed to the shared-source nature of
the academic world and being a poor grad student, I was looking for
free software distributed in source code form that I could download
and modify to fit my own specific needs. POV-Ray was the logical choice
for me then, and it continues to suit my needs today in creating raytraced
representations of my research data.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7486f1.large.jpg"><img src="7486f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An aerial view of the whole supercell thunderstorm cloud from
a distance of about 30 kilometers, rendered with POV-Ray.
</p></div></div><p>
Rendering scientific data isn't the task for which POV-Ray
was designed, however, and few researchers are using
POV-Ray for rendering scientific data. Other raytracing packages geared
toward the researcher doing work with numerical models exist, but they are
proprietary and expensive. In this article, I outline the process of
modifying POV-Ray so that isosurfaces of 3-D scientific
data can be rendered natively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0a608"></a>
Getting the Source</h2></div></div><p>
Although POV-Ray is distributed in binary form for Linux, Mac OS and
Microsoft Windows, you need to obtain the source code in order to apply
patches and make further customizations. I am using the latest version
of POV-Ray available as of this writing, version 3.5. You need to select the
Unix/Linux/Generic Source Code option from the POV-Ray download
page. In addition, you need to obtain Ryouichi Suzuki's Density
File extension patch (see the on-line Resources), which actually is a Zip file
containing replacement source code for a handful of the POV-Ray files.
The file pov35dfjs.zip should be unpacked in the povray-3.50c/src
directory, where 13 files will be overwritten.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0a710"></a>
Scenes and Isosurfaces</h2></div></div><p>
POV-Ray works by reading a scene description file that contains all
of the information necessary to create a bitmapped image. POV-Ray
has its own scene description language, which is well documented on
the POV-Ray Web site. If you never have used a raytracer before, I
recommend familiarizing yourself with raytracer basics and POV-Ray's
scene description file before making modifications to the source.
</p><p>
Items rendered in POV-Ray are called objects. Examples of objects
include Box, Sphere, Torus and Plane. The user specifies where objects
exist in the scene, what parameters to use in creating the objects, what
color to make the objects, lighting parameters and so forth. These
specifications are made in a scene description file, sometimes called a
pov file because of the .pov suffix, which is a plain-text file parsed by
POV-Ray at runtime.
</p><p>
One versatile object is the isosurface, a
3-D shape whose surface represents points where a function's
value is constant. The constant value of the function is chosen by the
user. POV-Ray contains many predefined objects that actually could be
represented as isosurfaces. For instance, the following section from a
scene description file would render a gray sphere with a radius of 0.7
units, centered at the origin, which is Cartesian gridpoint (0,0,0):

<pre     class="programlisting">

sphere
{
    &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 0.7
    pigment {rgb .5}
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The same object could be rendered as an isosurface object in the
following way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#declare R = 0.7
isosurface
{
    function {x*x + y*y + z*z - R*R}
    pigment {rgb .5}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This works because the mathematical formula describing a sphere
of radius R is:
</p><p>
x<sup  >2</sup> + y<sup  >2</sup> + z<sup  >2</sup> - R<sup  >2</sup> = 0
</p><p>
This versatility of the isosurface object
makes it the object of choice for my thunderstorm images.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0ac38"></a>
Density Files</h2></div></div><p>
In the sphere example, a mathematical function was used to calculate
the isosurface value. My thunderstorm numerical model data cannot be
represented as a mathematical function; instead, it is represented as
three-dimensional floating-point arrays containing model variables such
as temperature, wind speed and cloud concentration at each grid
location (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7486f2.large.jpg"><img src="7486f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. An example of multiple isosurfaces, focusing on a region of
the supercell called the wall cloud. The yellow isosurfaces in the
foreground, which are located below the wall cloud, represent where
tornado-like swirling motion is occurring.
</p></div></div><p>
POV-Ray 3.5 has a feature called a density file that allows for the
mapping of functions represented as gridpoint values. The
POV-Ray documentation describes a density file as follows:
&ldquo;The density_file pattern is a 3-D bitmap pattern that occupies a
unit cube from location &lt;0,0,0&gt; to &lt;1,1,1&gt;. The data file is a
raw binary file format created for POV-Ray called df3 format.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Density files can be used as functions passed as an argument to the
isosurface object. Here is an example of a density file being used for
isosurface rendering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#declare DENSFUNC=function
{
    pattern
    {
        density_file df3 "cloud.df3"
        interpolate 1
    }
}
isosurface {function { 0.1 - DENSFUNC(x,y,z) }
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, an isosurface with value 0.1 would be created from
the cloud.df3 file using a trilinear interpolation scheme (more on
interpolation below).
</p><p>
The density file format is strict, and the data values are represented
as 8-bit data (unsigned short integers ranging from 0 to 255) scaled
internally to range from 0.0 to 1.0. Because my thunderstorm data is
32-bit floating-point data, it is not feasible to use the density file
format with the stock POV-Ray 3.5.
</p><p>
Enter Ryouichi Suzuki, who has been providing POV-Ray with unofficial
add-on code since 1996. He provided the first patches to POV-Ray 3.0,
which introduced the isosurface object, now a standard object in version
3.5. Suzuki's code, contained in the Zip file referenced above, contains
routines that expand the functionality of POV-Ray density files,
including the option of rendering floating-point density file data.
</p><p>
When using density files as functions one must consider
that although a mathematical function is a continuous expression&mdash;it
is defined for any floating-point value of x, y and z spatial
coordinates&mdash;a density file is a discrete set of data referenced by
integer array indices. Interpolation must be done for referencing
space in between gridpoints when rendering a scene. The two
interpolation methods available are trilinear and tricubic spline.
Trilinear interpolation is fast but usually does not produce as smooth
an interpolation as does tricubic spline interpolation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0b1b8"></a>
Getting Model Data into POV-Ray</h2></div></div><p>
After patching the POV-Ray 3.5 code with Suzuki's density file code, you
can render floating-point isosurfaces if you adhere to the df3 format
or Suzuki's extended format. In my case, I had hundreds of gigabytes of
HDF (hierarchical data format) model data, which is designed specifically
for numerical models. Because I am interested in not only producing a
few isosurface images but making animations from hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of these images, writing an HDF to df3 converter for each of
these files was not a viable option. Hence, I started looking closely at
the POV-Ray routines that handle density file data with the hope that I
could modify the code to read HDF data.
</p><p>
It was important to me that the modifications I made to POV-Ray would
not cause a loss of functionality or break compatibility with the
unpatched version. I achieved this goal by adding some new objects,
referenced in the scene description file, that could be parsed and
rendered by my patched version, while leaving all other objects alone.
</p><p>
The main piece of code I modified is found in pattern.cpp, which
contains the Read_Density_File routine. This routine, as you might have
guessed, reads density file data into a three-dimensional array. Using
this routine as a template, I created a new routine, Read_Hdf_File,
to read my history file data into POV-Ray. This is where most of the
modification of the POV-Ray code needs to be made to adhere to your own
data format. An abbreviated version of Read_Hdf_file is shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0b370"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Abbreviated Read_Hdf_File Listing from pattern.cpp
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
void Read_Hdf_File (DENSITY_FILE * df)
{
    Locate_Density_File(df-&gt;Data-&gt;Name);
    df-&gt;Data-&gt;Type = 1; //floating point data
    Open_HDF_File(df-&gt;Data-&gt;Name);
    //povray needs array dimensions
    Read_HDF_File_Geometry(nx,ny,nz);
    df-&gt;Data-&gt;Sx = nx;
    df-&gt;Data-&gt;Sy = ny;
    df-&gt;Data-&gt;Sz = nz;
    //this array will contain density file data
    Allocate_Memory(mapF,nx,ny,nz);
    //read variable into mapF array
    Get_HDF_File_Data(Var,mapF,nx,ny,nz);
    //density file pointer now points to model data
    df-&gt;Data-&gt;DensityF = mapF;
}
</pre></div><p>
The function of Read_Hdf_file is to read HDF floating-point data into
mapF, a 3-D array of floats, where it now is ready to be manipulated as
a density file. I wrote a separate piece of code called history.c, which
contains all of the HDF I/O routines referenced in pattern.cpp. Your
data file format will require its own format-specific code to read
your 3-D data into POV-Ray.
</p><p>
A few more files were modified in order for
POV-Ray to recognize the new HDF file format natively and to allow
for the rendering of more than one model variable per scene. Table 1
contains a list of the files modified and a brief description of what
was done to each file.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c12580.0x1d0b5d8"></a><p class="title"><b>

accommodate model data into POV-Ray and a brief description of what was

The HDF file format allows for more than one variable to be stored in
each file, unlike the density_file format. In my case, each HDF file is
a snapshot of the model state at a given time and contains 12 3-D
variables per file. It often is illustrative to look at multiple variables,
such as cloud, rain, hail and snow, together in one scene. I achieved
this by creating a new token representing the HDF file format, called HDF_TOKEN (distinct from DF3_TOKEN representing
the original df3 format), and added a new character array called Var to
the structure Density_file_Data_Struct. Var is assigned in the scene
description file and is passed as an argument to the HDF routines to
specify what model variable to select. In order to parse the
variable name (represented as a character string), I added an additional
case statement to the Parse_PatternFunction routine in parstxtr.cpp
(Listing 2). Notice the addition of Parse_Comma and Parse_C_String, which
grab the variable to be read.

The Scene Description File</h2></div></div><p>
All of the pieces are now in place to construct a scene description
file to be interpreted by POV-Ray. I used the example found on Suzuki's
density file extension Web page as a template and modified it to fit
my needs. Listing 3 contains the full scene description file used to
render an isosurface of cloud concentration with a sky-blue background
and a tiled surface, shown in Figure 1. Starting at the top, the #version
statement is required in order for this unofficial version of POV-Ray to
function. The following nine #declare statements specify the Cartesian
coordinates that bound the box containing the isosurface, as well as
scaling factors.

</pre></div><p>
Continuing through the scene description file, the color and finish
parameters are declared, and the camera and lighting parameters are
set. The lines that follow contain the important bits for creating the
isosurface. QCFUNC is declared as a function that uses the HDF file
supercell.ck10990.hdf as a source of data; it chooses the variable QC
(representing cloud concentration) within the file to render. Tricubic
spline interpolation is chosen, and the entire domain is scaled so that
all spatial indices, such as camera location and light location,
coincide with array index values of the data. By default, POV-Ray's
domain ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in all three directions.
</p><p>
I created a macro called QCISOSFC, which takes as arguments the value
of the isosurface I wanted to render and the level of transparency
of the isosurface. Transparency is a useful isosurface property
when rendering two isosurfaces where one exists inside another. For
example, it is useful to render a transparent cloud that contains an
isosurface of hail concentration, because hail often is contained within a
thunderstorm cloud. QCFUNC, defined above, is selected as the isosurface
function to render. The chosen isosurface binds a volume of cloud
concentration greater than the chosen isosurface value of 0.0002.
</p><p>
The max_gradient parameter basically tells POV-Ray how much work it
needs to do to find the isosurface. Technically, it tells POV-Ray
what maximum gradient (largest change over distance) the function
representing the isosurface data contains in the vicinity of the chosen
isosurface. It is a number that must be chosen carefully. Too low a
value produces an isosurface with holes or one that does not render at
all; too large a value causes POV-Ray to run for a much longer
time than is necessary. Some experimentation is required to find
an appropriate value for max_gradient. I chose a value of 0.0002, which
may seem small; however, cloud concentration ranges from 0.0 to about
0.01. POV-Ray warns you after rendering an isosurface with too large
or small a value of max_gradient and suggests a value it deems
appropriate after rendering.

Making Pictures and More</h2></div></div><p>
In order to compile with your changes, you may need to make some minor
modifications to src/Makefile, which is generated once you run
<tt  >configure</tt> from the top-level POV-Ray directory.
This is the case if you are
using external libraries for your history file reading routines or if
you've written a separate piece of code to handle file I/O.
</p><p>
Once compiled, you can invoke POV-Ray from the command line. The
following command would read from cloud.pov and create a 600&times;400
anti-aliased PPM file, displaying to the screen as it rendered:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/orf/povray-3.50c-orf/src/povray +D \
Input_File_Name=cloud Width=600 Height=400 \
Antialias=on Output_File_Type=P
</pre>
</p><p>
Once your data has rendered successfully with POV-Ray, you
have POV-Ray's extensive set of configurable options to
choose from to render your scene exactly the way you want. If you have
data that changes over time, making animations is straightforward and
rewarding. I have written Python scripts to invoke an instance
of POV-Ray on each of the processors on my small renderfarm,
where each processor works concurrently on a
different model time. The resulting PPM files then are joined together
to make animations, using mjpegtools. See my research page for some
animations. I also have created stereo images and animations for
display on our department's GeoWall system. Stereo pair generation is
trivial with POV-Ray and truly can give you a whole new perspective on
your data. Getting POV-Ray to work with my model data has opened the
door to many exciting possibilities for me, and I hope that it will for
you, too.
