Hardware design finally enters the 21st century.
This new tool brings the readable code of Python
and the test discipline of extreme programming to
hardware projects.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Digital hardware design typically is done using a specialized
language, called a hardware description language (HDL). This approach
is based on the idea that hardware design has unique requirements. The
mainstream HDLs are Verilog and VHDL.
</p><p>
The MyHDL Project challenges conventional wisdom by making it possible
to use Python, a high-level, general-purpose language, for
hardware design. This approach lets hardware designers benefit from
a well-designed, widely used language and the
open-source model behind it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd03f8"></a>
Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
An HDL contains certain concepts that reflect the nature of
hardware. The most characteristic concept is a model for massive
concurrency. An HDL description consists of a large amount of tiny
threads that communicate closely with one another. This design calls for an
approach to threading that is as lightweight as possible.
HDL descriptions are executed on a dedicated runtime
environment called a simulator.
</p><p>
When designing MyHDL, I took a minimalistic approach, which is in line
with the Python spirit and a good idea in general. Therefore, an
important part of MyHDL is a usage model for
Python. The other part consists of a Python package, called myhdl,
that contains objects that implement HDL concepts. The following
Python code imports some MyHDL objects that we are going to use shortly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from myhdl import Signal, Simulation, delay, now
</pre>
</p><p>
MyHDL models concurrency with generator functions, recently
introduced in Python (see the on-line Resources). They are similar to classic functions,
except they have a nonfatal return capability. When a generator
function is called, it returns a generator, which is the object of
interest. Generators are resumable and keep state between
invocations, making them usable as ultra-lightweight threads.
</p><p>
The following example is a generator function that models
a clock generator:

<pre     class="programlisting">
    def clkgen(clk):
        """ Clock generator.
        clk -- clock signal
        """
        while 1:
            yield delay(10)
            clk.next = not clk
</pre>
</p><p>
This function looks similar to a classic function in Python. Notice that the
functional code starts with a while 1 loop; this is the idiomatic way
to keep a generator alive forever. The essential difference between
a classic and a generator function is the yield statement. It
behaves similarly to a return statement, except the generator
remains alive after yielding and can be resumed from that
point. Moreover, the yield statement returns a delay
object. In MyHDL, this mechanism is used to pass control information
to the simulator. In this case, the simulator is informed that it
should resume the generator after a delay of ten time units.
</p><p>
The parameter clk represents a clock signal. In MyHDL, signals are
used for communication among generators. The concept of a signal is
inherited from VHDL. A signal is an object with two values: a
read-only current value and a next value that can be modified by assigning
it to the .next attribute. In the example, the clock signal is
toggled by setting its next value to the inverse of its current value.
</p><p>
To simulate the clock generator, we first create a clock signal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
clk = Signal(bool(0))
</pre>
</p><p>
The signal clk has a Boolean zero as its initial value. Now, we
can create a clock generator by calling the generator function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
clkgen_inst = clkgen(clk)
</pre>
</p><p>
To have a minimally useful simulation, let's create another generator
that monitors and prints the changes of the clock signal over time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def monitor():
    print "time: clk"
    while 1:
        print "%4d: %s" % (now(), int(clk))
        yield clk
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The yield clk statement shows how a generator can wait on a
change of the signal value.
</p><p>
In MyHDL, a simulator is created with the Simulation object
constructor, which takes an arbitrary number of generators as
parameters:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sim = Simulation(clkGen_inst, monitor())
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the simulator, we call its run method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sim.run(50)
</pre>
</p><p>
This runs the simulation for 50 time units. The output is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python clkgen.py
time: clk
   0: 0
  10: 1
  20: 0
  30: 1
  40: 0
  50: 1
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, we can describe how the simulator works. The simulation
algorithm is inspired by VHDL, an HDL slightly less popular
than Verilog but a better example to follow. The simulator
coordinates the parallel execution of all generators using an
event-driven algorithm. The object that a generator yields specifies
the event for which it wants to wait before its next invocation.
</p><p>
Suppose that at a given simulation step, some generators become active
because the event they were waiting on has occurred. In a first
simulation phase, all active generators are run, using current signal
values and assigning to next values. In a second phase, the current
signal values are updated with the next values. As a result of signal
value changes, some generators become active again, and the simulation
cycle repeats. This mechanism guarantees determinism, because the
order in which the active generators are run is irrelevant for the
behavior of the model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad8580.0xbd0d40"></a>
A Real Design Example</h2></div></div><p>
Having introduced the concepts, we now are ready to tackle a real design
example with MyHDL. I have chosen a serial peripheral interface (SPI)
slave hardware module. SPI is a popular synchronous serial control
interface originally designed by Motorola.
</p><p>
A single SPI master can control multiple slaves. There are three common
I/O
ports: mosi, the master-out, slave-in serial line; miso, the
master-in, slave-out serial line; and sclk, the serial clock driven
by the master. In addition, a slave select line, ss_n,
exists for each slave. SPI communication always occurs in the two directions
simultaneously. In general, the active clock edge that triggers data
changes is configurable. In this example, we use the rising edge.
</p><p>
The MyHDL code of the SPI slave is shown in Listing 1. A classic
Python function called SPISlave is used to model a hardware
module. The function has all interface signals as its parameters, and
it returns two generators. This code illustrates how hierarchy is modeled
in MyHDL: a higher-level function calls lower-level functions and
includes the returned generators in its own return value.

                sreg[0] = mosi

                        state = IDLE
                    cnt.next = (cnt + 1) % n
                miso.next = sreg[n-1]

    return RX(), TX()
</pre></div><p>
The module interface contains some additional signals and
parameters. txdata is the input data word to be transmitted, and
txrdy toggles when a new word can be accepted. Similarly,
rxdata contains the received data word, and rxrdy toggles when
a new word has been received. Finally, there is a reset input,
rst_n, and a parameter n that defines the data word width.
</p><p>
Inside the SPI slave module, we create a signal, cnt, to keep track
of the serial cycle number. It uses an intbv object as its initial
value. intbv is a hardware-oriented class that works like an
integer with bit-level facilities. Python's indexing and slicing
interface can be used to access individual bits and slices. Also, an
intbv object can have a minimum and a maximum value.
</p><p>
The RX generator function describes the receive behavior. Whenever
the slave select line ss_n is active low, the mosi input is
shifted to the shift register sreg. The yield negedge(sclk)
statement indicates that the action occurs on the falling clock edge.
In the last serial cycle, the shift register is transferred to
the rxdata output and rxrdy toggles.
</p><p>
The TX generator function is slightly more complicated, because it
requires a small state machine to control the protocol. The yield
statement specifies two events in this case, meaning that the
generator is resumed on the event that occurs first. When the reset
input is active low, cnt and state are reset. In the other
case, the action depends on the state. In the IDLE state, we wait
until the select line goes active low before accepting the data word
for transmission and going to the TRANSFER state. In the
TRANSFER state, the shift register is shifted out serially. The
state machine maintains the proper serial cycle count and returns to
the IDLE state on the last shift.

Verification</h2></div></div><p>
The SPI slave module was modeled at a level that stays close to an
actual implementation. This is a good way to introduce MyHDL's
concepts. However, using MyHDL for this purpose doesn't provide a lot
of advantages over traditional HDLs. Instead, MyHDL's real value is
it makes the whole of Python available to hardware designers.
Python's expressive power, flexibility and extensive library offer
possibilities beyond the scope of traditional HDLs.
</p><p>
One area in which Python-like features are desirable is
verification. As with software, in hardware design, verification is
the hard part. It generally is acknowledged that traditional HDLs are
not up to the task. Consequently, yet another language type has
emerged, the hardware verification language (HVL). Once again, MyHDL
relies on Python to challenge this trend.
</p><p>
To set up a hardware verification environment, we first create a test
bench. This is a hardware module that instantiates the design under
test (DUT), together with data generators and checkers. Listing 2
shows a test bench for the SPI slave module. It instantiates the SPI
slave module together with an SPI tester module that controls all
interface pins. To be able to use multiple SPI tester modules that
verify various aspects of the design, the SPI tester module is a
parameter of the test bench.

    miso = Signal(bool(0))
    mosi = Signal(bool(0))
    sclk = Signal(bool(0))
    ss_n = Signal(INACTIVE_n)
    txrdy = Signal(bool(0))
    rxrdy = Signal(bool(0))
    rst_n = Signal(INACTIVE_n)
    txdata = Signal(intbv(0)[n:])
    rxdata = Signal(intbv(0)[n:])

    SPISlave_inst = traceSignals(SPISlave,
        miso, mosi, sclk, ss_n,
        txdata, txrdy, rxdata, rxrdy, rst_n, n=n)

    SPITester_inst = SPITester(
        miso, mosi, sclk, ss_n,
        txdata, txrdy, rxdata, rxrdy, rst_n, n=n)

    return SPISlave_inst, SPITester_inst
</pre></div><p>
For the tests themselves, we use a unit testing framework. Unit
testing is a cornerstone of extreme programming (XP), a modern
software development methodology that is an intriguing mixture of
common sense and radically new ideas. The genuine XP approach is to
develop the test first, before the implementation. XP is a
useful methodology, but its lessons virtually are ignored by the
hardware design community. With MyHDL, Python's unit testing framework,
unittest, can be used for test-driven hardware development.
</p><p>
Listing 3 shows test code for the SPI slave module. Tests are defined
in a subclass of the unittest.TestCase class. Each method name
with the prefix test corresponds to an actual test, but other methods
can be written to support the tests. A typical test suite consists of
multiple tests and test cases, but we describe a single test to
demonstrate the idea.

The RXTester method is a generator function designed for a basic
test of the SPI slave receive path. It contains a local generator function,
stimulus, that transmits a data word on the SPI bus as a
master. Another local generator function, check, checks whether
the data word is received correctly by the slave. The complete test
consists of a number of random data word transfers. For each data
word, we create a stimulus and a check generator. To wait for their
completion, MyHDL allows us to put them in a yield statement. For
proper synchronization, we want to continue only when both
generators have completed. This functionality is accomplished by the
join function.
</p><p>
When we run the test program, the output indicates which tests fail at
what point. When everything works, the output from our small example
is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python test_SPISlave.py -v

Waveform Viewing</h2></div></div><p>
MyHDL supports waveform viewing, a popular way to visualize hardware
behavior. In Listing 2, the instantiation of the SPI slave module is
wrapped in a call to the function traceSignals. As a side effect,
signal changes are dumped to a file during simulation, in a standard
format. Figure 1 shows a sample of the waveforms rendered by
gtkwave, an open-source waveform viewer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7542f1.large.jpg"><img src="7542f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

signals as the test suite runs.

Links to Other HDLs</h2></div></div><p>
MyHDL is a practical solution with links to other HDLs. MyHDL
supports co-simulation with other HDL simulators that have an
interface to the operating system. A bridge must be implemented for
each simulator. This has been done for the open-source Verilog
simulators Icarus and cver.
</p><p>
In addition, an implementation-oriented subset of MyHDL code can be
converted automatically into Verilog. This is done with a function
called toVerilog, which is used in the same way as the traceSignals function
described earlier. The resulting code can be used in a standard design
flow, for example, to synthesize it automatically into an
implementation.

Epilogue</h2></div></div><p>
Tim Peters, a famous Python guru, explains his love for Python with
the paradoxical statement, &ldquo;Python code is easy to throw
away.&rdquo; In the same spirit, MyHDL aims to be the hardware design
tool of choice to experiment with new ideas.
