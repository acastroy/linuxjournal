We covered the fundamentals of permissions
last month. Now it's time to learn some useful
bits to make cooperation among users convenient
and secure.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last time, we looked at file and directory permissions from the ground
up&mdash;what users and groups are and how to set and remove read, write
and execute permissions on files and directories. In this column, we
look at some more advanced types of permissions, explore permission
numeric modes and the command umask and see how to delegate root's
authority with su and sudo.
This article contains more intermediate-level information than last
month's, but hopefully it should make sense, even if all
you know about permissions is what you read here last time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e3f8"></a>
The Sticky Bit</h2></div></div><p>
Recall last month's long listing of the extreme_casseroles/ directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxr-x--- 8  biff drummers 288 Mar 25 01:38 extreme_casseroles
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e558"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recall also that we set the group permissions on
this directory to r-x, that is, group-readable and
group-executable, so that our fellow members of the
drummers group could enter this directory and enjoy
the recipes stored therein.
</p><p>
Suppose that our drummer friend Biff wants to allow his fellow drummers
not only to read his recipes but to add their own as well. As we saw last time,
all he needs to do is set the group-write bit for this directory,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod g+w ./extreme_casseroles
</pre>
</p><p>
There's only one problem with doing that, however. Write permissions include both
the ability to create new files in this directory and also to delete
them. What's to stop one of his drummer pals from deleting other people's
recipes? The sticky bit, that's what.
</p><p>
In olden times, the sticky bit was used to write a file (program) to
memory so it would load more quickly when invoked. On Linux, however, it
serves a different function. When you set the sticky bit on a directory,
it limits people's ability to delete things in that directory. That is,
to delete a given file in the directory you either must own that file
or own the directory, even if you belong to the group that owns the
directory and group-write permissions are set on it.
</p><p>
To set the sticky bit, issue the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +t <i>directory_name</i>
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In our example, this would be <tt  >chmod +t
extreme_casseroles</tt>. If we now
do a long listing of the directory itself, by using ls with the -d option
to list the directory's permissions rather than its contents, that is,
<tt  >ls -ld extreme_casseroles</tt>, we see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxrwx--T 8  biff drummers  288  Mar 25 01:38 extreme_casseroles
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the T at the end of the permissions. We'd normally expect
to see either x or - there, depending on whether the directory is
other-writable. The T denotes that the directory is not other-executable
and has the sticky bit set. A lowercase t would denote that the
directory is other-executable and has the sticky bit set.
</p><p>
To illustrate what effect this restriction has, suppose a listing of the contents
of extreme_casseroles/ looks like Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262eb88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Contents of extreme_casseroles/
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
drwxrwxr-T  3 biff drummers  192 2004-08-10 23:39 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 biff drummers 4008 2004-08-10 23:39 ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 biff drummers   18 2004-07-08 07:40 chocolate_turkey_casserole.txt
-rw-rw-r--  1 biff drummers   12 2004-08-08 15:10 pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt
drwxr-xr-x  2 biff drummers   80 2004-08-10 23:28 src
</pre></div><p>
Suppose further that the user crash tries to delete the file
pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt, which crash finds offensive. crash
expects this to work, because he belongs to the group drummers and
the group-write bit is set on this file.
Remember, though, that biff set the parent directory's sticky
bit. Therefore, crash's attempted deletion fails, as we see in Listing 2.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262ed98"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Attempting Deletion with Sticky Bit Set
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
crash&gt; rm pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt
rm: cannot remove `pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt':
Operation not permitted
</pre></div><p>
One more note on the sticky bit: it only applies to the directory's
first level downward. In Listing 1, you may have noticed that besides
the two nasty recipes, extreme_casseroles/ also contains another
directory, src. The contents of src will not be affected by
extreme_casseroles' sticky bit, although the directory src itself
is. If biff wants to protect src's contents from group deletion, he
needs to set src's own sticky bit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262efa8"></a>
setuid and setgid</h2></div></div><p>
Now we come to two of the most dangerous permissions bits in the
world of UNIX and Linux, setuid and setgid. If set on an executable binary file, the
setuid bit causes that program to run as its owner, no matter who
executes it. Similarly, when set on an executable, the setgid bit
causes that program to run as a member of the group that owns it,
again regardless of who executes it.
</p><p>
When I say run as, I mean the program runs with the same privileges as. For example, suppose biff writes and compiles a C
program, killpms, that behaves the same as the command <tt  >rm
/extreme_casseroles/pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt</tt>. Suppose further
that biff sets the setuid bit on killpms, with the command <tt  >chmod +s
./killpms</tt> and also makes it group-executable. A long listing of killpms
might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-rwsr-xr--  1 biff drummers   22 2004-08-11 23:01 killpms
</pre>
</p><p>
If crash runs this program, he finally can succeed in his quest
to delete the Pineapple-Mushroom Surprise recipe: killpms runs as though biff had executed it. When killpms attempts to delete
pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt, it succeeds because the file has
user-write permissions and killpms is acting as its user/owner, biff.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262f268"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
IMPORTANT WARNING</b></p><p>
setuid and setgid are very dangerous
if set on any file owned by root or any other privileged account
or group. I'm illustrating setuid and setgid so you understand
what they do, not because I think you actually should use
them for anything important. The command sudo, described later in
this article, is a much better tool for delegating root's authority.
</p></div><p>
If you want a program to run setuid, that program must be
group-executable or other-executable for what I hope are obvious reasons.
In addition,
the Linux kernel ignores the setuid and setgid bits on shell
scripts. These bits work only on binary (compiled) executables.
</p><p>
setgid works the same way but with group permissions. If you
set the setgid bit on an executable file with the command <tt  >chmod g+s
<i>filename</i></tt>, and if the file also is other-executable (-r-xr-sr-x),
when that program is executed it runs with the group ID of the
file rather than of the user who executed it.
</p><p>
In the above example, if we change killpms' other permissions to r-x
(<tt  >chmod o+x killpms</tt>) and make it setgid
(<tt  >chmod g+s killpms</tt>), no
matter who executes killpms, killpms exercises the permissions of the
drummers group, because drummers is the group owner of killpms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262f688"></a>
setgid and Directories</h2></div></div><p>
What about directories? Well, setuid has no effect on directories,
but setgid does, and it's a little non-intuitive.
Normally, when you create a file, it's automatically owned by your user ID
and your (primary) group ID. For example, if biff creates a file, the file
has a user owner of biff and a group owner of drummers, assuming
that drummers is biff's primary group, as listed in /etc/passwd.
</p><p>
Setting a directory's setgid bit, however, causes any file created in
that directory to inherit the directory's group owner. This is useful
if users on your system tend to belong to secondary groups and routinely
create files that need to be shared with other members of those groups.
For example, if the user animal is listed in /etc/group as being a
secondary member of drummers but is listed in /etc/passwd has having
a primary group of muppets, then animal has no trouble creating
files in the extreme_casseroles/ directory, whose permissions are set
to <tt  >drwxrwx--T</tt>. However, by default, animal's files belong to the
group muppets, not to drummers, so unless animal manually reassigns his
files' group ownership (<tt  >chgrp drummers
<i>newfile</i></tt>) or resets their
other permissions (<tt  >chmod o+rw
<i>newfile</i></tt>), other members of
drummers cannot read or write animal's recipes.
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, biff or root sets the setgid bit on
extreme_casseroles/ (<tt  >chmod g+s extreme_casseroles</tt>), when animal
creates a new file therein, the file has a group owner of
drummers, exactly like extreme_casseroles/ itself.
All other permissions still apply; if the directory in question isn't
group-writable to begin with, the setgid bit has no effect,
because group members are not able to create files inside it.
</p><p>
Now we've covered all possible permissions: read, write, execute,
sticky bit, setuid and setgid. If you understand all six of these,
you're probably in the minority of Linux users. But wait, there's more!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262faa8"></a>
Numeric Modes</h2></div></div><p>
So far we've been using mnemonics to represent permissions&mdash;r for
read, w for write and so on. Needless to say, as with everything else,
your system actually uses numbers to represent permissions. The chmod
command recognizes both mnemonic permission modifiers (u+rwx,go-w)
and numeric modes.
</p><p>
A numeric mode consists of four digits: as you read left to right,
these represent special permissions, user permissions, group permissions
and other permissions. Recall that other is short for other
users not covered by user permissions or group permissions. For example,
0700 translates to no special permissions set, all user permissions set,
no group permissions set and no other permissions set.
</p><p>
Each permission has a numeric value, and the permissions in each
digit place are additive: the digit represents the sum of all
permission bits you want to set. If, for example, user permissions are
set to 7, this represents 4 (the value for read) plus 2 (the value
for write) plus 1 (the value for execute).
</p><p>
As I just mentioned, the basic numeric values are 4 for read, 2 for write
and 1 for execute. (I remember these by mentally repeating the phrase,
read-write-execute, 4-2-1.) Why no 3, you might wonder? Because this
way, no two combination of permissions have the same sum.
</p><p>
Special permissions are as follows: 4 stands for setuid, 2 stands for
setgid and 1 stands for sticky bit. For example, the numeric mode 3000
translates to setgid set, sticky bit set and no other permissions set,
which is, actually, a useless set of permissions.
</p><p>
Here's one more example of a numeric mode. If I issue the command
<tt  >chmod 0644 mycoolfile</tt>, I am setting the
permissions of mycoolfile, as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7727f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Permissions for mycoolfile
</p></div></div><p>
For a more complete discussion of numeric modes, see the info page
for coreutils, node Numeric Modes. That is, enter the command <tt  >info
coreutils numeric</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28278"></a>
umask</h2></div></div><p>
I want to cover one last command specific to permissions
before closing with a couple of other topics. umask is a
command built into the bash shell that prints or sets your default
permissions mask. To see yours, simply enter the umask command without
any arguments; it returns a four-digit number. On my system, it
looks like Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28380"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Checking My Default Permissions Mask
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
mick@localhost:/home/mick&gt; umask
0022
</pre></div><p>
Mode 0022 means no special permissions, no user-owner permissions,
group and other permissions set to write, right? How can that be?
</p><p>
Actually, umask deals in masks, not in modes per se. 0022 is what is
subtracted from the number 0777 to determine the numeric mode of
files you create: 0777 &ndash; 0022 = 0755.
</p><p>
Aha! So, files I create have user-owner permissions set to
read-write-execute (7 = 4 + 2 + 1) and group and other permissions set to
read-execute (5 = 4 + 1)? Right?
Almost. It also happens that umask sets the execute bit
automatically only on directories. Even if your permissions mask includes
execute permissions, the execute bit does not set automatically on
regular files you create.
So, if my permissions mask is 0022, resulting in default permissions
of 0755, and I create a file named default_file and a directory named
default_dir, long listing output for those two items look like
Listing 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28640"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. File and Directory with Mask of 0022
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
-rwxr-xr-x   2 mick users      48 2004-08-13 08:31 default_dir
-rw-r--r--   1 mick users       4 2004-08-13 08:31 default_file
</pre></div><p>
To change your default permissions mask, simply issue the command umask
with the new mask as its argument. For example, if I want all my files to
have group-read permissions but no other permissions, this translates
to a numeric mode of 0740. If I subtract that from 0777 I get a mask of
0037. Therefore, the umask command I enter is <tt  >umask
0037</tt>.
This new mask, however, applies only to my current session and any
new shells I start from it. To make it persistent, I can add the line
<tt  >umask 0037</tt> to my .bashrc file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28900"></a>
su and sudo</h2></div></div><p>
I should say a few words about the reality of users, groups and
permissions. The whole problem with UNIX security is that far too often,
permissions and authority on a given system boil down to root can do
anything, although users can't do much of anything.
</p><p>
Sadly, it's much easier to do a quick <tt  >su -</tt> to become root for
a while than it is to create a granular system of group memberships and
permissions that allows administrators and sub-administrators to have
exactly the permissions they need. Sure, you can use the su command
with the -c option, which allows you to specify a single command to
run as root rather than an entire shell session (for example, <tt  >su -c rm
<i>somefile.txt</i></tt>), but this requires you to enter the root password. It's
never good for more than a small number of people to know root's password.
</p><p>
Another approach to solving the root-takes-all problem is to use
role-based access control (RBAC) systems, such as SELinux, which enforce
access controls that reduce root's effective authority. However, this
makes things even more complicated than setting up effective groups and
group permissions. This is not to say that SELinux and the rest aren't good
things&mdash;I love RBAC.
</p><p>
A better middle ground is to use the sudo command. sudo is short for
superuser do, and it allows users to execute single commands as root,
without actually needing to know the root password. sudo
is now a standard package on most Linux distributions.
</p><p>
sudo is configured with the file /etc/sudoers, but
you shouldn't edit this file directly. Rather,
use the visudo command, which opens a editor
on the file; vi is the editor by default. You can use a different
editor by setting the EDITOR environment variable.
For example, to use /usr/bin/gedit, do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/gedit
</pre>
</p><p>
Space doesn't permit me to explain sudoers' syntax in detail; see the sudoers(5), sudo(8) and visudo(8) man pages
for complete information. In the space available here, let's run through
a quick example.
</p><p>
Remember the user crash's quest to rid the world of Pineapple-Mushroom Surprise? Although in this case it would be overkill&mdash;the
permissions techniques I've already illustrated are sufficient&mdash;you could
use sudo to allow crash to realize his goal, assuming you (biff) have
root privileges.
First, become root (<tt  >su -</tt>). Next, execute the command
<tt  >visudo</tt>. You're
now in a vi session, editing the file /etc/sudoers; see the vi(1) man page
if you're new to vi. Go down to the bottom of the file and add this
line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
crash localhost=/bin/rm /home/biff/extreme_casseroles/pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28e80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Save and exit the file.
</p><p>
Now, to do his thing, crash enters the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo rm /home/biff/extreme_casseroles/pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a29038"></a></h2></div></div><p>
whereupon he is prompted to enter his password. After
he enters this correctly, the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/rm /home/biff/extreme_casseroles/pineapple_mushroom_surprise.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a29198"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is executed as root, and the offending file is gone.
</p><p>
Alternately, the line in /etc/sudoers could look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
crash localhost=/bin/rm /home/biff/extreme_casseroles/*
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a29350"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That way, crash can delete anything in extreme_casseroles/,
regardless of the sticky bit setting.
</p><p>
As handy as it is, sudo is a powerful tool, so use it wisely; root
privileges never should be trifled with. It really is better to use user
and group permissions judiciously than to hand out root privileges, even
with sudo. Better still, use an RBAC-based system such as SELinux
if the stakes are high enough.
</p><p>
That's it for now. I hope you've found this tutorial useful. Until
next time, be safe!
