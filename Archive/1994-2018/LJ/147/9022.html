Autodesk's Discreet Inferno</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, friends, admit it. Like your humble editor, you've closeted a secret
wish to work at Pixar ever since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Toy Story</em></span> first came out. Should you
ever beat me to that dream job creating animated films or special effects,
you'll feel right at home with the omnipresent Linux applications that
bring everything to life. A case in point is Autodesk's new Linux port
of Discreet Inferno 6.5, an interactive design system for high-resolution
visual effects. Discreet Inferno has been used for high-speed compositing
and advanced graphics applications in films and television shows, such
as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CSI New York</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stargate:
Atlantis</em></span> and many others. Interestingly (but
not surprisingly), Autodesk first created a Linux version of Discreet
Inferno just for Japan, which was such a blockbuster that it was released
worldwide. In addition, according to a VP at Autodesk, the Discreet
Inferno system on the Linux workstation &ldquo;can offer up to five times the
performance (per CPU) of previous SGI platforms such as the Onyx
2.&rdquo;
So, good people of Autodesk, now that Linux has handily rocked your world,
there's this little program called AutoCAD....

ippimail's Free E-mail Service</h2></div></div><p>
Just say &ldquo;ippimail&rdquo;&mdash;the name of a new and free e-mail
service&mdash;five
times fast and you'll be hooked too. If the name alone doesn't grab you,
the ippimail gang hopes that saving the world will. Here's how it
works. ippimail's mission is to get as many people as possible to join
its free, Hotmail-esque e-mail service, which utilizes 100% open-source
technology. The more eyeballs it gets, the more banner advertising
it can support. The firm then donates 45% of its profits to worthy
charities and an additional 10% to the Open Source Development community.
Though most of the charities are on its home turf in the United Kingdom,
many work globally, and ippimail pledges to support charities wherever
its users are. In addition, ippimail sees this project as a clever way
to evangelize about the benefits of open source to the broader public.
It's motto &ldquo;feelgood email&rdquo; seems to hit the nail right on the head.

Kangaroo Media's Kangaroo.TV</h2></div></div><p>
It's official, folks&mdash;Linux has gone Joe Sixpack. That's because our
beloved OS has infiltrated the world of NASCAR autoracing. Embedded Linux
is the horsepower under the hood of Kangaroo.TV, a new device available
for rental at NASCAR events that gives spectators a more entertaining
autoracing experience. Marketed as NASCAR NEXTEL FanView, this wireless,
handheld gadget provides racing fans a slew of event information,
including ten live MPEG-4 video feeds (replays, highlights and in-car
views), 64 AC3 audio feeds (driver-to-pit conversations and commentary)
and a plethora of real-time stats. Kangaroo.TV utilized Trolltech's
Qtopia as its application platform and GUI. You can give Kangaroo.TV
a whirl for $50 US a day, coming to a racetrack near you.

Micro/sys' SBC1491-ET</h2></div></div><p>
If your itch involves PC/104 single-board computers that boot quickly and
can handle extreme heat and cold, Micro/sys' new SBC1491-ET might be the
scratch. This mid-range, full-featured PC/104 (3.55 x 3.775) computer
has a sub-five-second boot-up time and will operate in the temperature range
of &ndash;40&deg;C to +85&deg;C. The SBC1491-ET offers standard PC features
such as SVGA, dual serial ports and 10BASE-T Ethernet support, as well as
64MB of RAM, up to 576MB solid-state Flash and full AT-compatibility.
Micro/sys claims that this product is ideal &ldquo;for applications not
requiring Pentium speed&rdquo; and offers PC compatibility while generating
less heat, using less power and costing less. The processor is an STPC
Atlas with operating speeds of 120MHz to 133MHz. Software development
packages for the SBC1491-ET include Linux, Windows CE, VxWorks and DOS.
Ahoy, Antarctica or bust!

Solsoft's NetFilterOne</h2></div></div><p>
<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s security czar, Mick Bauer, has opined numerous times that
a good Netfilter firewall GUI is not just a crutch for the less technical
among us, but rather a tool that makes all of us IT administrators work
more intelligently. Solsoft recently upgraded its own Netfilter GUI,
NetFilterOne. The application is a centralized interface from which
one can configure, deploy, enforce and audit rules and policies among
Netfilter firewalls. The shiny new Version 1.2 offers the following three
key new features: a new Tabular Policy Editor that allows users to manage
all permissions in a unified view; bridge mode, also called transparent
mode by other providers; and support for Linux Netfilter iptables-1.3.x.
A free trial of NetFilterOne is available at Solsoft's Web site.

Arkeia Software's Network Backup</h2></div></div><p>
If your backup duties include files and directories named with non-Latin
characters, you're in luck. Arkeia Software's newly released Network
Backup Version 5.5 adds full support for Unicode/UTF-8 characters in the
backup index. Unicode supports characters from all the world's major
languages and is most commonly applied to languages such as Japanese,
Chinese and Arabic.

Heroix's Longitude</h2></div></div><p>
Heroix has upgraded its Longitude agentless performance monitoring
and reporting software. The application is intended to monitor an
enterprise's entire IT infrastructure, including OS, Web, database, J2EE,
messaging, infrastructure, and user and business metrics, all right out of
the box and without agent software on monitored computers. Innovations
in Version 3 are event correlation across the entire infrastructure,
enhanced SLA management via a new graphical event monitor, adjustable
workload threshold settings to eliminate false alarms and a range of
added monitoring coverage (Cisco devices, Dell OpenManage, HP Systems
Insight Manager and SNMP device checking). Platforms monitored are
Red Hat and SUSE Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. A 14-day
free trial is available at Heroix's Web site.
