It's a crime not to mashup two or more Web services to deliver more than
they can deliver separately.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2651580.0x2749348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we started to look at the Google Maps API, which allows us
to embed dynamic (and Ajax-enabled) maps into our Web
applications. That article demonstrated how easy it is to create such
maps, with markers on the screen.
</p><p>
This month, we try something far more
ambitious. Specifically, we're going to join the ranks of those
creating mashups, combinations of Web services that often (but not
always) have a mapping component. A mashup is a combination of two
or more Web APIs in a novel way, making information more
accessible and informative than it would be on its own.
</p><p>
One of the first mashups I saw was the Chicago crime map. The
Chicago Police Department publishes a regular bulletin of crimes that
have taken place within the city, and their approximate locations.
Using this map, you can determine how safe your block is from crime,
as well as look for patterns in other areas of the city. This mashup
took information from the Chicago Police Department's public
information and displayed it on a Google Maps page.
</p><p>
I was living in Chicago at the time it came out, and (of course) used
the listing to find out just how safe my neighborhood was. The
information always had been available from the police department, but
it was only in the context of a mapping application that I really
was able to understand and internalize this data. And indeed, this is
one of the important lessons mashups have taught us&mdash;that the
synthesis of information and an accessible graphic display, can make
a great deal of difference to end users.
</p><p>
When mapping software was first made available, there was no official
way to use the maps for unofficial purposes. A number of enterprising
developers looked at the JavaScript used to create the maps
and reverse-engineered APIs for their own use. Google, as well as
Yahoo and MapQuest, have since released APIs that make it possible for
us to create mapping applications using their systems. This has made
mashups with maps even more popular than ever, with a growing number
of Web sites and blogs examining them.
</p><p>
This month, I demonstrate a simple mashup of Google Maps with
Amazon's used-book service. The application will be relatively simple.
A user will enter an ISBN, and a Google map of the United States will
soon be displayed. Markers will be placed on the map indicating
several of the locations where used copies of the book are available.
Thus, if copies of a book are available in New York City, Chicago and
San Francisco, we will see three markers on the map, one in each city.
In this way, we'll see how two different Web APIs, from two different
companies, can be brought together to create an interesting and useful
display for end users.
</p><p>
This month's code examples assume you already have signed up for
an Amazon Web services ID, as well as for a Google Maps ID.
Information on where to acquire these IDs is available in the on-line Resources
for this article.

A Simple Map</h2></div></div><p>
Our first challenge is to create a map that contains one graphic
marker for each location in a list. We already saw how to do this
last month using PHP. This month, we begin by converting the
program to ERB, an ASP- or PHP-style template that uses Ruby instead
of another language. You can see the file, mashup.rhtml, in Listing
1.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

    var map = new GMap(document.getElementById("map"));
    map.centerAndZoom(new GPoint(-87.740070, 42.037030), 13);

    map.addControl(new GSmallMapControl());
    map.addControl(new GMapTypeControl());

&lt;% array = [-87.740070, -87.730000] %&gt;
&lt;% array.each_with_index do |item, index| %&gt;

    var myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt; = new GMarker(new GPoint(&lt;%= item %&gt;,
42.037030));
    map.addOverlay(myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt;);

&lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are the locations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;% array.each do |item| %&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= item %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
One way to parse ERB files correctly on a server is by
running Ruby on Rails, which uses ERB as a default templating
mechanism. But for a small mashup like this, using Rails would be
overkill. So, I decided to use a simple ERB (Embedded Ruby, for
HTML-Ruby templates) by itself.
</p><p>
To make this work, I installed eruby in the cgi-bin
directory of my server (see Resources). I
then told Apache that any file with an .rhtml extension should be
parsed with eruby:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AddType application/x-httpd-eruby .rhtml
Action application/x-httpd-eruby /cgi-bin/eruby
</pre>
</p><p>
After restarting the server, I was able to create HTML-Ruby templates
without any problems, so long as they had an .rhtml extension. The
file in Listing 1, mashup.rhtml, was a simple attempt at using my
HTML-Ruby template to create a map. As with all Google Maps
applications, our final output will be a page of HTML, including some
JavaScript that invokes functions downloaded from the Google Maps
server. Our Ruby code will be outputting JavaScript code, which
will then execute in the user's browser.
</p><p>
To demonstrate that we can indeed do this for two fixed points, the
ERB file defines an array of two latitudes, both within a short
distance of my home in Skokie, Illinois:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% array = [-87.740070, -87.730000] %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Next, we iterate over the elements of this array, using the
each_with_index method to get both the array element and the index
within the array that we are currently on:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% array.each_with_index do |item, index| %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have both the latitude and a unique number for it, we can
output some JavaScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">

var myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt; = new GMarker(new GPoint(&lt;%= item%&gt;, 42.037030));
map.addOverlay(myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt;);

</pre>
</p><p>
What is happening in the above code isn't hard to understand, but it
might be a bit complicated when you first read it. Basically, each
iteration of our loop declares a new JavaScript variable. The
first iteration creates myMarker0, and the second creates
myMarker1. This is possible because we have the index of the current
Ruby array element, and because we have made sure not to insert any
spaces between myMarker and the Ruby output &lt;%= index %&gt;.
</p><p>
The myMarkerX variable is then defined to be a new instance of
GMarker&mdash;that is, a marker on the Google map&mdash;located at a point
defined by the latitude (the item variable) and longitude (a fixed
value, 42.037030).
</p><p>
Finally, so that the user can see exactly where all of the points are, we
print some text at the bottom of the page. The result is a map with
two markers on it, and the location of each marker is listed in text.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2651580.0x2749df0"></a>
Working with Addresses and Cities</h2></div></div><p>
This map is a nice start, but far from what we want to
accomplish. And, one of the biggest impediments is the fact that
Google Maps expects to get longitude/latitude pairs. Amazon's Web
service does return information about third-party vendors, but it
provides us with city and state information. So, we need a way
to translate city and state names into latitude and longitude.
</p><p>
The easiest way to do this is to rely on someone else, who can
translate an address into a longitude/latitude pair. Such geocoder
services exist as Web services on the Internet; some of them are
freely available, and others charge money. One of the best-known free
geocoder services is at geocoder.us. To use this geocoder, we simply
use a REST-style URL, as follows:
http://geocoder.us/service/rest?address=ADDRESS, replacing ADDRESS with the place we want to go. For example, to
find my house, we would say,
http://geocoder.us/service/rest?address=9120+Niles+Center+Road+Skokie+IL.
</p><p>
The geocoder service returns an XML document that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;geo:Point rdf:nodeID="aid77952462"&gt;
    &lt;dc:description&gt;9120 Niles Center Rd, Skokie IL 60076&lt;/dc:description&gt;
    &lt;geo:long&gt;-87.743874&lt;/geo:long&gt;
    &lt;geo:lat&gt;42.046517&lt;/geo:lat&gt;
&lt;/geo:Point&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Because the longitude and latitude are nicely compartmentalized inside
of the XML, it's easy to extract it in our program and then insert it
into the JavaScript that we generate. However, from looking through
the geocoder.us documentation, it doesn't seem as though it is able to
handle city names (that is, without street addresses).
</p><p>
Luckily, at least one free geocoder service handles city
names, returning a similarly styled XML document. We submit the name
of a city as follows, once again using a REST-style request:
http://brainoff.com/geocoder/rest?city=Skokie,IL,US.
</p><p>
We get the following result:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;geo:Point&gt;
    &lt;geo:long&gt;-87.762660&lt;/geo:long&gt;
    &lt;geo:lat&gt;42.034680&lt;/geo:lat&gt;
&lt;/geo:Point&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the longitude and latitude points we got back
from this query are slightly different. If we were looking to create
a map for driving directions, this would be of greater importance.
But, we already know that we'll be looking at the entire map of the
United States for this application, and that being blocks away, or
even two miles away, won't make any difference.

        &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= city['latitude'] %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
We can now update our ERB file, such that it has an array of cities,
rather than longitude/latitude pairs, as you can see in Listing 2. We
begin the file by importing two Ruby classes that will be needed to
handle this additional functionality:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% require 'net/http' %&gt;
&lt;% require 'rexml/document' %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Although our starting (and centering) point begins at the same
longitude/latitude location, we begin at zoom level 13, which will be
large enough to show all of the cities.
</p><p>
We then define four cities, putting them in an array called cities,
showing four of the US cities in which I have lived. Notice that each
element of this array is a string containing a city name, state
abbreviation and US (for United States). Also note that when the city
name has a space, we must replace it with a + sign (or
%20), so the Web service request works appropriately:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% cities = ["Skokie,IL,US", "Longmeadow,MA,US",
     "Somerville,MA,US", "Old+Westbury,NY,US"] %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
We then iterate through these cities, using each as the argument to
our Web service geocoder:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% geocoder_response =
    Net::HTTP.get_response('brainoff.com', "/geocoder/rest/?city=#{city}") %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The results of the geocoder Web service are in XML, as we saw earlier.
To extract the results of this query from the XML, we use the
REXML library that comes with Ruby. This allows us to retrieve the
geo:long and geo:lat elements, and then grab the textual
contents of the elements:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% longitude = xml.root.elements["/rdf:RDF/geo:Point/geo:long"].text %&gt;
&lt;% latitude = xml.root.elements["/rdf:RDF/geo:Point/geo:lat"].text %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Having done the hard work, we now insert the appropriate JavaScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">

    var myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt; = new GMarker(new GPoint(&lt;%= longitude %&gt;,
&lt;%= latitude %&gt;));
    map.addOverlay(myMarker&lt;%= index %&gt;);

</pre>
</p><p>
Along the way, we collect city names and locations into an array named
final_list. We can then use this to produce a list at the end of the
document:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% final_list.each do |city| %&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= city['city'] %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= city['longitude'] %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= city['latitude'] %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, this produces a page with a Google map showing all
of those locations, and with a list at the bottom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2651580.0x274a898"></a>
Adding Amazon Information</h2></div></div><p>
Although the above is nice to have, the city information is still
hard-coded. What we want is to be able to retrieve information about
third-party sellers of a particular book. This means we must get
an ISBN from the user, ask Amazon for third-party sellers of that
book, and then get the city and state in which each of those sellers
resides. Our code will remain largely the same, except for the
way we define the cities array, which will be far more
complicated. You can see the resulting code in Listing 3.

Getting an ISBN from the end user is fairly straightforward. At the
top of the file, we import the CGI class:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% require 'cgi' %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now we can retrieve an ISBN that the user entered:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% cgi = CGI.new %&gt;
&lt;% isbn = cgi['isbn'] %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
We use this ISBN to find all of the third-party sellers with a
copy of this book. (Actually, we're going to look at only up to ten of
the third-party vendors; Amazon returns only ten items at a time, and
we won't complicate our code by looking for additional pages of
results.) We take each returned vendor and put it into our vendors
array.
</p><p>
So, let's start by getting information about vendors of used copies of
our book. We do this by sending Amazon a REST request for our ISBN:

<pre     class="programlisting">

amazon_params = {'Service' =&gt; 'AWSECommerceService',
 'Operation' =&gt; 'ItemLookup',
 'AWSAccessKeyId' =&gt; 'XXX',
 'ItemId' =&gt; isbn,
 'ResponseGroup' =&gt; 'Medium,OfferFull',
 'MerchantId' =&gt; 'All'}.map {|key,value|
 "#{key}=#{value}"}.join("&amp;")

amazon_response = Net::HTTP.get_response('webservices.amazon.com',
                                        '/onca/xml?' &lt;&lt;
                                        amazon_params)

</pre>
</p><p>
The above is my preferred technique for keeping track of names and
values, especially when I'm passing a lot of them&mdash;I create a hash,
joining the keys and values with = signs, and then the pairs
themselves with ampersands (&amp; signs). This gives me a string that I
can hand to Amazon.
</p><p>
The XML response that I get back then contains a lot of information,
including details about each offer. That's actually all I care about here;
I'm not keeping track of the price of the book (which would be useful,
of course), but rather the location of each used copy we can
grab. But we can't get that right away; the ItemLookup request
gets us only the seller IDs and some basic information about each one.
We'll need to grab the seller ID from each offer node, then use
that to perform a second Amazon request, obtaining information about the
vendor:

<pre     class="programlisting">

xml.root.elements.each("Items/Item/Offers/Offer/Seller/SellerId") do
|seller|
 # Now get information about each vendor
  amazon_vendor_params = {'Service' =&gt; 'AWSECommerceService',
      'Operation' =&gt; 'SellerLookup',
      'AWSAccessKeyId' =&gt; 'XXX',
      'SellerId' =&gt; seller.text}.map {|key,value|
      "#{key}=#{value}"}.join("&amp;")

  vendor_response = Net::HTTP.get_response('webservices.amazon.com',
                                               '/onca/xml?' &lt;&lt;
                                               amazon_vendor_params)
  vendor_xml = REXML::Document.new(vendor_response.body)

</pre>
</p><p>
This code sends a request to Amazon, gets an XML body back,
and then looks for the City and State elements that a vendor will
produce. Unfortunately, there's no fast and easy way to deal with
countries outside of the United States, both with geocoding and with
Amazon. Amazon's assumption seems to be that Canada is sort of like
the United States, which is false. So, we'll always get the city and
state and assume that it is in the United States. If our assumption
turns out to be wrong, we'll allow ourselves to be corrected by
the geocoder.
</p><p>
As we have grabbed information about each vendor, we have stuck
the city and state information in the cities array. Now we're going
to use that same array, just as we did in mashup2.rhtml&mdash;except now,
the source is not a hard-coded list, but rather one that we put
together from Amazon information. We had to make only two changes for
things to work: a check that we didn't get nil from the geocoder
(indicating there was an error, often because the vendor is in
Canada), and a use of gsub to change space characters into + signs in
the city name.
</p><p>
The results are quite nice to see, even if they're incomplete and a
bit on the crude side: By going to a URL such as
http://maps.lerner.co.il/mashup3.rhtml?isbn=0812931432,
we can see where a number of used copies are located in the United
States. This doesn't necessarily reflect the cost of the book, its
condition, or the shipping charges&mdash;but it can be fun and
interesting to see where different books have ended up, and which
cities tend to have more (and fewer) used books.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Creating mashups, combinations of existing Web services, can be a
great deal of fun, and can make it easier to see patterns in data by
putting them on a map. It requires that you have a good understanding
of the underlying technologies and their quirks&mdash;but with a bit of
work, you'll see that creating such mashups can be fun and exciting,
and even entertaining. Moreover, as the Web becomes increasingly
interconnected, and as applications continue to blur the distinction
between the desktop and the Web, we should expect to see more of such
mashups, rather than fewer of them.
