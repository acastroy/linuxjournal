If Congress doesn't favor Net Neutrality, what are our options?

Four years ago this month, in July 2002, Lawrence Lessig gave a landmark
talk at OSCON called &ldquo;Free
Culture&rdquo; (see the on-line Resources). In it, he detailed the damage caused to technology and culture
by the insane growth of software patents, the limitless enlargement
of copyright protection and other absurdities burned into law by
clueless congresscritters. And, he chided us for doing nothing about it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In an interview two days ago, [retiring Congressman J.C.] Watts
said, &ldquo;Here's the problem with Washington: if you are explaining,
you are losing.&rdquo; It's a bumper-sticker culture. People have to
get it like <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>, and if they don't, if it takes three seconds to
make them understand, you're off their radar screen. Three seconds
to understand, or you lose. This is our problem. Six years after
this battle began, we're still explaining. We're still explaining
and we are losing. They frame this as a massive battle to stop
theft, to protect property. They don't get why re-architecting the
network destroys innovation and creativity. They extend copyrights
perpetually. They don't get how that in itself is a form of theft. A
theft of our common culture. We have failed in getting them to see
what the issues here are and that's why we live in this place where
a tradition speaks of freedom and their controls take it away.
</p><p>
Now, I've spent two years talking to you. To us. About this. And
we've not done anything yet. A lot of energy building sites and
blogs and Slashdot stories. [But] nothing yet to change that vision
in Washington. Because we hate Washington, right? Who would waste
his time in Washington?
</p><p>
But if you don't do something now, this freedom that you built, that
you spend your life coding, this freedom will be taken away. Either
by those who see you as a threat, who then invoke the system of law
we call patents, or by those who take advantage of the extraordinary
expansion of control that the law of copyright now gives them over
innovation. Either of these two changes through law will produce a
world where your freedom has been taken away. And, If You Can't
Fight For Your Freedom...You Don't Deserve It.
</p><p>
But you've done nothing.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ah, but now we have. In 2005, our bumper sticker appeared and became a
rallying cry for pro-Net legislation. It's name: Net Neutrality. The
idea is that networks should be open and without prejudice about what
they carry. In the container cargo system of moving packets that
comprises the Net, contents of containers should be of no interest to
those who own and operate the various parts of the system.
</p><p>
This week, as I write this (in early April), many pro-Neutrality advocates
(including myself) have just finished gathering at David Isenberg's Freedom To Connect (F2C)
Conference in Washington, DC (see Resources). And they haven't
been alone. The Big Boys missing in action when Larry Lessig gave his
talk have been all over the case. Amazon, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft,
among others, have been lobbying Congress to protect the Net's
neutrality. Vint Cerf, one of the Net's fathers (and now VP and Chief
Internet Evangelist at Google) said this in his prepared statement for a
Senate commerce committee hearing on Net Neutrality:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Allowing broadband carriers to control what people see and do on-line
would fundamentally undermine the principles that have made the
Internet such a success. For the foreseeable future, most Americans
will face little choice among broadband carriers. Enshrining a rule
that permits carriers to discriminate in favor of certain kinds or
sources of services would place those carriers in control of on-line
activity. Allowing broadband carriers to reserve huge amounts of
bandwidth for their own services will not give consumers the
broadband Internet our country and economy need. Promoting an open
and accessible Internet is critical for consumers.
</p><p>
Google believes that consumers should be able to use the Internet
connections that they pay for in the way that they want. This
principle&mdash;that users pick winners and losers in the Internet marketplace,
not carriers&mdash;is an architectural and policy choice critical to
innovation on-line. Google itself is a product of the Internet. We
care passionately about the future of the Net, not just for
ourselves, but because of all the other potential Googles out there.
Indeed, we are not alone. Our concerns are shared by Internet
companies, small businesses, end users and consumer groups across
the country. The vibrant ecosystem of innovation that lies at the
heart of the Internet creates wealth and opportunity for millions of
Americans. That ecosystem&mdash;based upon a neutral open network&mdash;should be nourished and promoted.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
At F2C, Representative Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat, said he and
Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass) would introduce an amendment to the Telecom
Act rewrite (of the last Act, passed in 1996) that says that &ldquo;if a
telephone company or broadband provider of any kind decides to
prioritize any content, then they have to offer that same fast-lane
treatment to all content providers without charge.&rdquo;
</p><p>
This amendment, Boucher explained, would fortify Net Neutrality
provisions already in the bill. Those provisions would give the FCC
statutory authority to hear disputes relating to the commission's own
principles, which include former FCC Chairman Michael Powell's four
&ldquo;Internet Freedoms&rdquo; (to access content, to use applications, to attach
devices and to obtain service plan information), which have since been
watered down
under current chairman Kevin Martin (see Resources).
</p><p>
During the conference, however, it became clear that, although most of
those present agreed that Net Neutrality is a Good Thing to have, there
was little agreement about the wisdom of burning it into law. I was one
of those whose advocacy of
Net Neutrality is tempered by misgivings about burning it into law (see
Resources for a link to my article on the <i  >LJ</i> Web site).
That's what I said on stage at the show (during a two-person panel with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> co-author David Weinberger). Another who took the same general
position was Michael Powell, who spoke the next day. I recorded some of
what Powell said. Here's an excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
First...there is a very shallow current understanding of tech. If
you go give a quiz about the seven layers of the Internet&mdash;good
luck. So, be careful of inviting the legislative process when they
have a very <span   class="emphasis"><em>bad</em></span> understanding of the technical underpinnings.
Because the secondary consequences of their errors can be enormous.
</p><p>
Number two: be careful. You live by the sword, you die by the sword.
I'm a big believer in subversion or jujitsu when it comes to this
stuff. Which is: let the weight of inertia be on your side. Which
[means] I would rather try constantly to position my industry where
I succeed if government does nothing, versus positioning it in a way
where I need them to do something or I'm dead. Because, if you're in
a position where you desperately need to do something or you're
dead, start ordering your coffin and digging the plot....
</p><p>
And the other thing is, do you believe in a snapshot of time, you
can trust the government&mdash;who, by the way, will have a vague
definition because they don't get it well enough? If
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span>
community doesn't understand it, as I heard...I can tell you right
now, very few people in Washington do. This means you're going to
get a potentially very ambiguous, subject to massive variations in
interpretation, pile of law.
</p><p>
Now, personalities change, political power changes, congressmen come
and go, and presidents change. You're living with something that's a
perpetual cycle of interpretation. And, by the way, it's always
easier to get a law on the books than ever to get it off again. If
it goes on, be prepared that it's there for 15 to 20 years.
And the other thing is, government has a way of turning on people.
Ask Bill Gates. It may be about networks today,
but those same principles can be used against innovative business
models and applications in other contexts. And, I submit to you they
<span   class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> be. It might have to do with the interoperability of your new
product with somebody else's product. It might have to do with servers
and caching. Someone will think it's a good idea to apply the same
basic principles to the other side of the community.
</p><p>
Third, and lastly for the moment, I would say, be careful because
you're playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> game. Regulatory battles are an
art form, and
these guys are the maestros. It's always a little like Br'er Rabbit.
&ldquo;Oh, woe is me. Throw me on the briar patch and don't regu&mdash;oh,
regulate me.&rdquo; Uch. The average one of these incumbents, whether a
cable or a phone company, have 40 lawyers in Washington dedicated to this work. Resources. Ability. One hundred years of
skill. I'm not criticizing, only stating a reality. And, then I meet
entrepreneurs who have 12 guys and can't afford a legal cost
center to do research. Then, let me add the judicial process. Every
decision you get from the Congress and the FCC will spend the next
three and a half to four years in court.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The next day, Boucher and Markey's amendment was shot down, on partisan
lines, 23&ndash;8.
</p><p>
Of course, that was just one fight among many. But it also suggests that
our only options are what Powell calls &ldquo;subversion or
jujitsu&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The biggest form of subversion may be what the Free Software and Open
Source movements have been doing from the beginning: producing, rather
than just consuming. Powerful things happen when the demand side
supplies itself. That's what gave us the GNU tools, Linux, the LAMP
stack and the Net itself. And, what thousands of geeks did with code,
millions of consumers can do with media.
</p><p>
In the next several years, we'll see the supply side of the media market
change radically. The ability to produce top-quality audio has been
around for a while. But video will be the big difference-maker. Will
premium deals between giant carriers and giant content producers even
matter when the biggest source of content for everybody on the Net will
be each other?
</p><p>
New businesses and business models will emerge then. These will need to
be cage-free&mdash;ones that evolve to thrive in the Net's wide-open
natural habitat.
</p><p>
For guidance in that direction, here's Lessig again, from the same
&ldquo;Free
Culture&rdquo; speech:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Build a world of transparent creativity&mdash;that's your job, this weird
exception in the 21st century of an industry devoted to transparent
creativity, the free sharing of knowledge. It was not a choice in
1790; it was nature in 1790. You are rebuilding nature. This is what
you do. You build a common base that other people can build upon....This is your enterprise. Create like it's 1790. That's your way of
being. And you remind the rest of the world of what it was like when
creativity and innovation were a process where people added to
common knowledge. In this battle between a proprietary structure and
a free structure, you show the value of the free.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Two hundred sixteen years later, our job is still putting revolution
to work.
