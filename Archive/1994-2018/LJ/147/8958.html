OpenSSL contains a command-line tool to do nearly everything possible
within the OpenSSL library. Even better, it's probably already installed on your system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c102f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
OpenSSL is a powerful Secure Sockets Layer cryptographic library. Apache
uses it for HTTPS encryption, and OpenSSH uses it for SSH encryption.
But, you don't have to use it as a library. It's also a multipurpose, cross-platform crypto tool.
</p><p>
Here's a little background on OpenSSL. Before OpenSSL, there was ssleay,
an SSL implementation written by Eric A. Young. It was successively
improved and eventually became OpenSSL, similar to how NCSA HTTPd became
the Apache Web server. Today, OpenSSL supports dozens of cryptographic
algorithms and protocols with hundreds of options.
</p><p>
OpenSSL has a lot of features. In addition to the SSL client and server
features, OpenSSL also has:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
US federal government NIST FIPS 140-2 Level 1 validation.
</p></li><li><p>
TLS, the next generation of SSL.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Thirty-six commands.
</p></li><li><p>
Six message digest algorithms.
</p></li><li><p>
Nine cipher algorithms with four block modes (where applicable).
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple crypto protocols.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although OpenSSL is complex, a lot of that complexity can be avoided. The
remainder of this article concentrates on features that are easy to
use, and in only a few lines of shell code.
</p><p>
This article uses the same section titles as in my earlier GnuPG article
(&ldquo;GnuPG Hacks&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, March 2006, page 52) to make it easier
to compare OpenSSL and GnuPG.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c10f50"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
First, let's confirm that OpenSSL is installed and in your
path. Many Linux distributions, even some small distributions, include
OpenSSL. Usually OpenSSL is located in /usr/bin/, like most bundled
packages.
</p><p>
In all of the examples, the shell prompt is set to $.
</p><p>
First, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl version
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Note that there are no leading dashes for the version option.
</p><p>
You should get something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
OpenSSL 0.9.7d 17 Mar 2004
</pre>
</p><p>
The exact version number, date and other details may vary. At the time
of this writing, the current version is OpenSSL 0.9.8a. The examples
we're using should work for most versions of OpenSSL.
</p><p>
If you typed <tt  >openssl</tt> with no command-line option,
you'll get this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
OpenSSL&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
If this happens, simply type <tt  >quit</tt> or press Ctrl-C to exit safely. It's
only the OpenSSL internal command-line prompt. It doesn't have
command-line editing and has no explicit help function. But, it will type a list
of commands if you type a command it doesn't know. It's better to avoid
it for now.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11528"></a>
Binary File Shields</h2></div></div><p>
Binary files typically are sent in e-mail using MIME. However, if your e-mail
software doesn't support MIME, like most command-line e-mail, you're
stuck with uuencode, or you can use OpenSSL's base64 encoding. Base64
is the same encoding used by the much more complicated MIME protocol,
but it's not directly MIME-compatible.
</p><p>
To wrap a file in base64 text encoding, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl base64 &lt; filename.bin &gt; filename.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
To unwrap a base64-encoded file, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl base64 -d &lt; filename.txt &gt; filename.bin

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11790"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Note that OpenSSL doesn't care about the filename extension.
</p><p>
OpenSSL, unlike GnuPG or MIME, also can encode short strings, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "The <i  >Linux Journal</i>" | openssl base64
VGhlIExpbnV4IEpvdXJuYWwK
</pre>
</p><p>
Decoding is similar:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "VGhlIExpbnV4IEpvdXJuYWwK" | openssl base64 -d
The <i  >Linux Journal</i>
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11aa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Note the -d option, which specifies decoding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c11bb0"></a>
Better Checksums</h2></div></div><p>
sum and cksum are the traditional UNIX checksum
programs. They work fine, as long as as you don't need cross-platform
compatibility or security, and you don't mind that occasionally
two completely different files will have the same checksum value.
</p><p>
Although Linux systems often have md5sum installed, the MD5
algorithm suffers from a relatively new vulnerability and shouldn't be
used anymore.
</p><p>
If it's installed, the more secure sha1sum should be
used. Several different programs go by this name, however. Some versions
can hash only one file at a time, some can't handle stdin or have some
other deficiency. If you run into any of these problems or simply want
consistent, known, good cross-platform software, consider OpenSSL.
</p><p>
The OpenSSL hash output format is a bit different from GnuPG, but
numerically identical. OpenSSL format always identifies the algorithm used
and also outputs a lowercase hexadecimal string with no whitespace. Some
find this format easier to use.
</p><p>
Here are some examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl sha1 filename
SHA1(filename)= e83a42b9bc8431a6645099be50b6341a35d3dceb

$ openssl md5 filename
MD5(filename)= 26e9855f8ad6a5906fea121283c729c4
</pre>
</p><p>
As in my previous &ldquo;GnuPG Hacks&rdquo; article, the above examples use a
file that contains the string: &ldquo;The <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;. Note that
there is no period in the string.
</p><p>
If you have a problem replicating these results, here is the ASCII-annotated hexadecimal representation of the file. Note the newline at
the end automatically added by vi:

<pre     class="programlisting">
T  h  e     L  i  n  u  x     J  o  u  r  n  a  l  \n
54 68 65 20 4c 69 6e 75 78 20 4a 6f 75 72 6e 61 6c 0a
</pre>
</p><p>
OpenSSL, unlike GnuPG, doesn't have SHA-512, but OpenSSL does have MD2,
MD4 and MDC2. These are older algorithms that are provided for backward
compatibility. Like MD5, they shouldn't be used anymore.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c08968"></a>
Quick and Clean Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Although not OpenSSL's strength, it also can encrypt files. The
flexibility of OpenSSL makes it a bit more complicated than GnuPG.
</p><p>
OpenSSL has very few defaults, so more options have to be used.
There are also many algorithms from which to choose. Some algorithms, like
DES and RC4-40, are kept only for backward compatibility and shouldn't
be used anymore. Strong algorithms you should use include bf,
which is the Blowfish algorithm, and -aes-128-cbc, which is the
US NIST Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128-bit keys running in
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
</p><p>
Here is an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl enc -aes-128-cbc &lt; filename &gt; filename.aes-128-cbc
enter aes-128-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter aes-128-cbc encryption password:

</pre>
</p><p>
As with GnuPG, OpenSSL asks for a passphrase twice, which will not
echo to the screen.
</p><p>
Decryption is also a bit more complicated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -in filename.aes-128-cbc &gt; filename
enter aes-128-cbc decryption password:
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c08c80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Note the -d in this example, which specifies decryption.
</p><p>
OpenSSL, unlike GnuPG, does not automatically detect the file type
or even what algorithm, key length and mode were used to encrypt a
file. You need to keep track of that yourself. In my example, I've put
that information in the filename extension. OpenSSL won't manage the
files and file extensions for you, you have to specify where you want
the outgoing data written.
</p><p>
If you don't specify the correct algorithm, OpenSSL either may spew
garbage or complain about a bad magic number. Either way, without the
correct options, your data won't decrypt properly. To be fair, this is
simply not something OpenSSL was designed to do, but it does work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c08e38"></a>
Passphrases</h2></div></div><p>
Before we go much further, we should discuss the importance of passphrases.
In most cryptosystems, the passphrase is the secret that keeps the other
secrets. It's usually the weakest point. So, creating strong passphrases is
important, but it's also difficult, unless you have the right tools. Using
OpenSSL, you can create a strong passphrase quickly.
</p><p>
A simple guide to passphrases is that longer is usually better, and eight
characters is not long enough (Table 1). The goal is to make a secret
that you can remember but that someone else won't know, can't guess
or won't eventually stumble upon.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c08f98"></a><p class="title"><b>

Generating a Passphrase</h2></div></div><p>
OpenSSL can create very strong random passphrases like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl rand 15 -base64
wGcwstkb8Er0g6w1+Dm+
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run this example, your output will be different from the example,
because the passphrase is randomly generated.
</p><p>
The first argument of 15 is the number of binary bytes to generate,
and the second argument of -base64 specifies that those binary bytes
should be encoded in base64 characters. For 15 bytes, the output
always will be 20 characters, plus a newline character.
</p><p>
The base64 character set consists only of uppercase and lowercase
letters A&ndash;Z, the numbers 1&ndash;9 and the three
punctuation characters: plus, slash and equals. This is intentionally
a limited character set, but more complexity in the character set is not
necessarily better. Adding only one additional character makes up
for the difference in security. For example, an eight-character fully printable
ASCII password is about a strong as a nine-character base64 password.
</p><p>
Although not as quick as using <tt  >OpenSSL rand</tt>, the Diceware
passphrase generator produces strong and often easy-to-memorize
passphrases. I highly recommend it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1c0a330"></a>
Encrypted Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
Here's something that GnuPG can't do. OpenSSL has a built-in command
for creating encrypted Linux passwords exactly like those made by
/bin/passwd.
</p><p>
Skip this paragraph to avoid pedantic cryptography. Although commonly
called encrypted, Linux passwords are actually hashed using
either MD5 or the old UNIX password hash (based on the DES encryption
algorithm). This allows Linux not to know your password even though it
knows when you provide the correct password. When you set your password,
Linux hashes your password and stores it in /etc/shadow. When you log in,
Linux takes the password you provide and hashes it again, and then compares
that hash to what's stored in /etc/shadow for your account. If they match,
you provided the correct password and can log in. If they don't
match, you don't know your password, and because only the hash was
stored, the computer still doesn't know your password either.
</p><p>
Here's why making your own password hash is useful. Let's say you need
a new password on another computer. Perhaps it's a new account or you
forgot the old password and asked the system administrator to reset it
for you. If you can talk to the sysadmin in person, this works well, but
what if the sysadmin is somewhere else? Perhaps you've never even met
your sysadmin. How do you communicate your new password? E-mail is not
secure at all, and telephones are scarcely better. Postal mail takes days
(and has other security problems). Fax machines, text messaging and
most pagers aren't secure either.
</p><p>
It gets worse. Maybe you don't even trust that sysadmin. Sure, the
sysadmin usually has root, but someone else knowing your password bypasses
even root accountability. Maybe you want to use the same password on
other computers, and you don't trust those sysadmins either.
</p><p>
So, do this instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl passwd -1
Password:
Verifying - Password:
$1$zmUy5lry$aG45DkcaJwM/GNlpBLTDy0
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter your new password twice; it won't echo. If you have multiple
accounts, run the above example multiple times. The output is
the cryptographic hash of your password. The hash is randomly salted
so that every time it's run, the output will be different, even if the
password is the same.
</p><p>
In my example, the password hash is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$1$zmUy5lry$aG45DkcaJwM/GNlpBLTDy0
</pre>
</p><p>
Your password hash probably will be completely different, except for
the initial $1$.
</p><p>
This password hash can now be e-mailed, faxed, text messaged or even
spoken over the phone to a sysadmin to set as your password hash.
</p><p>
After the sysadmin receives your password hash, it can be entered into
/etc/shadow manually or with chpasswd. The latter requires a
temporary new file, call it newpassword, with your loginid and password
hash like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LoginidHere:$1$ywrU2ttf$yjm9OXTIBnoKJLQK2Fw5c/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1f1ddf8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The file can contain multiple lines for other accounts too.
</p><p>
Then, the sysadmin runs this as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">

chpasswd --encrypted &lt; newpassword

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the new password is set. It's a good idea to change your
password once you log in, unless you use a really strong passphrase. This
is because the password hash, once exposed, is subject to off-line brute-force attacks, unless the password is really long.
</p><p>
This method of resetting passwords can be quite secure. For example, using
this technique, someone could take the password hash published above,
create an account, then tell the person the loginid and hostname and that
the password hash above was used. Only the person who originally created
the password hash could know the password, even though the password hash
was published in a magazine.
</p><p>
By the way, the password for that hash is 28 completely random base64
characters long, so it should be extremely difficult to crack. But please,
don't create any accounts with that hash because the password is also
published, it's:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HXzNnCTo8k44k8v7iz4ZkR/QWkM2
</pre>
</p><p>
That password and hash were created like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl rand 21 -base64
HXzNnCTo8k44k8v7iz4ZkR/QWkM2
$ openssl passwd -1 HXzNnCTo8k44k8v7iz4ZkR/QWkM2
</pre>
</p><p>
These examples use the MD5 password hashes now common on Linux systems. If
you need to use the old UNIX password hash, simply leave off the
-1. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl passwd
Password:
Verifying - Password:
xcx7DofWC0LpQ
</pre>
</p><p>
The password for this last password hash example is: <tt  >TheLinux</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b18580.0x1f1e320"></a>
Crypto Benchmarking</h2></div></div><p>
The many algorithms that OpenSSL supports makes it well suited for
cryptographic benchmarking. This is useful for comparing the relative
performance of different cryptographic algorithms and different hardware
architectures using a consistent code base. And, it has a built-in benchmarking command.
</p><p>
The <tt  >openssl speed</tt> command, by default, runs through every
single algorithm in every single supported mode and option, with several
different sizes of data. The different sizes are important because of
algorithm start-up overhead.
</p><p>
A complete <tt  >speed</tt> run takes about six minutes, regardless of
hardware performance, and produces 124 lines of performance data with 29
lines of summary.
</p><p>
However, note that cryptographic algorithm performance is extremely
dependent on the specific implementation. For higher performance, OpenSSL
has x86 assembly code for several algorithms. Other architectures,
such as ia64, SPARC and x86-64, have much less assembly code, and
most others have none. The assembly code is located in these OpenSSL
source code directories: crypto/*/asm. Excerpts of the speed
report for three different systems are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Learning More</h2></div></div><p>
This is only a sample of what OpenSSL offers at the command line.
</p><p>
Some documentation is available at the OpenSSL Web site under the Documents
and Related sections. There are also several mailing lists available
under the Support section.
</p><p>
OpenSSL is written in and for C/C++, but it has been adapted to other
programming languages, including Ruby. In addition, the FIPS 140-2 Level 1
validation in March 2006 makes OpenSSL a new contender in the enterprise
and government cryptography markets.
