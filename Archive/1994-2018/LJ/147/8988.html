Win or lose, we're almost done with our shell scripted
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e2b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we finally wrangled the issue of Aces being worth either one or
11 by recognizing the value of what I call lazy coding&mdash;trying to solve
the specific situation rather than creating an elegant and sophisticated
general solution. I've since talked with
some programmers and found that many don't agree with my philosophy. Indeed,
one chap basically said I was completely wrong, especially if the
code's to be published&mdash;as this column obviously is&mdash;and that I
should always be
putting in maximal effort to present exemplary, elegant solutions
to any problems encountered.
</p><p>
But what if, I countered, that would make a program two times longer? Or
four times longer? He looked at me blankly and asked, &ldquo;Since when does
the length of a program matter when you're trying to solve a problem or
model a particular behavior?&rdquo; It's a fair question, but I have to think
that's where all of our code bloat comes from&mdash;where no programs can be
simple, efficient and streamlined, and everything does everything else,
including word processors that can send e-mail, e-mail programs that can
do rudimentary page layout, text editors that can convert ASCII to HTML,
Web browsers that, well, seem to include just about every feature up to
and including KitchenSink.app.
</p><p>
And, don't get me started on the Emacs versus vi philosophy either, okay?
Let's just say that an editor that can replace your OS kernel might just
be a wee bit over-implemented for the vast majority of users.
</p><p>
The real cost of all this complexity, however, isn't the length of the
code. After all, gigs of disk space are dirt cheap nowadays, and
even RAM seems to be not much more than a decent meal. The cost is in the
complexity itself&mdash;in the fact that large, complex systems are harder to
work with, harder to debug and harder to make bulletproof than simple
systems. You need but look at the challenges Microsoft is facing as it
tries to ship its new Windows OS, Vista, before spring 2010.
</p><p>
So, what does this all have to do with shell script programming? I suggest
that this discussion is pivotal to all programming tasks, actually, and
that if you can't figure out a simple and manageable solution within the
world of shell scripting, it might well be time to move to a more
sophisticated development environment. Early on in this column, I joked
about eventually rewriting the popular game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> as a shell script, but
of course, it's the complexity that would kill us, even if we might well
be able to hammer our square peg into the round hole of shell
scripting.

And So, Back to Vegas</h2></div></div><p>
Let's get back to our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game and see where
we are vis-&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;vis
complexity, length and functionality. My suspicion is that we're going to
be able to wrap up this project by the end of the next column, because it's
really all the mechanics that we can create as a script; the game itself
is always doomed to be a primitive command-line interface, because, well,
it's a shell script. Could we layer an interface with Tk or some other
graphical toolkit? Sure, but then, would you really want the underlying
code base to be a shell script?
</p><p>
Our code is now getting into the category of seriously long shell scripts,
weighing in at 177 lines. That's actually beyond my usual cutoff of 150
lines maximum for a script, so we definitely need to wrap this up before it
gets too much longer anyway.
</p><p>
The missing piece we'll deal with in this column is to test for a dealer
blackjack and player blackjack situation. If you are dealt an Ace and
a ten-point card (a ten or a face card) you have a blackjack. If the
dealer has a blackjack, the game ends and the player loses. If the
player gets a blackjack on the deal, the game ends and the dealer loses
(without being able to get additional cards, because a 21-point hand that
involves more than two cards does not tie a player's blackjack). If you
have the extraordinary situation of both the player and dealer having a
blackjack, it's a &ldquo;push&rdquo; or tie, just as it is in any other situation
where both player and dealer have the same point value in their hands.
</p><p>
The key spot where we need to modify the code to test for blackjacks is
where the hands are dealt, and we might as well deal both hands before
adding the additional test. Here's the hand-dealing code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
player[1]=${newdeck[1]}
player[2]=${newdeck[3]}
nextplayercard=3        # player starts with two cards

dealer[1]=${newdeck[2]}
dealer[2]=${newdeck[4]}
nextdealercard=3        # dealer also has two cards
</pre>
</p><p>
To see whether either hand is a blackjack quickly, we'll use the
handValue function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
handValue ${newdeck[1]} ${newdeck[3]}
</pre>
</p><p>
Recall that because you can't return values in functions, handValue
simply sets the global variable $handvalue to the numeric value of the
hand. This means the test is straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# test for dealer or player blackjack

handValue ${player[1]} ${player[2]}
playerhandvalue=$handvalue
handValue ${dealer[1]} ${dealer[2]}
dealerhandvalue=$handvalue

echo ""

if [ $playerhandvalue -eq 21 -a $dealerhandvalue -eq 21 ] ; then
  echo "Extraordinary! Both the dealer and player were dealt a blackjack!"
  echo "Unfortunately, this means you didn't win: it's a push (or tie)."
  echo ""
  exit 0
fi

if [ $dealerhandvalue -eq 21 ] ; then
  echo "Darn it! Dealer pulled a blackjack out of his hat. You lose."
  echo ""
  exit 0
elif [ $playerhandvalue -eq 21 ] ; then
  echo "NICE! You got a blackjack and won the game. Payout would be 3:2!"
  echo ""
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that I simply create playerhandvalue and dealerhandvalue
for these numeric tests, and then check whether both are 21, the dealer is
21 and the player is 21. That's all there is to it.
</p><p>
To test the new code, simply slip in either or both of the following
lines right before the handValue call above:

<pre     class="programlisting">
player[1]=1 ; player[2]=11
dealer[1]=1 ; dealer[2]=12
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can, um, stack the deck
and create the specific test situations you desire.

Almost Done</h2></div></div><p>
We've run out of space for this column, but all that's left is to
implement the overall play logic. The game as it stands now shuffles
the deck, deals cards for the player and dealer, lets the player
add new cards (&ldquo;hit&rdquo; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span>
parlance) until he or she is satisfied or
exceeds 21 points, and shows the dealer hand. Next column, we'll write the
loop that lets the dealer play out its hand and determine who won the
hand. No doubt we'll sneak in some interface features too, of course,
but one way or the other, next column will be a wrap for this particular
scripting project.
</p><p>
This means I'll be ready to tackle something new! If you have a
particular scripting project you think could be an interesting study,
please drop me an e-mail, and I'll consider it for a future column
series. Otherwise, I've been eyeing the game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span> pretty closely.
