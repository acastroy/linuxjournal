I won't even pretend the Cool Projects issue isn't my favorite of the
year. This year is particularly neat for me, because although I'm on the
editorial staff, before seeing the layout, I wasn't sure what content was
going into it. So my first impressions were very similar to what yours are
about to be. And, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
</p><p>
Ever since I was a kid, my definition of &ldquo;something cool&rdquo; almost always
has included a robot. That includes books, movies and even science projects.
Zach Banks proves this is the Cool Projects issue by showing us how to
interface an iRobot with Linux. The iRobot isn't exactly as advanced
as a Terminator robot from SkyNet, but it's also less likely to kill you.
I think that's a fair trade-off.
</p><p>
Frank Pirz shows us his creation for digitizing old 8mm videotapes. Sure,
there are services out there that will convert the old
reel-to-reel tapes for you, but they're terribly expensive, and you have little
control over the end product. Building a converter yourself solves all those
problems. Yes, it's cool. Yes, it's homemade. And yes, it runs Linux.
With all that new digital footage around, wouldn't it be nice to have an
open-source method to play it on your television? Again, you're in luck.
James Gray interviews Neuros Technology's CEO this month. There's
not a more &ldquo;open&rdquo; company when it comes to video recording and playback, so
you'll want to hear what he has to say.
</p><p>
You'll also need a place to store all that video you digitize, and Bill
Childers shows us an open-source storage appliance solution called
OpenFiler. Many of the devices you can buy already are running Linux of
some sort, so why not build your own with an old PC you have lying around?
Repurposing old hardware to act as a file server is always cool, so be sure
to check it out. And while you're at it, check out what Bill and Kyle are
arguing about this month. Bill thinks AJAX is a great way to interface
people with applications, but Kyle seems to think AJAX is more useful as a
toilet cleaner. You be the judge of who makes the better argument.
</p><p>
Speaking of arguments, if you're like me, you have a hard time
remembering to shut off the lights when you leave a room. In my house,
this causes arguments that rival Bill and Kyle. Thankfully, Daniel
Bartholomew shows us Vera, a home-automation device that can save you time
and money&mdash;with Linux. It might be a gadget I can convince my wife to
buy.
</p><p>
Not cool enough? Wow, tough crowd. Okay, we'll pull out the big guns.
Well, maybe not actual guns, but the Cambridge Autonomous Underwater
Vehicle sort of looks like a torpedo. Andy Pritchard tells us all about it.
And, even bigger than that&mdash;rockets. No, really. Sarah Sharp shows us a
rocket with a USB interface. If you think a USB interface means it's a
tiny rocket, you'll be surprised. Be sure to look for pictures,
because the scale will surprise you.
</p><p>
On the off chance your personality isn't similar to mine, fear
not. This issue is focused on cool projects, but the coolest project of
all is Linux. And, that is the focus every issue. This month, Mick Bauer
continues his security series on Squid. Kyle Rankin shows us that even
<tt  >rm
-rf</tt> can't keep a sysadmin down, and Reuven Lerner demonstrates running
Rails applications with Phusion Passenger. Add Dave Taylor's article on
special variables and Doc Searls' EOF article on
Privacy, and this issue will keep you in Linux bliss all month. Unless
SkyNet really does send killer robots from the future, in which case, this
issue might actually save your life.
