RotateRight's Zoom</h2></div></div><p>
The good folks at RotateRight informed us that their system-wide
performance profiler for Linux, Zoom, has been updated to version 1.3.
Zoom profiles are system-wide and precise down to the instruction level,
and they capture backtraces. Zoom also analyzes and annotates code with
specific tuning advice for most compilers and processors. The latest
product update features a number of enhancements to help increase
programmer productivity and optimize Linux application performance, both
of which reduce costs by making software faster and more energy-efficient.
These include support for Intel Atom and Core i7 processors, ability
to show kernel source and assembly, support for external debug info
files, calculation of symbol ranges when missing symbol information and
several others. Zoom is available for Linux x86-64, i386 and PowerPC 64.

Sans Digital's AccuSTOR AS212X2</h2></div></div><p>
Sans Digital's new AccuSTOR AS212X2 Series is a 2U 12-bay SAS enclosure
for mid-range and high-capacity storage environments. Sans Digital
headlines the product as the first JBOD rackmount to overcome the lack
of monitoring ability when utilizing a RAID controller card. A built-in
selectable switch allows hardware monitoring via various popular brands
of RAID controller interfaces. This new monitoring feature, says Sans
Digital, &ldquo;further simplifies the management process by allowing system
administrators to access hard drive status, as well as power supply and
cooling fan information&rdquo;. Data is protected by RAID protection provided
by LSI, 3ware, Intel, Dell, ATTO, Areca or Adaptec SAS RAID controllers.
The AS212X2 uses the latest SAS expander technology to connect up to
12 high-performance SAS drives or high-capacity SATA drives to the host
computer using a single SAS cable, enabling a system bandwidth of up to
1,200MB/s.

Marvell Semiconductor's SheevaPlug</h2></div></div><p>
The SheevaPlug is one of the diminutive yet powerful devices in Marvell
Semiconductor's &ldquo;Plug Top Computing&rdquo; initiative, a computing approach
that features embedded, Linux-powered computers that plug in to electrical

left on all the time and &ldquo;are capable of running network-based services
that normally require a dedicated [PC]&rdquo;. These services include Web,
e-mail and VPN servers hosted in homes and small offices. SheevaPlug
features a 1.2GHz Marvell Sheeva CPU and 512MB each of Flash and DDR2
memory. Network connectivity is via Gigabit Ethernet; peripherals can
be connected using USB 2.0. The SheevaPlug development kit contains
the SheevaPlug and software tools needed to develop applications for
the platform.

The Mono Project's Moonlight</h2></div></div><p>
Ancient are the days of a multimedia-handicapped Linux, thanks in part to
applications like Moonlight, a newly 1.0 open-source project that gives
Linux users access to Microsoft Silverlight content for the first time.
It also plays Windows Media content. Moonlight is developed by the Mono
Project, sponsored by Novell, and it works in tandem with the Banshee media
player. Moonlight is part of a technical collaboration between Microsoft
and Novell that offers a set of media codecs that bring optimized and
licensed decoders for the Microsoft-based media formats. Developers
also can write Rich Internet Applications for multiple platforms.
Moonlight is available for all major Linux distros.
