I tripped across Shawn Powers' video titled &ldquo;An Open Video to
HP&rdquo; on YouTube 
[<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/open-letter-hp" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/video/open-letter-hp</a>], and
it occurred to me that the market share that Windows enjoys is actually very
misleading in that there are a lot of Linux people who buy machines that
come pre-installed with Windows and then toss out the Windows. That's what
I did, and I know of others. So my point is (and I'm sure you probably
thought of this already) that the Windows market share may not be as big
as companies like HP are being led to believe. It would be nice if
companies could be forced by law to sell machines without a pre-installed
OS anywhere they market their machines.

I think you have a very good point. Sadly, I think OEM manufacturers
get a significant kickback from the &ldquo;crapware&rdquo; they pre-install with
Windows. My guess is that offsets the price of Windows for the OEM
manufacturers, so they have little motivation to sell them without 
Windows. You're absolutely correct though; I have many computers with
Windows license stickers on them that are running Linux. The numbers are
probably skewed greatly regarding the installed base.&mdash;Ed.

In his December 2008 article &ldquo;Samba Security, Part II&rdquo;, Mick Bauer wrestles
uneasily with sudo: &ldquo;Note the sudo, necessary for Ubuntu. On other
distributions, <tt  >su</tt> to root...and omit the sudo that [begins each
line]....&rdquo; I've seen similar laments in other forums.
</p><p>
On systems like Ubuntu and Mac OS X, to avoid typing exhaustion and
disruption
to normal trains of thought, I &ldquo;su to root&rdquo; with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo su
</pre>
</p><p>
I haven't read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for a while. Perhaps I'm missing something.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Henry Grebler  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span>
If my writing style was awkward in this case, I apologize, but in fact, I'm
quite comfortable with Ubuntu's requiring <tt  >sudo</tt> for privileged commands.
Habitually using root shells (including, I'm afraid, via <tt  >sudo
su</tt>) is a
good way to make mistakes with an avoidably severe impact.
</p><p>
The inconvenience of having to precede individual commands with
<tt  >sudo</tt> is
significantly offset by the fact that if you issue several in a row within
a short period of time, you'll be prompted for your password only after the
first command in the sequence.
</p><p>
So again, I'd be the last to &ldquo;lament&rdquo; about this. On the contrary, I think
the Ubuntu team has made a very sensible design choice with its sudo
policy!

When is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> going to change its name to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Journal</em></span>? For
about two years now, I've seen a gradual migration from covering Linux in
general to covering Ubuntu specifically. It's all well and good that most,
if not all, of your writers use Ubuntu, but the rest of the community uses
different distributions. I, for one, use OpenSUSE and have for well over
five years. In fact, according to distrowatch.org, the second largest
distribution in terms of &ldquo;registered users&rdquo; is OpenSUSE, and yet most of
the mention I've been able to find regarding it feels like an
afterthought.
</p><p>
I have no interest in switching to Ubuntu, Debian or any such distro. Why
then do I have to feel like a secondary target in any article I read
within <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>? Worse yet, there are sidebars
that seem to
ignore completely the fact that other distros exist (see Mick Bauer's
sidebar about regenerating the smb.conf file in Ubuntu/Debian in the
December
2008 issue).
</p><p>
Perhaps it is time to find another source of Linux information&mdash;one
that pertains to Linux in general and not what one magazine thinks I should
be using.

Mathew Snyder  <br><br>

I understand your frustration. One of the difficulties with producing
content that is beneficial to most people is that the procedures vary
so widely from distribution to distribution. I'm guilty of using Ubuntu
as an example often too. Sure, part of it is because it's the most
popular distribution right now, but for me, it's also the one with which I'm most
familiar.
</p><p>
We have had discussions internally about trying to make our content as
distro-neutral as possible, so perhaps you'll see at least a slight shift
in future issues. At least one of our staff members is a die-hard OpenSUSE
fan, so you're certainly not alone. Thanks for the comment; it's
important to be reminded of such things.&mdash;Ed.

I could not believe my eyes when I received my [February 2009] copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> and
caught sight of the cover. I wanted to ask it, &ldquo;Is that a penguin in your
pocket or are you really happy to see me?&rdquo; Going for a different
demographic? I am not insulted, but I almost choked on my coffee I was
laughing so hard!

</p><a name="N0x299a580.0x2a93850"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x299a580.0x2a93850"></a>Compression Tips</h4><p>
As usual, Mick Bauer's article, &ldquo;Secured Remote Desktop/Application
Sessions&rdquo; in the September 2008 issue was overall excellent. If only I could have read
it about three years ago, it would've saved me a lot of time researching
all this stuff myself.
</p><p>
I noticed only one important detail that wasn't addressed. When using
a graphical environment provided by a distant Linux or UNIX box, one
frequently has performance issues, as the X window protocol isn't very
compact. RFB is a lot better, but there's still a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of data to
transfer, and it's not compressed.
</p><p>
Of course, because it's all not compressed, there's a fairly simple
solution: tell the ssh process we're tunneling through to compress the
data stream, by giving it a -C command-line argument. This may not be
needed when remotely administering your home Linux box from your laptop,
hard-wired to your home gigabit Ethernet or even when using your 802.11n
wireless network. When you're in the US and your server is in
Australia (yes, I've done this), or even if you're just managing a server
on the opposite coast of the US, the cost of compressing and
uncompressing your data packets is going to be a lot less than the cost
of getting the uncompressed data across that pipe.
</p><p>
For the advanced user, one can modify the gzip compression level using
the GZIP environment variable. In my experience, -9 works best on
very fast machines and intercontinental packets (when I was managing
that GUI-only application in Australia, the difference between -8 and
-9 actually was noticeable). On the other hand, unless you have a
really slow link, when talking to the data center in the same building
you're in, you will probably get the best speed from -1, if compression is
even a net win.
</p><p>
Thanks also for your recent articles on Samba security [see Mick's Paranoid
Penguin column in the November 2008, December 2008, January 2009 and
February 2009 issues for the Samba articles]. About four
months ago, my wife's boss gave her a Windows box for home use. As a
result, I had a sudden interest in offering some Windows services from
my home Linux server, and your series was very timely.

<span   class="bold"><b>Mick replies:</b></span>
Thanks so much for your kind words and your important compression tips!
You're right, I completely overlooked the possibility of needing
compression, which is so easily achieved with SSH and GZIP.

In the article, &ldquo;When Disaster Strikes: Hard Drive Crashes&rdquo;
[March 2009],
Kyle Rankin advises as
last resort when fsck can't get your files back to use strings to find your
text data. Before doing that, I would suggest you try the great photorec tool
(<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec" target="_self">www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec</a>). It originally was written to get
photos back from dead Flash cards by looking for JPEG headers, but it now can
identify hundreds of different file types on various filesystems.

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Thanks for the

Regarding the &ldquo;Slice and Dice PDF&rdquo; Tech Tip in the February 2009 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> [page 40],
I would like to point out that PDF slicing and more can be done using
pdftk, without converting to PS and back to PDF. To do the same operation
as
the example in the tech tip, you need to issue the command: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
pdftk afile.pdf cat 11-14 output file-p11-14.pdf
</pre>
</p><p>
I think this is a little easier.

I've been an <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> reader on and off since 1996. I've had my current
subscription for the past few years now, and I'm noticing with dismay the
steady decline in technical articles on Linux internals. My favourite
column used to be Kernel Korner. My current favourite is, perhaps
unsurprisingly, the woefully short &ldquo;diff -u&rdquo;. As tracking Linux core
development is becoming more of a full-time job, those of us who can't
afford the requisite time investment have to rely ever more on sources like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> to avoid reaching the point where our systems are big black boxes to
which we sacrifice the occasional goat in the hope that it'll appease the
binary powers that be. For the sake of all those goats, would you consider
carrying more articles akin to the LWN's &ldquo;Kernel Development&rdquo; section
(current my only reliable source of good technical Linux news)? 
It's not that I don't think browser comparisons, reviews of the latest
desktops' new features and so on are a waste of ink, just that the information
is more available elsewhere on-line for those who seek it, whereas with core
Linux topics, not so much. I'm asking for a more balanced magazine, equally
suited to the new multimedia-savvy, Web 2.0-type users who don't know (or
care) what a bootloader is, as it is to the vim + gcc + xterm users who
don't know (or care) how to access Twitter's newest features using the foo
API. I realise this is generally easier said than done.

Thanks, and much respect for your dedication to the cause for all these
years!

Thanks for your letter. It's a constant challenge to balance between
articles
that appeal to our super-techie crowd, and those that benefit the more
desktop-oriented users. Because Linux is really beginning to show itself in less
niche 
environments (Netbooks, mobile devices and so on), we do need to make sure those
folks
feel <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is for them too. That said, we'll
make sure our hard-core
geeks don't get left behind. You'll probably see some variance between
issues
depending on the focus for that month, but we'll keep trying to balance our
content
so it appeals to our entire readership. Be sure to check out our upcoming
Kernel Capers issue (August 2009).&mdash;Ed.

Regarding Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Counting Words and Letters&rdquo; article
in the March 2009 issue:
there are some options to tr that can be used to simplify Dave's script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cat ^txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 
 &#8618;'[:alpha:]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre>
</p><p>
tr accepts the <tt  >'\n'</tt> argument. Also, the complement and squeeze options
replace two calls to tr and one to grep.
Plus, note that this eliminates counting spaces, which erroneously shows up
as the second most-popular word in Dave's script.
