Jim Dennis, &ldquo;The Answer Guy&rdquo; columnist for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span>, recently interviewed Sameer Parekh for
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Sameer Parekh is the founder of
C2Net Software Inc., http://www.c2.net/, the company that imports
the Stronghold web server. Mr. Parekh has been active on the
Internet since 1990, especially in areas related to privacy,
electronic civil liberties, security and cryptography. Stronghold
has added fully licensed commercial SSL support and other features
to the popular Apache web server. Excerpts of Jim's interview are
printed here; the full interview will be in the August 1 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, http://www.ssc.com/lg/.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> What can you tell me
about C2Net as an organization? I know it used to be Community
Connexions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Yes, we started out
as an Internet provider and a privacy provider&mdash;protecting people's
privacy on the Net. People could get anonymous accounts and set up
anonymous web pages. We were strong supporters of the re-mailer
network; we set up the means by which people can browse the net
anonymously through our proxy. That business was going reasonably
well. I was running it pretty much as a hobby in my spare time,
while still a student at Berkeley. Then, I left school to start
contracting at SGI down in the South Bay (the southern end of the
San Francisco Bay area&mdash;near &ldquo;silicon valley&rdquo;.</p><p>At the end of last year we came out with Stronghold, though
it wasn't called that at first. It was called &ldquo;Apache-SSL U.S.&rdquo;
and started going really well. It became clear that we'd do a lot
better selling cryptography products rather than privacy services.
So, we moved our focus away from privacy services and changed our
name to c2.net to reflect that change in focus and to concentrate
primarily on deploying strong cryptography worldwide. As of a few
months back, we officially had the name changed to C2Net Software
Inc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> And you moved your
customers over to Dave Sharnoff's idiom.com?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> We moved our dial-up
customers over to idiom some time ago&mdash;around April, 1996. We were
still supporting the privacy services until late last year, when we
moved all our web hosting and anonymous account holders to
Cyberpass, a company in San Diego. Cyberpass is run by a cypherpunk
(a mailing list for the discussiong of the politics, technologies
and social ramifications of cryptography and privacy issues) who is
very active in privacy and in the re-mailer network.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> You just mentioned the
&ldquo;cypherpunks&rdquo;&mdash;you and I met at one of their meetings on the
Stanford University campus in Palo Alto. Do you find most of your
employees from this group?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> I find most of my
employees from that group. The others I find from people I know
from school, from other personal contacts and from existing
employee referrals. Of the eleven employees I have, I met about
half through cypherpunks.</p><p>I think a lot of my stand on privacy is related to my
involvement with the cypherpunks and to my involvement in the
controversy surrounding the clipper chip when it was first
proposed.</p><p>We're the only company willing to deal with the fact that
what the US government is trying to do with their export
restrictions goes beyond just impeding or restricting export&mdash;it is
creating a chilling effect so that companies inside the US would
cripple their cryptography even for their domestic products. All of
our development happens overseas so that we can do cryptography
worldwide, and so that the international versions of our products
will not have to be crippled to 40-bit keys that can be broken in
three and a half hours.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> So your approach is
similar to the one John Gilmore and Hugh Daniels are using with the
Free S/WAN project&mdash;keeping the developers at the other end, while
you're providing the quality assurance on this side.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Well, actually,
we're providing mostly the marketing and the sales. We do a little
bit of QA, but that's too close to the export issue. We also do the
documentation&mdash;that's all written in the U.S. Also, all the
protocols and the standardization efforts take place in the U.S.
Stronghold conforms to protocols developed and published by
Netscape, the W3 consortium and the IETF&mdash;among others.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Now, there's something
I'm curious about. You've combined Apache and SSLeay, Eric A.
Young's SSL (secure sockets layer) implementation, and integrated
them into Stronghold. Then, you got a license from RSA so that you
could include their public key libraries. How did you approach the
Apache organization with the idea for a commercial version of their
free package?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Well, Apache is free
under the Berkeley-style license, as opposed to the GPL, which
means that I didn't have to have any connection to the Apache
group. Apache's license allows you, so long as you insert the
appropriate copyright notices, to start selling an Apache-based
product without other delays.</p><p>But that would be kind of rude, I think. I'd been involved in
the group before having any intention of changing the focus of my
business. I saw a need for an SSL version of Apache that could be
available within the U.S., so I started working on it and found
SSLeay and Ben Laurie's Apache-SSL patches, which he'd done in the
UK. I integrated these for limited distribution within the
U.S.</p><p>I already knew many of the Bay Area members socially. I
became a contributor to the Apache group&mdash;although not as big as
the people who do large chunks of the code&mdash;I do testing and help
with the documentation. A full-time tech writer employed at C2Net
does documentation which she contributes back to the Apache
group.</p><p>Our product is doing well, so our connection to the Apache
group has been mutually beneficial. Any bug reports we get from our
customers go back to them; any bugs we find, we fix and donate
back. A large number of the features we've added, we've also
donated back. Naturally, we haven't donated
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of our added features, since we need to
maintain some proprietary value so that we can make some money, as
well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> What do you think about
the GPL versus Berkeley issue? I know this is an ongoing bone of
contention between the FreeBSD and Linux camps.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> I'm generally in
favor of Berkeley over GPL because I think free software is best
done in a variety of different contexts. In particular, with the
crypto environment, it's impossible to do completely free software
inside the U.S. if it involves any public key techniques, because
of the patents. RSA holds a suite of patents which cover almost all
known forms of public key encryption&mdash;patents are quite different
from copyrights in that a re-implementation of the same algorithm
is still covered.</p><p>I think the fewer the restrictions we place on our software,
the more people will use it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> How many international
programmers do you have and where are they located?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> We have two, and we
don't say where they are. We don't want the U.S. government to know
which country they're in, or they might pressure those countries to
add export restrictions to their laws.</p><p>The NSA (National Security Agency) has appointed a person,
David Aaron, whose sole job is to convince other countries to adopt
restrictions similar to ours&mdash;so that our strategy won't continue
to work. Obviously, if all other countries had similar export
restrictions, doing development in any given one would allow sales
only in that locale. That would be pointless in a global economy.
We want to ensure that the country where we are doing our
development will not be targeted.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Have you or any other
company had any official contact with the NSA?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> I haven't, but I've
heard a lot of rumors from companies who've had visits from them
and were told, &ldquo;What you're doing is wrong; you should stop it or
it will do bad things to the rest of your business.&rdquo; NSA can't do
that to me because I have no other business. We do cryptography,
and we're at odds with export restrictions on intellectual
property.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Would you see that as
your edge against Microsoft, Netscape and Sun&mdash;that they would have
other aspects of their business that might get severely hampered by
the fight against cryptography export restrictions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Well, it's not worth
it to them. It doesn't make good business sense for them. At the
same time, it is a business necessity for us.</p><p>Any company who doesn't want to fight this battle can let us
have that chore. They (and their offshore distribution agents) can
license our software, and they won't have to do any development.
They won't have to put their business at risk over questions of
cryptography technologies.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> How many platforms have
you ported Stronghold to?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Stronghold supports
almost 20 different forms of Unix, including Linux. It supports
both the ELF and the a.out libraries. It works with versions 1.2
and 2.0, although we recommend using the latest stable
kernel.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Which implementation do
you think is your biggest volume seller? They're all priced the
same, right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Yes, they're all
priced the same. Linux is our number one seller&mdash;next to it, we
have Solaris and Irix. I haven't actually done the numbers because
we don't sell on a &ldquo;per-platform basis&rdquo;. We sell a Stronghold
license, and the buyer can use it on whatever platform he
wishes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Now you have separate
numbers for evaluation copies acquired and for copies licensed.
About how many evaluation copies are being downloaded every
month?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> On the order of 20
to 30 a day, which would come to about a couple hundred per week,
or about 1,000 per month.</p><p>Netcraft shows that we have an installed base of about 20,000
on the public Internet, but that includes the virtual hosts, so
it's not 20,000 actual hosts&mdash;it's the number of domains served by
a Stronghold server. It's sort of a misleading number because
they're checking only the non-SSL sites, and a lot of people run
Apache on their unencrypted server and Stronghold on the encrypted
server. Many run Stronghold on both, as well.</p><p>Netcraft did a different survey of SSL servers where we came
in second. That is, for servers in general, we came out second
among commercial Unix servers and fourth in commercial
overall.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> The Netcraft surveys
you've been referring to, is there a link to them somewhere on your
web pages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Well, it's at
www.netcraft.com. I think the surveys are on our site as well. I'm
proud of our Netcraft ratings, so we mention them
prominently.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> What other products are
you working on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> We have our &ldquo;Safe
Passage&rdquo; web proxy. This does full-strength SSL for web browsers
worldwide. It's currently in beta and is available at our U.K.
site. It provides a locally-hosted proxy to provide full-strength
cryptographic capabilities to the international versions of
Netscape and Microsoft browsers. As you know, these are limited to
40-bit crypto when sold outside the U.S.&mdash;denying them access to
sites requiring the stronger keys domestically available.</p><p>Basically, &ldquo;Safe Passage&rdquo; allows a user's browser to talk
40 bit to the proxy on his system which, in turn, talks to hosts
out on the Web. Currently, it runs only under Windows.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> What do you think of
the Free S/WAN project?</p><p>S/WAN is a &ldquo;secure wide-area networking&rdquo; protocol from
RSA&mdash;Free S/WAN is a work in progress which is being imported by
another group of cypherpunks and John Gilmore of the EFF.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> I think it's a good
thing. We need to provide IP level encryption in addition to the
applications-specific security provided by programs like Stronghold
or PGP. With regard to our product line, we haven't evaluated how
that might fit into our strategy, so I don't have any comment from
a business perspective.</p><p>However, from a more personal point of view, I think
producing a freely available implementation of IP level encryption
is a great thing. We want this deployed so that all of the Internet
traffic is encrypted and, thus, authenticated.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Getting back to
Stronghold as a &ldquo;commercially supported Apache Server&rdquo; and
leaving aside its support for SSL and commerce... are there any
companies offering just that&mdash;just a commercially packaged
Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> There are companies
that offer Apache support services&mdash;but there aren't any selling a
supported package&mdash;where you'd get a shrink-wrapped box, with
binaries and pre-printed documentation, so these companies just
offer the service. We offer a product&mdash;which includes e-mail
support, of course.</p><p>Cygnus was doing some Apache support as well, but I believe
they may have dropped that. Then there was a company in South
Africa, Thawte, which had a product called Sioux. We ended up
buying that one out and integrating its features with
Stronghold's.</p><p>Sioux was released a few months after we had produced
&ldquo;Apache SSL U.S.&rdquo; We started talking to Thawte&mdash;and decided to
buy Sioux from them to eliminate any conflict of interest for some
other business we wanted to do with them. You see, Thawte's primary
business is as a CA (certification authority). It was an amicable
arrangement, since Sioux wasn't the kind of software business they
wanted to get into. We are now bundling Thawte certificates in the
Stronghold package for only $50 US more&mdash;which is about half the
regular price of a Thawte.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> I've been reading in
the Apache's modules lists about phps; what are they?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> php originally stood
for &ldquo;Personal Home Page&rdquo;&mdash;but it doesn't mean that any more, so
it's just php and doesn't stand for anything.</p><p>A php is a specific module that does dynamic content&mdash;a
phrase I like to use for things like server side includes, extended
ssi, php, e-perl, etc. They are all providing dynamic
content&mdash;where the page is parsed by the server and the data which
are sent to the client are based on the scripting inside the
original document.</p><p>We like php because it's easy to use, it's very robust and it
offers connectivity to almost every database out there. Well, I
shouldn't say that&mdash;there are a lot of databases &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. It
can connect to Postgres '95, mSQL, Solid, Sybase, ODBC, etc.</p><p>It's a way to embed scripting inside your HTML. For example,
you can have conditional sections that include blocks of HTML based
on the results of certain pieces of code. You can have an HTML page
that does a database query, formats and sends information out of
the database. php offers significant speed advantages over CGI
since it's loaded directly into the web server. You save the load
of forking off a Perl process, which you must do when using
CGI.</p><p>Stronghold 2.0 bundles with the php module&mdash;2.0 is in beta
now. We've been using php quite a bit in-house for our database
connectivity and our external web site.</p><p>We also support the server side includes&mdash;which were in the
early CERN server. Stronghold is based on Apache, which also
includes the &ldquo;extended SSI&rdquo;. XSSI adds things like
conditionals.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Do you think tools such
as these are better than CGI?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Yes, it's a lot
easier to build applications&mdash;particularly where it's not a
complicated application&mdash;where you just want to include a little
scripting directly in your HTML. If you use a CGI script, the
script has to output all of the HTML. It's just as transparent to
the browser&mdash;but it's a lot faster, and it's a lot easier for the
web administrator to maintain.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Currently, the whole
SSL view of the world, brought to us by the Netscape Commerce
Server, is all about the server authenticating itself to the
client&mdash;about web sites saying &ldquo;You've reached me&mdash;and not some
imposter and there's no <span   class="emphasis"><em>man-in-the-middle</em></span> and
we can exchange information privately&rdquo;. This approach doesn't seem
to offer anything other than manually typed passwords. Maybe we
need some sort of client authentication certificates for
SSL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Actually, that's
already in there. Stronghold already supports client
authentication. The SSL protocol added that in version 2. Netscape
supports client certificate authentication starting with Navigator
version 3, which was built around the same time as SSL version
3.</p><p>Stronghold was the first widely-used commercial server to
support SSL client authentication. Now that we have the support in
the browser and our server, it's only a question of user acceptance
and getting sites to start using it.</p><p>The SSL client authentication is an excellent technology.
We're using it extensively here at C2Net. Because we have people
from all over the world, we can't have this big private WAN, and we
can't set up a VPN6 using something like Free S/WAN&mdash;it isn't ready
yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> Do you see C2Net coming
out with, maybe, an ssltelnet and sslftp to compete with
ssh?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> Well, we can't talk
about all the details of all our product ideas. Actually, ssltelnet
and sslftp already exist&mdash;no one's supporting them, and no one's
using them yet.</p><p>I think for encrypting secure shell logins and file
transfers, ssh is the best product out there. Although it's a
different authentication protocol, unlike the SSL between my
browser and my web server&mdash;it is RSA-based, and I can use my copy
of ssh through my Ricochet and log in to my servers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim:</b></span> What else can you think
of that just <span   class="bold"><b>has</b></span> to be
said?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sameer:</b></span> The key thing that
we at C2Net are focusing on is the worldwide deployment of
cryptography. I think it's vital that we deploy strong crypto
worldwide in the very near future.</p><p>The U.S. government has made it clear that their intent is to
make the personal use of strong cryptography completely illegal.
Deployment has to happen before they do that. If these crypto
products aren't ubiquitous before then, we'll have a much harder
time protecting our privacy.</p><p>I see cryptography being used for much more interesting
things than just protecting credit cards. While it's prudent to
encrypt your credit card number before sending it over the Net,
it's not an interesting application of strong cryptography.</p><p>We want to build an infrastructure so that restrictions on
personal use of privacy technology will have major business
implications ... so that privacy itself cannot be made
illegal.</p></div></div>
