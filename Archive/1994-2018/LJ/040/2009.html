    We learn to write an application with XForms by simulating a
    game
    with 2 players and 2 actions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x22864a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we began this series on XForms
by explaining how to install the forms library and include file. We
also took a stab at programming with XForms by writing a couple of
simple programs. In this month's article, we're going to write a
fully fledged application. We'll start with an explanation of the
project, and then see how to implement it with XForms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x22865b0"></a>The Project: A Game Theory Simulator</h2></div></div><p>Our task is to implement a game theory simulator. If you
don't happen to have a doctorate in mathematics, you might want to
have a look at <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Primer on Game Theory</em></span> which
appears on page 52 of this magazine. We're attacking a non-trivial
programming task in order to get a handle on how to do
&ldquo;real-world&rdquo; programming with XForms. It's not important that you
understand every nuance of game theory, since our main goal is to
figure out XForms.</p><p>In a formal game, there are two main entities we have to
consider: players and payoffs. So our simulator should allow us to
set relevant values for these elements. Players, for example, are
defined by actions and strategies. Similarly, payoffs are just a
set of values that players receive when they play the game. As a
great simplifier, we'll assume there are only two types of players
and only two possible actions. This reduces the dimensionality of
our programming problem. A good exercise for readers would be to
try and relax the two strategy limitation, but make sure you
understand the initial program fairly well before trying to modify
it.</p><p>Since we're creating a graphical application, we'll want a
point-and-click interface for setting up our players. The method
adopted is to think of players as having a finite number of states.
In every state, there is an action to be taken. Since we've limited
ourselves to just two possible actions, let's call these A and B.
Our simulator will be used for repeated games, so we want to be
able to design players who can change their actions. That is, move
to another state which tells them to play a different action. There
are only two types of players, Column Players and Row Players, and
two actions, so the choice of which action to play can be affected
only by what the other player did.</p><p>Let's say you want to design a player who always plays action
A. That's simple; just set the action in each state to A. A more
complicated example would be to design a player who plays A if the
other player chose A last period, but B if the other player chose
B. This is easier to see with a diagram:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2009f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Diagram of Player States
</p></div></div><p>Here we see that the transitions from state to state can be
made contingent on the behavior of other players. So to implement
an interface for designing players, we have to be able to specify
the action in each state and the transitions to perform, i.e.,
which state to jump to, given the behavior of the other player. We
cannot make one player's choices contingent on what the other
player does in the current period. This would violate one of the
tenets of standard game theory: simultaneous choice of action. Here
we show only two states, but we'll allow for more complicated
player strategies in the actual program.</p><p>We'll also want several players of each type to exist and to
be randomly matched against players of the other type. This sounds
more difficult than it is, since we still have to design only two
types of players. The population of Row Players, for example,
should differ only in what state they are currently in, not in the
overall design of their strategy.</p><p>Like player design, we'll want an easy way for the user to
set and edit payoffs. This is a little simpler, since we just need
a graphical representation of the payoff table and a method for
letting the user change these values. We'll want both of these
features to appear in their own windows so we can pop them up when
we need them.</p><p>Once the user has specified player strategies and payoffs,
we'll also need a way to actually run the simulation. This routine
should match the players, allocate their payoffs, and handle the
transitions from state to state. It should also let us set how long
the game should run, and give us some nice visual feedback on the
progress of play.</p><p>All of this input, interaction and editing may seem very
complicated. It would probably require a fairly cumbersome set of
menus or a command language, if we were going to program this
project on a simple terminal window. But with XForms, we can easily
create windows, input fields and other graphical elements required
to implement our game theory simulator. If this is all a little
hazy, it may be a good idea to play with the running program a
little (see below), and then come back to this section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x2286b88"></a>The xgtsim Program</h2></div></div><p>Let's just plunge right in. We'll get an example up and
running right away, and then use the rest of this article to
explain how it works. The program is called xgtsim and the C source
code can be found in Listing 1.1 Although you're welcome to type it
in, it's also available on the web site for this series (see
http://a42.com/~thor/xforms, <a href="2009l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>). It should compile with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -lX11 -lforms -lm xgtsim.c -o xgtsim
</pre><p>From within the X Window System, you should be able to run
the program by typing <b  >./xgtsim</b> in an xterm
window. If you have problems, you may want to go back and review
last month's article on installing XForms. With all possible
windows open, the running program should look something like Figure
2.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2009f2.large.jpg"><img src="2009f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. xgtsim with Windows Open
</p></div></div>

</p><p>If you want to play around with the program before continuing
with the rest of this article, one useful exercise would be to set
up a prisoner's dilemma. Just use the payoff editor to set values
the same as they appear in the primer, and then try some different
player strategies. In particular, try and figure out what happens
when two Tit-for-Tat strategies come up against each other. Does it
matter what initial strategies they play?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x2287000"></a>The Flow of the Program</h2></div></div><p>Last month, we saw that the basic steps to designing an
XForms program are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Include forms.h to access the XForms
routines</p></li><li><p>Call <b  >fl_initialize()</b> as soon as
possible</p></li><li><p>Set up your graphical interface by creating
forms</p></li><li><p>Assign actions to relevant objects by setting
callbacks</p></li><li><p>Show one or more forms</p></li><li><p>Turn control over to
<b  >fl_do_forms()</b></p></li></ol></div><p>We use this approach in xgtsim. Like all C programs,
execution begins in the <b  >main()</b> routine, which is
at the very end of the source code. First we call
<b  >fl_initialize()</b> to set up XForms, and allow it
to parse command line arguments. Next, we call
<b  >set_defaults()</b> which seeds the random number
generator, and sets some default values for our payoffs and player
design variables: <b  >payoffs[][][]</b>,
<b  >state_actions[][]</b> and
<b  >state_transitions[][][]</b>.</p><p>A call to <b  >create_forms()</b> is then made,
which sets up all of our windows, graphic elements and callbacks.
We'll go into more detail shortly, but let's look at how this works
for the simplest case: quitting the program. Within the
<b  >create_forms()</b> code, we use
<b  >main_window</b> (a variable of type
<b  >FL_FORM</b>) to create a window which will be shown
when the program starts up. This window has four buttons on it,
called Players, Payoffs, Run and Quit. Notice that the Quit button
is set to call the function <b  >quit_xgtsim()</b> with
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fl_set_object_callback(obj, quit_xgtsim, 1);
</pre><p>This means whenever the mouse is clicked on the button
labeled Quit, the quit routine will be called. This function, in
turn, simply calls <b  >fl_finish()</b> and then exits.
</p><p>To return to the flow of the <b  >main()</b>
function, after setting up all of our windows, buttons and so on
with <b  >create_forms()</b>, we then make our
<b  >main_window</b> appear with a call to
<b  >fl_show_form()</b>. Then we turn control over to the
user by calling <b  >fl_do_forms()</b>.</p><p>It's crucial to understand that setting up our forms in
<b  >create_forms()</b> does more than just decide how
graphics should be laid out on the screen. By setting callbacks to
link button pushes and data inputs with specific actions, we've
actually set up the whole flow of the program. When the user pushes
the Payoffs button, it is XForms (via
<b  >fl_do_forms()</b>) which calls the relevant routine
to make the Payoffs window appear, and to handle subsequent
interaction with that window. In fact, if we've set all our
callbacks correctly, execution never returns to
<b  >main()</b>. The <b  >fl_do_forms()</b>
routine returns only if the user activates an object which does not
have a callback associated with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x26801c8"></a>Some Details</h2></div></div><p>Since <b  >create_forms()</b> is so important, lets
look at it in more detail. We use and re-use a generic pointer
called <b  >*obj</b>, which is of type
<b  >FL_OBJECT</b>, to create many of our graphical
elements. This can be a little confusing, but we'll clarify things
as we go.</p><p>The first form created in <b  >create_forms()</b>
is <b  >main_window</b>. This is a global pointer
variable which we declare early in the source code. We tell XForms
it is a window which should be 290 pixels wide and 50 pixels high
with the assignment:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
main_window = fl_bgn_form(FL_NO_BOX, 290, 50);
</pre><p>In the following nine lines of code, we create four buttons
which will be used to pop up windows for user interaction and to
quit the program. Each time we need a new graphical element, we
just use <b  >obj</b>, which saves memory and keeps
things simple. Just remember that whenever we reassign
<b  >obj</b>, all subsequent functions passing
<b  >obj</b> as a value will affect the most recent
assignment. The Players, Payoffs and Run buttons are all linked by
a callback to a routine called <b  >display_forms()</b>,
but they are set to call that routine with the values 1, 2 and 3
respectively. The <b  >display_forms()</b> routine, in
turn, uses these values to decide which window to display. After
creating the Quit button, we tell XForms we're done adding elements
to this form by calling <b  >fl_end_form()</b>.
</p><p>We then go on to create the <b  >player_window</b>,
<b  >payoff_window</b> and <b  >run_window</b>.
These all follow the same general pattern; declare the dimensions
of the window with <b  >fl_bgn_form()</b>, add as many
objects as we want (assigning callbacks as we go), and then finish
with <b  >fl_end_form()</b>. We'll look at the
<b  >run_window</b> in detail, since it's the simplest.
Once you have it figured out, you'll probably want to look over the
other two on your own.</p><p>Since we want visual feedback from the game, we create two
charts in the <b  >run_window</b>. We make these into
line charts by specifying <b  >FL_LINE_CHART</b>, and we
set the dimensions by including 4 integer values. The first two
values represent where the upper left corner of our chart should
appear, with 0,0 being the very top left corner of the form the
object is being created on. The next values describe the width and
height of the object. Finally, we supply a string to give the chart
a label:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
column_chart = fl_add_chart(FL_LINE_CHART, 10, 30,
        190, 90, "Column Players");
</pre><p>You may be wondering why we assign this function call to a
variable called <b  >column_chart</b> instead of using
our generic <b  >obj</b> variable. This is done because
<b  >column_chart</b> is declared as a global variable,
which is accessible to all the routines in xgtsim. In particular,
when the game is actually being run, the
<b  >play_the_game()</b> routine uses this global
variable to add values to the chart we just created&mdash;look for the
function <b  >fl_add_chart_value()</b>.
</p><p>With the label <b  >"Column Players"</b> assigned
to our chart, the default behavior is for it to appear below the
chart. We move it to the top left corner with the call to
<b  >fl_set_object_lalign()</b>. Then we limit the number
of items which can be displayed with
<b  >fl_set_chart_maxnumb()</b>. We then create an almost
identical chart to display information about Row Players.</p><p>In addition to chart feedback, we create two browsers to
display numerical data. This is accomplished with calls to
<b  >fl_add_browser()</b>. Browsers are very useful
objects in XForms, and they can be used in many different ways. Our
implementation here is very simple, but you can learn more about
them in the XForms documentation.</p><p>To allow the user to set the number of iterations the game
should run, we create a counter, and set lots of options. First we
align the label to appear on the left, then set the precision to 0.
This just means we want our counter to hold integer data, since you
can't really perform half an iteration. A standard counter appears
on the screen with two sets of arrows. Whenever they are pushed,
they change the value of the numerical data the counter is holding.
We set bounds on this data with a call to
<b  >fl_set_counter_bounds()</b>, and then make one set
of buttons change the value by 1 and the other set change the value
by 100 by setting the counter step rates. We also set the starting
value in the counter to a default value (stored in
<b  >numb_iterations</b>), and then record a callback.
Whenever the counter object is changed, the routine
<b  >set_iterations()</b> is called which sets the
variable <b  >numb_iterations</b>.</p><p>The run window also contains two buttons, one to start the
game running and one to stop it. Notice that we create these two
buttons in exactly the same place on the form, so that they are on
top of each other. Before finishing, though, we hide the
<b  >stop_button</b> to ensure the
<b  >go_button</b> is visible. When the
<b  >go_button</b> is pushed, it calls
<b  >play_the_game()</b>, which hides the
<b  >go_button</b> and makes the
<b  >stop_button</b> appear. The ability to call
<b  >fl_hide_object()</b> and
<b  >fl_show_object()</b> makes form design in XForms
very flexible, since you can design windows where objects appear
and disappear according to any number of conditions. When an object
is hidden, it is impossible for the user to activate it.</p><p>Once <b  >fl_end_form()</b> is called, we are
nearly done with this window. Immediately afterwards though, we
call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fl_set_form_atclose(run_window, close_forms, 0);
</pre><p>This tells XForms what routine to run when the window manager
sends the close window signal. On most window managers, this signal
is sent when the user clicks on a close icon in the title bar of
the window in question. This is like a callback, but the format is
slightly different. In a normal callback, the declaration is of the
form:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fl_set_object_callback(the_object, the_function,
         an_argument);
</pre>


The function pointed to by <b  >the_function</b> must
accept two arguments, an <b  >FL_OBJECT</b> pointer and a
long, as in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
the_function(FL_OBJECT *obj, long an_argument);
</pre>


This function must return void. When the window close signal is
sent, however, it applies to an entire window/form, not a
particular object on that form. So the first argument to
<b  >fl_set_form_atclose()</b> must be a pointer of type
<b  >FL_FORM</b>, as in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
close_forms(FL_FORM *form, void *an_argument);
</pre>


This function must return an integer, and in particular, it should
return <b  >FL_OK</b> if you want the window to actually
close, and <b  >FL_IGNORE</b> if you want the window to
remain visible.
</p><p>Having looked at <b  >main()</b> and
<b  >create_forms()</b>, the rest of the source code is
fairly easy to follow. The most complicated part is how the
<b  >player_window</b> uses the
<b  >row_or_column</b> variable to edit both types of
players on a single form. The general idea is as follows. The
global variables <b  >state_actions[][]</b> and
<b  >state_transitions[][][]</b> hold all the data on the
current state of both types of players, i.e., Column Players and
Row Players. On the Player window, there are two buttons allowing
the user to choose which type of player they want to edit. Whenever
these are pushed, the Player window must be updated to reflect the
state of these variables. This is done by the
<b  >set_row_or_column()</b> routine, which reads values
from <b  >state_actions[][]</b> and
<b  >state_transitions[][][]</b> into the relevant
objects on the Player window, which are
<b  >action_choices[]</b> and
<b  >transition_inputs[][]</b>.</p><p>With the window updated to reflect the current state of the
relevant set of players, the user can now edit these values. This
is accomplished via the <b  >set_player_values()</b>
function, which is called whenever any of these on-screen objects
are changed. We do not bother trying to figure out which object is
changed, but simply read all values on the Player window into
<b  >state_actions[][]</b> and
<b  >state_transitions[][][]</b>.</p><p>The only remaining subtleties in the program are the use of
the <b  >abort_flag</b> variable and the call to
<b  >fl_check_forms()</b> in the iteration loop of
<b  >play_the_game()</b>. When the Go button is activated
in the Run window, <b  >play_the_game()</b> is called.
One of the first things done in that routine is to set
<b  >abort_flag</b> to zero. Players are matched, payoffs
made and the charts on the Run window are updated. At the bottom of
the iteration loop, we check to see if
<b  >abort_flag</b> has been changed from 0 to 1, and if
it has, we stop the run. You may be confused as to how this flag's
value could have possibly changed within this algorithm.</p><p>The key lies in the call to
<b  >fl_check_forms()</b>. This is a non-blocking routine
that works just like <b  >fl_do_forms()</b>, except that
it exits immediately if no objects were activated. This exacts a
small performance penalty, since the program is effectively
monitoring all its objects while the game is running, but it is
well worth it. Since we set a callback to the Stop button to change
<b  >abort_flag</b> to one (via
<b  >stop_the_game()</b>), clicking on the Stop button
will cause the current game to be aborted.</p><p>This has the added benefit of allowing us to modify all our
data while the simulation is running. For example, we can alter
payoff values and immediately see how this changes the unfolding
game via the visual feedback in the Run window. Similarly, we can
change player strategies on the fly, and watch how this affects
their performance. This probing and runtime editing of parameters
is often very difficult to achieve with standard C running on a
console, but with a few global variables, a little sensible design
and a call to <b  >fl_check_forms()</b>, XForms makes it
almost trivial.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218e580.0x2594eb0"></a>Things to Try</h2></div></div><p>If you've managed to pour over xgtsim and get a good feel for
what's going on, you may want to try altering the source code to
test your understanding. One thing to attempt would be adding an
extra button to the Main window that randomizes all the current
variables. That is, suppose the user has set payoffs and
strategies, but wants to scramble these values. You'll not only
have to add the button and set up the callback, but you'll have to
update any currently displayed windows to reflect these
changes.</p><p>The charts in the Run window currently provide only average
feedback on the two types of players. Try adding more charts or
other elements to display information on the best and worst players
in each category.</p><p>If you're feeling really ambitious, then try altering xgtsim
to allow for more actions and more complicated strategies. This can
get very complicated, since elements like the payoff matrix will
have to grow and shrink depending on how many actions are currently
possible. This can be accomplished by dynamically creating new
objects and forms, something we haven't covered so far.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2009f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Coming Next Month
</p></div></div><p>In playing with xgtsim, you may find a set of strategies and
payoffs that generate interesting results. Currently there's no way
to save this state of the game, because we have no file-based input
and output. We'll be adding that next month, by using XForms
pre-built file requester routine. It's just part of a whole set of
&ldquo;goodies&rdquo; that XForms includes, and we'll be looking at most of
them.</p><p><a href="2009s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p>We'll also spiff up our application with some pixmaps, learn
