will win. As I write this (June 4) there is a verbal agreement
which will give the Linux community clear title to the Linux name.
By the time you read this article there should be a final, written
agreement. For details, select the Hot Linux News button on our web
page at http://www.ssc.com/lj/.
</p><p>For those of you new to the trademark dispute, let me fill in
a little history. In 1996, Linux vendors (including us) started
receiving letters from an attorney representing Mr. William Della
Croce, Jr. requesting royalties for our use of his trademark.
Investigation revealed that he did in fact have a trademark on the
Linux name.</p><p>The Linux vendor community decided to fight the battle
together and, through Linux International, enlisted the services of
G. Gervaise Davis III of Davis &amp; Schroder
(http://www.iplaywers.com). Gerry Davis had already jumped on the
bandwagon because he knew of the Linux effort. His willingness to
take the case because he cared cut our costs substantially.</p><p>Being on the Board of Directors of Linux International, I was
a participant as well as an observer in the battle. While not
everyone agreed with every decision along the way, we all shared
the common goal of getting the Linux trademark clearly into the
hands of the Linux community. Even with our diverse backgrounds we
managed to pull together the necessary information and resources to
present a common front.</p><p>For example, when we found out that Mr. Della Croce's
trademark was filed in 1994, Adam Richter of Yggdrasil Computing
jumped forward with information that he was shipping Linux on CDs
in December, 1992. Also, a few hundred thousand copies of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> published in 1993 certainly had
to help our case.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x283a580.0x29324a8"></a>Where Are We Now?</h2></div></div><p>First and foremost, we have proved that while we may have
competing commercial interests, we can work together for the common
good of the Linux community. I also think that while this action
was costly to Linux vendors it has helped Linux become legitimate
in the eyes of the non-believers. Besides the vendors who are
members of Linux International that supported the effort, we have
received letters from many of our readers asking if there was a
place to send money to help support the effort. This shows the
sense of cooperation that made Linux possible in the first
place.</p><p>Thanks to everyone that helped.</p></div></div>
