    TCP_wrappers provide a simple, elegant and effective means to
    safeguard your network services.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d4d3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>With the Internet growing by leaps and
bounds, the security of computer systems has become a major focus
of large corporations, small businesses and individuals alike.
Hardly a week goes by without a security flaw being discovered in
some network. Many companies are reducing the threat by installing
firewalls between their internal networks and the Internet, but
this option is generally too expensive and cumbersome for single
users running Linux from home or office. TCP_wrappers was written
by Wietse Venema, Eindhoven University of Technology, The
Netherlands. It provides a simple, elegant and effective means to
safeguard your network services from being accessed and possibly
abused by intruders.
</p><p>In this article we will discuss what TCP_wrappers are and how
they work, and how to configure TCP_wrappers to protect your
machine from unauthorized access. We'll also discuss some of the
more advanced features of TCP_wrappers which provide detailed
logging and can even help track attempts to break into your
machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d4d558"></a>What are TCP_wrappers and How Do They
Work?</h2></div></div><p>First, we need to know how a transmission control protocol
(TCP) connection, such as <b  >telnet</b>, is
accomplished. TCP network connections are based on the
&ldquo;client/server&rdquo; model. The <b  >telnet</b> program is a
client that communicates with a server program, or daemon, called
<b  >telnetd</b> or <b  >in.telnetd</b>,
depending on how your machine is set up. Since most Linux
distributions use the name
<b  >in.<i><tt>service</tt></i>d</b> in the
directory /usr/sbin for network daemons, I will use that naming
convention for the remainder of this article.</p><p>All requests for network services first go through the
&ldquo;Internet daemon&rdquo;, <b  >inetd</b>. (As with all things
in life, there are exceptions to this rule, see &ldquo;What TCP_wrappers
Cannot Do&rdquo; below.) This daemon uses two configuration files to
determine how to respond to requests for network connections. The
file /etc/services lists the names of particular services and the
port numbers for those services. The file /etc/inetd.conf lists the
names of the services and the names of the programs or daemons
providing the services. <a href="2180l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
and <a href="2180l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> contain some sample
lines from the /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf files.</p><p>If I sit down at <b  >my.linux-box.com</b> and type
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet your.machine.com
</pre><p>My <b  >telnet</b> client sends a packet of
information containing (among other things) the Internet address of
the source <b  >my.linux-box.com</b>, the Internet
address of the destination <b  >your.machine.com</b> and
the port number for the connection. The port number for
<b  >telnet</b> is 23. <b  >inetd</b> looks up
port 23 in /etc/services and finds the service name
<b  >telnet</b>. It then looks up
<b  >telnet</b> in /etc/inetd.conf and finds that it
needs to run the daemon called <b  >in.telnetd</b>,
listed in the rightmost column of Listing 2.
<b  >inetd</b> runs <b  >in.telnetd</b>
connecting it to port 23 and then goes about the business of
listening for more connections. <b  >in.telnetd</b>
responds to my client, asking for a user name and password and
starting up the telnet session.
</p><p>What if you don't want anyone else to
<b  >telnet</b> into your computer? You can modify the
code for <b  >in.telnetd</b> to look at the source
address of the connection request and to reject any addresses from
outside your local machine or domain. If <b  >telnet</b>
were the only network service this would be easy, but there are
dozens of network services, and it would be a nightmare to modify
every daemon to limit access to your machine.</p><p>At this point TCP_wrappers comes to the rescue. The wrapper
program is a tiny daemon that stands between
<b  >inetd</b> and network daemons such as
<b  >in.telnetd</b> and <b  >in.ftpd</b>. Since
all TCP connections are started up in basically the same fashion, a
single wrapper program can be used to control access to almost all
TCP network services.</p><p>When wrappers are installed, the Internet daemon is
reconfigured to run the wrapper instead of the ordinary network
daemon. The wrapper checks the source address of the connection and
the service it wishes to connect to and decides whether to allow
the connection. If <b  >your.machine.com</b> denies my
request for a <b  >telnet</b> session, all I see is a
dropped connection. If the request is allowed, everything proceeds
normally, and the wrapper never actually interacts with my
<b  >telnet</b> client. In either case, the wrappers
write a note in the system logs to let you know whether I was
successful in connecting to your machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d4e318"></a>Installing TCP_wrappers</h2></div></div><p>Every major Linux distribution comes with TCP_wrappers
installed as part of the networking package. To see if you have
TCP_wrappers installed on your machine, look in the /etc directory
for two files called hosts.allow and hosts.deny. These are the
configuration files used by the TCP_wrapper daemon,
<b  >tcpd</b>. You can also look at your /etc/inetd.conf
file for lines like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd \
        in.telnetd
</pre><p>The <b  >telnet</b> option
<b  >/usr/sbin/tcpd</b> indicates that whenever someone
tries to <b  >telnet</b> to your machine, he will first
connect to the TCP wrapper.
</p><p>TCP_wrappers is probably on your Linux system, so I won't go
into the process of compiling them from scratch in this article.
See the sidebar &ldquo;Where to Get TCP_wrappers&rdquo; for more information
on how to download and install TCP_wrappers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d4e688"></a>Configuring TCP_wrappers</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned above, the TCP_wrappers daemon
<b  >tcpd</b> gets its instructions on whether to allow
or deny access from the two files /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny. <b  >tcpd</b> first scans
/etc/hosts.allow for &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that match the particular service
and computer host name, then searches /etc/hosts.deny. If no match
is found, access is allowed. By default, most distributions ship
TCP_wrappers &ldquo;Completely Open&rdquo;, i.e., the files /etc/hosts.allow
and /etc/hosts.deny are empty, allowing access to all Internet
services on your machine to everyone.</p><p>Before you configure TCP_wrappers, you must decide whether
you want your machine to be &ldquo;Mostly Open&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mostly Closed&rdquo;.
Mostly Open means that most services are available to most other
computers on the Internet; this is useful for blocking access to
just a few troublesome sites or to close off one or two services.
Mostly Closed means that most services are closed off to most other
computers. For personal computers with normal at-home usage, Mostly
Closed is probably the way to go, and it is certainly the more
secure option.</p><p>Let's look at a &ldquo;Mostly Open&rdquo; configuration first. Since we
are allowing most connections, the /etc/hosts.allow file is left
empty. In the <b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b> file, let's put in
a rule to deny access to <b  >telnet</b> and
<b  >rlogin</b> to anyone coming from the machine
<b  >nasty.badguy.net</b> and anyone in the domain
<b  >cracker.org</b>. The requisite line in
/etc/hosts.deny would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
in.telnetd in.rlogind : nasty.badguy.net \
        .cracker.org
</pre><p>Note the leading &ldquo;.&rdquo; in front of
<b  >cracker.org</b>. It signals <b  >tcpd</b>
to deny access to any machine in that Internet domain. Since the
crackers at these sites probably know how to exploit network
services other than <b  >telnet</b> and
<b  >rlogin</b>, you can deny access to all services
using the wild card <b  >ALL</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL : nasty.bad-guy.com .cracker.org
</pre>


Other wild cards that can replace specific host names include
<b  >LOCAL, UNKNOWN, KNOWN</b> and
<b  >PARANOID</b>. <b  >LOCAL</b> matches any
name without a &ldquo;.&rdquo; in it, i.e., host names in your local domain.
<b  >KNOWN</b> and <b  >UNKNOWN</b> refer to
hosts either found or not found in the Domain Name Service,
respectively. <b  >PARANOID</b> matches any host whose
name does not match its Internet address. This option is not often
used, since the wrappers are compiled to reject access to any host
that matches this condition before checking the hosts.allow and
hosts.deny files. To allow access to all network services to
machines in our local domain, we can put the following line in
/etc/hosts.allow:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL : LOCAL
</pre>


Now let's look at a &ldquo;Mostly Closed&rdquo; configuration. Remember that
hosts.allow is checked first, then hosts.deny and, finally, access
is allowed only if no match is found in hosts.deny. To close all
services to all outside machines, we use the following rule in our
hosts.deny file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL : ALL
</pre>


In hosts.allow we list only those specific services we want others
to use. Of course, we still want to access all of our own services
on our own machine. Suppose that we also want to
<b  >telnet</b> into our machine from a shell account
provided by our Internet Service Provider at
<b  >my.isp.net</b>, and we want to allow anyone to
<b  >finger</b> our accounts. The rules to put in the
/etc/hosts.allow file are:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL        : localhost
in.telnetd : my.isp.net
in.fingerd : ALL
</pre>


Now, if we would also like to keep the crackers from
<b  >cracker.org</b> from using <b  >finger</b>
to get information about us, we can modify this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL        : localhost
in.telnetd : my.isp.net
in.fingerd : ALL EXCEPT .cracker.org
</pre>


As you can see, there is quite a bit of flexibility&mdash;but with this
flexibility comes the possibility of confusion and, even worse,
error. If the configuration files for TCP_wrappers are wrong, you
may <span   class="emphasis"><em>think</em></span> you are secure, when in fact you are
not. To check your configuration and test its protection, Wietse
Venema provided two additional programs: <b  >tcpdchk</b>
and <b  >tcpdmatch</b>.
</p><p><b  >tcpdchk</b> checks the configuration files for
any problems. It can tell if you have used wild cards like
<b  >ALL</b> or <b  >LOCAL</b> incorrectly, if
there are nonexistent host names in the access rules, if there are
rules for services controlled by <b  >tcpd</b> in the
/etc/inetd.conf file and much more. For example, the output from
<b  >tcpdchk</b> for the above Mostly Closed
configuration on my machine yielded the following
information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# tcpdchk -v
Using network configuration file: /etc/inetd.conf
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rule /etc/hosts.allow line 6:
daemons:  ALL
clients:  localhost
access:   granted
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rule /etc/hosts.allow line 7:
daemons:  in.telnetd
clients:  my.isp.net
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 7: my.isp.net: \
        host not found
access:   granted
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rule /etc/hosts.allow line 8:
daemons:  in.fingerd
clients:  ALL EXCEPT .cracker.org
access:   granted
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rule /etc/hosts.deny line 10:
daemons:  ALL
clients:  ALL
access:   denied
</pre><p>I used the <b  >-v</b> switch for
<b  >tcpdchk</b> to generate more verbose output. Note
that the program says <b  >my.isp.net</b> was not found,
which is perfectly true, since it is a host name made up for this
example. Also, note that I did not get a similar message for the
equally fictitious <b  >.cracker.org</b>. That is because
it is for an entire domain, and <b  >tcpdchk</b> doesn't
check if a domain is registered, but rather if a particular host
name is in the DNS.
</p><p><b  >tcpdmatch</b> tests your configuration against
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>virtual</em></span> request for an Internet connection.
You provide the name of the daemon and a host name, and it tells
you whether that connection would be allowed or denied. For
example, if I would like to know if the webmaster at
www.linuxjournal.com can finger users on my system, I would enter
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# tcpdmatch in.fingerd webmaster@www.linuxjournal.com
client:   hostname www.ssc.com
client:   address  199.184.169.67
client:   username webmaster
server:   process  in.fingerd
matched:  /etc/hosts.allow line 8
access:   granted
</pre><p>Note that <b  >tcpdmatch</b> found the real host
name of www.linuxjournal.com to be www.ssc.com and reports its
Internet address. The last line tells me that
<b  >finger</b> is indeed allowed from this host.
</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical UNIX and Internet Security, Second
Edition</em></span> by S. Garfinkel &amp; G. Spafford, O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, 1996, the authors state:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Programs like <span   class="emphasis"><em>tcpdchk</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tcpdmatch</em></span> are excellent complements to the
security program <span   class="emphasis"><em>tcpwrapper</em></span>, because they help
you head off security problems before they happen. Wietse Venema is
to be complimented for thinking to write and include them in his
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tcpwrapper</em></span> release; other programmers should
follow his example.</p></blockquote></div><p>I wholeheartedly agree.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d46620"></a>Tracking Usage with Wrappers</h2></div></div><p>TCP_wrappers write a message into your system logs every time
a connection is requested, whether it is granted access or not.
These entries in the logs above are reason enough to have
TCP_wrappers installed on your system. The messages are written
through the standard syslog facility and by default go to the same
place as mail transactions. On my Linux distribution, Caldera
Network Desktop based on Red Hat Linux, the default has been
changed so that the messages are written to the same log file as
other daemons (LOG_DAEMON facility).</p><p>In any event, when someone accesses my machine via
<b  >telnet</b>, a message like this is placed in the
/var/log/messages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Apr  9 17:24:58 ads in.telnetd[15339]: connect from somewhere.else.com
</pre><p>If the connection was refused, the message would read:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Apr  9 17:25:15 ads in.telnetd[15604]: refused connect from someother.place.com
</pre>


If I want to see all the <b  >telnet</b> attempts in my
log, I can simply type the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grep telnetd /var/log/messages
</pre>


TCP_wrappers can give me even more information through the use of
&ldquo;booby traps&rdquo;. TCP_wrappers can be configured to <span   class="emphasis"><em>run
shell commands</em></span> when certain services are requested.
Let's assume I have reason to suspect someone at
<b  >nasty.badguy.com</b> is trying to use the Trivial
FTP program (TFTP) to steal my password file. In my /etc/hosts.deny
file, I can put the following line (this example is straight from
the <b  >hosts_access(5)</b> man page that comes with
TCP_wrappers):
<pre     class="programlisting">
in.tftpd : nasty.bad-guy.com : ( /usr/sbin/safe_finger -l @%h |\
        /bin/mail -s %d-&gt;%h root) &amp;
</pre>


Access to TFTP is denied to all users from
<b  >nasty.badguy.com</b>. In addition, the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
safe_finger @nasty.badguy.com
</pre>


is run, and the results are piped into a mail message sent to the
root user with the subject line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
in.tftpd-&gt;nasty.bad-guy.com
</pre>


<b  >safe_finger</b> is a command provided along with the
TCP_wrappers that strips out any &ldquo;bad&rdquo; characters, like control
sequences and data overruns. Running <b  >safe_finger
@hostname</b> generates a list of everyone currently logged
into that system. The strings <b  >%h</b> and
<b  >%d</b> are called expansions, and
<b  >tcpd</b> replaces them with the corresponding text
for the host name and daemon process, respectively. Other
expansions include <b  >%a</b> for the client Internet
address and <b  >%u</b> for the client user name.
</p><p>Now, this isn't a perfect solution, since our cracker friend
may have disabled his finger service or altered it to give false
information; however, this example does show us the power of the
TCP_wrappers program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x1d46eb8"></a>Using Advanced Options</h2></div></div><p>The access control language in the /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny files is quite simple, yet powerful, but
TCP_wrappers can be compiled to include even more powerful
extensions to the normal access controls. Instead of having the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
service : host
</pre><p>in the configuration files, you can have the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
service : host : option : option ...
</pre>


Where <b  >option</b> can be <b  >allow</b>,
<b  >deny</b> or many other advanced options.
</p><p>To enable the advanced options, compile the wrapper programs
with the <b  >-DPROCESS_OPTIONS</b>. The wrappers are
compiled in this way by my Caldera/Red Hat distribution. To check
your distribution for the advanced options, run
<b  >tcpdchk&lt;\!s&gt;-a</b>. On my system, I see the
following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 6: implicit "allow" at end of rule
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 7: my.isp.net: host not found
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 7: implicit "allow" at end of rule
warning: /etc/hosts.allow, line 8: implicit "allow" at end of rule
</pre><p>The message <b  >implicit&lt;\!s&gt;"allow"</b>
indicates my version of the wrappers is looking for additional
options in the /etc/hosts.allow file. If your distribution does not
have PROCESS_OPTIONS compiled in, you will not see this message.
</p><p>Using the advanced options, we can do away with the
/etc/hosts.deny file entirely, since the options for
<b  >"allow"</b> and <b  >"deny"</b> can be
added to any rule. We can change the logging level, control the
priority (&ldquo;niceness&rdquo;) of the network service, look up user names
with the RFC 931 &ldquo;ident&rdquo; protocol and display customized
&ldquo;banners&rdquo; for each service.</p><p>More information on these advanced features can be found in
the <b  >hosts_options(5)</b> man page included with
TCP_wrappers, or in the Garfinkel &amp; Spafford book cited above
(a must-read for anyone concerned with network security). For now,
let's convert our /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files to use
the advanced options. The etc/hosts.deny file is no longer needed.
In /etc/hosts.allow we rewrite the rules as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ALL        : localhost               : allow
in.telnetd : my.isp.net              : allow
in.fingerd : ALL EXCEPT .cracker.org : allow
in.tftpd   : nasty.bad-guy.com       : spawn \
        (/usr/sbin/safe_finger -l @%h |\
        /bin/mail -s %d-%h root) &amp;
                                     : deny
ALL        : ALL                     : deny
</pre><p>In English, this says the following:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>All services from our own machine are
allowed.</p></li><li><p><b  >telnet</b> is allowed from
<b  >my.isp.net</b>.</p></li><li><p><b  >finger</b> is allowed from
everywhere except hosts in the <b  >cracker.org</b>
domain.</p></li><li><p><b  >tftp</b> is not allowed from
<b  >nasty.badguy.com</b>, and if they try, we will
spring a &ldquo;booby trap&rdquo; to find the guilty party.</p></li><li><p>All other services from everywhere else are
denied.</p></li></ol></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x205aea0"></a>What TCP_wrappers Cannot Do</h2></div></div><p>As we have seen, TCP_wrappers provide a simple and effective
means to control access to our machines. However, we must still
remember &ldquo;There is no secure in computer security, only more
secure or less secure.&rdquo; As with all security measures,
TCP_wrappers have their limitations.</p><p>First and foremost, wrappers cannot control access for those
services started at boot-time and run until system shutdown.
Services like <b  >sendmail</b> and
<b  >httpd</b> (the World Wide Web server) fit this
category. These services are always listening to their own ports
and require their own access controls. Discussions of the security
of <b  >sendmail</b> and the World Wide Web fill entire
volumes and are certainly outside the scope of this article.</p><p>TCP_wrappers may also be vulnerable to &ldquo;host name
spoofing&rdquo;. Services like <b  >rsh</b> and
<b  >rlogin</b> depend on the host name being correct. If
you use a DNS server on which you cannot look up host names, it is
possible for an attacker to &ldquo;spoof&rdquo; the name lookup by hiding his
computer's name behind one your machine &ldquo;trusts&rdquo;. You can thwart
these attacks by putting an entry for the Internet address and host
name in your local /etc/hosts file, so that you do not depend on
outside DNS lookups (an added benefit is that host name lookups are
a lot faster). Be aware that you are now responsible for keeping
the /etc/hosts file up to date. If a computer in the /etc/hosts
file changes its Internet address, access will be denied until you
change its entry. Fortunately, this is a rare event, and I
regularly put entries in my /etc/hosts file for computers I contact
often and for every host allowed access to my machine.</p><p>TCP_wrappers also do some additional homework to avoid name
spoofing attacks. When compiled with the default option
<b  >PARANOID</b> (see the discussion of wild cards
above), the wrappers not only check an Internet address by looking
up its name but also by looking up its address. If the two don't
match, access is automatically denied.</p><p>Another vulnerability can come from &ldquo;source routing&rdquo;, a
situation where a computer from some &ldquo;outside&rdquo; address claims to
be a trusted computer on the &ldquo;inside&rdquo;. TCP_ wrappers can be
compiled with <b  >KILL_IP_OPTIONS</b> to disable source
routing. Luckily, we Linux users generally do not have to worry
about this sort of attack, since IP source routing is turned off by
default in the kernel itself.</p><p>Finally, even though you can use wrappers to control access
to certain services, the best way to avoid exploitation of a
service is to completely shut it off from the beginning. If you
have no use for <b  >rsh</b> or
<b  >rlogin</b>, edit your /etc/inetd.conf file and put a
hash mark, <b  >#</b>, in front of the lines for the
<b  >shell</b> and <b  >login</b> services.
This advice goes for any other service you don't use. Security
holes cannot be exploited on services that are never started.
&ldquo;When in doubt, comment it out&rdquo; is my motto.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c55580.0x205b580"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>TCP_wrappers are cheap and effective tools for controlling
access to your Linux computer. Even without employing the access
control features of wrappers, the ability to trace each and every
connection to your machine through your system logs can be
extremely valuable. TCP_wrappers can control access with a broad
