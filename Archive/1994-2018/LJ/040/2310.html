<span   class="emphasis"><em>Slackware</em></span> series from MIS:Press.</p><p>This volume covers a database that just happens to use Linux
as the underlying platform, which makes it quite different from
most Linux books.</p><p>The first part of the book deals with relational databases
and the second with programming a database application. Both
sections contain good information from which much can be learned
about databases. The word Linux does not appear within the first
section.</p><p>There are three chapters in the first part. The first chapter
introduces the relational modes, the second addresses the
principles of database design and the final chapter introduces
structured query language (SQL). The first chapter deals with
theory and introduces the idea of a baseball team database whose
development is followed throughout. Chapters 2 and 3 include
examples of database issues which are easy for someone with a
programming background to understand.</p><p>The first chapter in Part 2 introduces the architecture of
database applications and presents the three-tier model: access,
business logic and user interface.</p><p>The following chapters introduce the Open DataBase
Connectivity (ODBC) call line interface, the Java DataBase
Connectivity (JDBC) applications program interface and embedded
SQL. The author explains how to actually access a database using
each of these three methods. The focus is on interconnecting the
database with a web page.</p><p>Chapter 6 develops the front ends using both HTML/CGI and
Java. Examples of code and HTML increase at this point in the book.
The final chapter presents what the authors call
<span   class="emphasis"><em>middleware</em></span>, the semantic logic that controls
the actions of the other two tiers.</p><p>Each chapter concludes with a summary and references to other
sources of information, which are both current and the right
choices. The CD includes a standard Slackware distribution of Linux
plus four databases: Just Logic, mSQL, Postres95 and Ingres. The
included version of Just Logic is &ldquo;crippleware&rdquo;--that is, it will
process only 1000 commands. mSQL is free for non-commercial use,
and information on registering for commercial use is included.
Postgres and Ingres are both under the UCB (University of
California Berkeley) copyright, which pretty much grants free use
for any purpose.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Database</em></span> is well written and
fairly easy to read in spite of the fact that much of the material
is rather technical in nature. If you are interested in relational
databases, this book, the included CD, a PC and a lot of time can
get you up to speed. If you aren't a student but have a
professional interest in a relational database, the included tools
and documentation will get you well on your way. Also, having four
databases to work with will help you pick the right tool for your
task.</p></div></div>
