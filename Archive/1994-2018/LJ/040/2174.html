    A description of how the TCFS secure file system works and why
    you
    should use it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24cd3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Current network technology makes it cheap
and convenient to share resources over a network. Typically, a
computer network consists of one server with direct access to a
resource (file system, printers, CPU time). The server then allows
several clients to access the resource. A file system is a typical
resource which can be shared over a network, and Sun's NFS is the
most widespread protocol for file system sharing. An important
feature of NFS is its complete transparency to the application
using it. The application has no need to know whether it is
accessing a file on a local file system or from a file system
shared over a network.
</p><p>NFS, designed by Sun several years ago, does not address the
security issues arising in this context. NFS is simple in structure
and assumes a strong trust model: that is, the user trusts the
remote file system server and the network with his data. This poses
several risks. The data on the server are available to the server
superuser; also, users on the network may assume other identities
by changing their IP numbers or their user IDs, allowing data to be
read while it travels on the network. Because of this, it is
necessary to address the security issues by protecting the data
while stored on a remote server and during network
transfers.</p><p>TCFS (Transparent Cryptographic File System) has been
developed at the Dipartimento di Informatica ed Applicazione of the
Universita' di Salerno (Italy) and is currently available for
Linux. You can look at TCFS as an extended NFS. It acts just like
NFS, but allows a user to protect his/her files using
encryption.</p><p>TCFS requires an NFS server running Linux with the EXT2 file
system. It must be used with 2.0.x kernels, since it is based on
Olaf Kirch's NFS module. TCFS can be used as a kernel module (and
inserted using the <b  >insmod</b> utility) or can be
compiled into the kernel. When you start the TCFS module or when
you boot (if TCFS is statically linked), you will find four copies
of the <b  >tcfsiod</b> daemon running.</p><p>TCFS works as a layer under the VFS (Virtual File system
Switch) layer, making it completely transparent to the
applications. The security is guaranteed by means of the DES (data
encryption standard) algorithm. Keys are kept in a special database
(/etc/tcfspasswd) which stores keys encrypted with the user's login
password. To maximize the level of security, it is best to keep to
a minimum number of trusted entities. A TCFS user needs to trust
only the kernel and the superuser of the client machine accessing
the data. We stress that this minimal level of trust is necessary,
since you cannot protect your data from the kernel and the
superuser. Both can access memory any time that they want. Our
trust model fits perfectly the typical scenario in which TCFS is
used: a network of workstations with limited disk space, each used
almost exclusively by a limited number of users (you can even think
of each user as the superuser of his/her own workstation) and a
remote file server sharing files with all the workstations.</p><p>In designing TCFS we were interested in providing a robust
security mechanism at the lowest possible cost to the user. The
security mechanism must guarantee that secure files are not
readable:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>by any user other than the legitimate owner,</p></li><li><p>by tapping the communication lines between the user
and the remote file system server,</p></li><li><p>by the superuser of the file system server.</p></li></ul></div><p>We also protect sensitive meta data&mdash;for each file; not only
the content but also the filename is encrypted. We hide internal
file data dependencies using a DES in the chaining block
cipher.</p><p>In TCFS, security acts in a transparent way. Secure files can
be accessed in the same way as local files&mdash;the user has only to
authenticate himself to TCFS before starting to work. A special
flag, which looks like an EXT2 extended attribute, marks encrypted
files to make them distinguishable from unencrypted ones. Thus,
TCFS is able to store both secure and unsecure files on the same
file system depending on whether or not this flag is set.</p><p>We give special attention to making TCFS completely
transparent to the file server. Transparency allows the superuser
on a server to perform all administration duties in that we don't
change the data structures of the file system itself. Special work
is needed for a directory with the secure flag enabled. Files in a
secure directory are stored with encrypted filenames, and new files
inherit the secure flag, so that they too are secure. Since TCFS
acts like a file system in a VFS (virtual file system) layer,
standard system calls can be used to access files on the TCFS. No
special flags are needed by the <b  >open()</b> or
<b  >create()</b> system calls. For this reason, all
applications can use the new features without being
recompiled.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24cdb88"></a>The Working of TCFS</h2></div></div><p>To explain the mechanics of TCFS we will first review the
working of NFS. NFS is a simple distributed file system that allows
a file system server to <span   class="emphasis"><em>export</em></span> its file
systems to several clients. Applications, running on a client,
access the remote file system via the usual system calls. The
client kernel checks to see whether the requested data is on a
local file system or an NFS file system. In the latter case, the
kernel issues a request to the server; for example, if the
application needs to read a block from a file on a remote file
system, the client operating system issues a read request to the
server. The server, upon receiving a read request, reads the data
from its local file system and sends it to the client, which then
passes the data to the application. It is important to remember
that NFS provides a minimal form of user authentication. The server
receives from the client the uid of the user requesting the data
and checks if that user is allowed to access the file containing
the data. Thus, it is possible for a user to change his
<b  >uid</b> on the client (for example, the superuser of
the client machine can use the command <b  >su</b> to
become any user) or to modify the NFS client so that a different
<b  >uid</b> is provided with the request.</p><p>When using TCFS, files can be stored in encrypted form on the
server file system with a different encryption key for each user.
The encryption key is provided by the user to the TCFS client
through the <b  >tcfslogin</b> utility. (A detailed
description of the TCFS utilities appears below.) Reading a block
of data from the server is achieved following the NFS protocol,
with one important exception: once the requested block is received
by the TCFS client, it is decrypted before being passed to the
application. Similarly, a block of data written by an application
is encrypted with the user's key before being passed to the TCFS
server. During a read or write operation the user's encryption key
never leaves the TCFS client, and data travels between server and
client only in encrypted form. Moreover, this approach addresses
the problems related to user authentication. While it is still
possible for a user to impersonate the legitimate owner of a file,
he will receive only encrypted data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24cdea0"></a>Installing TCFS&mdash;Server Side</h2></div></div><p>Set up your TCFS server just as you would an NFS server&mdash;by
exporting the file system you wish to share with your clients.
Usually this is done by editing the /etc/exports file and
restarting the NFS daemons (rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd).</p><p>Retrieve <b  >xattrd</b> from the TCFS package. It
can be found in the linux/fs/tcfs/contrib/xattrd directory of the
TCFS distribution. Copy <b  >xattrd</b> to the daemon
directory, usually /usr/sbin, and add it to your rc files. For the
Slackware distribution, edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file to look
like <a href="2174l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. rc.inet2
File</a>.</p><p>For Red Hat or any other distribution using the System V init
script model, create a file in the rc directory (/etc/rc.d/init.d
in Red Hat 4) for starting and stopping the
<b  >xattrd</b> daemon and make symbolic links in the
rc\#.d directories to start it. In Red Hat you can do this using
the <b  >tksysv</b> script. For an example of building
the <b  >xattrd</b> rc scripts, see
<a href="2174l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. File for Building xattrd
Script</a>.</p><p>Now, reboot the system or run <b  >xattrd</b> as
<b  >root</b> to prepare the server for TCFS. Notice that
<b  >xattrd</b> reads /etc/exports at startup and so if
you change /etc/exports, you must restart
<b  >xattrd</b>. <b  >xattrd</b> adds
functionality to the NFS server and is not meant to be a
replacement; therefore, it is possible to use the same server as
both a TCFS server and an NFS server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24ce4d0"></a>Installing TCFS&mdash;Client side</h2></div></div><p>Installing TCFS on the client is somewhat more complex, since
most of the work is performed by the client&mdash;the kernel must be
rebuilt to support TCFS.</p><p>The TCFS distribution provides a tar file to be unpacked in
the /usr/src directory. We assume that the kernel sources are in
the /usr/src/linux directory (this is the standard for most Linux
distributions). Install TCFS with the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Untar TCFS to create the directory
/usr/src/linux/fs/tcfs which contains the code for TCFS and its
related utilities.</p></li><li><p>Apply the tcfs.diff patch found in
/usr/src/linux/fs/tcfs/patches to the kernel. Do this by changing
directories to /usr/src and then typing <b  >patch &lt;
linux/fs/tcfs/patches/tcfs.diff</b>.</p></li><li><p>Recompile the kernel. In the FileSystem section you
will be asked about TCFS. It is possible to install
<b  >tcfs</b> as a module or built-in. In both cases it
is necessary to recompile the kernel following the usual
procedure.</p></li><li><p>Install the utilities. Once a kernel with TCFS
support has been installed, change directory to
/usr/src/linux/fs/tcfs/contrib/binaries where you will find the
binaries for the TCFS utilities, and type
<b  >make&lt;\!s&gt;install</b>. It is also possible to
compile the source code for the TCFS utilities located in
/usr/src/linux/fs/tcfs/contrib/src.</p></li><li><p>Enable use of TCFS. The superuser of the client
must generate a key for each user using the
<b  >tcfsgenkey</b> utility. This requires the user's
password, so it must be done with the help of the user. The utility
<b  >tcfsgenkey</b> builds a database (/etc/tcfspasswd)
where the keys used to encrypt files are stored. These are kept
encrypted using the user's login password as key. In future
releases of TCFS we are planning to provide support for smart
cards, thus dispensing with the need of keeping the key (albeit in
encrypted form) on the client.</p></li><li><p>TCFS utilities. The command mount provided by TCFS
is capable of handling TCFS mount operations. We encourage you to
use our version of <b  >mount</b> in place of the
standard <b  >mount</b> command, since TCFS needs some
information that the standard <b  >mount</b> doesn't
provide. To mount a file system with TCFS, type:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t tcfs server:/remotepath /localpath
</pre><p>TCFS also supplies the <b  >passwd</b> command
which is used to update the encryption key database. It acts like
the standard <b  >passwd</b> command, but also updates
the tcfspasswd file after changing the password. Changing your
password with the old <b  >passwd</b> command will result
in the wrong encryption key being extracted from /etc/tcfspasswd,
and thus, in a complete loss of data.
</p><p>After login, each user has to execute
<b  >tcfslogin</b>. Utility <b  >tcfslogin</b>
requests the user's login password to decrypt the encryption key
and pushes the cipher key in the kernel module. To remove the key,
the user must execute the utility <b  >tcfslogout</b>,
which needs a TCFS file system mounted to work. In future releases
we plan to include support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication
Module), making it unnecessary to input the login password
twice.</p><p>The <b  >lsattr</b> and <b  >chattr</b>
commands act just as they do in EXT2. The TCFS versions support a
new flag, <b  >X</b>, to enable encryption of files. You
can change status of a file (encrypt or decrypt) by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chattr $ &lt;+|-&gt; $X
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24c5ac8"></a>An Example</h2></div></div><p>Suppose you have a server named <b  >foo</b> and a
client named <b  >bar</b> and suppose you export the
directory tree named /exports from server <b  >foo</b> to
client <b  >bar</b>. For this to be true
<b  >foo</b> must have the following line in
/etc/exports:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/exports       bar(rw,insecure)
</pre><p>Now, login as <b  >root</b> on
<b  >bar</b> and <b  >mount</b> /exports by
typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t tcfs foo:/exports /mnt/tcfs
</pre>


This command causes the remote file system, /exports@foo, to be
mounted on the local file system, /mnt/tcfs@localhost, via a TCFS
layer.
</p><p>Now, suppose your login is <b  >usdm1</b>, and you
own a directory named /mnt/tcfs/usdm1. Login as
<b  >usdm1</b> on <b  >bar</b> and execute
<b  >tcfslogin</b>; doing so enables you to use
encryption in your directory /mnt/tcfs/usdml. If
<b  >tcfslogin</b> is not issued, a permission denied
error will be issued when attempting to access files with the
<b  >X</b> flag set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d5580.0x24c6200"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>In order to evaluate the overhead introduced by encryption of
the data sent over the network, we performed a set of tests. We ran
the test in the following framework:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The client machine running TCFS on the Linux 2.0.23
kernel is a Cyrix x686 166MHz processor</p></li><li><p>The server machine running as the NFS+xattrd file
server is an Intel Pentium 133MHz processor with a 2GB fast SCSI
disk.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since encryption/decryption is a CPU-bound task, having a
fast client to perform encryption results in better performance.
TCFS makes use of standard VFS caches&mdash;no special caching is
needed.</p><p>The real time values shown in <a href="2174t1.html" target="_self">Table
1</a> and <a href="2174t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a> were
obtained using the <b  >time</b> command with the
following options set for the read operations:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
time dd bs=xxx if=file of=/dev/null count=n
</pre><p>and for the write operations:
<pre     class="programlisting">
time dd bs=xxx if=/dev/zero of=file count=n
</pre>


</p><p>The tables show the following results:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The overall performance of TCFS for write
operations is close to NFS performances plus DES overhead. In the
write, we suffer due to the lack of a cache system, since data are
written directly to the server file system.</p></li><li><p>The performance of TCFS for read operations seems
to hide part of the DES time, since VFS caches reduce server
I/O.</p></li><li><p>Some extra cost is paid by TCFS for I/O of
unencrypted files due to handling of extended attributes. In NFS
several <b  >getattr</b> calls are needed to update inode
caching. In TCFS we need a <b  >getattr</b> and a
<b  >geteattr</b> to update inode caching. This causes
some extra overhead in TCFS I/O.</p></li></ul></div><p>Use of other ciphers will result in different performances.
We are planning to use IDEA, RC5 and other ciphers as optional
modules for TCFS.</p><p><a href="2174s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
