    Tripwire is a program designed to help you discover if
    someone is tampering with your system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe74580.0xf6c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>You run the latest Linux kernel, read the
Linux-security-alert mailing list, install security patches as soon
as they come out. Your Linux machine is secure. Right?
</p><p>Alas, it's not very likely. Even if you install the newest
patch, someone might have already compromised your machine and
replaced your system binaries without your knowing it. In that
case, fixing the hole which allowed them entrance is just part of
your problem. Even with quick turn around in the Linux community
(we have the source code after all) for security vulnerabilities
being spotted and someone coming out with a fix for it, there will
always be a window of opportunity for someone to compromise your
machine.</p><p>What more can you do to close this window? How can you know
when some intruder has broken it? Enter Tripwire. Tripwire has a
pretty simple concept. It takes checksums of all your important
files; then later, you can check your files against the Tripwire
database and determine if any change or tampering has occurred. The
current version of Tripwire (1.2.2) has not been updated since
08/94, so it is a very stable program. There is not much that can
go wrong with it.</p><p>Some cracker tools have been designed to modify or replace
system binaries (<b  >login, telnetd, vmlinuz, ps,
ls,</b> etc) and then make them appear to be the same as
before. Usually the methods are crude, consisting of just the
modification of the date and size of the file (back to their
original values). A casual glance shows all to be fine. Some
intruder tools even try to get the modified or replaced binary to
match a simple checksum. For instance, change the binary so it will
pass a simple test such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cmp /bin/login /cdrom/untouched/bin/login
</pre><p>In order to make sure this doesn't happen, Tripwire is
capable of using all sorts of checksumming algorithms. Tripwire
comes with: The RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5, MD4 and MD2 Message
Digest Algorithms, Snefru (the Xerox Secure Hash Function), SHA
(the Secure Hash Algorithm) and Haval code. The authors of Tripwire
suggest that MD5 is sufficient for most checksumming, and critical
files might also be checked with Snefru. Checking with one checksum
like MD5 is pretty good, but imagine the difficulty of creating a
binary or file that passes 2 or 3 (or more) different checksums.
Few system intruders have the time/resources to even make the
attempt.
</p><p>Using the Tripwire database, you can check all your critical
files for tampering. Now, how do you know if someone has tampered
with your Tripwire binary or Tripwire database? After all, if the
intruder can modify your Tripwire database, you are back to square
one.</p><p>Several different methods exist. The easiest, and I think the
best for most security conscious Linux users, is to place Tripwire
and the Tripwire database on a read-only floppy disk. Since most
Linux machines have a floppy drive and few are in use all the time,
it's a good match. The Tripwire authors also suggest that if you
are very concerned, you can print out the Tripwire database. It's
hard to imagine an intruder being able to modify documents printed
before they broke in. Other possible schemes include: remote
mounting the Tripwire binary and database from another more secure
machine read-only, putting it on a write-protected Zip disk, or
even getting an old, small hard drive that has been jumpered to
hardware enable read-only and put it on that. The idea is to put it
on some media that you can make read-only in hardware. It does you
no good to place Tripwire where an intruder can mess with it. If
the machine you want to check is in a place accessible to many
people, keep your Tripwire floppy in a safe location and bring it
to the machine only when you want to check your files. You can also
NFS mount it from a remote, more secure machine with a
floppy.</p><p>Okay, you've decided to install it. How do you go about that?
Well, grab the latest Tripwire source (Tripwire 1.2 patch level 2).
It should compile just fine under most Linux distributions. I had
no problems compiling it under a Red Hat 4.0 system out of the box.
Read through the README file for a quick overview, and if you want
more details, take a look at the PostScript design paper. There is
also a Tripwire RPM available, but I would recommend against using
it, as you can't specify where it should be installed.</p><p>Make the choice of the directory where your Tripwire binary
and Tripwire database will reside before you compile. Tripwire hard
codes these paths to prevent tampering.</p><p>Once Tripwire is compiled, take your machine down to
single-user mode. I know, you don't want to lose that many months
uptime, but you must make sure you are the only one on the system
and no one has a remote connection to your machine that can be used
for tampering. If you are particularly concerned, you might
consider a clean install of your system before installing Tripwire
in order to be sure all your binaries are clean. In single-user
mode, mount the media on which to place Tripwire and the Tripwire
database. (Mount it read/write this time, so you can copy Tripwire
onto it.)</p><p>Install Tripwire. Next, determine what binaries are important
for Tripwire to check. It is almost useless to check files that
change a lot (user files). Tripwire is mainly for your important
system binaries. My Tripwire configuration checks: <b  >/etc,
/sbin, /bin, /usr/bin, /lib</b> and
<b  >/vmlinuz</b>; it also checks some files in
<b  >/dev</b>. Even these are going to change more than
you might think. If you select too much, your Tripwire reports are
going to be too full of hits for you to notice a real
break-in.</p><p>After you get your <b  >tw.config</b> file set up
for the directories you want to change, it's time to make your new,
clean Tripwire database. Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire -init
</pre><p>Relax for a while. It takes Tripwire a fair amount of time to
generate all the checksums. Using just the default MD5 checksum on
all the directories I mentioned above takes my dual 166MHz Pentium
about 5 minutes (faster disks would help).
</p><p>After Tripwire has finished creating the database, remove
your Tripwire media and make it read-only (jumper, write-protect
notch, etc). Then, bring your machine back up to full multiuser
mode and mount your Tripwire media.</p><p>Now, to make sure things are working, try changing a file in
one of the directories listed in the Tripwire database. Run
Tripwire and make sure it catches it. It will output a very nice,
verbose report showing which files have changed and in what way
they have changed (modify time, checksum, etc).</p><p>I have my Tripwire set up to run each night in a
<b  >cron</b> job and mail the results to me. You can
have yours do the same or just run it when you suspect something is
wrong. I would recommend you run it pretty often. You never can
tell when you might be compromised. Checking a short Tripwire
report every day is a small investment in security that can really
pay off. You can still rerun Tripwire whenever you think there
might be a reason for it. (Keep in mind that an intruder might
modify your mail from the <b  >cron</b> job to make it
look like nothing happened.) For that reason, I also run Tripwire
periodically when I have nothing else going on (while &ldquo;on hold&rdquo;
for those long tech support calls, etc).</p><p>You will find that as you update packages and config files,
your Tripwire database flags more and more files; periodically, you
need to take your machine back down to single-user mode, remount
your Tripwire media read/write and update your database with a
different command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire -interactive
</pre><p>Make sure you know why each file is different now. If you are
at all unsure, don't update that file in the database; instead,
replace it with a fresh copy off your distribution site or CD-ROM
and then rerun Tripwire.
</p><p>It's that simple. You now have a nice detector capable of
telling you when someone has been tampering with your files, and
the peace of mind that comes with knowing your Linux box is the
most secure one on your network.</p></div></div>
