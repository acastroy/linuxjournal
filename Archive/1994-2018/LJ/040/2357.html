books and also in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Configuration and

Sutton</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a1580.0x2a9a528"></a>Different Levels of Operation</h2></div></div><p>A Unix run level is a state of system configuration. Each
level signifies a certain level of operation. The run levels are
controlled (and are relevant to) the <b  >init</b>
daemon, which is the first process that is executed when any Unix
system is first loaded.</p><p><b  >init</b>'s job is to start and stop processes,
and the run levels help determine which to control. The file
/etc/inittab contains entries that <b  >init</b> uses to
decide which processes to start and how to start them. An entry
looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NM:LEVs:WHEN_AND_HOW:COMMAND
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em><b>NM</b> is a two-letter identifier
for the command&mdash;each command must have its own, unique identifier.
<b>LEVs</b> is a list of levels during which to run the
command. It is typically a number or set of numbers from 0-5 but
can also be an <b>S</b> or even nothing, depending on
your version of <b>init</b>.
<b>WHEN_AND_HOW</b> is an option specifying when the
command should be run, whether <b>init</b> should wait
for it to finish or not, whether it should be restarted when it
dies and so on. <b>COMMAND</b> is the full path and
file name of the command to execute.</em></span>
</p><p>The run level corresponds to the <b  >LEVs</b>
list. For example, the following lines are in my inittab
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Start the local dial-in services
s0:45:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyS0 \
        vt100 -D -x 0
s1:45:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyS2 \
        vt100 -D -x 0
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>I have defined two processes, <b>s0</b>
and <b>s1</b>, which will be executed any time the
system is in run levels 4 or 5. The <b>respawn</b>
option tells <b>init</b> to re-execute the command when
the command terminates. (This allows my dial-in lines to accept the
new callers when users hang up.) Finally, you can see the command
that is run for each entry.</em></span>
</p><p>By using run levels, a system administrator can configure a
system to automatically start and stop certain processes when they
put their systems into different run levels. The most common use
for this capability is to have a normal, multi-user level and a
single-user administration level. By triggering this level, they
can have their servers automatically terminate user processes and
disable network support in order to administer their
systems.</p><p>You can get more information on Unix run levels from the
<span   class="bold"><b>INIT(8)</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>INITTAB(5)</b></span> man pages. Since many
different Unix flavors exist, there are also many different
versions of <b  >init</b>. So, you should examine your
man pages for exact details. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services

will crash and a core dump file is output. When I try to read them
(using the <b  >more</b> command) they are full of
meaningless characters. I have yet to find anything on how to read
these files except for a debugger for debugging the programs that
caused the dump&mdash;I never know which program caused the core dump.
Any ideas on other avenues of determining what happened? &mdash;G.
Hendricks</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a1580.0x2a919c0"></a>Using gcc and gdb</h2></div></div><p>Core dump files are process states for the process that died.
When a process terminates with one of various signals (such as
<b  >SIGSEGV</b>, the segment violation, typically
indicating a memory-related bug in the program) and the process
owner's <b  >ulimit</b> (see your shell's man page)
allows for core files, a core dump will be created. It contains
information such as the entire set of memory allocated to the
program, where the program was when it died and what it was
doing.</p><p>A core dump is an invaluable tool to Unix programmers. By
using it in conjunction with a debugger, a programmer can see what
went wrong with his or her program.</p><p>To examine one of these files, you typically need two things.
First, the program must be compiled and linked using
<b  >gcc</b> with the <b  >-g</b> switch set,
which instructs the compiler to place debugging information in the
executable. Although any program can produce a core file, the core
file can only tell a programmer the location in the program where
the fault occurred and the values of certain variables if this
debugging information is available.</p><p>The second tool that is required is the debugger. If you have
installed the development kit, chances are you already have this.
The standard Linux debugger is <b  >gdb</b> (the GNU
Debugger) and is part of the gcc development kit. A programmer
might then use this command to look at a core file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gdb programname core
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Core files are typically useful only to
programmers, and a debugger is not a very friendly program
(<b>gdb</b> is certainly no exception). If you have no
programming experience, you will probably not increase your
knowledge of what went wrong by examining a core file in this
way. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services
