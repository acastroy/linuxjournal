    How one university uses PGP and digital signatures to make its
    network secure.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a6580.0x149e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>PGP and public-key cryptography are used
all the time for encrypting e-mail and other kinds of messages.
They can also be used in other interesting ways. This article
describes two other uses for PGP and digital signatures that can
help make networks more secure. The University of Maryland
University College European Division (quite a mouthful) has 65
Linux-based computer labs in 10 countries. A Linux box in each lab
serves files via NFS to Windows/Linux dual-boot clients. The labs
are spread out over a huge geographical area, and many are hard to
reach. We depend on Linux's reliability to make the system work. At
the &ldquo;education centers&rdquo;, there is usually no technical support.
If a network is down, someone from Computer Field Support must go
to the center on an overnight trip to fix it.
</p><p>To keep things as maintenance-free as possible, we have to
develop some secure and reliable systems for managing the networks
and the users. The two systems talked about here both use
&ldquo;clear-signed digital signatures&rdquo; to accomplish their goals. One
is a system to securely transmit software upgrades; this has been
implemented in Perl and is in use today. The second is a system for
remotely authenticating users without the need to access a user
database. This one is in the design/specification stage.</p><p>There are pointers to information about getting started with
cryptography at the end of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a6580.0x149e500"></a>Securely Transmitting Software Upgrades</h2></div></div><p>We realized we needed a security system when it came time to
upgrade the software on our lab servers. We had to install new
versions of the client programs, make modifications to the server
config files and other changes. We knew that, in many cases, the
upgrades must be able to be made by people with little computer
knowledge. The fact that server system files might have to be
modified in a particular upgrade meant that superuser privileges
would have to be given out. The three situations we wished to
prevent were:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Simple media unreliability&mdash;the software was going
to be delivered via a network connection, on zip drive disks or on
conventional floppies. The system would have to protect itself
against flaws in the media, such as a floppy disk with bad sectors.
The system should refuse to begin the installation if any part of
the package is bad.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Man in the middle&rdquo; attack&mdash;in general, an attack
in which someone alters the data after it's been sent, but before
it's been received. Once the floppies arrive at the education
center, they're left lying around on the user's desk for a while. A
curious (or devious) student can pick them up and add some special
configuration files to be installed. Since superuser access is
given to the upgrade program, someone could modify the contents of
the packages and gain root access.</p></li><li><p>Unauthorized upgrades&mdash;our goal of making the
upgrades as easy as possible works for approved
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> unapproved users. An attacker who gets
access to one of our upgrade floppies could figure out the file
formats and create new upgrades that would change any system
files.</p></li></ol></div><p>These three problems can be summed up as a must to verify
integrity and authenticity. We must make sure that the data has not
been altered, deleted or added to in any way. We must also make
sure that the data comes from the approved source&mdash;in this case
from our Computer Field Support group. Integrity and authenticity
are exactly the functions digital signatures provide. The following
protocol solves our problem:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Computer Field Support (CFS) generates a public and
private key pair.</p></li><li><p>A package file listing is generated.</p></li><li><p>An MD5 checksum is generated for each file and
listed in a second column. See <a href="2304l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>This two-column listing is digitally clear-signed
with CFS's secret key. This compromises the certificate delivered
with the software package. See <a href="2304l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>At installation time, the digital signature is
checked using CFS's public key, which is stored on the
server.</p></li><li><p>An MD5 checksum is generated for each file in the
package and checked against the corresponding string in the
certificate.</p></li><li><p>The installation program in the package is
executed.</p></li></ol></div><p>Using this system, a file can't be modified, because the MD5
checksums wouldn't match in step 6. The checksums in the
certificate can't be altered, because the certificate's digital
signature would fail in step 5. PGP and md5sum are called from
shell or Perl scripts to do all the work. The script that creates
the certificate is very simple and doesn't require the user to know
how to use PGP. All he needs to know is the correct pass phrase to
enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
rm listing.asc 2&gt; /dev/null
md5sum * | pgp -staf &gt; listing.asc
</pre><p>The user in the field runs another program, which also calls
PGP and md5sum. The certificates are more secure when clear-signed
than when encrypted, because at this stage we don't rely on any
&ldquo;secrets&rdquo; being stored on the remote servers. Only the CFS public
key is sent into the field. If anyone breaks into one of our
computers, the information in the public key is harmless. When we
encrypt the certificates, we need to make a second public/private
key set for the servers themselves. The private key would be stored
on the server and used to decrypt the messages, which would be
something &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; for crackers to get by. Decrypting the
messages also means that a pass phrase must be given to PGP. Either
the user would have to enter it, or it would have to be a
hard-coded parameter to a program. Since our current system needs
to verify only a clear-signed message by using a public key, PGP
doesn't need a pass phrase. This makes the installation process
easier and safer.
</p><p>CERT's method for releasing software patches uses a similar
system. They digitally sign e-mail messages and README files
containing the checksums of files to be downloaded. People who take
the time to verify the checksums can easily find out whether the
files have been modified.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a6580.0x149f108"></a>Weaknesses</h2></div></div><p>This system has a couple of weaknesses. For one thing, it
offers only file-level protection. It checks all the logical
possibilities of modified files, deleted files and extra files.
What about someone modifying the disk in some strange way that
fools the upper level routines? Digitally signing a representation
of the raw disk data is more secure.</p><p>This system is also vulnerable if the public key on the
server could be modified or replaced with a different one. The same
vulnerability exists for the upgrade software on the server. In
practice, getting root access in order to replace the public key
and creating unauthorized upgrades is a roundabout way to launch an
attack. If the attacker already had root access on a particular
computer, there wouldn't be any reason to use the upgrade system to
get privileges or modify the server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a6580.0x149f268"></a>Authenticating Users without a Database</h2></div></div><p>With the labs gradually coming on-line, we're dealing with
the problem of authenticating student access. Most schools can just
put a login program on their client PCs which checks the user's
password against a central database via a high-speed campus LAN.
This won't work for us for many reasons. Many of our labs will not
be on-line in the near future. Even when on-line, the network
support is unreliable and often slow. Another problem is that we
have lots of weekend seminars students sign up for at the last
minute. The students sign up for classes in small &ldquo;education
centers&rdquo; that send us floppy disks with registration information
via snail-mail long after the fact. Even if every lab were on-line,
the logistics of collecting and distributing all of the information
overnight would be extremely difficult. Luckily, public key
cryptography and clear-signed digital signatures offer a
solution:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A public and private key pair are generated for use
by Field Representatives (FRs).</p></li><li><p>The FR public key is stored on the computer lab
servers.</p></li><li><p>At registration time, a student entitled to
computer lab access brings a floppy disk to the FR.</p></li><li><p>The FR clear-signs a certificate with the student's
name, ID number, dates of validity and, optionally, information
about which privileges are granted.</p></li><li><p>At least five characters are removed from the
digital signature block and given to the student as his
&ldquo;password&rdquo;. In <a href="2304l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>, the
last five characters of the second encrypted line were used as the
password.</p></li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The first time a student uses any particular
computer lab, he inserts the disk into a client PC and enters his
student ID number and password. The password and certificate on the
disk are recombined and sent to the server where it is checked
using the FR's public key. If the signature is both valid and
unexpired (based on the dates in the certificate), access is
granted.</p></li><li><p>One final step makes the system more convenient for
students when returning to a lab. The server maintains a simple
database, keyed on the student ID number with the student's
password encrypted with a standard one-way encryption routine like
<b  >crypt(1)</b>. The next time a student visits that
particular lab, he doesn't need to bring the floppy disk; he can
just enter his password and be validated.</p></li><li><p>This database is automatically managed in the same
way as a DNS cache. The date of expiration from the user's
certificate becomes a &ldquo;time to live&rdquo; field in their database
record. A <b  >cron</b> job can be set up to periodically
delete all expired entries.</p></li></ol></div><p>This scheme has a lot of advantages. Reliable communication
between the field staff, the main office and the labs is not
required. Each of the three can be in completely separate, isolated
locations. (And this is often the case.)</p><p>As in the first system, no real &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; are stored on the
lab servers. If someone gets access to a lab server, there's no
information that can help him: the public key can be read by
anyone. The encrypted passwords are stored on the server; however,
since they're random strings and not picked by the users, they
aren't susceptible to the typical dictionary attack. Apart from
dictionary attacks, standard Unix passwords are usually a secure
system.</p><p>Various user access levels and periods of validity can be
assigned to students by adding them to the certificates. The
certificate can contain more information than just the student's
name and ID number. Any kind of information that's worth keeping
track of can be put into it.</p><p>Students have instant access to the computer lab once they've
received their certificate. There is no delay waiting for a
database to be propagated.</p><p>Since the certificates are in plain text, students can see at
a glance if the certificates are correct, if they've expired yet,
etc. This should make the system user-friendlier, and also limit
the amount of assistance needed for help desk calls. There would
never be any question about whether a certificate was still valid,
issued for the correct person or contained the correct
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a6580.0x149fc60"></a>Weaknesses</h2></div></div><p>This scheme reduces the security requirements in the labs,
but increases the precautions that need to be taken in the Field
Staff's offices. Their PCs will have the secret keys on them, and
plans should be made for when a computer is &ldquo;compromised&rdquo;. A
possible fix is to give each education center a separate key set
and put all possible public keys on the servers. If a
system/key/passphrase is stolen, that particular key set is revoked
and not used any more.</p><p><a href="2304s1.html" target="_self">PGP and MD5 Resources</a></p></div></div>
