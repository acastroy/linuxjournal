monitor option</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: David Walker</p></li></ul></div><p>Do you have an Internet server that needs to be on-line 24
hours a day, 7 days a week dependably? A hardware watchdog timer is
one way to be sure such a system is down for a minimal length of
time. One such board is the PC Watchdog System Monitoring Board
made by Berkshire Products.</p><p>I reviewed the PC Watchdog (rev. C) with the temperature
monitoring option, part number 1090-1. From the manual: &ldquo;The PC
Watchdog board is a short, 8-bit ISA card that is used to monitor a
PC to ensure maximum system availability.&rdquo;</p><p>The board can monitor a PC's activity in several ways to
determine if it has locked up. Dip switches on the board can be set
to monitor specific I/O addresses for activity. If the PC Watchdog
board does not detect activity on the monitored addresses for the
specified period of time, it reboots the machine.</p><p>The board has a user I/O port that can be used for enhanced
watchdog control and monitoring. This is the same interface used by
the Linux kernel PC watchdog driver and PC watchdog daemon. If an
I/O port on the board is not written to within the specified time,
the board reboots the machine.</p><p>The board came packed in an anti-static bag in a box with a
manual and a 3.5-inch MS-DOS disk of MS-DOS software, including
source code. The manual covers the details of the hardware
thoroughly. However, it did not specifically describe a Linux
installation, and no Linux software is included on the disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5b30"></a>Platforms</h2></div></div><p>The PC Watchdog comes with software drivers for MS-DOS/MS
Windows. Linux support is available with the kernel and on the
Internet. The board works with Intel architecture motherboards and
requires one ISA slot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5c38"></a>Setup and Installation</h2></div></div><p>The board uses three dip switches to configure its operation.
I configured the board in order to ignore I/O activity as the Linux
driver writes to the user I/O port to keep the board from resetting
the PC. I set the address of the user I/O port to 0x0270 and set
the delay time to one minute. My switch settings are shown in
Figure 1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e5d40"></a>Figure 1. Board Switch Settings</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2102f2.jpg"></div><p>I compiled the Linux 2.0.28 kernel with the PC Watchdog
driver enabled as a module. I also compiled the watchdog daemon
from watchdog_2.0-0.tar.gz (from sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/system/Admin) and added it to /etc/rc.d/rc.local. I
created /dev/watchdog and /dev/temperature with the major and minor
device numbers specified in the kernel documentation on the
watchdog (linux/Documentation/watchdog.txt).</p><p>When all was ready, I shut down my machine, turned off the
power and installed the PC Watchdog board in an ISA slot, following
the instructions in the manual.</p><p>A wire on the board connects to the reset connecter on the
motherboard. The wire from the reset switch connects to another
connecter on the Watchdog board, so that the reset switch on the
case will still work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6000"></a>Making It Work</h2></div></div><p>When I turned the power on, my machine booted. After a
3.5-minute delay, the PC Watchdog beeped then rebooted my machine.
After a few reboots I disconnected the wire from the board to the
reset connector until I could figure out how to make the software
work correctly.</p><p>I sent e-mail to Berkshire Products
(73201.1270@compuserve.com) for any information they might have on
Linux. Simon Machell promptly replied referring me to Ken Hollis
(khollis@bitgate.com) who wrote the kernel driver for the PC
Watchdog board.</p><p>While I waited to hear from Ken, I found a bug in the kernel
driver. After I fixed this bug, the example watchdog daemon from
linux/Documentation/watchdog.txt and the daemon from
watchdog_2.0-0.tar.gz worked.</p><p><a href="2102l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is my patch to fix
the kernel driver included with Linux-2.0.28. It may also work with
other kernels&mdash;your mileage may vary.</p><p>Ken directed me to the latest driver he has written:
ftp://ftp.bitgate.com/pub/mirrors/bitgate/pcwd/pcwd-1.01.tar.gz. I
got the tar file, looked at the contents, then patched my kernel
source tree with the patch file patch-2.0.15.</p><p>Patching linux/drivers/char/pcwd.c and
linux/include/linux/pcwd.h wasn't successful, so I copied
pcwd-2.0.27.c to linux/drivers/char/pcwd.c and pcwd.h to
linux/include/linux/pcwd.h. The watchdog driver then compiled
successfully.</p><p>The new driver does not work with the daemons for the older
driver; it comes with a new daemon. The driver works correctly with
the included daemon. The daemon included with the driver lacks one
useful feature: the daemon from watchdog_2.0-0.tar.gz. It doesn't
fork when it writes to /dev/watchdog, so it won't reboot the
machine if the process table gets full.</p><p>I modified the daemon to fork before writing to
/dev/watchdog, so a full process table will cause a reboot of the
machine. <a href="2102l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is the patch to
watchdog.c from pcwd-1.01.tar.gz.</p><p>I did try compiling the PC Watchdog driver as part of the
kernel, but it caused an error and wasn't initialized properly. It
works fine compiled as a module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6478"></a>Setting Up the System <span   class="emphasis"><em>rc</em></span>
Files</h2></div></div><p>The module must be loaded, and the watchdog daemon started
before the file systems are fsck-ed. Fsck-ing the file systems can
take longer than the delay built into the Watchdog board. I put the
following commands to load the module and start the daemon in my
/etc/rc.d/rc.S file (Slackware initialization files) before the
file systems are checked.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# load the watchdog module and
# start the watchdog daemon
if [ -x /lib/modules/2.0.28/misc/pcwd.o ]; then
  echo -loading watchdog module'
  /sbin/insmod 'f /lib/modules/2.0.28/misc/pcwd.o
if [ -x /usr/sbin/watchdog ]; then
  echo -starting watchdog daemon-
  /usr/sbin/watchdog -t 10 &amp;
fi
</pre><p>At this time, the root file system is mounted read-only so
<span   class="emphasis"><em>depmod</em></span> cannot be run to build the modules.dep
file. Therefore, <span   class="emphasis"><em>kerneld</em></span> won't be able to load
the watchdog module when a new kernel is installed.
</p><p>A generic link to the module directory can't be made at this
time either; therefore, the full path name to the module must be
used here. The path to the module must be updated when a new kernel
is installed to insure that an old module is not loaded.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6790"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>I tested the board by killing the watchdog daemon and running
a program that forked until the process table was full. The system
did not experience any failures on its own during testing.</p><p>The PC Watchdog can also monitor the temperature of the
machine, although the kernel driver does not support reading the
temperature. I wrote a short program to read and print the
temperature reported by the board (see
<a href="2102l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>). As I heated the board
with a hair dryer, my program reported the rising temperature and
the board started beeping an alarm when the temperature reached 56
degrees Celsius. The board does have an option to hold the PC in a
reset state when the temperature exceeds 60 degrees Celsius by
closing a relay. A daemon could be written to send e-mail or call a
pager when the temperature gets too high or to shut down the
PC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6948"></a>Comparison with Other Products</h2></div></div><p>Industrial Computer Source makes the WDT Watchdog Timer
Hardware board, for which there is also a Linux kernel driver. It's
available from Industrial Computer Source (619-677-0877 in the USA,
01-243-533900 in the UK, and (1) 69.18.74.30 France). It appears
similar to the PC Watchdog board, though I've not used it.</p><p>A software watchdog driver is also available for the Linux
kernel. The software watchdog cannot reboot the system from some
lockups nor does it have a temperature sensor. The hardware boards
should reboot the system after any lockup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ed580.0x18e6aa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The PC Watchdog is a well-designed, well-made board. During
my three weeks of testing, it operated dependably. The board never
reset the PC unnecessarily, and it never failed to reset the
machine when needed.</p><p><a href="2102s1.html" target="_self">Berkshire Products</a></p></div></div>
