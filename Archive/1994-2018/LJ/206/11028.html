CyanogenMod is a full-blown Android distro you can install on your
phone, whether your cell-phone provider wants you to or not.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f2580.0x27ea300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In order to run the latest version of Android, users normally have to be
using the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; Google handset. Unfortunately, that often requires
using a different cell-phone provider, and it limits purchasing options
significantly. In fact, it limits options to a specific handful of
devices like the Nexus One and Nexus S. Because the Nexus devices don't
have a slider keyboard and come on the T-Mobile network, they're not
a viable option for me.
</p><p>
Enter CyanogenMod.
</p><p>
For users comfortable with rooting their phones, CyanogenMod offers many,
many more features than the stock ROMs available for supported
handsets.
I have an original Motorola Droid from Verizon, and if I stick with
the stock ROM, I will be stuck with Android 2.2. The current version
of CyanogenMod, version 7, includes the Android 2.3 operating system.
Code-named &ldquo;Gingerbread&rdquo;, Android 2.3 includes all the latest bells
and whistles from Google that normally would be available only on the
Nexus S. Thanks to the CyanogenMod team, we can have those features now&mdash;features like:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
New on-screen keyboard with better responsiveness and a cleaner layout.
</p></li><li><p>
Easier selection tools for copying and pasting.
</p></li><li><p>
A new Marketplace application with a Web-based companion for installing apps from
your desktop browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated VoIP calling.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although the new 2.3 features are great, the real beauty behind CyanogenMod
is the customization options. Some of the same
functionality can be added to the stock ROM for your phone by adding
a replacement launcher, but CyanogenMod includes most of the bells and
whistles by default. Some of the more exciting features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The ability to change the lock screen's layout.
</p></li><li><p>
Highly customizable ADWLauncher installed by default.
</p></li><li><p>
Improved pull-down status bar with power options.
</p></li><li><p>
Visual improvements like screen snapping shut when powering off, customizable
virtual desktops, resizable widgets and more.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
CyanogenMod is so customizable, it's often frustrating to show off,
because it can look so drastically different from install to install.
To answer the question, &ldquo;What does CyanogenMod 7 look like?&rdquo;, the best
answer is truly, &ldquo;However you want it to look!&rdquo;

Figure 2. The lock screen is extremely customizable, and it can be themed
to look like SenseUI, Honeycomb or completely custom with added
functionality.

Figure 4. The pull-down menu has power modification tools available.
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and so on can be toggled quickly to save battery life.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11028f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. With a few simple tweaks, the CyanogenMod home screen has a new
theme, tightly packed icons, removed labels and more. If the included
themes aren't to your liking, more are available on-line.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to have the latest version of Android on your phone, but
you don't want to wait for the cell-phone provider to release an update, or
if you have an older handset (like my original Droid) that likely
never will see an update beyond Android 2.2, CyanogenMod is the tool for you.
Most phones are supported after rooting, and even older phones perform
well with Android 2.3, especially if you overclock them. For more
details or to download the latest version of CyanogenMod, check out
<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com" target="_self">www.cyanogenmod.com</a>. The easiest way to install it on your
rooted phone is with ROM Manager, however. It's a simple download from
the Marketplace, and the free version includes support for the stable
version of CyanogenMod.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f2580.0x27eb7f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Got Root?</b></p><p>
The first step to installing a custom ROM like CyanogenMod is to
&ldquo;root&rdquo; your phone. Rooting doesn't change the way your phone
behaves;
instead it gives you superuser (sudo-like) access to the system.
Once your phone is rooted, you can do things like install a custom ROM,
overclock your CPU, set up wireless tethering (which may violate your
cell-phone contract) and even do simple things that shouldn't require
root, like take screenshots.
</p><p>
Rooting an Android phone is usually extremely simple. Typically, all it
takes is a simple search on Google for the model of Android phone you have
along with the word &ldquo;root&rdquo;. For instructions on how to root several
different model phones, sites like <a href="http://www.droid-life.com" target="_self">www.droid-life.com</a> can be helpful
as well.
</p><p>
Remember, &ldquo;rooting&rdquo; your phone doesn't change very much on its own.
It just gives you the ability to change things. With great power comes
great responsibility, however, so be careful with your rooted
phone.
Just like with a desktop version of Linux, the power of root can get
you into trouble!

Steve Kondik: the Man behind the Mod</h2></div></div><p>
While I explored CyanogenMod version 7, I got really excited about how
quickly development in the Android world was progressing. I decided
to contact Steve Kondik, CyanogenMod's creator, and ask him a few
questions. (Thanks to my programmer friend Russ Ryba for helping me come
up with some of the more programming-centric questions.)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> CyanogenMod is one of, if not the, most popular custom ROMs for
Android phones. What motivated you to start the project?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> I've always tried to customize desktop Linux, trying to make
things smoother and faster. When I learned about how the G1 worked,
and that I was able to change anything I wanted, I started off with
rebuilding the kernel with different tweaks. Then I realized that I
could rebuild the whole system from source and flash it to the phone
with everything working perfectly&mdash;that's when the doors opened up.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Installing a custom ROM requires a rooted phone. Rooting your
phone is something that cell-phone companies generally frown upon. Have
you gotten any unfriendly correspondence from either a cell-phone provider
or Google?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> Yeah, and it's still a gray area with regard to firmware and
proprietary drivers. When CM started to get big, Google made me very
aware of the line between the open-source code and the closed portions
(like the Google apps, such as Gmail), so I had to stop including those.
CM doesn't ship with those parts now, so we leave it in the users' hands
on how to get that functionality back.
</p><p>
It seems like carriers and manufacturers are starting to realize
that these are more than just phones, and some even are embracing the
community by releasing their own code as open source. T-Mobile recently
open-sourced its theme engine, which we are using in CM7. Qualcomm and
TI release code for their reference boards. Now we are finally starting
to see more devices that are unlockable out of the box.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> You support a huge number of devices;
I'm curious to know how much of
CyanogenMod needs to be ported specifically to an individual handset,
and how much is generic across the board. Does the wide variety of
devices make releases difficult?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> A lot of devices are similar, but there
always are subtle
differences. Usually it has to do with the secondary processors on these
devices and offloading media encoding/decoding, or special hardware
like cameras and GPS. In some cases, we've had to reverse-engineer
various parts, but the major manufacturers have been providing open-source code that we can learn from or use outright, like Qualcomm's
CodeAurora Project.
</p><p>
With CM, each device has a &ldquo;maintainer&rdquo;, which is one or more people who
work with that specific device and handle the issues.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Once a handset is rooted, is installing custom ROMs simple, or do
manufacturers try to prevent you from running custom code in other ways?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> It depends on the device. Some are wide
open, and some are &ldquo;rooted&rdquo;
but only in userspace&mdash;nothing can be changed in the boot process so
things like custom kernels can't be used easily.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How does the development process work with so many different
developers and different handsets? Are there any unique frustrations
with working on a project like yours?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> Keeping device-specific changes from breaking things on other
devices is the tricky part. Most of this is handled by device
&ldquo;overlays&rdquo;
that customize the build for the hardware. Android has done a good job
with making most of this relatively easy with its abstraction layers,
but it also evolves rapidly. The extensible parts are where vendors often
add their proprietary code and Android doesn't do anything for backward
compatibility. In CM, we've actually had to re-add support for some of
these older drivers in order to move to newer versions of Android.
</p><p>
There's also the issue of the way Google does development internally. It
releases the source code for new versions after doing all the development
behind the doors, so when it gets into our hands, it takes a lot of
time to figure out what's changed and how to re-integrate our custom
features back into it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Would any of what you do be possible without the GPL requiring
Google to release its source code?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> Android isn't GPL; it's Apache-licensed. The
only code Google's 
required to release is the Linux kernel. But no, without the source code,
the kind of things we are doing wouldn't be possible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What are your most favorite and least favorite hardware devices
to work with? What makes them awesome or horrible?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> The Motorola devices have been the most difficult because of the
huge amount of proprietary code they include, not to mention the signed
bootloader. The Samsung phones also have been a challenge because they've
done a lot of things differently. HTC devices are what we have the best
support for, partially because they are all similar to devices that
Google has worked on directly (G1, Nexus One). The HTC Evo has been my
personal favorite to work on, because the hardware is unique and it was the
first to include things nothing else had like dual cameras and HDMI video.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How much and what kind of experience do
people need to begin
creating their own custom ROM?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> If you want to build CM yourself for a device, we provide detailed
documentation. You just check out the source code and with a few simple
commands, you'll have a flashable ROM. That was the goal&mdash;to ease the
barrier to entry. If you have an idea for a feature, it's very easy to
dive in and start coding.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> I'm not a programmer at all, but I love
CyanogenMod, and I would
like to help. How can someone like me contribute?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> Helping out on our forums, writing documentation and tutorials
on our wiki, and telling everyone you know about it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What makes CyanogenMod different from the other custom ROMs?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> I can't even call it a &ldquo;custom
ROM&rdquo; anymore; it's become more like
an Android distribution. We have a whole infrastructure for submitting
code and a great support network. I want it to be as easy as possible
for people to get involved and add their own ideas. CM is really about
the community. Although we do have a core team of developers, many of the
best parts in CM just came from out of nowhere because somebody thought
it would be a neat idea, and we've made it easy to run the code
on your own device.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Do you plan to expand CyanogenMod to tablet computers as they
become more common?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SK:</b></span> We're already supporting a few tablets like the Nook and Viewsonic
G-Tablet. As more become available and Android 3.0 is released, you can
be sure that we will be trying to make them better.
