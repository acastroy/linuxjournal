Regina Obe and Leo Hsu's <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in Action</em></span> (Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
The hardworking community of developers and users of open-source
geographic information systems (GISes) is sorely underserved, so it's
fortunate to see the new Manning publication <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in
Action</em></span> by Regina
Obe and Leo Hsu. <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in Action</em></span> is the first book devoted entirely to
PostGIS, a freely available open-source spatial database extender, which
can answer questions beyond those possible with a mere relational database.
PostGIS' feature set equals or surpasses proprietary alternatives, allowing
for the creation of location-aware queries and features with just a few
lines of SQL code. Readers with experience in relational databases will
find a background in vector-based GIS that enables quick ramp-up to
analyzing, viewing and mapping data. The advanced will learn how to
optimize queries for maximum speed, simplify geometries for greater
efficiency and create custom functions suited specifically to their
applications.

Opera Dragonfly</h2></div></div><p>
Opera Software's Opera Dragonfly is a new suite of open-source debugging
tools for Web developers and designers that got its name because &ldquo;it
eats bugs&rdquo;. The suite covers the full debugging work flow, from
inspecting network access and downloaded resources to correcting JavaScript
issues and seeing how CSS rules apply to the DOM. Opera Dragonfly supports
all the newest Web technologies, including SVG and HTML5 APIs, such as Web
Storage. Product benefits, sayeth Opera, include a superior JavaScript
debugger, a network inspector to discover why a site &ldquo;turns to
molasses&rdquo; and a storage inspector to uncover how a site handles the
data it collects. Opera Dragonfly loads automatically when one downloads
the Opera browser.

Glenn Rand, Chris Broughton and Amanda
Quintenz-Fiedler's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Capture</em></span> (Rocky Nook)</h2></div></div><p>
The advent of the digital camera
has truly transformed photography and made it more accessible to all,
especially us geeks. Although we geeks might be good at manipulating images
with The GIMP and organizing them with digiKam, we may not be proficient at
the mechanics of good exposure, a requirement that has not changed with
digital photography. Enter the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Capture: Digital Photography
Essentials</em></span>, written by Glenn Rand, Chris Broughton and Amanda
Quintenz-Fiedler. The text addresses both the opportunities and limitations
of digital photography, and how to work with those opportunities and around
the limitations. Readers will learn to maximize the potential of their
images through an understanding of the core principles and more advanced
aspects of the digital photographic process.

Cloud.com's CloudStack</h2></div></div><p>
One of your more direct routes to the cloud is by hopping a ride onto
Cloud.com's CloudStack open-source cloud computing platform, now in version
2.2. CloudStack, says Cloud.com, is a comprehensive, open-source software
solution that accelerates the deployment, management and configuration of
highly scalable, public or private infrastructure as a service clouds.
Data-center operators can build cloud services within their existing
infrastructure to offer on-demand, elastic cloud services. Version 2.2 of
CloudStack offers features such as improved hypervisor support (VMware
vSphere 4, Citrix XenServer 5.6 and KVM), advanced networking
configuration, an AJAX Web interface and borderless scalability. The
federation of managed and hosted availability zones can be managed within a
single CloudStack deployment. The new CloudBridge feature enables
applications to interoperate with other cloud solutions including Amazon
EC2 and S3 APIs, as well as the upcoming OpenStack API. CloudStack is
available for immediate download.

Logicalis Enterprise Power Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Keeping our heads in the clouds, let's take note of another cloud-based
platform, the Logicalis Enterprise Power Cloud for IBM Power 770 Systems.
The solution is for IBM users who require more than Windows and Linux
support. It provides a &ldquo;data center in the sky&rdquo; with all the
capabilities found in on-premises data centers and more. Key benefits
include support for AIX and i5/OS, enterprise-class management skills for
legacy systems, flexible computing capacity, lower infrastructure and
maintenance costs, elasticity to respond to changing business needs, 24x7
monitoring and management, and reduced carbon footprint and energy
consumption.

Libelium Meshlium Xtreme</h2></div></div><p>
Libelium is moving the transparently networked world forward with its newly
released Meshlium Xtreme multiprotocol wireless router&mdash;a global
first according to the company. Meshlium Xtreme uniquely supports five
wireless standards, namely Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GPRS, Bluetooth, GPS and wireline
Ethernet, giving a wide choice of methods for connecting wireless sensor
networks to the Internet. The product also supports the storage of the
sensor data in its internal database system as well as with external
Internet servers. Novel features include dynamic Wi-Fi frequency switching,
a &ldquo;discover and store&rdquo; application for Bluetooth, an aluminum IP67
waterproof enclosure for harsh environments, special holders for attaching
to oddly shaped locations and an optional solar panel kit for locations
without a power source. The management interface is open source, and the
product runs on Debian Linux.

Red Hat's JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The motto for Red Hat's JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform, newly updated to
version 5.1, is &ldquo;turn the data you have into information customers can
use&rdquo;. New in version 5.1 is JBoss Enterprise Data Services Platform 5.1, an
open-source data virtualization and integration platform that includes
tools to create data services out of multiple data stores with different
formats, presenting information to applications and business processes in
an easy-to-use service. JBoss' net benefit, notes Red Hat, is that
&ldquo;data services become reusable assets across the enterprise and value
chain, increasing return on data assets, enabling faster time-to-solution,
and driving better business execution&rdquo;. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform
5.1 includes Apache CXF Web services stack, JBoss Developer Studio 4.0, a
technology preview of WS-BPEL, a technology preview of Apache Camel Gateway
and updated certifications (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Windows 2008, IBM,
JDK and more).
