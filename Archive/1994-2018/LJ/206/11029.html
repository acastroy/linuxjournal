Configure your DNS server to check zone signatures using DNSSEC.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x278e460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I described, in detail, the problem of DNS cache poisoning and
why it's fundamentally changed our understanding of DNS security. Whereas
previously it seemed good enough to keep one's DNS server patched
and limit the hosts for which it performed recursive queries and zone
transfers, we now have no choice but to pay attention to the authenticity
of DNS data that our local resolvers and recursing DNS servers receive
from other servers.
</p><p>
This is because the way DNS recursion works makes it too easy for an
attacker to trigger events that lead directly to that attacker's injecting
forged DNS data into a recursing server's cache, resulting in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
users who rely on that server being redirected to impostor &ldquo;evil
twin&rdquo;
sites for specific e-commerce and on-line banking sites, or malicious,
malware-spreading Web sites and so forth.
</p><p>
I concluded last month by explaining that although the short-term fix to
Kaminsky's cache-poisoning attack is to patch DNS software so that
recursing servers randomize their source UDP ports for DNS queries,
this only makes the attack take longer (albeit, much longer); it
doesn't eliminate it as a threat. The best protection, rather, is for
administrators of authoritative DNS servers to sign all their zone data cryptographically, and for administrators of recursing or caching DNS
servers to configure their servers to check the signatures of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
signed zones they come across.
</p><p>
All of this signing/validating functionality is achieved by way of
DNSSEC, a set of extensions to the DNS protocol. Most modern DNS server
software packages now support DNSSEC (with djbdns as the most notable
exception).
</p><p>
This month, I explain how to configure your recursing/caching
DNS server to check DNS zone data signatures. Because the Internet
Software Consortium's BIND package is by far the most popular DNS
server application for UNIX and UNIX-like systems, my examples all
involve BIND.
</p><p>
If you administer your own DNS zones, you also should sign your own zones
and publish your certificates and signatures, but that's out of scope
for this article. (See Resources for links to other DNSSEC information
and tutorials. I may cover zone signing and DNSSEC key management in
a future column as well.)
</p><p>
Note that my preferred Linux server distribution nowadays is Ubuntu
Server 10.10, so my examples all apply directly to Ubuntu and other
Debian derivatives. If you run some other distribution, my examples
still should be useful, because the only peculiar thing Ubuntu and Debian
do in how they package BIND is to break up its configuration file
(named.conf) into several parts (named.conf.options, named.conf.local
and named.conf.default-zones) that are read into named.conf via
&ldquo;include&rdquo;
statements.

DNSSEC Overview</h2></div></div><p>
Mainly what I want you to get out of this article is how to enable DNSSEC
validation on your BIND-based nameserver. I probably could fill most of
this space with an overview of what DNSSEC is, how it works and so forth,
but in the interest of conciseness, I give the low-attention-span
version instead.
</p><p>
DNSSEC is a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for DNS zone data. When a
zone administrator digitally signs all of the different types of Resource
Records (RRs) in a given zone, and publishes those signatures and the
zone's signing key's public certificate, it then becomes possible for any
recursing nameserver that makes queries against that zone to validate
those signatures and, therefore, to have cryptographic proof that the
answer to a given DNS query hasn't been forged or tampered with.
</p><p>
This probably doesn't sound simple to begin with, but in practice,
it's much more complicated even than that. This is because DNS is both
hierarchical and distributed, with a &ldquo;root&rdquo; zone at the top and individual
hostnames and other Resource Records at the bottom. In between are layers
of zones and subzones.
</p><p>
Consider the top-level domain (TLD) .us as an example. It consists of
more than 50 subzones, each representing a different state or protectorate
in the United States of America&mdash;for example, mn.us for Minnesota,
wi.us for Wisconsin and so forth. Within each &ldquo;state&rdquo; subzone there
can be hundreds of sub-subzones representing cities, counties, state or
municipal government agencies and so forth. lib.mn.us, for example, is
used by public libraries in the state of Minnesota, and stpaul.lib.mn.us
is used by the Saint Paul Public Library system.
</p><p>
Suppose I'm the DNS administrator for mycowtown.lib.mn.us, and I sign
all of the records in that zone and publish the corresponding RRSIG,
DNSKEY and other related records. How praiseworthy of me!
</p><p>
However, if someone tries to resolve names in my domain, for example,
interwebs.mycowtown.lib.mn.us, they'll speak to as many as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span>
other nameservers before they make it all the way down the hierarchy
to my beautiful, signed zone&mdash;that is, the respective authoritative nameservers for &ldquo;.&rdquo; (the root zone), .us, .mn.us and .lib.mn.us. What's to
stop someone from tampering with the answer to one of those
<span   class="emphasis"><em>prior</em></span>,
recursive queries? (Who's authoritative for .us? Who's authoritative
for .mn.us? Who's authoritative for .lib.mn.us?)
</p><p>
Obviously, there has to be a &ldquo;chain of validation&rdquo; all the way from the
zone I really want to validate (mycowtown.lib.mn.us), all the way up
to the root domain. As it happens, &ldquo;.&rdquo; root is signed, and I'll show
you how to download and verify the initial root key shortly. So are
.us and .mn.us. However, .lib.mn.us isn't yet signed (at the time of this
writing). Does that mean it's pointless to sign zones below that?
</p><p>
Not at all. The Internet Software Consortium, creators and maintainers of
BIND, maintain a DNS Look-aside Validation (DLV) database of keys for
zones having precisely this sort of gap in their chains of
validation. If
I sign mycowtown.lib.mn.us and register my key-signing key with
dlv.isc.org, resolving nameservers that are configured to use DLV
still will be able to construct a complete enough chain of validation
by seeing that isc.org vouches for the validity of my key-signing key,
which actually is used to sign the keys (zone-signing keys) with
which I actually sign zone data.
</p><p>
In recent versions of BIND, DNS Look-aside Validation is not only enabled
by default, but preconfigured as well.
</p><p>
There's just one more DNSSEC mechanism I should describe before diving
in to nameserver configuration, and that's automated key management. I
alluded to there being two kinds of DNS keys: key-signing keys (KSKs)
and zone-signing keys (ZSKs). Both types of keys must be regenerated
periodically&mdash;every few months in the case of ZSKs, with which you
actually sign zone data (although in my opinion, the need to do so does
not speak well of how securely PKI is implemented in DNSSEC). Naturally,
every time you change a KSK or ZSK, you must re-sign your entire zone.
</p><p>
Saying that this makes zone-signature management a bit of a headache
is a gross understatement; however, there are various ways to automate
this process. Luckily, right now you and I are concerned only with
validating keys, not maintaining them, and recent versions of BIND 9
have a mechanism for automatically checking and updating a caching nameserver's cache of DNS keys.
</p><p>
This is the managed-keys{} statement in named.conf, which can be used
in lieu of the static trusted-keys{} definition. When you set up BIND
with the root zone's signing key, you'll do so using a managed-keys{}
statement that specifies an &ldquo;initial&rdquo; key that is itself not a KSK or
ZSK, but is used in a transparent, cryptographic transaction in which
your nameserver queries a root zone authority for a copy of its current
public ZSK and caches the answer it receives.
</p><p>
But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. Let's set up a caching
nameserver and then enable DNSSEC validation on it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x278f220"></a>
Setting Up a Caching Server</h2></div></div><p>
If you already have a caching-only nameserver (or a general-purpose
nameserver that also caches), and you need to know only how to set up
DNSSEC validation, you can skip ahead to the Setting Up DNSSEC Validation section
below. In the interest of completeness, however, and for the purpose of
pointing out a few default settings it's good to change, here's a quick
procedure on setting one up.
</p><p>
First, install whatever (sub-)version of BIND9 your distribution
supports. At the time of this writing, Ubuntu 10.10 includes BIND version 9.7.1;
to install it, use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install bind9 bind9utils
</pre>
</p><p>
The bind9 package provides BIND 9.7.1 itself in the form of
the d&aelig;mon named, plus its configuration files, man pages and
libraries. The bind9utils package provides handy commands, such as
rndc and named-checkconf, and the DNSSEC commands dnssec-keygen
and dnssec-signzone. Those last two are used only for creating and
maintaining actual DNSSEC zone keys and signatures, respectively. You
won't actually need those if all you're doing with DNSSEC is validating
signatures from other zones.
</p><p>
On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the bind9 package places its configuration
files in /etc/bind. The files we're concerned with here are
/etc/bind/named.conf, /etc/bind/named.conf.options and
/etc/bind/bind.keys.
</p><p>
Actually, of those three files, we'll edit only one,
named.conf.options. I mention the other two in order to point
out that named.conf uses &ldquo;include&rdquo; statements to pull content from
/etc/bind/named.conf.options, /etc/bind/named.conf.local (which contains
your local zone files) and /etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones (which
contains default zone information for local loopback interfaces).
</p><p>
At this point, I have good news for you: your Debian or Ubuntu system's
named.conf.options file is, technically, already set up to run named as
a caching-only nameserver. The bad news is, it needs to be tightened up
a bit before you can consider it to be a <span   class="emphasis"><em>secure</em></span> caching nameserver.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the default Debian/Ubuntu named.conf.options file (with
comment lines omitted).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x278f698"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Default Ubuntu/Debian named.conf.options File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
options {
	directory "/var/cache/bind";
	auth-nxdomain no;    # conform to RFC1035
	listen-on-v6 { any; };
};
</pre></div><p>
Listing 2, in contrast, is much more secure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x278f900"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. named.conf.local</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
acl mynetworks { 192.168.100.0/24; 10.10.0.0/16; };
options {
        directory "/var/cache/bind";
        allow-query { mynetworks; };
        auth-nxdomain no;    # conform to RFC1035
        listen-on-v6 { none; };
};
</pre></div><p>
Let's discuss why Listing 2 is better. First, I've defined an Access Control
List (ACL) that specifies two IP networks in &ldquo;CIDR notation&rdquo;.
Technically,
this is not an option, but it needs to be loaded before any option
statements, so it needs to go either here or in named.conf prior to
this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.options";
</pre>
</p><p>
In and of itself, this acl doesn't do anything. But once it's defined,
I can create an &ldquo;allow-query&rdquo; option that refers to it, and as you can
see in Listing 2, that's exactly what I've done. Obviously, in adapting this
file for your own use, you should replace the list in my acl statement
(&ldquo;192.168.100.0/24; 10.10.0.0/16;&rdquo;) with a list of your organization's
local IP subnets.
</p><p>
The other security tweak I've made is to change the value for the
&ldquo;listen-on-v6&rdquo; option from &ldquo;any&rdquo; to
&ldquo;none&rdquo;. Because none of my local
subnets use IPv6, there's no reason to listen on any local IPv6
interfaces. Technically, this shouldn't matter if I don't even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span>
any IPv6 interface attached to my server and if I've set an acl and
specified it in an allow-query statement. So, maybe I'm just being
paranoid by turning off IPv6 altogether here, but turning off unused
features is nearly always a good thing to do.
</p><p>
Once you've edited and saved your /etc/bind/named.conf.options file,
you can check your work by running the <tt  >named-checkconf</tt> command with
no arguments, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo named-checkconf
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming that doesn't return any configuration errors (I have a tendency
to misplace or omit semicolons, myself), you then can make your running
named process reload its configuration and zone files using the rndc
command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo rndc reload
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can test your server by logging on to some other host on your
network and running a <tt  >dig</tt> query or two against it. For example, if
my caching nameserver's IP address is 192.168.100.253, I can have it
look up DNS information for www.linuxjournal.com like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mick@someotherhost:/home/mick$ dig @192.168.100.253 
 &#8618;www.linuxjournal.com
</pre>
</p><p>
You can, of course, simply configure your client system to use your
caching nameserver as its default nameserver, in which case you can
omit the <tt  >@192.168.100.253</tt> in the above command. But, you probably don't
want to do that until you're sure it <span   class="emphasis"><em>works</em></span>.
</p><p>
If it doesn't work, make sure your client system's IP address falls
into one of the IP networks you specified in any acls you've set in
/etc/bind/named.conf.options, as I described earlier.
</p><p>
At this point, your caching-only nameserver is up and working
properly. Now you can configure DNSSEC validation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x2b885a0"></a>
Setting Up DNSSEC Validation</h2></div></div><p>
Back on your caching nameserver, all you need to do to add DNSSEC
validation is add three lines in the options{} section of your
/etc/bind/named.conf.options file, plus a new managed-keys{} section,
as shown in Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x2b886a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

        LmqrAmRLKBP1dfwhYB4N7knNnulqQxA+Uk1ihz0= ";
};
</pre></div><p>
The first two new lines in Listing 3, <tt  >dnssec-enable yes;</tt> and
<tt  >dnssec-validation yes;</tt>, enable DNSSEC on your caching nameserver. This
is actually a redundant setting, because &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is the default value for
both these settings in BIND versions 9.5 and later, but it doesn't hurt
to specify them.
</p><p>
The third new line, <tt  >dnssec-lookaside auto;</tt>, tells BIND/named to
use DLV automatically any time it can't
validate a complete chain of trust from a given Resource Record all the
way from root (.) downward. See the DNSSEC Overview section earlier in this
article if you've forgotten how DLV works.
</p><p>
As I mentioned in that section, recent versions of BIND are preconfigured
to find isc.org's DLV repositories. All you have to do to take advantage
of this is set &ldquo;dnssec-lookaside&rdquo; to &ldquo;auto&rdquo;, and BIND will do the rest. As
more and more TLDs are signed, this feature will become less important.
</p><p>
And, that brings me to the last new element in the named.conf.options
file: the managed-keys{} section. This specifies a key for the DNS
&ldquo;root&rdquo;
domain, which is the top of any chain of DNSSEC trust.
</p><p>
You don't necessarily need to specify any keys &ldquo;lower&rdquo; in the DNS hierarchy
than root; if you start out knowing the root key, you can trust signed
replies from root nameservers. That trust flows downward to signed
data from TLDs (.gov, .us, .net and so on) and so forth. &ldquo;Gaps&rdquo;
in the downward chain of validation hopefully will be handled by DLV.
</p><p>
For heaven's sake, do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> simply copy Listing 3's key
entry for &ldquo;.&rdquo; verbatim! Tony Finch has written a quick-and-easy
procedure on checking and validating the (initial) root certificate
(see Resources). Summarized, this procedure consists of the following steps.
</p><p>
1) Use the following <tt  >dig</tt> command to obtain the current root certificate and save it to the file root-dnskey:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ dig +multi +noall +answer DNSKEY . &gt;root-dnskey
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Create a hash of this certificate and save it to the file root-ds
with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ $ dnssec-dsfromkey -f root-dnskey . &gt;root-ds
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Pull the official root certificate's hash from
<a href="https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml" target="_self">https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml</a>, and compare it to the
root-ds file you just created. For extra paranoia, you can use PGP to
check the signature of root-anchors.xml (see Tony Finch's article).
</p><p>
4) If the hashes match, copy the key (the long one, number 257) from
root-dnskey into your managed-keys statement, as shown in Listing 3. The
first line of this block (after the <tt  >managed-keys {</tt> line) should be
the same as in Listing 3.
</p><p>
As with your previous changes, after you save named.conf.options, you
should check it with <tt  >named-checkconf</tt>, and then load it with <tt  >rndc
reload</tt>.
</p><p>
Finally, to test DNSSEC validation, test some known-signed record, such as
www.isc.org, using dig. Be sure to use the <tt  >+dnssec</tt> flag, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mick@someotherhost:/home/mick$ dig @192.168.100.253 
 &#8618;www.isc.org +dnssec
</pre>
</p><p>
If everything is working, dig's output should indicate that the &ldquo;ad&rdquo;
(authenticated data) flag is set. Listing 4 shows the first part of
what a successful reply to our example dig command would look like.
Note the line that begins <tt  >;; flags: qr rd ra ad;</tt>.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And with that, your nameserver is successfully validating signed zone
data! For now, I wish you thanks and goodbye. As I seem to
do every couple years, I'm going to take a hiatus for a few months. I
do plan on resuming the Paranoid Penguin after that, however, refreshed
and renewed for your reading pleasure.
</p><p>
Until then, take care of yourself and especially your Linux systems!
