The new second edition of Dave Taylor and Brandon Perry's classic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell
Scripts</em></span> features a smorgasbord of classic favorite scripts and 23 brand-new ones.

and Perry's guide
features a collection of useful, customizable and fun shell scripts for solving common
problems and personalizing one's computing environment. Each chapter contains
ready-to-use scripts and explanations of how they work, why one would use them and
suggestions for changing and expanding them. Highlights of these not just useful but
also wicked cool scripts include a disk backup utility that keeps files safe from a
system crash, a password manager, a weather tracker, several games, a ZIP code lookup
tool, a Bitcoin address information retriever, as well as tools for cloud services,

USMobile, Inc.'s Scrambl3</h2></div></div><p>
The special sauce in USMobile, Inc.'s Scrambl3, the mobile app that facilitates
&ldquo;the world's most private calls and messages&rdquo;, is a set of open-source
components that create a top-secret-grade VPN, encryption algorithms and internet
protocols. USMobile says that, for myriad reasons, Scrambl3 stands head and shoulders
above WhatsApp and Viber for security and privacy. For instance, new Scrambl3 Android
and iOS users are asked to provide only a user name and password sans verification of a
cell-phone number, access to private cell-phone contacts and email addresses, all of which
is &ldquo;a hassle and a violation of your personal privacy&rdquo;. Scrambl3 provides many
advantages since it does not rely on a cell-phone number. For example, Scrambl3 can be
used on Wi-Fi-connected tablets, and attackers cannot listen in on user calls and texts by
exploiting the public telephone system's SS7 security flaw. Finally, Scrambl3 users
privately exchange their user names and add them to their respective Scrambl3 Black Book
contact listing, making unwanted calls or messages impossible on users' private
networks.

Permabit Technology Corporation's Albireo VDO for Ubuntu Server</h2></div></div><p>
In perfect alignment with its self-described identity as &ldquo;the data reduction
expert&rdquo;, Permabit Technology Corporation recently announced availability of its
Albireo Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO) 6 for Canonical's Ubuntu Server. VDO data
reduction enables enterprise hybrid cloud data centers and cloud service providers to
reduce their storage footprint, increase data density and avoid costly data-center
expansions, resulting in &ldquo;massive savings on data-center investment&rdquo;. Permabit
says its move to Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS&mdash;and imminently 16.04 LTS, as well&mdash;is the
only modular data reduction solution available for the Linux block storage stack. The
move occurred due to Ubuntu's place in the forefront of large cloud infrastructure
deployments and its deep involvement in the OpenStack project. VDO leverages
Permabit's patented deduplication, HIOPS Compression and thin provisioning
technologies.

CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
Although open-source software excels at innovation and leverages the immense power of
talented developers dedicated to solving difficult problems, the focus is rarely on
enterprise capabilities, asserts CloudBees, the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps.
Fortunate for Jenkins developers, CloudBees, Inc., has announced CloudBees Jenkins
Enterprise, a Jenkins distribution aimed directly at enterprises that &ldquo;ensures the
highest levels of testing and verification, providing smooth upgrades and the most
reliable and stable Jenkins foundation for software development and DevOps
teams&rdquo;.
This enterprise distribution of Jenkins is possible due to CloudBees' new
comprehensive testing and verification process called the CloudBees Assurance Program.
Consisting of a trio of engineering, QA and machine resources, the program is dedicated
to verifying the stability, security, inter-compatibility and upgradability of the
Jenkins' core along with the curated set of the most popular third-party
open-source Jenkins extensions that round out the distribution. As DevOps needs rapidly
evolve, enterprises require confidence that they are implementing the most
feature-rich, reliable and secure Jenkins-based continuous delivery platform possible,
which they now have at their disposal.

Jetico's BestCrypt Container Encryption for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
For users in search of a commercially supported encryption tool for Linux with a
backdoor-free guarantee, Jetico recommends its recently updated BestCrypt Container
Encryption for Linux 3.0. Jetico's BestCrypt Container Encryption automatically
encrypts any selected files
or folders on an active computer, shared workstation or network storage in Linux,
Windows and Mac OS environments so that nobody can gain access without the right password
or keys. Jetico says that BestCrypt is easy to install, easy to use and totally
transparent&mdash;meaning it actually gets used. The new version 3.0 of BestCrypt features
keyfile support, one-click installation and access to binary packages for popular Linux
distributions and a graphics and usability makeover. Jetico adds that while drive or
disk encryption safeguards from physical threats, like lost or stolen devices, it fails
to protect online storage or computers connected to the internet. Jetico's
BestCrypt ensures that encrypted files stored in the cloud can be accessed on Linux.

Applied Expert Systems, Inc.'s CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most important characteristics of the contemporary data center, notes
Applied Expert Systems, Inc. (AES), is that an ever-increasing amount of the traffic is
between servers. Realizing the resulting need to facilitate improved server-to-server
communications, AES developed CleverView for TCP/IP on Linux v2.5 with KVM Monitoring.
CleverView gives IT staff access to current and historical server performance and
availability details from not only their browser desktops but also their cell phones
via the CLEVER Mobile for Linux app. The highlight of this version 2.5 is the new
ability to monitor KVM guest support providing clear and concise information on
availability and performance. KVMView shows CPU count, memory used, max memory and CPU
used with the ability to drill down into the TCP/IP statistics for the selected KVM
Guest. The new enterprise-wide metrics provide a crisp, clear and concise view
allowing trend, pattern and anomaly identification. Reports provide for more effective
decision-making to meet today's dynamic anywhere-anytime service demand.
