Docker containers are great, but Docker hosts and instances still need
to be managed. Configuration management tools like Puppet can work
hand in hand with Docker, and their powerful domain-specific languages
(DSLs) make light work of things that are tricky or impossible to do in
Docker itself.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeb2580.0xfaa250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
DevOps and containerization are currently all the rage in agile IT
shops. However, there are valid differences of opinion about the
appropriate demarcation between containerization and configuration
management technologies in a well designed DevOps toolchain. Both
technologies have specific use cases, although there is also a great
deal of overlap between them. In many cases, the technologies complement
one another and are intended to work together. This article focuses
on building synergy between Docker and Puppet, and shows how the two
technologies can work together to provide a more robust DevOps
environment than either tool can manage alone.
</p><p>
One way of looking at Docker is as a modern take on the IT practice of
deploying &ldquo;golden images&rdquo; onto a server. In the simplest cases, Docker
images bundle up a service and its runtime dependencies into an
easily deployable, self-contained unit. A static image is a great
solution for reliably deploying services to the data center, but on the
other hand, the lack of configurability can lead to needlessly bloated
service catalogs as new images are built for each different hard-coded
configuration.
</p><p>
Docker supports a limited number of features for enabling configuration
changes at build time and runtime, but actively maintaining complex
configurations is not what Docker is designed to do. You certainly
can tweak Docker images with environment variables, command-line options,
layered images, Docker volumes with configuration data or custom
scripting, but all of those options come at the cost of additional
complexity. Without a robust domain-specific language and ongoing
convergence to a defined state, using Docker features to support dynamic
configurations often leads to the very problems that dedicated
configuration management tools like Puppet were designed to solve.
</p><p>
Why focus on just Docker and Puppet, when there are other tools in that
space? Although there certainly are alternatives, when one thinks of
containerization, Docker is far and away the current mindshare leader.
The race is a little tighter in the configuration management space, but
Puppet is definitely a strong enterprise-class solution that has been
widely deployed for more than a decade. I focus on Docker and
Puppet for the remainder of this article in order to avoid gross
generalizations that may not apply equally to every containerization or
configuration management tool currently available.

Use Cases for Integrating Docker and Puppet</h2></div></div><p>
If you're deploying services into a Docker-based infrastructure, why add
Puppet to the toolchain? After all, one of the most common uses of
Docker is to deploy preconfigured services out to the cloud. If the
services are preconfigured, how would using a configuration management
tool like Puppet improve the process?
</p><p>
There are three core use cases to consider. The first is using Puppet to
provision the Docker service on a host, so that it is available to
manage Docker instances. The second is provisioning specific Docker
instances, such as a containerized web service, onto a managed host. The
third is managing complex or dynamic configurations inside Docker
containers using Puppet agents baked in to the Docker image. In this
article, I address only the first use case, but I plan to address the others in
future articles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeb2580.0xfaa670"></a>
Provisioning Docker with Puppet</h2></div></div><p>
Docker is a great tool, but it isn't installed by default on most Linux
distributions. When your cloud or data center has tens of thousands of
nodes running Linux, how do you install the Docker d&aelig;mon on only the
nodes that need it?
</p><p>
In a homogeneous server farm, you might use a template or image that
already has Docker on it, and whatever process spins up the node will
ensure that Docker is available for running containers. However, in a
more heterogeneous environment, only <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> of the nodes will be hosting
Docker containers, and without a configuration management system, you
can't easily add or remove Docker from existing hosts in a
well controlled, automated way. Managing packages, files and services
on existing nodes is what Puppet was made for!
</p><p>
Imagine that you have an Ubuntu server with no special
characteristics or running services other than SSH. As a best practice,
this server already should have the Puppet agent installed in order to
avoid yet another bootstrap problem, but as long as you already have a
Puppet master in your environment, placing this new node under
configuration management is easy.
</p><p>
The specifics of doing this may vary slightly by Linux distribution,
Puppet version and whether you are using Puppet open source or
Puppet Enterprise. Although the commands may vary, the steps will be very
similar.
</p><p>
First, you'll configure some basic items on the server. Second, you'll
install the Puppet agent, register the client with the server and kick
off the provisioning process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeb2580.0xfaa930"></a>
Server-Side Settings</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Automating Which Nodes Get Docker Installed</b></span>
</p><p>
At scale, it can be very helpful to apply certain
configurations automatically to nodes based on the node's hostname. To see this in
action, create a Puppet environment named &ldquo;example&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mkdir -p \
    /etc/puppet/code/environments/example/manifests

sudo touch \
    /etc/puppet/code/environments/example/manifests/site.pp
</pre>
</p><p>
And, assign the
<tt  >docker</tt> class to any Puppet client that has &ldquo;docker&rdquo;
in its hostname:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/puppet/code/environments/example/manifests/site.pp

# Use a regular expression to assign the docker
# class to any node that contains "docker" in its
# hostname.
node /docker/ {
  include docker
}
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Autosigning Client Certificates</b></span>
</p><p>
By default, Puppet operates in client/server mode and uses SSL
certificates on both the client and server sides for authentication as
well as transport security. If your Puppet master is not on the same
machine as the client, you can make your life easier (but a little less
secure) by allowing Puppet to sign client certificates
from whitelisted hosts automatically. For example, depending on your naming
conventions for subdomains and hostnames, one or more of the following
entries could be adapted to whitelist Docker nodes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/puppet/autosign.conf

docker-host-001.example.com
*.docker-hosts.localdomain
*.local
</pre>
</p><p>
Autosigning client certificates reduces security in exchange for a
dramatic boost in convenience and productivity. Within a secure network,
this often is worth the modest risk. However, you also can configure
more secure policy-based autosigning with Puppet, but doing so is well
outside the scope of this article.
</p><p>
In the short term, if you prefer not to use autosigning, you can pass
the <tt  >--waitforcert</tt> flag to the Puppet agent and then manually approve
unsigned client certificates on the Puppet master while the clients
wait. For small numbers of servers, the manual nature of this process is
offset by the fact that it has to be done only once per client. However,
as a process, it simply scales poorly. Policy-based autosigning is
definitely the right way to go for the security-conscious enterprise.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Defining a Docker Manifest</b></span>
</p><p>
Now Puppet is ready to do its real job: using a declarative
domain-specific language to place each node into a known state. Create
the following manifest for Ubuntu to tell your designated Docker nodes how to
install and start the Docker service:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/puppet/code/environments/example/manifests/docker.pp

class docker {
  package { 'docker':
    name   =&gt; 'docker.io',
    ensure =&gt; present,
  } -&gt;
  service { 'docker':
    ensure =&gt; running,
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that on recent Ubuntu versions, the Docker package was renamed
docker.io to avoid conflicts with an unrelated package that is also
named docker, but the service script and process name are still
docker. This is potentially confusing, but the Puppet manifest above
handles this situation with ease. The manifest should be tweaked for
other distributions or replaced with a suitable module from the Puppet
Forge that selects the appropriate package name based on the client's
distribution and OS version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeb2580.0xfab170"></a>
Client-Side Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Remember, you're managing the Puppet agent manually here because it's not
yet part of your default OS installation. Once you have a configured
Puppet master, and the Puppet agent is baked in to your default OS
installation process, the client installation (and in many cases the
certificate management process) will be automatic.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installing the Puppet Agent</b></span>
</p><p>
You've configured the basic elements of the Puppet server to support
Docker. Now you need to configure the client. First, install the Puppet
agent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install puppet-agent
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you have to assign the agent to a Puppet environment. By default,
all Puppet agents are assigned to <span   class="emphasis"><em>production</em></span>, but it's a best practice
to perform these sorts of experiments within a dedicated environment
that won't impact your real production systems. There are ways to set
the client's environment server-side, but they are out of scope for this
exercise. Instead, you'll use the agent's configuration file and
command-line options to ensure that you're using manifests defined for a
dedicated, non-production environment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# This command will configure the correct agent
# environment.
sed -i '$a\\n[agent]\nenvironment = example' \
    /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

</pre>
</p><p>
If the command above worked properly, the puppet.conf file should now
look similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
ssldir = /var/lib/puppet/ssl

[master]
vardir = /var/lib/puppet
cadir  = /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca
dns_alt_names = puppet

[agent]
environment = example
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the Puppet agent is installed, and assuming the existence of a
Puppet master named <tt  >puppet</tt> that has been configured to autosign client
certificates, this system will install Docker on new nodes automagically
any time the hostname matches the regular expression defined in the
site.pp node list. Simply ensure that each node that should run Docker
contains &ldquo;docker&rdquo; in its hostname and you're done!
</p><p>
However, it's often wise to kick off the first agent run manually,
especially so that you can spot any problems with server
connectivity or SSL certificates quickly. You already defined a Puppet
environment named &ldquo;example&rdquo;, and the agent will attempt to contact a
server named &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; unless directed otherwise by puppet.conf or on the
command line. The following commands show how to define both
the server and the environment explicitly, and it will override any configuration file
settings or defaults if necessary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Running agent with puppet.conf and/or default
# values.
sudo puppet agent --test

# Overriding the server and environment values.
sudo puppet agent \
    --test \
    --server ubuntu-yakkety.localdomain \
    --environment example
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the Puppet agent has completed its run, you quickly can validate
that the Docker service is running properly&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Show verbose status of the Docker service.
$ sudo service docker status

# Count of running Docker processes.
$ pgrep -c docker
1
</pre>

Putting It All in Context</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you may be thinking that all this Puppet stuff seems like
a lot more work than simply running <tt  >apt-get -y install docker.io</tt> on
each new Linux machine in your data center. In the short term, using
Puppet to install Docker certainly requires more work up front. However,
this will really pay off in the long term when you have large numbers of
nodes to manage and you're attempting to provision them in a
fully automated way. In addition, don't overlook the value of how easily
Puppet can automate critical patches related to Docker, or the assurance
that Puppet will enforce (and report any changes to) the expected status
of the Docker service every time the Puppet agent runs.
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll expand on Docker/Puppet integration
further to install, start or stop Docker containers across the data
center based on centrally managed roles and profiles. If you aren't
already convinced that Docker and Puppet make a powerful one-two
combination, you won't want to miss the next installment.
