Dave continues to build a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span> game, and in
this installment, he deals
with runners and counting up how many brains you've harvested
while trying to avoid those pesky gunshots.

For the record, this is my 100th column for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. One hundred
columns. That's more than eight years of me writing about shell scripts and
you, dear reader, reading my articles. It seems like a good partnership, and I hope
we can stick together into the next decade, which is only a dozen or two
columns down the road. That first column was titled &ldquo;Getting
Started with Redirection&rdquo;, and it explored the differences between &gt;,
&gt;&gt;, &lt; and &lt;&lt; in shell scripts. I think we've come a long way since then!
</p><p>
And on this occasion of commemorating my 100th column, I again
invite you to send me e-mail with your ideas for interesting column topics. If
you can dream it up, and it's not insanely complicated, you can write it
as a shell script. Enough of that mushy stuff though&mdash;let's get back
to work!
</p><p>
In my last article, I started writing a game that simulated some elements of the
Jackson Games dice game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span>. As homework,
you might want to pick up the game at Target or Walmart next time you're
there, or get it at <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_self">amazon.com</a>. It's fun, easy and great with
kids (or with my kids, at least, who can appreciate a few zombies as
a source of entertainment). 
</p><p>
The game revolves around rolling dice and
seeking to maximize one accumulation of items (brains) while avoiding
getting shot at too many times (gunshots). There are three different
kinds of dice with varying levels of challenges&mdash;green, yellow and
red&mdash;and various nuances about how many you can roll and how. To learn more,
check out last month's column or look at the instructions that came with
your canister of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie Dice</em></span>.
</p><p>
The script, when last I hacked it, could simulate a roll while also
randomly choosing between the different dice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./zdice.sh
    rolled green die: brain
    rolled red die: runner
    rolled red die: brain
</pre>
</p><p>
To start, let's add the smarts in the script to know what a
&ldquo;runner&rdquo;
is. &ldquo;Dude, what is a runner?&rdquo; I can hear you ask. Okay, okay,
a runner is essentially an ambiguous roll, and if you opt to roll your
dice again, you roll that specific die, whether it's green, yellow or
red. The brains and gunshots you pull aside and accumulate, by contrast.
So on the above roll, you'd put the two brain dice aside, re-roll the
red &ldquo;runner&rdquo; and randomly pick two of the remaining dice to make
the three required for another roll. In code, you can simulate this by
assigning specific values to the <tt  >diceroll[]</tt> array. If the specific roll
status is set to zero, it's a new roll of a new die. If not, it's
the numeric value associated with the die color and produces a re-roll:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ${diceroll[$rollcount]} -eq 0 ] ; then
  pick_color
else
  echo "  dice $rollcount was a runner last time, \
      rerolling the same color die again:"
  color=${diceroll[$rollcount]}
  diceroll[$rollcount]=0      # reset for next roll
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The entire purpose of this segment is to set the
&ldquo;color&rdquo;
variable correctly. Who knew that'd require so much code?
</p><p>
So that you have some status output though, it's the kind of information
that might well be removed once you've thoroughly tested the production
code. You'll then have this snippet:

    
<pre     class="programlisting">
roll_die $color
echo "    rolled ${colorname[$color]} die: ${nameof[$roll]}"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is an example of debug output. I've written about debugging shell
scripts in previous columns if you want to check the archives to learn
more about this essential element of script development.
</p><p>
There's not much work in the <tt  >add_score</tt> subroutine, as you'll see shortly,
but it fits in here, after the dice rolls. Then there's additional
code below to show how you're doing with this roll, and this will be where
the challenge of accumulating brains and gunshot scores will happen,
along with the test of whether you've had too many gunshots and have lost.
</p><p>
One more step, the mirror of the earlier code: if the roll (variable
<tt  >$roll</tt>, set in subroutine
<tt  >roll_die</tt>) is a runner, then the
<tt  >diceroll[]</tt>
value needs to be set appropriately so it can be differentiated from a
non-runner roll:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $roll -eq $RUNNER ] ; then
  diceroll[$rollcount]=$color;
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
This is all neatly wrapped up in a for loop that gives three rolls
with the simple expedient of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for roll count in 1 2 3
do
   all the code shown above goes here
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's have a closer look at the <tt  >add_score</tt> subroutine, then the loop
that lets you decide after each three-dice roll whether you want to stop
or continue. Remember, your goal is to get the most brains without dying
of three gunshot wounds:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function add_score
{
  # Add the current roll to the score so far
  # Only need to score brains and gunshots

  case $roll in
    $BRAIN ) brains=$(( $brains + 1 ))  ;;
    $SHOT  )  shots=$(( $shots + 1 ))  ;;
  esac
}
</pre>
</p><p>
It's short and sweet, actually. Notice that as with many case statements,
there actually are three possible values (<tt  >$RUNNER</tt> is the third possible
value), but only two are addressed. That's fine; the third value just
drops through. The trick with good coding, of course, is to know that's
going to happen.
</p><p>
If you haven't seen it before, the <tt  >$(( ))</tt> notation is a convenience
for invoking an equation-solving part of the Bash shell. It's similar
to <tt  >$( expr $shots + 1 )</tt>, but it executes faster because it doesn't require
instantiation of a subshell.
</p><p>
From a functional perspective, <tt  >add_score</tt> shouldn't test to see if you have
accumulated the 13 brains needed to win or have been hit three or more times
with gunshots&mdash;a lose scenario. Those show up a bit later in the script
instead, just below the runner-savvy dice-rolling code shown earlier.
</p><p>
The code now invokes the routine, shown in my last article, that displays your
current score:

<pre     class="programlisting">
show_score
</pre>
</p><p>
Now for the big question: did you accumulate three or more gunshots? If you
did, <tt  >show_score</tt> will have returned a non-zero status, which can then
be tested:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
   echo "BOOM. You died. But you did get to roll \
       $totalrolls times and eat $brains brains."
   exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
If you survive that test, you're still alive! Hurray.
</p><p>
And that's where I'm going to stop for this month. Next month,
I'll explore the rest of the brains/gunshots testing rules and have
a functional one-player game. But that's not much fun, so I'll
delve into creating a computer player too, suggesting some algorithmic
strategies that should make it a decent player.
