Tails above the Rest, Part II
</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Kyle Rankin</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #240, April 2014</div></div><div><p>
Now that you have Tails installed, let's start using it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2996580.0x2a8e3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm halfway through what will likely be a three-part series on the Tails
live disk. In the first column, I introduced Tails as a special distribution of
Linux, based on Debian, that puts all sorts of privacy- and security-enhancing
tools in a live disk you can boot anywhere. Then I talked about how to
download and install the distribution securely on a CD or USB disk. In this
article, I'm going to follow up with a general overview of the Tails desktop and
highlight some of the software you are most likely to use within it. In
my next column, I'll cover some of the more advanced features of Tails,
including the persistent disk and encryption.

Tails Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
Before I talk too much about the security features of Tails, I think it's
important to highlight the limitations that Tails has. Although Tails is
incredibly useful and makes it much easier to use the Internet securely, it
still isn't a magical solution that will solve all of your privacy problems.
Before you use Tails, it's important to know where its limitations are and
beyond that, mistakes that you might make that could remove some of the
protections Tails does have.
</p><p>
Tails uses Tor to anonymize your Internet use, but that within itself has
limitations. First, Tails doesn't attempt to hide the fact that you are using
Tor or Tails, so if others can sniff the traffic leaving your network, while
they may not be able to tell what Web sites you are browsing, they still
can tell you are using Tor itself. So, if you are in a situation where you may get
into trouble for using Tor, Tails out of the box won't protect you. Second,
although traffic between you and Tor and between Tor nodes is encrypted, traffic
that leaves Tor is not necessarily encrypted. Tails, like the Tor browser
bundle, adds extensions to its Web browser to attempt to use HTTPS-encrypted
sites whenever possible, but if you send an unencrypted e-mail or browse to an
unencrypted Web site, the traffic leaving Tor still would be unencrypted.
Along the same lines, you also still may be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks launched from a malicious Tor exit node itself or from an attacker
between the Tor exit node and the site you want to visit, so you still
need to pay attention to any certificate warnings you see in your browser.
</p><p>
Generally speaking, Tails doesn't scrub your Internet traffic or any documents
you create for any identifying metadata. If you decide to log in to a
social-networking site from inside Tails and then browse to other sites that integrate
with that login, even though those sites will see that the traffic came from a
Tor exit node and not from your personal computer, cookies and other
identifying metadata from the social-networking site will out you. Generally
speaking, you don't want to do anything within a single browsing session in
Tails that may link on-line identities (like an e-mail account,
social-networking login and the like) that you don't want linked. Likewise, if you
write a document or edit a photo within Tails, it won't automatically remove
any metadata that contains identifying information.

The Tails Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Before you get to the Tails desktop itself, you are greeted with a login
prompt (Figure 1) that asks if you'd like more options. These additional
options allow you to use persistent volumes, set administrator passwords and
go into incognito Windows mode. But, I'll cover more advanced features in a
follow-up column, so in the meantime, just click Login.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11659f1.large.jpg"><img src="11659f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Tails Pre-Desktop Prompt
</p></div></div><p>
Tails uses the all-too-familiar GNOME 2 desktop (Figure 2) with a panel along
the top containing Applications, Places and System menus; a few icons for
application shortcuts; and a notification area to the far right that lists the
time along with icons, so you can see the status of the network, Tor, your
battery (if you are on a laptop), a PGP applet and even an on-screen keyboard
you can use to enter passwords if you suspect your computer might have a
keylogger installed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11659f2.large.jpg"><img src="11659f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Default Tails Desktop
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2996580.0x2a8ec48"></a>
Tor and the Iceweasel Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
The Tor Vidalia front-end application shows up in the notification area as an
onion icon. The moment that Tails connects to a network, it will attempt to
start up Tor, and this icon will change from yellow to green once Tor is fully
up and configured. You can double-click the icon to open the Vidalia control
panel to reset your Tor connection or view the current network. Once Tor is
ready, Tails also will launch a Web browser configured much like the one in
the Tor browser bundle with privacy-enhancing settings and plugins like
NoScript (disables JavaScript), HTTPS-anywhere (attempts to connect to the
HTTPS version of a Web page by default) as well as plugins so the browser uses
Tor.
</p><p>
Like with the Tor Browser Bundle, all the sites you browse in the default browser
go over the Tor network. The browser also uses search engines like Start Page
in the default search bar. Start Page returns Google results but acts as a
proxy to help anonymize your search queries. Don't be surprised if you
sometimes get Web pages localized in a foreign language&mdash;Tor may route you
over an exit node in a different country, and often sites try to be helpful and
set the default language based on where they think you are from. If
for some reason you need to use a Web browser outside Tor (for instance, so
you can authenticate to an active portal on hotel Wi-Fi), there also is an
unsafe browser option you can launch that bypasses Tor. Just be sure to close
the browser once you are done so you don't mistakenly use it when you intend
to browse over Tor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2996580.0x2a8eda8"></a>
Pidgin</h2></div></div><p>
Beyond browsing, instant messaging is another communication tool that could
benefit from some privacy. Tails includes the Pidgin instant-messaging client
and by default enables only the communication plugins for IRC and XMPP, as they
are considered to have a decent security track record with respect to fixing
security bugs. Each time you start Tails, it creates a random
English-sounding user name for Pidgin to help aid in your anonymity. In
addition, it includes the OTR (Off the Record) plugin that helps you have
private IM conversations by not only encrypting the communication end to end,
but it also authenticates the person you are chatting with, has forward secrecy,
and even adds a deniability element to make it difficult outside the
conversation to prove who said what (there's more information about how OTR achieves
this at <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr" target="_self">www.cypherpunks.ca/otr</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2996580.0x2a8ef60"></a>
Other Applications</h2></div></div><p>
I'll cover e-mail in more depth in a follow-up column where I discuss
encryption, but Tails includes the Claws mail client that you can use to
access any personal e-mail accounts. Of course, it's worth saying that if you do
access a personal e-mail account without using SSL encryption, even over the
Tor network, someone who is sniffing the traffic coming from that Tor exit
node, or sniffing traffic coming into your e-mail provider, will be able to
correlate your account with that particular Tor session.
</p><p>
Beyond e-mail, Tails
also includes the OpenOffice.org productivity suite, so you can work on
documents and spreadsheets, the GIMP for image editing, and Audacity so you
can listen to and edit audio files. Many people could very well spend their
entire day within Tails and get work done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2996580.0x2a8f118"></a>
Shutdown</h2></div></div><p>
Once you are done with Tails, you can log out and select to reboot or shut down
the computer. In either case, since anything that might identify you 
resides only in RAM, Tails makes a point to wipe the contents of RAM before it
completely shuts down. I've noticed on my computers that this results in
strange artifacts showing up on the screen during that process, but once it's
done, Tails will shut down safely, and you can remove the DVD or USB drive.
</p><p>
This covers just some of the basic usage of Tails, but in my next column, I'll cover
some of the more advanced uses, including persistent disks, encryption and
some of the other internal Tails tools that are dense enough topics that they
deserve their own treatment. In the meantime, enjoy your safe and private
Internet browsing.
