We often brag about how few resources Linux needs to operate: a Raspberry
Pi or Beagle Board, in a Web browser (<a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux" target="_self">bellard.org/jslinux</a>), or any
number of other tiny places. Just because our beloved OS can run on a tiny
scrap of hardware, however, certainly doesn't mean that's all it will do!
In this issue, we talk about high-performance computing. Whether you're
calculating trajectory corrections for a spacecraft millions of miles away
or hashing transactions for the Bitcoin network, Linux is the
perfect vehicle for all that computing power.

Reuven M. Lerner starts us out this month, this time with information on how
to leverage geolocation information in your Web application. 
Whether you want to give your Web visitors a local weather forecast or 
just want to present them with location-appropriate options from your Web
applications, geolocation is a powerful tool. Since the Internet is global,
it's important to know where users are located. Reuven shows how to
integrate geolocation awareness into your Web applications.
Dave Taylor follows with the next in his series on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie
Dice</em></span>.
It may feel like you're just making a cool game, but it's really just a ruse
to help you learn something. (Well, it's a cool game too, but you really are
learning!)

Kyle Rankin continues his series on Tails. When it comes to 
browsing the Web securely, you either can wear a tinfoil hat or look into something
like Tails. The former won't help with security, but people at the coffee
shop probably will leave you alone. Last month, Kyle explained how to
install Tails, and this
month, he describes using it. I took a completely different look at Linux this
month. Instead of discussing security, I talk about
entertainment-ivity. I recently set up my XBMC devices to share a
centralized MySQL database, and I found it a little more difficult than I
expected. In my column, I walk you through the process, and also discuss my
mobile entertainment system: Plex. I get lots of e-mail regarding my home
media setup, so this month I tell all.
</p><p>
Then we get into the nitty gritty of this month's issue. David Brown gives
some great processes for managing HPC clusters. High-performance
computing usually means lots of computers, and managing those clusters can
be overwhelming! David walks through a phased process to deal with
rolling out an HPC environment. Adam Diaz follows with a great article on
YARN. No, he's not teaching how to knit, but rather a new method to deal
with resource management in Hadoop. Rather than continuing to stretch
MapReduce beyond its abilities, YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
attempts to take over the resource management features of MapReduce.
If
you're a Hadoop user, you need to read about YARN.
</p><p>
Linux containers continue to be the rage as the more efficient method for
virtualization allows for far more dense computing. High-performance
computing gets far more performance out of containers than out of
traditional virtualized hardware. Rami Rosen discusses Linux containers
and how the combination of lightweight virtualization and HPC will shape
the future of cloud computing. And finally, Brian Trapp shows how to use
MySQL's built in replication to help secure data integrity in your database
implementations. My mantra is always &ldquo;backup, backup, backup&rdquo;, but with the
fast pace data changes in a database system, frequent backups aren't
enough. With data replication, backups are still important, but the
database administrator can sleep a little better between backup cycles.

This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has tons of HPC information, but if that's not
your cup of penguin juice (eiw!), there's plenty of tech tips, product
announcements and general Linux information to keep you entertained and
educated. So whether you run Linux on your pocketwatch or need a
bicycle to get from one end of your data center to the other, this issue is
perfect for you. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed putting it
together.
