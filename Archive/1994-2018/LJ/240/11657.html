Standardizing addresses, finding users and customizing content are just
three ways geolocation can improve your Web applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x20a1358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's an old saying in the real-estate business that the three most
important things in a property are location, location and location.
We can assume this is still true when it comes to real estate,
but it also is increasingly true when it comes to Web applications. A
number of my recent consulting projects have included, in one way or
another, the need to work with addresses and locations of various
sorts.
</p><p>
This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, given the many ways 
that the Web is becoming the way we communicate, store
information and work. It gives me a warm (if somewhat creepy)
feeling when a site I go to wishes me a &ldquo;good morning&rdquo;,
because it
knows it is now morning in my part of the world. It's useful when
a mapping program starts off by displaying my current location as a
default. And as the person running various applications, I like the
fact that I can learn basic geographical information about my
users&mdash;both so I can offer additional services while simultaneously
receiving useful data.
</p><p>
Working with street addresses, location coordinates and the like
falls under the umbrella of &ldquo;geolocation&rdquo;. So in this article, I
review a few of the technologies and options that use geolocation and
offer some suggestions as to how you can include such features in your
own Web applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x20a1670"></a>
Which Server?</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing to realize when it comes to geolocation is that you're
almost certainly not going to be able to do it alone. Sure, given
enormous amounts of time and money, you probably could figure out the
locations and street addresses of most people in the world, but
you're unlikely to do this. This means you're going to have to
connect to one or more companies that owns and distributes mapping
information via an API, such as Google, Bing (Microsoft) or similar.
</p><p>
There are free and open-source alternatives to commercial map
providers, such as <a href="http://freegeoip.net" target="_self">freegeoip.net</a> and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_self">www.openstreetmap.org</a>. However, the
APIs of the commercial offerings are richer and seem to be better
supported. Even some of the free services will require or expect that
you have an API key, for which you need to register. This allows them
to track how many requests you are making and to limit your usage
unless you pay for a commercial tier. Although it is useful and nice to
work with open-source tools, the remainder of this column assumes you are working with a commercial provider.
</p><p>
Note that some API libraries provide a single interface to multiple
servers for both street addresses and IP addresses. For example, the
Geocoder gem for Ruby (written and maintained by Alex Reisner) lets
you choose from a number of different mapping providers and also from
a number of IP address providers, defaulting to Google and freegeoip.net,
respectively. You then can decide whether to use free or commercial
services, or a mix of them, depending on your use case.
</p><p>
It's also important to remember that the accuracy is far from 100%.
For example, I decided to look up an old address of mine
from when I was living in Skokie, Illinois. I wrote a small Ruby
program to do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'geocoder'
Geocoder.search('9120b niles center road skokie il')
</pre>
</p><p>
Google, the default decoding system, almost immediately returned with
a better-formatted version of the address, along with a great deal of
other information. I was able to get the address out of the system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Geocoder.search('9120b niles center road skokie 
 &#8618;il')[0].formatted_address
    =&gt; "9120C Niles Center Road, Skokie, IL 60076, USA"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the fact is that the B and C units in that particular townhouse
are right next to one another. And it's likely that if I were to look
on a map, or even send mail to one of those addresses, the difference
would be obvious. But as you can see, the address returned from
Google is not necessarily the right one.
</p><p>
One of the nice things about Google's API is that it includes a large
number of locations around the world. For example, I can look up my
current address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Geocoder.search('14 migdal oz street modiin israel')
</pre>
</p><p>
But in this case, I don't get an address that matches mine, but rather
the overall entry for my city of Modi'in. I actually don't even get
back a single entry, but rather three, each of which represents
Modi'in in a different way, with a slightly different spelling. The
differences between the entries is most obvious if I ask for the
coordinates from each of the three returned result objects:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Geocoder.search('14 migdal oz street modiin 
 &#8618;israel').map {|a| a.geometry['location'] }
=&gt; [
    [0] { "lat" =&gt; 31.90912, "lng" =&gt; 35.002462 },
    [1] { "lat" =&gt; 31.890267, "lng" =&gt; 35.010397 },
    [2] { "lat" =&gt; 31.893661, "lng" =&gt; 34.96079 }
]
</pre>
</p><p>
For many purposes, these coordinates are all close enough. However,
if you are creating an application that depends on exact precision,
such as a GIS navigation application, you're likely going to need to
compare different services and perhaps even perform multiple queries, taking the result that most closely matches the location of interest.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x20a1cf8"></a>
Addresses and Coordinates</h2></div></div><p>
You now have seen several examples of how you easily can perform
geocoding with the Geocoder Ruby gem. Given an address, you can
invoke the &ldquo;search&rdquo; class method on the Geocoder object, getting an
array of Geocoder result objects, containing various pieces of
information about the resulting address. Even if there is only a
single result, you will receive an array. And, the Google API tries
hard to match something. It returned a result for &ldquo;1 Main Street,
Fredonia&rdquo;, but returned an empty array when I entered &ldquo;1 zzz street,
yyy qqq&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The result object contains a great deal of information. If I am
interested in a standardized version of the address, I can invoke the
&ldquo;address_components&rdquo; method on the result object, which will return an
array of hashes containing the street number, street name, village
name and so forth. This portion of the result contains more
information than you need to address an envelope in the United
States&mdash;for example, it includes the county and city name, as well as the
state and postal code. You can grab these pieces of information
separately or invoke methods that pull them together. I can use the
&ldquo;formatted_address&rdquo; method (shown above) to get a complete
address or 
the &ldquo;street_address&rdquo; method to get just the most important parts.
</p><p>
Several of the applications I've written for clients during the past few
years have used geocoding APIs to standardize the addresses, ensuring
that they have an &ldquo;official&rdquo; address that meets US specifications. This
also helps avoid misspellings and other errors that can cause
trouble down the road. Thus, even when a user enters his or her own
address, we run it through a geocoding facility and store the result
of this search. (It's probably a good idea to store the originally
entered address as well.)
</p><p>
Instead of (or in addition to) an address, you'll often want to get the
coordinates, including longitude and latitude. Because coordinates
give an exact location on the globe, you can use them in a variety
of places that aren't tied to individual addresses, like mapping
software or GIS databases (such as PostGIS, a GIS extension to
PostgreSQL). If I have the coordinates of a particular place, I 
then can draw that on a map with a great deal of accuracy. Two of my
clients in recent years have asked that I hide users' addresses when
displayed on maps for privacy reasons. Making up addresses (for example,
changing &ldquo;123 Main Street&rdquo; to &ldquo;456 Main Street&rdquo;) is almost guaranteed
to cause trouble and failure, but changing the coordinates by a small
random factor has worked quite well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x20a2220"></a>
Geocoding IP Addresses</h2></div></div><p>
Although some of my geocoding work has involved taking addresses from the
user's input, much of it has been just the opposite&mdash;trying to
figure out the user's location and then doing something with that
information. In other words, I would like to take the user's IP
address and use that to pinpoint the user's location.
</p><p>
The first thing to realize is that the need for such things has been
reduced, to some degree at least, by the HTML5 API for geolocation.
That API, implemented on the client and in JavaScript, allows an
application to ask the browser to report its current location. (The
standard requires that a browser ask the user before sending location
information.) You then can use the information inside a Web page
using JavaScript or invoke an Ajax call to send that information to
the server, where it can be parsed and used.
</p><p>
On one recent project, I wasn't interested in bothering the user with
geolocation information or in using that information within a Web
application. Rather, I wanted to review an application's logs and
summarize the countries from which visitors had come. To do this, I
needed to review each logfile entry and then look for each IP
address, determining its country.
</p><p>
Now, note that this kind of information can be grossly
inaccurate. For example, I'm currently writing this in my local
public library in Modi'in, Israel, and my IP address is being reported
as 81.218.200.112 to the outside world. I can ask Geocoder to tell me
where it thinks I am:

<pre     class="programlisting">
result = Geocoder.search('81.218.200.112')
</pre>
</p><p>
And unfortunately, it has no idea, other than the fact that I'm in
Israel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
result[0].country
  =&gt; "Israel"
result[0].city
  =&gt; ""
</pre>
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.iplocation.net" target="_self">www.iplocation.net</a>, which offers IP location to
individual visitors, it thinks I'm in Petach Tikva&mdash;a fine
city, but a 40-minute drive from where I'm sitting. That's because
the geolocation is looking for the telecom facility, or the provider,
rather than the specific location where I'm located.
</p><p>
So you always should take IP geolocation with a healthy dose of
skepticism. Moreover, plenty of IP addresses are not
in geolocation databases. Others are tied to companies or to
services (for example, Google's searchbot) that will come to your site and
make requests, but for which there is no location. And then there are
the visitors who come to your site via cellular phones and services,
which often can be national in scope and thus fail to provide an
accurate reading.
</p><p>
That said, if you are interested in finding out general information
about your users&mdash;their countries of origin and time zones&mdash;then
IP location can work quite well. As you can see, the Geocoder gem lets
you use the same class method, &ldquo;search&rdquo;, to request information about
an IP address. It figures out whether you're entering an IP address,
coordinates or a street address, and handles it accordingly. For one
recent project, I was able to provide interesting information and
analytics about the countries from which people came, simply by
running the IP addresses through an IP geolocation library.
</p><p>
As a general rule, you never should perform such an action in real
time, when the user is coming to your site. You are much better off
running a background task or an hourly cron job. As you collect and
store the IP location information, you almost certainly should store
it in a database, or at least cache it, to avoid too many requests to
the geolocation service.
</p><p>
If you do end up using Geocoder with Rails, you get a
&ldquo;location&rdquo;
method that you can invoke on the &ldquo;request&rdquo; object, allowing you to
get the user's information automatically, via IP address. I
have not tested this to see if calling the &ldquo;location&rdquo; method
significantly adds to the response time, or if it is somehow handled
in a separate thread, or by turning to a cached copy of the data on
the local server, but it would be wise to check the performance hit
before putting it into production.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x20a2900"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
I have barely mentioned configuration so far, because I've found
that Geocoder works so well out of the box. That said, there have been
times when I have wanted or needed to reconfigure it. Fortunately,
configuration is quite simple and straightforward, and is accomplished
by invoking the Geocoder.configure class method.
</p><p>
For example, while working on this article at the library, I found
that the Wi-Fi connection was quite slow&mdash;so much so that even simple
API calls were timing out. I was pleasantly surprised to find that
the Geocoder gem was smart enough to realize the problem was a
timeout and suggest that I might want to avoid the timeout by
invoking Geocoder.configure. Now, that's the sort of error message I
would like to see more often! So, I invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Geocoder.configure(:timeout =&gt; 1000)
</pre>
</p><p>
And sure enough, my future calls worked just fine, even if they took a
while to execute.
</p><p>
You always can get the current configuration settings by invoking
Geocoder.location without any options. This returns a hash with all
of the name-value pairs associated with the configuration system.
</p><p>
First, if you want to use a different geocoding API than the
default of Google, you can do so by changing the &ldquo;lookup&rdquo; parameter in
the configuration system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Geocoder.configure(lookup: :nominatim)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the results from a search will not be an array of
Geocoder::Result::Google (which is what you received before), but
rather Geocoder::Result::Nominatim. Each result object has a
different set of methods and attributes, which means you cannot
simply swap one API for another. The methods and data available
reflect the information received from the geocoding API as best as
possible.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Geolocation is far from perfectly accurate. However, this lack of
precision doesn't mean that you should avoid using it in your
applications. Whether you want to give localized greetings to your
users, standardize addresses or create summaries and reports of who
has been accessing your application, geocoding is a technique you
likely will find useful for many of your applications. As easy as the
commercial and free APIs may be to use, the existence of such
open-source libraries like Geocoder makes it even easier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fa9580.0x249b078"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for the Ruby Geocoder gem is at
<a href="https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder" target="_self">https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder</a>. The gem is still under
active development, and the GitHub page includes a great deal of
documentation and examples.
</p><p>
The open-source and free geocoding site <a href="http://freegeoip.net" target="_self">freegeoip.net</a> and the
<a href="http://OpenStreetMap.org" target="_self">OpenStreetMap.org</a> application (which is building a map of the world
that anyone can use) are both worth visiting, and perhaps even
incorporating into your application.
</p><p>
If you are a Python user, you should look at the pygeocoder
package, available at PyPI (<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi" target="_self">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</a>), which does similar things to the
Geocoder Ruby gem discussed in this column.
</p><p>
Finally, if you are interested in storing the results of geolocation
in a database, you should look into PostGIS (<a href="http://postgis.org" target="_self">postgis.org</a>), an
extension to the PostgreSQL database that includes GIS. I am still
taking my first steps with PostGIS, but the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostGIS in
Action</em></span>
written by Regina Obe and Leo Hsu, and published by Manning, provides
a useful introduction and tutorial.
