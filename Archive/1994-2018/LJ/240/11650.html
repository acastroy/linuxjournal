SUSE's kGraft</h2></div></div><p>
SUSE opines that the differentiating factor in its new live, runtime
patching solution for the Linux kernel, called kGraft, is its status as
the only competing solution in the upstream Linux kernel. By extension, none
of the other major Linux distributions provide updates this way. kGraft,
developed by SUSE Labs, makes it easier for IT staff to install critical
security and other patches without system downtime&mdash;the holy grail
of uptime. The net benefit for enterprise Linux users is a significant
enhancement of uptime in mission-critical environments. SUSE adds that
although kGraft is, by choice, limited to replacing whole functions and
constants they reference, this does not limit the set of code patches
that can be applied significantly. kGraft will offer tools to assist in
creating the live patch modules, identifying which functions need to be
replaced based on a patch and creating the patch module source code.

Wibu-Systems' CodeMeter</h2></div></div><p>
Faced with increasing complexity in network environments and software
agreements, IT staff members are challenged to keep accurate accounting of
their software assets, contracts and entitlements. The CodeMeter software
copy protection and licensing tool is a solution that simplifies this
complexity. The new CodeMeter v5.10 now provides software developers with
a graphical display in its WebAdmin tool that enables network-license
customers to have an accurate accounting of all allocated licenses and
users as well as rejected requests. End users simply can refresh their
browsers to get instant updates of network license usage. CodeMeter's
protection against software piracy, tampering and unauthorized usage
can be software- or hardware-based and can support a wide range of
licensing models. With CodeMeter, asserts Wibu-Systems, IT staff members can
reduce application costs, allocate licenses efficiently and improve
license security.

WeVideo</h2></div></div><p>
To its developers, WeVideo is significantly more than a mere collaborative
video editing platform&mdash;it is a storytelling movement. Because
WeVideo is cloud-based, social video editing is possible on the
platform&mdash;that is, people joining together on-line to create a video project. Inspired
by customer feedback, WeVideo's newest release includes one of the
most requested features: Text Customization. Callouts also have been
improved, and performance and rendering improvements are making the
WeVideo experience smoother and more trouble-free. Exported files now
are faster and of higher quality. The Android Video Editor, which WeVideo
calls best of breed, now enjoys support for 720p and 1080p exports,
Android 4.4 and Emoji symbols. Finally, the WeVideo Academy library of
tips and step-by-step video lessons continues to grow, helping users
more easily create the stories they want to tell.

Philippe Capet and Thomas Delavallade's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information
Evaluation</em></span> (Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
If you are browsing for a &ldquo;For Dummies&rdquo; book, please don't read on. On
the other hand, if you are in the market for a real intellectual challenge
on, say, the philosophical nature of knowledge and how humans process it,
this is for you. The new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information Evaluation</em></span>
edited by Philippe
Capet and Thomas Delavallade explores how we humans view information
and filter it based on our own personal beliefs and convictions. We
bestow upon a piece of information a certain amount of confidence on its
provenance and credibility. Capet and Delavallade seek to understand and
explain how these judgments are conceived, in what context and to what
end. Spanning the approaches offered by philosophy, military intelligence,
algorithmics and information science, this book presents the concepts of
information and the confidence placed in it. It further reveals ways to
evaluate information for the good of the military, economic intelligence
and, more globally, the informational monitoring by governments and
businesses.

Real Time Logic's Mako Server</h2></div></div><p>
As a compact application and Web server, Real Time Logic's Mako Server
helps developers rapidly design server-side Web applications. The Mako
Server provides a bare-bones Web application server environment from which
developers can design and implement complete, custom solutions. The latest
Mako Server now includes the C source code, which enables developers to
compile the Web application server for any embedded Linux platform. In
addition, Real Time Logic's BarracudaDrive&mdash;a personal cloud server
solution letting people set up and operate their own secure file-sharing
site&mdash;has been released as a plugin for Mako Server. Releasing
BarracudaDrive source code enables developers and technical users to
compile the source code for many specialized embedded Linux platforms
such as OpenWrt, dd-wrt, CuBox and so on.

Charles E. Spurgeon and Joann Zimmerman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ethernet: The Definitive
Guide</em></span>, 2nd edition (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
The updated 2nd edition to Charles E. Spurgeon and Joann Zimmerman's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ethernet: The Definitive Guide</em></span> is classic
O'Reilly&mdash;practical, to the
point, with the quintessential animal on the cover. In
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ethernet</em></span>, readers
discover what it takes to build, manage and scale Ethernet LANs, from
basic Ethernet operation to network management. Further, they'll learn
the answers to common questions, such as &ldquo;What can I do to make sure
that my Ethernet network works as well as possible?&rdquo; &ldquo;When do I need to
upgrade to higher speed Ethernet, and how do I do that?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do Ethernet
switches work, and how can I use them to build larger networks?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How can
I manage the network, what problems should I be looking for, and how can
I troubleshoot the system when problems arise?&rdquo; This thoroughly revised
2nd edition includes descriptions of the most widely used Ethernet
media systems, including 10, 40 and 100 Gigabit Ethernet, as well as a
complete glossary of terms used throughout the book and a resource list.

Untangle Inc.'s Next Generation Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
Because the operating margins of small- and medium-size businesses are
so slim, these operations can't afford downtime. To improve business
continuity for these SMBs, Untangle Inc. developed the open-source
Next Generation (NG) Firewall, which is now in version 10.1. NG
Firewall is a next-generation platform for deploying network-based
applications. The platform unites these applications around a common GUI,
database and reporting. NG Firewall's applications inspect network
traffic simultaneously, greatly reducing the resource requirements of
each individual application. The new version 10.1 now provides high
availability via virtual router redundancy protocol (VRRP). It allows
organizations to deploy multiple Untangle servers as hot or cold backups,
and in the event of a system failure, one of the backup servers will
take over. Network users will continue to have uninterrupted access to
the Internet, minimizing the impact of an outage.

Stealth.com Inc.'s LPC-630F PC</h2></div></div><p>
Stealth.com's LittlePC products are targeted at demanding applications,
such as HMI, embedded control, digital signs, kiosks, process control,
mobile navigation, thin clients and data acquisition. The company's latest
addition to the LittlePC line is the LPC-630F, a high-performance,
fanless, small-form computer with third-generation Core i7 processing
power. Stealth.com says that the LPC-630F is loaded with features
generally found in systems many times its diminutive size. The machines
are encapsulated in a rugged extruded aluminum chassis performing
as a heat sink to dissipate heat build-up. Its compact size 7.9" x
7.9" x 2.56" (200 x 200 x 65 mm) makes it ideal for space-challenged
applications. Systems are compatible with Linux and Microsoft Windows
and can be custom configured to meet the exact needs of the OEM or
end user.
