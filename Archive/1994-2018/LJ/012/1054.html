    If you happen to be visiting Amsterdam for business,
    leisure, or, say, and International Linux Symposium, these
    important travel tips might come in handy.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc2580.0xeba3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ah, Europe. There's no place like it.
Except for, maybe, certain neighborhoods in Chicago, but there it's
easier to get through customs. At any rate, not long ago I had the
privilege to speak at the International Linux Symposium in
Amsterdam, which is a small town in upstate New York. Ha ha! Just
kidding. I'm talking about the version of Amsterdam found in the
Netherlands, of course, which is a large city with a lot of canals
and people who speak Dutch. When I first heard about the
conference, I was certainly interested but perhaps not very
optimistic about my ability to find a few thousand dollars worth of
change between the sofa cushions. Then something dawned on me:
would I <span   class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> have another legitimate excuse to
visit Amsterdam? Probably not, so I managed to pull off the travel
expenses and hop on a plane to the fair city of canals. En route I
even managed to pull together a talk about applications porting,
but I had a lot of help from the flight crew.
</p><p>Well, needless to say, I had such a wonderful time in
Amsterdam that I feel it's my moral duty to share with you the many
varied pieces of travelling wisdom that I accumulated during the
week-long adventure. Otherwise you might run into the same problems
that I did, while I was there, and let me tell you up front that
it's not much fun to be yelled at (in Dutch, no less) by a very
angry waiter wielding a fork and knife. With the handy tidbits
contained in this article, you should be able to handle the
situation with ease. (Hint: whenever possible, use the Dutch phrase
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hoe laat opent het zwembad?</em></span> I have no idea
what it means, but it seems to calm people down.)</p><p>Amsterdam is a nice place to go if you enjoy being run over.
Michael K. Johnson, <i  >LJ</i>'s illustrious editor,
and I learned this the hard way as soon as we stepped out of the
RAI train station from the airport. There we were, trying to get
our bearings, taking in the countryside, observing the locals,
etc., standing in what <span   class="emphasis"><em>appeared</em></span> to be an
innocent walkway. Walkway? Fat chance. This was none other than the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bicycle lane</em></span>, which is widely regarded as one
of the most dangerous places on the face of the Earth to stand with
a map and five large pieces of luggage. Later, we discovered that
standing in the bike lane is a capital crime in the
Netherlands&mdash;that is, if you don't get killed in the act.</p><p>So, there we were, looking like your canonical tourists, when
a moped screamed by doing 80 KPH (that's 3 million miles per hour,
for those of you in the US), nearly knocking Michael into the road,
which is a lot like the bike lane except that the vehicles there
are much more deadly. In fact, the crosswalks in Amsterdam have
lights marked with the international symbols for &ldquo;Don't Walk&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Good Luck&rdquo;. Crossing the street is always an adventure, and well
worth the price of the trip alone, in case you're into near-death
experiences.</p><p>All cab drivers in Amsterdam are certified maniacs. After
discovering the dangers of being a pedestrian (the Dutch word for
which is, literally, &ldquo;bumper fodder&rdquo;) I wanted to see what it was
like on the other side of the wheel and opted for travel by taxicab
whenever possible. The first thing to realize here is that you
can't hail a cab in Amsterdam, but you can call for one. Another
big surprise is that the Dutch have perfected teleportation
technology, demonstrated by the fact that no later than thirty
seconds after you hang up the phone, a cab will materialize in
front of you. This is certainly convenient, especially when you
happen to call from your hotel room.</p><p>I was sure that I'd feel safer taking the cab, somehow lulled
into a false sense of security by the fact that I'd be riding in
the comfort of a six-ton shuddering hunk of metal with an alert,
safety-conscious driver at the wheel. Wrong again. Taxicab drivers
in Amsterdam are required, by law, to scare the hell out of their
passengers at least twice during the trip. Tipping the driver
didn't seem to help, either. But what a thrill! Humming along at
120 KPH, weaving in and out of heavy traffic, surviving at least a
dozen near-misses with unwary pedestrians (ha!) and other vehicles
(including streetcars), with a driver who's more involved in
finishing his cigarette and staring out of the side window while
changing the radio than, say, holding onto the steering wheel. I
don't know about you, but this is what I call excitement. I was so
impressed that I was alive and in one piece after the trip that I
paid the driver twice the amount of the actual fare. So taking the
taxi in Amsterdam gets high marks in my book.</p><p>Be very, very careful when ordering food. Although nearly
everyone I met in Amsterdam spoke at least seven languages,
including English, this fact didn't seem to help at the local pubs
and restaurants. I would routinely enter such an eating
establishment and be presented with a menu listing such enticing
items as <span   class="emphasis"><em>hutspot met klapstuk</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>uitsmijter</em></span>, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pijptabak</em></span>. Being completely ignorant of the
local language and custom, I stuck to the more obvious choices such
as <span   class="emphasis"><em>koffie</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>broodje</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pannekoek</em></span>, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>bier</em></span>-the
last of which turned out to be a reliable default. But I do
recommend being brave and ordering entrees at random. You might end
up with a wonderful culinary delight such as a piece of white
toast, as I did. Before you know it you'll learn what not to
order.</p><p>Another thing: don't let waitresses at Indonesian restaurants
constantly serve you their fun 'n' fruity mixed drinks during the
course of the meal, because they'll turn out to be ten guilders a
pop. One caveat with this approach: after several of aforementioned
drinks, you may not notice them being served. Be on your guard at
all times!</p><p>The red light district isn't for the faint of heart. Unless,
of course, you're into places with names such as the Banana Bar,
but I need not go into detail here. On the other hand, the red
light district was the home of the most wonderful Spanish
restaurant, which we, the teeming mob of mad Linuxers, took over
and held all of the chefs for ransom. Just kidding! We were
actually served a delightful five-course meal without the necessity
of holding the head waiter at gunpoint. At least I think it was
five courses-I stopped counting after three. Just imagine the
scene: a restaurant full of nearly a hundred Linux users, including
such shining figureheads as Remy Card, Fred van Kempen, and Linus
Torvalds himself, chowing down on enough Spanish food to feed the
armada, having a riotous good time discussing the pros and cons of,
say, multiple filesystem block sizes. The amount of geekiness in
that room was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I had to duck
out routinely for a breath of fresh air-but alas, I was trapped in
the back alleys of Amsterdam's most visceral neighborhood. Bon
appetit!</p><p>You can find the finest coffee in the world in Amsterdam.
Really! Scattered all over town are many gourmet coffee shops,
wherein the dark brew is served in large quantities. If you think
that's interesting, you'll really enjoy the lavish style of these
bistros, with their foil-covered ceilings, subdued lighting, and
pictures of Bob Marley adorning the walls. Very bizarre. While I
won't pretend to understand the Dutch taste in coffee shop decor, I
will vouch for the quality of coffee served within-something you
won't want to miss while in Amsterdam.</p><p>Well, there you have it. I hope that the above advice will
help you to get around Amsterdam in better shape than I did. Oh,
and one last bit of guidance for your trip: No matter what anybody
tells you, it really is fun to get lost amongst narrow, winding
streets with names like Leiuweijkstraat and Geifen von vijkeslaan
at three o'clock in the morning. Try it some time. You'll thank me
later.</p></div></div>
