    Linux comes with the networking tools. Terry shows you how
    to get your Linux system talking over Ethernet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eab580.0x1fa33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many people who install Linux on a
machine at their workplace or university also wish to connect their
machine to the local area network, so that they can make use of an
Internet connection or other machines on the network. If you are
one of these people and the only thing that has been stopping you
is not knowing where to start, I hope this article will demonstrate
that it is easy to do so-as long as you are properly prepared and
know what things to watch out for.</p><p>The following are a few key areas to consider when connecting
your Linux machine to a network:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The type of network you are connecting to.</p></li><li><p>The type of network interface card (NIC) you will
need.</p></li><li><p>Configuring the kernel to support the network
interface card.</p></li><li><p>Addresses-Host, network, broadcast and
router.</p></li><li><p>Configuring Linux for your network
connection.</p></li><li><p>Routing.</p></li><li><p>Names and nameservers.</p></li></ul></div><p>The type of network you are connecting to is very important
for a number of reasons. Most important is the many different
network types. Currently Linux provides good support for Ethernet
networks, but not much support for other network types such as
ARCNet, Token Ring, FDDI and wireless LANs. If you intend to use an
Ethernet network, keep reading. If not, don't despair&mdash;some very
promising development efforts are under way to provide support for
the other types of networks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eab580.0x1fa3a80"></a>Ethernet</h2></div></div><p>If you are fortunate enough to have an Ethernet network to
connect to, then you still have to determine what type of cabling
has been installed. Two popular types of cabling are employed, and
you will need to find out which has been installed so you can
choose an appropriate type of network interface card. The most
popular cabling types are 10base2, commonly called &ldquo;ThinNet&rdquo;, which
uses 5mm diameter coaxial cable and BNC (bayonet type) connectors,
and 10baseT, commonly called &ldquo;twisted pair&rdquo; or &ldquo;unshielded twisted
pair&rdquo;, which uses a cable with four conductors and an RJ-45
(telephone type) connector. The type of cabling will help determine
what type of network interface card to choose for your Linux
machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eab580.0x1fa3b88"></a>Ethernet Card</h2></div></div><p>Your network interface card needs to have a connector that
suits the cabling type you have installed. A number of modern cards
come with both types of connector, and these are generally called
&ldquo;combo&rdquo; cards. You should also think about whether you want a card
suitable for an 8 bit slot or a 16 bit slot. The 16 bit cards
perform better but are generally slightly more expensive. Another
factor to consider is the bus type. If you are using a PCI machine,
naturally you will need a NIC that suits a PCI bus. Be careful: you
must also ensure that the type of card you choose is supported by a
Linux kernel driver. It is best to avoid &ldquo;clone&rdquo; cards. While Linux
supports some clones of popular cards, not all clones are the same.
To be sure there are no problems, obtain the genuine article or try
the card before you buy it. The Ethernet-HOWTO lists the types of
cards supported by Linux and contains descriptions of each of them.
You should refer to it before spending any money on a card.</p><p>The HOWTO recommends you opt for a 16 bit card such as the
3Com 3c503/16 or the SMC Elite 16/WD8013. Other cards which you
might consider if you have a Vesa Local Bus or PCI motherboard are
the BOCA Research cards. You might also choose an NE2000, but be
careful, since some cards that claim 100% compatibility are not
100% compatible. (Their claims are based on being &ldquo;100% software
compatible&rdquo;, meaning that they provide drivers for DOS that allow,
for example, NetWare access. These drivers are useless with
Linux.)</p><p>Cards to <span   class="emphasis"><em>avoid</em></span> are the 3Com 3c501 card
(it performs badly and is broken by design) and Cabletron and
Xircom cards, since free Linux drivers are unlikely ever to be
available for their products, because these companies have chosen
to require a non-disclosure agreement before releasing programming
information, which would make it illegal to write a freely
distributable Linux driver.</p><p>When installing the NIC you must make sure that the card's
configuration does not clash with any other installed hardware.
Some cards come with a DOS program to configure them. They use a
programmable interface, and you should run this to &ldquo;strap&rdquo; the card
with the configuration you want. You should be particularly careful
of the IRQ, control port address and shared memory address
settings. Each of these must be free for your NIC to use and be
unused by any other hardware in the computer. I use a WD8003
strapped for control port 0x280, IRQ 7 and Shared Memory 0xD0000.
Be careful if you use specialized hardware such as SCSI controllers
or Multiport Serial cards, as they often use IRQ or Control Port
settings in similar ranges, and may conflict. After you have
physically installed the NIC, your next step is to check if your
kernel already has support for your card. If it doesn't, recompile
it so that it does. The easiest way to check if your kernel already
supports your card is to reboot your machine. Check that the card
is properly detected by the kernel by reading the messages the
kernel prints when it is booting. If your card is properly
detected, the kernel will print a message something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eth0: WD80x3 at 0x280, 00 00 C0 AD 37 1C WD8003,
        IRQ 7, shared memory at 0xd0000-0xd1fff.
        wd.c:v1.10 9/23/94 Donald Becker
        (becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov)
</pre><p>The settings listed should match those that you configured
your card for. If your card has not been properly detected, rebuild
your kernel to make sure the kernel has support. This is pretty
straightforward and you have likely done it before. You simply
change to the <b  >/usr/src/linux</b> directory and run
<b  >make config</b>. You will be prompted as to whether
to include various drivers. The most important sections for you to
answer Yes to are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Networking Support?</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP networking?</p></li><li><p>Network device support?</p></li><li><p>The driver for your card.</p></li></ul></div><p>After you have configured the kernel to support all of the hardware
you have installed, you do a <b  >make dep; make</b> to
build the kernel. Don't forget to do a <b  >make
zlilo</b> so that <b  >lilo</b> will run your new
kernel when you reboot. If you are happy that all has gone well,
then you can reboot your machine and check that your card is
properly detected as described earlier. If it isn't, double check
that you have done everything correctly and that you have no
hardware conflict. If you still have problems, refer to the
Ethernet-HOWTO again, as it has lots of information to help guide
you through determining what might be the problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eab580.0x1fa43c8"></a>Software configuration</h2></div></div><p>If you are still with me, you are nearly ready to run. All
you need to run are a few commands to start testing your network
connection. After you have configured your kernel, you have to
configure your Linux machine to suit your network. At this point
you need worry about IP addresses. If you are lucky, you will have
a network administrator who will have assigned you an IP address
and told you the network and broadcast addresses to use. If not,
you will have to find out another way. A good way is often to check
the configuration of another machine that is already working. The
network address is an address that refers to the whole network you
are connected to. It is advertised so that people on other networks
know how to get to you. Your host IP address is one address that
belongs to that network. This must be yours and only yours, or else
you will face lots of strange problems, so make sure you don't use
a host address someone else is already using. The broadcast address
is a special address that allows anyone to send data to everyone on
your network. Some special services use this, and it is very
important that it be configured to the appropriate value. Another
important number you will need is your &ldquo;netmask&rdquo;. This is a
mechanism that allows your machine to determine which host
addresses are local to you (on the same network) and which ones are
remote. The following example would be typical of what you would
expect to find:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IP address:             202.105.54.56
Network address:        202.105.54.0
Broadcast address:      202.105.54.255
Netmask:                255.255.255.0
</pre><p>Once you have this information, be sure you have the correct
software on your Linux machine. You must be particularly careful to
ensure that the network tools you have (<b  >ifconfig,
route</b>) match the version of kernel you use. The
NET-2-HOWTO describes where to get these tools and how to install
them. If you run the <b  >ifconfig</b> program with no
command-line arguments, you will see that it lists the device
mentioned in the kernel boot messages: &ldquo;eth0&rdquo;. This is your
Ethernet device. It needs to be configured with the information
above, and the <b  >ifconfig</b> program is designed to
do just that. Use a command line such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth0 HOST netmask NETMASK\
     broadcast BROADCAST up
</pre><p>So for the above example use the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth0 202.105.54.56\
        netmask 255.255.255.0\
        broadcast 202.205.54.255 up
</pre><p>If you again run the <b  >ifconfig</b> command with no
command line arguments, you should see it now has the appropriate
values configured.
</p><p><a href="1051s1.html" target="_self">More configuration
info</a></p><p>Once you have your Ethernet device configured, you have one
step remaining. As described earlier, the netmask tells your
machine which addresses are local and which are remote. If the
address is local, your Linux machine can route any datagrams
directly to the Ethernet device. If they are remote, datagrams
should be sent to the route which supports the link to the rest of
the Internet. The router also has an address, so you will need to
obtain this from your network administrator. Linux keeps a special
table in memory to look up where to send datagrams. This table,
called the routing table, is manipulated with the
<b  >route</b> command. In a simple installation, as you
will most likely have, you will need to configure two routes for
your Ethernet: one for your local network, and another that tells
your Linux machine what to do with datagrams for any remote host.
This latter route is called the &ldquo;default&rdquo; route.</p><p>The route commands are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add NETWORK dev eth0
route add default gw ROUTER dev eth0
</pre><p>and for the example listed earlier (assuming the router
   address is as shown):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add 202.105.54.0 dev eth0
route add default gw 202.105.54.1 dev eth0
</pre><p>You can use the <b  >route -n</b> command to display the
contents of the routing table. The <b  >-n</b> argument
says to show the addresses as numbers and not try to look up their
names, because you don't yet have your name resolver configured. To
configure your name resolver, you will need to find out the address
of the &ldquo;NameServer&rdquo; or &ldquo;DNS&rdquo; from your network administrator and
put this address in your <b  >/etc/resolv.conf</b> file
in a line that looks like <b  >nameserver
NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN</b>, where <b  >NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN</b>
is the IP address of your nameserver.</p><p>Now you should be able to <b  >telnet</b> to other
IP hosts, both local and remote. If you have configured the name
resolver of your Linux machine, then you can use their names,
otherwise you should use their addresses.</p><p>In addition, the Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Administrator's
