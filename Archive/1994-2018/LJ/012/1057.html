seasoned hacker&mdash;someone who can code a device driver with the left
hand, install a 200-node network with the right, all while reciting
the pinouts of a parallel port-then skip this article. Novice to
Novice aims directly at the PC expert who knows nothing about Linux
or Unix, yet is curious about the uproar. As I am a complete Unix
beginner myself, hopefully my naive, embarrassing mistakes will
help many readers bypass much suffering and ridicule. This series
will follow as I try to reach goals appropriate, I think, for the
PC user who wants to learn Linux, yet doesn't want to modify
his/her existing setup. Getting Linux to run on a DOS disk using
UMSDOS is the obvious first goal. That, and getting X-Windows to
run, are the topics of this article.
</p><p><a href="1057s1.html" target="_self">Definitions</a></p><p>For the record, my system is a 486DX-66 with SVGA, dual
floppies, Logitech rodent, 14,400 baud modem, and a 350 meg hard
drive, of which the bulk is filled with games. I have managed to
clean off 150 megs for Linux, which the various manuals and ads
suggest is more than enough room. Both MS-DOS 6.2 and Windows 3.11
are installed (and frequently yelled at).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2877580.0x296f710"></a>Pick a card....</h2></div></div><p>Despite Unix being one of the longest-lived operating
systems, it still carries a mystique, one that has kept its
popularity from growing amongst the general public. Unix seems to
exist only in the darkest realms of academia, engineering, and
high-tech graphics. As a MS-DOS user for too many years, I decided
to finally learn Unix, and with that decision, I faced some
choices: local schools offered evening courses for a few hundred
dollars a pop; I could buy &ldquo;personal&rdquo; versions of most of the big
Unix products for still only a few hundred dollars; or I could
get&mdash;what was this?&mdash;some free version of Unix called Linux.
</p><p>Being a miser, I chose Linux. My friend, David Coons, who is
some sort of computer guru for Disney's Imagineering, heartily
recommended Morse Telecommunication's Slackware Professional 2.1.
He had bought a variety of releases and liked this one. He happily
explained why, but since the language he used consisted primarily
of acronyms, I just pursed my lips knowingly and nodded my head at
the right pauses. My criterion was far simpler: I figured anything
with a picture of &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; on it to be worthwhile. That this version
would allow me to run Linux without repartitioning my hard drive
sold me. UMSDOS seemed like a godsend.</p><p>I called ACC Bookstore, where I ordered the Slackware set as
well as the massive DrX Linux book. The order-taker reassured me
that Linux-particularly Slackware-was a great way to learn Unix and
not that difficult to figure out, at least on the basic
level.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Novice Note:</b></span> When you buy
Linux, see what type of information comes in the enclosed manual.
Slackware Professional comes with a 600-page book that duplicates
all the vital information in DrX Linux and is better organized. If
I had known, I wouldn't have ordered DrX Linux, since the
non-duplicated material includes things like &ldquo;The Kernel Hackers
Guide&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Japanese Language Extension HOW-TO&rdquo;. It will be a
long while before I understand Linux well enough to start hacking
the kernel, and by then, the manual will be outdated. For now, you
may want to save your money.</p><p>After ordering Linux, I went out and bought a CD-ROM player.
I had debated for months about whether to buy a quad-speed (since I
already have an original 8-bit SoundBlaster) or to buy the Creative
Labs Discovery Package which would upgrade my soundcard to 16-bits
but give me a less desirable double-speed CD-ROM. Again, the miser
won out and I got the Discovery kit. Not a bad deal, I
rationalized, since the rumors were that high-density CDs would
start to appear in a year or two, and I would rather be obsolete as
cheaply as possible. Also, Linux appears to have solid support for
Creative Labs' products. While installing the multimedia kit, I
switched my floppy drives so that the 3.5" became my
<b  >A:</b> and the 5.25" became <b  >B:</b>.
David had highly recommended doing this.</p><p>I got the CD drive, got Linux, got the manuals, and started
screaming. All the manuals suggested repartitioning using FIPS and
were of no help regarding UMSDOS-just vague references. Even Doom
is listed in the Slackware index but nothing about UMSDOS. I didn't
want to repartition! A call to David and he reassured me that the
options would be obvious on what to do when I ran
<b  >setup</b>, after first creating the boot and root
disks. Not to panic. Okay, thanks!</p><p>Ordinarily, I wouldn't have minded repartitioning. The
program to do so, FIPS, a non-data-destructive FDISK, is a
brilliant and obvious (are you listening, Microsoft?) utility, but
I worried that I might FIPS too much or too little disk space and
possibly even kill my MS-DOS programs. UMSDOS is what I wanted, a
no-commitment option.</p><p>Taking a deep breath and chanting the &ldquo;Doom&rdquo; mantra, I began.
Following the installation instructions (I hate to RTFM), the first
step was to prepare boot and root disks. Since I had a SoundBlaster
system, I assumed the SBPCD boot image would be the obvious choice.
For the root disk, I opted for UMSDS144, which was the mythological
UMSDOS system for 1.44 disks.</p><p>With these disks created, I booted with the boot disk. It
didn't recognize my CD player. Hmmmm. Of course! The Discovery Kit
used a Sony CDU-33a drive. I re-made the boot disk this time
choosing the CDU31a option. Yes! Rebooting with this new disk
showed Linux recognizing my drive.</p><p>I ignored the option to set boot parameters, put in the root
disk and stalled at the first hurdle. Did I want a swapfile on my
hard drive? I have eight megs of RAM and the manuals said with that
amount of RAM not too worry, so I just press
<b  >&lt;Enter&gt;</b> and got a Login prompt. A feeling
of lordly omnipotence washed over me as I smugly logged in as
<span   class="bold"><b>root</b></span> and ran setup.</p><p>A menu came up and the panic started again. Tags,
swapspace-what's with all the choices? I finally figured out that
the important first step for beginners is (T)arget. This will set
up a <b  >C:\LINUX</b> subdirectory on your hard drive
and prompt you through the other necessary procedures. You will
need to select a source; in my case a CD-ROM drive and
specifically, the Sony CDU-33a.</p><p>Next, you get to choose which disk sets to install. I decided
on all of them except the F series (FAQs and HOW-TOs). Finally, you
select a method of installation, whether everything goes to hard
drive (&ldquo;SLAKWARE&rdquo;-where you make all the decisions as to which
files to install) or three choices of TAG sets which preselect
which files to install: SLACKPRO (all files on the hard disk, with
upgrade capability); SLAKPRO2 (some files are links to CD but
without easy upgrade capability); or SLAKPRO3 (many links, again
without easy upgrade capability). Links are references on your hard
disk to the actual files on CD; this conserves hard disk space but
gives up access speed.</p><p>For my first installation attempt, I chose the &ldquo;slakware&rdquo;
option, so that everything would go to the hard drive. In the
middle of set &ldquo;X&rdquo; the drive ran out of space. Rebooting DOS and
using X-Tree (which ran out of memory), I deleted the contents of
<b  >C:\LINUX</b> for another try. I debated whether to
upgrade my drive to a full gigabyte. The mortgage was due, and as
you already know, I'm a miser, so I didn't.</p><p>My second installation was &ldquo;slakpro3&rdquo;, which put the fewest
files directly on the hard drive. This option would make later
upgrading difficult but is a good exploratory choice. It used only
15 meg, produced about 3000 files, and didn't do much. Commands
like <b  >adduser</b> didn't work. I'm not even sure the
the shell was active. Back to DOS for Linux deletion again.</p><p>The third installation I tried was to have all the files on
the hard drive (&ldquo;slackpro&rdquo;), because I didn't know that this was
larger than my previous &ldquo;slakware&rdquo; installation. After an hour,
sixteen <span   class="bold"><b>thousand</b></span> files, and 150
meg, my drive again ran out of space. Okay, maybe I don't need 2
million fonts for TeX, some of the programming tools, or network
stuff. Back to DOS, again. My guess is that 200 meg would handle
this type of installation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Novice Note:</b></span> The &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo;
disk sets both deal with installing the kernel, whether you want
IDE without SCSI, IDE with SCSI, etc. You may want to do two rounds
of installations: first, you would just deal with sets &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo;
to find <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> which kernel you want. My
choices narrowed down to CDU31ao (without SCSI support) or CDU31a
(with SCSI support); I installed CDU31a. Your second round of
installation would then cover all the other disk sets.</p><p>Fourth time, again using the &ldquo;slackpro&rdquo; option and ONLY
installing the A, AP, D, Q (for the correct kernel), and X data
sets, used 50 meg and created about 5000 files, but the
instructions regarding LOADLIN didn't work. Apparently LOADLIN
doesn't get copied over to the hard drive at any point. I found the
LOADLIN.ZIP in the KERNELS subdirectory on the Slackware disk,
unzipped it into <b  >C:\LINUX</b>, and modified the
given LINUX.BAT to launch it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 rem C:\LINUX.BAT
 echo off
 cls
 echo Put the Slackware CD in the drive!
 pause
 rem  First, ensure any unwritten disk buffers are flushed:
 smartdrv /C
 rem  Start the LOADLIN process:
 c:\linux\loadlin c:\linux\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda rw
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>IT WORKS!!! IT WORKS!!! IT
WORKS!!!</b></span> No more boot and root disks! The lack of
LOADLIN was likely the problem with &ldquo;slakpro3&rdquo; not working
correctly, but I won't try that out now that this setup works. I
&ldquo;<b  >adduser</b>&rdquo;ed an account for myself
with no problems, the procedure being very easy, and logged in on
that account via Alt-F2. This is &ldquo;way cool&rdquo;, having two active
accounts going simultaneously.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Novice Note:</b></span> Capitalization
counts! I went nearly crazy trying to run a configuration program.
The subdirectories were all
<span   class="bold"><b>spelled</b></span> correctly but some of the
letters had to be in capitals. I recommend installing the Mouseless
Commander. (I believe it is in the AP dataset. It is now called the
Midnight Commander, since it can now be used with a mouse, but
Slackware still refers to it as the Mouseless Commander in some
places.) It's a great Norton Commander clone and, for this X-tree
user, a comfort and an easy way to view files.</p><p><a href="1057s2.html" target="_self">Slackware</a></p><p>Well, it took four tries and at least as many hours, but the
Linux base is on the MS-DOS partition and appears to run smoothly.
I had no problems with either DOS or Windows after installing
Linux; it appeared as just another subdirectory, albeit with a ton
of files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2877580.0x2970580"></a>X-Windows</h2></div></div><p>Now to install X-Windows. I called David for just a couple of
clues. &ldquo;You're on your own. I didn't install X.&rdquo; I politely hung up
as he explained how he was writing an amazing device driver with
his left hand and installing a 200-node network with his right.
</p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, I highly recommend that before
you attempt to install X, you have on hand information about your
monitor-specifically bandwidth, horizontal synchronization, and
vertical refresh rate. The data should be in your monitor manual.
If not, the Linux guides suggest looking in the files called
&ldquo;modeDB.txt&rdquo; or &ldquo;Monitors&rdquo; located in
<b  >/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</b>. Best to have the actual
monitor guide. Also you should know what type of video card you
have. If you have MS-DOS 6.0 or later, the MSD program will give
you that information. In Linux, a program called SuperProbe will
also tell you.</p><p>Installation is relatively easy, but is only half the job.
Again, all this applies to Slackware Professional.</p><p>Change to the <b  >/usr/X11R6/lib/ConfigXF</b>
subdirectory (watch for capitalization!) and run ConfigXF. The
program will first ask for information about your mouse, if you
have one. I have a Logitech mouse so I selected the Microsoft
option. The guides suggest this, saying that only if you have an
older Logitech mouse should you choose the Logitech option. After
this, I agreed with the given defaults and having
<b  >/dev/mouse</b> as the path.</p><p>Onward to video cards. From the massive list, I chose the
Cirrus GD-5426. Next came a monitor list, and I opted for generic
VESA SVGA. After this, it asks you questions regarding virtual
desktop size and other things. Since I didn't understand half of
the questions, I just accepted the defaults. Eventually, you get to
a screen where you can save the set up, tune the set up, quit, and
other choices. For me the option to tune the set up just didn't
work, producing a variety of errors.</p><p>What did work is this: saving the set up to the default
choice. Edit <b  >/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</b>,
looking for the section called &ldquo;Monitor&rdquo;. You'll note that
Bandwidth, HorizSync, and VertRefresh are marked with &ldquo;EDIT
THIS!!!&rdquo; It took me too many times to realize that when the
X-installation program said you should edit the XF86Config file
that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> had to edit it. Now the
crucial part: replace the information in the file with the
information from your monitor manual.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Novice Note:</b></span> Take a few
minutes and learn to use the text editor
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>. Not only is this editor
ubiquitous and small, but many other programs use similar commands.
For instance, the <b  >:q</b> that will quit vi will also
get you out of the <b  >man</b> program.</p><p>For example, I entered the following for my CTX CMS-1561
Multiscan monitor:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Bandwidth 100
HorizSync 30-60
VertRefresh 50-90
</pre><p>In addition to these changes, I also added lines that
appeared in the Linux manuals but not in the XF86Config file. They
probably aren't needed, but what the heck. Under &ldquo;Keyboard&rdquo; I
added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AutoRepeat 500 5
</pre><p>Under section &ldquo;Screen&rdquo;, subsection &ldquo;Display&rdquo; I added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Depth 8
</pre><p>Save the file. Start X-Windows with startx (or xstart) and, with
luck, it will run. If it doesn't, get the Linux manual, skip the
automatic installation altogether, and carefully do it yourself,
checking that the information in the Config files match your
set-up.</p><p>Whew! Linux works. X-Windows works. What next? Well, I could
install the XAP disk set to give me programs to use when I am in X.
Doom could finally come out of hiding. Or I could install TeX and
see what those Klingon fonts look like. Or I could tackle SLIP and
see if I can get working access to the Internet. Or I could even
reassert my latent geekdom and write a &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo; program in
GNU C/C++. Linux has so much to explore-but then, that's the fun.
Watch out David and all you other Unix gods-we're coming up the
ladder!</p></div></div>
