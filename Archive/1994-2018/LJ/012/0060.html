you're using or installing Linux for the first time or you know the
ropes like a veteran. For the proto-Linuxer, the distribution comes
complete with a 28-page, CD-sized, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quick Start
Guide</em></span> which is based on Matt Welsh's Linux Installation
HOWTO. The three CD-ROMs are packed full of up-to-date Linux
distributions, documentation, source code and even a &ldquo;live&rdquo; file
system you can run your system from. The aptly named &ldquo;Developer's
Resource&rdquo; is a great value.
</p><p>InfoMagic delivers three CD-ROMs full of Linux and
Linux-related software with their latest offering, the
December-pressed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Developer's
Resource</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2341580.0x2439558"></a>What You Get</h2></div></div><p>The first disc comprises the on-line documentation (HOWTOs),
DOS utilities, and InfoMagic's large collection of Linux
distributions. They provide JE-0.9.3 (Japanese Extensions to
Linux), MCC-1.0+, Slackware-2.1.0, SLS-1.06, TAMU-1.0D, and
BOGUS-1.0.1. Some of these distributions aren't as up-to-date as
others, particularly the smaller ones such as MCC and TAMU, but
that is simply because they haven't been updated recently, not
because InfoMagic is shipping stale software. Other directories on
this disc contain a DOS-based installation program and a copy of
Microsoft's Multimedia Viewer with the HOWTOs compiled just for
it.</p><p>On the second disc you'll find mirrors of the SunSite Linux
FTP archive (ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux), Alan Cox's Linux
networking archive
(ftp://sunacm.swan.ac.uk/pub/misc/Linux/Networking), and the &ldquo;live&rdquo;
file system, which is a fully unpacked copy of the Slackware 2.1.0
distribution. In theory, and with a suitably fast CD-ROM drive, you
should be able to run off of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; file system on this disc
and a small root partition on your hard drive. Since InfoMagic
can't know which packages you wish to use from the CD, it is up to
you to set up the &ldquo;link farm&rdquo; on your root partition which points
to directories on the disc (i.e.
<b  >ln -s /cdrom/live/usr/local /usr/local</b>
).</p><p>The last disc contains copies of the tsx-11 Linux FTP archive
(ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux), the official Linux kernel archive
up to and including kernel version 1.1.72
(ftp://ftp.cs.helsinki.fi/pub/Software/Linux/Kernel) and the Free
Software Foundation FTP archive (ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu). To
avoid keeping redundant copies of the XFree86 X Window System with
both the tsx-11 and SunSite directories, InfoMagic has chosen to
split this large component out into its own directory. Releases
2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 3.1 are available.</p><p>Also on the last disc are the Debian-0.91 distribution;
Japanese HOWTO documents; the Wine Microsoft Windows emulator
archive; a Scheme interpreter; and the Oberon system, an object
oriented programming and operating environment. There are also some
demos of commercial products: the Unix Cockpit, an X-based file
manager and Executor, a Macintosh emulator which runs under Linux
(or doesn't - Executor doesn't seem to work under 1.1.x Linux
kernels, which prevented me from testing it). There is also
FlagShip, a CA/Clipper-like development system, and a
self-described &ldquo;early demo&rdquo; of a commercial BBS system for Linux,
called Zbbs.</p><p>This distribution has everything you need, whether you're
installing Linux for the first time or you know the ropes like a
veteran and want to update your system. There's plenty of
documentation in all sorts of formats, from the easily printed to
the easily browsed. The handy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quick Start
Guide</em></span> is an excellent primer for the novice Linux user.
It covers such important topics as device naming, drive
partitioning, and file system creation. When coupled with
InfoMagic's wide array of Linux distributions, you've got
everything you need to install Linux on your PC.</p><p>I find that distributions like this make for excellent
emergency backup media. They contain recent copies of all of the
major Linux distributions (pick your favorite) as well as more
recent stuff which you can cull from the Linux and GNU sources on
discs 2 and 3 and compile for yourself. If you're interested at all
in Unix or are a code junkie like myself, this is the package for
you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2341580.0x24398c8"></a>Using the Discs</h2></div></div><p>I've been using Linux for about two years and have it
installed on my PC at home. I've got two hard drives on my system,
an IDE drive where I keep all of my DOS and Windows stuff, and a
larger SCSI drive that I use for Linux. To test drive the
Developer's Resource, I decided that I'd clear out two
non-essential partitions from my Linux disk and install a couple of
different distributions in their stead. I backed up the old
partitions with my tape drive and got down to work.</p><p>I had enough room for a single 185 MB partition on which I
could install a distribution. With this amount of disk space I knew
I could install plenty of software, but I'd need to pick and choose
to some degree because the distributions I was looking at are
pretty large.</p><p>Because I'd tried it once before with an earlier InfoMagic
release, I decided to first install Slackware on my newly-unified
ext2fs partition. I figured I'd probably be able to get a full
system up and running in an hour or so. I wasn't disappointed. I
was able to put together a boot/rootdisk combination for my system
in about five or ten minutes, most of this time taken up by the
writing of the disk images to floppies. I popped in the boot
floppy, rebooted, and got down to business. Using the
<b  >colortty</b>
 rootdisk, I was greeted with nice looking color dialog boxes which
make the installation procedure look very professional.</p><p>Slackware's
<b  >setup</b>
 routine found the existing swap and ext2fs file systems on my SCSI
hard drive. I told it to ignore the ones I didn't want to touch
(the
<b  >/, /usr,</b>
 and
<b  >/usr/local</b>
 of my pre-existing system) and to use the new partition I had set
up as its root file system. My MS-DOS file systems were also found
and I added these to the file system table without a hitch, even
though I wanted them mounted as
<b  >/dos/c</b>
,
<b  >/dos/d</b>
, and
<b  >/dos/e</b>
 which is a bit out of the ordinary.</p><p>I then installed all of the packages I was interested in
(just about all of them) and rebooted. My system came up right away
and I was able to log in as
<b  >root</b>
 and add myself as a user to the system. One thing I noticed after
the installation was that my new partition was almost completely
full. I installed almost every package in the Slackware
distribution and was left with something shy of 10 MB free space on
my 185 MB partition. A minimal installation - no TeX, games,
etc.&mdash;would be a good deal smaller, but 185 MB is obviously not
quite enough room for the whole of Slackware to fit
comfortably.</p><p>One minor complaint I have about Slackware is its treatment
of manual pages. They are stored in compressed, pre-formatted form
(i.e. in
<b  >/var/catman</b>
 instead of
<b  >/usr/man</b>
), which saves disk space but limits your flexibility. I like
having the manual page sources around, so I can format the output
for viewing on a terminal, or an X display, or turn them into DVI
or PostScript files. With only the pre-formatted pages at your
disposal, you're stuck with ASCII (or ISO-8859-1) and a baroque
system whereby underlining is denoted by a combination of
underscores and backspaces interspersed between the characters.
Yuck. Because this installation went so easily and was so
trouble-free for me, I thought I should try out some other
distributions and compare them to what I felt was an extremely
polished and professional Slackware release. I didn't run it for
long, since I wanted to check out BOGUS too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2341580.0x2439ef8"></a>It's Not BOGUS</h2></div></div><p>Having read a bit about the BOGUS Linux distribution when it
was announced, I decided to try it out next. The BOGUS distribution
is maintained by Rik Faith, Doug Hoffman, and Kevin Martin and is
billed as hacker-centric system for experienced Linux users. The
BOGUS installation process requires more of a hands-on approach
than does the Slackware one, but the extra work involved is not
difficult and should come easily to anyone familiar with
administering Unix or Linux systems. The handy little QuickStart
guide is also a good tutorial for this sort of thing.</p><p>The README file for the BOGUS 1.0 distribution (additional
files and docs to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.0.1 are also on this disc)
is pretty short and doesn't do much hand holding. You're instructed
to partition your drive for root, swap, user, and some optional
partitions but not told how to do so. This might frighten away the
casual user but will have the hacker licking his or her chops. You
might also refer to the QuickStart guide as it provides an
excellent tutorial on the process. I would try it with my large
root partition and my pre-existing swap and see what happen.</p><p>After rebooting, I found the design of Kevin Martin's boot
floppies intriguing. As with most distributions, the boot disk
loads into a RAM disk so that it runs quickly and doesn't wear out
your floppy drive. The contents of the second floppy are also
loaded into the 4 MB RAM disk by typing
<b  >get_files</b>
 once the system has finished booting. Once the second disk has
been loaded, you've got everything you need to set up and install
your new system (or recover from a crash) and you're free to use
the floppy drive for other things. This isn't for low-end systems,
though, as the documentation says that 12 to 16 MB RAM are
required.</p><p>BOGUS relies heavily on a utility called
<b  >pms</b>
, Rik Faith's excellent Package Management System, to do most of
the installation work for the rest of the distribution. A script
called
<b  >/usr/src/install.all</b>
 is used to install the BOGUS packages on your system. This is
simply a shell script with a bunch of calls to
<b  >pms</b>
 in it.</p><p>The
<b  >pms</b>
 program looks for its package files in a directory called
<b  >/usr/src/DIST</b>
. Seeing as I was working with limited disk space, I decided to
fool BOGUS by pointing a symbolic link at the directory on the CD
containing the 1.0 distribution files and let the install script
chug away. It worked like a charm. The process ran to completion
but somewhere in one of the last couple of packages I had run out
of disk space. It turns out that the 185 MB I had budgeted is not
enough for a complete BOGUS distribution. Had I read all of the
documentation beforehand, I would have found that it requires about
205 MB in toto.</p><p>The packages which hadn't been installed were completely
non-essential (some X-based games as it turned out) so I wasn't too
worried. I did a bit of snooping around and found that
<b  >pms</b>
 keeps a log of all of the packages which have been installed in
the directory
<b  >/var/adm/pms</b>
. For each package there is a time stamp file with information
about when that package was installed. For the packages being
installed when my disk ran out of space, the timestamp files were
empty. When I figured this out, it was a simple matter of using
<b  >pms -d</b>
 to remove all traces of the semi-installed packages. I made even
more room by deleting more stuff I knew I wouldn't be using
(TeX-related, mostly).</p><p>The 1.0.1 release of BOGUS requires you either to install it
on top of an existing BOGUS-1.0 distribution or to overwrite
outdated package files in the distribution directory with their
newer counterparts before running
<b  >install.all</b>
. I realized I'd wasted time installing some of the packages from
1.0, but this was only after the installation was complete and I'd
done the cleanup described above.</p><p>Changing my symlink to point to the new packages in the
<b  >ADDITIONS</b>
 directory, I set about upgrading my new BOGUS-1.0 system to 1.0.1.
This was also done by means of a
<b  >pms</b>
 wrapper script and some direction from the README file. I had
freed up enough disk space earlier to allow the upgrade to go
smoothly without filling up my disk.</p><p>I now rebooted and was greeted with the BOGUS boot sequence.
For those keeping score at home, BOGUS seems to give a nod to the
BSD camp, particularly where the boot procedure is concerned. The
system start-up scripts are called
<b  >/etc/rc.*</b>
 instead of the
<b  >/etc/rc.d/*</b>
 you'll find most other places. The messages reminded me of Sun's
messages.</p><p>I found a minor bug:
<b  >/bin/passwd</b>
 wasn't setuid root. This meant that a normal user couldn't change
his or her password. BOGUS also seems to lack any batch commands
for adding users. I couldn't find any, but I might not have looked
in the right places. The
<b  >pms</b>
 tool is, in my opinion, excellent. It is used to build the system
binaries from the 95 MB of sources and patches, all of which are
available on the disc, and to install the resulting packages on
your system when it is done. A very impressive piece of
work.</p><p>Despite the Spartan nature of the installation instructions
and the lack of a nifty user interface, BOGUS is an extremely
full-featured and well-rounded distribution. The emphasis is
definitely on the software developer who has a powerful system and
not the casual user. Inasmuch as InfoMagic calls this a
&ldquo;Developer's Resource&rdquo;, I think there should be a wide audience for
BOGUS.</p></div></div>
