    A Linux port tour.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a22580.0x2b1a3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux isn't just for breakfast, er,
Intel, anymore. Everybody loves it and wants it on their favorite
processor: 680x0, Alpha, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC. That's good, because
it makes Linus happy, Linux better, life easier for Linux users,
keeps commercial OS vendors on their toes, and sells a lot of
hardware. It's good, too, because Linux ports to newer processor
technologies help ensure the continuing viability of our favorite
operating system. On the other hand, the ports could split
development and lead to bugs and confusion from too many code
streams. The changes necessary for portability could mean slower
Linuxes for everyone. To head off these problems, Linus and the
other porters are working together to take Linux beyond
itsIntel-processor-based beginnings.
</p><p>For those who are new to the Linux community, we should start
by explaining that there is a long-standing joke about &ldquo;virtual
beer&rdquo; in the Linux community. The &ldquo;Oxford Beer Trolls&rdquo; were
credited for having sent &ldquo;virtual beer&rdquo; (money with which to buy
beer, presumably) to Linus, and soon &ldquo;virtual beer&rdquo; meant any sort
of thanks or praise. Because the phrase has become common, puns on
(virtual) beer are commonplace among Linux users. Let's take a
flying tour of the virtual breweries, their plumbing, hydraulic
engineers and brew masters, and end with a quick tasting of the
product. Let's start with the recipe.
<a href="0063t1.html" target="_self">Table I</a> lists the ingredients for
each port and some notes on the process. You can see how far along
each batch is.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>cross-tools consist of at least a compiler and
   binary utilities (as, ar, ld) that produce executables for the new
   machine + operating system combination.</p></li><li><p>merged source refers to integration of the port
   with Linus' kernel source.</p></li><li><p>simulator is a program that pretends to be the new
   hardware so new executables can be run and debugged.</p></li><li><p>boot is the few hundred words of native assemble
   code that checks, and may set up the hardware before beginning to
   load the kernel. The port is done once that code stops
   changing.</p></li><li><p>kernel refers to the minimum operating software
   needed to start a user shell. It includes memory management,
   process scheduling, rudimentary device drivers and at least one
   file system.</p></li><li><p>runs shell includes the capability of running the
   basic Linux command line utilities.</p></li><li><p>native tools are the result of using the
   cross-tools to cross themselves to the new machine + OS.</p></li><li><p>SDK means the newly ported Linux can compile a
   working copy of itself from scratch, completely stand-alone.</p></li><li><p>user apps consist of text processing, e-mail,
   alternate shells and file systems, more device drivers, really a
   complete character-oriented Linux. In short, everything except
   X-Windows.</p></li><li><p>X-Windows adds a standard graphical user
   interface.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you examine the birthplace of each port, you may enjoy
keeping track of its relative ability to intoxicate. For virtual
brews, this is calibrated in BogoMips (Bogus Misleading Indication
of Processor Speed). Remember, this cannot be used to compare
different processors.</p><p>Note that the &ldquo;Mips&rdquo; along the left side of
<a href="0063t2.html" target="_self">Table II</a> refers to a RISC
processor family, not a measurement of speed. Now we'll check in at
each brewery to look around, meet the makers, and take the
temperature of the batches. We won't spend any time with the ix86
Linux you are all familiar with. Besides, it's not a port; it's the
original. On with the tour.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a22580.0x2b1ad98"></a>Name: Linux/68k</h2></div></div><p>Linux/68k is a port of Linux to Amiga and Atari 680x0

      distribution. The documentation is EXTREMELY sketchy and is mainly
      in the form of back-of-the-envelope notes. Linux/Alpha is not
      self-hosting; one must cross-compile the kernel and utilities on
      another system using the available cross-development tools. The
      kernel is extremely fragile, and several important code paths have
      not been tested yet. Very few utilities are available; you can
      bring the system up to a shell prompt, but you can't do much of
      anything else yet. Device driver support is minimal; currently, we
      support console-callback device drivers, but these are EXTREMELY
      slow (console-callback drivers are the Alpha equivalent of BIOS
      drivers on Intel systems). We have ported three sample drivers so
      far for the DEC 2000 AXP system: keyboard, text-mode VGA, and
      Adaptec 1742 SCSI.</p></li><li><p>In other words, Linux/Alpha is currently in a state

      Print boot-up messages, 2) Determine the machine type (sun4c,
      sun4m, sun4d, etc.), 3) Determine the available physical memory on
      the machine and other types of information, 4) Probe the OpenBoot
      PROM for devices that are on the machine. The PROM is a real win
      here.5) BogoMIPS, the most important part of the port! This SUN
      4/20 gives 17.94 BogoMIPS. 6) Completely map the kernel's virtual
      pages. 7) Enable and flush the Virtual Address Cache.</p></li><li><p>I have a lot of the architecture-dependent
      include/asm-sparc files written and am able to `make config; make
      dep; make clean' on the tree. A lot of the file system code can be
      compiled. Getting it to work is another story.</p></li><li><p>The current work on the Sparc port of Linux is
      aimed at the sun4c machines which are based on Version 7 of the
      Sparc architecture. The main difference (between machine types) is
      that the MMU's are accessed in a different fashion in V8 and
      onward. Fortunately, Version 8 memory management (for sun4m) is
      defined by the V8 manual &ldquo;The Sparc Reference MMU&rdquo;. I am attempting
      to make sun4m support easy to just plug in later. Yes, this means
      multi-processor support and all that entails. Although no such
      machines will exist before mid `95, I am doing some of my code with
      the Version 9 Sparc in mind: better prepared than not.</p></li><li><p>I have been trying to coordinate my code with Linus
