<span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;I'm not a huge fan of the LGPL, especially with the recent issues of
GPLv3. The reason? The LGPL is expressly designed to be compatible with
the GPL, but it's designed to be compatible with any version (and you
can't limit it, the way you can the real GPL).
So you can take LGPL 2.1 code, and relicense it under GPLv3, and make
changes to it, and those changes won't be available to a GPLv2
project.&rdquo;&mdash;Linus Torvalds</em></span>
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>sysctl call</b></span>, allowing users to configure kernel parameters at runtime,
is likely to go away. This goes against the standard doctrine of never
breaking user space, but the kernel folks may get away with it this time,
because it looks as though there are no user-space programs that actually
use sysctl. Apparently, people do their kernel configuration operations
in other ways. If you or someone you love depends on sysctl, you might
consider raising the issue on the linux-kernel mailing list while there's
still time. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> have both expressed the opinion
that taking sysctl out would be the right thing to do&mdash;Linus because no one
uses it and Andrew because it would be a shame to leave a big wad of such
useless code in the kernel permanently, if a viable alternative existed.
But,
in case it really would just break too much stuff, <span   class="bold"><b>Albert Cahalan</b></span> has
volunteered to be the official sysctl maintainer if one is needed.
</p><p>
The Multimedia Card subsystem is now the <span   class="bold"><b>Multimedia Card and Secure Digital
subsystem</b></span>, and <span   class="bold"><b>Pierre Ossman</b></span> has submitted a patch making himself the new
maintainer. <span   class="bold"><b>Russell King</b></span>, the previous maintainer, had stepped down and
marked the subsystem &ldquo;orphaned&rdquo;. Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>Jiri Slaby</b></span> has added new
maintainer entries for the <span   class="bold"><b>Moxa SmartIO/IndustIO
Serial Card driver</b></span> and the
<span   class="bold"><b>Multitech Multiport Card driver</b></span>, in both cases naming himself as the
official maintainer.
</p><p>
An anonymous kernel tester has reported some benchmarks showing that
<span   class="bold"><b>ext4</b></span> is
about 20% faster than either ext3 or Reiser4. Although a useful (and perhaps
gratifying) result, <span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Ts'o</b></span> pointed out that what was really needed
was an automated testing infrastructure, so that each version of each
filesystem could be compared, and the particular results correlated to the
specific patch that either sped things up or slowed things down. And, various
other folks suggested incorporating tests for other filesystems as well. The
original poster agreed that this would be great, but he or she (and Ted)
also pointed out that the amount of work required to create such an
infrastructure would be massively big. It does not look as though an
automated filesystem benchmark is coming any time soon, though you never
know.
</p><p>
It's apparently <span   class="bold"><b>wiki season</b></span> in kernel
land. <span   class="bold"><b>Valerie Henson</b></span> has created two
wikis, one for filesystems at <a href="http://linuxfs.pbwiki.com" target="_self">linuxfs.pbwiki.com</a> and the other for
huge memory pages at <a href="http://linux-mm.org/HugePages" target="_self">linux-mm.org/HugePages</a>. As one might expect, the
filesystem wiki is a bit more active than the huge pages wiki. To go along
with these collaborative projects, Valerie has also started up two
<span   class="bold"><b>IRC
channels</b></span> on irc.oftc.net: #linuxfs and #hugepages. Meanwhile,
<span   class="bold"><b>Darren Hart</b></span>
and Theodore Ts'o have started up a wiki for real-time support at
<a href="http://rt.wiki.kernel.org" target="_self">rt.wiki.kernel.org</a>, and in fact, the generic wiki.kernel.org site may
offer generic wiki hosting services to any legitimate kernel project. Just
ask the site administrators to set it up for you! At the same time, as Ted
points out, you should make sure there is at least a person or two to act as
editor and maintainer, or your wiki is likely to become stale. Nothing like
stale wiki to clear the sinuses, I say!

<h2 class="title">LAMP Gets a J</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #154, February 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

You can't add the letter J to LAMP and spell anything sensible. So, some took to
calling Linux &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; with Java &ldquo;LAMJ&rdquo;,
&ldquo;LAMPJ&rdquo; or &ldquo;LAMP-J&rdquo;. But they
never seemed legitimate&mdash;not so long as Java didn't have an open-source
license that passed muster with the rest of the L+ alphabet.
</p><p>
That changed on November 13, 2006 (as we go to press here), when Sun finally
announced that it would be releasing Java under the GPL&mdash;specifically
under version 2, which is the license Linux has used since it came out and
has stuck with (at Linus' insistence), even after version 3 was announced
last year.
</p><p>
Sun has hinted for some time that it would go with the GPL for Java.
Jonathan Schwartz, the company's CEO, hinted as much in a conversation I
had with him on stage at the Syndicate conference in December 2005. Now Jim
Thompson has another intriguing question: &ldquo;Is Solaris going to be the
original GPLv3 *nix platform?&rdquo;
</p><p>
In his blog, Jonathan writes, &ldquo;The GPL is the same license used to manage
the evolution of GNU/Linux&mdash;in choosing the GPL, we've opened the door to
comingling the communities, and the code itself. (And yes, we picked GPL
version 2&mdash;version 3 isn't available, but we like where the FSF is
headed.)&rdquo;
</p><p>
Whether or not Solaris and the FSF arrive at the same place, Jim has one
more question: &ldquo;What are the chances that Ubuntu would offer a version of
its distro with a GPL-ed Solaris kernel underneath?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Redraw your own conclusions.

<h2 class="title">The Almost Inevitable Migration for All</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #154, February 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

This <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue is about migration, but migration means many
things to many people. Few companies and even few homes use only one
operating system.
</p><p>
A lot of Linux advocates use Apple notebooks running OS X, a BSD
derivative. Many of these Linux advocates use iPods or BlackBerrys. Many
are forced to use Windows systems due to work pressures.
</p><p>
Likewise, a certain company in Redmond, Washington, often talks about the
&ldquo;cost&rdquo; of migrating to Linux from its own operating system, and uses this
&ldquo;cost&rdquo; to boost the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of our favorite
operating system and design strategy of Free Software, without acknowledging
the higher value of end users having control over their own destinies.
</p><p>
This same company also ignores the fact that it has forced more
&ldquo;migrations&rdquo; over the years by making its customers move from DOS to
Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows 2000
and Win ME and are now looking for an
even greater migration to the 64-bit Vista. Although we can hope that this
company has learned from all of the other 64-bit operating systems and
their migration issues (Linux moved to 64-bit in 1995), we can assume that
there will be some hiccups along the way. And, this seems to be borne out
in the stages and delays that have come along with Vista (probably one of the most
&ldquo;beta-ed&rdquo; of
all operating systems), with cautions to companies from
the producers of Vista to &ldquo;test, test, test&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Therefore, in reality, migration is really integration, unless you are
lucky enough to be able to start from scratch with a one-operating-system
strategy and maintain it throughout time. I call this the one-egg, one-basket mentality, and to do it with an operating system that you have zero
control over is just plain suicide.
</p><p>
So, when I talk to people about migrating to Linux, I work on several
levels. I tell them first to do &ldquo;the easy stuff&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The first part of moving to a Free Software strategy in your environment is
to start getting used to Free Software while you analyze your needs. Note
that I do not differentiate between personal use or corporate use when I
say &ldquo;analyze your needs&rdquo;, because in reality, the procedure is the same for
both. Only the size and complexity of the
project may differ.
</p><p>
First, start to learn about Free Software. Go to your local
bookstore, go to the operating system section, pick out a few books, go to
the coffee shop that is attached to the bookstore and look through the
selections for the one or two books that can help you get started in Free
Software.
</p><p>
Ask around your development group or your local university to see whether there
is a Linux User Group near you, and sign up for the mailing list. Do not
worry if you are a newbie to the list. Simply read the list, look
at the archives, and if someone asks you a question, just look wise and
say,
&ldquo;Yes, I will go along with that.&rdquo;
</p><p>
While you are learning about Free Software, look into the objectives of
organizations like the Free Standards Group (FSG) and the Linux Professional
Institute (LPI). The FSG talks about the importance of written standards and
how to ensure that you are not locked into a specific version of any
distribution of Free Software, and the LPI tells you the breadth of information
your system administrators will need to know to maintain
your Free Software operating systems.
</p><p>
Other organizations to investigate are the Free Software Foundation, the
Open
Source Initiative and other community organizations, to get a better idea
of what Free Software is all about.
</p><p>
Next, list your activities and needs. Do not say, &ldquo;I need
brand-name this and brand-name that.&rdquo; Instead, list the needs as
more generic things. For example, &ldquo;I need a word processor, but I do not need a
presentation package.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I need a database, but it does not have to be
relational.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I need a database, and it needs to be
object-oriented.&rdquo;
If you start listing your needs on a generic basis, you may find you
can deal with a much simpler, lighter-weight solution than you originally
imagined. You also may find that this solution fits a smaller system with
less memory and CPU needs.
</p><p>
And, you also may find that certain parts of your organization or home have
different needs than other parts do. You then can make a decision to use a
more focused solution for one particular need or a more general solution
for all of the other needs.
</p><p>
While you are focusing on determining the needs of the solutions,
make sure you evaluate future growth and things like security,
availability and scalability.
</p><p>
In addition, as you start to think about future needs, consider hiring a
Free Software developer or a system administrator that is familiar with
Free Software. All other things being equal, Free Software people will
be easier for ensuring quality (due to the openness of the source code used in their
projects, the mailing-list entries and so forth) and also will help generate
community interest that might leverage your company's solutions.
</p><p>
A friend of mine who was a system administrator for a large company was
also a Free Software person. Every day he would write Free Software to
help him do his job, and every night he would go home, sit beside his
spouse on the couch, and while she watched TV, he would write additional
code and submit it to the source pool. The next day, he would go in and
find that a lot of other people were doing the same thing. His comment to
me was: &ldquo;maddog, it is like speaking into a megaphone....I say so little
and I get back so much.&rdquo;
</p><p>
[Just to show that I am not chauvinistic in this case, I'd like to point out
that there are female system administrators who go home and sit beside
their husbands and code while their husbands watch TV.]
</p><p>
After you have determined your needs, you now can start to think about
alternatives in cost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It is not without reason that some of the first uses of Free Software
were
in the use of generalized appliances&mdash;machines and systems that end
users did not see or care what the operating systems were, as long as
they were
stable, scalable, secure and inexpensive. These appliances manifested
themselves in DNS servers, firewalls, routers, Web servers and
file-and-print servers.
</p><p>
Why should people put a DNS server on the same machine as their
highly tuned, high-performance hardware database machine? Why not split
that functionality off to a smaller, less-expensive (and perhaps older) dedicated system? Even if you are a virtualization fan, the
idea of using a different partition for your DNS server allows for
separation of function, which in turn may allow for greater stability
between components.
</p><p>
People setting up Web server farms quickly learned that their customers
could not tell the difference between a highly expensive proprietary system
serving up Web pages from a much less expensive commodity hardware
solution running Free Software, other than the fact that the
price/performance was better, and therefore, allowed for more machine power
and greater overall reliability.
</p><p>
Database companies were able to sell a total solution to their customers
using a free operating system running on less expensive hardware, and
end-user client programs could not tell the difference in data coming
over the Internet.
</p><p>
Of course, there are also database solutions that are recognized to be Free
Software in and of themselves. MySQL and PostgreSQL are two of them.
Being careful to utilize standard interfaces and commands gives you the
most freedom when using any of the database products or projects.
</p><p>
File-and-print servers could be set up that supported not only Windows
clients, but Apple clients, UNIX clients and Linux clients with the same
server at the same time, invisible to the end user.
</p><p>
A large health company in Australia was interviewed in 1996 about whether
it used Free Software. The interviewee was told &ldquo;No&rdquo; by
the CIO, that the company did &ldquo;important things&rdquo; and would not use
&ldquo;hobbyist software&rdquo; to do them. Unfortunately for that CIO,
his staff members had
been told to use Windows NT for a file-and-print server, and after failing a
number of times (and experiencing his wrath), they turned to a Free
Software operating system, and by that time had been using it for six
months. When asked when they were going to tell their CIO that they had
been using &ldquo;hobbyist software&rdquo; to do &ldquo;important
things&rdquo;, they estimated
that &ldquo;another six months of flawless operation&rdquo; would do the trick.
</p><p>
This explains why reports from analyst companies had a &ldquo;step
function&rdquo; in
Free Software usage in the 1998&ndash;2000 era. The analysts stopped surveying
CIOs and started talking to system administrators, who actually were
implementing the solutions with Free Software. When the system
administrators confessed to using Free Software, the charts produced by
analysts showed drastic change.
</p><p>
In all of these areas, Free Software is mostly or totally invisible to
the real end user (including home end users), and at most it requires
training of system administrators to configure and set up the systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Another area where Free Software can be used is on the already-existing
desktop.
Again, if you list the functionality needed for the &ldquo;job&rdquo;, instead of brand
names, often a more robust solution appears.
</p><p>
An obvious solution is &ldquo;Web browser&rdquo; rather than Internet
Explorer. Various Web browsers exist in the Free Software community, and each has its own
advantages. Some are smaller and easier to embed. Some use less eye
candy and are easier to use on the small screen (or leave more
real estate for other applications on the larger screen). Some are more
portable across various operating systems, so if your people are moving
from one system (OS X to Windows, for
example) you may want to use a browser that works well in many
environments.
</p><p>
Other areas of upper-level compatability are things like word processors.
For the most part, I use OpenOffice.org. It works on all the
operating systems that I would have wanted to use in the past ten years:
Windows, Linux (including Alpha Linux), Solaris and FreeBSD.
</p><p>
I often questioned why someone would want to use an office system that
ran on only one operating system, or even two? I found it difficult to live
with needing two operating systems on my desk&mdash;one to do my work and one to
communicate with my management and sales staff. Today, I need only
one system on my desk, because my solutions run across multiple operating
systems.
</p><p>
Many Free Software solutions run on multiple operating systems. The GNU
compilers, for instance, have been providing programmers with an excellent
set of tools for more than 20 years. They have allowed programmers to
concentrate on the basic algorithm without having to worry about the
incompatibilities of syntax and semantics that can occur across compilers
written by different organizations and for different hardware
architectures. It is true that some commercial companies do the same
things with their very excellent commercial compilers. This provides the end
user with customer choice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
So far, I have been talking about everything but the cold-turkey
movement from a proprietary solution to a Free Software solution. Now I am
going to say something that will (I am sure) surprise a lot of Free
Software people.
</p><p>
If you have a solution that is working fine for you, is incredibly stable,
has no bugs, is reasonable in price, is from a solid company that is not
looking to change its products radically (thus causing migration problems of
its own), comes from responsive vendors and all of your end users
(including you) are happy with it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>please do not change
it</em></span>. This is what I
call the &ldquo;All Pain, No Gain&rdquo; migration. Even in the best cases,
everyone will ask you, &ldquo;Why did we do this?&rdquo; In the worst cases, the
migration will fail, you will be the goat, and your choice of Free Software
will be held to blame.
</p><p>
Instead, look for new projects, or large projects using expensive hardware
or software, or projects for which the software is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> fulfilling their needs.
This is where Free Software tends to be the most flexible and
cost-effective solution. For new projects, the training costs are
typically the same. There will be training costs for either
proprietary software or Free Software, and this typically is not as much
of a
differentiator as it would be with re-training.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Down through the ages in computing we have moved from giant, single-program
machines to giant, multitasking machines to smaller, single-tasking
mini-computers to multitasking mini-computers to smaller, single-tasking
micro-computers to multitasking micro-computers and so forth, while still
maintaining a lot of the older, &ldquo;larger&rdquo; computers. We also
have moved
from single mainframes to time-sharing systems to distributed
systems and back again. In my view, what people really want is a
time-sharing system of unlimited size and power, with very secure virtual
firewalls, which can be available 25x8 (not just 24x7), and where backup and
recovery are done automatically and with someone else's money.
</p><p>
With the advent of the World Wide Web, a lot of applications now are going
to be browser-based, with the applications and data (for the most part)
residing on a back-office server. This promises an ease of system
administration and security that are hard to supply with the pure
distributed model.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) solves a lot of the
hard logistics of setting up a &ldquo;thick and thin client&rdquo;
system. Although the
costs of a modern-day desktop system reduce the need to squeeze every cent
you can out of old hardware as desktop thin clients, it is still true that
fat clients continue to expand in system resource needs while thin clients
grow much more slowly, and are more stingy with desktop resources. It is
also true that although hardware and networking have been increasing in
capabilities over the years while prices have been dropping, the number of
well-trained system administrators has not been keeping up, so a better
model for end-user software configuration is needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You can go several places to look for applications that meet
your needs.
</p><p>
First, determine whether any of the applications you currently use and
appreciate have gone &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo;. Many proprietary products now work
on a free operating system or have developed a Free Software strategy,
opening up their code and licensing while increasing their market share and
support revenue. A very good example of this is Project.net
(<a href="http://www.project.net" target="_self">www.project.net</a>), whose current owner, ICS, determined that making his
project freely available and opening up the source code was the best way of
doing business.
</p><p>
Other software may be developed directly from projects being listed on
repositories, such as <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_self">www.sourceforge.net</a> and

repositories not only list the code and installation procedures, but also

Finally, custom applications are not as expensive or difficult to build
today as they were a few years ago. Using modern-day middleware, libraries
of Free Software code and Web-based applications, you may find that
developing an application tailored to your needs is a small investment
compared to using an off-the-shelf application that requires you to change
the way you do business to fit the application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In some cases, stubborn applications keep people from moving
to the environment they desire. Some of these applications are needed
infrequently and may be handled by a dual-booting system or by running a
product, such as WMware (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_self">www.vmware.com</a>) or Win4Lin
(<a href="http://www.win4lin.com" target="_self">www.win4lin.com</a>), to allow
you to run the applications simultaneously, albeit at a very slight
performance hit.
</p><p>
Another great option is CodeWeavers' CrossOver products (<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com" target="_self">www.codeweavers.com</a>), now also available for the Intel OS X systems. CodeWeavers is
based on the freely available Wine Project, and the parent company has been
helpful in extending and expanding Wine's capabilities for many years.

Although I have heard of migrations that have gone cold turkey
(turning off one system while turning the other on) successfully, I have
heard of many more that failed. Nothing takes the place of a good
transition strategy when going from an old system to a new one. Parallel
running of the two systems is best, along with testing to see whether archived
data is still available on the new systems.
</p><p>
Another good trick is to get the most enthusiastic office workers
involved early and make sure that they have a good experience as they
migrate over to the new tools. Every office
has people like this. They buy the latest and greatest gadgets and are openly
receptive to new things. Once they are enthusiastic about
the new system, they often can help move other people over.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Do not be afraid to think outside of the box. I met a man with very old
legacy code that was working well on very old hardware. He was concerned
that the very old hardware was becoming more and more difficult to replace, and
wanted to port it to Linux. I told him that although porting was a
possibility, I would just run a hardware emulator for that hardware on top
of Linux and use that to support his applications and customers
&ldquo;forever&rdquo;.
He looked at me strangely, smiled, and walked away.
</p><p>
Likewise there are Free Software DOS emulators will allow DOS
applications &ldquo;forever&rdquo;, and modern-day CPU speeds sometimes make these
applications run blazingly fast.
</p><p>
Use portable languages like Perl, Python and others to make your
applications run on as many systems as possible.
</p><p>
Finally, when your system works well, evangelize what you have done. Write
a paper about it, talk to your local Linux User Group, give a talk at
LinuxWorld or write an article for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. After all, probably a
hundred or more other people are exactly where you are today and would
like to have more freedom in their software.

<h2 class="title">A White Box Phone</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #154, February 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

As we know too well, embedding Linux in a device doesn't make it
&ldquo;open&rdquo;.
And although there are open Linux-based embedded devices, telephones fitting
that description have been rare.

</p><p>
The OpenMoko phone aims to change that (<a href="http://openmoko.com" target="_self">openmoko.com</a>). Funambol (pronounced
foo-<span   class="bold"><b>nahm</b></span>-ball), a Taiwan-based manufacturer whose official ambition is
&ldquo;to bring the customer benefits of open source software to the $300 billion
global mobile market&rdquo;, launched OpenMoko to generally positive reviews.
From my own contact list, these ranged from Gordon Cook's (<a href="http://gordoncook.net" target="_self">gordoncook.net</a>) &ldquo;This is AMAZING
STUFF&rdquo; (in fact, I heard about it first from Gordon) to Bob
Frankston's (<a href="http://frankston.com" target="_self">frankston.com</a>) &ldquo;No
Wi-Fi? Huh?&rdquo; and &ldquo;As I've discovered with my current programmable phone,
having Wi-Fi and GPS can make a big difference.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But the quotage that matters most comes from Harald Welte, who wrote this
in his blog at gnumonks.org (<a href="http://gnumonks.org/~laforge/weblog/2006/11/08/#20061108-my_no_longer_secret_project" target="_self">gnumonks.org/~laforge/weblog/2006/11/08/#20061108-my_no_longer_secret_project</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In this project I'm responsible for the system-level software design
and implementation. This means: kernel, drivers, GSM communication
infrastructure, etc.
</p><p>
So why is this project so exciting? Because it's [yet another] Linux
phone? No. It's because this is the first time (to the best of my
knowledge), that a vendor is:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
involving (hiring) prominent community members to do the actual
architecture design and implementation;
</p></li><li><p>
planning to completely open up their Linux distribution for any
contributed development, e.g. use a package manager that can
access arbitrary package feeds;
</p></li><li><p>
trying very hard to make sure almost everything will be Free
Software, from drivers up to the UI applications;
</p></li><li><p>
actively providing documentation and interfaces for third-party
development on any level of the system, from debug interface,
boot loader, kernel, middleware through the UI applications;
</p></li><li><p>
using X11 to allow users to run any existing X11 Linux
application (within resource constraints).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So basically, from a Free Software community level, this is exactly the
kind of phone you want to get involved with, and play with. Yes, it's not
the perfect phone. It runs a proprietary GSM stack on a separate processor.
There are some minor, self-contained proprietary bits on the back end side
in userspace. But well, it's probably the best you can do as a first shot
of a new generation of devices, and without too much existing market power
to put on upstream vendors.

Beats anything you'll ever read in a press release.
</p><p>
I'll give the last word to Brad Fitzpatrick (<a href="http://brad.livejournal.com" target="_self">brad.livejournal.com</a>), father of LiveJournal OpenID,
memcached and other fine hacks. After news of OpenMoko hit the streets,
Brad wrote, &ldquo;On sale Jan 2007...I'm totally getting one&rdquo;.

Coding up the simplest thing that could possibly work is really about this:
If you can't keep five things in your head at one time and make a decision,
try keeping three things in your head. Try keeping just one thing in your
head, and see if you can make a decision. Then you can think of the next
thing. And amazingly, when you write some of this dumb, straight-ahead
code, it often turns out that it was all that was required. It works great.
When a second programmer comes back later and reads the code she might say,
&ldquo;The people who wrote this are morons. They just wrote a simple linear
search here. This thing's ordered, so they could have done a binary search.
They could have used a hash table here. Why are they doing a linear
search?&rdquo; Well, because a linear search worked. And when the other
programmer looked at the linear search, she understood it in a minute.
