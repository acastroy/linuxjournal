Exploit udev rules to back up your Flash drive daily or every time you
insert it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Raise your hand if you've ever lost (or worried you'd lost) a USB thumbdrive.  You spent hours fruitlessly searching the house, and then as you
opened the washing machine door, it suddenly dawned on you that perhaps
you didn't check your pockets thoroughly when you put this load in.
</p><p>
Fortunately, you have a backup of all the data, right? You religiously
mount the drive and copy the data to a backup directory on a regular
schedule, no?
</p><p>
That sounds an awful lot like drudgery to me too, and I got into
computers to avoid boring work.  Naturally, it's a lot more fun to
spend some time working out the perfect method for painless thumbdrive
backups.
</p><p>
What do I mean by painless? How about a system where you can walk up
to your Linux box, plug in the drive, wait for a &ldquo;backup
complete&rdquo; sound,
unplug and walk away? Perhaps a system that keeps its backups orderly
(say, the last seven copies)? Oh, and it should handle encrypted
thumbdrives as well.  And, if you need to recover, it should do both whole-volume replacement and per-file restores.
</p><p>
Not a problem.  The key to this system is using udev rules and a simple
shell script.  The tools already are on your system.  In this example,
I use a CentOS 4.3 system, though any Linux distribution with
a 2.6 kernel should work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a558"></a>
udev to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
udev is the modern device manager for Linux, replacing the 2.4 kernel's
devfs.  udev handles all device mapping, including hot plugging of
devices.  One of its coolest features is it lets you write your own
event rules.  This article shows you how to craft a rule that automatically fires when you plug
your USB thumbdrive in to the system.
</p><p>
These rules are stored in /etc/udev/rules.d (if you're using a different
Linux distribution, check /etc/udev/udev.conf for the udev_rules= line,
which should point to the rules directory).  You can place whatever udev
rules you want as text files in this directory, and udev picks them up
immediately for use without requiring a reboot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173a6b8"></a>
How to Identify Your Device</h2></div></div><p>
To write a udev event rule, you first need a unique way to identify
the USB device.  Most thumbdrives have serial numbers, though not
all.  Fortunately, even with thumbdrives that do not have a serial number,
you can craft udev rules for them.
</p><p>
I use two thumbdrives as examples: a JetFlash JF110, encrypted
with TrueCrypt, and a Corsair Flash Voyager.  The JetFlash has a serial
number; the Corsair does not.
</p><p>
Plug your thumbdrive in, and <tt  >cat
/proc/scsi/usb-storage/*</tt>.  You should
find an entry for it similar to this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   Host scsi5: usb-storage
       Vendor: Unknown
      Product: USB Mass Storage Device
Serial Number: 85a5b1f2c96492
     Protocol: Transparent SCSI
    Transport: Bulk
       Quirks:
</pre><p>
If you have a serial number, skip forward to the &ldquo;Writing the
Rule&rdquo; section of this article.  If you
see &ldquo;None&rdquo; for the Serial Number, you still can identify the device by
using udevinfo.  Follow these steps:
</p><p>
1) Look at dmesg's output.  Typical output is as follows:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
  Vendor: Corsair   Model: Flash Voyager     Rev: 1.00
  Type:   Direct-Access
  ANSI SCSI SCSI device sde: 2031616 512-byte hdwr sectors (1040 MB)
[...]
sde: assuming drive cache: write through
 sde: sde1
Attached scsi removable disk sde at scsi12, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Attached scsi generic sg4 at scsi12, channel 0, id 0, lun 0,  type 0</pre><p>
This tells you that /dev/sde is the device assigned.
</p><p>
2) Now, run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">udevinfo -a -p $(udevinfo -q path -n /dev/sde)</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173abe0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and examine the output.  Look for these lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">BUS=="scsi"
SYSFS{model}=="Flash Voyager  "
SYSFS{vendor}=="Corsair "</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173ad40"></a>
Writing the Rule</h2></div></div><p>
Now, with either the serial number or the vendor/model combo, you can
write the rule.  The rule creates a symlink for the device in
the /dev tree, for example, /dev/corsair_drive, and then calls the script
/usr/local/bin/backup-thumb.sh, which I'll get to in a moment.
</p><p>
Become root (<tt  >su -</tt>), and create a text file in /etc/udev/rules.d
called 95.backup.rules.  You can use a number other than 95, but
keep in mind that udev processes rules in alphanumeric order, and it's
better to have local rules processed last.
</p><p>
If you have a serial number, type a rule like this (all on one line)
into the file, and save it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">BUS="usb", SYSFS{serial}="85a5b1f2c96492", SYMLINK="jet_drive",
RUN+="/usr/local/bin/backup-thumb.sh jet_drive "</pre><p>
If you're using vendor/model identification, your rule would look
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">BUS="scsi", SYSFS{vendor}=="Corsair ", SYSFS{model}=="Flash Voyager  ",
SYMLINK="corsair_drive", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/backup-thumb.sh
corsair_drive"</pre><p>
Note that you can string as many SYSFS{} entries together as you need
to identify the drive uniquely.  Your rule now fires every time you
plug in your thumbdrive.
</p><p>
Note: if you have other rules for a device, udev executes the
rules in sequence from top to bottom.

Set Up the Backup Script</h2></div></div><p>
backup-thumb.sh is the engine that backs up your thumbdrive.  Our rule
calls it, giving the name of the device (the SYMLINK) as its only
argument.  Everything else is configured in the CONFIG section.
The backup script is shown in Listing 1.

Put this script in /usr/local/bin/backup-thumb.sh, and remember to
<tt  >chmod +x</tt> it.  Next, edit the CONFIG section&mdash;the parameters
are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
BACKUP_DIR: where you want the backups to go.
</p></li><li><p>
GENERATIONS: how many days of backups to keep.  Backups will be numbered
0 (most recent) to the limit you enter (oldest).  Keep in mind that you
need to have enough storage space for this many backups.  If you
are backing up a 1GB fob and set GENERATIONS to 7, backups will consume
7GB of space.
</p></li><li><p>
BACKUP_ONCE_DAY: if you plug and unplug your fob multiple times a day,
you probably won't want to back it up each time.  backup-thumb.sh
uses a tag file so that it backs up only once per day.  If you want to
change this so it runs a backup every time you plug in a thumbdrive,
set BACKUP_ONCE_DAY to 0.
</p></li><li><p>
SOUND: in this example, I've chosen a sound from the KDE distribution,
but any WAV file will work.  You easily can modify the script to
use madplay instead of aplay and use an MP3 file as your completion sound.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173b7e8"></a>
How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
backup-thumb.sh sleeps for ten seconds on startup, because it must wait
for the kernel to finish scanning the thumbdrive.  If you plug in a
thumbdrive and type <tt  >dmesg</tt>, you'll see a
&ldquo;waiting for device to settle&rdquo;
message while this happens.  Ten seconds for the kernel scan should be
sufficient even for older machines.
</p><p>
Next, backup-thumb.sh sets permissions tightly so that only root can
read the backups.  Otherwise, some nefarious person could copy your backup
to a different machine and mount it there.
</p><p>
The script executes a simple dd (bit-for-bit copy) of your thumbdrive to a backup file.  This works whether the device is encrypted
or not.  When it's finished, it plays a noise you will hear on your
computer's speakers.  On a USB 2.0 port, backing up a 1GB thumbdrive
takes about one minute.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1642580.0x173ba50"></a>
How to Recover</h2></div></div><p>
If you lose your thumbdrive and want to restore your backup to its
replacement, simply dd the backup image to the new thumbdrive, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">dd if=corsair_drive.backup.0 of=/dev/corsair_drive</pre><p>
Or, if you want to grab only some files from the backup, do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">mkdir /mnt/thumb
mount -o loop corsair_drive.backup.0 /mnt/thumb</pre><p>
You now can copy the files from /mnt/thumb.
</p><p>
If you're using TrueCrypt to encrypt your thumbdrive, you can mount
the backup image in much the same way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">truecrypt corsair_drive.backup.0 /mnt/thumb/</pre><p>
That's about as painless as we can make thumbdrive backups.  If you're
too lazy to plug your drive in and come back when it beeps...well,
stay away from laundromats!

This article has scratched only the surface of what you can do with
udev rules.  Any type of hot-plug event can fire a rule that can do
almost anything.  For example, you can write rules to mount devices
automatically, copy pictures off a digital camera or set up a network
link.  udev's rules language provides great flexibility, including
printf-like wild cards and the ability to set permissions.
</p><p>
The best overview for writing your own udev rules is
