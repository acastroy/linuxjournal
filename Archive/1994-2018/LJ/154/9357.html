Microsoft Exchange, Meet Your Replacement
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The time has come to consider moving that expensive,
high-maintenance Windows system to a sleeker, more robust
Linux system.  The gap analyses have been done, the meetings held,
the presentations complete, and now it's go time.  Although installing
and configuring a Linux server back end can be challenging, we all
know that users aren't going to care about that.  What they want is
uninterrupted functionality so they can continue doing their jobs.
Although
migrating users from applications such as Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org is
generally an intuitive task, the 800-pound gorilla that's keeping you up
at night is e-mail and groupware. How are you going to provide and manage
Microsoft Outlook-like functionality to the masses? In a word, Citadel.
</p><p>
One of the understated wonders of the Free and Open Source Software
world is the Citadel Groupware Server (<a href="http://www.citadel.org" target="_self">www.citadel.org</a>).  Controlled by a single
developer, Citadel started life in 1987 as a UNIX version of the
already-existing Citadel-CP/M application.  Almost 20 years later, the
modern-day
Citadel boasts all of the functionality of a mature groupware server.  One
of the miracles that Citadel can perform is providing all of the most-used
functionality of Microsoft Exchange with little fuss and and even less
cost.
</p><p>
Many modern organizations are coming to the realization that their IT
budget is largely controlled by Microsoft's licensing fees and hardware
requirements.  Although organizations can prepare for some of these costs,
many are looking at Vista with trepidation.  Although the
hardware requirements for Vista aren't obscenely over the top, many
organizations still will need to upgrade their hardware in order to run
it.  And, sooner or later, run it they will.  The hardware upgrade cycle
is a never-ending source of pain for some organizations, because not only
do servers and server software need to be upgraded on a somewhat regular
basis, but untold numbers of workstations also need attention.
</p><p>
Depending on the size of your organization, your Microsoft Exchange
server might be the most robust server in the closet, and finding a
suitable replacement for Exchange is quite often a show-stopper.  Citadel
is a groupware solution that allows organizations not only to avoid
upgrading software, but it also runs on a significantly lower-powered
machine, thus breaking the hardware upgrade cycle for years to come.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7500"></a>
How to Get It</h2></div></div><p>
It's always good practice to install and test everything on a test
server before moving it into a production environment.  Swapping out your
mail server is certainly no different, and you should keep your Citadel
testing as far away from your production system as possible.  Obtaining
and configuring Citadel is several orders of magnitude easier with
an Internet-connected server, however, because you can avail yourself
of the Easy Installation process.
</p><p>
   As of this writing, the most current version of Citadel is 6.84.  I highly
recommend a trip by the Citadel site in order to obtain the most current
version of the server and the most current version of the installation
instructions.  Our testing environment consisted of Debian Sarge with
a 2.6 kernel running in VMware Player 1.0.2.  For no particular reason,
we selected the Web server installation option, but virtually any
installation category should work, as Citadel installs everything it
needs.  In the past, we have installed and run Citadel on a Debian Sarge
server proper, and in both cases the installation was flawless.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7660"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
I cover the Easy Installation method here not only because
it's easy, but it's also fairly undemanding on resources and therefore quite
likely that anyone can make use of it.  Just about the only requirement for
the Easy Installation method is a working&mdash;and preferably
fast&mdash;Internet
connection.
</p><p>
The Easy Installation method requires the toolchain, or build environment,
to be present on the target platform.  In addition, curl (or wget) is
required.  If you'd like to support SSL connections to the server,
you also need libssl-dev.  On a Debian system, use the following
command to install or verify your build environment:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">apt-get install build-essential curl libssl-dev</pre><p>
Before installing, it is worth noting that Citadel is designed as
a black box system running on your server.  Part of that black box
means that Citadel authenticates logins against its own user database
and not against your system user database (typically /etc/passwd).  If
you'd like Citadel to authenticate against your system user database,
you must export the IS_AUTOLOGIN variable to the environment prior to
running the Citadel install, like so:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">export IS_AUTOLOGIN=yes</pre><p>
Now that the environment is set, it's time to kick off the Easy Install
with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">curl http://easyinstall.citadel.org/install | sh</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or, if you'd prefer to use wget:</p><pre     class="programlisting">wget -q -O - http://easyinstall.citadel.org/install | sh</pre><p>
Citadel downloads, unpacks and starts the installation process.  You
need to pay attention to the installation process, as Citadel asks all
the right questions, but you won't need any of your arcane configuration
logs to answer them.
</p><p>
Citadel is humble, and although it brings a lot of power to the party, it
doesn't assume that you want any of it.  Citadel will ask
if you want to use its built-in POP, SMTP or IMAP servers or leave any
of your own up and running.
</p><p>
Further, there is a Web interface, called WebCit, which users can make
use of to get all of their e-mail, calendar and contact information
when on the road or otherwise away from their local e-mail and Personal
Information Manager client.  If you elect to install WebCit, Citadel won't
assume that you want it running on port 80.  It therefore is possible to
run WebCit on a nonstandard port and leave any existing Web sites you
have on port 80 undisturbed.
</p><p>
For the curious, Citadel is installed to /usr/local/citadel,
and WebCit, if chosen for installation, is installed
in /usr/local/webcit.  Supporting libraries can be found in
/usr/local/ctdlsupport.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7c38"></a>
Uninstallation</h2></div></div><p>
Uninstalling a Citadel instance installed via the Easy Install method
is easy:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Delete the three directories mentioned above
(/usr/local/webcit, usr/local/citadel and /usr/local/ctdlsupport).
</p></li><li><p>
Remove the Citadel and WebCit entries from the inittab file (typically
/etc/inittab).
</p></li><li><p>
Type the command <tt  >init q</tt> to restart init.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Gone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e8058"></a>
Initial Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
We used the WebCit Web interface to configure and use our Citadel
server, but underneath the nice GUI beats the heart of a text-mode
BBS.  Virtually all of the configuration and much of the daily use
of the Citadel system can be used via the text mode Citadel client &aacute;la
the BBS scene of days gone by.  Sadly, that method of communication is
largely lost to most modern-day users, so we focus only on
WebCit to get the job done.
</p><p>
Having said that, we still need to log in to our Linux server for other
reasons, so we have to change the way that Citadel logs.  By default,
Citadel logs to the console, and that needs to be redirected somewhere
else in order to get any work done.  There are a variety of different
ways to do this, but since Linux provides a configurable syslog
d&aelig;mon,
it seems logical to edit the /etc/syslog.conf file (on Debian) and
point the local4 facility to a log file or somewhere else out of the way.
</p><p>
The first person to log in to the new Citadel Web interface becomes
the administrator-level user.  To create the administrator account,
point your Web browser to the host and port where you told WebCit to
listen during the installation, enter a user name and password, and
press the New User button (Figure 1).  You'll know you've become
the administrator if you see the Administration button on the bottom
left of the menu when you're logged in (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f1.large.jpg"><img src="9357f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f2.large.jpg"><img src="9357f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Lobby, When Logged In as Administrator
</p></div></div><p>
To enter the site-wide configuration, click the Administration
button, and you'll be brought into a well-organized and complete settings
menu.  Main categories are along the top of the page, and clicking each one
brings up the settings for that particular area.  As mentioned, Citadel
is also a text-mode BBS underneath the WebCit interface, and some of the
configuration options make that quite obvious.
</p><p>
Although a good study of all of the configuration items is outside the scope
of this article, the most important settings are under the Network and
Directory (if you're using LDAP).  Under the Network tab, you can enable
and disable services and modify the ports on which they run.  Under the Directory
tab, you can specify your LDAP settings.  If you're not using LDAP,
you probably can leave both of these screens alone, because the Network
defaults either are quite reasonable or will reflect your installation
choices (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f3.large.jpg"><img src="9357f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Network Services Settings
</p></div></div><p>
You may want to take a quick trip to the Access tab and make sure it
reflects how you would like new users to sign up.  Likely, for a corporate
server, administrators will create all of the accounts and user-driven
account creation can be shut off.
</p><p>
Sometime before letting users at the WebCit interface, you'll likely want
to customize the site a bit.  As you navigate through the default WebCit
installation, you may notice default text banners on the site that contain
the path to their locations.  A good example of this is the &ldquo;Welcome to
My System&rdquo; banner on the main WebCit log in page (Figure 1).  A variety
of text files exist in /usr/local/citadel/messages that can be tailored
to your needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e88f0"></a>
Setting Up E-Mail</h2></div></div><p>
First things first, and before you point your mail records to your new
Citadel server, you have to tell it what domains to accept e-mail
for.  I much prefer Citadel's way of handling this as opposed to mucking
about in configuration files.  To specify the domains for which you're interested
in handling e-mail, click on the Advanced menu option, and then the
Domain names and Internet e-mail configuration link.
</p><p>
In the resulting page, enter the first domain for which you want to accept mail
in the Local host aliases field.  Click the Add button, and continue
entering more domains as your situation requires (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f4.large.jpg"><img src="9357f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Internet Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
The Local host aliases field is the only setting that absolutely has to be
filled out, but you may want to integrate some more-advanced functionality
within this screen as well.  You can specify the domains to map to the
Global Address List (GAL), indicate smart host addresses if your server
isn't sending mail directly or point to a SpamAssassin or real-time
blackhole list (RBL) host to scrub incoming mail before it's delivered.
</p><p>
That's it.  You now can send and receive e-mail out of your
Citadel installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e8cb8"></a>
Setting Up Clients</h2></div></div><p>
There's no technical reason why a local client has to be set up at
all.  WebCit exposes all of the most-used groupware functionality via a Web
interface, and users can begin using that immediately to organize their
lives.  However, local clients do bring some power to the table, and many
users won't be satisfied with a Web interface.  Therefore, onward we go.
</p><p>
Depending on the needs of your users, a variety of Linux clients
can replace Microsoft Outlook.  After many setups, we've found that
KDE's Kontact is the easiest personal information manager to back onto a Citadel server, so that's
what we use here.
</p><p>
Kontact is the KDE Project's all-in-one personal information manager.  In
a sense, Kontact simply provides a unified interface to access KMail,
KOrganizer, KAddressbook and some notes and news components.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23df700"></a>
KMail</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up KMail is a rather intuitive process.  If you've ever set
up a mail client before, you'll be able to set up KMail without
issue.  As long as you've set up at least one of your Citadel server's
IMAP or POP servers, you can set up KMail to use either.  Simply
plunk in the URL or IP of your Citadel server, your account credentials
and be done with it (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f5.large.jpg"><img src="9357f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Set Up KMail for Citadel
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23df9c0"></a>
KOrganizer</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up the calendaring functionality of Kontact is a little more
indepth.  We've found that the GroupDAV protocol is the easiest and most
powerful to set up, so that's what we do here.
</p><p>
One of the few things you need to know is how to construct
your GroupDAV URL.  Quite simply, your GroupDAV URL is the URL to your
Citadel server (including the nonstandard HTTP port if you've told Citadel
to listen on a port other than 80) with /groupdav appended to it.  In my
case, my GroupDAV URL is http://192.168.38.128/groupdav.
</p><p>
To enable KCalendar's groupware functionality, click on the Calendar
icon in the left-side pane.  At the bottom of the middle pane is a section
labeled Calendar.  Right-click anywhere in that pane, and select Add.  In
the resulting window, select the GroupDAV Server option.  If
you don't see the GroupDAV Server option, it's likely you don't have
the kdepim-kresources package installed.  Install it, restart Kontact,
and you should be good to go.
</p><p>
The Resource Configuration window opens.  Enter a name that means
something to you in the Name field and your special GroupDAV URL into
the URL field.  Your user and password credentials are the same ones that
you set up when you logged in to Citadel the first time.  Click the
Update Folder List button, and the bottom Folder Selection pane should
populate with Calendar and Tasks radio buttons (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9357f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Set up KOrganizer (Kontact) calendar for Citadel.
</p></div></div><p>
It seems that clicking the check boxes beside the Calendar
and Tasks items would enable those items, but the system is a little
buggy.  In many cases, two instances of Calendar and Tasks show
up, as shown in Figure 6.  Further, to enable a Calendar or Tasks item,
the only way that seems to work is to right-click each item and select
Enable from the context menu.
</p><p>
Once you've enabled the Calendar, you can enter items either within
Kontact or within WebCit, and the items synchronize as mail is
checked or other server contact occurs (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f7.large.jpg"><img src="9357f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23dfff0"></a>Contacts</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up Kontact's Contacts (say that five times fast) is much the
same as setting up KCalendar.  Click the Contacts icon in the left-side
pane.  At the bottom of the middle column is a pane labeled Address
Books.  The right-click trick doesn't work here, so click the Add button
instead.  Select the same GroupDAV Server option, and fill in all the
same data that you filled in for the KCalendar setup.  Click the Refresh
Folder List button, use the right-click-to-enable trick, and
you're off to the races (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9357f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. GroupDAV Settings in Kontact
</p></div></div><p>
As with KCalendar, once you've set up your GroupDAV connector, you can
now manage your contact data from either KDE or WebCit (Figure 9).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9357f9.large.jpg"><img src="9357f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Citadel and Kontact Accessing the Same Data
</p></div></div><p>
Tasks and the Journal are just plain-old work once KCalendar is set up.  They
don't require any of their own setup.
</p><p>
A lot of other clients support the GroupDAV protocol to
varying degrees.  Any of these can be used in place of Kontact, albeit
likely with less functionality.  For a complete list of clients and the
status of their GroupDAV support, go to the GroupDAV site (<a href="http://www.groupdav.org/implementations.html" target="_self">www.groupdav.org/implementations.html</a>).
</p><p>
GroupDAV isn't the only technology that can be used with Citadel.  WebDAV
and Webcal can be used with clients, such as Mozilla Sunbird and
Evolution,
to share calendars and schedule events.  There is also a Microsoft Outlook
connector in the works, but at the moment, Outlook can be used to
access only POP/IMAP e-mail and IMAP folders.  As time marches on, more and
more clients that support GroupDAV and WebDAV come onto the scene.  The
Citadel FAQ contains a maintained list of clients and how to configure
them.
</p><p>
Although a few groupware projects are underway that can give Microsoft
Exchange a run for its money, we've found that Citadel is quite simply
the easiest to install and maintain.  The hardest part of a Citadel
install is waiting for all the components to download.  Citadel is under
active development, and by the time this article prints,
a new version may be out.  The lead developer, Art Cancro, can be found in the
Citadel support on the UNCENSORED! BBS forums
(<a href="http://uncensored.citadel.org" target="_self">uncensored.citadel.org</a>), along with other Citadel
developers and experienced users.
