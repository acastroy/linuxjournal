Invest some time into SELinux and worry less about zero-day attacks.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1133580.0x122b3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
SELinux, the NSA's powerful implementation of mandatory access controls
for Linux, can seem like a daunting technology.  It's got a lot of moving
parts that are labeled (pun intended) with arcane, acronym-intensive
terminology, adding some very dense layers of abstraction over Linux's
already-abstract architecture.  To compound the problem, much of SELinux's
documentation seems to have been written by security geeks for security
geeks.
</p><p>
Well, people say all that and worse about LDAP too, but as with LDAP
(which we covered in this column in the July, August and September 2003
issues of <i  >LJ</i>), you can make
SELinux do what you need it to do if you learn some basic concepts,
become familiar with a modestly sized list of terms and study some
representative policy files.
</p><p>
In this month's column, we discuss SELinux basics.  We
begin with SELinux's general design goal; introduce the concepts of
SELinux subjects, permissions and objects, and how they fit into
security contexts; and tie those ideas together in a discussion of
Type Enforcement.
</p><p>
Believe me, that's plenty to start off with! We'll save actual SELinux
configuration for subsequent columns.  But, if you have an urgent need to
get something working on an SELinux-enabled system, see the on-line Resources
for this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1133580.0x122b660"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
So, precisely what problem are we trying to solve with SELinux? Nothing
less than the entire security-patch rat race!
</p><p>
As I've said previously in this space, Linux security often seems to boil
down to a cycle of researchers and attackers discovering new security
vulnerabilities in Linux applications and kernels; vendors and developers
scrambling to release patches, with attackers wreaking havoc against
unpatched systems in the meantime; and hapless system administrators
finally applying that week's or month's patches, only to repeat the entire
trail of tears soon afterward.  This is the security-patch rat race,
and it's unwinnable.  There will always be zero-day (as-yet-unpatched)
vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
That's why I've spent so much ink over the years extolling techniques
such as virtualizing servers, creating chroot jails, running processes
as unprivileged users and using mandatory access controls, all of which
limit the effects of zero-day vulnerabilities.  SELinux, like Novell
AppArmor, is a mandatory access control implementation that doesn't
prevent zero-day attacks, but it's specifically designed to contain
their effects.
</p><p>
Why is the patch rat race unwinnable? Because in Linux's default
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model, each process runs with the
privileges of whichever user starts (or, sometimes, owns) it&mdash;that is,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of that user's privileges.
If an attacker compromises any
process running as root, or escalates a compromised process to root
privileges, the attacker can do anything root can do, even when that
action has nothing whatsoever to do with the process' intended
function.
</p><p>
For example, suppose I have a d&aelig;mon called blinkend that is running as
the user someguy, and this d&aelig;mon is hijacked by an attacker.  blinkend's
sole function is to make a keyboard LED blink out jokes in Morse code,
so you might think, well, the worst the attacker can do is blink some
sort of insult, right? Wrong.  The attacker can do anything the someguy
account can do, which might include everything from executing the Bash
shell to mounting CD-ROMs.
</p><p>
Under SELinux, however, the blinkend process would run in a
narrowly defined domain of activity that would allow it to do its job
(blinking the LED, possibly reading jokes from a particular text file,
and so forth).
In other words, blinkend's privileges would not be determined based on
its user/owner; rather, they would be determined by much more narrow
criteria.  Provided blinkend's domain was sufficiently strictly defined,
even a successful attack against the blinkend process would, at worst,
result in naughty Morse-code blinking.
</p><p>
That, in a nutshell, is the problem SELinux was designed to solve.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1133580.0x122b9d0"></a>
What SELinux Does</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to assume you understand how Discretionary Access Controls,
aka plain-old filesystem permissions, work in Linux.  If you don't, I
covered this topic in the October and November 2004 issues of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, in the two-part
series &ldquo;Linux Filesystem Basics&rdquo; (see Resources).
</p><p>
Suffice it to say that even under SELinux, the Linux DACs still apply.  If
the ordinary Linux permissions on a given file block a particular action
(for example, user A attempting to write file B), that action still
will be blocked, and SELinux won't bother evaluating that action.  But, if the
ordinary Linux permissions allow the action, SELinux will evaluate the
action against its own security policies before allowing it to occur.
</p><p>
So, how does SELinux do this? The starting point for SELinux seems
similar to the DAC paradigm: it evaluates actions attempted by subjects
against objects.
</p><p>
In SELinux, subjects are always processes.  This may seem
counterintuitive.  Aren't subjects sometimes end users? Not
exactly&mdash;users
execute commands (processes).  SELinux naturally pays close attention to
who or what executes a given process, but the process itself, not the
human being who executed it, is considered to be the subject.
</p><p>
In SELinux, we call actions permissions, just like we do in the Linux
DAC.  The objects that get acted on, however, are different.  Whereas in
the Linux DAC model, objects always are files or directories, in SELinux,
objects include not only files and directories but also other processes
and various system resources in both kernel space and user land.
</p><p>
SELinux differentiates between a wide variety of object classes
(categories)&mdash;dozens, in fact.  You can read the complete list on the
Web site &ldquo;An Overview of Object Classes and Permissions&rdquo;
(see Resources).  Not surprisingly, file is the most commonly
used object class.  Other important object classes include the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
dir
</p></li><li><p>
socket
</p></li><li><p>
tcp_socket
</p></li><li><p>
unix_stream_socket
</p></li><li><p>
filesystem
</p></li><li><p>
node
</p></li><li><p>
xserver
</p></li><li><p>
cursor
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each object class has a particular set of possible permissions
(actions).  This makes sense.  There are things you can do to directories,
for example, that simply don't apply to, say, X servers.  Each object
class may have both inherited permissions that are common to other
classes (for example, read), plus unique permissions that apply only
to it.  Just a few of the unique permissions associated with the dir
class are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
search
</p></li><li><p>
rmdir
</p></li><li><p>
getattr
</p></li><li><p>
remove_name
</p></li><li><p>
reparent
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Don't be frustrated by my not explaining these class names or
actions; at this point you don't need to understand them for their
own sake.  I'm simply illustrating that SELinux goes much, much further
than Linux DAC's simple model of users, groups, files, directories
and read/write/execute permissions.
</p><p>
As you might guess, SELinux would be impossible to use if you had to
create an individual rule for every possible action by every possible
subject against every possible object.  SELinux gets around this in two
ways: 1) by taking the stance &ldquo;that which is not expressly permitted, is
denied&rdquo; and 2) by grouping subjects, permissions and objects in various
ways.  Both of these points have positive and negative ramifications.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;default deny&rdquo; stance allows you to have to create rules/policies
that describe only the behaviors you expect and want, instead of all possible
behaviors.  It's also, by far, the most secure design principle any
access control technology can have.  However, it also requires you to
anticipate all possible allowable behavior by (and interaction between)
every d&aelig;mon and command on your system.
</p><p>
This is why the &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; SELinux policy in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4 and Fedora Core 3 actually implements what amounts to a &ldquo;restrict only
these particular services&rdquo; policy, giving free rein to all processes not
explictly covered in the policy.  No, this is not the most secure way
to use SELinux, and it's not even the way SELinux was originally designed to be
used.  But as we'll see, it's a justifiable compromise on general-purpose
systems.
</p><p>
The upside of SELinux's various groupings (roles, types/domains, contexts
and so on) is, obviously, improved efficiency over always having to specify
individual subjects, permissions and objects.  The downside is still more
terminology and layers of abstraction.  Alas, with power comes complexity.
</p><p>
So, how does SELinux group subjects, permissions and objects?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1133580.0x122cb00"></a>
Security Contexts: Users, Roles and Domains</h2></div></div><p>
Every individual subject and object controlled by SELinux is governed
by a security context, each consisting of a user, a role and a
domain (also called a type).
</p><p>
A user is what you'd expect: an individual user, whether human or
d&aelig;mon.  However, SELinux maintains its own list of users separate from
the Linux DAC system.  In security contexts for subjects, the user label
indicates which SELinux user account's privileges the subject (which,
again, must be a process) is running.  In security contexts for objects,
the user label indicates which SELinux user account owns the object.
</p><p>
A role is sort of like a group in the Linux DAC system, in that a role
may be assumed by any of a number of pre-authorized users, each of whom
may be authorized to assume different roles at different times.  The
difference is that in SELinux, a user may assume only one role at a
time, and may switch roles only if and when authorized to do so.  The
role specified in a security context indicates which role the specified
user is operating within for that particular context.
</p><p>
Finally, a domain is sort of like a sandbox: a combination of subjects
and objects that may interact with each other.  Domains are also called
types, and although domains and types are two different things in the
Flask security model (on which the NSA based SELinux), in SELinux domain
and type are synonymous.
</p><p>
This model, in which each process (subject) is assigned to a domain,
wherein only certain operations are permitted, is called Type Enforcement
(TE), and it's the heart of SELinux.  Type Enforcement also constitutes the
bulk of the SELinux implementation in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
</p><p>
There's a bit more to it than that, but before I go any further,
I want to use an example scenario to illustrate security contexts.
</p><p>
Suppose we're securing my LED-blinking d&aelig;mon, blinkend, with SELinux.  As
you'll recall, it's run with the privileges of the account someguy,
and it reads the messages it blinks from a text file, which we'll call
/home/someguy/messages.txt.
</p><p>
Under SELinux, we'll need an SELinux user called someguy (remember,
this is in addition to the underlying Linux DAC's someguy account&mdash;that is, the one in /etc/passwd).  We'll also need a role for someguy
to assume in this context; we could call it blink_r (by convention,
SELinux role names end with _r).
</p><p>
The heart of blinkend's security context will be its domain, which we'll
call blinkend_t (by convention, SELinux domain names end with _t&mdash;t
is short for type).  blinkend_t will specify rules that allow the
blinkend process to read the file /home/someguy/messages.txt and then
write data to, say, /dev/numlockled.
</p><p>
The file /home/someguy/messages.txt and the special file /dev/numlockled
will need security contexts of their own.  Both of these contexts can
probably use the blinkend_t domain, but because they describe objects,
not subjects, they'll specify the catch-all role object_r.  Objects,
which by definition are passive in nature (stuff gets done to them, not the
other way around), generally don't assume meaningful roles, but every
security context must include a role.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1133580.0x1625170"></a>
Decision Making in SELinux</h2></div></div><p>
There are two types of decisions SELinux must make concerning subjects,
domains and objects: access decisions and transition decisions.  Access
decisions involve subjects doing things to objects that already exist
or creating new things that remain in the expected domain.  Access
decisions are easy to understand.  In our example, &ldquo;can blinkend read
/home/someguy/messages.txt?&rdquo; is just such a decision.
</p><p>
Transition decisions, however, are a bit more subtle.  They involve the
invocation of processes in different domains than the one in which the
subject process is running or the creation of objects in different
types than their parent directories.  (Note: even though domain and
type are synonymous in SELinux, by convention we usually use domain
when talking about processes and type when discussing files.)
</p><p>
That is to say, normally, if one process executes another, the second
process will, by default, run within the same SELinux domain.  If, for
example, blinkend spawns a child process, the child process will run in
the blinkend_t domain, the same as its parent.  If, however, blinkend
tries to spawn a process into some other domain, SELinux will need to
make a domain transition decision to determine whether to allow this.  Like
everything else, transitions must be authorized explicitly in the SELinux
policy.  This is an important check against privilege-escalation attacks.
</p><p>
File transitions work in a similar way.  If a subject creates a file in
some directory (and if this file creation is allowed in the subject's
domain), the new file normally will inherit the security context (user,
role and domain) of the parent directory.  For example, if blinkend's
security context allows it to write a new file in /home/someguy/, say,
/home/someguy/error.log, then error.log will inherit the security context
(user, role and type) of /home/someguy/.  If, for some reason, blinkend
tries to label error.log with a different security context, SELinux will
need to make a type transition decision.
</p><p>
Get the picture? Transition decisions are necessary because the same
file or resource may be used in multiple domains/types; process and file
transitions are a normal part of system operation.  But, if domains can
be changed arbitrarily, attackers will have a much easier time doing
mischief.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Besides Type Enforcement, SELinux includes a second model, called Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).  Although I'm out of space for now, RBAC builds
on the concepts we've already discussed, providing controls especially
useful when real human users, as opposed to d&aelig;mons and other automated
processes, are concerned.
</p><p>
Next time, I'll describe RBAC at length and begin going into greater
depth on how actually to use SELinux, beginning with Fedora and Red Hat's
&ldquo;targeted&rdquo; policy.  Until then, be safe!
