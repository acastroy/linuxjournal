Kudos for the Bold Call to Boycott Novell</h4><p>
I wanted to write since it seems you're getting some flak in response
to your well articulated blog.
You probably already know this well enough, but it is something that
Vaughan-Nichols has been publishing, and I have been trying to convey
in similar published articles.
Only those who've observed MS business strategy over the years seem to
appreciate the key elements of your statement.
</p><p>
So, to help counteract some of that flak, I wanted to say THANK YOU for
holding a position, standing on substance, and being candid.

Marcel Gagn&eacute;s Column</h4><p>
In the November 2006 Letters section, Marcel Gagn&eacute;writes, &ldquo;With a very few exceptions
(such as Mr DeSouza), I get nothing but praise for my articles.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Let me cause another exception for Mr Gagn&eacute;and add my voice to those
who think the style of Mr Gagn&eacute;s articles are extremely annoying.
Usually I just scan the article looking for the actual content, as the
fluff is too cheesy and bothersome to wade through.  Asking around my
department (there are many avid readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i> here), no one
else even bothers to read the article because of the style.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Chris Russell  <br><br>
</p><p>
With apologies to Marcel for inadequately borrowing his style, Francois
serves a sweet white wine to some and a rich full-bodied red to others.
Most of our readers love Marcel's column. Your exception is respected
and noted.

Letters to the Editor</h4><p>
Every time I was starting a new project, <i  >Linux Journal</i> beat me to it
with an introduction article.  When I wanted to go PPC, my new issue just
arrived.  When I was reading about Qtopia, my new issue arrived.  When they
introduced the Nokia 770, my issue arrived to tell me all about its UI.
</p><p>
I don't expect every article to be meaningful for me, but I do expect
something from every issue.  Telling us about x264 was great (the part
about QuickTime users in specific), but the rest of the issue needs to
be refocused.
</p><p>
What I would like to see? How about a technical discussion of how the
Zaurus &ldquo;Sharp ROM&rdquo; is put together? How about a discussion on how to get
the 770's window system working for a workstation? How about an article
about the Qtopia phone? Does Trolltech offer a GPL phone edition for
use with the new Wi-Fi IP SIP phones (for example, WIP300)? I could go on and on
about the growing trends in these directions.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
J.   <br><br>

P2P over NAT</h4><p>
I enjoyed Girish Venkatachalam's article in the August 2006 issue of
<i  >LJ</i> about developing
P2P protocols across NAT.  I was particularly interested in some assertions
made and was wondering if Girish can provide some references to those.
</p><p>
In particular, &ldquo;At least 50% of the most commonly used networking
applications use peer-to-peer technology.&rdquo;  This doesn't seem right.
</p><p>
I always thought that, being connection-based, TCP was a lot easier to
NAT than UDP, although some TCP applications make it harder by including
IP addresses in the application layer part of the datagrams (such
as FTP in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mode), requiring the NAT router to have to inspect
and modify every FTP datagram.

SSH and DenyHosts</h4><p>
Regarding the yellow warning about SSH dictionary attacks
[<i  >LJ</i>, December 2006,
&ldquo;A Server (Almost) of Your Own&rdquo; by George Belotsky], try the wonderful
DenyHosts (<a href="http://www.denyhosts.net" target="_self">www.denyhosts.net</a>).
</p><p>
DenyHosts monitors the incoming connections into your server (mainly
SSH, but it can be FTP, POP or anything else with a login/password and
log file) and blocks source IP addresses by automatically adding entries
to /etc/hosts.deny.
</p><p>
I put it to run on a brand new Web server a month ago, and it has already
more than 7,000 forbidden addresses!
</p><p>
Besides, you also can share your blacklist with DenyHosts' Web site,
feeding a mega-blacklist of the really bad guys.

Java Java Java</h4><p>
I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for Java articles.  How about
Java applets (Ajax before Ajax), Java servlets, Swing (and real cross-platform stuff).  I look forward to hearing and reading about it.

PlayStation Games on Linux</h4><p>
In the May 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>, there was an article by Dee-Ann LeBlanc on the
above subject.  Unfortunately, the emulator that Dee-Ann recommended
is still available but unsupported for Linux; their Linux guy left
the project.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>But</em></span>, all is not lost; Linux will not be
beaten.  There is
a new Linux emulator starting called PCSX2, and it can be found at
<a href="http://pcsxii4unix.sourceforge.net" target="_self">pcsxii4unix.sourceforge.net</a>.  The new version is not completed
yet; they need help.
</p><p>
Thanks <i  >LJ</i> for the best Linux mag on the continent.
Always remember:
there are Linux users, and then there is the rest of society.

One Linux, Many Faces</h4><p>
In his letter [December 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>], Jon Alexander described how he surprised his friend by
logging in with different desktops.  If he really wanted to impress his
friend, he could have logged in with multiple desktops and then switched
between them.  He even could have included a couple of remote desktops
for good measure.  Also, don't forget about the virtual desktops that
Linux supports.

Thieving Teachers</h4><p>
It was interesting to read Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall's experience in his article
titled &ldquo;Soweto: Power from the People&rdquo; [see the UpFront
section of the December 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>] and compare it with an experience
our computer club had a few years ago.
</p><p>
The club committee decided that if the club members would donate their
redundant computer equipment to the club, the club would donate this
equipment to a Soweto school and help them set it up as a local network
and subsequently connect to the Internet.
</p><p>
The installation went fine, and the local network also worked; however,
when the installation team arrived to connect the school to the Internet,
what did they find? Every single piece of equipment had either
been stolen or broken.  It was subsequently discovered that some of the
teachers were responsible for some of the theft.

Optimal awking</h4><p>
I admit that I did not read the original article &ldquo;Analyzing Log
Files&rdquo; [October 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>]
by Dave Taylor.  I did see the &ldquo;Optimal awking&rdquo; letter
however
[Letters, December 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>].  Being an old
&ldquo;bit twiddler&rdquo;, I was interested in the enhanced run-time mentioned by
reordering the original:</p><pre     class="programlisting">awk '{ print }' access_log | sort | uniq -c | \
   sort -rn | grep "\.html" | head</pre><p>
to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">awk '{ print }' access_log | grep '\.html' | sort \
 | uniq -c | sort -rn | head</pre><p>
Now, I'm not really an awk person, but I was curious as to what
the awk program did.  Apparently, it is just an expensive version of
cat&mdash;that is, it copies its input to stdout, unchanged.  In that case,
why even have it? Also, why use grep? Instead, use fgrep, which,
in this case, produces the same result with somewhat less overhead:</p><pre     class="programlisting">fgrep '.html' access_log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head</pre><p>
[This] should produce the same output and totally eliminate the awk.  In
this case, no big deal.  Unfortunately, many neophytes will pick up a
script from a magazine and use it without really understanding it.  So, I am
a bit picky about examples.  For a one-shot, this is no big deal.  But I am
a bug for efficiency&mdash;comes from programming back on 1MHz 8080s, I guess.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I don't have a Web access_log to do any testing to see
if this really makes much of a difference.

A Touch of Elegance</h4><p>
I hesitate to take issue with an authority like Dave Taylor, but [his
script] uses repeated (and in many cases redundant) system calls and
divisions to achieve what simple multiplications can do [see Dave's
December 2006 column].  It also converts
the results to the wrong units.  (See <tt  >man units</tt> for a discussion.)
</p><p>
A simple algorithm to achieve the same effect is embedded in a test
harness as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh
# Script for numeric scaling - $1 = number, $2 = iterations

for (( i = 1; i &lt;= $2; i++ ))
do
    ki=1024
    mi=$(($ki*$ki))     # 1048576    without typo risks
    gi=$(($ki*$mi))     # 1073741824 without typos

    value=$1
    if    [ $value -lt $ki ] ; then
        units="bytes"
    elif  [ $value -lt $mi ] ; then
        units="KiB"
        div=$ki         # &lt; 1 Mi, so calculate Kibytes
    elif  [ $value -lt $gi ] ; then
        units="MiB"
        div=$mi         # &lt; 1 gi, so calculate Megs
    else
        units="GiB"
        div=$gi         # &gt;=1 gi, so calculate Gigs
    fi

    if    [ $units != "bytes" ] ; then  # scale value appropriately
        value=$(echo "scale = 2; $value / $div" | bc )
    fi

    echo "$value $units"

done

#       End tcon2</pre><p>
Running 1,000 iterations of each on an HP laptop with an AMD 2500 chip
showed the revised version to take approximately one-quarter of the time
(real, user, and system) of the original.

awk Is Not So Awkward</h4><p>
I don't think Dave Taylor gives awk enough credit [see Dave's November
2006 column].  I do not have access to
the same Web files, logs or version of Linux.  However, I do know that
his solution can be written entirely with awk.  Using AIX and HP-UX,
I did dummy up a mail log file, cheated on the date command and tested
my awk solution.
</p><p>
Below is awk code that I think would duplicate Dave's example:

<pre     class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

LOGFILE="/home/limbol/logs/intuitive/access_log"

awk '
       ( index($0, YESTERDAY) ) {
                        hits++;
                        bytes+=$10
                        next}
END {
      printf("Calculating transfer data for %s\n", YESTERDAY)
      printf("Sent %d bytes of data across %d hits \n", bytes, hits)
      printf("For an average of %d bytes/hit\n", (bytes / hits) )
      printf("Estimated monthly transfer rate: %d \n", (bytes * 30) )
     }
' YESTERDAY="$(date -v-1d +%d/%b/%Y)" ${LOGFILE}</pre>

Why Ubuntu and Then KDE?</h4><p>
I found it a little bit ironic that you chose Ubuntu as the 2006 Editors'
Choice Linux distribution, but that you chose KDE as your Editors' Choice
desktop environment.  It seems to me that if you were going to pick Ubuntu,
you'd choose GNOME, and if you were going to choose KDE, you would choose
Kubuntu.  Are there reasons you picked Ubuntu over Kubuntu, or did you
simply mean (K)ubuntu in general for your Editors' Choice distribution?
</p><p>
PS. Long live KDE!


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Geoff   <br><br>
</p><p>
As we said in our write-up, we also find it a puzzler as to why Ubuntu
seems to be a favorite, yet research data shows people prefer KDE over
GNOME by a significant margin.  Perhaps people refer to all variants
of Ubuntu as Ubuntu, even if what they're really using is Kubuntu.
Or, maybe others do like some of us at <i  >Linux Journal</i> do.  Some of us
at <i  >Linux Journal</i> install Ubuntu and then install and use KDE (thus
essentially converting it to Kubuntu).
