OSCAR Working Group's Open Source Cluster Application Resources
Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
Cluster gurus rejoice! The OSCAR working group recently released version
5.0 of its Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) toolkit.
OSCAR is a software package that &ldquo;supports the use of high-performance
computing by reducing the work of cluster configuration, installation,
operation and management.&rdquo;  OSCAR's developers have revamped the
application's infrastructure and included many new features, such as smart
package managers, yum-based package installs and image building, easier
client updating via a new repository approach and optimized startups
to reduce build times.  A new utility called netbootmgr has been added,
which &ldquo;greatly reduces the amount of time spent mucking about in the BIOS
by centrally managing a nodes behavior when a network boot is
detected&rdquo;.
In preparation for future releases, a new package and database structure
has been designed in anticipation of Debian support.  OSCAR 5.0 also
has been fully tested for use with both IA32 processors and x86_64 processors
under several major Linux distros.  OSCAR is available for download from
the group's Web site.

Message Partners' MPP</h2></div></div><p>
Got Postfix? Then Message Partners wants you to use its MPPv3,
the company's integrated pre- and post-queue spam filter for Postfix.
Message Partners claims that MPP &ldquo;solves all of the problems that complex
e-mail environments run into in a single high-performance
application&rdquo;,
including solutions for virus and spam filtering, content filtering,
access-controls, end-user quarantine and white/black list management,
archiving and other features.  A key new feature is the Postfix Policy
Server, which adds the &ldquo;capability to make pre-queue admission decisions
for every type of e-mail (including multirecipient and
multidomain).&rdquo;
Message Partners also touts its innovative sharing of a common database
and configuration by the pre-queue and post-queue filters, which improves
management of per-domain SMTP restrictions in large environments.  A free
trial is available at the company's Web site.

Scalix</h2></div></div><p>
Our contacts at Scalix Corporation informed us about Scalix 11,
the company's Linux-based, open-source supported messaging, e-mail
and calendaring platform.  Some of Scalix's main features include
easy administration, &ldquo;deep integration with legacy
environments&rdquo; and
Outlook-level functionality without the costs and license lock-in of
MS Exchange.  Scalix's target customers are those requiring the &ldquo;product
integrity of an enterprise platform with the community support of an
open-source project&rdquo;.  New features include two new Web services, a lightweight
mobile client, enhanced management capabilities, and improved Web client

Scalix claims advantages, such as &ldquo;vendor choice, better administration
and broader client selection while maintaining the best Outlook support
in the market&rdquo;.  A trial of the commercial edition and a free community
edition are available for download from Scalix's Web site.

VMLogix's LabManager</h2></div></div><p>
Virtualization is dynamic these days, and VMLogix adds to the fabulous
ferment with LabManager, the company's virtualization solution centered
on the software development life cycle.  LabManager, says VMLogix, offers
&ldquo;rapid, highly repeatable, resource-optimized deployments of complex,
multimachine software test environments&rdquo; that allow developers to reduce
cycle times and infrastructure costs, share resources seamlessly and
improve the quality of the final product.  LabManager's approach enables
users to exchange development environments with each other regardless
of time, location or project status.  Other product advantages include
platform agnosticism, physical- and virtual-machine capabilities and
compatibility with most testing and development tools.  Free evaluation
licenses and downloads of LabManager are available at VMLogix's Web site.

Terra Soft's Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3</h2></div></div><p>
Linux people simply rock, don't they? A case in point is Terra Soft,
which has ported its Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) v5.0 to the PlayStation 3
(PS3) from Sony.  Hopefully by the time you read this, you can finally
get your hands on a PS3, because we can't! With Sony's blessing and
support from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, YDL is a full Linux
OS for PS3, which is based on Fedora Core 5 and comes complete with
more than 1,500 packages.  In this project, Terra Soft also collaborated with
Carsten Haitzler and the Enlightenment development team to integrate the
E17 desktop, which the firm says will provide &ldquo;an unprecedented level of
function and interface aesthetic&rdquo;.  Install and source ISOs for YDL are
available for download; DVDs are available for purchase from the Terra
Soft's on-line store.
