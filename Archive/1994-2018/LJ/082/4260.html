<i  >Linux Journal</i> to be all about Linux is like
expecting a thick magazine called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Martha Stewart
Living</em></span> to be all about Martha Stewart. No, wait, bad
example. But you get the idea. Linux, which is a kernel written to
comply with the POSIX standard, is a commodity piece of software.
(By the way, <i  >LJ</i> is two-thirds the size of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Martha Stewart Living</em></span> with one-tenth the
staff. We don't have to cook a bunch of new recipes, but on the
other hand, Martha doesn't have to lay out %{$_} Perl code.)
</p><p>So, since Linux itself just sits there and works&mdash;how
boring&mdash;we generally fill out the magazine with articles on web
servers, development tools and other fun stuff that runs on top of
Linux&mdash;and, not surprisingly, on other commodity POSIX-compliant
kernels too. We could cut out &ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo; and a few other
things here and there, and sell the same content as &ldquo;POSIX
Journal&rdquo;.</p><p>But just because something is a commodity doesn't mean that
it's not newsworthy. After all, pork bellies are a commodity, and
they make the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Farm Report</em></span> every day. So it's
Special Kernel Issue time.</p><p>Clay Claiborne, a Linux consultant in Los Angeles, had some
Digital UNIX (or whatever they're calling it these days) drives
that a client wanted Linux to read. It wasn't as simple as just
compiling in support for UFS, but thanks to freely available code
and documentation, and the developers who know how to apply it, it
wasn't impossible either. His step-by-step journey into the process
of adding support for a new/old file system is on page 94. Even if
you just use ext2fs, it's a great read to help you understand the
free software troubleshooting process.</p><p>You might have heard that the SuSE distribution now includes
Linux with ReiserFS support. We like ReiserFS so far because its
journaling feature means that you can just turn your Linux box off
and reboot without a time-consuming fsck. But what really makes
ReiserFS different from old-school UNIX file systems and from
Linux's standard ext2fs? Chris Mason explains b-trees and just what
happens when ReiserFS saves your data from an untimely crash, on
page 118.</p><p>Where the Internet is concerned, things used to be pretty
clear&mdash;routers just do routing, and hosts just originate and accept
connections. But with the rise of load balancers, firewalls
(whatever those are; firewall-mongers use the word to mean whatever
they're selling) and network address translation, the world of
machines through which Internet traffic passes is becoming a
strange bestiary indeed.</p><p>Nenad Corbic and David Mandelstam write about WANPIPE, the
Linux driver software for sangoma PCI WAN adapters with which you
can create your own strange beast of an Internet appliance&mdash;a
frame-relay box for the remote office, a box that connects straight
to the T1 line without a CSU/DSU, whatever you need. There are a
lot of security, performance, and other problems to be solved on
the Internet and WANPIPE (page 100) is part of your toolkit for
attacking them.</p><p>What's the first kernel to offer a standard API for voice
over IP? Linux, of course. Greg Herlein explains what's behind
/dev/phoneN and how software like ohphone can use it to make phone
calls anywhere at no charge&mdash;except of course your local Internet
connection&mdash;on page 108. And yes, you can plug a real phone into
it.</p><p>Finally, what do all these kernel projects have in common?
Freedom, of course. Centrally planned proprietary software, our
society's biggest example of Stalinism in action, is being replaced
with a free-market system. This is good.</p><p>Every so often, though, people try to sell proprietary
components for a working free system, claiming some performance
advantage. But this impolite and destructive practice is worse than
just not being &ldquo;down with the revolution&rdquo;. If we replace
bureaucratic Big Software with a feudal system in which local
software warlords each try to gain some advantage over the others,
we'll find it difficult or impossible to do the kinds of projects
covered in this issue.</p><p>I'm not talking philosophy or hypothetical here&mdash;do a web
search for the name of any non-GPL Linux kernel module and get a
bushel of archived list messages asking for help when the
proprietary module throws some other module's glasses on the
ground, stomps on them, then tells it to get out of town and sets
the kernel on fire.</p><p>We're in the early stages of replacing top-down Stalinist
software with a functioning free society, and thanks to politeness
and common sense we're doing a pretty good job of avoiding the
detour through feudalism. In the long run, freedom works both
morally and economically. This issue's kernel development success
stories show just how useful a commodity our favorite kernel can
be.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti, Technical Editor</p></div></div>
