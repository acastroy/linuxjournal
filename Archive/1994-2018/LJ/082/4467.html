    &ldquo;The only game that's interesting to Tim is to come up with
    a vision, or a series of visions, and watch them unfold&mdash;and see
    exactly how he can realize each by hacking the system.&rdquo; --Eric S. Raymond
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaef580.0xbe7558"></a></h2></div></div><p> At the first Linux World Expo after the
turn of the millennium (January 31-February 3, 2000), I had a brief
talk with Tim O'Reilly that I recorded and then lost. Recently,
when that tape reappeared, I gave it a listen and found that it was
as relevant as ever&mdash;perhaps even more so&mdash;because Tim is one of
those rare businesspeople who not only takes the longest and
broadest possible view but acts constantly on Yogi Berra's most
impossible advice: &ldquo;When you see a fork in the road, take it.&rdquo;
Looking back, Tim seems to have taken every fork along the way and
sometimes several at once. Yet, there also seems to be something
consistently broad and encompassing about every one of those
decisions.
</p><p>In retrospect, the vision Tim shared in that talk seems
exceptionally knowing and prescient, especially since I was mostly
interested in just one question: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Why didn't he sell
out</em></span>? Even though publishing companies are not held in
especially high regard by venture capitalists (who tend to value
businesses with potential valuations in the billions over ones with
actual revenues in the mere millions), O'Reilly has a long track
record of growth and success. More significantly, it is one of the
most influential companies in the software world.</p><p>Yet O'Reilly expressed almost no corporate vanity&mdash;at least
not compared to other companies in its communities that were either
already public or headed that way. Relatively speaking, O'Reilly
&amp; Associates never seems to care about selling itself, beyond
whatever it takes to publicize its various products and services.
It has always been, in the oddly discreet vernacular of finance,
private. And Tim has told me more than once that he intended to
keep it that way.</p><p>I wondered why. For freshly public Linux companies, Y2K was a
heady time, as all of them were still surfing a tsunami of fashion
investing. Red Hat, Cobalt Networks, Andover and VA Linux Systems
had all gone public in late 1999 to enormous run-ups in valuation.
At the time I spoke to Tim, VA Linux had just bought Andover.net
(now the OSDN division of VA Linux) for more than $1 billion in
stock. Less than two months earlier, VA went public to the largest
first-day run-up in history, closing at $239 after trading as high
as $320. Red Hat had gone public only four months earlier and
peaked at close to $270 around the time of VA's debut. When I spoke
to Tim, VA was trading in the $120s and Red Hat at around $100.
Even though those numbers were way off their early peaks, both
companies were very, very hot, and Linux along with them.</p><p>Today the Linux investment tsunami is flat as a pond. VA
Linux shares now (on November 20, 2000) sell for around $13 and Red
Hat's for around $10. Meanwhile O'Reilly &amp; Associates continues
to truck along in its merry, myriad ways, looking far the wiser for
not selling at any price.</p><p>Here's the conversation with Tim. The date was February 1,
2000.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: One of my pals here
just suggested that more money was spent on booths at this show
than all the Linux companies in the world combined made in revenues
last year. That make sense to you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: [Laughing] No, but they
have a job to do and a lot of money to spend.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Linux is hot right now.
You're a major player in the category. It seems to me that you
could easily sell out if you wanted to. Yet you haven't.
Why?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: This is really the
second big explosion that we've been an interesting part of. The
first was the Web. The second was Linux and open source. There were
others before the Web, actually. And there will be others after
Linux. We've been around long enough to know that every trend is
more like a wave than a line that goes up toward the sky. One wave
builds on another. When you identify with any one of them, you get
a short term advantage out of it, but then you get locked into that
stage in history. We could have been a UNIX company, or a PC
company, or a groupware company, or an on-line company, or an
Internet company, or a web company or, now, a Linux company. Trust
me: another wave is going to come after this one. Linux will still
be here, but it won't be the hot thing it is right now. Nor should
it be.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You just don't want to
get locked in, then.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Right. It's just never
interested me very much. We've just been around too long. We're
good at what we do, and we have a role to play; we'll just keep on
playing it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I used to have a
partner who said, &ldquo;Don't say no, say how much.&rdquo; That's another
way of saying everything has a price. If that's so, and you're
still saying no&mdash;and companies like Andover, which had a small
fraction of O'Reilly's revenues last year, are selling for upward
of a billion dollars&mdash;then you're telling me that you value
O'Reilly &amp; Associates somewhere in the billions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: [Laughing] I suppose
so.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Okay, so you like to
take the long view. Give me some background on that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Like a lot of people, I
got started doing programming. And, like a lot of people who do
programming, I saw a need for manuals. So, the company got started
in 1978 as a technical writing consultancy specializing in manuals.
In the early eighties, open systems were getting hot, and we
started licensing our manuals to various UNIX vendors. Gradually
our consulting business gave way to a publishing business.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But you've been more
than a publishing business. You've been highly involved with,
rather than just selling to, a market or a category.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: We do like being part
of the industry and what makes the industry change over time. I
think we probably have a better sense of where things are going and
the pulse of technology, than most companies do, mostly because
we've been around a long time, and we cover a lot of topics.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You're not tied down to
any one category, or title or whatever.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: No, we're not. Whatever
programmers and other technologists need, we're there publishing a
book about it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Or running a
conference.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Or starting something
like GNN, which we sold to AOL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I had forgotten about
that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: There are a few things
I'd like to forget.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I'd like to talk a bit
about the issue of intellectual property, which I know you care
pretty deeply about. Jeff Bezos did us the favor of putting the
issue of software patents on the front burner when he obtained the
patent for one-click shopping and promptly sued Barnes &amp; Noble
for infringing on it. You've been very vocal about the whole
matter. I'd like to hear what IP (intellectual property) means to
you.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I think of intellectual
property as topsoil. Hard to make, easy to waste. It's a rich
substrate of ideas, techniques and opportunities that anyone can
use. That's a rich soil on which you can build business
opportunity. We should all be mindful of that and contribute to it.
But there are some business models, particularly business models
that create hype and fund themselves out of the stock market rather
than providing real value to customers, that don't contribute.
These models leech nutrients out of the system. If you can convince
customers that they should not have to pay for high-quality
technical information, for example, nobody will produce it. What
some of these companies have done is exploit some short-term
conditions that allow them to take a whole bunch of money out of
the pockets of potential shareholders while, at the same time,
destroying the conditions that made their success possible. So,
it's like hey, there's all this stuff that we could get for next to
nothing. We'll pretend that we have a viable business model by
selling it cheaper than the cost of production. This is just like
what happens with resource exploitation in the physical world. Hey,
air and water are free! Somebody once asked Ted Turner what he
would build a business on if he were a young man, and he said
&ldquo;Water.&rdquo; And he's buying up watersheds all over the place. He
knows there is stuff that has real value that's undervalued at the
current time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And you think this is
the case with software IP?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I just see a lot of
danger in business models that are predicated on some resource that
was not created or enriched by the people who exploit it. Again,
this is one of the imperatives of the Linux community. So far it's
doing better than the Internet community did. I joined the Internet
Society Board back in '95 because I saw this happening with the
Internet. I had hoped they could model themselves on the Sierra
Club. I thought the environmental movement was a great model of
people saying, &ldquo;I have some kind of right in this common good. I
can speak for it even if I don't own it.&rdquo; There is this common
heritage represented by the Internet culture, by Internet software,
by open-source software, that is being exploited in the same way
that natural resources have been exploited. Users need to have some
voice that says &ldquo;don't do that to us.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So we'd say to Amazon,
&ldquo;Don't sue Barnes &amp; Noble over your patent on a natural
resource. Beat them some other way.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Exactly. You can
compete but don't compete in a way that's destructive to the
substrate that you're building on. Again, I think that the Linux
and Open Source communities have done a much better job than the
Internet community did five years ago. Linus and various Linux
companies have done a better job of giving back to the community
that depends on the environment the community is creating. They are
much more conscious of what we hold in common. But I don't think
it's as far-reaching yet as it needs to be. We need people thinking
about this over a very long period of time. I don't know if you've
seen the book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Clock of the Long Now</em></span>, by
Stewart Brand. I was at a lecture he gave with Brian Eno in which
Eno talked about speaking to this woman who lived in a wonderful
house in a lousy urban setting. When he asked her how she liked
living here, she said it was terrific. But he realized she was
talking about &ldquo;the small here&rdquo;, not &ldquo;the large here&rdquo;. He said
he realized that a lot of our problems in society come from our
definition of what we're going to care about, how local it is, and
we often miss the larger picture. Or worse, we obscure it by
painting a small one on top of it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You see this as
relevant to our current infatuation with the stock market rather
than the larger market that surrounds it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Yes. We have a lot of
businesses optimized for the short term and for a narrow set of
interests. They don't spend a lot of time asking, &ldquo;What will the
big benefits be for the culture as a whole?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How far back does
open-source consciousness go?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: We've talked a lot
about open-source software, but the IBM PC was just as big a
revolution in its time&mdash;and still is. It was open-source hardware.
That's what made it cloneable. Its openness freed up a tremendous
wave of innovation. But what happened on top of that was the
building of a new proprietary empire that was even more oppressive
than IBM was in the hardware days. I fear that we're actually going
to get there again in spite of Linux. I've been saying for years
that just because one layer of software is free doesn't mean that
the next layer will be free. We can expect to see closed software
being built on free and open-source software, where the new
applications will be fundamentally closed. You can look at Amazon
as an application. Or Mapquest. Or E-Trade. These guys are not
touched by open-source licenses. The GPL does not matter if you
don't distribute software. E-Toys won't give away their e-commerce
software because they don't have to&mdash;which may be fine. I have no
problem with that. But I do note that these developments are not
part of the ecosystem. They don't give back to the common soil that
we all grow from.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you prefer the GPL
to other licenses?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: The one thing I don't
like is the compulsive aspect of it. I mean, people can choose not
to use it, but it also keeps some people from using it. But my
point is that it's most critical to establish the culture in which
the companies that build on the open platform realize it's in their
interest to keep it going. Microsoft has more to gain from feeding
the Open Source community than by competing with it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I think it's inevitable
that Microsoft will support open source in a variety of ways over
time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Possibly. But there
really are a lot of choke points here. To me, the fundamental
insight that Microsoft had in the software world was that there are
choke points, and if you can hold those passes, you can control the
markets that depend on them. And believe me, many people in the
e-commerce and the Web world are thinking the same way. And some of
them are getting a pretty good stranglehold on some of those choke
points, and they will inevitably have others dancing to their tune.
I am very concerned that we are going to see in this new layer a
number of players who try to dominate by controlling choke points.
They may not be as dominant as Microsoft overall, but they will be
just as dominant in their own categories.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What about the big
media players&mdash;such as AOL/Time Warner?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I'm not too concerned
about the big media conglomerates. Well, we do need to be concerned
about the ways we get broadband. The sources matter, in terms of
how fast broadband is deployed, what kind of access they provide,
and who controls it. But the fact is, the active producer/passive
consumer model doesn't work very well anymore. We're all too
connected. Those of us on the leading edge really do think of
markets as conversations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: We see supply and
demand as symmetrical.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Right. And we like
technology that works the same way. It should be of interest to
readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i> that when we did our
web site, we deployed the first NT-based web server. Why did we, a
UNIX company, do that? Well, we saw at the time that the Web was
breaking down the fundamental model. The vast majority of people
using browsers were using them on Windows, and there were no
Windows servers. So I used to joke that the Web was becoming the
world's largest read-only groupware system. That was in fact the
model. What we tried to do was keep alive the vision of the Web as
a peer-to-peer medium. In fact, we did.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How did it work
out?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Not very well as a
business, but it did get Microsoft into the web server market. For
all the bad stuff one can say about it, the people using that
platform can publish to the Web. Prior to that, we were hearing all
this stuff about push technology from people who were trying to
make the Web look like television instead of an interactive
model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: They were trying to
weld the Web to the rusty back end of television's history.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: That's right. And this
choice of ours to deploy NT as a web server was an example of
trying to think in a bigger way. If we said, &ldquo;Our primary
allegiance is to Linux, or UNIX, and we wouldn't be caught dead
using NT,&rdquo; we wouldn't have done anybody any favors. We said,
&ldquo;Hey, the users are using Windows, and they're getting a bum deal
here.&rdquo; We need to give them the same tools as the culture that we
want to build. And that's a key concept here. Why did we publish
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Windows 98 in a Nutshell</em></span>? Because we want to
teach people using that platform how to think in the way that the
people who are over on UNIX think. I want them to be empowered and
show them that they're the bosses. If you look at that book, you'll
see it teaches, as much as it can, the UNIX mindset, on this
crippled platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you bring a similar
message to the Linux world from what lies outside?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: A lot of what I try to
get across to the Linux community is the importance of the Web.
Take &ldquo;the network is the computer&rdquo; as the mantra. You've got to
be a player there. What I worry about is that so much of the focus
is on the last war, which was over operating systems. I kind of
feel like the real question is how are we going to play in the
world being built on top of those operating systems, regardless of
what they are. I look at the web-based open-source projects as what
we need to think about more, get involved in more. Apache.
SendMail. QMail. Even something like MySQL. Anything web-related is
really important. The big question should be, what does the
computer of the future look like? I think it all looks like one big
computer. So, how are we building the tools to participate in that?
For example, what we're doing with Collab.net is figuring out and
training people how to work in a collaborative way. So much of the
Linux conversation has been about how the roots of the movement
have been in the GNU project and free software. I'd like to talk to
people about its roots in Usenet. Its roots in the way people
shared information. If we think the conversation is about a
particular style of software licensing, and that Microsoft ought to
put out its software under open-source licenses, and that &ldquo;we&rdquo;
somehow win if &ldquo;you&rdquo; ignorant mortals follow what the priesthood
hands down without question, we've all lost. At the end of the day,
it's about a culture of communication and innovation that comes
from many points and not down from on high. In some sense, we have
a chance to build a new world. I see too many people jumping ship
from this new world to go back and work in the old one&mdash;or in the
part of the old one that's building closed stuff on the open new
world we're all building together. So, it kind of goes back to the
beginning of this conversation when we were talking about the
money. If you don't think long term, you play into the hands of the
old order.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But there is a lot of
financial incentive to think and behave short term.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: That's right. And those
of us who take advantage of those opportunities need to keep the
long term in mind, to keep the common interests in mind. This is a
world we're building together here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And there's still money
to be made there, too.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Exactly.</p><p>After I turned the tape recorder off, I suggested to Tim that
he take a look at Jabber, the new open-source instant messaging
system. By August, Tim was talking up Jabber at his Open Source
conference; and not long after that he joined the Jabber.com board
of directors. (I was, and still am, on the advisory board.)
Meanwhile Tim's patent reform conversation with Jeff Bezos has
morphed into Bounty Quest, a site that involves several communities
in the same patent reform effort.</p><p>The man just keeps taking those forks.</p></div></div>
