    Reuven shares more tips on the usefulness and limitations of
    three-tiered architecture&mdash;and just what is it?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we began our investigation of
three-tiered design for our web applications. By separating the
database server from the web application itself by means of a
&ldquo;middleware&rdquo; object layer, we simplify the logic in our web
applications. Furthermore, by adding an abstraction layer between
our web application layer and our database layer, we gain the
ability to use the same middleware in non-web applications, as well
as the possibility of changing the back end without telling the web
application.
</p><p>By the end of last month's column, we had implemented a
simple middleware layer that could communicate with the People and
Appointments tables we created in a PostgreSQL database. This
month, we will briefly look at some web applications we can develop
using these objects. You will see that at no time does our web
layer directly access the relational database; the SQL is all
contained within the objects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118d768"></a>The Web Application Layer</h2></div></div><p>In an ideal universe, we could create the web application
layer using any language or technology we might want, communicating
with the middleware layer using a universally agreed-to protocol.
However, the world is not quite as advanced as we might like, and
our choice of an object layer forces our hand when choosing a web
application environment.</p><p>We created our objects in Perl, so we will need to use Perl
to implement our web application. To avoid the overhead associated
with CGI programs, and because we can get a great deal more power
by tapping into the mod_perl module for Apache, we will use Mason,
the Perl-based template and development application environment
that we looked into last year. Each Mason component is compiled as
necessary into a Perl subroutine, which is then compiled into Perl
opcodes. These opcodes are then cached in the mod_perl module
inside of Apache, where they can be executed at a much faster rate
than would be possible using CGI.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118d8c8"></a>Adding a Person</h2></div></div><p>Our first web application example will allow us to add a new
person to our database. This will require two Mason components: an
HTML form (which could equally well be a static form) and one which
attempts to add a new person to the database. In order to
accomplish this, we will use the middleware People object, which
connects to the database for us and attempts to store a new row in
the database. Simple versions of these two components are shown in
Listings 1 and 2. These listings are too long to print here; they
are available at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>.
The HTML form (add-person-form.html) submits its name-value pairs
to add-person.html. The latter creates an instance, People, then
invokes the new_person method to create a new person:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $success = $people-&gt;new_person
                         (first_name =&gt; $first_name,
                         last_name =&gt; $last_name,
                         country =&gt; $country,
                         email =&gt; $email);
</pre><p>If $success is true, we know that a new person was added to
the database with the arguments that we passed to
$people-&gt;new_person. Otherwise, we know that the invocation has
failed.
</p><p>However, this is a very crude way of determining whether
things have succeeded or failed; rather than present users with an
all-or-nothing proposition, it would be nice to tell them what they
did wrong so that they can fix the problem. If a hung database
process produces the same error message as does an attempt to add a
second person with the same e-mail address, it will be hard for
anyone to solve the problem.</p><p>Thus, the solution is for our web application to check its
inputs before passing them to the middleware layer. The more such
checks we can insert into our code, and the more application-level
error messages we can display, the better.</p><p>Our add-person.html component performs two basic checks that
demonstrate this: It uses Mason's &lt;%args&gt; section to require
that each of the potential arguments has been passed. An HTML form
that tries to submit its values to add-person.html must provide
each of the listed form elements, or Mason will refuse to honor the
request and print a stack trace describing what went wrong. End
users won't see this error if they make a mistake filling out the
form, but you'll see it if you leave required &lt;input&gt; tags
out.</p><p>Once our Mason component executes, we can thus be sure that
we have at least received the appropriate name-value pairs. But do
they contain legal values? In an &ldquo;unless&rdquo; statement at the top of
add-person.html, we check that we received non-empty values for the
four parameters that we will use in our invocation of
$people-&gt;new_person. If any of them are missing, a message is
displayed telling the user what is expected.</p><p>To be even safer, we also check that the e-mail address looks
relatively valid. The regular expression in Listing 2 will not
match all e-mail addresses, but it is good enough for the purposes
of this simple example. Users who try to pass an invalid e-mail
address are shown an error message that tells them what to
change.</p><p>Once we can be sure that the values are relatively sane, we
can then invoke $people-&gt;new_person. Notice how add-person.html
manages to do all of this without ever talking directly to the
database. DBI is obviously taking an active role in each invocation
of $people-&gt;new_person, but that happens behind the scenes, and
our Mason components don't need to concern themselves with it. This
means that if the People object has been thoroughly debugged, there
should not be any chance of encountering SQL errors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118dce8"></a>Editing a Person</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how to add a new person to the database
using our People object, let's try a slightly more difficult task:
changing a person's first name, using the update_first_name method.
(See Listing 3 and Listing 4 at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82/</a>
for examples.) We can only invoke this method once we have already
selected an individual, which means that our editing form will have
to let us do so.</p><p>While it might be tempting to let users select an entry by
typing a name or e-mail address into a text field, this is prone to
too many errors to be effective. Instead, we will allow users to
choose from a &lt;select&gt; list. This removes the possibility
that a user will enter an e-mail address (or another defining
characteristic) for a person who might not be in our
database.</p><p>We want to use a unique key to choose the person whose first
name will be modified&mdash;but at the same time, it seems a bit
impersonal to present a list of e-mail addresses. My solution was
to go back to the People object (People.pm) and define a new
method, get_names_and_addresses (see Listing 5 at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82/</a>).
This returns a list of array references, where each array reference
contains a name and an e-mail address. The former can be used as a
unique key (and as the &ldquo;value&rdquo; within an &lt;option&gt; tag),
while the latter can be used for display purposes. We can thus
iterate over the e-mail addresses and produce a &lt;select&gt; list
as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="email"&gt;
% # Iterate through the names and addresses,
  # printing them out
% foreach my $info (@names_and_addresses) {
  &lt;option value ="&lt;% $info-&gt;[1] %&gt;"&gt;&lt;% $info-&gt;[0] %&gt;
% }
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre><p>Allowing users to edit other user attributes would proceed in
a similar way. Indeed, so long as you ensure that the user chooses
a key that uniquely identifies the user, you can change any and all
of its attributes using a similar type of form.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118e000"></a>Adding an Appointment</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how we can use the People object to
indirectly manipulate our People table in the database, we will
start to look into our appointment book, handled by the
Appointments object. This object allows us to add an appointment
with a particular person on a particular day and time.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we will (once again) need two
components. The first component (add-appointment-form.html, in
Listing 6 at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>)
produces an HTML form that allows users to enter a new appointment
into the system, choosing a person from a predefined &lt;select&gt;
list. (If this were an actual project, I would put the
&lt;select&gt; list in a separate component, allowing other
components to produce a menu of entries in the address book.) In
addition, we have to know when the appointment starts, as well as
when it ends. Once again, I prefer to have people select a date and
time from &lt;select&gt; lists, since it removes the problems
associated with time and date formats.</p><p>The following Mason code produces the three &lt;select&gt;
lists that we need in order to have the user choose a month, day
and year. By defining the @months and @years arrays in advance, we
can make the code more readable, as well as update the system for
future years quickly and easily:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="begin_month"&gt;
% foreach my $month (@months) {
    &lt;option value="&lt;% $month %&gt;"&gt;&lt;% $month %&gt;
% }
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;select name="begin_day"&gt;
% foreach my $day (1 .. 31) {
    &lt;option value="&lt;% $day %&gt;"&gt;&lt;% $day %&gt;
% }
&lt;/select&gt;
,
&lt;select name="begin_year"&gt;
% foreach my $year (@years) {
    &lt;option value="&lt;% $year %&gt;"&gt;&lt;% $year %&gt;
% }
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre><p>The second component, add-appointment.html (see Listing 7 at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>),
allows us to add a new entry into the appointment calendar. It
checks (using an &lt;%args&gt; section) that we have submitted all
of the required name-value fields from add-appointment-form.html.
We then issue the same kinds of basic checks that our other
components have done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118e318"></a>Are These Three Tiers?</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have demonstrated how easy it is to create a
three-tier web application, it's time to consider how many tiers
we're really using. Does the term &ldquo;three-tier&rdquo; really apply
here?</p><p>The term &ldquo;three-tiered architecture&rdquo; grew out of a
dissatisfaction with another popular architecture known as
&ldquo;client/server&rdquo;. For example, databases and web servers are both
examples of modern client/server systems. Just as a client/server
system typically refers to two physical computers, a three-tiered
system refers to three physical computers, with each tier residing
on a separate machine.</p><p>By contrast, the simple three-tiered application we have
examined certainly had three layers in that there were distinct
software systems that had clear goals and APIs and made it possible
for the application and database layers to speak through a common
middleware layer. At the same time, at least two of these layers
(the web application and the middleware objects) were on the same
computer without any real possibility for separation. If the web
application were to become swamped with traffic, we could certainly
add one or more identical Apache servers&mdash;but there is no way to
put the application layer on one computer and the middleware
objects on another.</p><p>So while I believe that we have now demonstrated some of the
advantages of three tiers from the perspective of an application
developer needing standard APIs, we have not seen a true
implementation of such a system. In order to do so, however, we
must have the ability to perform remote procedure calls (RPCs),
such that a web application on one computer can invoke a subroutine
or object method on another computer. This is possible and is
getting increasingly easy with the growth of SOAP (Simple Object
Access Protocol), but it brings with it a number of other problems
and caveats, including the need to learn yet another transmission
protocol.</p><p>While we're reconsidering how to define tiers&mdash;perhaps we
should consider that the application developed does have three
tiers, but that they are defined in a different way than we have
considered until now. Instead of counting the tiers as (a)
database, (b) middleware layer and (c) web server, perhaps we
should count them as (a) database, (b) web server and (c) web
browser? If we think in these terms, then we have indeed created a
three-tier architecture&mdash;but come to think of it, so has anyone who
has ever written a CGI program that talks to a database.</p><p>Moreover, we can introduce additional layers of abstraction
into the mix here, complicating things further. What about stored
procedures, triggers and views created on the relational database?
Although not a physical tier, it can certainly make life easier for
the person writing either an object layer or an application that
accesses the database. Indeed, stored procedures are often better
than an object middleware layer, because they execute on the
database and are precompiled, making them relatively speedy.</p><p>We can also execute code on the web client (i.e., inside of
the web browser) using JavaScript. While I generally encourage my
clients to avoid JavaScript as much as possible, this buggy,
insecure language riddled with cross-platform incompatibilities is
the only way to execute programs from within a web browser, rather
than on the server.</p><p>So, when we have a web application that uses a relational
database, stored procedures, an object middleware layer, a web
application layer and client-side JavaScript divided between three
computers, how many tiers do we have? It's probably still three,
but the fact is that it doesn't really matter what you call it. In
the end, a decent design that takes into account your project's
specifications, including the need for future growth, is the right
way to go&mdash;regardless of how it jibes with the latest buzzwords and
techniques.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118e688"></a>Problems with Three-Tier Design</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have looked at a very simple three-tier project,
it's time to look at some of the problems associated with such a
design. I am not saying that three-tier solutions are inherently
evil, but neither are they a panacea. Like most solutions, they are
appropriate under certain circumstances. In many cases, splitting
the design and implementation among several people can be easier
when you divide the work into different layers, as we saw with our
web-based appointment calendar. One person could write all of the
necessary code, but two people could probably do it more quickly
and easily, given a well-documented interface between them.</p><p>As with any engineering solution, there are always
trade-offs. With a three-tiered design, perhaps the most important
trade-off is time. Such an architecture takes longer to specify and
design, even if it will eventually be more robust, easier to write,
easier to test and easier to divide among a number of
programmers.</p><p>While dividing a project into many parts might make it easier
to specify and test each part, it makes integration testing all the
more important and difficult. If everyone sticks to the published
and agreed-to API, such testing does not have to be terribly
difficult. But there are always differences between the
specification and the implementation, and integration testing tends
to bring these out. The more tiers in a project, the more important
and difficult such testing can be.</p><p>Finally, it can be difficult and frustrating to create an
object middleware layer that provides an interface to the database.
SQL is not a perfect language, but it allows us to express a very
large number of queries with a very small number of
commands.</p><p>Removing SQL from the Mason components and forcing
programmers to work with an object API, means that the programmer
will be limited to a small subset of the database's power and
flexibility. Every time more functionality is needed, the
programmer will have to request it be added to the middleware's
API. Being able to specify any database query inside of an HTML
template (e.g., a Mason component) is a liberating experience for a
programmer, and taking that freedom away can be frustrating.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1095580.0x118e8f0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Programmers designing large or complex web applications are
finding it increasingly useful to adopt the three-tiered
architecture beginning to replace the simpler client/server model
that has been favored for the last decade. Indeed, creating
three-tiered applications can often make life easier. In the end,
however, you will have to decide whether this solution is
appropriate for your needs or if it's overkill given your time
frame and specifications.</p></div></div>
