    Open-source software development provides an inspirational model
    for books.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182d580.0x1925450"></a></h2></div></div><p>A little over a year ago I began writing
a book about developing KDE applications. The KDE project was
introducing many new APIs and subsystems into the development code
that would eventually become KDE 2.0, and developers would need
documentation to keep pace with all of this new technology. But how
could a book, which needs to be written, edited, reviewed and
printed (with some of these steps occuring several times), be made
available before the software about which it is written changes?
Half of the solution was to enlist as contributing authors several
talented developers who were designing and building the new
technologies and to keep us all working in parallel from the
then-current code base (the &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo; code). The other
half, use of the Open Publication License, has lead to the
development of Andamooka and the concept of open support.
</p><p>The goal of Andamooka (a web-based reader support system,
<a href="http:///www.andamooka.org" target="_self">http://www.andamooka.org/</a>)
is to keep a book current and correct through the use of
coarse-grained community annotation of the on-line text. Annotation
is public and is itself open content, and so can be redistributed
along with the original text in, ideally, more accurate and
up-to-date annotated versions of the text.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182d580.0x1925608"></a>Open Content</h2></div></div><p>Open-content, using the term generally, is any content
(typically textual, but not necessarily excluding sound, images and
other types of &ldquo;content&rdquo; you might wish to consider) that can be
freely modified and redistributed. If this reminds you of
open-source software, it is, because that was its
inspiration.</p><p>Reasons for attempting to apply the open-source software
development model to open content are described in &ldquo;Open Source
Content Development&rdquo; by David Wiley
(<a href="http://opencontent.org/bazaar.shtml" target="_self">opencontent.org/bazaar.shtml</a>),
&ldquo;Why You Should Use the GNU FDL&rdquo; by Eric Raymond
(<a href="http://www.onu.org/philosophy/why-gfdl.html" target="_self">www.onu.org/philosophy/why-gfdl.html</a>)
and &ldquo;Do Open-Source Books Work?&rdquo; by Benjamin Crowell
(<a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/article.html" target="_self">www.lightandmatter.com/article/article.html</a>),
but allow me to try to summarize. First of all, the open-source
software development model:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Puts software in the hands of, more or less,
whoever wants it because the software is free.</p></li><li><p>Creates more niche software because open-source
software may be freely modified.</p></li><li><p>Produces more robust software because the software
gets tested by many different users in many different
situations.</p></li><li><p>Produces software with features that are in demand
because lots of feedback is received from users and, often enough,
users contribute by doing some development.</p></li></ul></div><p>These four items can potentially translate well into
open-content development.
</p><p>Writers can reach more readers by giving their work
away&mdash;and, indeed, writers want to be read. In the special case
where the content is documentation for open-source software, it
becomes imperative that the software documentation allow itself to
be modified and redistributed so that new documentation can be
derived from old documentation when new software is derived from
old software.</p><p>We can consider content to be robust if it is accurate and
comprehensible. The levels of accuracy and comprehensibility of
content increase when reader feedback is incorporated into new
versions. In other words, an open-content development model
presents the image of many readers-as-editors, each focusing on the
aspects of the work that interests them.</p><p>Finally, if there are many readers of a work, there will be
lots of feedback that points out what is missing. This gives the
author (or authors) the information they need to plan new versions
of the work. If readers are welcome to participate in the
authoring, they might write and submit corrected or new portions of
the work, thus distributing the workload and potentially creating
something better than one person (or a small group of people) could
have.</p><p>Open content licenses include the Open Publication License
(<a href="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub" target="_self">www.opencontent.org/openpub</a>),
the GNU Free Documentation License
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl/html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl/html</a>)
and the Linux Documentation Project boilerplate
(<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html</a>).
Each of these allows the work to which it is applied to be modified
and redistributed. The first of these has provisions for placing
restrictions on the distribution of the work in printed format.
Such a restriction could help a publishing company recoup the cost
of creating the book (a process that involves many person-hours of
labor and, of course, a lot of paper). I personally recommend that
if companies choose to include this restriction when a book is
initially published that they later remove it, for example, after
development and other costs are recouped or after a predetermined
period of time has elapsed. Allowing the creation of paper versions
of a work (i.e., excluding the optional restriction) might help it
to reach people in markets where it would not normally be
distributed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182d580.0x1925e48"></a>Open Support</h2></div></div><p>It should be clear by now that open-content licensing has the
potential to produce high-quality content. Today there are already
many open-content books available on the Web, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Grokking the GIMP</em></span> by Carey Bunks;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GTK+/GNOME Application Development</em></span> by Havoc
Pennington; <span   class="emphasis"><em>DocBook: The Definitive Guide</em></span> by
Norman Walsh; and, Leonard Muellner and; of course, <span   class="emphasis"><em>KDE
2.0 Development</em></span> by David Sweet, et. al., but authors
could do much more than simply post the text of their books if only
the proper tools were available.</p><p>The Andamooka web site offers some of these tools, for free,
to authors. Authors can post their book for on-line reading and
annotating and for download in various formats. They can run
announcements, news, questions, etc., and offer other support
materials, such as source code or related documents to users. Using
these tools, an author can offer support to his/her readers by
interacting directly with them and by providing a forum in which
readers with a common interest&mdash;after all, they're all reading the
same book!&mdash;can interact. This situation differs from a
less-structured public forum (like a usenet newsgroup, for example)
in that the book can facilitate interaction by providing the
readers with a common language in which to discuss the subject as
well as a framework around which to organize their
discussion.</p><p>The heart of Andamooka is annotation. The full text of each
book is displayed with annotation at the end of each section. This
is how the structure just discussed is realized. Annotation may be
added and viewed by anyone visiting the site. The annotation is
submitted under the Open Publication License so that it may be
redistributed along with the book. Readers can read an annotated
version of the book on-line or download it to read on their
computer or to print out at home.</p><p>When collecting a large amount of information, as the
community annotation for a book might become, one has to consider
ways to maintain and encourage quality. Andamooka has an
experimental moderation and points (or Karma, &agrave; la Slashdot)
system based on the SlashCode system. A score is assigned to each
piece of annotation based on random, occasional polling of readers.
When polled, a reader can choose one of three ratings (let's call
the rating r): good (r=3), neutral (r=2) or bad (r=1). For the
purpose of ranking the annotations for viewing, attempting to put
the &ldquo;best&rdquo; at the top, a score (call it S) is assigned to each
article. If we call N the number of times an article has been
rated, then the score is: S=SQRT(N)*AVG(r)/STDDEV(r). In plain
English, this means that an annotation is rated higher if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>More people have rated (and, presumably, read) it
(SQRT(N))</p></li><li><p>People have, on average, given it a better rating
(AVG(r))</p></li><li><p>People are in greater agreement about the quality
of the annotation (1/STDDEV(r))</p></li></ul></div><p>To encourage quality submissions, users are given points&mdash;or
&ldquo;Karma&rdquo;--based on how the annotation they write is rated by the
community and, possibly, based on how much they contribute and how
recently they have contributed. These features have yet to be fully
implemented.
</p><p>The hope is that this system will serve as a community
editing, offering a way for readers to sort out the best
annotation. As Andamooka is in its infancy, I cannot say whether
this system is successful or not.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182d580.0x19264d0"></a>Open Development</h2></div></div><p>The next step is the creation of an open-development system.
The model, as it is discussed today, derives from open-source
software development (as mentioned above) but has some different
issues to contend with. Those interested in open development would
like to create a book, or other work, by having many contributors
plan, write, edit, format, etc., in hopes that the workload will be
distributed, the work will be of high quality and everyone will
enjoy what they are doing (since it is volunteer work). Similar
goals have been achieved in the open-source software world, so
what's different about open content?</p><p>Authors may not be as technically savvy as software
developers (note that by &ldquo;authors&rdquo; I don't necessarily mean
authors of technical books). So, unlike software developers, they
can't necessarily make use of software-project management tools
(for example, CVS) that are difficult to install, maintain, and/or
used to develop a book, however capable those tools might be. Thus,
there is a need for user-friendly project management and
collaboration tools. The TWiki web-based application
(<a href="http://twiki.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://twiki.sourceforge.net/</a>)
and its Wiki Wiki kin are good examples of these kinds of tools,
but they need to be expanded upon to be appropriate for
open-content development. The members (myself included) of the
FreeBooks Project
(<a href="http://freebooks.myip.org" target="_self">http://freebooks.myip.org/</a>),
founded by Benjamin Crowell, are exploring designs for the needed
tools and methods for managing this type of project (for example,
we are testing a method of incorporating DocBook document
collaboration into TWiki). In fact, this exploration process has
been organized around writing a free book about writing free books.
(You are encouraged to participate. Please visit the web site for
details.)</p><p>One also has to wonder whether an open, community-development
model for content will attract contributors the way similar
software projects do. So far, several people are contributing to
the FreeBooks Project, and translations of <span   class="emphasis"><em>KDE 2.0
Development</em></span> into five other languages are underway.
These numbers may not be as impressive as those used when
discussing open-source software, but these projects have only just
begun, and I consider the level of participation to be very
encouraging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182d580.0x1926790"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Andamooka is a first step toward full open-content
development. The books we see on the site now, and probably those
we'll see in the near future, were written in a closed manner but
are being made available under open licenses that allow
modification and redistribution. By making use of Andamooka,
authors can offer readers direct author support and the support of
rest of the readership. Together the authors and readers can create
a base of knowledge that can be culled and transformed&mdash;by any
community participants&mdash;into a better and better book.</p><p>I plan to continue work on <span   class="emphasis"><em>KDE 2.0
Development</em></span> using the Andamooka system. I will encourage
users to offer feedback and contribute to development by writing,
editing, translating, reporting errors and suggesting new topics.
This work will be released later in free, electronic editions of
the book. As such, <span   class="emphasis"><em>KDE 2.0 Development</em></span> serves
as a test case for open-content development.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>David Sweet</b></span>
