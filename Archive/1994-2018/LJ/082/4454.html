    Brief looks at the various embedded Linux projects and
    applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a68580.0x1b60500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Because Linux is openly and freely
available in source form, a great many variations and
configurations of Linux distributions have evolved in order to
match the needs of a broad range of markets and applications. There
are implementations ranging from handheld devices including PDAs
and cell phones, to Internet appliances, thin clients, firewalls,
telephony infrastructure equipment and even supercomputer clusters.
There are small-footprint versions and real-time enhanced versions.
And despite the origins of Linux as a PC operating system, there
are now ports to numerous non-X86 CPUs, with and without memory
management units, including PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, 68K and even
microcontrollers. And there's more coming, all the time!
</p><p>One of the most interesting characteristics about embedded
Linux, is the abundance of choice. Even for a given architecture,
such as PowerPC, there tends to be an abundance of available
alternatives. So, how do you decide which distribution to use? That
depends.</p><p>First, it's important to realize that all Linux distributions
are, more or less, variations on the same theme. That is, they tend
to be collections of the same basic components, including the Linux
kernel (of course), drivers, command shells (command processors),
GUI and windowing frameworks, utilities and libraries.</p><p>So, what makes them different? The distinctions between
distributions frequently center around which of the many hundreds
of Linux utilities are included, what modules or utilities (both
open-source and proprietary) are added, kernel patches and
modifications, and how the installation, configuration, maintenance
and upgrade process is managed. How easy is it, for example, to
build a small-footprint Linux system that closely matches your
application's unique requirements?</p><p>Then there's the question of proprietary open-source
software. This might be an important philosophical issue for you or
your company. You (or your company) may want to restrict your
Linux-related activities to using exclusively open-source software
so there are no licensing restrictions or royalty requirements, and
so that you can supply source code to your customers. Or, you might
prefer a more pragmatic approach, using (and sometimes licensing)
whatever software components best match your application's
needs&mdash;whether proprietary or open-source.</p><p>Either way, whether you decide to use pure open source, or to
mix open and proprietary software components, using Linux in
embedded applications is unlikely to be totally &ldquo;free&rdquo; of costs.
You'll either invest resources to create your own implementation,
money for tools and licensed components, or pay for outside
services and support.</p><p>That said, there are certainly a wide variety of excellent
open-source tools and utilities that you can download free of
charge; and, there are also excellent proprietary tools and
utilities that you would need to license or purchase. Then, too,
bear in mind that the companies that offer &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; embedded
Linux distributions generally possess a high level of expertise and
have well-trained staff ready and waiting to assist you in your
project. Paying money to one of the &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; embedded Linux
suppliers can have many advantages, including development tools,
useful utilities&mdash;and, of course, support. The proprietary embedded
Linux suppliers' companies are actively investing in developing
tools and services to differentiate their Linux offerings from the
pack, and (or) to advance their standing as a prospective partner
for companies building embedded applications that will have Linux
inside. In many cases, they are also contributing to the overall
pool of open-source software.</p><p>Taken as a whole, there are a great many options&mdash;both
open-source and proprietary&mdash;that fall into these general
areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Tools to automate and simplify the process of
generating a Linux configuration that is tuned to a specific
embedded system's requirements.</p></li><li><p>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), windowing
environments and browsers that vary in size, appearance, features
and capabilities.</p></li><li><p>Drivers and utilities that support the specific
needs of a diverse range of applications including telephony
equipment, multimedia devices, mobile computing, wireless
capabilities and more.</p></li><li><p>Linux kernel enhancements and add-ons that support
the &ldquo;hard&rdquo;, &ldquo;firm&rdquo;, or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; real-time performance
requirements of such applications as streaming media, IP telephony,
machine control, etc.</p></li></ul></div><p>What follows, are brief descriptions of many of the currently
available commercial and noncommercial sources for embedded Linux
solutions. Bear in mind that new projects and products come into
being on an almost daily basis. For this reason, LinuxDevices
maintains a set of continually updated on-line embedded Linux Quick
Reference Guides that are available for free public access.
