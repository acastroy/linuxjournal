    Herlein explains the integration of the telephony device driver
    into the Linux kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f283f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>A year ago, Internet Telephony was a
curiosity, and many people thought it would never work for real
phone calls. Now, with services like Net2Phone, Deltathree.com and
DialPad providing free or extremely low-priced phone calls
delivered via the Internet, Voice over IP (VoIP) has reached
near-mainstream status. While Linux clients for those services are
not yet available, Linux is not being left behind. With the 2.2.14
kernel, Linux has taken a bold lead in the area of computer
telephony integration: we have the first modern operating system
with a defined kernel-layer application programming interface (API)
for telephony support. To sweeten the pot, excellent quality
open-source telephony software is already using this API. You can
call around the world using Linux and the Internet&mdash;and the call is
free!
</p><p>This article will explain the basics of how the telephony
device drivers are integrated into the kernel in a way suitable for
creating a common API across vendors. Then we'll discuss the basic
ideas behind the design and function of the API, and how data and
event information are dealt with separately. Finally, we'll discuss
how telephony events (like ringing or picking up a handset) are
handled in a process called &ldquo;asynchronous event
notification&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f28558"></a>New Kernel Option: Telephony Support</h2></div></div><p>There are many people who've asked why we needed a new
telephony support API for the kernel. Even Alan Cox had to be
convinced! After all, most of the Internet Telephony software out
there can use a sound card, and if that card supports full-duplex
(simultaneous playing and recording) and the user has a decent
microphone-speaker headset, the quality of the call can be
adequate. Why add complexity and a new API?</p><p>The answer is quite simple: sound cards are not telephone
devices! Sound cards can't generate dial tone, rings, wink,
flash-hook or caller-ID&mdash;all of which are needed to operate a
normal phone device properly. Yes, sound cards are functional for
limited telephony use with a headset and microphone, but real
telephony cards let you plug that nice cordless phone in and be
free from the short cord to your computer...or plug into a
sophisticated business phone system. Sound cards also have no
chance of providing the ability to plug into the phone line
provided by your local telephone company, therefore, losing the
ability to do inbound and outbound call control, hop-on and hop-off
toll bypass applications or use any of the other new generation
telephony software applications being written today.</p><p>Also, for any real VoIP use over the Internet, it is
necessary to compress the audio data. To be compatible with other
VoIP applications and equipment you must support the commonly
accepted compression codecs like G.723.1 or G.729a. Unfortunately,
if you want to do this in software you have to license the codecs,
and this can cost in the six-figure range (easily!) these libraries
are most certainly <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> open source. Telephony
cards (like the Quicknet cards mentioned below) have pre-licensed
these codecs and provide them built into the hardware. This avoids
the mess of paying per-copy royalties for the codecs (it's part of
the hardware cost) and lets you develop code with your own choice
of license, not one imposed on you by the codec developer. In other
words, you can do open-source VoIP software and still use the
advanced codecs! These codecs are most definitely not something you
would find on a sound card.</p><p>Additionally, sound cards can't interface with phones or the
phone system, and they can't support hardware-based audio
compression codecs. Sound cards are simply different from phone
cards.</p><p>To be fair, telephony cards are not sound cards either. Sound
cards have audio capabilities that far exceed what telephones can
do. For example, sound cards are stereo; phones are mono. Sound
cards can sample and playback sounds at music frequencies
(20Hz-20kHz); phones are limited to voice frequencies (300Hz-4kHz
typically). Sound cards have advanced music capabilites and often
support MIDI and extensive sound effects. Phone cards cannot do any
of that. The hardware and functionality are very different. The
device drivers and the API need to be different, too.</p><p>But wait, you say, &ldquo;what about all the great software out
there that can work with sound cards, like voice recognition and
text-to-speech processing?&rdquo; Wouldn't it be nice to be able to use
that software on phone devices with a minimum of effort? You can.
The API for Linux telephony was designed to work in a way that does
not preclude the use of software originally intended for a sound
card with a telephony device. Yes, some minor code changes will be
needed, but it's not all that hard. I'll explain more about that
towards the end of the article.</p><p>The push for this new API was spearheaded by Quicknet
Technologies, Inc., which manufactures a line of phone cards. In
November of 1999, Ed Okerson of Quicknet and myself (I was an
employee of Quicknet at the time) proposed the precursor to today's
API to Alan Cox. After several weeks of intense e-mail and a pile
of code by Ed and Alan, the Linux telephony API was born.</p><p>So, how does it work? Let's get started.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f28920"></a>The Basics: Phone Devices</h2></div></div><p>At the operating system level, all devices are referred to by
numbers. We look in <b  >/dev</b> and see a collection of
file names, but down deep Linux looks at devices based on a major
and a minor number. Devices of a particular type all share a single
major number; individual devices of that type must each have their
own minor number. For example, if you do <b  >ls -al
/dev/ttyS0</b> you'll see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gherlein@tux:~/lj &gt; ls -al /dev/ttyS0
crwxrwxr-x   1 root     uucp       4,  64 Oct 27 06:23 /dev/ttyS0
</pre><p>Note that that the file permissions mask has the first
character as a &ldquo;c&rdquo;, indicating that it's a character device. It's
owned by root and is in the uucp group. The next two numbers are
not file sizes, like you'd see on a normal file; they are the major
and minor number. In this case ttyS0 has a major number of 4 and a
minor number of 64.
</p><p>The Linux Telephony API assigns the major device number of
100 to phone-type devices. Your distribution of Linux has probably
not created the devices for you, like it has for
<b  >/dev/ttyS*</b>, <b  >/dev/audio</b> and
other older, commonly accepted device mappings. If
<b  >/dev/phone*</b> devices are not present on your
system, you'll need to make them before using the Linux Telephony
API. You can fix this yourself quickly with the following command
(as root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /dev/phone0 c 100 0
</pre><p>This creates a new device file called
<b  >/dev/phone0</b>. It's a character device with a
major number of 100 and a minor number of 0. Refer to the
<span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> man page for more details on
this command. You only actually need enough device files for your
hardware, but most folks create devices 0 15 by default.
</p><p>Note that there is presently an error in the file
<b  >/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt</b>. This
file, which provides official assignments for all major numbers it
currently states that Linux telephony is to use major number 159
and that 100 is deprecated. This is an acknowledged error and will
be fixed in future documentation. The correct major number for
Linux telephony (and the number used in the kernel) is 100.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f28ef8"></a>The Phonedev Module&mdash;Device Brokering</h2></div></div><p>Alan Cox developed the phonedev module based on a similar
approach that he took for the Video4Linux Project. There will be
many vendors who create products capable of being a phone device.
Rather than having multiple telephony product vendors, each
requiring their own major number, they can all use major number 100
and the commonly defined <b  >/dev/phoneN</b> (where N is
the device number).</p><p>All of these must present a common basic interface to
user-space software, that is, they must all follow the same common
API.al, though they may provide extensions particular to their
product. Vendors will create their own device driver module that
will implement this common API as an external interface by dealing
with the inner details of their particular hardware.</p><p>The phonedev module solved the problem of mapping the minor
device number to a specific vendor-type module at runtime. The
source code is in the
<b  >files/usr/src/linux/drivers/telephony/phonedev.c</b>
and the header files, phonedev.h and telephony.h, are located in
<b  >/usr/include/linux</b>. Here's how it works.</p><p><a href="4468l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. phone_device
Structure</a></p><p>Every phone device must use a phone_device structure (see
Listing 1). Likewise, every phone device must call two functions to
interact with the phonedev module in order to register and
unregister itself. These are defined as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
extern int phone_register_device
    (struct phone_device *, int unit);
extern void phone_unregister_device
    (struct phone_device *);
</pre><p>At load time, the phonedev module sets itself up and waits to
service other telephony devices. When a telephony driver is loaded
(by <span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span>, as discussed later) it
calls the phone_register_device function. A simple explanation of
this function is that it keeps a pointer within the phonedev module
to the phone_device structure, searches for the first open minor
number and assigns that to the phone device, and then increments a
counter to track the fact that something is using the phonedev
module (to prevent it being unloaded while in use).
</p><p>The practical implications of this are simple: the first
telephony modules loaded will be assigned the first available
(lowest numbered) minor numbers. This is crucial to understand in
cases where modules from different vendors need to coexist on the
same system, and specific assignment of a particular card is
desired to match a particular minor number (a specific
<b  >/dev/phoneN</b> device). In other words, if you have
a device from XYZ company and a device from ABC company, and you
want ABC's card to be <b  >/dev/phone0</b>, you'll have
to make sure that the driver for ABC gets loaded first.</p><p>All devices must provide at least the basic functions to
interact with the device: open, read, write, close, etc. These are
all part of the &ldquo;file operations structure&rdquo; (see linux/fs.h for
details). Each device defines the functions appropriate for
itself.</p><p>Anytime a program opens a <b  >/dev/phoneN</b>
device, it's actually calling the
<span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span> function defined in the
phonedev module's file operations structure. This function performs
the following operations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It grabs the minor device number from
<b  >/dev/phoneN</b> inode.</p></li><li><p>It builds a string of the form
<b  >char-major-%d-%d</b> using the major and minor
numbers. In the case of minor number 0 (corresponding to
<b  >/dev/phone0</b>), this string would be
<b  >char-major-100-0</b>.</p></li><li><p>It uses this string in a call to
<b  >request_module</b> to ask that the module be loaded.
This has the same effect as if the program
<span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span> was called (in fact, it
actually starts a separate kernel thread and executes
<span   class="bold"><b>modprobe</b></span> in it). This ensures
that, if the device is a module instead of a part of the kernel,
<span   class="bold"><b>kmod</b></span> has a chance to load the
module before phonedev tries to use it.</p></li><li><p>It then calls the
<span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span> function in the phone device
module to perform the actual act of opening the individual
device.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, the phonedev module has two basic purposes:
to assign minor numbers to phone devices dynamically at load time
and provide a clean way to autoload needed phone device modules at
run time. It's clear, though, that a good understanding of modprobe
and module dependency is needed to fully understand the telephony
modules and their interactions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f205a0"></a>Modprobe and Phone Devices</h2></div></div><p>If you are using kmod to automatically load kernel modules as
you need them, then you will need to make sure that several aliases
are defined in the <b  >/etc/modules.conf</b>
file.</p><p>First of all, the system needs to know that char-major-100 is
the phonedev module. Add this line to define:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias char-major-100   phonedev
</pre><p>Now the system will need to know what actual phone device
modules to associate with specific minor numbers. As we learned
above, this may not guarantee that the phonedev module actually
assigned that minor number to the phone device at module load time,
but we'll cover that in more detail below. In the following
examples we'll use the telephony cards from Quicknet Technologies
Inc. (www.quicknet.net). These cards have Linux drivers in the
kernel and are relatively inexpensive compared to most telephony
cards. Quicknet's device driver is
<span   class="bold"><b>ixj.o</b></span> and the module name is
<span   class="bold"><b>ixj</b></span>. This driver is used for all
of their telephony card products (it's smart enough to handle the
ISA, PCI or PCMCIA flavors as well as knowing which cards have
which kinds of phone interface circuits). To define that Quicknet's
driver is associated with <b  >/dev/phone0</b>, add this
line to <b  >/etc/modules.conf</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias char-major-100-0  ixj
</pre>


As you'll recall from the discussion of phonedev's fopen function
above, phonedev will build a string of the form
<b  >char-major-%d-%d</b> and fill in the parameters with
100 (major number) and the requested minor number. In our example,
attempting to open <b  >/dev/phone0</b> would result in
phonedev attempting to load <b  >char-major-100-0.</b>
That device is unknown to the kernel module loader. The alias
command above <span   class="bold"><b>maps</b></span> that string to
the module name ixj. When we try to open
<b  >/dev/phone0</b> the phondev module will autoload the
ixj module for us, and then call the fopen function defined in the
ixj module to open the device (assuming your kernel was built to
support the kernel module loader with CONFIG_KMOD=y).

only thing read-from and written-to phone devices using
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> is actual audio data. This
is separate from&mdash;and handled quite differently from&mdash;event type
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f20d30"></a>Audio Data</h2></div></div><p>What, specifically, is audio data, and how is it different
from event data? Audio data is the result of the analog-to-digital
(A/D) conversion (and possibly data compression) on the audio
signal present at the microphone of the telephony device. The
<span   class="bold"><b>offhook</b></span> signal resulting from
picking up the phone handset is an
<span   class="bold"><b>event</b></span>. The tone that results from
the user pressing a digit on the phone handset is an event even
though that action may also generate audio. An incoming ringing
signal is called an event. In short, all non-microphone inputs are
events. All microphone input (and the corresponding speaker output)
is audio data. This audio data is read and written from the phone
device using the standard read and write system calls.</p><p>Most phone devices will provide audio data compression in the
device. In fact, for successful Internet telephony applications,
some form of audio data compression is required. These compression
techniques are called &ldquo;audio codecs&rdquo; (or codecs for short), and
there are a set of commonly implemented and interoperable codecs.
The Linux telephony API includes defined constants for most of
these common codecs; however, a particular phone device may or may
not support them all. Control of what codec is in use is handled by
an <span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> system call.</p><p>One large difference in how Linux telephony API differs from
what used to work with sound cards is that Linux telephony API is
&ldquo;frame-oriented&rdquo; while sound cards are &ldquo;byte oriented&rdquo;. A
device that is frame-oriented reads a discrete frame of data
corresponding to a unit of time. This is done because all audio
codecs operate on a period of audio data at a time (usually 10, 20
or 30 milliseconds' worth of data). Because use of a compressed
codec is the norm for network telephony applications, this is the
normal and expected mode of operation for phone devices. Sound
cards do not have this restriction and are free to read and write a
variable number of data bytes on any give call. The API defines
&ldquo;frame sizes&rdquo; for each codec, and raw uncompressed audio data
from the device is one of the codec choices. For example, the
LINEAR16 codec (uncompressed 16-bit sound samples) has a default
frame size of 240 bytes&mdash;corresponding to 30 milliseconds of data
at the default 8000Hz sample rate. Every read operation from the
device will result in 240 bytes of data or nothing. Of course, you
can change this behavior with ioctl calls to adjust the size of a
frame for uncompressed codecs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f20ff0"></a>Controlling Phone Devices&mdash;the ioctl System
Call</h2></div></div><p>Commands for the phone device to perform certain actions are
not written to the phone device using a write call&mdash;only audio data
is written to the device. To control the phone device, a set of
ioctl functions are defined to handle the basic phone activities.
This basic set of ioctl functions are defined in
<b  >/usr/include/linux/telephony.h</b>. Vendors who wish
to extend that basic set of capabilities may do so, but those
functions are limited to their own device driver and are outside
the scope of the common Linux telephony API.</p><p>An example will best illustrate this potential. Using the
telephony API with a Quicknet Internet PhoneJACK card and a phone
plugged into the card (called an FXS port or POTS port by telephony
folks), Listing 2 shows a brief program to ring the phone.</p><p><a href="4468l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Ringing the
Phone</a></p><p>You'll notice that the device is opened, defaulting to
/dev/phone0 if the user does not provide a specific device name on
the command line. The maximum number of rings is set with an ioctl
call using the PHONE_MAXRINGS constant. The phone is then
instructed to ring using the PHONE_RING ioctl. This example program
is a simplified version of the LGPL module
<span   class="bold"><b>ring.c</b></span> found in Quicknet's
Software Developer Kit (SDK). It's too simple to do anything more
than illustrate the technique and demonstrate the use of ioctls to
control a phone device, but real-world programs need not be much
more complicated, the API is fairly simple. All the Linux telephony
API ioctl constants are defined in the header file
<b  >/etc/include/linux/telephony.h</b>.</p><p>It's this basic fact that allows software written for sound
cards to be adapted easily for use with phone devices; like sound
cards, the only data written using the read and write system calls
is audio data. In addition, the low-level constants used in the
defined telephony ioctl calls were designed to avoid conflict with
existing sound card ioctls. Porting an application that expects a
sound card to use a phone card instead will primarily involve
handling the errors returned from the sound card ioctl calls your
code makes. It should be possible (though perhaps not easy) to
write a wrapper that opens the telephony device and spawns a child
process (inheriting the open file descriptor to the phone device)
that runs software expecting a sound card interface. While it's not
totally transparent, it's possible and should not actually be that
difficult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f213b8"></a>Asynchronous Event Notification</h2></div></div><p>Events that occur on the telephony side of the device need to
be communicated to the user-space software running the phone. Old
and crude methods for this required the software to poll the device
continuously for status and changes. The Linux telephony API avoids
that, of course, and provides two different techniques, both
generically called &ldquo;asynchronous event notification&rdquo;. The first
method uses signals for indication, and the second uses the
&ldquo;exception bit&rdquo; in the file descriptor set for exceptions. I'll
cover both techniques in order.</p><p>The use of signals for event notification requires three
steps: first, prepare and declare a signal handler function for the
SIGIO signal; second, set the process ID (PID) for the running
process to receive the signal; third, enable the generation of the
signal on the open files descriptor using the fcntl system call. An
excellent description of these steps can be found in Chapter 12 of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</em></span>
by W. Richard Stevens (a worthwhile book to have in any case).
Again, a short example will probably clear this up. Assuming you
have an open file descriptor ixj1 that is an open phone device, you
can enable asynchronous event notification with signals with the
following code snip:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
signal(SIGIO, &amp;getdata);
fcntl(ixj1, F_SETOWN, getpid());
oflags1 = fcntl(ixj1, F_GETFL);
fcntl(ixj1, F_SETFL, oflags1 | FASYNC);
</pre><p>and a related signal handling function
(<b  >getdata</b> in the code above) to process the data.
When you get the signal, you still do not know what kind of event
occurred&mdash;only that an event did occur. Your program would then
have to make an ioctl call to the phone device to ask what kind of
event was detected (more on this below). In addition, if your
program has more than one open phone device file descriptor, you
will not know which one generated the signal. And, signals can be
complicated to deal with and can be unreliable in a multi-threaded
program and, so, are avoided by some developers. These factors
limit the effectiveness of this method, leading to the more useful
case of using the &ldquo;exception bit&rdquo; in the file descriptor set for
exceptions.
</p><p>It's common for programs to set read and write exception sets
and then use the <span   class="bold"><b>select( )</b></span> system
call to wait for a file descriptor to be readable or writable. A
less well-known aspect of the select( ) call is the &ldquo;exception
set&rdquo;. The Linux telephony API uses this exception set to signal a
process that a telephony event has occurred. Listing 3 presents a
simple example using the file descriptor ixj1.</p><p><a href="4468l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Using an Exception
Set</a></p><p>This extremely simple (and not really useful) example is
purely to illustrate the technique of using the exception set and
select( ) to detect events. The phone device driver will set the
appropriate bit in the exception set if an event has occurred,
causing select( ) to return. The user can screen the read, write
and exception descriptor sets to determine if its own file
descriptor was marked by the device driver as ready for that kind
of operation. If data is ready to be read, the statement
<b  >FD_ISSET(ixj1,&amp;rfds)</b> will return
<b  >TRUE</b>;
<b  >FD_ISSET(ixj1,&amp;wfds)</b> statement returns
<b  >TRUE</b> if the device is ready to be written to.
And, if a telephony event has occurred, the
<b  >FD_ISSET(ixj1,&amp;efds)</b> will return
<b  >TRUE</b>. So, how do you detect what specific event
occurred?</p><p>The API provides a special PHONE_EXCEPTION ioctl call and an
associated telephony_exception structure to decode the return
value. This call will set bits in the structure that indicate which
of the telephony events occurred (there may have been several). In
the above example &ldquo;hookstate&rdquo; bit is examined in the statement
<b  >if(ixje.bits.hookstate)</b>, and if that bit is set
it indicates a change of status. An ioctl call is then made to
determine if the phone is on or off hook. Real-world code would
have used a large select or an extended if-else-if ladder to
examine the contents of ixje.bits after the PHONE_EXCEPTION ioctl
call. A detailed explanation of how to use this technique is beyond
the scope of this article, but please refer to the
<b  >/usr/include/linux/telephony.h</b> file for details
of what kinds of events can be detected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f21b48"></a>Open-Source Programs Available Now</h2></div></div><p>There are many open-source programs available now that use

supports the Linux telephony API, but it is also compatible with
other H.323-based products like Microsoft
NetMeeting&lt;+H&gt;tm&lt;+H&gt; and Cisco voice-enabled routers. A
more detailed discussion of this fine software is too much for this
article, but you're encouraged to look at its web site to catch the
latest news. The company that developed the OpenH323 library was
recently acquired by Quicknet Technologies, Inc. as part of
Quicknet's efforts to ensure continued major development effort of
this open-source project. With such full commercial backing and a
commitment to open source, I expect the OpenH323 Project software
to become even better in the near future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e30580.0x1f21d00"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Linux telephony API provides a common and consistent
interface for developing telephony software on Linux. While there
is currently only one vendor (Quicknet Technologies, Inc.) with
fully compliant drivers for this API, several others are working
toward compliant drivers. The API is lean, well designed, will not
conflict with the existing API for sound cards and provides the
ability to support multiple vendors behind the same interface.
There's sure to be some exciting new telephony software developed
for Linux in the coming year.</p><p><a href="4468s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
