    Loadable Kernel Module Programming and System Call Interception
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f7580.0x19ef818"></a></h2></div></div><p>Modern CPUs can run in two modes: kernel
mode and user mode. When a CPU runs in kernel mode, an extended set
of instructions is allowed, as is free access to anywhere in memory
and device registers. Interrupt drivers and operating system
services run in kernel mode. In contrast, when the CPU runs in user
mode, only a restricted set of instructions is allowed, and the CPU
has a restricted view of the memory and devices. Library functions
and user programs run in user mode. Kernel and user mode together
form the basis for security and reliability in modern operating
systems.
</p><p>Programs spend most of their time in user mode and switch to
kernel mode only when they need an operating system service.
Operating system services are offered through system calls. System
calls are &ldquo;gates&rdquo; into the kernel implemented with software
interrupts. Software interrupts are interrupts produced by a
program and processed in kernel mode by the operating
system.</p><p>The operating system maintains a &ldquo;system call table&rdquo; that
has pointers to the functions that implement the system calls
inside the kernel. From the program's point of view, this list of
system calls provides a well-defined interface to the operating
system services. You can obtain a list of the different system
calls by looking at the file
<b  >/usr/include/sys/syscall.h</b>. In Linux, this file
includes the file
<b  >/usr/include/bits/syscall.h</b>.</p><p>Loadable modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and
unloaded into the kernel on demand. Loadable modules add extra
functionality to the kernel without the need of rebooting the
machine. For example, it is common in Linux to use loadable modules
for new device drivers. The alternative to loadable modules is a
monolithic kernel where new functionality is added directly into
the kernel code. Monolithic kernels have the disadvantage of
needing to be rebuilt and reinstalled every time new functionality
is added.</p><p>Kernel programming can be difficult not only because of the
intrinsic complexity but also because of the long debugging cycle.
Debugging an operating system may require installing a new kernel
and rebooting the machine in every cycle. We strongly recommend
using loadable modules in kernel development because a) there is no
need to rebuild the kernel or to reboot the machine more often than
necessary; and b) since the end user does not need to
replace/rebuild the existing kernel, the user is more likely to
install the new functionality.</p><p>Loadable module support within the Linux kernel facilitates
the interception of system calls, and this feature can be taken
advantage of as described within the examples below. As a note, it
is assumed that the reader is familiar with C programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f7580.0x19efb88"></a>1. System Calls, an Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Operating systems provide entry points through system calls
that allow user-level processes to request services from the
kernel. It is important to distinguish between system calls and
library functions. Library functions are linked to the program and
tend to be more portable since they are not bound to the kernel
implementation. However, many library functions use system calls to
perform various tasks within the system kernel. To illustrate,
consider this C program that opens a file and prints its
contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
    FILE *myfile;
    char tempstring[1024];
    if(!(myfile=fopen("/etc/passwd","r")))
    {
         fprintf(stderr,"Could not open file\n");
         exit(1);
    }
    while(!feof(myfile))
    {
         fscanf(myfile,"%s\n",tempstring);
         fprintf(stdout,"%s\n",tempstring);
    }
    exit(0);
}
</pre><p>Within the program, we used the
<span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span> function call in order to
open the <b  >/etc/passwd</b> file. However, it is
important to note that fopen is not a system call. In fact, fopen
calls the system call <span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span>
internally in order to do the real I/O. To get a list of all the
system calls invoked by a program, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>strace</b></span> program. Assuming you have
compiled the above program as a.out by running gcc example1.c,
running strace like : <b  >strace ./a.out</b> will allow
you to see all the system calls being invoked by
<b  >a.out</b>.
</p><p>The kernel switches to the user-id of the process owner
invoking the system call. So, if a regular user were to run the
above program, with <b  >/etc/shadow</b> (which is not
readable) as the parameter to fopen, the open would fail and so
would fopen, causing the if clause above to translate to true, thus
printing the <b  >Could not open file</b> error
message.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f7580.0x19f0058"></a>2. Intercepting System Calls via Loadable
Modules, an Example</h2></div></div><p>Assume that we want to intercept the
<span   class="bold"><b>exit</b></span> system call and print a
message on the console when any process invokes it. In order to do
this, we have to write our own fake exit system call, then make the
kernel call our fake exit function instead of the original exit
call. At the end of our fake exit call, we can invoke the original
exit call. In order to do this, we must manipulate the system call
table array (sys_call_table). Take a look at
<b  >/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S</b>
(assuming you are on an i386 architecture). This file contains a
list of all the system calls implemented within the kernel and
their position within the sys_call_table array.</p><p>Armed with the sys_call_table array, we can manipulate it to
make the <b  >sys_exit</b> entry point to our new fake
exit call. We must store a pointer to the original sys_exit call
and call it when we are done printing our message to the console.
Source code to implement the above is as shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4378l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Example
2.c</a></p><p>Compile the program shown in Listing 1 by invoking gcc:
<b  >gcc -Wall -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DLINUX -c
example2.c</b>. This gives us our example2.o module. In order
to insert this module into the kernel, do this as root:
<b  >insmod example2.o</b>. Now, make sure you are on the
console (since <span   class="bold"><b>printk</b></span> only prints
to the console), and run any program which uses the exit system
call. For example, <b  >ls</b> should print:
<b  >HEY! sys_exit called with error_code=0</b>.</p><p>Next, try to invoke <b  >ls</b> with a file that
does not exist; this should cause <b  >ls</b> to call the
exit system call with an argument other than 0. Therefore,
<b  >ls somefilethatdoesnotexist</b> should print:
<b  >HEY! sys_exit called with error_code=1</b>.</p><p>In order to list all the modules loaded, use
<span   class="bold"><b>lsmod</b></span>. To remove the module, run
<b  >rmmod example2</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f7580.0x19f0840"></a>3. A More Interesting Example: Intercepting
sys_execve to Protect Against</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;root-kits&rdquo;
</p><p>After a machine is compromised, malicious users tend to
replace commonly used programs with trojan horses (programs that
execute malicious instructions in addition to their normal
functions). Packages of such trojan horses are widely distributed
over the Internet and are easily accessible by anyone. Therefore,
it becomes important to protect programs from being replaced by
malicious users.</p><p>In order to protect against such problems, our next example
involves the interception of various system calls, most importantly
<b  >sys_execve</b>, to check the hash of the program to
be executed against a known hash present in a database file. The
program is denied execution if the hashes do not match, and such an
attempt is logged. One way to implement this is seen in the
following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Intercept <b  >sys_execve</b> and compute
the inode of the file being executed, than compare it with the
inodes of the files present in the hash database. Inodes are data
structures that contain information about files in the file system.
Since there is a unique inode for each file, we can be certain of
our comparison results. If no match is found, call the original
<b  >sys_execve</b> and return. However, if a match is
found, compute the hash of the program and then compare it with the
hash present in the hash database. If they match, call the original
<b  >sys_execve</b> and return. If they do not match, log
the attempt and return an error.</p></li><li><p>Intercept <b  >sys_delete_module</b>. If
called with our module name as the parameter, return an error. Our
module cannot be deleted.</p></li><li><p>Intercept <b  >sys_create_module</b>, and
return an error. No more modules can be inserted because we do not
want any malicious module to be able to intercept the
<b  >sys_execve</b> described in step 1.</p></li><li><p>Intercept <b  >sys_open</b> to prevent
our hash database and log file to be opened for writing.</p></li><li><p>Intercept <b  >sys_unlink</b> to prevent
deletion of the hash database and log file.</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that the above does not offer complete protection, but
it is a simple first-step implementation. For example, a malicious
user may modify kernel symbols in <b  >/dev/kmem</b> or
use raw device access to the hard disk, and bypass open to write to
the hash database file. Also, since our implementation is only a
loadable module, a malicious user can alter our
<b  >/etc/rc.d</b> files and stop our module from being
loaded the next time the machine is rebooted. In addition, various
other system calls exist that could cause our hash database and log
files to be altered or deleted.
</p><p>At this time, it becomes important to acknowledge the
possibility of loadable module support being misused by a malicious
user. For example, the <b  >sys_execve</b> function call
can be intercepted to invoke a trojan program instead of the one
intended, and system calls such as
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> can be intercepted to
perform keystroke logging. Therefore, the flexibility and power of
loadable kernel modules can be misused by malicious users who may
have gained access to the system. See Resources for a web site that
has details of this example along with complete source code.</p><p><a href="4378s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="4378s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
