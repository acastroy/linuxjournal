Technology and resold by IGEL@USA
(<a href="http://www.igelusa.com" target="_self">http://www.igelusa.com/</a>),
are intended to be an easy introduction to Linux.
</p><p>The package I received had a boxed version of easySamba and
two CDR's of easyLinux, presumably the free-download version. It
also included product brochures on IGEL's Linux software products
(easyLinux and easySamba), hardware products (Linux thin clients)
and consulting and reseller programs.</p><p>The easyLinux setup program is graphical with 11 steps
required to install the software. After choosing my language,
keyboard and mouse type, I was asked for my experience level with
Linux: am I a novice, an experienced user or a Linux professional?
The choice determined which configurations it would let me choose
on the next screen. The professional choice provides the greatest
flexibility, allowing my system to be a stand alone PC, an
Internet-connected PC, a LAN client or a server.</p><p>At this point I could also choose whether I was installing on
a laptop (it wouldn't let me select a laptop installation if I
wanted a server) and how I wanted my GUI to appear&mdash;like Windows,
like traditional UNIX (Motif), like newer UNIX (CDE) or like a
Macintosh (Platinum). I chose Windows but noticed that I got a KDE
1 interface no matter which choice I made&mdash;only the widgets were
changed.</p><p>On to partitioning: this step is always a difficult one for
new users to grasp. The screen showed me all existing partitions on
both of my hard drives and allowed me to choose which ones to use
for easyLinux, along with whether to format them and where to mount
them. Also shown were the existing NFS mounts I had in my
<b  >/etc/fstab</b> directory from my previous
installation. These mounts were carried over into my new
installation, a nice touch.</p><p>Had I wanted to create new partitions, it gave me options to
run both its graphical fdisk tool or plain vanilla text-based
fdisk. It didn't allow me to install into an existing Windows
partition (as do Red Hat's, Slackware's and others partitionless
installs) so I chose an existing ext2partition and Linux swap
partition.</p><p>Next I was asked to choose my time zone and set up my
Ethernet card. After dutifully entering in this information, the
file copy started. During the file copy, which lasted about ten
minutes, a little penguin strolled around the screen giving advice
about easyLinux and telling me what it could do. This was
cute.</p><p>After the file copy I was asked how to install LILO. I chose
to install it in the Master Boot Record of
<b  >/dev/hda</b> and was told it needed to reboot. Time
to see what easyLinux looks like!</p><p>When the system rebooted I was presented with a nice KDM
login screen. I logged in as root (the setup program told me this
was the proper procedure, since no user accounts had been created
yet) and was given the opportunity to set a password. An 800x600,
16-bit KDE desktop greeted me with over a dozen icons and a help
screen. &ldquo;Step 1&rdquo;, it explained, &ldquo;Please start
<b  >eXs</b> to adjust the graphic card and monitor.&rdquo;
Beyond this was information instructing me to configure Ethernet
cards and load software (didn't I just do these during the
install?), add a normal user account, configure additional hardware
and create a rescue disk. Hmm, seven additional steps, two of which
are redundant, and then I will have a functioning easyLinux
system.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4472f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. After successfully loading easyLinux, I
was greeted with this desktop and told to run eXs, the X
configuration program. Here is the on-line help with eXs showing.
The desktop is KDE 1.1.2</p></div></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>eXs</b></span> couldn't get my display
to run at 1024x768x32, nor could it get 800x600 for my Trident
3dimage985 video card nor my CTX PR700 monitor (although both were
listed in the configuration program). I'm not sure whether this was
because it wanted to guess refresh rates (it wouldn't let me choose
any beyond <span   class="bold"><b>BEST</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>SAFEST</b></span>) or because it was using
XFree86 3.3.5, but I elected to stay with the working frame buffer
X server to which it defaulted.</p><p>A quick perusal of eEtherPro, the included Ethernet
configuration program, showed my install settings were intact, but
no driver was installed for my 3C905B network card.
<span   class="bold"><b>eAdapterDetect</b></span> to the rescue! It
found the card and installed the driver right off the bat. Now
eEtherPro had the adapter and could start the network
drivers.</p><p>The third step, install software, is really necessary because
the only standard application software I found loaded were two text
editors and two MPEG video players.
<span   class="bold"><b>eProfile</b></span>, the application loader,
gave me a list of hundreds of applications that I could load from
the included CD set. Without a &ldquo;select all&rdquo; option, I saw I would
have to check each of the hundreds of applications manually to get
a full system. I instead checked only a few games, Netscape and
sound and video support, and waited for it to install the 78
packages it calculated I would need (from dependencies and such).
After logging out and logging back in, the new programs showed up
in the menu.</p><p>It should be mentioned here that each time the easyLinux CD
is needed, a dialog pops up on the screen stating &ldquo;Please insert
easyLinux CD 1 (or 2).&rdquo; The CD automounts, using the BSD
automounter, <span   class="bold"><b>amd.</b></span> It works rather
well, except that eXs asked for the CD six times before it
recognized I already had it in the drive. I ended up ejecting it
and reinserting it, and it mounted fine. Sure beats <b  >mount
-t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom</b> and <b  >umount
/dev/cdrom; eject</b>.</p><p>Adding a user, with <span   class="bold"><b>kuser</b></span>,
was a simple task. Enter full name, user id, home directory,
password twice and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;!</em></span> Configuring a
printer brought up Netscape (which I luckily had just installed via
<span   class="bold"><b>eProfile</b></span>) but instead of getting a
printer control panel, I got Netscape search results for
&ldquo;localhost631&rdquo;. The CUPS administration service wasn't started; a
quick <b  >/etc/rc.d/init.d/cups start</b> later, and I
was back in business.</p><p>Well, sort of. The easyLinux help link to adding a printer
wasn't working, but as I figured it out manually I realized my
Canon BJC 4400 wasn't supported. The printing software was CUPS,
and being familiar with LPRng myself I didn't have the expertise to
work around it. Oh well.</p><p>Step six, hardware setup with
<span   class="bold"><b>eHardware</b></span>, let me install a sound
driver (OSS found my Sound Blaster 16, ALSA didn't). The OSS
autoprobe worked well. It would have allowed me to set up a
joystick, a TV tuner card and ISA PNP devices had I had any on this
system (I didn't).</p><p>I chose to skip the last step, create a rescue disk, because
I wanted to get to know my new system better. Under the hood, I saw
that this was an RPM-based glibc 2.1.3 system with KDE 1.1.2,
XFree86 3.3.5 and gcc 2.95.2. Kernel 2.2.16, Netscape 4.74, CUPS
1.1b5 and ALSA 0.5.8 were included. The server install, with the
games and multimedia utilities I installed, used 656MB on my hard
drive. The system didn't appear to be based on Red Hat or
derivatives, Caldera or SuSE, or at least it was disguised enough
that I couldn't tell.</p><p>The desktop, once I got playing around with it, seemed no
different than any other KDE 1.1.2 desktop. No tuning was done to
the desktop itself, other than to add a background image with their
logo and a few desktop icons. The biggest value adds I saw with
easyLinux were the configuration tools.</p><p>Beyond the installer and the configuration tools already
described, easyLinux bundles a disk wizard (mount new partitions),
an FTP setup wizard, an inetd wizard (start and stop inetd
services), an ISDN gateway wizard, a printer wizard (which would
allow me to install LPRng, but I couldn't get it to work), a RAID
wizard (build a RAID 1 mirror or Linear mode partition), a
graphical logfile viewer, a graphical kernel building utility, a
registry editor and a list of active services.</p><p>All in all, almost two dozen wizards or graphical
configuration utilities were included, all integrated with the KDE
desktop or configuration manager.</p><p>In my mind the question, &ldquo;If I were a new user, would I want
to use easyLinux?&rdquo; lingered. The second question, &ldquo;If I were a
new user, would I find value in the administration utilities
easyLinux has bundled?&rdquo; I could answer affirmatively. But the
larger question: &ldquo;Would I use this distro?&rdquo;&mdash;I'm not sure I
would. Here's why:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>There are a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of bugs. Some
are minor annoyances (such as the numerous spelling errors), some
are pesky, but not insurmountable (such as the X server not letting
me work at 1024x768) and some are pretty bad (easyLinux wouldn't
install at all on my laptop, giving me L 80 80 80 80 80 errors when
I booted with the CD). Instead of listing all of them here, I'll
just say I found dozens in the several hours I played with
easyLinux. For version 2.2 of their software, I had expected
better.</p></li><li><p>The dialogs in the graphical configuration tools
are nice but not intuitive. The colors weren't consistent, the
buttons weren't placed in the same location, the help icons were
scattered all over the dialogs and so on. Some didn't work at all
or needed a lot of tweaking to get working. It got very
confusing.</p></li><li><p>The on-line documentation has pretty good coverage
of the different topics but not much depth. Some of the help files
had links to files that didn't exist, but generally the help was
hard to follow.</p></li></ul></div><p>This distribution has a great concept, but in order to
execute well it could use some more polish. My advice to eIT: stop
kitchen-sinking. Remove some of the functionality of your
distribution and spend more time making what you leave in work very
well for the market you target. Having a single version of a distro
work for an Internet desktop, a stand-alone PC, a LAN client and a
network server, with customized GUI clients for each little bit of
configuration, is an enormous amount of work. Find out which
markets you wish to target and focus your distribution a little
more on those.
</p><p>Now to try easySamba. easySamba comes on one CD with a
70-page user manual. Twenty pages of the user manual describe how
to set up and configure easySamba, while the other 50 describe
Samba, the SMB protocol behind Samba and Windows networking and
list security issues with Samba and Windows 95 and Windows for
Workgroups (along with how to fix them).</p><p>easySamba claims it runs on easyLinux, SuSE, Red Hat and
compatible systems. I tried to load it on Redmond Linux, based on
Caldera, and even though it detected my system as being
Caldera-compatible, it didn't load correctly. I was using kernel
2.4.0-test10, glibc 2.1.95 and Samba 2.0.7, and it overwrote key
packages with older versions of the same package. Even after doing
so, it would not work correctly.</p><p>On my easyLinux system, easySamba installed, well, easily.
After inserting the CD into my CD-ROM drive I clicked on the setup
script, clicked the forward button and the finish button and was
presented with the Samba Wizard.</p><p>A few questions were asked: did I want a PDC (Primary Domain
Controller), a workstation or a workgroup computer? What did I want
for a domain name, and a description for this computer? Did I want
to use WINS (the Windows Internet Naming Service)? After entering
this and clicking Finish, I was presented with a screen showing the
Samba service installed but not active. I activated it and tried to
browse from another computer.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other computer was the one that easySamba
had failed to load on. Perhaps this was the reason I could not see
the easySamba server from this computer. I could see it from itself
using the <b  >smbclient -L</b> command, so I was fairly
sure the easySamba installation worked well.</p><p>At least, as a PDC it worked well. As a workstation it wanted
to know the name of the PDC and a Samba PDC wouldn't work. It had
to be a real Windows PDC, I gathered. A workgroup computer
installation worked well, but not the workstation
installation.</p><p>The Samba administration program
<span   class="bold"><b>sambaadmin</b></span> was added to the KDE
menu after a successful installation. This program allows
administration of Samba users, workstation accounts (on a PDC), and
file and printer shares. It also shows computers connected to that
host.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4472f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. easySamba's GUI configuration tool, samba admin, lets you
administer samba user and workstation accounts and file and printer
shares, as well as seeing which computers are attached to your
Samba server. The workstation option is grayed out because I chose
to do a workgroup computer install, so no workstation accounts were
needed.
</p></div></div><p>New file shares are created through
<span   class="bold"><b>kfm</b></span>, the file manager, similar to
the way they are done in Windows. Right click on a directory,
choose samba share and a dialog pops up asking for a name, a
comment, the path (with a default filled in) and which users are
allowed to access it. These new shares are automatically
accessible, without requiring a manual restart of the samba
service.</p><p>I created three file shares this way and attempted to edit
them via sambaadmin. For some reason only two of them showed up in
the GUI dialog, although <b  >smbclient -L</b> showed all
three. Strange.</p><p>Parsing through the <b  >/etc/smb.conf</b> file, I
noticed that password encryption and UNIX password synchronization
were enabled. No smbpasswd file was defined or populated, which
meant that if I had wanted to give my UNIX users Samba access
rights I would have to do it by hand. This is not a big deal unless
there are many UNIX users to add; I suppose someone in this
situation would rather have done this via a script than a GUI
anyway.</p><p>Security with a network service is always important to me. A
guest user, samba, was configured in the
<b  >smb.conf</b> file but not defined in the
<b  >smbpasswd</b> file. After creating a samba user I
tried to access a share but was denied due to bad name/password
pair. I grepped the logs to find the one easySamba
used&mdash;<b  >/var/log/syslog</b>&mdash;but couldn't get any
clues as to what was wrong. I created a blank password for the
samba user. Still no go. I made up a password for this user.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;</em></span>, it worked! Guest accounts
therefore must have a password. To me, a guest account is one
without a password, but I guess that isn't the way everyone
thinks.</p><p>I decided to forego heavy-duty security and usability
testing. The admin interface is fairly nice, and the bugs are
relatively minor. easySamba is a little easier to use than Samba's
native GUI configuration tool, SWAT, but the only significant value
add I see in easySamba is the ability to add file shares via a
right-click in kfm. Still, that feature is pretty cool in my
book.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4472f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. When administering user accounts with
easySamba, you can create normal users, administrative users,
enable and disable user accounts, delete users and change user
passwords.</p></div></div>
</p><p>If I were a small network administrator and wanted to set up
a Samba server, would I consider using easySamba? Yes, I would. It
generally works as advertised, and it's easy to use and load.
Further documentation is missing how to troubleshoot easySamba
would be a great addition&mdash;Why doesn't the guest account work? Why
can't I join an easySamba workstation to an easySamba domain? Why
don't all of my shares show up in the configuration tool? How do I
check the logs? What should I look for in the logs? Why doesn't the
send message button work when I am connected from my own computer?
and so on.</p><p>And, of course, it should prompt the user before overwriting
newer packages with older versions.</p><p><a href="4472s1.html" target="_self">The Good and the Bad</a></p></div></div>
