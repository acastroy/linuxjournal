    The role of Linux in the future of clustering.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23cf580.0x24c73a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ten years ago, clustering meant one
thing&mdash;grouping a small number of large servers together with
shared disks to host on-line transaction processing applications
with better availability and, in some cases, scalability. Since
then, we've seen the rise of internet-based applications and thin
commodity servers, and a whole new model of open, scalable,
distributed computing built upon Linux.
</p><p>Many vendors in the Linux space are working on reproducing
the kind of clustering that existed ten years ago on traditional
UNIX OLTP systems. This may not be the right strategy. Rather,
clustering should look toward the types of applications and
architectures that are being deployed in the internet data center
and on sets of thin Linux servers. In the internet data
center&mdash;whether in a hosting environment or in a
corporation&mdash;application architectures have several characteristics
that are fundamentally different from the architectures of the old
glass house. In particular, the internet data center architectures
share some important common themes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Architectures are multitiered (usually web servers,
application servers, and database servers).</p></li><li><p>Each tier may have literally dozens of
servers.</p></li><li><p>Each tier has unique requirements for shared and
replicated data.</p></li></ul></div><p>In a large e-business or web content site, managing the
entire distributed set of resources that provide a service over the
Web is a bigger challenge than simply providing failover for
individual servers.
</p><p>While some applications, like OLTP or some kinds of
e-commerce failover, still require shared disk solutions, modern
applications, in many cases, can take advantage of software-based
replication provided by middleware. What they lack is the
infrastructure to bind those solutions together and integrate them
in the larger computing environment. Application
management&mdash;including failover&mdash;remains one of the key problems
facing today's operations manager, but the options are,
fortunately, getting better.</p><p>The applications that do require shared access to data now
often involve dozens of machines, potentially in multiple Points of
Presence (POPs). This means that even the shared disk solutions of
traditional clustering, which are based on physically shared SCSI
connections, may not be adequate. Those solutions are bound by
physical cabling and SCSI address limitations and usually can only
service two or four systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23cf580.0x24c7870"></a>The Web Server Tier</h2></div></div><p>The web server tier, a stronghold of Linux, is characterized
by either read-only or dynamically created data. This data can be,
and often is, shared across multiple servers by using
network-attached storage appliances running NFS. Each server mounts
the NFS appliance and has access to the right data. For this tier,
complicated shared SCSI cabling schemes are totally
inappropriate&mdash;a TCP/IP network provides all the interconnect
between servers and storage. However, clustering software that can
monitor the health and performance of web servers, and take
appropriate actions based on the input from those monitors, is
still very important.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23cf580.0x24c7978"></a>The Application Tier</h2></div></div><p>In the traditional corporate glass house, applications were
typically client/server and were based on a relational database.
For the most part, data was not stored in the application
layer&mdash;everything was put in the database. The mix is much richer
in the Internet/Linux world. The emergence of Java and Enterprise
JavaBeans has led developers to serialize application-layer objects
in the file system, outside the database. In addition, applications
now manipulate a much richer universe of data&mdash;including digital
streaming media, text and other data types that are not naturally
stored in SQL back-ends.</p><p>For this reason, the applications layer has shared data and
failover requirements that will be met by neither network-attached
storager or shared SCSI. Network-attached storage typically does
not work because NFS protocols do not provide enough consistency
guarantees to be suitable where multiple servers may be writing the
same data. Shared SCSI is not sufficient because replication nor
sharing may need to happen across many systems or across multiple
POPs. In many cases, therefore, applications provide their own
replication. For example, consider a foreign-exchange trading
application in use at several dozen large banks. Replication of
real-time trading data is maintained at the application level,
combined with cluster-based failover.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23cf580.0x24c7ad8"></a>The Database Layer</h2></div></div><p>The database layer is the domain of traditional clustering
solutions from the big UNIX vendors&mdash;Sun, HP and IBM. Originally,
two servers would be connected to some SCSI disks, with one server
being an active master and the other being a passive standby. In
more modern implementations, multiple servers share a fiber channel
or SCSI storage system and use a parallel database like Oracle
Parallel Server (OPS) to manage concurrent access by each node in
the cluster.</p><p>However, high-end fiber channel SANs are expensive, as is
software like Oracle Parallel Server. Often, the price/performance
of these types of solutions are not appropriate for the thin server
Linux market or for the internet data center. The active/passive
SCSI approach is also wasteful of resources and suffers limited
scalability. Fortunately, there are other approaches more suited to
the kinds of applications being run on Linux.</p><p>For example, database vendors have put much effort into
shared-nothing software replication approaches (Informix
Replicator, DB/2 Replication, Oracle Multi-master and hot standby).
Using these tools, it is possible for multiple servers to
participate at the database tier without having shared storage.
However, the databases themselves often lack the facilities to
detect failure, sequence the actions to initiate failover and
guarantee application integrity. For this reason, they are best
paired with a clustering solution that provides these
services.</p><p>A real-life example is a chip fabrication facility running a
manufacturing automation application on Intel-based thin servers.
Because of the value of this application, the chip manufacturer
requires three-way replication, so that even if the primary fails,
there are two machines ready to take over. The solution chosen was
to use Informix database-replication services running on physically
separated machines without shared storage in conjunction with a
cluster management engine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23cf580.0x24c7ce8"></a>The Future of Shared Storage</h2></div></div><p>Finally, some applications do require physically shared
disks. However, because shared SCSI remains an unusual
configuration, putting together complete systems using this
approach requires care&mdash;often complete hardware/software system
certification by a vendor. (When was the last time you checked your
disk firmware level?) Even when this is all arduously put together,
as we have seen, there are severe limitations on both the number of
nodes that can share data over SCSI and possible physical cable
layouts. Fiber channel relaxes some of these limitations but comes
with drawbacks of its own, including steep price points, problems
with multivendor interoperability and a set of management issues
unfamiliar to many users of Linux thin servers.</p><p>The next year will see a huge change in the face of shared
storage. Industry leaders are pushing two new major storage
interconnects that will make shared storage available at a price
point appropriate for thin servers that will also support sharing
by large node counts seen in Internet data centers. Cisco and hot
startups like 3ware are backing SCSI-over-IP, which will allow SCSI
block protocols to run over a switched Ethernet fabric. Intel and
the server vendors are lining up behind a new I/O standard called
Infiniband. It will provide a switched I/O fabric that could
eventually be implemented in the chip sets included on every
commodity server motherboard. Indeed, these developments are
complementary&mdash;Gigabit Ethernet cards will be able to sit on the
Infiniband fabric and run the SCSI-over-IP protocols. As a
consequence, we can look forward to having dozens or even hundreds
of systems share storage over modern interconnects in the near
future. Clustering solutions that provide the basis for using these
interconnects to create truly manageable and scalable distributed
solutions out of sets of Linux boxes will set the tone for the data
center architectures of the future.</p></div></div>
