networking and the Internet. Linux distributions typically include
BIND, the Berkeley Internet Name Domain software, which handles
DNS. However, books about Linux usually don't provide much
information on using or configuring DNS.</p><p>While configuring BIND can be complicated, it is not
impossible. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux DNS Server Administration</em></span> by
Craig Hunt explains how DNS works and details the steps necessary
to configure it. Mr. Hunt is a noted TCP/IP and Linux expert, and
he has done a very good job of illuminating the inner workings of
DNS and explaining how BIND works with Linux.</p><p>The book contains twelve chapters and is divided into four
parts that explain how BIND and DNS work, basic DNS configuration,
advanced DNS configuration and how to maintain DNS once it is
running. Appendices and an index make up the rest of the
book.</p><p>The book is well laid out, and information is easy to find.
At the beginning of each section is an overview of the material in
the following chapters. Each chapter begins with a brief
introduction of the material that it will cover and ends with a
summary. A listing of all the code and example files is on the
inside of the front and back covers.</p><p>The first part of the book covers the DNS architecture,
protocols and the BIND software. The /etc/hosts file is explained
along with its uses and limitations. The DNS Hierarchy is
introduced along with an explanation of domains, searching for
domains and how queries are resolved. Datagrams are provided for
DNS messages and an explanation on how DNS databases are
synchronized is given. Next is a look at BIND installation and
control. The section ends with instructions for determining your
own DNS architecture requirements.</p><p>The second part covers DNS configuration and contains three
chapters. The first chapter explains what the resolv.conf,
host.conf and nsswitch.conf files are for and how they work. The
next chapter details the configuration of caching and slave servers
and provides suggestions on when to create them. The final chapter
explains how to create a master server, the one that is the
authority for a given domain and the most complicated. Each chapter
contains sample configuration files along with an explanation of
their contents.</p><p>Part three deals with advanced BIND configurations. Topics
covered include how to create nondelegated subdomains within a
zone, when to create delegated child zones and how to advertise
network services. This section also includes information on tuning
a DNS configuration for better performance. The section also
introduces the dynamic DNS (DDNS) protocol that promises to
eliminate the drudge work of DNS configuration by having the
computer create records from the information available on the
network.</p><p>The final part of the book is concerned with keeping a
running DNS system healthy and secure. The first chapter in this
section covers security and includes information on securing Linux,
securing the DNS configuration, coexisting with a firewall and the
DNS Security (DNSSEC) protocols. The next chapter explains how to
test and troubleshoot DNS, using commands such as
<span   class="bold"><b>host</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nslookup</b></span>. The final chapter covers
the BIND log files and explains how to configure logging to meet
specialized needs.</p><p>The book also contains four appendices. Appendix A introduces
the new features coming up in BIND 9 and contains brief
installation instructions for using the Beta 2 release. Appendix B
is a command reference for the named.conf file. Appendix C contains
descriptions of all the 41 types of resource records that BIND
supports. The final appendix explains how to configure a Network
Information Service (NIS) server.</p><p>I found this book relatively easy to follow and understand
and was able to set up a DNS server for my small network using it.
The book provides illustrations, definitions and sample
configuration files that clarify the text. Mr. Hunt does a very
good job of explaining how DNS works and how to configure and
maintain a DNS server with a good balance between general and
technical information.</p></div></div>
