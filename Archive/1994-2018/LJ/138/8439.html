Ultimate Linux Box Cooling?</h4><p>
I was impressed by the desire to make a quiet PC&mdash;more people should complain to their OEMs/System
integrators about this&mdash;it is the only way it will
be fixed [&ldquo;Ultimate Linux Box&rdquo;, August 2005]. But I am not sure that removing 100% of
the airflow is a positive thing for overall system
performance or stability.
</p><p>
I have seen motherboards designed where the processor
power supply components can exceed the design rating
from the suppliers without airflow. Even if things
don't go bad enough to cause system stability
issues, it can damage the processor by allowing
the CPU voltage to go out of specification. Intel
is so concerned about this&mdash;they are telling
motherboard manufactures to add circuits to the
motherboard to monitor the temperature of the
processor power supply and modulate the clock of the
processor if things get too hot. See Section 9.4 in
<a href="http://download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/guides/30235604.pdf" target="_self">download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/guides/30235604.pdf</a>.
</p><p>
Thanks&mdash;and looking forward to more sub-minute kernel compiles.

Linux/BSD Confusion</h4><p>
My child is almost two in the picture. The laptop is
running KDE on FreeBSD. He quite plainly CALLED it
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. My wife and I both looked at each other
and at him and he said it again. He has also said
&ldquo;Ethernet&rdquo;. We are afraid, very afraid.
Thanks for a (decade of a) great publication!

I'm used to reading the annual Ultimate PC article
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maximum PC</em></span> magazine each year, and they give a
great deal of detail and many more pictures than
the Ultimate Linux Box article [August 2005]. However, the big
difference between the two articles is that your
Ultimate Linux Box does much more customization.
</p><p>
The big question is, if I want to replicate the
Ultimate Linux Box, where would I get details on
the custom-made power supply cooler modifications?
</p><p>
I went to the Resources page, but many of the things I
would need to access require that I'm a <i  >Linux Journal</i>
subscriber. I have subscribed to the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
in the past, but for the last year, I simply run out
and purchase <i  >Linux Journal</i>.

soon. We'll look for more info on the power supply

Ten Years of Progress</h4><p>
The shock has worn off from seeing my name in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and I'm able
to write again. [See &ldquo;Ten Years Ago in <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;, July 2005, page 14.] Has it been
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ten</em></span> years since &ldquo;Novice to
Novice&rdquo; appeared
in <i  >Linux Journal</i>? It must be. I stopped writing the column after my
first child was born and&mdash;bless it!  &mdash;if it's not his tenth birthday
already.
</p><p>
And how much has Linux changed (and stayed the same) in ten years.
Though I haven't quite made the switch away from Microsoft, I did
recently install Fedora Core. In ten years, installation has vastly
improved since when I used version 0.99 of Slackware. The Fedora
installation was relatively fast and idiot-proof. Everything worked
except the modem, and although I'm finally getting DSL installed, I wanted
modem access as backup. Turns out I have a PCTel modem, which seems
unsupported by the 2.6+ kernel and by the drivers currently out there in
Webland.
</p><p>
(Hmmm, could be another &ldquo;Novice to Novice&rdquo; here.)
</p><p>
But what's blown me away about Linux are the live CDs. Knoppix and the
variations are fantastic not only for emergencies but also just to learn
*nix, which is why I got involved with Linux originally.
</p><p>
Ah well! Thanks for remembering me after all these years. Yes, I still
have the 0.99 Slackware CD with the grinning Bob. It just seems right to
keep it.

Become Boring and Pigeonholed, Please</h4><p>
Hi. I've been a subscriber to <i  >LJ</i> for several years,
and I've never figured out your niche. Servers,
or desktops? Sysadmins, application programmers,
system developers or home users? Your intention
seems to be: appeal to everyone. Unfortunately for
me, you cover so many different topics that there is
very little in each issue for me.
</p><p>
If you can't figure out your niche, I'll let my
subscription expire in January.

Ergonomic Comments on Ultimate Linux Box</h4><p>
The case on the cover for your Ultimate Linux Box
is gorgeous [August 2005]. Beautiful. Amazing.
</p><p>
It also blows. It's a terrible design. Ghastly.
Ideal for a computer show, but awful to use.
There's no legroom on the box. For many folks,
that would mean sitting obliquely or too far from
the keyboard&mdash;both would cause strain.
</p><p>
Tactile response acts as a brake reducing the amount
of impact on the end of the fingers (while, agreed,
increasing the finger travel) so the keyboard
used may actually increase hand-stress for some.
Its placement isn't adjustable for height, and that
can be catastrophic for arm stress.
</p><p>
On a much less important note, I'd point out that
the case puts the cooling up very high indeed, into
airspace often several degrees hotter than the rest
of the room.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Paul Pomerleau  <br><br>
</p><p>
The coolant loops need to run well above the
motherboard in order to get adequate convective
cooling. For daily use, you can build a tall case
without the monitor mounts or keyboard shelf.  &mdash;Ed.

Another Happy Reader</h4><p>
Here's a photo of my son Merit (about 26-months
old) sitting on his trusty fire truck checking out
my July 2005 issue of <i  >LJ</i>. When he was done, he went
back into the office and picked up an Advanced C
Programming book!

Pipe Tip</h4><p>
&ldquo;Text Manipulation with sed&rdquo; by Larry Richardson had some
useful hints [July 2005]. For instance, I wasn't aware of the ! modification
to the range field.
</p><p>
But writing to a file at the same time you are reading it is
decidedly dangerous. You are depending on the pipe buffer
between cat and sed to hold the entire contents of the
file. You are also banking on the assumption that cat
will be started and allowed to fill its buffer
<span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
the file is written and, therefore, truncated at zero length.
A far better way to do this is in two steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sed -e 's/$/ mycomputer/' &lt; /etc/exports &gt; tempfile \
&amp;&amp; mv tempfile /etc/exports

</pre>
</p><p>
The mv command is executed only if sed returns
without problems. You don't want to be overwriting important
files with the wrong data!

Her First Computer T-Shirt</h4><p>
My daughter (2.2-years old) made the transition.
She was introduced to Potato Guy and Tux Paint on my
Linux box. On this day, she learned everything she
needed to know about the mouse operations. A very
proud moment for me, she is on road to becoming
a geek just like her daddy. Elizabeth Su WOHID

sed Tip</h4><p>
I read with great interest the article by Larry Richardson entitled
&ldquo;Text
Manipulation with sed&rdquo; [July 2005]. We're in the early stages of porting a MS Access
application to Linux using MySQL and Qt to build the GUI. I've recently
been
working with sed, so the article hit the spot, so to speak.
</p><p>
One thing I noted missing from the article is the fact that when writing
commands that substitute one string with another, for example, using
slashes
to separate the from string and the to string is only one option.
Actually, any unique character could be used as a separator. In the
example
on page 81 (first column, second example), which reads:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat customer.txt \
sed -e 's/Sam Jones/Samuel Jones/' &gt; customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
The slashes could be replaced by the plus (+) sign (or most any other
unique
character) as in:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat customer.txt \
sed -e 's+Sam Jones+Samuel Jones+' &gt; customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
I've found this useful when I'm editing a file containing paths, such
as /etc/exports. In this case, the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat /etc/exports |
sed -e 's/\/windows/\/winNT/' &gt;/etc/exports

</pre>
</p><p>
reduces to:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat /etc/exports |
sed -e 's+/windows+/winNT+' &gt;/etc/exports

</pre>

Patent Searching</h4><p>
I've liked open software since the time it had no name
yet, when you were nearly a hacker because you had
a 1,200-baud modem and a dial-up connection to some
friend's BBS.
</p><p>
I'm writing from the old continent, where a battle
is being played between software companies who want
the ratification by the EU of the right for software
patents and developers who don't want to have
their mind and ideas limited.
</p><p>
And now the question:
I suppose that any person should be granted the same
rights as anyone else, but in the fight between open
software and non-open software there is a disparity.
Any company developing non-open software can check
any open software to look for similar, copyright
infringing, code. The same right is not granted to
the counterpart. How can we be sure that Microsoft,
Oracle, SAP or anyone else, is not importing code
and concepts from open-source software?
Maybe this issue has been discussed many times,
but I couldn't find a definitive answer to it.

I had a great father's day and hope all
the other open-source dads did too.
Of course, the best gift was Paige, my going-to-be-seven-in-September
daughter&mdash;and you will see she painted Tux on a rock for me this
father's day. She always has been a good drawer, and her favorite
program is Tux Paint with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> a close second.

LDAP Question</h4><p>
I just found your OpenLDAP article on
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> [July 2005]. I notice you include the
nis.schema, but you don't use NIS at all, correct?
Thanks for any clarification.

Jiann-Ming Su  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Craig Swanson replies:</b></span>
thank you for your interest in &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere
Revisited&rdquo;. You are
correct that we are not using Network Information System (NIS). The
nis.schema provides several essential attribute types that are used in
our LDAP directory. For example, nis.schema defines the LDAP entries
that take the place of fields in /etc/passwd. For background
information on the history of NIS and LDAP, see the IETF RFC2307, &ldquo;An
Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service&rdquo;.
