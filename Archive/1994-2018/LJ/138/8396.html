<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #138, October 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

After a long and difficult life, <span   class="bold"><b>DevFS</b></span> is finally
being removed from the Linux kernel. Created by
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Gooch</b></span>, DevFS has been around for years, and
it represented a serious attempt to cure the runaway
/dev directory. Developing DevFS was an uphill battle
against many detractors, but Richard did succeed in
creating a very useful tool. In the end, however,
critics of DevFS won out, citing &ldquo;unfixable races&rdquo;
and other problems, and Richard vanished from kernel
development completely. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and others
then developed udev as a replacement for DevFS. Some
lingering sense of the 2.6 kernel as a stable tree
has made this decision slightly controversial even
now, but almost certainly it's not enough to influence
the outcome. Farewell DevFS&mdash;it was a valiant effort.
</p><p>
Recently, various folks have reported compilation
problems when trying to compile the <span   class="bold"><b>2.4
kernel</b></span> with
GCC version 4, and some developers have posted patches
to address these issues; however, <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo
Tosatti</b></span> has
stated that it is simply too late in the day for these
sorts of patches to make it into the 2.4 tree. Unlike
2.6 development, the maintainers of 2.4, 2.2 and 2.0
have not decided to follow suit and abandon the idea
that their trees must aim for stability. Marcelo has
been trying to rein in 2.4 development ever since
the first 2.6 kernel came out, but he has still
allowed large IDE changes, new hardware support
and other patches whose invasiveness would typically
fly in the face of a push for stability. And with 2.6
development showing no sign of slowing down, Marcelo
has been under constant pressure to incorporate
new features into 2.4 to be available to folks who
needed 2.4's stability. With the advent of the w.x.y.z
tree, however, some of this pressure has undoubtedly
flagged, and Marcelo has been able to tighten up the
restrictions on what can and cannot get into 2.4 at
this late date.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> versioning system continues to grow
and strengthen. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>'s -mm tree will be
available as a git repository, although Andrew himself
has no plans to use any versioning tool for actual
development. The <span   class="bold"><b>ALSA</b></span> Project has migrated development
to git, as has <span   class="bold"><b>libata</b></span>. Marcelo Tosatti's 2.4 tree
also will use git for ongoing development. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>
is still very strongly involved with the project,
and although mailing-list traffic has tapered off
somewhat from its frantic early weeks, much of this
is explained by the fact that folks now understand
the basics of the tool, and the fundamental concepts
no longer need to be explained to newcomers.
</p><p>
In the midst of all the version-control upheaval,
it's hard to know for certain if the new w.x.y.z
stable kernels are working out. But several kernel
folks, including <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, feel that
this tree successfully provides a stable kernel
to supplement the 2.6 tree's ongoing large-scale
development. Greg Kroah-Hartman and <span   class="bold"><b>Chris
Wright</b></span>,
the primary maintainers of the w.x.y.z tree, do seem
to be doing a rigorous job, not only collecting
and applying patches, but adhering to Linus Torvalds'
strict guidelines on what patches may be applied,
and how and when they may be accepted. A number of
aspects make this project less appealing than doing
real development work, but Chris and Greg seem
to be bearing up nicely, and the rest of us are the
beneficiaries.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Martin J. Bligh</b></span> has put together a set of automatic
testing scripts that compile and boot all official
kernel releases (including the w.x.y.z kernels)
and several prominent branches like the -mm tree,
within 15 minutes of their release. If a kernel
boots successfully, Martin's scripts hit it with a
variety of benchmarks. Compilation and boot results
are recorded, benchmark results are graphed and
everything is made available as a set of ongoing
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> Web pages. This is the sort of project
that will not solve all bugs, but it will identify
many trivial bugs, track performance problems
across multiple kernel releases and may identify
hard-to-find bugs that regular users would not
normally see.
</p><p>
The relatively recent introduction of <span   class="bold"><b>Signed-Off-By</b></span>
tags in kernel patch submissions has made a huge
difference in providing a trail of authorship, so
that if anything like the SCO lawsuit occurs again,
it will be easy to prove who wrote any disputed
source code. This was, in fact, Linus Torvalds'
stated purpose in introducing the Signed-Off-By
header. When first introduced, the idea was quite
amorphous, with few details settled. Since then,
various wrinkles have been introduced to improve
its usefulness. One of the most recent of these is
the addition of a From header as the first line of
the body of patch e-mails. This header identifies the
true author of a given patch. Before this wrinkle,
the true author was assumed to be the person with
the bottom-most Signed-Off-By header. This, however,
became confusing and was not always adhered to. The
From header is intended to leave no doubt as to
the original authorship of a given patch.

<h2 class="title">Bringing Usability to Open Source&mdash;And Vice Versa</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #138, October 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

&ldquo;Usability&rdquo; is one of the big raps on the reputation of
open-source
code. Fixing that reputation at the source(s) is the idea behind a
series of FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) Usability Sprints. The
first was held in San Francisco February 2005. By the time you read
this, the second will have happened in July 2005. Others will follow.
</p><p>
The organizers of the first and second events were Blue Oxen Associates
(<a href="http://blueoxen.org" target="_self">blueoxen.org</a>) and Aspiration (<a href="http://aspirationtech.org" target="_self">aspirationtech.org</a>), two nonprofits with
a mutual interest in improving usability.
</p><p>
At Digital ID World in May 2005, I met with Eugene Eric Kim of Blue Oxen and
interviewed him briefly about what the whole thing was about.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: What were your motivations for the first Sprint?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: The motivation for the event was multilayered. We wanted to figure
out a way to make open-source software more usable. Both Blue Oxen
Associates and Aspiration believe strongly in open source and use it
ourselves, so we had a strong stake in the outcome. Both of us also care
strongly about nonprofit organizations and believe that poor usability
is one of the impediments for wider adoption of open source among
nonprofits.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: Why a &ldquo;sprint?&rdquo;</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: A sprint is a hands-on and collaborative clinic where everybody
works hard for three days to get real stuff done and learn new things in
the process.
</p><p>
There's a knowledge gap between the usability and the open-source
communities; but the problem is actually that the two communities
weren't previously motivated to learn about each other and to close that
gap. It's a bit ironic, because these two communities share a lot of
values: iterative improvement, user-centrism, a desire to improve
things. They <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> have been collaborating with each other, but they
weren't. Our goal was to build shared understanding between these two
communities and then to see what happened.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: How did you select participants?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: We started with the largest and most diverse possible group: six
open-source projects (Activist Mobilization Platform, Chandler,
CivicSpace, FotoNotes, Identity Commons, OpenACS and WordPress), 12
usability specialists (OSAF, Sun, Adobe, Adaptive Path,
openusability.org, Stanford and Oracle) and a mix of developers and
project managers&mdash;for a total of 40 people.
</p><p>
Our stated goal was straightforward and concrete&mdash;for each group to
improve the usability of some aspect of their projects in three days. On
the second day, we brought in about 15 users to help the process.
</p><p>
Our unstated goal was to catalyze ongoing collaboration between these
two communities. The event was highly interactive and was expertly
facilitated by the good folks at Aspiration (who also do Penguin Day and
other excellent events). We emphasized concrete outcomes, reporting out
and self-documenting on our Wiki.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: What did you get out of it?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: We accomplished both of our goals and then some. Each project
improved in concrete ways. Everyone learned something. Open-source
developers learned practical usability techniques, but more importantly,
they were <span   class="emphasis"><em>motivated</em></span> to learn more. This wasn't training. It was
learning by doing. The difference is critical. A follow-up bootcamp will
be much more effective if the developers are motivated and if they have
a context from which to understand these techniques.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: What did the two constituencies learn from each
other?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: The usability folks learned a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> about open-source development.
There were many misconceptions, both ways. It built shared understanding
to work closely together in such an intense, high-energy,
accelerated&mdash;and, most importantly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> environment. Curiously, the usability folks
hungered for an opportunity like this. For one thing, most usability
practitioners never collaborate with each other. They have good
professional groups, such as CHI and UXnet, but they rarely work in
twos. A lot of folks approached me afterward and said how much they
enjoyed working with other usability people. These usability folks also
hungered to do some good and make an impact. One problem with usability
in corporate environments is that you can't talk about your work. Maybe
you can point to a final product, but you can't point to the analysis
and methodologies that got you there. You also can't show how crappy the
project was before you came along.
</p><p>
So, a huge benefit for usability practitioners to work with open-source
projects is simply the ability to talk about it afterward.
</p><p>
Both sides learned that usability and open source have an inherent
tension. The usability mantra is, &ldquo;You are not your own
user.&rdquo; The open-source mantra is, &ldquo;Scratch your own itch.&rdquo; On the surface, these two
philosophies seem contradictory. But, if you dig deeper into both of
these, you'll find that it's not that simple. We gained confidence that
collaboration will help resolve these tensions.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: Did any new projects come out of the event?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: Two interesting and unexpected concepts and projects emerged from
the event. The first was the notion of &ldquo;extreme usability&rdquo;. See,
usability is like security; it's not something you can just tack on at
the end. The best route to usable software is to incorporate it into the
process from the very beginning. As all of us explored this notion
further, we converged on this analog to pair programming, where you
partner a usability person with a developer. This resonated strongly
with a lot of folks.
</p><p>
The project I'm most excited about is called OpenWebGUI
(<a href="http://openwebgui.sourceforge.net" target="_self">openwebgui.sourceforge.net</a>), because it shows the kinds of
unique and powerful collaboration that open source enables. We had three
CMSes there, and throughout the weekend, they realized that they were
faced with similar usability problems. For example, all of them wanted
more usable administrative systems. Even though they are all different
systems, the functionality and work flow is essentially the same. These
projects realized&mdash;independently of any of us&mdash;that because they
were faced with the same problem, they were better off working together
than in silos. They started a project called OpenWebGUI, which will
focus initially on CMS administration GUIs. They will do an analysis,
develop some HTML prototypes and test those. The tested and usable HTML
files will be released under an open-source license, so that any CMS can
incorporate them and customize them as they see fit. I love this outcome
because it vividly illustrates the exponential returns that open source
enables. We spent a bit of money to improve these projects, and yet the
outcome will very likely improve the entire ecosystem of related
projects. Now that's ROI!
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DS: How else do you expect this to play out in the long
run?</em></span>
</p><p>
EK: Many folks involved with CHI are interested in
being more involved with open source, and we are
actively working to facilitate this. Jan Muehlig,
a usability specialist who flew in from Germany
to participate, has an outstanding project called
OpenUsability.org, where he's trying to connect
usability folks with open-source projects. Jan did
some excellent work with KDE, and we're actively
trying to promote his stuff. And, we've got a long
list of projects and people who want to participate in
the next sprint, at the end of July. We'll incorporate
what we learned from this past sprint to improve the
next one, and we'll also experiment with some new
ideas. And we'll continue to engage with the community
as a whole. These events are meant to perturb the
ecosystem and catalyze the community. We encourage
everybody to participate.

When <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zork</em></span> appeared on the scene in the late 1970s,
computer enthusiasts from around the world were
instantly hooked on the interactive fiction genre
known fondly as the Text Adventure game.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HLA Adventure</em></span> is the latest in a long line of public
domain and free software text adventures being
released by people all over the world. It combines
elements from <span   class="emphasis"><em>MUD</em></span>s, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Dungeons
&amp; Dragons</em></span>
and J.R.R. Tolkien's famous <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></span>.
</p><p>
Using verbs and nouns to communicate with the game
world, the player moves about <span   class="emphasis"><em>HLA Adventure</em></span> with but a
simple goal in mind: slay the menacing dragon at the
end of a large expanse of caves. While solving this
main quest, the player is also presented with nine
other unique quests, which allow the player to find
items and equip weapons, armor and a brightly lit
lantern. Even a magical flute plays a role&mdash;useful in
putting magical beasts to sleep.
</p><p>
Players will encounter hellhounds, werewolves,
vampires, hobbits, ghosts, barbarians and demigorgons.
Talk to creatures in the game with the <tt  >TALK TO</tt>
command. Once you have acquired the necessary
armament and passed the requisite number of quests,
you can then enter into the cave and slay the dragon
for good.
</p><p>
Despite some bugs in the game, <span   class="emphasis"><em>HLA Adventure</em></span> is a
solid, robust open-source adventure game. It was
written in Randall Hyde's High-Level Assembly (HLA)
programming language.

<h2 class="title">Might Be Just Right</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #138, October 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

At LinuxWorld in Boston earlier this year, I got together with an old
Swedish friend. She's a nurse, not a technologist, but she was curious
about my work and the conference that brought me to town. Somewhere in
the midst of my explanation of Linux and its virtues, she said, &ldquo;Ah,
Linux is lagom&rdquo;. She explained that <span   class="emphasis"><em>lagom</em></span> is a Swedish term that
conveys a sense of balance, proportion and appropriateness. &ldquo;Not too much,
not too little...just right.&rdquo;
</p><p>
When I told her that Linus Torvalds' first language and surname were
both Swedish, she said, &ldquo;Well of course. There you go.&rdquo; (I'm
half-Swedish myself, though I'm not sure that matters.)
</p><p>
So I put the question &ldquo;Is Linux logom?&rdquo; to The Man Himself
in an e-mail.
He debugged my spelling and declined to commit:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Lagom, with an &ldquo;a&rdquo;.
</p><p>
And yes, it means &ldquo;just right&rdquo;, in the sense of &ldquo;not too much, not
too little&rdquo;. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom</a>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he added, in a following e-mail:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
They still end up confusing &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; with finding
the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; amount. That's pretty much missing
the point. It's not that something is &ldquo;lagom&rdquo;
because it's the best possible or &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;.
Quite the reverse. Something being &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; very
much involves not caring too much about what the
optimal amount even is. Or possibly questions
where &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; simply doesn't make sense.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So I began checking other sources. The best I found was from &ldquo;In Other
Words&rdquo;, published in AskOxford, published by the Oxford English
Dictionary (<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/otherwords" target="_self">www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/otherwords</a>). It lists
lagom
among a handful of &ldquo;the most insightful, intriguing, and satisfying
expressions on the planet&mdash;for which there are no English
equivalents&rdquo;.
It says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Swedish commentator Dr Bengt Gustavsson argued that the lagom
mentality can be seen as the trait that gives Swedish society its
characteristic stability and yet an openness to external influences.
The word alludes subconsciously to the avoidance of both conspicuous
success and humiliating failure, which is deeply ingrained in the
Swedish psyche. It is the inclination among Swedes to shun
ostentation, accept modest rewards, be good team players&mdash;to fly
beneath the radar.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beneath the Radar</em></span> was also the title of Bob Young's book about
starting and guiding Red Hat to success. Coincidence?
</p><p>
Perhaps characteristically, Linus adds these final words to the matter:
&ldquo;but whether that applies to Linux I have no idea.&rdquo;
</p></div>

<h2 class="title">Nigel McFarlane</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">John Allsopp</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #138, October 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

With the sudden death of Nigel McFarlane, the Web
Development and Open Source Software communities,
both in Australia and around the world, have lost
one of their most well-known authors, consultants
and pundits.

</p><p>
Although in many ways a very private person, Nigel had a professional
and personal network that spanned the globe and included such on-line
luminaries as the lead engineer for the open-source browser Firefox
Ben Goodger, and countless others in the Open Source, Web Development
and Linux communities. Since his passing, many community sites, in
a number of languages, have expressed their sorrow, a testament to
Nigel's influence.
</p><p>
A real Melbourne boy, describing the city proudly as &ldquo;the World's most
liveable&rdquo;, Nigel had science degrees from both the University of Melbourne
and LaTrobe University. Even when speaking in Sydney, he was always keen
to get home as soon as possible, where he would bushwalk and ramble,
swim and surf.
</p><p>
Nigel forged a global reputation from his beloved
Melbourne, in a way impossible until the 1990s. Many
others have and will follow his lead, but as with
much of what he did, here, too, Nigel was a pioneer.
Since 1997, Nigel had become well
known and respected in the Web Development and
more recently Open Source Technology communities
through the publication of several successful
books on JavaScript, Mozilla and most recently, the
increasingly popular free open-source browser Firefox.
</p><p>
Two earlier books on JavaScript, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Instant JavaScript</em></span>
in 1997 and the co-authored <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional JavaScript</em></span>
in 2001, are still considered by many to be among
the best books on the subject. More recently,
the benchmark <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rapid Application Development with
Mozilla</em></span>, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Firefox Hacks</em></span> carved out a place in
the increasingly important Open Source community.
</p><p>
Nigel's writing extended to the columns &ldquo;Searching
for Substance&rdquo; for <span   class="emphasis"><em>InformIT</em></span>, and articles for such
publications as <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DevX</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Builder.com</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CNet</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Age</em></span> and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></span>.
Nigel was an entertaining speaker as well as a writer.
I particularly recall chairing a conference session that
Nigel presented late last year. Often conference-goers
are anxious to get early places in the meal queue,
but although we had gone overtime for lunch, Nigel
captivated the room. When offered the opportunity to
break, the entire room turned it down, glued as they
were to Nigel's presentation.
</p><p>
Generous with his time, energies and knowledge, Nigel contributed to
mailing lists, newsgroups and forums, as well as speaking to audiences
large and small at conferences and for user groups. His reach went
far beyond Australia, as tributes in recent days from developers and
members of the Open Source and Web Development communities around the
world testify.
</p><p>
Nigel's passing is a sad loss for these industries still in their infancy.

To go along with this month's theme of Personal Desktop, here are some
articles from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site that will
help you find your way through OpenOffice.org, try out some Linux audio
software and rescue data from a hosed USB device:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Do you want to move to OpenOffice.org but aren't sure
what to expect? Are you trying to convince friends and/or family members
to give OOo a try, but they want to know about the learning curve? If
so, Bruce Byfield's article &ldquo;OOo Off the Wall: What New Users Need to
Know About OpenOffice.org&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8443" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8443</a>) is suggested reading.
Bruce sheds some light on OOo's &ldquo;interface shortcomings&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the limits of
its on-line help&rdquo;, as well as the &ldquo;logic of its interface design and the
importance of styles and templates in an efficient work flow&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio for Linux has come a long way in the past couple of years, and Dave Phillips
continues his tour of what's new for musicians and engineers, whether
full-time or part-time. In recent months, he's introduced us to
FreeWheeling, &ldquo;a powerful loop-based performance tool&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8445" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8445</a>), as well as QSynth and

The October 1995 issue covered &ldquo;Text Processing&rdquo;,
and feature articles introduced groff, LaTeX and
Linuxdoc-SGML, which was an early document format at
the Linux Documentation Project.  All three document
formats are still in use today.

Making the transition to 64 bits is IT news today, but
it was a hot topic for us ten years ago.  Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall, then still at Digital, covered Linux on Alpha
and its advantages for computer science education:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Over time, this meant that to get all the sources to
our Unix products, 15 separate licenses were necessary,
at a cost of thousands of dollars, and even then the sources
were restricted to a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis and were
not for consumption by curious students.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Publisher Phil Hughes, in a &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo; item,
pointed out that Microsoft Windows 95 overwrites
a PC's Master Boot Record&mdash;the first Windows
version to do so and a FAQ for dual-booters ever
since. More help came in the form of an ad for the
&ldquo;System Commander&rdquo; boot manager, which offered an
easy solution for multi-OS systems, with the bonus
feature of fixing boot sector virus infections.

At Parrs Wood OSS is seen not as merely a way of saving money, but
rather of spending it more effectively.

When I switched from Windows to GNU/Linux (Redhat/Fedora/Debian mostly)
about 5 years ago, I found a vast developer's playground. It was like
the old days of Compuserve, which was a candy aisle of freeware. Free
software is still like that for me, there's lot of it to explore, and I
can see the source code without significant restriction. I can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the
source, and I can share the source...which is something geeks love to
do. The Windows world by the mid-1990s was very closed (still is mostly),
something that's really restrictive as a developer.

You have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become
uninterested in money, compliments or publicity.
