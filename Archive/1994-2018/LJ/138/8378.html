Buried under a mass of sticky notes? If you worry about forgetting
important tasks or you want to schedule things efficiently, here
are some ways to get organized.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11772f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I offer some ways to manage your tasks.
From simple text files to full-blown personal information managers
(PIM), there's bound to be one method that fits your way of working. I
also share some tips on managing your tasks and tell you about how I
fit a task manager to my way of working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11773f8"></a>
You Want the Works</h2></div></div><p>
If you're accustomed to the advanced task management
features of Microsoft Outlook and other proprietary
PIMs, then Ximian Evolution and the KDE PIM suite are
great fits for you. Ximian Evolution was developed
for the GNOME user environment, and the KDE PIM suite
is part of KDE, but each is usable with other
desktop environments.
</p><p>
Offering a polished interface for creating and managing tasks,
attaching files and even synchronizing with personal digital
assistants (PDAs), these full-fledged personal information managers
can help you tame your to-do lists (TODOs) in style.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1177558"></a>
You Want to Keep Things Simple</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes the simplest method is the best. Keep tasks in a
plain text file, and you're already well on your way
to taming your TODOs. Text files win in terms
of flexibility. You can keep your list in any format
you want and edit them using your favorite editor. You
also can share them with others through e-mail or the
World Wide Web. You even can keep them backed up and synchronized
with other computers using tools such as rsync and CVS.
</p><p>
Memorize keyboard shortcuts for copy and
paste. Incremental search is a great way to jump
to tasks if you remember a small part of the
description. Your text editor then can display matches as
you type in characters. Check out your text editor's
features for more help.
</p><p>
Beyond the basics, a little bit of programming makes TODOs easier
to keep. Write a small program or shell script
to add items from the command-line or a keyboard
shortcut. The less effort it takes to write down a
task, the more you'll remember, so automate as much
as you can. You can sort tasks manually by copying
and pasting lines in your TODO list or even writing
programs to put everything together.
</p><p>
For more software support, check out Freshmeat.net for hundreds of simple
TODO managers. If you know how to program, pick a TODO manager in a
language you know or would like to learn. Extending a manager's capabilities
not only helps you grow as a programmer but also lets you tailor it
to your particular quirks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1177768"></a>
You Get Most of Your Tasks through E-mail</h2></div></div><p>
E-mail is a popular way to keep track of tasks. If you practically live
in your e-mail client, why not use it to keep track of the things you
need to do? You can forward messages or write yourself reminders. Use
meaningful subjects to make it easier to get a bird's eye view of your
messages.
</p><p>
Watch out for information overload, however. You may need to find that urgent
TODO in an archive of thousands of messages. Check out your mail
client's features for options of how to tag messages. Use folders or labels to flag
messages for follow-up action. Tag or file messages as TODO, and
remove the label or change it to &ldquo;done&rdquo; after you finish the task.
Keeping track of tasks is easier with full-fledged PIMs, such as Evolution
and KDE PIM, which allow you to mark a message for follow-up or convert
it to a task.
</p><p>
What about small tasks? It might seem silly to e-mail yourself a
reminder to buy milk, but unless all of these TODOs are written down
somewhere, you're going to spend mental energy thinking about them.
You therefore may need to supplement your Inbox with a way to keep track of
smaller tasks.
</p><p>
If most of your tasks can be accomplished quickly and you can keep
your inbox manageable, e-mail is a convenient way to keep track of
your tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11779d0"></a>
You Work with a Lot of People on Tasks</h2></div></div><p>
Many software projects use request trackers to make sure that bug
reports and feature requests don't slip through the cracks. You can
use one to keep track of your personal TODOs too.
Although a request
tracker requires a lot of set up time and effort, you reap the
benefits of a solid project management system.
</p><p>
Request trackers, also known as bug tracking systems
(BTSs) or issue trackers, archive all of the messages
related to a TODO, making them great for tasks occurring over
long periods of time and tasks where you need to
collaborate with other people. You can send the
e-mail address or URL for a task to other people so
they can confirm your work or add comments.
</p><p>
Request trackers can produce task-related graphs. For example, you can
track the increase or decrease in open, resolved and closed tasks over
time to get a rough estimate of when you're most productive or
overloaded.
</p><p>
If most of your tasks require input from others, check out programs
such as RequestTracker and Bugzilla. With a good bug tracking system in
place, you easily can keep track of what you're waiting for and from
whom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1177be0"></a>
You Practically Live in Your Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
Web-based TODO lists are a fun and easy way to create task lists you can
share with other people. If you always have a Web browser open or you need
to keep non-techies updated, a Web-based TODO list might be a handy way to
keep track of your tasks. New services such as Ta-da and Backpackit use
Javascript and XHTML tricks to provide a great user interface.
</p><p>
Look for a bookmarklet or extension that lets you easily create
TODOs. Make your task overview the default page in your browser so that
you're sure to review them daily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1177d40"></a>
You're Always on the Move</h2></div></div><p>
If you spend a lot of time on the move, you've probably thought about
getting yourself a PDA. Both Evolution and KDE PIM can synchronize
your tasks with Palm-based PDAs, making them ideal for the mobile
warrior. Libraries such as coldsync can help you support synchronization
for your custom hacks.
</p><p>
My productivity tool of choice is a pack of 3"x5" index cards held
together with a fold-back clip or rubber band. Affectionately called
the &ldquo;Hipster PDA&rdquo; by productivity geeks, this surprisingly effective
low-tech tool is a great way to keep track of tasks.
</p><p>
Write down your tasks, one per index card. You can write down subtasks
and notes as well. Shuffle through your tasks while waiting or
sort it by the context you can perform the tasks in. Rip the card up after
completing your TODO for an extremely satisfying end.
</p><p>
Print useful data onto cards. Around 50 names and contact numbers can
fit on an index card if you use a really small font. Month and year
calendars also are handy. No hardware worries, no productivity-sapping
games and no hassles makes the Hipster PDA great for people on the go.

Tips for Taming your TODOs</h2></div></div><p>
Got an idea about what to use to manage your tasks? Well, now here
are some tips for keeping on top of everything.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11780b0"></a>
Make It as Easy as Possible</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Hmm, that looks interesting&rdquo;, you think. &ldquo;Let's try
it out.&rdquo; You
switch to your task manager to write down that TODO. Oops, you still
need to open the application. Now you have to arrange your windows so
you can see the article. Wait, you need to copy the URL. By the
time you have it all set up, you might've forgotten what you wanted to
write down in the first place!
</p><p>
If a task manager is too cumbersome to use, you won't bother with it.
Make it as easy as possible to get a task out of your head and into
the system. Make your task manager a keystroke or click away, and
you'll find yourself using it more often.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11782c0"></a>
Don't Get Overwhelmed</h2></div></div><p>
Keep your TODO list short so that you don't
get overwhelmed by all the things you need to
do. Ruthlessly prune TODO items you no longer have
to do or are no longer interested in doing. Delete
or archive completed tasks so that they don't clutter
your main task list.
</p><p>
TODO items can be intimidating. &ldquo;Write a novel&rdquo;
is an example of a task that can be difficult to
start. Make sure your TODO items are small enough to
work on. I usually break my tasks down into subtasks
I can do in one sitting. Breaking these tasks down
also makes it easier to stop procrastinating, because
there's always something small to work on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1178478"></a>
Fill in the Cracks</h2></div></div><p>
Make a system you can trust. Ensure none of the tasks fall through the
cracks. Make your reminder system the first thing that shows up after
you log on or start your browser. Set aside time to review all of your
tasks regularly.
</p><p>
If your task manager is easy to use, you'll trust it with more tasks.
Writing down all of your tasks in a reliable system means you don't
have to worry about forgetting anything&mdash;as long as you don't forget
to check!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x11785d8"></a>
Hack Your System</h2></div></div><p>
The way you keep track of tasks probably will change as you come up
with new ideas or read about other people's experiences. Don't be
afraid to improve your system. Instead of making a giant step to a
brand new methodology, however, break changes down into incremental
improvements. That way, you give yourself time to make it a habit.
</p><p>
Don't spend too much time tweaking your system, though! One way to
manage this impulse is to find a community of like-minded people. That
way, you can use their hacks and customizations without having to
spend a lot of time coming up with your own. The trick is to find a
personal information manager that fits the way you work and can be
extended as you experiment with new ways of working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x1178738"></a>
A Truly Personalized Personal Information Manager</h2></div></div><p>
I went through the whole spectrum of personal information managers
before I found something that works for me. I'm absolutely crazy about
Planner.el, a personal information manager that's extremely
customizable. I'd like to share some of the things I love about it
with you so that you can see how personal work style affects how you
plan.
</p><p>
I spend most of my time working with text files in the Emacs text
editing environment. Because Emacs is so extensible, it has
accumulated a lot of useful modules along the way, including several
e-mail clients, Web browsers, Internet relay chat (IRC) clients and
even instant messengers. I can program, surf, chat and check mail
within Emacs. Emacs itself runs on GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and
Mac OS X and is surprisingly easy to learn.
</p><p>
Planner.el is built into my main working environment, making it only a
keystroke away. Because most of my tasks are based on what I'm looking
at, I really appreciate how Planner.el stays out of my way. When I
create a task, a small text prompt shows up at the bottom of my
screen (Figure 1). I don't get distracted by pop-ups or switching to another
application. I simply type the task description in, tag it with a
project or two and get back to work.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8378f1.large.jpg"><img src="8378f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You can create a task using a small text prompt in
your regular editing window.
</p></div></div><p>
Not only that, it also intelligently picks up information from
whatever I'm looking at, automatically creating a hyperlink back to
the file, e-mail, Web page or even IRC session (Figure 2). Even newbies can add
support for new tools, thanks to extensive examples. Planner's ability
to hyperlink to my mail messages is the only way I can impose order on
the thousands of messages in my mail archive!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8378f2.large.jpg"><img src="8378f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Hyperlinked tasks give you an easy way to
refer back to information related to a task, whether
in the form of a file, mail message, Web page or
IRC session.
</p></div></div><p>
I like reviewing my week to see what I have accomplished. Because it's
easy to view completed tasks, I can write accomplishment reports
without struggling to remember what I did the other day. Seeing a lot
of crossed-out tasks for today also is a great morale booster. As a
nifty bonus, I can keep detailed logs of how much time I spend on each
task or project&mdash;great for billing time, improving my time estimates or
simply finding out how (un)productive I am each day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x116f5a0"></a>
Manageable, not Overwhelming</h2></div></div><p>
I like keeping my task list short. I typically have fewer than ten
tasks on my task list for any given day. I like scheduling tasks for
particular days and organizing them according to projects, keeping my
daily task list small and manageable. When I feel particularly
productive, it's easy to reschedule more tasks onto today's page.
</p><p>
I break tasks down into bite-size bits to simplify keeping track of my
progress and to motivate me to work. When tasks are of a manageable
size, they're much easier to work on. Instead of goofing off, I find
myself picking the next small task from my list and working on it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x116f700"></a>
Trustworthy</h2></div></div><p>
I need a system that can keep track of small tasks as well as large
projects. Because Planner.el is only a keystroke away and I use it for
all of my tasks, I trust that it holds all the things I need to
remember. I made Planner.el the first thing that shows up when I turn
on my computer, and I check it at least once a day. Knowing that all of
my reminders are safe and can be checked easily from one place
definitely takes a load off my mind.
</p><p>
It's also easy for me to back up my files. Because Planner.el uses plain
text files, I don't have to worry about corrupted data. If some
experimental code makes Planner.el unusable for me, I still can use
any text editor to manage my plans. In addition, it's easy to publish my task list
and notes as HTML (Figure 3), so if something happens to my laptop, I can check
my TODOs using any computer with Net access.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8378f3.large.jpg"><img src="8378f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Publishing to the Net lets you check your
tasks from any platform, anywhere.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x116fa18"></a>
Extremely Customizable</h2></div></div><p>
My method of planning has really changed over the years. I went from
micromanaging my schedule by assigning specific times to tasks to
keeping an unsorted list on my day page. I tried both keeping one big
list of tasks and using projects to group together related tasks.
Sometimes I think up weird things, too, such as having my computer
automatically display a fortune cookie whenever I finish a task.
</p><p>
This is where Planner.el really shines. Because it's built on top of
Emacs, I can change anything I want through a simple, easy-to-learn
programming language. I've tweaked it to fit not only my planning
style but also my little quirks. Although my planning style has
changed much in the past three years, being able to replace bits of
Planner.el and add new features has made it possible for Planner.el to
grow along with me.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107f580.0x116fb78"></a>
Things to Remember</h2></div></div><p>
There are many ways to manage your tasks, so spend some time finding
one that fits you. Here are some things to remember:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Make it as easy as possible. Use keyboard shortcuts and scripts to
simplify task creation and review.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't get overwhelmed. Keep your task list short and simple. Don't
drown in hundreds of TODOs or choke on intimidating tasks.
</p></li><li><p>
Fill in the cracks. Put all of your important tasks in there. If you
can, put minor tasks in as well. Check your list regularly.
</p></li><li><p>
Hack your system. Keep an eye out for ways to improve your way of
planning. Don't spend too much time hacking your system and not
enough time actually accomplishing your TODOs, however.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Have fun!
