Users&mdash;what will they plug in next? Robert is making
the computer make sense of hardware, so you don't have to.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the better part of a decade, Linux enthusiasts
have waxed poetic on the inherent greatness and
looming success of Desktop Linux. Our kernel
is so robust! Our applications are infinitely
configurable! This is the year of Desktop Linux! Who
would ever use Microsoft Windows? These claims and
similar&mdash;particularly when made back in the 20th
century&mdash;seem, in retrospect, so trite. Not that I
stand righteous&mdash;oh no, I laid the praise down as
thick as anyone else did. I too was a convert.
</p><p>
At least, I did until I realized that hardware
support in Linux was <span   class="emphasis"><em>awful</em></span>. Like a deck of
cards, my rosy view of Desktop Linux came crashing
down, making an 180 degree turn from glowing to
ghastly. Heartbroken, I cried myself to sleep every
night and went on an inexplicable diet consisting
only of cheese and pudding.
</p><p>
But this did not last long. One day, the Linux community decided to
do something about it. We outlined a plan not only to reach feature
parity with the other desktop operating systems, but also to surpass
them. Hardware support has come a long way in the last year and a
half. This is the story of just how far.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee450"></a>
A Past Since Forgotten</h2></div></div><p>
The steps for installing a new hardware peripheral on a Mac might go a
bit like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Step 1: plug hardware in to Mac.
</p></li><li><p>
Step 2: begin using hardware.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Most of us would not even include these two items as steps. The first is
a physical necessity; the second is the original and ultimate goal. Lost,
somewhere between steps one and two, are 39 other steps, right? Kernel
modules? Configuration files? Rebooting? Extensive mastery of sed
and awk?
</p><p>
At some point in Linux's history, support for new hardware could
easily require compiling a new kernel module, becoming root, editing
configuration files, loading said module, checking dmesg, cursing,
removing the module, unplugging the hardware, plugging the hardware back
in, reloading the module and so on.
</p><p>
Forgotten, perhaps clouded by a love for free software and the
invigoration of <span   class="emphasis"><em>do it yourself</em></span>, is the notion that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>stuff should
just work</em></span>. As fun as writing my own kernel module might
be&mdash;and I
use the term fun here loosely&mdash;sometimes I just want to plug in
my camera, get my photos and be done with it.

A Call for Change</h2></div></div><p>
In late 2003, the Linux system was well primed for the emergence of a
new architecture for managing hardware on the desktop. The 2.6 Linux
kernel was out and rapidly gaining adoption. It brought, among numerous
other new features and improvements, a new mechanism for handling device
drivers, called the device model. The device model allowed, for
the first time, the kernel to build an in-memory tree of the devices
it supported. For example, both my mouse and my keyboard are connected
to my USB hub, which is connected to my third USB port, which is on my
first PCI bus. Such a rich hierarchy provides all sorts of opportunities
to the kernel. One of the most promising, however, was sysfs.
</p><p>
sysfs exports this device hierarchy as a filesystem. One directory lists
all the buses on a system. For each bus, another directory lists all
of the devices on a given bus. Files for a given device could link to
the associated module. Walking the sysfs tree, therefore, would allow
user space to build a comprehensive picture of the system's physical
device hierarchy, exactly as the kernel sees it.
</p><p>
That alone is incredibly useful. But another kernel feature,
hotplug, broadened the horizon even more. The kernel's hotplug
infrastructure notifies user space whenever a device is added to or
removed from the system. This allows applications to become aware of
changes to sysfs in real time. It also allowed for the creation of
udev.
</p><p>
udev is a user-space implementation of devfs&mdash;an automated and dynamic
manager of device nodes. Instead of a /dev created once,
statically, udev updates /dev on the fly, in response to the
exact hardware available to the system. More important, however, is
that udev places intimate knowledge of devices and their device nodes
in user space. Hotplug, sysfs and udev together allow user space a
complete view of the system's hardware.
</p><p>
Now user space needed to capitalize on the opportunity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1deeb30"></a>
Enter HAL</h2></div></div><p>
This was 2003. That summer, I attended a BOF at the Ottawa Linux Symposium
on improving the Linux desktop by Robert Sanford Havoc Pennington. In
the BOF, Havoc referenced a whitepaper of his entitled &ldquo;Making Hardware
Just Work&rdquo;, in which he unveiled a utopian view of hardware management
on the Linux desktop. Intrigued, I took notes&mdash;see Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7745f1.large.jpg"><img src="7745f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Early Project Utopia Notes
</p></div></div><p>
We ended up speaking to the group on this utopia and discussing possible
implementations. The BOF ended without much traction from the audience,
but Havoc and I had a firm understanding of the situation and potential
solutions. Other responsibilities kept me from immediately acting on my
crude sketches, and so they sat idle on the pages of my notebook.
</p><p>
Two things happened that lifted the pages to life without my immediate
realization.
</p><p>
First, David Zeuthen, then living in Copenhagen, decided to bring Havoc's
documents to life by beginning the HAL Project. HAL, originally
hardware abstraction layer but now not an abstraction of anything
whatsoever, is a system-level d&aelig;mon that ties together hotplug, sysfs
and udev in order to provide a Linux system with a single, comprehensive
view of hardware, accessible via a standardized interface. HAL makes it
possible for an application to say, &ldquo;give me the device nodes of all input
devices&rdquo; or to ask, &ldquo;is there a camera connected to this
computer?&rdquo; With
HAL, what was once a hundred lines of hacks, operating on hard-coded
device nodes with intimate knowledge of Linux internals, is now a single,
elegant HAL request. David's HAL, in effect, brought a 21st century
hardware infrastructure to Linux.
</p><p>
The second disruptive event came in December of the same year, when I
accepted a job with Ximian, recently acquired by Novell, as a kernel
hacker dedicated to the desktop. My first mission was to figure out the
hardware situation. I teamed up with a colleague, the inimitable Joey
Shaw, an Ohio native, and we sat down and hashed out our utopian view
of hardware management.
</p><p>
Both Joey and I recognized the strong foundation that the 2.6 Linux
kernel, sysfs, hotplug, udev and now HAL supplied. We concluded that
the missing pieces were the layers on top of HAL. We had a rich
infrastructure in place; we just had to do something with it.
</p><p>
HAL uses a then-nascent but always-promising project called D-BUS as
its communications mechanism. On one side, D-BUS is a run-of-the-mill
interprocess communication (IPC) system&mdash;like CORBA, but a lot easier
to use. On the other side, however, D-BUS introduces the concept of the
system-wide message bus. In addition to per-user process-to-process
communication, D-BUS allows components in a Linux system to send out
signals, announcing events or providing information to all who care to
listen. Signals can announce when a network connection is obtained or
when the laptop battery is running low. Interested applications higher
up the stack can listen for these signals and, upon receipt, react.
</p><p>
Our plan was literally to flood the system with D-BUS signals. Have HAL
and other lower-level components of the Linux system generate numerous
useful signals and have higher-level components respond, evolve
and react. In effect, make the Linux system much more dynamic and,
ultimately, make hardware just work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1def160"></a>
A Project All about Utopia</h2></div></div><p>
Joey and I decided to create an umbrella project&mdash;a meta-project. The
plan was to spur development of HAL-aware applications that can provide
hardware policy on the desktop. Never should a user need to configure
hardware. It should happen automatically in response to the user plugging
the hardware in. Never should the user (or even the programmer) have to
mess with device nodes and esoteric settings. HAL should provide all
of that, on the fly, to the applications. Never should the user have
to guess how to use new hardware. If I plug in a camera, my photo
application should run. If I insert a DVD, it should start playing. All
of this should happen magically, automatically and cleanly.
</p><p>
I coined the name Project Utopia. It was, after all, a bit utopian.
</p><p>
We did not have a central Web site or source repository or cute
logo. Project Utopia was a cause and a way of thinking. We had a goal and
a set of use cases and a growing disgust toward things not working. We
blogged and spoke at conferences and wrote code. One by one, piece by
piece, we started to build a set of policy pieces on top of HAL, guided
by the following rules:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Make hardware just work.
</p></li><li><p>
Use HAL, udev, sysfs and 2.6 Linux kernel as our base.
</p></li><li><p>
Tie it all together with D-BUS.
</p></li><li><p>
No polling, no hacks&mdash;everything should be event-driven and
automatic.
</p></li><li><p>
Carefully divide infrastructure into system and user level.
</p></li><li><p>
System level should be platform-agnostic; user level, GNOME-based.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1def790"></a>
GNOME Volume Manager</h2></div></div><p>
I began writing GNOME Volume Manager in late December 2003. It was
originally a proof of concept&mdash;a test bed for my ideas. I wanted to
see how feasible hardware management on top of HAL could be. The plan
was to respond to events such as &ldquo;new hardware&rdquo; or
&ldquo;audio CD inserted&rdquo;
with specific actions. GNOME Volume Manager is nothing but a simple
finite state machine, receiving hardware-related events on one end and
replying with hardware-induced actions on the other. The tricky part
was to do it all with HAL: no polling, no hacks.
</p><p>
GNOME Volume Manager implemented the Project Utopia policy related
to block devices. When the user inserted an audio CD, GNOME Volume
Manager would play it. When the user inserted a USB keychain device,
GNOME Volume Manager would mount it and open a Nautilus window. When
the user plugged in a camera, GNOME Volume Manager would ask if it
should automatically import the photos into the user's photo management
application (Figures 2 and 3). A recently added feature even found GNOME
Volume Manager managing iPods!

The Rest of the Puzzle</h2></div></div><p>
The next step was bringing HAL support to more applications, a process
Joey and I call halification. The following months witnessed
additional policy pieces, such as automatic printer configuration and
seamless network management (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7745f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. NetworkManager's Network-Switching Applet
</p></div></div><p>
For printers, Joey wrote a HAL back end for CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing
System, allowing CUPS to query HAL on the availability of printers. The
result: plug in a printer and configure it automatically, on the spot.
</p><p>
The ambitious NetworkManager Project, started by hackers at Red Hat,
aimed to solve networking woes. Seth Nickell, an early designer on the
project, described the intended use case as an electrical outlet: &ldquo;you
plug it in and [it's] on.&rdquo; For example, plug a laptop in to a docking
station, and it instantly switches to the station's Ethernet. Walk
into your favorite coffee shop and instantly begin using the wireless
networking. NetworkManager made networking simple, automatically choosing
the optimal solution for networking connectivity.
</p><p>
NetworkManager's architecture is two-part. First, a root-level d&aelig;mon
sits alongside HAL, responding to HAL events and communicating with the
system's networking hardware. Second, one or more user-level components
implement policy and provide a user interface. Together, the components
provide a complete solution for networking. Figure 5 is a diagram of
the architecture.

Today</h2></div></div><p>
Today, the Project Utopia mindset continues to foster new applications,
interesting hacks and fresh projects aimed at making hardware just
work. Linux distributions from Novell, Red Hat and others sport
powerful HAL-based infrastructures. The GNOME Project is integrating
HAL and D-BUS across the board. The Project Utopia cause is spreading
beyond GNOME too, as other platforms implement HAL-based solutions in
a similar vein.
</p><p>
Linux development has never stood still, however. Like a rabid
cheetah, development sprints forward toward better, faster, simpler
solutions. Support for new hardware continues to roll in, and solutions
in the spirit of Project Utopia are continually implemented to provide
a seamless user experience.
</p><p>
Cute hacks such as having your music player mute when your
Bluetooth-enabled cell phone receives a call are not a dream but the
reality in which we live. What cute hacks will tomorrow bring? What new
hardware will we support next? What application will be halified
next? Join in and answer those questions yourself!
