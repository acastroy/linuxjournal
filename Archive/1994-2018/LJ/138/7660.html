Take a tour of the kernel's networking functionality
by writing a network client that runs in kernel space.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x15674a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
All Linux distributions provide a wide range of
network applications&mdash;from d&aelig;mons that provide a
variety of services such as WWW, mail and SSH to
client programs that access one or more of these
services. These programs are written in user mode
and use the system calls provided by the kernel
to perform various operations like network read
and write. Although this is the traditional method of
writing programs, there is another interesting way
to develop these applications by implementing them
in the kernel. The TUX Web server is a good example of
an application that runs inside the kernel and serves
static content. In this article, we explain the basics
of writing network applications within the kernel and
their advantages and disadvantages. As an example, we
explain the implementation of an in-kernel FTP client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x15675b0"></a>
Advantages and Disadvantages of In-Kernel Implementations</h2></div></div><p>
Why would one want to implement applications within the kernel?
Here are a few advantages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
When a user-space program makes a system call, there is some
overhead associated in the user-space/kernel-space transition. By
programming all functionality in the kernel, we can make gains in performance.
</p></li><li><p>
The data corresponding to any application that sends or receives
packets is copied from user mode to kernel mode and
vice versa. By implementing network applications within the
kernel, it is possible to reduce such overhead and increase
efficiency by not copying data to user mode.
</p></li><li><p>
In specific research and high-performance computing
environments, there is a need for achieving data transfers at
great speeds. Kernel applications find use in such situations.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
On the other hand, in-kernel
implementations have certain disadvantages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Security is a primary concern within the kernel, and a large class
of user-mode applications are not suitable to be run directly in
the kernel. Consequently, special care needs to be taken while
designing in-kernel applications. For example, reading and writing
to files within the kernel is usually a bad idea, but most
applications require some kind of file I/O.
</p></li><li><p>
Large applications cannot be implemented in the kernel due to
memory constraints.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1567b30"></a>
Network Programming Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Network programming is usually done with sockets. A socket serves as a
communication end point between two processes. In this article, we
describe network programming with TCP/IP sockets.
</p><p>
Server programs create sockets, bind to well-known ports, listen and
accept connections from clients. Servers are usually designed to accept
multiple connections from clients&mdash;they either fork a new process to
serve each client request (concurrent servers) or completely serve one
request before accepting more connections (iterative servers). Client
programs, on the other hand, create sockets to connect to servers and
exchange information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1567c90"></a>
FTP Client-Server Interaction</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a quick look at how an FTP client and
server are implemented in user mode. We discuss
only active FTP in this article. The differences between
active and passive FTP are not relevant to our
discussion of network programming here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1567d98"></a>Socket Programming Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Here is a brief explanation of the design of an FTP client and server.
The server program creates a socket using the
<tt  >socket()</tt> system call.
It then binds on a well-known port using <tt  >bind()</tt> and waits for
connections from clients using the <tt  >listen()</tt> system call. The server
then accepts incoming requests from clients using
<tt  >accept()</tt> and forks a
new process (or thread) to serve each incoming client request.
</p><p>
The client program creates a control socket using
<tt  >socket()</tt> and next
calls <tt  >connect()</tt> to establish a connection with the server. It then
creates a separate socket for data transfer using
<tt  >socket()</tt> and binds
to an unprivileged port (&gt;1024) using <tt  >bind()</tt>. The
client now <tt  >listen()</tt>s
on this port for data transfer from the server. The server now has
enough knowledge to honor a data transfer request from the client.
Finally, the client uses <tt  >accept()</tt> to accept connections from the
server to send and receive data. For sending and receiving data, the client
and server use the <tt  >write()</tt> and
<tt  >read()</tt> or <tt  >sendmsg()</tt> and
<tt  >recvmsg()</tt>
system calls. The client issues <tt  >close()</tt> on all open sockets to tear
down its connection to the server. Figure 1 sums it up.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7660f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The FTP protocol uses two sockets: one for control messages and
one for data.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x15685d8"></a>
FTP Commands</h2></div></div><p>
Here is a list of a few the FTP commands we used.
Because our program provides only a basic implementation
of the protocol, we discuss only the relevant
commands:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The client sends a <tt  >USER &lt;username&gt;\r\n</tt> command to the server to
begin the authentication process.
</p></li><li><p>
To send the password, the client uses <tt  >PASS
password\r\n'</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
In some cases, the client sends a PORT command to inform the
server of its preferred port for data transfer. In such cases, the
client sends <tt  >PORT &lt;a1,a2,a3,a4,p1,p2&gt;\r\n</tt>. The RFC for FTP
requires that the a1&ndash;a4 constitute the 32-bit IP address of the
client, and p1&ndash;p2 constitute the 16-bit port number. For example, if
the client's IP address is 10.10.1.2 and it chooses port 12001 for
data transfer, the client sends <tt  >PORT
10,10,1,2,46,225</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Some FTP clients request, by default, that data be transferred in
binary format, while others explicitly ask the server to enable
data transfer in binary mode. Such clients send a <tt  >TYPE
I\r\n</tt>
command to the server to request this.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Figure 2 is a diagram that shows a few FTP commands and their
responses from the server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7660f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The client issues FTP commands over the
control connection to set up the file transfer.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1961010"></a>
Socket Programming in the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Writing programs in the kernel is different from doing the same in
user space.
</p><p>
We explain a few issues concerned with writing a network application in
the kernel. Refer to Greg Kroah-Hartman's article &ldquo;Things You Never
Should Do in the Kernel&rdquo; (see the on-line Resources). First, let's examine how a
system call in user space completes its task. For example, look at the
<tt  >socket()</tt> system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sockfd = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);
</pre>
</p><p>
When a program executes a system call, it traps into
the kernel via an interrupt and hands over control
to the kernel. Among other things, the kernel
performs various tasks, such as saving contents
of registers, making changes to address space
boundaries and checking for errors with system call
parameters. Eventually, the <tt  >sys_socket()</tt> function in
the kernel is responsible for creating the socket of
specified address and family type, finding an unused
file descriptor and returning this number back to
user space. Browsing through the kernel's code
we can trace the path followed by this function (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7660f3.large.jpg"><img src="7660f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Behind the scenes of a system call: when
user space executes socket(), the kernel does necessary
housekeeping and then returns a new file descriptor.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x19614e0"></a>
Design of an FTP Client</h2></div></div><p>
We now explain the design and implementation of
a kernel FTP client. Please follow through the code
available at the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site (see
Resources) as you read through
the article. The main functionality of this client
is written in the form of a kernel module that adds a
system call dynamically that user-space programs can
invoke to start the FTP client process. The module
allows only the root user to read a file using FTP.
The user-space program that calls the system call in
this module should be used with extreme caution. For
example, it is easy to imagine the catastrophic
results when root runs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./a.out 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 foo_file /dev/hda1/*
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1961698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and overwrites /dev/hda1 with a downloaded file
from 10.0.0.1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x19617a0"></a>
Exporting sys_call_table</h2></div></div><p>
We first need to configure the Linux kernel to allow us to add new system
calls via a kernel module dynamically. Starting with version 2.6, the symbol
<tt  >sys_call_table</tt> is no longer exported by the kernel. For our module to
be able to add a system call dynamically, we need to add the following
lines to arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.c in the kernel source (assuming
you are using a Pentium-class machine):

<pre     class="programlisting">
extern void *sys_call_table;
EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_call_table);
</pre>
</p><p>
After recompiling the kernel and
booting the machine into it, we are all set to run the FTP client. Refer
to the Kernel Rebuild HOWTO (see Resources) for details on compiling a kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x19619b0"></a>
Module Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Let's examine the code for the module first. In the code
snippets in the article, we omit error-checking and other irrelevant
details for clarity. The complete code is available from the
<i  >LJ</i> FTP site (see Resources):

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;

/* For socket etc */
#include &lt;linux/net.h&gt;
#include &lt;net/sock.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/tcp.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;asm/uaccess.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/file.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/smp_lock.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/slab.h&gt;

...

int ftp_init(void)
{

    printk(KERN_INFO FTP_STRING
    "Starting ftp client module\n");
    sys_call_table[SYSCALL_NUM] = my_sys_call;
    return 0;
}

void ftp_exit(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO FTP_STRING
    "Cleaning up ftp client module, bye !\n");
    sys_call_table[SYSCALL_NUM] = sys_ni_syscall;
}

...

</pre>
</p><p>
The program begins with the customary include directives. Notable among
the header files are linux/kernel.h for KERN_ALERT and linux/slab.h, which
contains definitions for kmalloc() and linux/smp_lock.h that define
kernel-locking routines. System calls are handled in the
kernel by functions with the same names in user space but are prefixed with
<tt  >sys_</tt>. For example, the
<tt  >sys_socket</tt> function in the kernel handles the
task of the <tt  >socket()</tt> system call. In this module, we are using system
call number 223 for our new system call. This method is
not foolproof and will not work on SMP machines. Upon unloading the
module, we unregister our system call.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x146f580.0x1961cc8"></a>
The System Call</h2></div></div><p>
The workhorse of the module is the new system call that performs an FTP
read. The system call takes a structure as a parameter. The structure is
self-explanatory and is given below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
struct params {
    /* Destination IP address */
    unsigned char destip[4];
    /* Source IP address */
    unsigned char srcip[4];
    /* Source file - file to be downloaded from
       the server */
    char src[64];
    /* Destination file - local file where the
       downloaded file is copied */
    char dst[64];
    char user[16]; /* Username */
    char pass[64]; /* Password */
};
</pre>
</p><p>
The system call is given below. We explain the relevant details in next
few paragraphs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

asmlinkage int my_sys_call
(struct params __user *pm)
{
    struct sockaddr_in saddr, daddr;
    struct socket *control= NULL;
    struct socket *data = NULL;
    struct socket *new_sock = NULL;

    int r = -1;
    char *response = kmalloc(SNDBUF, GFP_KERNEL);
    char *reply = kmalloc(RCVBUF, GFP_KERNEL);

    struct params pmk;

    if(unlikely(!access_ok(VERIFY_READ,
                 pm, sizeof(pm))))
        return -EFAULT;
    if(copy_from_user(&amp;pmk, pm,
       sizeof(struct params)))
        return -EFAULT;
    if(current-&gt;uid != 0)
        return r;

    r = sock_create(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,
                    IPPROTO_TCP, &amp;control);

    memset(&amp;servaddr,0, sizeof(servaddr));
    servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    servaddr.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    servaddr.sin_addr.s_addr =
        htonl(create_address(128, 196, 40, 225));

    r = control-&gt;ops-&gt;connect(control,
             (struct sockaddr *) &amp;servaddr,
             sizeof(servaddr), O_RDWR);
    read_response(control, response);
    sprintf(temp, "USER %s\r\n", pmk.user);
    send_reply(control, temp);
    read_response(control, response);
    sprintf(temp, "PASS %s\r\n", pmk.pass);
    send_reply(control, temp);
    read_response(control, response);

</pre>
</p><p>
We start out by declaring pointers to a few <tt  >socket</tt> structures.
<tt  >kmalloc()</tt> is the kernel equivalent of
<tt  >malloc()</tt> and is used to
allocate memory for our character array. The array's response and reply
will contain the responses to and replies from the server.
</p><p>
The first step is to read the parameters from user mode to kernel
mode. This is customarily done with <tt  >access_ok</tt> and
<tt  >verify_read/verify_write</tt> calls.
<tt  >access_ok</tt> checks whether the user-space pointer is valid to be referenced.
<tt  >verify_read</tt> is used to read
data from user mode. For reading simple variables like
<tt  >char</tt> and
<tt  >int</tt>, use <tt  >__get_user</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that we have the user-specified parameters, the next
step is to create a control socket and establish
a connection with the FTP server. <tt  >sock_create()</tt>
does this for us&mdash;its arguments are similar to
those we pass to the user-level <tt  >socket()</tt> system
call. The <tt  >struct sockaddr_in</tt> variable
<tt  >servaddr</tt>
is now filled in with all the necessary information&mdash;address family, destination port and IP address of
the server. Each <tt  >socket</tt> structure has a member
that is a pointer to a structure of type <tt  >struct
proto_ops</tt>. This structure contains a list of
function pointers to all the operations that can
be performed on a socket. We use the <tt  >connect()</tt>
function of this structure to establish a connection
to the server. Our functions <tt  >read_response()</tt> and
<tt  >send_reply()</tt> transfer data between the client and
server (these functions are explained later):

<pre     class="programlisting">

r = sock_create(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,
                IPPROTO_TCP, &amp;data);
memset(&amp;claddr,0, sizeof(claddr));
claddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
claddr.sin_port = htons(EPH_PORT);
clddr.sin_addr.s_addr= htonl(
                       create_address(srcip));
r = data-&gt;ops-&gt;bind(data,
         (struct sockaddr *)&amp;claddr,
         sizeof (claddr));
r = data-&gt;ops-&gt;listen(data, 1);

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, a data socket is created to transfer data between the client and
server. We fill in another <tt  >struct sockaddr_in</tt>
variable <tt  >claddr</tt> with
information about the client&mdash;protocol family, local unprivileged port
that our client would bind to and, of course, the IP address. Next, the
socket is bound to the ephemeral port EPH_PORT. The function
<tt  >listen()</tt>
lets the kernel know that this socket can accept incoming connections:

<pre     class="programlisting">

a = (char *)&amp;claddr.sin_addr;
p = (char *)&amp;claddr.sin_port;

send_reply(control, reply);
read_response(control, response);

strcpy(reply, "RETR ");
strcat(reply, src);
strcat(reply, "\r\n");

send_reply(control, reply);
read_response(control, response);

</pre>
</p><p>
As explained previously, a PORT command is issued to the FTP server to let it
know the port for data transfer. This command is sent over
the control socket and not over the data socket:

<pre     class="programlisting">

new_sock = sock_alloc();
new_sock-&gt;type = data-&gt;type;
new_sock-&gt;ops = data-&gt;ops;

r = data-&gt;ops-&gt;accept(data, new_sock, 0);
new_sock-&gt;ops-&gt;getname(new_sock,
    (struct sockaddr *)address, &amp;len, 2);

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the client is ready to accept data from the server. We create a new
socket and assign it the same <tt  >type</tt> and
<tt  >ops</tt> as our data socket. The
<tt  >accept()</tt> function pulls the first pending connection in the listen
queue and creates a new socket with the same connection properties as
<tt  >data</tt>. The new socket thus created handles all data transfer between
the client and server. The <tt  >getname()</tt> function gets the address at the
other end of the socket. The last three lines in the above segment of
code are useful only for printing information about the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if((total_written = write_to_file(pmk.dst,
            new_sock, response)) &lt; 0)
    goto err3;

</pre>
</p><p>
The function <tt  >write_to_file</tt> deals with opening a file
in the kernel and writing data from the socket back
into the file. Writing to sockets works like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void send_reply(struct socket *sock, char *str)
{
    send_sync_buf(sock, str, strlen(str),
                  MSG_DONTWAIT);
}


int send_sync_buf
(struct socket *sock, const char *buf,
 const size_t length, unsigned long flags)
{
    struct msghdr msg;
    struct iovec iov;
    int len, written = 0, left = length;
    mm_segment_t oldmm;

    msg.msg_name     = 0;
    msg.msg_namelen  = 0;
    msg.msg_iov      = &amp;iov;
    msg.msg_iovlen   = 1;
    msg.msg_control  = NULL;
    msg.msg_controllen = 0;
    msg.msg_flags    = flags;

    oldmm = get_fs(); set_fs(KERNEL_DS);

repeat_send:
    msg.msg_iov-&gt;iov_len = left;
    msg.msg_iov-&gt;iov_base = (char *) buf +
                                written;

    len = sock_sendmsg(sock, &amp;msg, left);
    ...
    return written ? written : len;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >send_reply()</tt> function calls
<tt  >send_sync_buf()</tt>, which does the real
job of sending the message by calling
<tt  >sock_sendmsg()</tt>. The function
<tt  >sock_sendmsg()</tt> takes a pointer to
<tt  >struct socket</tt>, the message to be sent
and the message length. The message is represented by the struture
<tt  >msghdr</tt>. One of the important members of this
structure is <tt  >iov</tt> (io
vector). The iovector has two members, <tt  >iov_base</tt>
and <tt  >iov_len</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
struct iovec
{
    /* Should point to message buffer */
    void *iov_base;
    /* Message length */
    __kernel_size_t iov_len;
};
</pre>
</p><p>
These members are filled with appropriate values, and
<tt  >sock_sendmsg()</tt> is
called to send the message.
</p><p>
The macro <tt  >set_fs</tt> is used to set the FS register to point to the
kernel data segment. This allows <tt  >sock_sendmsg()</tt> to find the data in the
kernel data segment instead of the user-space data segment. The macro
<tt  >get_fs</tt> saves the old value of FS. After a call to
<tt  >sock_sendmsg()</tt>, the saved value of FS is restored.
</p><p>
Reading from the socket works similarly:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int read_response(struct socket *sock, char *str)
{
        ...
        len = sock_recvmsg(sock, &amp;msg,
                max_size, 0);
        ...
        return len;
}

The <tt  >read_response()</tt> function is similar to
<tt  >send_reply()</tt>. After
filling the <tt  >msghdr</tt> structure appropriately, it uses
<tt  >sock_recvmsg()</tt>
to read data from a socket and returns the number of bytes read.

A User-Space Program</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's take a look at a user-space program that
invokes our system call to transfer a file. We explain
the relevant details for calling a new system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">

...
#define __NR_my_sys_call 223
_syscall1(long long int, my_sys_call,
          struct params *, p);

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct params pm;
  /* fill pm with appropriate values */
  ...
  r =  my_sys_call(&amp;pm);
  ...
}

</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >#define __NR_my_sys_call 223</tt> assigns a number to our system call.
<tt  >_syscall1()</tt> is a macro that creates a stub for the system call. It
shows the type and number of arguments that our system call expects.
With this in place, <tt  >my_sys_call</tt> can be invoked
just like any other
system call. Upon running the program, with correct values for the
source and destination files, a file from a remote FTP server is
downloaded onto the client machine. Here is a transcript of a sample run:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# make
make -C /lib/modules/2.6.9/build SUBDIRS=/home/ppadala/ftp modules
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/ppadala/linux-2.6.9'

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
We have seen a basic implementation of an FTP client within the kernel.
This article explains various issues of socket programming in the
kernel. Interested readers can follow these ideas to write various
network applications, such as an HTTP client or even a Web
server in the kernel. Kernel applications, such as the TUX Web server are
used for high-performance content serving and are well suited for
environments that demand data transfer at high rates. Careful attention
has to be paid to the design, implementation and security issues of such
applications.
