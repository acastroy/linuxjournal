Ruby, an interpreted programming language that looks and feels like a
cross between Smalltalk and Perl, has been around for about ten years.
Ruby has been gaining in popularity over the last few years, partly
because of the release of English-language books and documentation. In
addition, programmers have become more interested in finding an
alternative to Perl and Python for their general-purpose programming
needs.
</p><p>
Ruby's popularity might have continued to grow slowly were it not for
Ruby on Rails, a Web development framework that has become the focus
of enormous attention. Everyone in the Web development world seems to
be talking about Rails; magazine articles, blog postings, conference
tracks and even some new books all are dedicated to Rails. Rails is
supposed to be elegant, easy to use and easy to modify. Even developers
with no previous Ruby experience are switching to Rails.
</p><p>
Does Rails live up to the hype surrounding it? To a large degree, I
believe the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;it has a relatively shallow
learning curve, it connects easily and quickly to
relational databases and it makes the creation of many
small- and medium-sized sites faster and easier than I
would have expected. But, of course, no framework is
perfect, particularly one that was released publicly
only one year ago. It remains to be seen if Rails
can hold up against more established technologies on
several different fronts.
</p><p>
This month, we begin to look at several aspects of Ruby on Rails,
so you can decide for yourself if my assessment is accurate. We
begin by installing and configuring a basic Rails application.
Over the next few installments of At the Forge, we will extend our
application in several different ways, considering the ways in which
Rails allows us to create and modify our applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3450"></a>
Installing Rails</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in creating a Rails application is to install Ruby and
then Rails itself. Most modern Linux distributions come with Ruby,
although only the latest released version as of this writing (1.8.2)
works with the most recent version of Rails (0.12.1). New versions of
Rails have been coming out frequently, which means that one or both of
these versions might have changed by the time you read this.
</p><p>
Assuming you have installed Ruby, you next need to
install Gems. It provides access to the Ruby Gems library, which is
something of a cross between SourceForge and Perl's CPAN (see the on-line Resources).
Download and unpack the most recent .tar.gz file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf rubygems-0.8.10.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter the directory as the root user and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby setup.rb all
</pre>
</p><p>
This installs the entire Gems package. Among other things, this
installs the gem program in /usr/bin. You then can install Rails,
which is distributed via Gems, with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install --remote rails
</pre>
</p><p>
As with such systems as CPAN and Debian's apt, the gem program is
smart enough to identify and download any dependencies it might
encounter. By default, you need to explicitly answer &ldquo;y&rdquo; when asked
if you are interested in installing any dependencies. Because Rails
depends on a number of other packages, you should be sure to answer
&ldquo;y&rdquo; when prompted.
</p><p>
When you are returned to the shell prompt, you can assume that Rails
has been installed. However, this is not quite enough.
If you are
interested in working with a relational database, you also need
to install a database interface library. Because I work with
PostgreSQL, I installed the pure Ruby client, called postgres-pr:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install --remote postgres-pr
</pre>
</p><p>
Somewhat confusingly, there also is a set of PostgreSQL client
libraries (called postgresql) that can be used with Ruby. However,
it seems as though most Rails developers are working with the postgres-pr
library, at least for now.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3978"></a>
Creating an Application</h2></div></div><p>
Once Rails is installed, we can create a simple &ldquo;Hello,
world&rdquo; program. To do this, we use the
<tt  >rails</tt> command, which is
installed in /usr/bin/ by default. Because our example application is
a Weblog, we call the application blog. For reference, the name
of the application doesn't have to be linked to the name of the URL
under which it will appear. Type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails blog
</pre>
</p><p>
Running this produces a fair amount of output, listing the files that
have been created on our filesystem. When we give only a single name, blog,
the application is created inside of a directory with that name. We can
keep all of our applications inside of a single container directory,
such as ~/Rails, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/Rails
rails ~/Rails/blog
</pre>
</p><p>
If we look inside of the newly created application directory, we
see a number of directories and files. The script directory
contains administrative programs, written in Ruby, of course. The
public directory contains static HTML files, as well as images,
stylesheets, JavaScript code and templates that you may use in your
application.
</p><p>
The directory you are mostly likely to work with is app,
which contains the application itself. The app directory contains
subdirectories named models, views and controllers. This design
reflects the fact that Rails uses the MVC (model/view/controller)
style widely used in many modern desktop and Web applications.
</p><p>
In an MVC architecture, we divide our work into three
parts&mdash;the controller, which acts like a switchboard, invoking the
appropriate model and view; the model, which contains the data and
some of the logic; and the view, which displays information to the
user. If you have ever built a database-backed site with PHP and
Smarty templates or with Zope and its Page Templates or even with Java
and JavaServer Pages (JSPs), you already are familiar with at least
some of these ideas. Rails simply makes them more explicit with its
prenamed directory structure.
</p><p>
Although it can't do much, we now can start our empty Rails application
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/Rails/blog
ruby script/server
</pre>
</p><p>
This starts the WEBrick HTTP server on port 3000. To access this
fairly empty Rails site, we point our browsers to an
appropriate IP address or hostname. In my particular case, I started
Rails on my test server, whose IP address is 192.168.2.3. I thus
point my Web browser to http://192.168.2.3:3000/. And sure enough, there
I see a &ldquo;Welcome on board&rdquo; message, indicating I
have set up Rails correctly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3ea0"></a>
Customizing the Behavior</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we know how to see the default message, let's move toward a
&ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; program. In Rails, there are two basic ways to do
this. We can create a controller that returns HTML to the user's
browser, or we can create a view that does the same. Let's try it
both ways, so that we can better understand the relationship between
controllers and views.
</p><p>
If all we want to do is include a simple, static HTML
document, we can do so in the public directory.
In other words, the file blog/public/foo.html
is available under WEBrick&mdash;started by executing
<tt  >blog/script/server</tt>&mdash;at the URL /foo.html.
</p><p>
Of course, we're interested in doing something
a bit more interesting than serving static HTML
documents. We can do that by creating a controller
class and then defining a method within that class
to produce a basic &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; message.
Admittedly, this is a violation of the MVC separation
that Rails tries to enforce, but as a simple
indication of how things work, it seems like a good
next step.
</p><p>
To generate a new controller class named MyBlog, we enter the blog
directory and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate controller MyBlog
</pre>
</p><p>
Each time we want to create a new component in our Rails application,
we call upon <tt  >script/generate</tt> to create a
skeleton. We then can modify that skeleton to suit our specific needs.
As always, Rails tells us what it is doing as it creates the files and
directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exists  app/controllers/
exists  app/helpers/
create  app/views/my_blog
exists  test/functional/
create  app/controllers/my_blog_controller.rb
create  test/functional/my_blog_controller_test.rb
create  app/helpers/my_blog_helper.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
Also notice how our controller class name, MyBlog, has been turned
into various Ruby filenames, such as app/views/my_blog and
app/helpers/my_blog_helper.rb. Create several more controller
classes, and you should see that all of the names, like FooBar, are
implemented in files with names like foo_bar. This is part of the
Rails convention of keeping names consistent. This consistency makes
it possible for Rails to take care of many items almost magically,
especially&mdash;as we will see next month&mdash;when it comes to databases.
</p><p>
The controller that interests us is my_blog_controller.rb. If you
open it up in an editor, you should see that it consists of two lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MyBlogController &lt; ApplicationController
end

</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, this file defines MyBlogController, a class that
inherits from the ApplicationController class. As it stands, the
definition is empty, which means that we have neither overridden any
methods from the parent class nor written any new methods of
our own. Let's change that, using the built-in render_text method to
produce some output:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MyBlogController &lt; ApplicationController

  def hello_world
render_text "Hello, world"
  end

end

</pre>
</p><p>
After adding this method definition, we can see its results by going
to http://192.168.2.3:3000/MyBlog/hello_world.
</p><p>
Notice how the URL has changed: static items in the public
directory, such as our file foo.html, sit just beneath the root URL,
/. By contrast, our method hello_world is accessed by name, under the
controller class that we generated. Also notice that we did not need
to restart Rails in order to create and test this definition.
As soon
as a method is created or changed, it immediately is noticed and
integrated into the current Rails system.
</p><p>
If we define an index method for our controller class, we can
indicate what should be displayed by default:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MyBlogController &lt; ApplicationController

  def hello_world
render_text "Hello, world"
  end

  def index
render_text "I am the index!"
  end

end

</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, it's not that exciting to be able to product static text.
Therefore, let's modify our index method such that it uses Ruby's
built-in Time object to show the current date and time:

<pre     class="programlisting">

def index
    render_text "The time is now " + Time.now.to_s + "\n"
end

</pre>
</p><p>
And voil&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; As soon as we save this modification to disk, the default URL
(http://192.168.2.3:3000/MyBlog/, on my computer) displays the time
and date at which the request was made, as opposed to a never-changing
&ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; message.
</p><p>
Let's conclude this introduction to Rails by separating the controller
from its view once again. In other words, we want to have the
controller handle the logic and the view handle the HTML output.
Once again, Rails allows us to do this easily by taking advantage of
its naming conventions. For example, let us modify our index method again,
this time removing its entire body:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def index
end
</pre>
</p><p>
This might seem strange at first glance. It tells Rails that the
MyBlog controller class has an index method. But it doesn't
generate any output. If you attempt to retrieve the same URL as
before, Rails produces an error message indicating that it could
not find an appropriate template.
</p><p>
Because the template is a view, we can define it inside of the
blog/app/views directory of our application. And because we are
defining the index view for the MyBlog class, we modify the
index.rhtml file in the my_blog subdirectory of views. Notice
how Rails turns ThisName into this_name when it comes to directories.
Doing so saves users from having to think about capitalization in URLs,
while staying consistent with traditional Ruby class naming
conventions.
</p><p>
.rhtml files are a Ruby version of the same kind of template that
you might have seen before. It acts similarly to ASP and JSP
syntax, with &lt;% %&gt; blocks containing code and &lt;%= %&gt; blocks containing
expressions that should be interpolated into the template. However,
nothing stops us from creating an .rhtml template that actually is
static:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;
    Hello, again!
&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Consider what happens now if you attempt to load MyBlog in your
browser. The controller class MyBlog is handed the request. Because
no method was named explicitly, the index method is invoked. And
because index doesn't produce any output, the my_blog/index.rhtml
template is returned to the user.
</p><p>
Finally, let's take advantage of our template's dynamic properties to
set a value in the controller and pass that along to the template. We
modify our index method to read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def index
  @now = Time.now.to_s
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how we have used an @ character at the beginning of the variable
@now. I found this to be a little confusing at first, as @
normally is used as a prefix for instance variables in Ruby. But it soon
becomes fairly natural and logical after some time.
</p><p>
Finally, we modify our template such that it incorporates the string
value contained in @now:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;
    Hello, world!
&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now &lt;%= @now %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Once again, you can retrieve the page even without restarting Ruby.
You should see the date and time as kept on the server, updated each
time you refresh the page.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Ruby on Rails is, without a doubt, one of the most talked-about Web
technologies to emerge in the past few years. This month, we saw how
straightforward it is to create a new Rails application, to create a
controller and a view and to integrate them using a combination of
naming conventions and relatively standard template syntax. However,
we did not discuss views, particularly those associated with a
relational database. Next month, we will do exactly that, connecting
Rails to the PostgreSQL database. I believe doing so will begin to
show why people are so excited about Rails and why it might be a
good tool for many Web developers to learn.
