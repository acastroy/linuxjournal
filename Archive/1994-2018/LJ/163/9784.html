The elegant way SCTP handles multiple streams makes it ideal for things
like chat clients.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd64298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In two previous articles [in the September and October 2007 issues of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>], I looked at the basics of SCTP, how you can use SCTP 
as a replacement for TCP and how you can use SCTP to process multiple streams 
within a single association. In this final article, I look at how a
single endpoint deals with multiple associations (connections to other
endpoints). First though, I explain how SCTP can give extra
information about what is going on through events.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd644a8"></a>
Events</h2></div></div><p>
The SCTP stack can generate events when &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; things happen. By
default, all event generation is turned off except for data events. In
the last article, I discussed the SCTP call sctp_rcvmsg(). By default,
this just returns the data read. But, I also wanted to find out on which
stream the data came, and for this I had to turn on the data_io_event
so the SCTP stack would fill in the sctp_sndrcvinfo structure, which
has the sinfo_stream field. Events are listed in the sctp_event_subscribe
structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
struct sctp_event_subscribe { 
    uint8_t sctp_data_io_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_association_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_address_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_send_failure_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_peer_error_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_shutdown_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_partial_delivery_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_adaptation_layer_event; 
    uint8_t sctp_authentication_event; 
};
</pre>
</p><p>
An application sets fields to one for events it is interested in
and zero for the others. It then makes a call to setsockopt() with
SCTP_EVENTS. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

memset(&amp;event, 0, sizeof(event)); 
event.sctp_data_io_event = 1; 
event.sctp_association_event = 1; 
setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_SCTP, SCTP_EVENTS, 
           &amp;event, sizeof(event));

</pre>
</p><p>
Events are delivered inline along with &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; data whenever a read
(using sctp_recvmsg or similar) is done. If the application turns
on events, reads will contain a mixture of events and data. The
application then will need to examine each read to see whether it is an event
or data to be processed. This is quite straightforward. If the flags
field in the sctp_recvmsg() call has the MSG_NOTIFICATION bit set,
the read message contains an event; otherwise, it contains data as
before. Pseudo-code for this is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

nread = sctp_rcvmsg(..., msg, ..., &amp;flags); 
if (flags &amp; MSG_NOTIFICATION) 
    handle_event(msg); 
else 
    handle_data(msg, nread);

</pre>
</p><p>
Events can be used to tell the following: if a new association has started or if an
old one has terminated; if a peer has changed state by, say, one of the
interfaces becoming unavailable or a new interface becoming available;
if a send has failed, a remote error has occurred or a remote peer
has shut down; if partial delivery has failed; and if authentication
information is available.
</p><p>
If an event is received in the event buffer, first its type must 
be found, and then the buffer can be cast to a suitable type for that
event. For example, the code to handle a shutdown event is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void handle_event(void *buf) { 
    union sctp_notification *notification; 
    struct sn_header *head; 

    notification = buf; 
    switch(notification-&gt;sn_header.sn_type) { 
    case SCTP_SHUTDOWN_EVENT: { 
        struct sctp_shutdown_event *shut; 
        shut = (struct sctp_shutdown_event *) buf; 
        printf("Shutdown on assoc id %d\n", 
                shut-&gt;sse_assoc_id); 
        break; 
    }
    default: 
        printf("Unhandled event type %d\n", 
               notification-&gt;sn_header.sn_type);
    }
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd64920"></a>
Closing an Association</h2></div></div><p>
A socket can support multiple associations. If you close a socket,
it closes all of the associations! It is sometimes desirable to
close only a single association but not the socket, so that the socket
can continue to be used for the other associations.
</p><p>
SCTP can abort an association or close it gracefully. Graceful shutdown
will ensure that any queued messages are delivered properly before
shutdown, while abort does not do this. Either of these are signaled
by setting the sinfo_flags in the sctp_sndrcvinfo structure to the
appropriate value. A graceful shutdown is signaled by setting the
shutdown flag and writing a message (with no data):

<pre     class="programlisting">

sinfo.sinfo_flags = SCTP_EOF; sctp_send(..., &amp;sinfo, ...);

</pre>
</p><p>
The reader then will be sent an sctp_shutdown_event if it has that event
type enabled. The code to handle such an event was shown above. This can
be done only on one-to-many sockets though. For one-to-one sockets, you
are limited to using close().
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd64b30"></a>
Getting the Association ID</h2></div></div><p>
Many of the calls that deal with associations take an association ID as
a parameter. Whereas in TCP, a connection effectively is represented by the
pair of source and destination endpoint IP addresses, in SCTP, the source
and destination can both be multihomed, so they will be represented by the set
of source and the set of destination addresses. For one-to-many sockets,
the source addresses may be shared by many associations, so I need the
destination addresses to identify an association properly. For a single
association, these destination addresses all belong to a single endpoint
computer. The SCTP variation on getsockopt()&mdash;that is,
sctp_opt_info()&mdash;is used to find an association from an address. The reason I cannot
simply use getsockopt() is that I need to pass in a socket address, and
the return value includes the association value. This in/out semantics
is not supported by all implementations of getsockopt(). The code is:


<pre     class="programlisting">

sctp_assoc_t get_associd(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t salen) { 
    struct sctp_paddrinfo sp; 
    int sz; 
    
    sz = sizeof(struct sctp_paddrinfo); 
    bzero(&amp;sp, sz); 
    memcpy(&amp;sp.spinfo_address, sa, salen); 
    if (sctp_opt_info(sockfd, 0, SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO, &amp;sp, &amp;sz) == -1) 
        perror("get assoc"); 
    return (sp.spinfo_assoc_id); 
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Network
Programming</em></span> (volume 1, 3rd
ed.) by W. Richard Stevens, et al., gives different code: the specification has 
changed since that book was written, and the above is now the preferred way 
(and Stevens' code doesn't work under Linux anyway).

Multiple Associations</h2></div></div><p>
A server can handle multiple clients in a number of ways: a TCP server
can use a single server socket that listens for clients and deals with
them sequentially, or it could fork off each new client connection as a
separate process or thread, or it could have many sockets and poll or
select between them. A UDP server typically will keep no client state
and will treat each message in its entirety as a separate
entity. SCTP offers another variation, roughly halfway between TCP
and UDP.
</p><p>
An SCTP socket can handle multiple long-lived associations to many
endpoints simultaneously. It supports the
&ldquo;connection-oriented&rdquo; semantics
of TCP by maintaining an association ID for each association. On the
other hand, it is like UDP in that each read usually returns a complete
message from a client. SCTP applications use the TCP model by using the
one-to-one sockets that I have discussed in the previous two articles. And,
it
uses a one-to-many model, which is more like UDP by using a one-to-many
socket. When you create a socket, you specify whether it is one-to-one or
one-to-many. In the first article in this series, I created a one-to-one
socket by the call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP)
</pre>
</p><p>
To create a one-to-many socket, I simply change the second parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, IPPROTO_SCTP)
</pre>
</p><p>
A TCP server handles multiple connections simultaneously by essentially
using concurrent reads. This is done by using multiple processes,
threads, or by poll/select among many sockets. A UDP server typically
uses a single read loop, handling each message as it arrives. An SCTP
one-to-many server looks like a UDP server: it will bind a socket and
listen. Then, instead of blocking on accept(), which would return a new
one-to-one socket, it blocks on sctp_rcvmsg(), which returns a message
from either a new or existing association. Pseudo-code for such a server is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sockfd = socket(...); 
bind(sockfd, ...); 
listen(sockfd, ...); 
while (true) { 
    nread = sctp_rcvmsg(sockfd, ..., buf, ..., &amp;info); 
    assoc_id = sinfo.sinfo_assoc_id; 
    stream = sinfo.sinfo_stream; 
    handle_message(assoc_id, stream, buf, nread); 
}

</pre>
</p><p>
A client also can use the one-to-many socket model. After binding to a
port (probably an ephemeral one), it can use the single socket to connect
to many other endpoints and use this single socket to send messages to
any of them. It even can do away with an explicit connect operation and
just start sending to new endpoints (an implicit connection is done if
no existing association exists).

Peeled-Off Sockets</h2></div></div><p>
One-to-one sockets follow the TCP model; one-to-many sockets follow
the UDP model. Is it possible to have both at once? Yes, it is, to some
extent. For example, you may have a server that you can talk to in two
modes: ordinary user and superuser. Messages from ordinary users may
be handled in UDP style, reading and just responding, while superuser
connections may need to be treated differently. SCTP allows a connection
on a one-to-many socket to be &ldquo;peeled off&rdquo; and become a one-to-one
socket. This one-to-one socket may then be treated in TCP-style, while
all other associations remain on the one-to-many socket.

Lazy Person's Chat</h2></div></div><p>
In this section, I discuss a simple example of how to build a simple chat
server using SCTP. This isn't meant to be a competitor to the many chat
systems around, rather it is to show some of the features of SCTP.
</p><p>
A chat server must listen for messages coming from a probably transient
group of clients. When a message is received from any one client, it
should send the message back out to all of the other clients.
</p><p>
UDP could be a choice here: a server simply can wait in a read loop, waiting
for messages to come in. But, to send them back out, it needs to keep
a list of clients, and this is a bit more difficult. Clients will come and go,
so some sort of &ldquo;liveness&rdquo; test is needed to keep the list up to date.
</p><p>
SCTP is a better choice: it can sit in a read loop too, but it also
keeps a list of associations and, better, keeps that list up to date by
sending heartbeat messages to the peers. The list management is handled
by SCTP.
</p><p>
TCP also could be a choice: each client would start a new client socket
on the server. The server then would need to keep a list of the client
sockets and do a poll/select between them to see if anyone is sending a
message. Again, SCTP is a better choice: in the one-to-many mode, it will
keep only a single socket, and there is no need for a poll/select loop.
</p><p>
When it comes to sending messages back to all the connected clients,
SCTP makes it even easier&mdash;the flag SCTP_SENDALL that can can be set in
the sctp_sndrcvinfo field of sctp_send(). So a server simply needs to
read a message from any client, set the SCTP_SENDALL bit and write it
back out. The SCTP stack then will send it to all live peers! There are only a
few lines of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

nread = sctp_recvmsg(sockfd, buf, SIZE, 
                    (struct sockaddr *) &amp;client_addr, 
                    &amp;len, &amp;sinfo, &amp;flags); 
bzero(&amp;sinfo, sizeof(sinfo)); 
sinfo.sinfo_flags |= SCTP_SENDALL; 
sctp_send(sockfd, buf, nread, &amp;sinfo, 0);

</pre>
</p><p>
The SCTP_SENDALL flag has been introduced only recently into SCTP and is
not in current kernels (up to 2.6.21.1), but it should make it into the
2.6.22 kernels. The full code for client and server is shown in Listings 1
(chat_client.c) and 2 (chat_server.c).

Unordered Messages</h2></div></div><p>
SCTP normally delivers messages within a stream in the order in which
they were written. If you don't need this, you can turn off the
ordering feature. This can make delivery of messages faster, as they
don't have to be reassembled into the correct order.

New Protocols</h2></div></div><p>
I have examined in these three articles how TCP applications can be moved to
SCTP and discussed the new features of SCTP. So, why isn't everyone
using SCTP now? Well, there is the inertia of moving people off the
TCP applications onto the SCTP versions, and that will happen only when
people become fed up with the TCP versions&mdash;and that may never happen.
</p><p>
The place to look for SCTP is in new applications using new protocols
designed to take advantage of SCTP:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SS7 (Signaling System 7, see Wikipedia) is a standard for
control signaling in the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). SS7
signaling is done out of band, meaning that SS7 signaling messages
are transported over a separate data connection. This represents a
significant security improvement over earlier systems that used in-band
signaling. SCTP basically was invented to handle protocols like SS7
over IP. SS7 uses multihoming to increase reliability and streams to
avoid the TCP problem of head-of-line blocking.
</p></li><li><p>
Diameter (RFC 3588, <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3588.txt" target="_self">www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3588.txt</a>)
is an IETF protocol to supply an Authentication, Authorization
and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications, such
as network access or IP mobility. A good introduction is at
<a href="http://www.interlinknetworks.com/whitepapers/Introduction_to_Diameter.pdf" target="_self">www.interlinknetworks.com/whitepapers/Introduction_to_Diameter.pdf</a>.
It replaces an earlier protocol, Radius, that ran over UDP. Diameter uses
TCP or SCTP for the added reliability of these transports. A Diameter
server must support both TCP and SCTP; although at present, clients can choose
either. SCTP is the default, and in the future, clients may be required to
support SCTP. SCTP is preferred, because it can use streams to avoid the
head-of-line blocking problem that exists with TCP.
</p></li><li><p>
DLM (Distributed Lock Manager, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cluster/dlm" target="_self">sources.redhat.com/cluster/dlm</a>)
is a Red Hat project currently in the kernel. This can use either TCP
or SCTP. SCTP has the advantage of multihome support. Although TCP 
presently is the default, SCTP can be used by setting a kernel build
configuration flag.
</p></li><li><p>
MPI (Message Passing Interface, <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org" target="_self">www.mpi-forum.org</a>) is a de facto
standard for communication among the processes modeling a parallel program
on a distributed memory system (according to Wikipedia). It does not specify which
transport protocol should be used, although TCP has been common in the
past. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Humaira Kamal, in his Master's thesis, investigated using SCTP as
a transport protocol and reported favourable results. He singled out the
causes as being the message-based nature of SCTP and the use of streams
within an association. These examples show that SCTP is being used in
a variety of real-world situations to gain benefits over the TCP and
UDP transports.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This series of articles has covered the basics of SCTP. There are
many options that can control, in fine detail, the behaviour of an SCTP
stack. There also is ongoing work in bringing a security model into
SCTP, so that, for example, TLS can be run across SCTP. There also
is work being done on different language bindings to SCTP, such as a Java
language binding. SCTP will not make TCP and UDP disappear overnight,
but I hope these articles have shown that it has features that can make
writing many applications easier and more robust.
</p><p>
Of course, SCTP is not the only attempt to devise new
protocols. For comparisons to other new procotols see
&ldquo;Survey of Transport Protocols other than Standard TCP&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.ogf.org/Public_Comment_Docs/Documents/May-2005/draft-ggf-dtrg-survey-1.pdf" target="_self">www.ogf.org/Public_Comment_Docs/Documents/May-2005/draft-ggf-dtrg-survey-1.pdf</a>. This shows that SCTP stacks up very well against possible
alternatives, so you might want to consider it for your next networking
project!
