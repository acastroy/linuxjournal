The present and future of high-performance computing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b00580.0x1bf8240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Twice a year, a group of scientists in Europe and the United States release
a list of the world's 500 most powerful computing systems.
The Top 500 list is the most prestigious ranking of its kind, with vendors
and users leveraging favorable rankings to promote their work. The most
recent list, released June 2007, reconfirmed a recent trend: Linux is
by far the most frequently used operating system in high-performance
computing (HPC). Consider the numbers: 389 machines (or 78%),
run some flavor of Linux, 64 run UNIX, two run Windows and 42 feature
a mix of Linux and other operating systems.
</p><p>
Although such dominance suggests that Linux has had a long history in HPC,
the truth is that Linux clusters began replacing UNIX systems only
six years ago. The reason for such quick initial take-up is due to
the fact that Linux and open systems brought commodity hardware and
software into what had previously been a proprietary systems market.
This change brought costs down significantly, allowing users at the
high end to purchase more power at lower cost and opening the door for
new users, such as traditional product designers who were not able
to afford closed proprietary systems. The domination of Linux in the
HPC market is so successful that market research firm IDC estimated
Linux represented 65% of the total HPC market by mid-2006 (as
compared to approximately 30% for UNIX), with additional growth
projected. The Top 500 list confirms that growth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b00580.0x1bf8450"></a>
Challenges and Questions</h2></div></div><p>
Linux is clearly the present of HPC, but is it the future? Microsoft
continues to make advancements with its Windows Compute Cluster Server,
has plenty of cash on hand and is clearly capable, from a business
perspective, of eating up market share. In addition, despite its
well-known flaws, everyone has worked with and is familiar with Windows,
potentially making it a comfortable platform to new HPC users.
</p><p>
Complicating matters further is that, despite their well-earned market
dominance, high-performance Linux clusters have, in many cases, earned
a reputation for being difficult to build and manage. Widely available
commodity components lead to complexity in the selection, integration
and testing required when building a stable system. This complexity
becomes doubly problematic when you consider that organizations invest
in HPC systems in order to get the best possible performance for the
applications they run. Small variations in system architecture can
have a disproportionately large impact on time to production, system
throughput and the price/performance ratio.
</p><p>
Furthermore, like any new technology, the first high-performance Linux
clusters hit bumps in the road. Early systems took a very long time
for vendors to build and deliver and an even longer time to put into
production. Additionally, early management software made re-provisioning
systems and upgrading components cumbersome. Finally, delivering HPC
systems is as much about understanding the nuances of computer-aided
engineering (CAE) applications as it is about understanding technical
minutiae related to interconnects, processors and operating systems.
Early vendors of high-performance Linux clusters did not necessarily
have the expertise in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element
analysis (FEA) and visualization codes of proprietary systems vendors.
</p><p>
It is, therefore, natural for many to question whether the tremendous
price advantage of Linux and open systems still outweighs all other
considerations. The truth is that although Windows provides some advantages
to entry-level HPC users, high-performance Linux clusters have matured.
Today's Linux clusters deliver better performance at a more attractive
price than ever before. Clusters are increasingly being demanded as
turnkey systems, allowing faster time to production and fewer management
headaches. In addition, the very nature of open source has contributed to
the strength of high-performance Linux clustering. Linux clusters adapt
more quickly to new technology changes, are easier to modify and optimize and
benefit from a worldwide community of developers interested in tweaking
and optimizing code.

The Advantages of Linux-Based HPC</h2></div></div><p>
The most important factor in HPC is, of course, performance. National
laboratories and universities want ever-more powerful machines to
solve larger problems with greater fidelity. Aerospace and automotive
engineering companies want better performing systems in order to grow
from running component-level jobs (such as analyzing the stress on an
engine block) to conducting more complex, multi-parameter studies.
Product designers in a variety of other fields want to graduate from
running CAE applications on their relatively slow workstations in order
to accelerate the overall design process.
</p><p>
Performance, therefore, cannot be separated from high-performance
computing and in this area, Linux clusters excel. There are two primary
reasons for this: maturity and community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b00580.0x1bf8870"></a>
Maturity</h2></div></div><p>
With years of experience under their belts, vendors and architects of
high-performance Linux clusters are better equipped than ever to design
stable, tuned systems that deliver the desired price performance and
enable customers to get the most out of their application licenses.
</p><p>
First-generation systems may have been difficult to manage, but the newest
generation comes equipped with advanced cluster management software,
greatly simplifying operations. By selecting an experienced vendor, many
of today's clusters are delivered as full-featured systems as opposed
to an unwieldy pile of stitched-together commodity components. As a
result, users benefit from both lower acquisition costs and easy-to-use
high-performance systems.
</p><p>
The maturity of the Linux HPC industry also contributes to a deeper
understanding of the codes users rely on, as well as the hardware that
goes into building a system. Certain vendors have become experts at
tuning systems and optimizing Linux to meet and overcome the challenges
posed by widely used HPC applications. For example, most high-performance
structures codes, such as those from ANSYS or ABAQUS, require high I/O
to sustain higher rendering rates. Conversely, crash/impact codes don't
require much I/O to run optimally; they are designed to run in parallel
in systems where the average CPU count is 16. Linux has evolved to
the point where it is now very easy for vendors to build systems that
accommodate the needs of these codes&mdash;even within the same cluster.
</p><p>
Alliant Techsystems (ATK) is a recent example of how high-performance
Linux clusters have matured. ATK is an advanced weapon and space systems
company with many years of experience working with HPC systems. In 2006,
faced with upgrading its aging proprietary system, the launch system's
group invested, after extensive benchmarking, in a high-performance Linux
cluster&mdash;finding one tuned and optimized for CFD, FEA and visualization
codes. The decision reflected their understanding that Linux
clusters&mdash;and vendors&mdash;had matured.
</p><p>
&ldquo;We had heard several horror stories of organizations that moved to Linux
supercomputers, only to suffer through installation times that stretched
to six or eight months and beyond&rdquo;, said Nathan Christensen, Engineering
Manager at ATK Launch Systems Group. &ldquo;For instance, one of ATK's other
business units experienced eight weeks of waiting and downtime to get
a system into production. The Launch Systems Group wanted to avoid a
similar experience.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;The system arrived application-tuned, validated and ready for production
use&rdquo;, said Christensen. &ldquo;We were able to move quickly into full
production, generating our simulations and conducting our analysis within
two weeks of delivery.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The system also accelerated the company's time to results, thereby
enabling ATK to complete designs faster and conduct more frequent,
higher-fidelity analysis. The launch system's group completes runs
three to four times faster than before. In addition, on some of its
key CFD and FEA applications, ATK has been able to achieve ten times the
throughput performance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b00580.0x1bf8ce8"></a>
Community</h2></div></div><p>
The greater Linux community is also an important factor in assuring that
Linux-based systems deliver the greatest performance. The benefit of
being open source means that users and vendors from around the world
continue to develop innovations and share them with the greater community.
This enables Linux-based HPC systems to adapt more quickly to new hardware
and software technologies. As a result, the ability to take advantage
of new processors, interconnects and applications is much greater than
with proprietary systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b00580.0x1bf8df0"></a>
Additional Benefits</h2></div></div><p>
High-performance Linux clusters offer a range of benefits beyond raw
application performance.
</p><p>
First, Linux is well known for its ability to interoperate with all
types of architectures and networks. Because of the investment in
HPC systems, users want to make certain that their systems are as
future-proof as possible. Linux provides users with an operating system
that is flexible enough to accommodate virtually any future advancement.
This is further amplified, of course, when the larger Linux community,
working together to solve common problems, is again taken into question.
In addition, a variety of tools, such as Samba, allow Linux to share file
services with Windows systems, and vice versa.
</p><p>
Second, Linux clusters evolved without headless operations. As a result,
administrative tools are able to install and manage the system as a whole,
rather than as individual workstations or servers. These tools continue
to get easier to use, enabling users with limited technical skills to
jump quickly into HPC. To take just one example, Linux Networx recently
launched its newest cluster management application, Clusterworx Advanced.
This application provides system administrators with intuitive tools
that greatly simplify operations and reduce administration workload.
</p><p>
Third, Linux-based clusters are easy to scale due, in part, to newer
filesystems, such as GPFS and Lustre, which provide better scalability,
but only on Linux and UNIX. Windows-based filesystems are typically
tuned for file sharing and don't provide the type of performance and
accessibility required when lots of compute nodes all request the same
dataset at the same time.
</p><p>
Fourth, resource management tools, such as Altair's PBS Pro and Platform
LSF, ensure that computing resources are being allocated with utilization
rates exceeding 90%. Without proper resource management, systems
tend to work only when the engineering team works, thereby limiting
overall utilization. With mature resource management tools, such as those
available for Linux-based HPC systems, jobs can be scheduled 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year. Multiple jobs can be run simultaneously, as
needed, thereby ensuring excess power is always put to use.
</p><p>
Fifth, from a stability perspective, Linux&mdash;due to its flexibility
and the number of people working on refining it&mdash;is significantly more
stable and scalable than other platforms. Windows, for instance, is
prone to failure at moderately larger node counts and is not considered
as an option at government and national laboratories.
</p><p>
Sixth, the nature of open source makes Linux the most convenient
platform for vendors and users to work with. Standards are broadly
defined and supported by a worldwide community of programmers&mdash;rather
than the diminishing numbers found at the remaining proprietary vendors.
As a result, there are no shortages of fully developed tools, utilities
and software modifications that users and vendors can leverage in order
to optimize their systems.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The HPC market has made its choice, and the choice is the Linux OS due
to its superior performance, lower costs and its community of open-source
developers and vendors. Windows may have a lot to offer entry-level
users, especially those with more limited resources or goals. Likewise,
UNIX still has a lot to offer for many legacy HPC applications. However,
both Windows and UNIX require more work to be able to deliver the same
functionality and compelling price-performance value of Linux. The HPC
market is more open and competitive than it has ever been, but it is clear
that Linux is still the best choice for today and the foreseeable future.
