RapidMind has a mind to make advances in the use of multicore programming
rapidly available.

Writing applications to support multiple CPU cores is not an easy task,
and in some cases, it is even harder if you want to take a huge existing
application and adapt it for multiple cores. So I figured the real
breakthrough is likely to be years away. It seems as if RapidMind has
a solution for this problem that doesn't require a massive overhaul of
an existing application, and its solution is already available.

We invited RapidMind's President and CEO Ray DePaul and Founder and Chief
Scientist Michael McCool to talk
about RapidMind's approach to exploiting the power of multicore systems.
</p><p>
We deemed it important to look at RapidMind, because it seems as if
we're finally entering the age of parallel processing on the desktop
as chip manufacturers bump up against the practical limits of Moore's
Law. Everything from graphics cards to PlayStation 3 consoles exploit
parallel processing these days. I have an Intel quad-core processor
in my workstation. Although I'm happy with it, I find that the only time
I truly appreciate having this multicore chip is when I run multiple
applications simultaneously or run multiple processes, such as with
the command <tt  >make -j 5</tt>. If anything, single-threaded applications run
slower on this chip than on the single-core CPU I used to run, because
each core in the Intel chip is significantly slower (2GHz vs. 3GHz).
</p><p>
So how does RapidMind bridge the gap between existing software and the
changing computational model?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Could you give us a brief description of RapidMind, and the problem
it is designed to solve?</b></span>
</p><p>
DePaul: RapidMind is a multicore software platform that allows software
organizations to leverage the performance of multicore processors and
accelerators to gain a real competitive advantage in their industry. With
RapidMind, you can develop parallel applications with minimal impact
on your development lifecycle, costs and timelines. And, we allow you
to accomplish this without the need for multithreading. You leverage
existing skills, existing compilers and IDEs and take advantage of all
key multicore architectures without constantly porting your application.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: So is it accurate to say RapidMind is actually a library of common
C/C++ operations, where the exploitation of multiple cores is largely
transparent to the programmer?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: RapidMind is much more than a simple library of &ldquo;canned
functions&rdquo;. In fact, it is possible to use the API to the RapidMind
platform to specify an arbitrary computation, and for that computation to
execute in parallel with a very high level of performance. We provide a
sophisticated multicore software platform that can leverage many levels
of parallelization, but at the same time allows developers to express
their own computations in a very familiar, single-threaded way.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How much, if anything, does the programmer need to know about parallel
processing programming techniques in order to use RapidMind?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: We believe that developers are the application experts and
should have some involvement in moving their applications into the parallel
world. The key is to let developers leverage what they already know,
rather than force them down an unfamiliar and frustrating path. RapidMind
is built upon concepts already familiar to all developers: arrays and
functions. It is not necessary for a developer to work directly with
threads, vectorization, cores or synchronization. Fundamentally, a
developer can apply functions to arrays, and this automatically invokes
parallel execution. A RapidMind-enabled program is a single-threaded
sequence of parallel operations and is much easier to understand, code
and test than the multithreaded model of parallel programming.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you give us a simple code example (the includes and declaration
statements that would start a typical program)?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: First, you include the platform header file and optionally
activate the RapidMind namespace:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;rapidmind/platform.hpp&gt; using namespace rapidmind;

</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you can declare variables using RapidMind types for numbers
and arrays:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Value1f f; Array&lt;2,Value3f&gt; a, b;

</pre>
</p><p>
The Value1f type is basically equivalent to a float, and the Array types
are used to manage large collections of data. These can be declared
anywhere you would normally declare C++ variables: as members of classes
or as local or global variables.
</p><p>
A Program object is the RapidMind representation of a function and
is created by enclosing a sequence of operations on RapidMind types
between RM_BEGIN and RM_END. The operations will then be stored in
the Program object. For example, suppose we want to add a value f,
represented using a global variable, to every element of an array.
We would create a program object prog as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Program prog = RM_BEGIN {
  In&lt;Value1f&gt; c; Out&lt;Value1f&gt; d;
   d = c + f;
} RM_END;

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that although the program may run on a co-processor, we can just
refer to external values like f in the same way we would from a function
definition. It is not necessary to write any other code to set up the
communication between the host processor and any co-processors.
</p><p>
To apply this operation to array a and put the result in array b, invoking
a parallel computation, we just use the program object like a function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
b = prog(a);
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, in real applications, program objects can contain a large
number of operations, and a sequence of program objects and collective
operations on arrays (such as scatter, gather and reduce) would be used.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How do you avoid the common pitfalls of parallel processing, such
as deadlocks or other synchronization issues?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool:The semantics of the RapidMind interface does not involve explicit
locking or synchronization by the developer. The platform itself
automatically takes care of these issues when necessary at a lower
level in the runtime platform. The developer cannot specify programs
that deadlock or that have race conditions, in the same way that a Java
developer cannot specify programs that have memory leaks.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: I see Hewlett-Packard software ran 32.2 times faster after the
software was adapted to use RapidMind. How long did it take to modify
the software to use RapidMind?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: Our collaboration with HP was a great test of our
platform. Roughly the same amount of time was taken to RapidMind-enable
the application as was taken by HP to tune its single-core baseline
version. The tuning by HP sped up its version by a factor of 4, whereas
RapidMind running on an NVIDIA 7900 GPU outperformed that by a factor of
more than 32. More recently, we have run the same code on an NVIDIA 8800 GPU
and sped it up by an additional factor of 5, and we also have run the RapidMind
version on our multicore CPU quad-core product and achieved a speedup
of 8 over HP's version.
</p><p>
So the benefit to the software organization is quite startling. For the
same effort, you can use RapidMind not only to get significantly higher
performance on the same multicore processors you're already targeting,
but you can leverage the additional performance of accelerators as
well.
The RapidMind version also will scale automatically to future processors
with more cores.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Is the speed increase in the HP software typical or &ldquo;best
case&rdquo;? What software is most likely to see speed increases? Database
server software? Complex queries on data warehousing? Spam filtering? Web
browsers? Something else?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: We have seen large speedups on a wide range of applications,
including database operations, image and video processing, financial
modeling, pattern matching and analysis, many different kinds of
scientific computation&mdash;the list goes on and on. The RapidMind
platform supports a general-purpose programming model and can be applied
to any kind of computation. The HP test was compute-bound, and it could
take advantage of the high compute performance of GPUs. However,
in memory-bound applications, we have also seen a significant benefit,
over an order of magnitude, from running the application on RapidMind.
RapidMind not only manages parallel execution, it also manages data
flow and so can also directly address the memory bottleneck. As a
software platform company, we are constantly surprised by the variety of
applications that developers are RapidMind-enabling. Prior to the launch
of our v2.0 product in May 2007, we had more than 1,000 developers from many
different industries in our Beta program. The problem is industry-wide,
and we have developed a platform that has very broad applicability.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Shouldn't this kind of adaptation to multiple cores take place in
something more fundamental like the GNU C Library? Is it only a matter
of time before such libraries catch up?
</b></span>
</p><p>
McCool: Simply parallelizing the standard library functions would
not have the same benefit, because they do not, individually, do enough
work. RapidMind programs, in contrast, can do an arbitrary amount of
user-specified parallel computation.
</p><p>
Although RapidMind looks like a library to the developer, it's important
to realize that most of the work is done by the runtime platform. The
challenge facing multicore developers is not one that can be solved
solely with libraries. Developers need a system that efficiently takes
care of the complexities of multicore: processor-specific optimization,
data management, dynamic load balancing, scaling for additional cores
and multiple levels of parallelization. The RapidMind platform performs
all of these functions.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: You support multiple platforms on different levels. For example,
you can exploit the processors on NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards, the
Cell processor, as well as multicore CPUs. In addition, you support
both Linux and Windows, correct?
</b></span>
</p><p>
DePaul: The processor vendors are delivering some exciting and disruptive
innovations. Software companies are faced with some tough choices&mdash;which vendors and which architectures should they support. By leveraging
RapidMind, they get to benefit from all of the hardware innovations
and deliver better products to their customers within their current
development cycles and timelines. RapidMind will continue to provide
portable performance across a range of both processors and operating
systems. We will support future multicore and many-core processors,
so applications written with RapidMind today are future-proofed and can
automatically take advantage of new architectures that will likely arise,
such as increases in the number of cores.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you tell us more about your recently demonstrated support for
Intel and AMD multicore CPUs?
</b></span>
</p><p>
DePaul: It's difficult to overstate the value we bring to software
companies targeting Intel and AMD multicore CPUs. For example, at
SIGGRAPH in San Diego, we demonstrated a 10x performance improvement on an
application running on eight CPU cores. RapidMind-enabled applications will
scale to any number of cores, even across multiple processors, and will
be tuned for both Intel and AMD architectures. Software organizations
can now target multicore CPUs, as well as accelerators, such as ATI and
NVIDIA GPUs and the Cell processor, all with the same source code.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Is there anything else you'd like to tell our readers?
</b></span>
</p><p>
DePaul: It's becoming clear that software organizations' plans for
multicore processors and accelerators will be one of the most important
initiatives they take this year. Companies that choose to do nothing
will quickly find themselves behind the performance curve. Companies
that embark on large complex multithreading projects will be frustrated
with the costs and timelines, and in the end, largely disappointed with
the outcome. We are fortunate to be partnering with a group of software
organizations that see an opportunity to deliver substantial performance
improvements to their customers without a devastating impact on their
software development cycles.
