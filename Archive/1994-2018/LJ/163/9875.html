&ldquo;Dead reckoning&rdquo;, cried Davi. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
</p><p>
I had been adjusting the compass of my sailboat, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span>, measuring
for possible magnetic influences that would affect the readings, and I
had mentioned the dead reckoning method of navigation to Davi. Now, I
knew I was going to pay the price of explanation.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Dead reckoning is the method of determining where you are by knowing
where you have been, adding to that the direction and speed you have been
traveling, and the length of time you have
been going in that direction to determine a new position. It was used
for many hundreds of years at sea&rdquo;, I told him.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Wow, that must have been hard&rdquo;, said my young friend.
&ldquo;And it must have generated
many errors.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I answered, &ldquo;and the method was blamed for the loss of hundreds
of ships and thousands of lives, including the wreck of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>HMS
Association</em></span> and several other ships from the British fleet off the Isles
of Scilly on October 22, 1707&mdash;1,400 British sailors
died.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I continued, 
&ldquo;This accident led John Harrison, a carpenter, to develop the marine
chronometer, a clock accurate enough to calculate longitude 
easily while at sea. Harrison's life is a fascinating story of
perseverance and hard work, which led to many important inventions, 
including bi-metal strips and the roller bearing. Unfortunately,
England's Board of Longitude kept rejecting the work done by Harrison,
citing inaccuracies in the running of the clocks, and it was felt that
part of this rejection was because Harrison was a humble carpenter and
not a gentleman. Eventually, the king had to intervene to see that
justice
was done.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Aboard the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Agape</em></span>, e-mail is my prime method of
communication, and lately,
I have been receiving messages from Sun Microsystems, telling me I
should be switching from Linux to Solaris. They cite many
&ldquo;reasons&rdquo; for
doing this, and although some are features of Solaris that have not yet been
incorporated into Linux, most of them reek of marketing hype.
</p><p>
The first message I received (May 25, 2007) told me that &ldquo;Solaris
offers one thing Linux does&mdash;and 600 things it does not. The
Solaris OS is free and open source&mdash;same as Linux.&rdquo; Yet, nowhere in
the rest of the message does Sun identify those 600 things that Solaris
offers. Nor could I find them listed on Sun's Web site where the links
guided me. Although the message does identify several features that Solaris
has &ldquo;built in&rdquo;, some of those features are offered by major Linux
distributions, and others can be added by &ldquo;rolling your own&rdquo; in the Linux
space.
</p><p>
Two of the major features Sun offers are &ldquo;low-cost licensing and
support options&rdquo; and &ldquo;a disruption-free migration path from the
difficulties of a Linux platform to the ease and value of a Solaris 10
solution&rdquo;. Hmm, sounds a bit like marketing hype to me.
</p><p>
Then, on June 27, 2007, I received another letter from Sun:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A lot of myths have been circulating about Linux&mdash;that it's low 
cost; that it runs more apps; that it's pervasive...but when you 
look at the facts you see a different story. 
</p><p>
Red Hat 5.0 does not save you money, runs fewer certified 
applications, and makes migration more difficult. These 
are just three of the many compelling facts that should make you 
wonder, &ldquo;why are you running Linux when you could be running 
Solaris 10 OS?&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Now, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) studies abound showing how Microsoft
is cheaper than Sun, Sun is cheaper than Linux, Linux is cheaper than
Microsoft, and so on. Normally, these TCO studies show
whatever the sponsoring company wants them to show, and it does not take
heaps of intelligence to realize that a TCO study that does not
show the desired &ldquo;winner&rdquo; would not see the light of
day. Although
TCO is important (because if you cannot afford the solution, you cannot implement it), the really interesting indicator is Return on
Investment (ROI) and long-term benefits, which I call Value of
Investment (VOI). VOI is usually what a company wants
for the long run.
</p><p>
Regarding the claim that Red Hat 5.0 &ldquo;does not save you money&rdquo;, Sun
offered one example of a solution offered to Marc Andreessen. Sun's
solution was cheaper than &ldquo;Linux on Intel commodity
hardware&rdquo;. Okay,
fine. But, this particular customer also was Marc Andreessen, and having
worked
in the UNIX Group at Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) for 16 years, I can
imagine the
discussion between the various management groups inside Sun
to make sure it won this account and to make sure it was &ldquo;a good
deal&rdquo;, of which there is no detailed analysis of the terms listed in the
e-mail or on the site. There is nothing wrong, illegal or even
immoral about this deal and its subsequent use in marketing (and
certainly not on Marc's part); it's just a bit opportunistic by Sun to
use a well-known name on a single deal to make its point&mdash;not
scientific, by any means.
</p><p>
As for the claim that Solaris supports more &ldquo;certified
applications&rdquo; than
Red Hat v5.0, Sun used the application base of its SPARC and its x86
architectures <span   class="emphasis"><em>combined</em></span>. How many people want to run both a SPARC and an
Intel box just to get the complete suite of applications? Additionally,
the Solaris OS version had been out for a while, giving independent
software
vendors (ISVs) a chance to certify their applications. Red Hat's v5.0
had been
out for only a month or so at the time of the &ldquo;data
effectiveness&rdquo; 
cited in an e-mail message on April 4, 2007. This is hardly enough time for the
ISVs to certify their software on top of Red Hat's newest release and
and get it into Red Hat's system. Again, there's nothing wrong or
illegal, it's just a little sleazy as a marketing ploy&mdash;okay, more than a
little sleazy.
</p><p>
Sun's claim that Red Hat &ldquo;makes migration more difficult&rdquo;, brings about
the question &ldquo;migration from what?&rdquo; Last night, I went to my
Linux user group meeting, and the speaker, who was running a mixed Solaris
and Linux shop, lamented how hard it was to work on a Solaris system
because of the antiquated and nonstandard set of utilities on the upper
levels of the operating system. His presentation confirmed some of
the issues I knew about and showed that being a Sun customer was not all
peaches and cream. But then again, I do not expect Sun's marketing
group to haul out the spoiled milk.
</p><p>
Sun also claims binary compatibility between releases, but when you
actually read Sun's terms and conditions on binary compatibility, it
basically says Sun guarantees your program to run as long as you did not
use any
interfaces that did not change or were not deleted. This is a
guarantee? It sounds like most of the warranties in the EULAs of most
software products I have seen&mdash;basically worthless.
</p><p>
I received a final e-mail message on June 28, 2007, inviting me to tell Sun why I
used Linux, and offering me a free 4GB iPod Nano if I came in for a
one-hour meeting to listen to why I should use Solaris. I would get the
iPod
if I signed up <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> if I was qualified
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> if the number of iPods (25) had
not been depleted. Hmm, not that I even want an iPod, but what was the
chance of getting that
iPod? That's not illegal or immoral or even sleazy&mdash;just marketing.
</p><p>
Why am I making a big deal about what obviously is a badly positioned
marketing campaign? After all, I was in the marketing group for 
DEC the last eight years of my employment there. I know what it's like in
a large company with many product groups and many marketing strategies
that often run in conflict with each other. I imagine some
people inside Sun really believe in FOSS and the community, and
gnash their teeth whenever they hear of such things. I even know one.
</p><p>
First, Sun purports to be a friend of the Free and Open Source
community and a reseller of Linux and Linux hardware. It has had
four of its server systems certified by at least one Linux
distribution, and it is listed as a Gold Partner of that Linux
distribution. I assume that it is making money doing this and
perhaps even is selling services for those servers and the Linux systems on
them.
</p><p>
But, then I hear reports (and receive e-mail messages) that show this is simply
a bait-and-switch program&mdash;to get Linux customers onto its
customer list and convince them to switch to Solaris. With partners
like this, you really don't need competitors.
</p><p>
Second, Sun has had a long and troubled history with maintaining the
consistency it brags about&mdash;corporate decisions that went in the
face of what its customer base really wanted, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>very painful</em></span> migration of BSD SunOS to System
5.0-based Solaris, and
the needless renaming (and subsequent system administration issues) of
the BSD-based SunOS code base to Solaris 1.x (even though it was the
same code base).
</p></li><li><p>
Supporting and then decommitting from Solaris Intel, not once, but
twice.
</p></li><li><p>
Ignoring the fact that SPARC is big-endian and Intel is little-endian,
so that binary data often is incompatible. (&ldquo;NFS takes care of
that&rdquo;, says
Sun at a tradeshow. &ldquo;No, it does not&rdquo;, says maddog back to them at the
same show.) Endianism was a point that Sun kept pushing as long as
Big-Endian machines were prominent in the marketplace, but it has ignored
this ever
since Intel/AMD reached dominance and SPARCs were the poor kids on the
block.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Third, Sun needs to decide what it wants to be when it grows up. It
continues to spend millions of dollars to duplicate a base operating
system, when it could be addressing customers' needs by better
supporting the Linux community and recognizing that the real enemy is a
certain closed-source, proprietary operating system from a company that
does not allow real competition. Sun needs to redefine its strategy
and become a solutions company (like IBM and HP are doing), while
not abandoning its line of VARs and resellers that made Sun great. Sun
needs to learn how to compete on the really equal playing field that
computer products are now proceeding toward. It can do that, but only
if it is smarter about it.
</p><p>
Fourth, Sun needs to clean up its marketing messages. It claims to have
been &ldquo;founded as an open-source company&rdquo;. In reality, Sun was one of
the companies that took UNIX into a binary distribution model. Although
it is true that this model was somewhat forced by AT&amp;T's arcane
licensing strategies of the time, it was this movement of UNIX companies
to restrict the source code distribution that helped motivate Richard
Stallman to produce the GNU suite and the University of California
Berkeley to complete the first freely distributable Berkeley Software
Distribution.
</p><p>
I do not want to imply that Sun has never helped the Open Source
community or contributed to its well being. Certainly, through time
there have been stellar examples of individuals at Sun that have
contributed more than their share to the community overall. But, let's
put it into the perspective of a company that has had its share of
proprietary, closed-source products and standards wars.
</p><p>
Sun does have some good products. Its work in multicore chips and
multicore development tools (illustrated in an article this month by
Roman Shaposhnik, a Sun employee, on page 80) is a good example of Sun leveraging
off its technologies. Sun also has been doing some good work in
environmentally sound server systems and solutions.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there is a big difference between having good people
working for you who believe in free and open-source software and what
the corporate, management and marketing culture states is the direction
of the company.
</p><p>
Here is my beef: I am a Linux Guy. I believe in free and open-source
software, and this means more than just the open-source licenses that
Sun offers. It means that customers easily can contribute back to the
path that Sun as a company takes, and it means that customers easily
can contribute back to the code that Sun writes. It means that as a
business partner, I can feel free to propose my solutions to my customers
without having my partner run roughshod over me. I have found my
solution to free and open-source software in the Linux kernel and the
people and companies building and contributing to it.
</p><p>
That said, when I engage customers, I engage them with the
concept of solving their problems, and I am not above using a less-open
solution than what I might otherwise find if I think it is worthwhile
for the customer's VOI. I view this as a tactical solution, although the
strategic (and long-term) solution may still be FOSS. This even
might lead to me advocating a Solaris solution for my customer. But this is
what I, as the solution provider, work out with <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> customer.
</p><p>
On the opposite side, being a Linux Guy also means that when I engage
Sun as a supplier of Linux servers for my customers, I want to feel safe
that I can turn my back for a moment and not have the Sun people who
service or resell those servers approach my customers and tell them that
my solution is bad, particularly when that story is based on half-baked
marketing messages with no staying power.
</p><p>
When I was at DEC, I was making fairly
good money in a fairly stable job with good benefits. I saw no issue in
selling both Digital UNIX and Linux on the Alpha. What my customers
asked for, I sold them. When customers asked my opinion, I gave them
the best answer I could for their solution. At that time, Digital UNIX
was a commercially robust and feature-full implementation, and Linux
lacked in a lot of the features that Digital UNIX offered. I did not
tell customers to buy Linux or buy Digital UNIX, because they
both made money for Digital. I could, however, see the writing on the
wall. I knew that over time Linux would have all the features of a
fully robust commercial system, that it would be used as the research arm for
computer science, and that companies pouring $200&ndash;300 million a
year into developing their &ldquo;own version of UNIX&rdquo; would not be able to
compete with an operating system and kernel being developed jointly by
many companies and many minds.
</p><p>
I left that stable job at DEC, because I believed in
the Linux community and the free software model, and because I did not
want to embarrass DEC by actively and aggressively
criticizing its biggest business partner, Microsoft.
</p><p>
Now, Sun runs the risk of alienating what could be its biggest and best
business partner, the Linux community, including Linux VARs and Linux
resellers.
</p><p>
Just as ships no longer use marine chronometers and sextants to &ldquo;follow
the Sun&rdquo;, but use GPS systems instead, companies no longer guide their
businesses with half-baked marketing statements.
</p><p>
Sun's marketing group needs to understand that this is no longer the
time of sailing ships and dead reckoning. You cannot just start from
where you have been and hope to end up where you want by setting some
course and sailing full steam ahead. You will find yourself on the
rocks.
</p><p>
The product era of computer science is sinking, and now the era of
service-oriented computing is well underway. Sun's marketing and
business practices need to move into the 21st century, and Sun
needs a new vision for how it is going to provide solutions for its
customers and partners and move the company forward. I really hope
Sun finds it.
