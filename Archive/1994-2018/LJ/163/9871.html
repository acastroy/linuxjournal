<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #163, November 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has expressed keen interest in finding someone to put
together a full <span   class="bold"><b>git repository</b></span> of the kernel, going all the way back
to version 0.01. He's tried this himself a couple times, and other
folks have made various efforts, but it's a hard problem. Certainly, it
would not be possible to include every patch that went into the
kernel, in the order it was included, because many patches never
were sent to any public forum. Even finding the release announcements for
all the numbered versions will be difficult, and some official
releases are thought to be lost as well. It's a daunting task, but a
very valuable one, even if done incompletely. If someone can do it,
Linus has offered to comment the various early patches and releases,
from memory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mingming Cao</b></span> has submitted patches to
allow the <span   class="bold"><b>ext4 filesystem</b></span> to
perform <span   class="bold"><b>checksum</b></span> calculations on its journal to make sure that any
corruption is identified as quickly as possible. With interest from
various folks, including <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>, it looks like this feature 
quickly will be adopted into the official tree, although ext4 still remains
a fairly experimental filesystem.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LinuxConf Europe 2007</b></span> (LCE) will host a semi-formal discussion of
<span   class="bold"><b>containers within the kernel</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Serge E. Hallyn</b></span> recently announced
plans to arrange for a conference room (including phone lines for
anyone who can't be present but still wants to participate) and a
series of half-hour presentations. Containers provide a way to cluster
processes into specific namespaces that are isolated from the rest of
the system and are related to virtualization projects like <span   class="bold"><b>Xen</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michal Piotrowski</b></span> has announced the
<span   class="bold"><b>&ldquo;Linux Kernel Tester's
Guide&rdquo;</b></span>,
translated by <span   class="bold"><b>Rafael J. Wysocki</b></span>, at
<a href="http://www.stardust.webpages.pl/files/handbook/handbook-en-0.3-rc1.pdf" target="_self">www.stardust.webpages.pl/files/handbook/handbook-en-0.3-rc1.pdf</a>.
It is a long document representing much work, it reads like a book,
and it clearly explains a lot of material that most discussions on
the linux-kernel mailing list tend to assume&mdash;for example, how to do a
binary search with git to identify precisely when a particular bug was
introduced into the tree.
</p><p>
Several projects have changed hands recently. <span   class="bold"><b>Valerie Henson</b></span> has had
to abandon the <span   class="bold"><b>Tulip driver</b></span>, and now it
looks like <span   class="bold"><b>Kyle McMartin</b></span> may
become the official maintainer. <span   class="bold"><b>Wim Van
Sebroeck</b></span> has submitted a patch
to make <span   class="bold"><b>Mike Frysinger</b></span> the official
maintainer of the <span   class="bold"><b>Blackfin
Watchdog driver</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Mike Sharkey</b></span>
of <span   class="bold"><b>Pike Aerospace Research Corporation</b></span>
has volunteered to take over the otherwise unmaintained <span   class="bold"><b>Parallel Port
driver</b></span> on behalf of his company. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Anton Vorontsov</b></span> recently became a
co-maintainer of the <span   class="bold"><b>Power Supply
subsystem</b></span>, along with <span   class="bold"><b>David
Woodhouse</b></span>.
</p><p>
Over time, various features have gone into the kernel to support more
and more modern architectures. But, for some of these features that
have no serious negative impact on older hardware, such as the 386
processor, there's been no real effort to isolate the unneeded
features from that older hardware. Kernels compiled for those systems,
therefore, have tended to have larger and larger binaries and to
require more and more RAM to run. For the most part, no one notices or
cares, because most people don't bother running Linux on the 386
anymore. But, the effect has been there, building gradually.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Campbell</b></span> recently started submitting patches to ensure that
architectures like the 386 would compile only features that 
actually would work on those systems. So, things like the <span   class="bold"><b>Pentium TSC
register</b></span> would not be included in compiled 386 kernel binaries. The
result of his work was a much smaller binary, and his patches 
probably will be adopted into the main kernel tree. This kind of support
for legacy systems might have an impact on projects to bring computing
resources to third-world countries and impoverished neighborhoods or
lower the cost of experimenting with clustered solutions.

<h2 class="title">From ACCESS to Excess</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #163, November 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The first shoe dropped in September 2005, when ACCESS Co. Ltd. of Japan
announced that it would acquire Palm OS developer PalmSource for $324
million. The next shoe dropped in February 2006, when PalmSource
detailed the ACCESS Linux Platform (ALP), as an environment open to
running Palm OS binaries and Java applications, in addition to native
Linux apps. Enough other shoes have dropped since then to give the clear
message that ALP has legs. The latest was at LinuxWorld Expo in August
2007,
when the company showed screenshots of an iPhone-like UI and provided
more details around its plan to make Linux the most supportive
environment for mobile device and application development. Chief among
these is the Hiker Application framework that fills in some of the
formerly missing APIs for mobile applications. Hiker originally
was available through the MPL (Mozilla Public License), but it reportedly will
be dual-licensed with the LGPL (v2) license as well.
</p><p>
Looking beyond the superficial resemblances between what ACCESS showed
and the now-familiar iPhone, it's clear that the mobile application
market will divide between Web-based (iPhone) and native OS-based
(ACCESS, OpenMoko, maemo)&mdash;with the latter embracing legacy apps
developed for other platforms as well. Thus, the pavement gets wider on
the road to truly open mobile devices and markets that grow on them.

<h2 class="title">Bring SMS to the Live Web with a FoxBox</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #163, November 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The forces at Acme Systems and KDev, two veteran embedded Linux system
and software developers based in Italy, have conspired to bring the
world SMS FoxBox. It's a Linux-based box dedicated to sending and
receiving SMS messages that can be managed through a Web interface. It
can handle up to 30 incoming messages at a time on a common SIM card. It
also works as an SMS to TCP/IP gateway, so you can combine SMS messaging
with network and user applications. You can SMS to and from e-mail,
MySQL, Web scripts, desktop widgets, whatever.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9871foxf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Acme's SMS FoxBox
</p></div></div><p>
SMS FoxBox is ideal for use in Live Web conditions. Broadcasters can use
it to interact with their audiences. Emergency services can use it to
flow live reports onto Web sites or broadcasts. Lightweight monitoring,
alarm sending, trouble ticketing and remote device management can be
moved to SMS from other methods. Databases and address books can be kept
current.
</p><p>
The unit comes with a GSM quad-band modem, an SD/MMC card for storing
messages (it comes default with a 512MB card). It runs on the 2.6 Linux
kernel, has a BIS module for failover to up to two backup appliances
and an internal clock with a backup battery and NTP support.
</p><p>
By the way, you might remember Acme as the source not only of the tiny
Acme Fox embedded Linux system board, but for its optional Tux Case as well.
Today, that also can come with an Acme Fox SBC (single-board computer).
With Kdev's FoxServe firmware, it can work as a dynamic Web server
(Apache, PHP, SQLite, SSL/TLS and so on).

<h2 class="title">Frisky N800 Hack</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #163, November 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Keijo L&auml;hetkangas has a fun job at Nokia: taking the company's N800
handheld computer (subject of our September 2007 cover story) and
turning it into the brains, faces and controllers of Robot pets. His
Puppy and a four-wheeled Rover companion were stars in the demo room at
this year's Guadec conference in Birmingham (UK). Puppy is remarkably
flexible and expressive. It walks, sits, smiles, dances, sleeps and
even&mdash;how can we put this politely?&mdash;lifts one leg (meaning that Puppy is
a male, or at least acts like one). 
</p><p>
Several Guadec attendees compared
Puppy with Sony's Aibo, the most notable difference (besides looks)
being the Puppy's openness. It's a pure DIY pet&mdash;make of him what you
like. Also, Aibo had no eyes. Puppy not only has eyes on his display,
but he also can look at the world through the N800's built-in camera, which is
in a barely noticeable black cylinder that pops out the side of the
N800. It got confusing to take pictures of Puppy and Rover while they
took pictures of me, which appeared on other N800s over wireless
connections.
</p><p>
Puppy and Rover's non-N800 hardware is all from the Robotics.com
catalog. The controlling software, all open source, is at

<h2 class="title">Raising the Social Tide</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #163, November 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Brad Fitzpatrick has a long pedigree for a young guy. Besides creating
LiveJournal&mdash;one of the earliest and most popular blogging services
(and an open-source one at that)&mdash;he is the creator of OpenID,
Perlbal, MogileFS, memcached, djabberd and many other fine hacks. Astute
readers may recall &ldquo;Distributed Caching with
Memcached&rdquo;, which Brad
wrote for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in 2004. Today, memcached is one of the world's
most widely used distributed caching methods, while OpenID is a
breakaway leader in the user-centric identity field.
</p><p>
In August 2007, Brad published &ldquo;Thoughts on the Social
Graph&rdquo;
(<a href="http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem" target="_self">bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem</a>), which presents this problem
statement:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
There are an increasing number of new &ldquo;social applications&rdquo; as well
as traditional applications that either require the &ldquo;social
graph&rdquo;
or that could provide better value to users by utilizing information
in the social graph. What I mean by &ldquo;social graph&rdquo; is the global
mapping of everybody and how they're related, as Wikipedia describes it
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph</a>). Unfortunately, there
doesn't exist a single social graph (or even multiple graphs that
interoperate) that's comprehensive and decentralized. Rather, there
exists hundreds of disperse social graphs, most of dubious quality
and many of them walled gardens.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
At the time, Wikipedia's &ldquo;social network&rdquo; entry (same as its
&ldquo;social
graph&rdquo; entry) said, &ldquo;Social network analysis views social relationships
in terms of nodes and ties. Nodes are the individual actors within the
networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors.&rdquo; Elsewhere
in Wikipedia, &ldquo;Graph&rdquo; is explained as a mathematical
concept, &ldquo;a set of
objects called points, nodes, or vertices connected by links called
lines or edges&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, the first idea is to move the center of social networking gravity
outside the silo'd sites, each of which impose inconveniences on
themselves as well as their members. As Brad says, &ldquo;People are getting
sick of registering and re-declaring their friends on every site.&rdquo; The
process is also silly. Not long after Google's Orkut social network site
went up, Rael Dornfest made fun of the friendship-declaring protocol by
walking up to people he knew and saying, &ldquo;You are my friend? Yes or
no?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The second idea is to make society itself a platform. Or, in Brad's
terms, to &ldquo;make the social graph a community asset&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;to build the
guts that allow a thousand new social applications to bloom&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Significantly, most social network sites (all but MySpace, I believe)
run on Linux. Wikipedia too. If Brad's right, we can equip the rising
social network tide that lifts all boats. There should even be plenty of
work converting today's silos into tomorrow's arks.
</p><p>
For more, visit <a href="http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem" target="_self">bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem</a>,
or just look
up &ldquo;social graph&rdquo; on the vast Linux hack called Google. The lucky top
result probably will be Brad's.

...the commercial concerns from the very beginning, even when they were
small, were really very important. The commercial distributions were
what drove a lot of the nice installers, and pushed people to improve
usability....I think commercial users of Linux have been very important
in actually improving the product. I think all the technical people who
have been involved have been hugely important, but I think that the kind
of commercial use that you can get with the GPLv2 is also
important&mdash;you need a balance between pure technology, and the kinds of pressures
you get from users through the market....If you have a purely marketing
(or customer) driven approach, you end up with crap technology in the
end. But I think that something that is purely driven by technical
people will also end up as crap technology in the end, and you really
need a balance here.
