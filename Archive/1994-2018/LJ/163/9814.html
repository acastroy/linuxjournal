You don't need a cluster to get cluster-like performance out of your
compiler.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e4240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the most frustrating aspects of open-source development is all
the time spent waiting for code to compile. Right now, compiling KDE's
basic modules and libraries on a single machine takes me around three hours,
and that's just to get a desktop. Even with a core 2 duo, it's a lot of
time to sit around and wait.
</p><p>
With another pair of core duo machines at my disposal, I'd love to be
able to use all of their processing power combined.
Enter distcc.
</p><p>
distcc is a program that allows one to distribute the load of compiling
across multiple machines over the network. It's essentially a front
end to GCC that works for C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++
code. It doesn't require a large cluster of compile hosts to be
useful&mdash;significant compile time decreases can be seen by merely adding one other
similarly powered machine. It's a very powerful tool in a workplace or
university environment where you have a lot of similar workstations at
your disposal, but one of my favourite uses of distcc is to be able to
do development work on my laptop from the comfort of the caf&eacute; downstairs
and push all the compiles up over wireless to my more powerful desktop PC
upstairs. Not only does it get done more quickly, but also the laptop stays cooler.
</p><p>
It's not necessary to use the same distribution on each system, but it's
strongly recommended that you use the same version of GCC. Unless you have set
up cross-compilers, it's also required that you use the same CPU architecture
and the same operating system. For example, Linux (using ELF binaries) and some BSDs
(using a.out) are not, by default, able to compile for each
other. Code can miscompile in many creative and frustrating ways if the
compilers are mismatched.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e45b0"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The latest version of distcc, at the time of this writing, is 2.18.3. There are packages
for most major distributions, or you can download the tarball and
compile it. It follows the usual automake procedure of <tt  >./configure;
make; make install</tt>; see the README and INSTALL files for details.
</p><p>
distcc needs to be called in place of the compiler. You simply can export
CC=distcc for the compilers you want to replace with it, but on a
development workstation, I prefer something a little more permanent. I
like to create symlinks in ~/bin, and set it to be at the front of my
PATH variable. Then, distcc always is called. This approach used to work
around some bugs in the version of ld that was used in building KDE,
and it is considered to have the widest compatibility (see the distcc man
page for more information):


<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/bin
for i in cc c++ gcc g++; do ln -s  `which distcc` ~/bin/$i; done
</pre>
</p><p>
If ~/bin is not already at the beginning of your path, add it to your
shellrc file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
setenv PATH  ~/bin:$PATH
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e48c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
for bourne- and C-compatible shells, respectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e49d0"></a>
Client Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Each client needs to run the distcc d&aelig;mon and needs to allow connections
from the master host on the distcc port (3632). The d&aelig;mon can be started
manually at boot time by adding it to rc.local or bootmisc.sh (depending
on the distribution) or even from an inetd. If distccd is started as an
unprivileged user account, it will retain ownership by that UID. If it
is started as root, it will attempt to change to the distcc or nobody
user. If you want to start the d&aelig;mon as root (perhaps from an init
script) and change to a user that is not distcc or nobody, the option
-user allows you to select which user the d&aelig;mon should run as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
distccd -user jes -allow 192.168.80.0/24
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I also use the -allow option. This accepts a
hostmask in common CIDR notation and restricts distcc access to
the hosts specified. Here, I restrict access only to servers on
the particular subnet I'm using on my home network&mdash;machines with
addresses in the 192.168.80.1&ndash;192.168.80.254 range. If you are
particularly security-conscious, you could restrict it to a single
address (192.168.80.5) or any range of addresses supported by
this notation. I like to leave it pretty loose, because I often change
which host is the master depending on what I'm compiling and when.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e4b88"></a>
Compiling</h2></div></div><p>
Back on the master system on which you plan to run your compiles, you need to
let distcc know where the rest of your cluster is. There are two ways
of achieving this. You can add the hostnames or IP addresses of
your cluster to the file ~/.distcc/hosts, or you can export the variable
DISTCC_HOSTS delimited by whitespace. These names need to resolve&mdash;either
add the names you want to use to /etc/hosts, or use the IP addresses of
the hosts if you don't have internal DNS:

<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.80.128 192.168.80.129 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
The order of the hosts is extremely important. distcc is unable to
determine which hosts are more powerful or under less load and simply
distributes the compile jobs in order. For jobs that can't be run
in parallel, such as configure tests, this means the first host in the list
will bear the brunt of the compiling. If you have machines of varying
power, it can make a large difference in compile time to put the most
powerful machines first and the least powerful machine last on the list
of hosts.
</p><p>
Depending on the power of the computer running distcc, you may not want
to include localhost in the list of hosts at all. Localhost has to do
all of the preprocessing&mdash;a deliberate design choice that means you don't
need to ensure that you have the same set of libraries and header files on each
machine&mdash;and also all of the linking, which is often hugely
processor-intensive on a large compile. There is also a certain small amount of
processing overhead in managing shipping the files around the network
to the other compilers. As a rule of thumb, the distcc documentation
recommends that for three to four hosts, localhost probably should be placed last
on the list, and for greater than five hosts, it should be excluded altogether.
</p><p>
Now that you have your cluster configured, compiling is very similar to
how you would have done it without distcc. The only real difference is
that when issuing the make command, you need to specify multiple
jobs, so that the other machines in the cluster have some work to do. As
a general guide, the number of jobs should be approximately twice the
number of CPUs available. So, for a setup with three single-core
machines,
you would use <tt  >make -j6</tt>. For three dual-core
machines, you would use <tt  >make -j 12</tt>. If
you have removed localhost from your list of hosts, don't include
its CPU or CPUs in this reckoning.

Figure 1. distccmon-text Monitoring a Compile
</p></div></div><p>
distcc includes two monitoring tools that can be used to watch the
progress of compile jobs. The console-based distccmon-text is particularly
excellent if your master host is being accessed via SSH. As the user the
compile job is running as, execute the command <tt  >distccmon-text
$s</tt>, where
$s is the number of seconds at which you would like it to refresh. For
example, the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
distccmon-text 5
</pre>
</p><p>
updates your monitor every five seconds with compile job information.
</p><p>
The graphical distccmon-gnome is distributed as part of distcc if you
compile from source, but it may be a separate package depending on your
distribution. It provides similar information in a graphical display that
allows you to see at a glance which hosts are being heavily utilised
and whether jobs are being distributed properly. It often takes a
few tries to get the order of hosts at the most optimal&mdash;tools like
distccmon-gnome make it easier to see whether machines are being under-
or over-utilised and require moving in the build order.

Security</h2></div></div><p>
distcc relies on the network being trusted. Anyone who is able to connect
to the machine on the distcc port can run arbitrary commands on that
host as the distcc user. It is vitally important that distccd processes
are not run as root but are run as the distcc or nobody user. It's also
extremely important to think carefully about your -allow statements
and ensure that they are locked down appropriately for your network.
</p><p>
In an environment, such as a home or small workplace network, where you're
security firewalled off from the outside world and people can be made
accountable for not being good neighbours on the network, distcc is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>secure
enough</em></span>. It's extremely unlikely that anyone could or would exploit your
distccd hosts if they're not running the d&aelig;mon as root and your allow
statements limit the connecting machines appropriately.
</p><p>
There is also the issue that those on the network can see your distcc
traffic&mdash;source code and object files on the wire for anyone to reach
out and examine. Again, on a trusted network, this is unlikely to be a
problem, but there are situations in which you would not want this to
happen, or could not allow this to happen, depending on what code you
are compiling and under what terms.
</p><p>
On a more hostile network, such as a large university campus or a workplace
where you know there is a problem with security, these could become
serious issues.
</p><p>
For these situations, distcc can be run over SSH. This ensures both
authentication and signing on each end, and it also ensures that the code is encrypted
in transit. SSH is typically around 25% slower due to SSH encryption
overhead. The configuration is very similar, but it requires the use
of ssh-keys. Either passphraseless keys or an ssh-agent must be used,
as you will be unable to supply a password for distcc to use. For SSH
connections, distccd must be installed on the clients, but it must not
be listening for connections&mdash;the d&aelig;mons will be started over SSH
when needed.
</p><p>
First, create an SSH key using <tt  >ssh-keygen -t dsa</tt>, then add it
to the target user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on your distcc hosts.
It's recommended always to set a passphrase on an SSH key for security.
</p><p>
In this example, I'm using my own user account on all of the hosts
and a simple bash loop to distribute the key quickly:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for i in 192.168.80.120 192.168.80.100; do cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub 
 &#8618;| ssh jes@$i 'cat - &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'; done
</pre>
</p><p>
To let distcc know that it needs to connect to the hosts under SSH,
modify either the ~/.distcc/hosts file or $DISTCC_HOSTS variable.
To instruct distcc to use SSH, simply add an @ to the beginning of the
hostname. If you need to use a different user name on any of the hosts,
you can specify it as user@host:

<pre     class="programlisting">
localhost @192.168.80.100 @192.168.80.120
</pre>
</p><p>
Because I'm using a key with a passphrase, I also need to start my
SSH agent with <tt  >ssh-add</tt> and enter my passphrase. For those unfamiliar
with ssh-agent, it's a tool that ships with OpenSSH that facilitates 
needing to enter the passphrase for your key only once a session, retaining
it in memory.
</p><p>
Now that we've set up SSH keys and told distcc to use a secure
connection, the procedure is the same as before&mdash;simply
<tt  >make -jn</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ec580.0x23e5aa8"></a>
Other Options</h2></div></div><p>
This method of modifying the hostname with the options you want distcc
to honour can be used for more than specifying the connection type.
For example, the option /limit can be used to override the default number
of jobs that will be sent to the distccd servers. The original limit is
four jobs per host except localhost, which is sent only two. This could be
increased for servers with more than two CPUs.
</p><p>
Another option is to use lzo compression for either TCP or SSH
connections. This increases CPU overhead, but it may be worthwhile on
slow networks. Combining these two options would be done with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
localhost 192.168.80.100/6,lzo
</pre>
</p><p>
This option increases the jobs sent to 192.168.80.100 to six, and it enables
use of lzo compression. These options are parsed in a specific order,
so some study of the man page is recommended if you intend to use them. A
full list of options with examples can be found on the distcc man page.
</p><p>
The flexibility of distcc covers far more than explained here. One popular configuration is to use it with ccache, a compiler
cache. distcc also can be used with crossdev to cross-compile for
different architectures in a distributed fashion. Now, your old SPARC
workstation can get in on the act, or your G5 Mac-turned-Linux box can
join the party. These are topics for future articles though; for now,
I'm going to go play with my freshly compiled desktop environment.
