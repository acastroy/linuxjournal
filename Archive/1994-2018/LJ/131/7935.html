When questions about computer security turn into questions
about society in general, Richard Thieme takes on the hard problems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c2d580.0x1d253f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Why do we hack? Of all the things a person can spend time on, why
obsess over the myriad details involved in getting a C program to
compile cleanly, a network application to communicate properly or
a Web application to withstand SQL-injection attacks? Why do these
things matter?
</p><p>
Richard Thieme, hacker sage, journalist, business and government
consultant, humanist and former Episcopalian priest, has some ideas why,
and he provides 336 pages worth of credible responses to this and many other
important questions in his unique book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the
Clickstream</em></span>
(Syngress Publishing, 2004).
</p><p>
This is the sort of book you may not realize you want or need until you
know it exists. That's true of a lot of things, many of them trivial
(shrimp-flavored crackers and brass collar-stays come to mind), but
there's nothing trivial about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the
Clickstream</em></span>. Based on
Thieme's on-line column of the same name, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the
Clickstream</em></span>
is about &ldquo;the impact of computer technology on organizations, society,
and one's own self.&rdquo;
</p><p>
If you think that sounds like a big topic, you're right. This book is
composed of columns spanning the better part of a decade, and Richard
still has a long way to go before exhausting his chosen subject.
</p><p>
Actually, though, that's a little like saying &ldquo;that chap Stephen Hawking
is on a roll; I hope he doesn't get bored.&rdquo; Because the picture Richard
Thieme is trying to paint is that of the human condition itself, which
nowadays happens to be inextricably entwined with technology. Each
new &ldquo;Islands in the Clickstream&rdquo; essay he writes adds clarity here or
expands onto fresh canvas there, but the painting never can be completed,
even if it were possible for one person to paint the whole thing.

Disclosure: Mick Was Already a Fan
</b></p><p>
Because I'm all about full disclosure, and because I think saying so might
make me look cool anyhow, I need to tell you I go
<span   class="emphasis"><em>way</em></span> back with
Richard Thieme. Before I became a network security enforcer, I was a
musician, and when still in music school, I had the privilege of serving as
a paid singer for the Reverend Richard Thieme at St. Paul's Episcopalian
Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Yes, I was a professional choirboy. Think that's
funny, <span   class="emphasis"><em>punk</em></span>?
</p><p>
Anyhow, one of the best parts of that job was hearing Richard's sermons.
Each Sunday, Reverend Thieme would deliver a deep, frequently quirky and
always mind-bending monologue on <span   class="emphasis"><em>what it all means</em></span>. This was
seldom the expected dose of &ldquo;this is what the Bible
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tells</em></span> us life
means.&rdquo; No, even back then, Richard was addressing questions like &ldquo;we're
all connected spiritually, but technology and the media also connect
us, in ever more tangible ways; how does that change the nature of our
spiritual connectedness?&rdquo; That's not a quote&mdash;I wish my memory were
that good&mdash;but it's the type of thing he'd talk about.
</p><p>
Well, imagine my surprise, almost a decade later, when I learned that one
of my fellow presenters at the Root Fest 2 hackers' convention was that
very same Richard Thieme. And, aside from the radical change in venue,
he really hadn't changed that much. He was still working on life's
more subtle yet compelling questions; the miner had merely switched
mountains. I've been a big fan of his columns and speeches ever since,
and I am proud to be acquainted with him personally.
</p></div><p>
Rather than simply being arranged chronologically, the essays in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the Clickstream</em></span> are distributed across the following
chapters:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Introduction: This Is the Way the Internet Works
</p></li><li><p>
Computer-Mediated Living: The Digital Filter
</p></li><li><p>
Doing Business Digitally
</p></li><li><p>
Hacking and the Passion for Knowledge
</p></li><li><p>
Digital Spirituality
</p></li><li><p>
Mostly True Predictions
</p></li><li><p>
The Psychology of Digital Life: Identity and Destiny
</p></li><li><p>
Political Implications
</p></li><li><p>
The Dark Side of the Moon and Beyond
</p></li><li><p>
Technology Gets Personal
</p></li></ol></div><p>
This is as good a way to organize Thieme's essays as any. Following
Richard's suggestion, however, I've been reading them more or less
at random. Although certainly there are common themes and even common
observations between essays, there's no narrative per se demanding
sequential reading, even within a given chapter, let alone between
chapters. A single essay, whether five pages in length or one and
one-half, is a completely self-contained Richard Thieme reading
experience.
</p><p>
In this respect, and I hope Richard doesn't clobber me for saying so,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the Clickstream</em></span> is ideal bathroom reading.
</p><p>
So that's what the book is about and how it's organized. But what does
it contain?
</p><p>
As readers of my Paranoid Penguin column might predict, some of
my favorite bits are in Chapter 4, Hacking and the Passion for
Knowledge. Here's a wonderfully representative snippet from the essay
&ldquo;Knowledge, Obsession, Daring&rdquo; (December 26, 1998):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
At a recent hacker con, I was struck&mdash;again&mdash;by the fact
that hacker culture is the space in which everyone will live in the
next century. Hacking is not about breaking into locked rooms. Hacking
is about mapping, then exploring; or perhaps exploring, then mapping.
Hacking is a mandate from evolving technologies to enter a play space
characterized by limitless vistas. Properly understood, hacking in its
essence is a kind of spiritual quest.
</p><p>
Hacking is not just hard work. It is playfulness
at its very best.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Personally, I find it extremely refreshing to read such a concise and
insightful redux of the hacker ethos. I get a very good feeling knowing
that this sort of insight is being preached not only to the choir, so
to speak, but to audiences that include business people, law enforcement
officers and representatives of the federal government.
Now, more than
ever, the world needs hackers to continue exploring and creating, and
it furthermore needs to know that that's what hackers do.
</p><p>
Thieme's insight goes far beyond understanding hacker culture, however. He
also understands our day jobs, and better still, how they relate to
larger societal issues. Consider this passage from &ldquo;Lest We Forget&rdquo;
(November 23, 2001):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Computer security is a good metaphor for societal security because
computer networks are holographic images of societies, a piece of
the whole that contains the whole in symbolic form. Perimeter defense
of electronic networks, we have learned, only goes so far. It's the
nature of networks to subvert boundaries because networks interpenetrate one another in indeterminate ways. Nodes can belong to any of
several networks the way a subway station can be a stop on any of
several lines. One consequence of this is that insiders cause the
great majority of security incidents, which is also a way of saying
that &ldquo;insiders&rdquo; and &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; are difficult to distinguish in a
networked world. Through the use of keystroke loggers, telephone
recorders, and surveillance cameras, &ldquo;insiders&rdquo; in electronic networks are constantly watched. Now that the United States has been
attacked from the inside with its own infrastructure, there is pressure to do the same on a societal level.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I find it remarkable that Thieme sees not only subtle truths and
non-instinctive fine points (and if you think his point about &ldquo;inside&rdquo;
vs. &ldquo;outside&rdquo; is totally obvious, think about how rare it still
is for people to take internal security very seriously), he finds
common threads between these truths and fine points, and then relates
them to larger truths. It's a little like having a friend who not only
finds your lost car keys, but also accurately describes correlations
between short-term memory loss and work-related stress, and ends up
suggesting ways in which the national rates of heart disease and career
dissatisfaction might both be lowered.
</p><p>
I don't mean to sound facetious (though, I am having a little fun
here). My point is that although Richard Thieme is fascinated by hackers,
network security, espionage, UFO encounters, intellectual property
and many other geeky topics, what he's really trying to figure out is
how all that relates to the larger human truths about who we are,
why we do what we do and how our perceived and constructed realities
relate to &ldquo;real&rdquo; reality.
</p><p>
As I stated earlier, a book about the hacker ethos, reality constructs
and humankind's place in the universe may not be the first thing that
comes to mind when you think of computer books worth purchasing. But
on the other hand, that very well may be because it's never occurred to
you that there was such a book. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the
Clickstream</em></span>
is one, probably the only one, and it may provide some crucial things
you haven't been looking for but should have been.
