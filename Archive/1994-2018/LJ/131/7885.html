This undiscovered gem of an open-source project
brings project status information and important project files
together with one streamlined Web interface. Try it and
see if it fits your work style.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f0298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As a network consultant I frequently work with small
teams on any IT-related project. For any given job,
I have to coordinate with other consultants, clients,
data-line vendors and office staff. I am constantly
in need of a way to update coworkers on various
aspects of a project, and oftentimes this includes
sharing files, notes and comments. My corporate
days have taught me that this can be done with
a combination of the Microsoft Exchange public
foldering system and Microsoft Project.
</p><p>
Although the Microsoft products are able to
give me most of what I want, they have their
limitations. First, Exchange/Project is a proprietary
setup geared exclusively toward Microsoft
Windows users and, more specifically, Microsoft users
within the same organization. Second, Microsoft's
Exchange package is not cost effective for most
small companies. Third, although MS Project and
other Gantt charting applications are the de facto
standard for project management applications, they
tend to take a macro-management approach to jobs
and are a better fit for larger-scale operations
like construction. Finally, I wanted integration
between the file repository and the project status
information, so that a project could be managed by a
group of people with the proper collaboration between
parties and across organizations.
</p><p>
I stumbled upon WebCollab on SourceForge and was pleasantly
surprised. According to its creators, WebCollab is
&ldquo;a collaborative Web-based system for projects and project management;
WebCollab is easy to use and encourages users to work together. The
software is functionally elegant and secure without being cumbersome
for users or graphically intensive.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I found all of the above to be true. The authors of the software designed
with function over form in mind, and the interface is extremely plain and
simple with speed and security as its primary goals.
</p><p>
WebCollab is ideal for projects involving small groups of users who have
a fairly constant stream of communication. More than simply a multiuser
to-do list, each created project carries with it a task list, due dates,
color-coded completion status meters, priority settings, message boards
and a file upload section. When any task has a change in status, there is
an option to notify any involved users or groups by e-mail. Between the
continuous message board banter, the file exchange and status e-mails,
WebCollab creates an interactive environment for project management.
A manager easily could use this as a tool to delegate tasks and keep
tabs on exactly what is going on by having a constant dialog with
employees, all through this software.
</p><p>
WebCollab has quite a few great features, and coupled with its simple
install and nonexistent learning curve, it's a great fit for a small
office environment or for projects involving people from different
organizations. For example, I use this as a tool to keep my clients updated
on the status of my work for them, as well as a tool to communicate with
the other engineers and technicians I may be working with.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f0558"></a>
System Requirements/Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The software consists of an Apache-hosted PHP front end to a database
back end. Once the PHP pages are made available with the Web server,
any computer with connectivity, a Web browser and user credentials can
access WebCollab.
</p><p>
I found the optimal configuration to be a Linux,
Apache, MySQL, PHP box, but any operating system
capable of running Apache, PHP and either MySQL or
Postgres can be used. The database can be hosted on a
separate server if necessary. I am currently using a
Pentium III 500MHz workstation with 256MB of
RAM and a 20GB hard drive without issue, and
I probably am overdoing things for my load of about
15 users. This software is perfect for the old system
you have been meaning to use for something productive
or as a lightweight service on an existing server.
All personal biases aside, I'd recommend using Linux
over Windows, or even Mac OS, because of the ease
and security of Linux remote administration and
its lower cost. To set up WebCollab, you need
the ability to create a database and change a few
permissions within the WebCollab directory. Depending
what your file upload traffic is like, you shouldn't
need more than a few hundred megabytes of space in
your Web directory, because the individual file upload
size is limited to 2MB.
</p><p>
With Apache and MySQL under the hood, I have
had no stability issues, and the quality of the PHP
code seems, in general, very solid. That being said,
this is not a software package I would recommend for
an enterprise-level organization. With a small user
base, WebCollab is unproven under heavy load.
Most corporate firms also put an emphasis
on support when choosing software packages.
With WebCollab's current status as a small open-source
project, there is not a programmer standing by 24/7
to help with any data catastrophes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f0710"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installation is extremely simple and took me less than ten minutes. I used
my distro's vanilla installations of Apache, PHP and MySQL, which
worked perfectly. Linux beginners will find the most difficult part
of the install to be creating a new user in MySQL that has the appropriate
access to the database. Aside from that, this is definitely something
that a person who is just beginning to experiment with Linux can install
without complication.
</p><p>
There are two methods of installation, one using the
command line and the other through a Web-based setup
routine. I chose the latter. For the sake of an
example, I use <a href="http://collab.example.com" target="_self">collab.example.com</a> here.
</p><p>
Download and unzip the tarball into your Web directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tar -zxvf WebCollab-1.62.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
Change the permissions on the main config file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd WebCollab-1.62/config
# chmod 666 config.php
</pre>
</p><p>
Point a Web browser to <a href="http://collab.example.com/WebCollab-1.62/setup.php" target="_self">collab.example.com/WebCollab-1.62/setup.php</a>.
This guides you through the automated
portion of the setup, which includes creating an
SQL database and running a table creation script,
as well as setting four environment variables in the
relevant config.php file.
</p><p>
Restore the permissions on the config file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# chmod 664 config.php
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f0b88"></a>
User/Groups</h2></div></div><p>
A user name and password are required to access any part of the software
and determine which projects can and cannot be viewed and/or edited.
As with most other systems, only administrative users have the ability
to add or remove accounts. A user also can be designated as a project
or task owner, giving that account the ability to perform administrative
tasks on that particular project or task.
</p><p>
Groups also play an important role in task designation. Projects can
be assigned by the owner to a user or to an entire group. Subgroups or
task groups can then be used to further delegate tasks within a given
project.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7885f1.large.jpg"><img src="7885f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Administrators can create new user accounts
from this page. The e-mail address entered here is
used for the e-mail notifications for status updates.
</p></div></div><p>
The access control is fairly comprehensive and provides a lot of
flexibility for administrators and project owners. For example,
I frequently have projects with other engineers, which required the
ability of all parties to edit tasks, mark jobs complete and change
due dates. In these cases, I assign everyone in my group edit rights
to the project. I also have projects that I allow clients to view,
and in these cases, I want to restrict them to read-only. I also do not
want clients to be able to view any project other than their own. Both of
these details easily are achieved by checking or unchecking the All
users can view or Anyone in the user group can edit buttons.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7885f2.large.jpg"><img src="7885f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The creation form for a new project gives
you the opportunity to set up access control and user
notification, simply by checking the appropriate boxes.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f10b0"></a>
Project/Task Creation</h2></div></div><p>
WebCollab is ideal for projects that can be broken
down into a series of tasks with brief, one or two sentence,
descriptions.
Each project and task has a description
field, start date, end date, priority and assigned
group. When a task is created for a given project,
it is treated as a subproject, with the same
information fields and editable data as its parent
job. This portion of the software is similar to
most versions of popular to-do lists, but it adds the
flexibility to be used as a quick checklist or
a fairly in-depth breakdown of a task with running
commentary.
</p><p>
The project and task views are where the
software really shines. As mentioned before, each
has its own file upload section and message board.
This is where the collaborative aspects of WebCollab
really set it apart from a traditional to-do list.
Users can ask each other questions, make comments,
upload relevant documents and much more. This is what
separate WebCollab from task management applications
and makes it more of a project-oriented groupware.
I find the message board element of WebCollab to make
things more interactive and thus more interesting for
everyone involved.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7885f3.large.jpg"><img src="7885f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Task views include links to relevant files.
This VPN task information page makes it easy to find
the necessary configuration file.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f13c8"></a>
Views and Navigation</h2></div></div><p>
The ability to navigate between views is intuitive and
easy. Almost everything is a hyperlink, which, when clicked, takes you
to a more in-depth view of that particular piece of data. For example,
in the main view for a project, each task is represented by its title,
and clicking on that title takes you to the main view for that task, complete
with summary, due dates, related files and more.
</p><p>
Every user or group name displayed within
the context of the project or task descriptions is also a link to more
information about that particular user. Everything initially is represented in
a shorthand view, with more information available when clicked. Although
this may not seem like much, it becomes handy and makes toggling
between various views a breeze. A navigation bar also is present along
the left side of the screen at all times.
</p><p>
As is typical with project management packages, there are a variety of
different views, each of which gives a slightly different perspective. When a
user logs in, he or she is initially at Home Page view. This shows a listing
of projects and tasks that the user is involved in with completion status and
due dates. Two other key views are the To-Do List view and the Calendar
view; both are self-explanatory. Again, interpreting each view is far from
complex, which is not always the case with project software. All views
can be filtered by both user and group and have a print view button,
which displays the current screen in a more paper-friendly format.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7885f4.large.jpg"><img src="7885f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Calendar view is basic, but it provides a
nice visual breakdown of what has to be done when.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f8580.0x13f1738"></a>
Security</h2></div></div><p>
WebCollab is best fitted for a small or home office
environment. Being a noncommercial open-source
project, the only real support available is through the
message board on the Web site. Although that may
be excellent, it usually is something that corporate
higher-ups will frown upon. Given its tiny user base,
I doubt that software like this is a target for
attacks, but Apache and MySQL are. For those who
are not intimately familiar with Apache, PHP and
MySQL, I would advise looking into using some
of the Linux distro-specific security update tools, like Debian's apt-get or SuSE's YaST, to keep these
packages up to date and as secure as possible.
</p><p>The
user management and access-control tools within the
software itself do a good job of limiting what people
can and cannot see, and these controls are granular
enough that they can be customized on a user, group
or subgroup level. All accounts and passwords are
stored in MySQL with the passwords obviously being an
encrypted field. It's probably a good idea to configure
your Web server to serve this with SSL, over port 443, to deter
any potential snoopers.
</p><p>
I also would suggest that anyone putting mission-critical data on
this do a bit of homework on the interaction of PHP and MySQL with
respect to passing database user names and passwords. All in all, I am
fairly satisfied with the developers' efforts to make this software as
secure as possible given its target audience.

Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
WebCollab's beauty is in its simplicity. It's easy to install, use and
maintain. It provides a comprehensive and flexible take on small-scale
project management. Some users may be deterred by its lack of aesthetic
detail, but if you prefer streamlined interfaces and quick-to-render
pages to other bells and whistles, I would definitely suggest giving
WebCollab a try. It's built on proven technology, so it's fast and stable,
and because it's Web-based, it's essentially clientless. Users can be added to
the system, and creating tasks and projects takes minutes. I also recommend
this for transient users looking for a centralized to-do list that they
can access from anywhere, as it's a very useful single-user tool.
</p><p>
As someone new to the Open Source community, I've
found browsing sites like Freshmeat and SourceForge
to be a lot like watching independent films or
listening to indie rock bands. Every once in a while,
you come across an unbridled gem that no one seems to
know about; I've found WebCollab to be one of these.
