LAMP is great, but the first Web
development trick you learned is still one of the
most important.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1373580.0x146b240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This issue is going to give you a bunch of Web
development knowledge. Please use it to help
understand the next site or Web application you
build. Don't just download a bunch of open-source
Web code and mangle it. Clean, valid HTML makes the
difference between a Web application that works like
an application and one that works like a slow-loading
Web site. Make your software do HTML right, and you
can do more with the Web.
</p><p>
When the Web was new, we all learned HTML, and
it was good. Then the browser wars, WYSIWYG HTML
editors and the Internet boom came along. When a
Web designer gets squashed between short deadlines,
pixel-for-pixel &ldquo;make it look like that&rdquo; requirements
and buggy inconsistent browsers, the result is bloated
pages full of invalid HTML that tricks broken browsers
into doing the right thing.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, on the development side, we learned
the bad habit of treating HTML like PostScript&mdash;something we don't write ourselves. We gave the
designers a template directory and faithfully threw
their incomprehensible HTML out to the users.
</p><p>
But now it's time to &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; again and care
about HTML. The Mozilla Project trashed the old
Netscape 4 code and released standards-compliant
versions. Konqueror got good. Even the proprietary
browser vendors got up to speed with Cascading
Style Sheets. All of a sudden, a Web application
that was used to spewing out tons of &lt;td valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo;
bgcolor=&ldquo;#ffffaa&rdquo;&gt; could simply apply a class to the
element and let the stylesheet fill in the details.
Life is good again.
</p><p>
At least, it would be, if we would just clean up our
sites and Web-based applications. One Linux site I
just visited served up a page with a nice stylesheet
imported in the page head, then ruined it with a bunch
of unnecessary spacer images and tag attributes that
override the CSS. Unfortunately, that's typical.
</p><p>
We can't blame the flaky browsers or the pixel-pushing
designers anymore. And, it's not like we don't
know HTML&mdash;we just don't care about it enough.
The cause of awful Linux Web sites these days is
steaming piles of code that we download, install
and don't understand&mdash;then clot up with garbage
tags until the site looks kind of like how we want.
In order to make the Web work, you must understand the
software you deploy. If you can't figure out what
template or script is responsible for an element
you want to change, <tt  >rm -rf</tt> the steaming pile and
start over.
</p><p>
When you're testing a Web application locally, or on
a fast network next door to the server, it looks like
it doesn't matter, and a lean, mean 12kB page seems
as fast as a bloated 32kB monster. When you demo the
new Web app to Management, all you get is &ldquo;great job&rdquo;.
When the application goes live, that changes. Even if
it's &ldquo;internal&rdquo;, other employees will be using it over
a VPN from home or a caf&eacute;. Then it all falls apart.
</p><p>
You don't have to be an HTML guru, though you
could do a lot worse than to read Jeffrey Zeldman's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing with Web Standards</em></span>. But if
you want to be a Webmaster, you have to justify the
&ldquo;master&rdquo; part by keeping site bloat under control.
Save the bytes and enjoy the issue.
