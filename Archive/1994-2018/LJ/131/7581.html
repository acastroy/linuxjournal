Sticking in extra print statements is one way to
debug your Perl code, but a full-featured debugger can give you more information.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcb2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Debugging is an annoying necessity in any language, whether it's debugging
your own code or somebody else's that you've been given to make work on
your system. Anything you can do to make debugging easier is a big win.
Perl includes a command-line debugger that can make your debugging job
considerably easier. This article covers the basics of the debugger
and shows off a few tricks you may find useful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcb3f8"></a>
Avoiding Bugs with Warnings and Strict</h2></div></div><p>
An astounding number of bugs can be caught by Perl automatically by
turning on warnings and strict at the beginning of
your program.
If your program includes the line <tt  >use warnings;</tt> you
can catch dozens of common errors, including
variables used only once, which often are typos;
scalar variables used before they are set; and
redefined subroutines.
</p><p>
These diagnostic messages can be explained further by including the
line <tt  >use diagnostics;</tt>, which prints an explanation for each
warning. Or, you can look up the explanations using <tt  >man
perldiag</tt>.
</p><p>
If your Perl version is older than 5.6, instead of use
warnings; you have to use the -w
option on the
first line of the script, like this: <tt  >#!/usr/bin/perl
-w</tt>.
</p><p>
Finally, you can catch additional common errors with <tt  >use
strict;</tt>, which in effect, forbids a few unsafe programming
shortcuts. The rules that use strict turns on are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Variables must be declared before use, with <tt  >my</tt> or
<tt  >our</tt>, or imported with <tt  >use
vars</tt> or fully qualified
with a package name.
</p></li><li><p>
Bare words must be subroutines, not strings, such as <tt  >$string =
blah;</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
References cannot be symbolic; see sidebar.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As you can see, warnings and
strict tighten up a
few of Perl's features that can be used for good but also can be abused.
These commands make debugging easier, because Perl catches these bugs for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcbbe0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Symbolic References
</b></p><p>
Symbolic references are different from regular hard references, where
a variable refers to another variable. Symbolic references are created
when the programmer uses a string as a reference. For example, this
normally is valid Perl code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$name = "username";
$$name = "da";      # sets $username
</pre>
</p><p>
This code easily can cause a case of the interpreter doing what you said,
not what you meant. It is easy to put a symbolic reference
where a hard reference was intended or to confuse the generated variable
name because it never appears in the code.
A much safer way to accomplish the same thing is to use a hash to
store such variables and to turn on strict variable checking with
use
strict.

What's Wrong with Print Statements?</h2></div></div><p>
You might ask at this point, what's wrong with debugging by scattering
print statements in your code? Nothing is wrong with this debugging
technique, but you have more power with the interactive debugger.
You can examine all aspects of the program and environment, not only
those you thought of when you ran the program, and you can see more
clearly what the program actually does. Hopefully, by the end of this
article you will agree that investing a little effort in learning the
debugger pays off in saved time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcbf50"></a>
Starting the Debugger</h2></div></div><p>
The debugger is run from the command line by passing Perl the -d option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -d filename.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are debugging a CGI program written with CGI.pm, simply call it on
the command line with the arguments you'd like to pass, along with -d:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -d filename.pl param=value param2=value
</pre>
</p><p>
Instead of using the command line, you could use the Perl debugger as
part of certain IDEs, such as GNU Emacs or Activestate Komodo, or from
debugger GUI front ends, such as ddd or ptkdb. For space reasons,
I discuss only the command line in this article, but the principles
hold for a GUI debugger as well.
</p><p>
If you're using the command-line debugger, it is useful to have the
Term::ReadLine module installed, which enables cursoring through
the command history.
</p><p>
Here's an example program we use in this article. Copy the following
to a file called sample.pl:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

my $name = "Pengu";

foreach (1..20) {
  &amp;shout($name);
}

sub shout {
  my $name = shift;
  print "*** $name ***\n";
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcc2c0"></a>
Essential Debugger Commands</h2></div></div><p>
The following seven commands are sufficient for basic debugging:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
s: single-step execute the next line, stepping into subroutines.
</p></li><li><p>
n: single-step execute the next line, stepping over subroutines.
</p></li><li><p>
r: nonstop execute until the return from the current subroutine.
</p></li><li><p>
c &lt;line-number&gt;: nonstop execute until a particular line.
</p></li><li><p>
l &lt;line-number, range or subroutine&gt;: list source code.
</p></li><li><p>
x &lt;expression&gt;: evaluate and pretty-print &lt;expression&gt;.
</p></li><li><p>
q: quit debugger.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To try these out, run the test program with the debugger:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -d sample.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see debugger startup information:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Default die handler restored.
Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07
Editor support available.
Enter h or h h for help or
man perldebug for more help:

main::(sample.pl:6):	my $name = "Pengu";
  DB&lt;1&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x1dcca50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is the state before the program starts running. The next-to-last
line has useful information about the debugging status: you're in the
main package, file sample.pl line 6, and it displays the line that is
about to be run.
</p><p>
The last line is a prompt with the command number (incrementing
as you enter more commands) and angle brackets, where the number of
angle brackets signifies nested commands. You don't need to worry
about those here.
</p><p>
Type <tt  >s</tt> at the prompt and press Enter
to single-step one line into the program:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;1&gt; s
main::(sample.pl:8):	foreach (1..20) {
  DB&lt;1&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
To repeat the command, press Enter; repeat this as long as you like to
be convinced that the program is stepping through its paces. Every time
you pass the print statement, it is echoed to the screen, interspaced
with the debugging materials.
</p><p>
Now, try the command to step over subroutines (<tt  >n</tt>),
and press Enter
a few times. You go through the loop and receive your subroutine results
right away, without stepping through each command in the subroutine.
</p><p>
Next, try the command to return from the current subroutine
(<tt  >r</tt>). But wait&mdash;if you do it now, it will run until the program finishes,
because you're &ldquo;returning&rdquo; from the main program. First, do a couple
repetitions of <tt  >s</tt> to step into the subroutine.
Then,
with an <tt  >r</tt>, you should see something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;1&gt; s
main::(sample.pl:8):	foreach (1..20) {
  DB&lt;1&gt;
main::(sample.pl:9):	  &amp;shout($name);
  DB&lt;1&gt;
main::shout(sample.pl:13):	  my $name = shift;
  DB&lt;1&gt; r
*** Pengu ***
void context return from main::shout
main::(sample.pl:8):	foreach (1..20) {
  DB&lt;1&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the <tt  >void context return from main::shout</tt>
line. If we had asked for a
return value in the main loop, we would see it displayed here. In Perl,
functions and subroutines can return different values based on the context
of the caller (scalar, array or void). A nice feature of the Perl
debugger is the r command, which tells you what context was
requested by the caller. It can find the bug if you ask your subroutine
for a scalar, but you mistakenly have the subroutine return an array.
</p><p>
Next, we have the l command. Try it now:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;1&gt; l
8==&gt;    foreach (1..20) {
9:        &amp;shout($name);
10      }
11
12      sub shout {
13:       my $name = shift;
14:       print "*** $name ***\n";
15      }
  DB&lt;1&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Alone, <tt  >l</tt> lists a page of the source code, starting at the
next line to be executed, with a text arrow pointing to the next line.
You also can list a range by specifying the line numbers, such as
<tt  >l 200-230</tt>.
Additionally, you can list a subroutine by naming it: <tt  >l
shout</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >c</tt> command continues execution until you hit a particular line number,
so you can jump ahead to a particular piece of code that is interesting:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;1&gt; c 14
main::shout(sample.pl:14):  print "*** $name ***\n";
  DB&lt;1&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can execute any Perl expression, including code that changes the
running program, by typing it at the prompt. This can include setting
variables in the program by hand.
</p><p>
The <tt  >x</tt> command evaluates and pretty-prints any expression,
prepending a numbered index on each line of output, dereferencing
anything that can be dereferenced and indenting each new level
of dereferencing. As an example, below we set an array, @sample, and then
display it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;1&gt; @sample = (1..5)

  DB&lt;2&gt; x @sample
0  1
1  2
2  3
3  4
4  5
  DB&lt;3&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that hashes are displayed with keys and values, each one
on a line. You can display hashes properly by preceeding the hash with
a \, which turns the hash into a hash reference, which is properly
dereferenced. This looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;4&gt; %sample = (1 .. 8)

  DB&lt;5&gt; x \%sample
0  HASH(0x83d53bc)
   1 =&gt; 2
   3 =&gt; 4
   5 =&gt; 6
   7 =&gt; 8
  DB&lt;6&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
When you are satisfied with the results, quit the debugging exercise with
<tt  >q</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c58a8"></a>
Four More Debugger Commands</h2></div></div><p>
Many people
use the Perl debugger with no more than these commands. Once you are
comfortable with those, however, an additional four commands can make your debugging
more efficient, especially for programs that use object-oriented code:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/&lt;pattern&gt;: lists source code at next regular expression match.
</p></li><li><p>
?&lt;pattern&gt;: lists source code at previous regular expression match.
</p></li><li><p>
S: lists all subroutines and methods available to the program.
</p></li><li><p>
m &lt;object or package&gt;: lists all methods available on the given object or package.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can search and display code that matches a string or
regular expression with / for forward searches and ?
for backward searches. There should be no space before the string you're
looking for:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;6&gt; /name
6:      my $name = "Pengu";

</pre>
</p><p>
The S and m commands are useful for exploring what subroutines or methods are
available: <tt  >S</tt> lists every subroutine and method available to
the program. These are in reverse order of when they were loaded by
use or require, and they
include routines loaded from the debugger, such as
Term::ReadLine.
The m command lists every method available to an object or by way of a package.
Here is a sample:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  DB&lt;7&gt; use CGI

  DB&lt;8&gt; $q = new CGI

  DB&lt;9&gt; m $q
AUTOLOAD
DESTROY
XHTML_DTD
_compile
_make_tag_func
_reset_globals
_setup_symbols
add_parameter
all_parameters
[...]

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c5e80"></a>
Actions, Breakpoints and Watchpoints</h2></div></div><p>
Actions, breakpoints and watchpoints provide even more control over
the debugger and the running program. You may prefer using them
from a graphical Perl debugging front end, such as ddd, ptkdb
or Activestate Komodo. The most common complaint about the Perl
debugger is remembering the proper command-line shortcut for each command,
and these commands add still more shortcuts to remember.
</p><p>
Additionally, in Perl 5.8 some of the keyboard commands have changed
to make them more internally consistent. Often, though, people need to
use both 5.8 and an earlier version, so it may be easier to use a GUI.
I describe the commands from the command line below; the principles remain
the same.
</p><p>
An action is used to wedge code into your program without modifying the
source file. It can be useful when the code is in production and you want
to test a change. It's also useful if you're in the middle of a debugging run and
want to change code without restarting the debugging session from scratch.
</p><p>
You set an action like so, <tt  >a &lt;line-number&gt;
&lt;code&gt;</tt>.
An example could be:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DB&lt;10&gt; a 9 $index = $_;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c6140"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This adds a new command inside the foreach loop that stores
the index count, which is incremented each time through. If you list
the program, you see an <tt  >a</tt> next to the line number that has
the action. The action is executed before the line to which it is attached.
You can list actions you've set with <tt  >L</tt> and delete an action
by specifying <tt  >a</tt> with the line number without a command.
The previous is for Perl 5.6 and earlier; in Perl 5.8, delete an action
with <tt  >A</tt> and the line number of the action.
</p><p>
Breakpoints and watchpoints return control to the debugger from continuous
execution, such as from <tt  >r</tt> and
<tt  >c</tt> described above.
They are useful for jumping ahead to the particular iteration of a loop
that is having problems, without repeatedly stepping through the loop
by hand.
</p><p>
A breakpoint is set on a line number or subroutine, with an optional
condition that must be met. A breakpoint is set with
<tt  >b</tt> as
shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
b shout
</pre>
</p><p>
If you list the program, you can see a <tt  >b</tt> next to the line number at
the first line of the subroutine shout. Press C to continue execution,
and it stops inside the subroutine.
</p><p>
If you followed the previous example and set the action on line 9,
you could set a breakpoint to stop on a particular iteration of this
loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
b shout ($index eq 8)
</pre>
</p><p>
This should give you an idea of the power of actions and breakpoints,
if you imagine debugging a longer program with complex conditional
statements and external data sources.
</p><p>
You can list breakpoints with <tt  >L</tt> and delete one
with <tt  >d</tt>
in Perl 5.6 and earlier. In Perl 5.8, you delete a breakpoint with
<tt  >B</tt>.
</p><p>
A watchpoint probably is better known as a watch expression. It
halts the program as soon as a specified expression changes. In Perl
5.6, it is set with <tt  >W</tt> as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
W $name
</pre>
</p><p>
You can list watchpoints with <tt  >L</tt> and delete all of them by
specifying no parameter to <tt  >W</tt>. In Perl 5.8, add a watchpoint
with <tt  >w</tt> and delete it with
<tt  >W</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c6b90"></a>
Customizing the Perl Debugger</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing to know is that the debugger is simply a Perl library that
takes advantage of hooks in the Perl interpreter. You could
replace the debugger completely, if you like, by copying the file somewhere and
requiring the file in your code in a BEGIN loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/perl5db.pl ~/myperl5db.pl
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c6cf0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, place this line in your program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN { require "~/myperl5db.pl" }
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cd3580.0x21c6e50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You might do this, for example, if you preferred the syntax and operation
of the 5.6 version debugger over the 5.8 version.
</p><p>
You also can specify an alternative debugger with the
-d
command switch. Perl versions 5.6 onward include DProf, a profiler
that uses debugger hooks. You can use it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -d:DProf mycode.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use the debugger hooks in your own programs. You can set a
breakpoint directly in your code by setting the variable <tt  >$DB::single
= 1;</tt>, which is useful if you need to debug code in a BEGIN
block. Otherwise, they are executed before the debugger gives you a
prompt. Or, you could use the hooks to run particular code whenever
any subroutine is run. To find out more about these and other hooks,
check the perldebug man page.
</p><p>
The debugger has a set of internal variables, also described in the
perldebug man page. To change these variables you can use a configuration
file, .perldb in the current directory or in your home directory.
This configuration file has Perl code that is run when the debugger
starts. For example, you can add new commands of your own, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$DB::alias{'quit'} = 's/^quit(\s*)/q/';

</pre>
</p><p>
This allows you to quit the debugger by typing
<tt  >quit</tt> at the prompt.
The perldebug man page describes a few similar aliases that might be
useful.
</p><p>
A number of debugger options can be set inside the debugger
with the O command. The only one I have used
changes the
pager:

<pre     class="programlisting">
O pager=|less
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, any command that would print more than a screen of output can be
sent through your favorite pager by using a pipe character before the command:
<tt  >|L</tt>.
