The heart of your Linux recording studio is the hard-disk recorder.
Get started with Ardour, which brings pro recording features to open source.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Contemporary musicians employ the computer as a
digital audio workstation (DAW) to perform a wide
variety of tasks dealing with sound. Typical uses
include recording and editing soundfiles, adding
effects and dynamics processing and preparing audio
tracks for a CD master disc.
</p><p>
The centerpiece of the modern musician's
computer-based studio is the hard-disk recorder
(HDR). Musicians working on Apple or Microsoft Windows
machines have an impressive selection of HDR systems
to choose from, but until recently Linux users have
had nothing truly comparable for professional work. A
professional-quality HDR is a profoundly nontrivial
programming endeavor, and proprietary HDR developers
have provided little technical guidance for would-be
designers of an open-source DAW.
</p><p>
Today, thanks to the talent and perseverance of
chief designer/programmer Paul Davis and his
talented crew, Linux musicians now
have a native-born professional-quality HDR/DAW,
named Ardour.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636500"></a>
What It Is, What It Isn't</h2></div></div><p>
Ardour is a multitrack recording and editing system
for high-quality digital audio. Ardour supports audio
processing plugins (LADSPA and VST), parameter control
automation, sophisticated panning control and many
advanced editing procedures. Recognized synchronization
protocols include MIDI time code (MTC), a means of
encoding SMPTE time code to MIDI; MIDI machine
control (MMC), a set of MIDI messages for controlling
transport features of hardware mixers and recorders; and
JACK, a low-latency audio server and application
transport control interface for Linux and Mac OS X.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7796f1.large.jpg"><img src="7796f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ardour is a multitrack recording and editing system
that supports consumer and professional audio hardware.
</p></div></div><p>
Professional audio recording hardware supports datatypes not
commonly encountered in consumer-grade systems. A pro DAW can handle
audio at greater bit depth, for deeper amplitude range and precision;
at high sampling rates, for more accurate frequency resolution; and
with greater flexibility in sound location and spatialization. It is
not uncommon for professional recordists to work with 32-bit soundfiles
recorded with a sampling rate of 96kHz, more than twice the resolution
of compact disc audio.
</p><p>
Ardour is not a MIDI sequence recorder or editor. It knows nothing about
music notation, and it is not designed to be a soundfile editor. Ardour
has only a few built-in signal processing capabilities, and most of its
processing power comes from its supported plugins. Finally, Ardour does
not directly provide facilities for CD mastering and burning, but it is
designed to work well with the excellent JAMin mastering suite.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636870"></a>
Hardware Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
The extent of your use of Ardour is limited fundamentally by the
capabilities of your hardware. If a sound card or audio board is
supported by the ALSA sound system, it should work with Ardour; however,
standard consumer-grade audio devices are not suitable for using
Ardour to its full extent. You can do great things with Ardour and a
SoundBlaster Live, but for professional work, Ardour is happiest
with a multichannel digital audio interface, such as the RME Hammerfall
and M-Audio Delta cards.
</p><p>
Do your homework before purchasing your audio interface. Check the ALSA
site for up-to-date news regarding supported systems, and try to find
others who can comment on the suitability of a particular card. Ardour
can respond to MIDI parameter control, so study the MIDI implementation
charts for any external equipment you plan to use. See if your mixer
specifications support MMC or MTC. Ardour is designed to work with
automated mixer control surfaces, but again, your equipment has to support
the features.
</p><p>
The question of a sufficient base computer
system often pops up on the Ardour users
mailing list. Satisfactory results have been reported
with a 500MHz CPU, but such a system is too limiting
for professional use. A fast CPU ensures accurate
synchronization while recording or playing multiple
audio tracks, and it is absolutely necessary if
you intend to use many effects. For example,
a good reverberation effect can be intensely
CPU-hungry. You also should have a large, fast hard disk,
properly tuned with the hdparm utility for maximum
performance. Multiple tracks of streaming audio data
absolutely require a powerful CPU and a fast
hard disk to ensure perfect synchronization. Also,
32-bit digital audio files can be huge, and a
typical recording session can create nontrivial
storage demands. For professional use, you are
advised to equip your system with two disks&mdash;one for
your system and application software and
one dedicated only to session audio storage. The
Ardour Web site offers suggestions for specific
CPUs, hard-disk specifications and even recommended
motherboards. For best results with Ardour, follow
the designer's advice.
</p><p>
Aaron Trumm's excellent article &ldquo;The Linux-Based
Recording Studio&rdquo; [<i  >Linux Journal</i>, May 2004]
describes room considerations and the setup and
configuration of external equipment needed for
serious recording. Rather than rehashing Aaron's
recommendations, I simply refer readers to that
article for advice on selecting microphones, mixers,
monitor speakers and other outboard gear.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636ad8"></a>
Software Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
The current public version of Ardour is available as source code.
Packages are available for
various Linux distributions, including Red Hat/Fedora, Mandrake, Debian
and Slackware; see the on-line Resources. CVS access
is selective at this time, but a nightly tarball is available from the
Ardour Web site. Compiling Ardour from its source code is uncomplicated,
and complete instructions are included with the tarball.
</p><p>
Check the Ardour Web site for the latest support software required to
build and install the program. Ardour's dependencies include up-to-date
installations of the ALSA kernel sound system, the JACK audio server,
the LADSPA plugin API and collections and various other audio-related
software components. You can configure your existing Linux installation
for optimal performance with the program, but if you're serious about
using Ardour you are advised to install an audio-optimized system
such as AGNULA/Demudi, a Debian-based distribution, or Planet CCRMA, Red Hat/Fedora packages.
Slackware users should install Luke Yelavich's
AudioSlack packages, and Mandrake users can find all necessary packages
at Thac's site.
</p><p>
JAMin is a suite of post-production audio utilities designed for
the preparation of tracks destined for burning to a master CD. This
mastering process uses tools such as compressors, equalizers and
limiters to reduce frequency and amplitude imbalances between tracks. If
you plan to record a full CD with Ardour, you should plan on mastering
it with JAMin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636c90"></a>
Major Features</h2></div></div><p>
Any modern HDR performs three basic functions, corresponding to the
typical work-flow stages of recording, editing and mixing digital
audio. Each stage can be quite complex within itself, but Ardour's user
interface sensibly organizes the program's complexities.
</p><p>
Ardour records to the available hardware limits. If your audio interface
supports 32-channel I/O and there's an ALSA driver for it, you should
be able to work with 32 simultaneous audio channels. Assignment of
channels to tracks is completely flexible, and each track supports mono
or stereo input. Ardour's synchronization capabilities currently work best
with JACK-compliant applications, such as the Hydrogen drum machine and
Rosegarden audio/MIDI sequencer. Much work, however, is going into improving
support for MIDI time code.
</p><p>
As mentioned above, Ardour is not a soundfile editor, but it does include
a variety of edit processes optimized for multitrack recording, such
as typical and not-so-typical cut/copy/paste operations, grouped track
editing and fine control over track and segment relocation. Ardour
offers its own time stretching and amplitude normalization, but the bulk
of its processing power comes from LADSPA plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2636e48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
LADSPA </b></p><p>
The Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin Architecture (LAPSDA)
is an easy-to-implement programming interface for hosting effects and
other plugins in Linux audio applications. The API has been adopted
widely by Linux audio developers to the point that users expect LADSPA in new
sound and music software.
</p><p>
Ardour lets you work with your data as tracks, regions, ranges, chunks
and groups. Data display is variable: you can enlarge or reduce a
track's display, and grouping lets you view only the member tracks in a
specified edit group. Figure 2 shows off Ardour's track display resizing
feature, along with the region editor and the gain automation curve.
</p></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7796f2.large.jpg"><img src="7796f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2637210"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
How Many Tracks?</b></p><p>
As it's used by recordists, the term track properly applies
to a concept derived from the possibilities of recording sound to magnetic
tape. Digital audio is recorded to your hard disk in a different manner,
but the old terminology persists in the graphic representation of multiple
audio streams as linear tracks. The concept of a channel is perhaps best
understood in the context of a mixer. Multichannel mixers provide a number
of inputs (channels) whose signals can be combined and routed freely
before being sent to the mixer outputs. Likewise, a multichannel digital
audio interface provides a number of channels to be combined and routed
to your HDR's tracks. Channel limits are determined by your interface
hardware.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, consumer audio interfaces rarely venture
beyond stereo I/O, while professional hardware can deliver
50 or more channels. Disk space is consumed rapidly by alternate
takes, temporary tracks and backup copies of your session files. Your
software may limit the number of available tracks, but your disk speed
determines the number of available simultaneous tracks. Remember,
high-quality digital audio is a heavy hitter on your system resources.
</p></div><p>
Ardour's mixer panel presents a series of per-track fader strips and a
master control strip. A track strip is divided into sections corresponding
to a &ldquo;from the top downward&rdquo; data path. Input begins at the top
of the strip and passes through controls such as signal polarity and track
solo/mute status. It moves on through pre-fader plugins, the track
fader itself and post-fader plugins before reaching its pan position
and heading out to the output or outputs, typically but not always a master
bus. Other notable features of Ardour's mixer include gain automation, record
and playback fader movement; MIDI control to and from mixers with
MIDI machine control; and plugin parameter control automation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7796f3.large.jpg"><img src="7796f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. In the Mixer panel, think of audio data moving from the top
down through each track strip.
</p></div></div><p>
Thanks to Ardour's use of Erik de Castro Lopo's sndfile library, you
can import and export audio data (track, region and session) to and from
Ardour in any format supported by libsndfile. Currently, that's about 20
different audio file types, including the most popular consumer-grade
and professional formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2637688"></a>
A Session with Ardour</h2></div></div><p>
My goal in the following example session is to demonstrate how Ardour
functions as a multitrack recording system. I've tried to keep technical
terminology to a minimum, but this article does not intend to be a
primer for digital recording. Basic information on the subject can be
found at <a href="http://www.homerecording.com" target="_self">www.homerecording.com</a>, while more advanced topics are covered
at <a href="http://www.prorec.com" target="_self">www.prorec.com</a>. Many other on-line and hard-copy resources can be
found with relevant searches on Google and Amazon.
</p><p>
Session hardware included an M-Audio Delta 66 digital audio interface, a
system that includes a PCI card and a breakout box that together provide
4&times;4 analog I/O and 2&times;2 digital I/O. The digital ports can be configured
for either S/PDIF, a high-quality consumer-grade digital I/O or AES/EBU,
a standard for the recording industry. Each input point is a stereo
port, effectively giving me a possible total of 12 input channels,
with far more flexible routing than is possible with a consumer-grade,
stereo-only sound card.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7796f4.large.jpg"><img src="7796f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Delta 66 I/O Channels Displayed in qjackctl
</p></div></div><p>
I employed two external mixers for the session. A Yamaha DMP11 was used
as a submixer for external synthesizers, and I used a Tascam TM-D1000
for mixing vocal, guitar and harmonica performances before sending
them to the Delta 66. The Tascam mixer provides S/PDIF digital output,
so I routed its feed to the digital ports of the Delta card.
</p><p>
My plan was to use Ardour to record an original song, with multiple
instrumental and vocal tracks, and mix it to recreate the sound of a small
group playing live. However, in this session the small group is only me,
with some imported WAV files and some multitracking in Ardour. I also
planned to use a few LADSPA plugins to add effects to some of the tracks
and to use Ardour's pan controls to position my tracks
across the stereo audio panorama, as players would be positioned on a
stage.
</p><p>
I used a MIDI sequencer to create parts for piano, bass, guitar and
drums. I saved each part as a MIDI file and converted them all to WAV
audio files with the popular TiMidity MIDI utility. The drum track was
converted to a stereo file, the others were converted to monaural files
and all the files were created in 16-bit 44.1kHz WAV format. At that
point they were ready for importing to Ardour.
</p><p>
When you open Ardour for the first time, you see an empty track display
complete with a kindly reminder that you need to create an Ardour session
by using the Session/New dialog. Session templates are available, but I knew
my immediate track needs and created a custom track layout&mdash;one
stereo and
four mono tracks. I imported my WAV files into those tracks, and there
was my backing band.
</p><p>
Next, I recorded three more tracks in Ardour itself, adding a rhythm
guitar part, the vocal track and a harmonica solo. Recording in
Ardour is simple: click on the R button in your selected track to arm
it for recording and then set your inputs and levels in the track's mixer
strip. Next, click on the main display's big red Record button, click on
the transport play control and record at will. You can monitor some
or all other tracks, muting and soloing tracks and groups of tracks in
real time for testing different ensembles.
</p><p>
When I was happy with the recorded performances, I started working on the
mix. Many aspects of the raw mix were in need of attention: the rhythm
guitar track needed a volume fade-out at the end and equalization (EQ) throughout,
the MIDI instruments weren't bright enough in the mix and everything
needed to be normalized and balanced. Fortunately, Ardour handled these tasks
with the greatest of ease. I used LADSPA plugins for equalization and
amplification, and I employed Ardour's own internal normalization routine
when it was needed. I also added reverb to the vocal and harmonica parts,
again by using a LADSPA plugin.
</p><p>
Adding the fade-out to my rhythm guitar track proved to be an interesting
task. First, I clicked on the track's automation button to set the
automation curve display, and then with the mouse on the Gain mode button I could
draw the amplitude curve. Then, I discovered that I could use Ardour's
control automation in the mixer as well. I set the automation state to
write, and then I played the section to be faded out and reduced the fader
level. Ardour recorded my adjustments to the fader, I reset the automation
status to play, and the fader moved downward automatically on playback. By
the way, faders can be ganged together as a mix group for simultaneous
operation, including the recording of simultaneous automation curves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x2637cb8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Normalization and Equalization
</b></p><p>
Normalization is a process that increases the peak
amplitude of a signal to the maximum level before clipping. All other
amplitudes are then raised in their original proportions to the new peak
amplitude. Equalization boosts or cuts the strength of a specified
frequency or range of frequencies. The graphic equalizer found in a
car stereo system is a common example of one kind of EQ device called
a shelving equalizer. It divides the audible spectrum into more or less
narrow bands and provides a control for boosting or weakening the strength
of the frequencies within each band.
</p></div><p>
So how did all this creative activity turn out? You can hear the
results for yourself; see Resources for the URL.
</p><p>
Bear in mind that the recording has not yet been mastered, and I still
can return to my original session and make other changes. Feel free
to suggest improvements, but try to be kind about my modest efforts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x262e7b0"></a>
Synchronization</h2></div></div><p>
Paul Davis also is responsible for creating the JACK low-latency audio
server and transport control interface, so you would expect Ardour's JACK
synchronization capabilities to be well evolved. I tested the Hydrogen drum
machine and the Rosegarden sequencer running in JACK master and slave
modes and experienced mixed levels of success. Both programs were synced to and from Ardour
by way of JACK without trouble. Hydrogen got along nicely with Ardour, but I
had problems recording the output of softsynths driven by Rosegarden. The
Rosegarden team is aware of this issue and intends to resolve it, but you
should check the Rosegarden Web site for the latest news.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7796f5.large.jpg"><img src="7796f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Options Window
</p></div></div><p>
At the time of these tests, Ardour's support for MTC send/receive was under
heavy revision, so I was unable to complete any meaningful tests. However,
MTC support is a major item on many Ardour users' wishlists, and the
remaining bugs should be worked out before version 1.0 is released. Other means of
synchronization may be supported in future versions of Ardour. Direct
SMPTE reading, MIDI clock and SPP (song position pointer) have been
suggested as likely candidates, but work on those protocols will have
to wait until after the Ardour 1.0 release.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x262eac8"></a>
Impressions</h2></div></div><p>
As I learn more about Ardour, there seems to be even more to learn. It's a
credit to Ardour's designers that the initial interface view is clear and
uncluttered, using pull-down and pop-up menus to reveal many underlying
features. Also, many helpful keyboard bindings exist, but you need
to run <tt  >ardour -b</tt> at the command prompt in an xterm to discover them.
</p><p>
After gaining more confidence with Ardour's basic features, I started to explore
more of its capabilities. The TM-D1000 sends MIDI messages and controller
streams for most of its actions, and Ardour's controls can be bound to
external MIDI control surfaces. Ctrl-middle-click on a button or fader
and then activate the controller to set the binding. This feature is very
cool, allowing any hardware device that sends MIDI controller streams
to act as a control surface for Ardour. Incidentally, group definitions
still are in effect, so you can control multiple faders in Ardour from
a single external fader.
</p><p>
The TM-D1000 also transmits and responds to MIDI machine control
(MMC) commands, a valuable feature because Ardour can control and be
controlled from such a device. MMC messages include typical transport
control actions such as start/stop, fast-forward and rewind. Thus,
a MIDI-sensible mixer such as the TM-D1000 can function as a hardware
control surface for almost all of Ardour's operations.
</p><p>
In an article of this length I could test only the features most relevant
to my goals. I have not worked yet with Ardour's looping mechanisms,
MTC still was stabilizing as I completed this article, I didn't check out
the timestretch capability and so on. As I said, Ardour is
a deep application, and there are many useful and interesting features
not touched on in this article's use of the program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x262ed30"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
Development activity around Ardour is intense, especially as the
program closes in on its 1.0 release. Many people are interested
in a viable alternative to the proprietary lock-in solutions available for
other operating systems, and Ardour appears to moving along the right
development path. Much work remains to be done, including improved MIDI
capabilities, video track support, expanded synchronization possibilities
and a GUI overhaul (GTK2 support is planned). However, Ardour currently
is in a feature-freeze, with bug fixes and stability being the first order
of the day before version 1.0 is released.
</p><p>
As might be expected in a pre-1.0 beta release of a large-scale complex
project, it is not quite bug-free. Ardour's Mantis bug-tracking and
feature-request system provides an excellent way to check on the status of known
problems, report new ones and make suggestions for future releases.
</p><p>
VST plugin support currently is problematic, due mainly to continuing
changes in WINE and Linux kernel development, but it is a high-priority
item for the developers. Many users have expressed their willingness
to switch platforms for their audio work if VST/VSTi support becomes
seamless under Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253e580.0x262eee8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
VST/VSTi Plugins</b></p><p>
VST/VSTi audio plugins are a staple item in the
sound software world. The VST API was created by the Steinberg company,
makers of the popular Cubase audio/MIDI sequencer, and has been adopted
by developers and embraced by users worldwide. Properly speaking, a VST
plugin typically is an audio or MIDI processor, and a VSTi plugin
is an instrument such as a synthesizer or drum machine. Thousands of
VST/VSTi plugins exist today, ranging from the homemade to
the costly and commercial. Many free-of-charge VST plugins are quite good, and
some VST authors have released their plugins as truly free open-source
software licensed under the GPL.
</p></div><p>
Ardour's documentation is another lively issue, because
currently there is no official users' manual. It
is likely that Paul Davis will continue to make
Ardour freely available while charging a fee for a
high-quality manual. Meanwhile, users unfamiliar with
the basic design concepts of a hard-disk recorder are
advised to retrieve and study manuals for proprietary
DAWs, such as Pro Tools or Cubase. Some Ardour-specific
documentation can be found in the source package
text files and in various on-line resources, such as
the Quick Toots series (see Resources), and
in the traffic on the ardour-users and ardour-dev
mail lists. Developers and testers also communicate
on the #ardour IRC channel, while normal users carry
on considerable discussion of Ardour-related matters
on the mail lists for AGNULA/Demudi, Planet CCRMA,
ALSA and the Linux Audio Users group.
</p><p>
Is Ardour ready for the big time? Perhaps not quite
yet, but its road map is clearly headed there,
and the remaining trip won't take long. I believe
that it will be only a short time before Ardour
starts raising eyebrows in the mainstream commercial
audio software world. Ardour already has been used to
record and mix entire CD projects, and more users are
reporting success with Ardour in their own recording
projects. I expect to be making a lot more music with
Ardour. Feel free to stop by my site and check
the occasional results.
