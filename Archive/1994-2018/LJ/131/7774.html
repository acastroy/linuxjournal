Some legacy database applications are prime candidates for
replacement with LAMP-based Web applications. Richard Hulse explains
how Radio New Zealand completed such a project.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Radio New Zealand is a public radio broadcaster, and as with other
broadcasters, we have a huge library of music and programmes about
music. In 1987, a new computerized library cataloging system, called
BRS, was commissioned to assist broadcasters in the storage of library data.
</p><p>
Specifically, BRS was used to store data about LPs
(and later CDs), tapes, live concert recordings,
interviews and the collection of classical music
scores. The system was accessed by way of dumb terminals
and, later, terminal emulators on PCs. It also was
used by radio staff to schedule and track the music
broadcast on Concert FM&mdash;the
company's classical music network.
</p><p>
BRS was a proprietary cataloging application sold by
Maxwell Online, Inc. It ran on UNIX and had a long life. It had a couple
of hardware upgrades during its 16-year life; on the software side, a few
extra database tables were added for other types of data.
BRS survived Y2K without a glitch, in spite of claims to the contrary,
and in 2003 talks began in earnest to replace it.

DIY-IT</h2></div></div><p>
In the past, a replacement project of this nature probably would have been
outsourced. Experience has shown, however, that in some cases we'd end up
with a closed-source custom application and be locked in to one company
for ongoing upgrades and modifications. Sometimes when these companies cease
trading and people move on, the application we depend on becomes an
orphan, and the data is difficult or impossible to move to a new application.
</p><p>
DIY projects are not always appropriate, and we carefully weighed all
the issues. Because of the critical nature of both the data and the
application, plus the availability of in-house skills, we felt it was
appropriate in this case to undertake the project ourselves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0e608"></a>
Hello BRAD</h2></div></div><p>
Bruce Intemann from our IT department was the project leader and put
together a quick proof of concept on a desktop PC running Red Hat Linux
8, an Apache Web server, MySQL and PHP (LAMP). Bruce was able to work out
how to extract the data from BRS in plain-text format, and he constructed a
simple search interface based on the Full-text Index of MySQL, with a small sample of
the data converted by hand. Access was granted by way of a standard Web browser.
</p><p>
Around this time, I was completing a PHP Web project for another part
of the company and offered my skills to this new project. When it came to name
the system, I thought it would be nice to retain the B and R since the
they are the first initials of the system's &ldquo;parents&rdquo;. My wife came up
with the name BRAD, and one of our staff decided the acronym stood for Bruce and
Richard's Audio Database. The name stuck.
</p><p>
After the proof of concept was accepted, I wrote a short Perl script to parse
all the data&mdash;about 200,000 records&mdash;and insert it into the MySQL
database. This was complicated because several of the smaller databases
had been merged into the main database, Works,
to aid global searching. Fortunately, one field was used to indicate the
location (source) of the original data. See Listing 1 for a sample of BRS data.

</pre></div><p>
Once a complete snapshot of the data was transferred, I rewrote Bruce's
code using object-oriented PHP. I also utilised a search class I wrote for
another project, modifying it to display music data instead of
news stories.
</p><p>
The rough-and-ready demo was deployed on a development server, and
staff members were asked for comments. Based on their responses, we decided the best way to
proceed was to improve the system continually based on staff feedback,
alongside the operation of the existing system. Dual
operation during development ensured that staff still had access to a
working system and also allowed comparisons between the search results
obtained from both systems. It also allowed staff to gain confidence in using the
new system and the results it presented.
</p><p>
To separate out the data into its original sets, a more complex script
was written to parse the data files, un-merging all the original data
sources from BRS. These sets were inserted into the separate databases
and tables shown in Figure 1. Each division of the company is considered a zone in
BRAD, and each data source is known as a section. Any zone can contain
aliases to sections in other zones or options to search across any list
of tables, regardless of where they are in the system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7774f1.large.jpg"><img src="7774f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The arrangement of BRAD's data sources. The table marked *
represents an alias to another table outside the current zone.
</p></div></div><p>
The BRS database was flat (nonrelational), and data had
been entered by different people in different formats over many years. As
I viewed the results of each snapshot going into the new system, I adjusted
the Perl script to clean up some of the data anomalies&mdash;particularly in
date fields. For example, the original text date field for the last update to a
record was edited manually in the past&mdash;in BRAD this is a
datetime field maintained by the system. Fields also were added to track
the creation date.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0ec90"></a>
BRAD Meets Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
BRAD was built on a server running LAMP, and it seemed
obvious that we should use open-source PHP classes
in its development. PHP Extension and Application
Repository (PEAR) modules were used for database
access, form generation and processing and basic
error handling. An existing error class was modified
to warn of an error but hide the full message from
the user.
</p><p>
Whenever I needed a particular function, I went looking for an open-source
module before writing my own. Doing so dramatically sped up the
development cycle (see Table 1 for a list of modules used in BRAD).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0edf0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Open-Source Modules Used in BRAD

Meeting Expectations</h2></div></div><p>
Because the BRS system had been around for so long, staff had refined
their use of the system to a high degree. BRS did have a powerful
and fast search facility. It was able to search for particular words in
all or any fields specified by the user. Some quirks had to be overcome,
however, such as stop words, words not indexed. These included complete
names of some musical groups, The Who being one example. In this
particular case, to find items by The Who you
have to know something else about the group, such as one of the members
(Pete Townsend) or something they wrote (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tommy</em></span>). Neither approach
always was reliable.
</p><p>
The sometimes unexpected behavior and the difficulty of using a
command-line interface meant that most staff used the music librarian to find
items, simply presenting a handwritten list of requests.
Among the expectations for the new system were an equal or better search
capability and a simplified interface that could be used by anyone with
minimal training.
</p><p>
One of the most powerful features of BRS was that you could limit search
terms to certain fields, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Mozart.cp. piano
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0f6e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would return anything with Mozart in the composer (cp) field and piano
in any field. We decided to retain this syntax in BRAD so that power
users still could do the kinds of searches they were used to doing. We
had planned to add an advanced search page for BRAD; however, this syntax
has turned out to be so flexible that we haven't needed it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0f7e8"></a>
Overcoming Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
We faced several challenges with the project. Most of them had to do
with modifying MySQL's default behaviors to suit our requirements.
The first challenge was to remove all stop words&mdash;the list
of words not indexed by MySQL due to their presumed
commonality in the data. In our situation, every word is
considered important.
</p><p>
In MySQL, removing stop words is achieved simply by adding the following line to the
MySQL configuration file before adding anything to the database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ft_stopword_file = ""
</pre>
</p><p>
The second challenge was to allow searches for words smaller than the
four-character limit typically used by MySQL. The BRS system indexed
every word regardless of size, apart from those listed as stop words,
and removing all stop words would make any search results more in-line
with the terms entered.
</p><p>
This problem was solved by doing two things. First, we reduced the index
word size to three characters by adding the following to the config
file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set-variable = ft_min_word_len=3
</pre>
</p><p>
Because of the amount of data, these settings were considered to be
acceptable performance trade-offs.
</p><p>
The second thing we did was implement a smart query engine that
adapted the query, depending on the shortest word in the search terms,
before sending it MySQL. This allows full-text searching regardless of
the length of any search term.
</p><p>
The last challenge was to make all searches AND by default. MySQL's
boolean full-text mode is an OR search when no modifiers are used. You
normally would add a + before each term to make it an AND search. The
query engine was built to add the + automatically when no other modifier
is present.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf0fbb0"></a>
The Query Compiler</h2></div></div><p>
At the core of BRAD is a term parser and a query compiler. The term
parser takes a query, breaks it down and places the components into an
array. The array contains a MySQL modifier, +, -, &lt;, &gt;, ~; an atom, a part of
the query string&mdash;either a word or a phrase; and an optional field name.
</p><p>
The term parser automatically adds a + to each atom when no modifier
is present, making all searches AND by default. This is a good thing
because users expect that this is how a search engine
will work&mdash;the more terms you add, the more refined the search.
</p><p>
The optional field is used to support advanced searches when particular
words are required in a specific field. In BRAD we retained the .
field search operator.
</p><p>
When a normal search is undertaken, the query compiler interrogates
each table within the scope of the search and returns a list of full-text
fields for each. These are used to compile a query that spans all the
full-text fields.
</p><p>
The query compiler can manage a mix of full-text general terms and non-full-text, field-specific terms. The query compiler allows BRAD's data
sources to be extended almost without limit and the generated queries
to adapt dynamically&mdash;removing the need for static query boilerplates
for each object class that represents real objects in the database.
</p><p>
A standard Web page form allows the user to control all
aspects of the search (Figure 2). Users can select as few or as many zones
or tables as they want. These can be customised to meet company and user
requirements.

Extending BRAD</h2></div></div><p>
BRAD was written to be extensible in all respects. The data searching
can be extended to any kind of data, and specific kinds of searches can
be applied to that data.
</p><p>
One of the problems that existed in our company was the use of different
database applications for different tasks, with different data being
spread across several applications. Our two radio networks use an
application called Selector to schedule music
items for air. One database, with around 10,000 music tracks, is used for
National Radio, while 100,000 music tracks spread across five databases
are used for Concert FM. Five databases are used for Concert FM due to
limitations in the size of data that Selector can handle.
</p><p>
If a staff member wanted to search for a piece of music, he or she would have
to go to each of three applications&mdash;BRS, National Radio Selector and
Concert FM Selector. There was no way to search all of these at one time.
</p><p>
Fortunately, Selector has a utility to export data in XML format. Although
there is no documentation for this and none could be obtained, Bruce
was able to determine how to run the export utility and FTP the data to
the BRAD server from a Windows workstation. This is done each morning,
and a Perl script is run on BRAD to import all the data. The five Concert
FM databases are merged into one table, as all the data is unique.
</p><p>
The original search module was extended to search more than one table and
return the results, regardless of the number or type of fields. Results
are displayed in a tab-style manner (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7774f3.large.jpg"><img src="7774f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Truncated Page of Results
</p></div></div><p>
You can see the first results from the Works table. The other inactive tab
shows the number of results in the CFM Selector table. Depending on the
scope of the search and the results, any number of tabs might be showing.
Producers now can search any of the music data from one simple interface.
</p><p>
Since the first Alpha version was released, many other new features have been
added at the request of the staff. Among these are a search history and
a shopping cart. The cart can hold items from any table. Carts can be
saved and restored, and once created, a cart number also can be e-mailed to
the librarian. This saves staff having to print or e-mail whole lists of
material&mdash;they simply e-mail the cart number.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf07c50"></a>
Finding NZ Content and Duration Search</h2></div></div><p>
The most recent feature that was added was the alias search. An alias
replaces a more complex set of terms that might be used a lot. An example
of this is a search for New Zealand content&mdash;music that contains NZ
artists or was composed by a New Zealander. This is useful as we have
self-imposed NZ music quotas for both networks.
</p><p>
Over many years of data entry and staff changes, different fields
and identifiers were used to indicate NZ status in the main Works
database. The NZ Music alias automatically adds the required terms
and fields to the query as an OR search. This was achieved by building
a new class on top of the term parser and using it to extract any aliases
from the query. The parser then adds the required parameters to the query
stack maintained by the Query Complier. Here are some BRAD Alias examples.
The query:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Mozart @nza
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf07e08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
gives us Mozart and any NZ content field true. The actual query looks
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

SELECT * FROM brs.works WHERE (cf REGEXP '[[:&lt;:]]local[[:&gt;:]]' OR cf
REGEXP '[[:&lt;:]]nz[[:&gt;:]]' OR lq REGEXP '[[:&lt;:]]nz[[:&gt;:]]') AND MATCH
ti,ra,cf,cd,cp,so,at,notes,lq AGAINST ('+Mozart' IN BOOLEAN MODE) ORDER BY ti asc LIMIT 1000

</pre>
</p><p>
A duration search also was added so that producers can find material
within certain ranges&mdash;it is quite common to need music by a certain
composer of approximately a known duration. In BRAD, numbers in square
brackets are treated as a duration query. BRAD can do approximate searches
or searches within a range of
durations. See the sidebar for some examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf07fc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
BRAD Duration Examples
</b></p><p>
Less than:

<pre     class="programlisting">

brahms [&lt;20]

</pre>
</p><p>
Between (you also can specify a range of times). The following looks for
anything with mozart in it that is between 20 minutes, 30 seconds and 30
minutes, 15 seconds:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozart [20:30-30:15]
</pre>
</p><p>
Approximate matches&mdash;this looks for the time you specify plus or
minus 10%; c is short for
circa:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozart [ c 24 ]
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can add a time range. The following input retrieves items 24 minutes in
length, plus or minus 1 minute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozart [ c 24 r 1 ]
</pre>
</p><p>
Complex duration searches&mdash; the following searches for pieces with Beethoven as the
composer that last between 20 and 22 minutes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
beethoven.cp [20-22]
</pre>
</p><p>
The query compiled for the last search:

<pre     class="programlisting">

SELECT * FROM cfm.cfms WHERE (du &lt;= 1320)
  AND (du &gt;= 1200)
  AND MATCH ti,ca,ma, ra,cd,cp,so,at,notes AGAINST
    ('+beethoven' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
  AND MATCH cp AGAINST ('+beethoven' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
  ORDER BY ti asc LIMIT 1000

</pre>
</p></div><p>
The Concert FM Selector data mentioned earlier has NZ artist and duration
fields set correctly for all data, so these aliases can be used reliably
on the whole data set. Because there is a mix of item types in the Works
data, only those with a valid duration are searched. In the past, it was
not possible to do any duration search at all within Works, so
this is an improvement.

The Future</h2></div></div><p>
At the time of writing, I was asked about putting the company phone
directory into BRAD, and a proof-of-concept pronunciation guide was added
for our News department.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe16580.0xf086a0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This project has enabled us to replace a key Radio NZ cataloging system
and provide enhanced functionality to staff at a low TCO. It also has
provided a storage platform for new and legacy data.
</p><p>
In the future, it may be possible for programme producers to do a single
search on a composer or artist and get back a whole set of results
that includes music tracks, interviews and archival material. It even could
indicate the correct pronunciation of the person's name and provide his
or her phone number.
</p><p>
BRAD probably will continue to be a work in progress as we find more
uses for it. This is one of the benefits of DIY-IT&mdash;the system is
ours to extend or modify as we see fit, whenever we need to do so.
