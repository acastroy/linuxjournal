can provide a no hassle method for alternating between them.</p><p>After reviewing System Commander for a week or so I can say
that this program does exactly what it says it does&mdash;somewhat.
Before I get into details, let me say a few things about my
experiences with the program. All testing was done on a generic
laptop using a 486DX-33 with 4MB RAM.</p><p>To begin with, I was anxious to get started when I received
my review copy, and the first thing I did was break into the
package and begin to scan the owner's manual. Perhaps it was just
the copy I received, or perhaps I was overly rough in my eagerness,
but the manual did not seem to hold up well to handling&mdash;within
minutes the spine was beginning to separate from the pages. My
first thought was that if this was any indication of the quality
assurance program at V Communications, I was going to be in
trouble. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded. While the manual was
the weakest link physically, it turned out I didn't need to bend
the pages often enough for it to matter. It has got to be one of
the best laid out manuals I've run a cross in a long time. Got a
question on the installation? If the manual doesn't cover it, the
on-line help probably will.</p><p>As to the System Commander program, you will need about 1/2MB
uncompressed hard disk space for the installation. Each copy is
licensed for a single user only. The installation program has a
basic Master Boot Record virus checker and prompts you several
times to read chapter 3 of the manual regardless of how secure you
feel in the installation process. Personally, as easy as the
program is to use, I <span   class="bold"><b>HIGHLY</b></span>
recommend you read the manual thoroughly. There are some quirks
specific to certain operating systems that can really cause
headaches.</p><p>Something to consider before using System Commander is
exactly which OS you will be using. Some preliminary planning and
decision making prior to beginning can save you many hours of
frustration, as I found out the hard way. Unless you really enjoy
backing up your hard drive and repartitioning two or three times
you might consider getting a copy of Partition Magic or a similar
program to save time. If you have already partitioned your drive
and have several different OSes already, you are ready to
roll&mdash;unless you are masochistic enough to want to install Windows
95 later. Suffice it to say, the manual devotes
<span   class="bold"><b>MANY</b></span> pages to the installation
&ldquo;quirks&rdquo; of Win95. Once you have your hard drive partitioned the
way you want/need it though, the rest is a snap.</p><p>System Commander lives up to its promise of being easy to use
and fairly intuitive. It also delivers on the promise to remove
itself completely from RAM after your OS selection is made. While
the specifics of how it does this are beyond the scope of this
review, it works.</p><p>There are a few things though that disturbed me. The manual
says nothing about backing up your original disk and using the
backup for the actual installation. This should be obvious to most
seasoned users, but it is particularly important in this instance.
The installation process places System Commander on your hard drive
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>saves the original boot record to the floppy for
later restoration should you decide to uninstall</em></span>. I
don't know about you, but in my opinion, anything that writes back
to the disk needs to be run from a copy.</p><p>Another inadequate feature of System Commander is something
called &ldquo;user ID&rdquo;. This feature is supposed to let you leave
personal information for later identification should the computer
be stolen. The problem is that it is too easy to remove. The same
problem occurs in the &ldquo;password&rdquo; protection routine. Supposedly,
if this option is chosen, the system cannot be used without the
password. Unfortunately, if you don't (or can't) set the CMOS to
boot from the hard drive before the floppy, the entire point is
moot&mdash;any old system disk will boot you up. Even worse, if you set
the password and forget it, it is going to cost you to get access
to your system again. V Communications has a &ldquo;special&rdquo; service
for getting you back into the system. You best have your dialing
finger and credit card ready though before you call. The upshot is,
most people will figure it's not worth it to turn on the password
function, which totally defeats its purpose.</p><p>Another tiny glitch I ran across involves warm boots. While I
know most people don't do some of the things I do with my system (I
<span   class="bold"><b>REALLY</b></span> like to test things out),
if you start the system and then give it the CTRL+ALT+DEL salute
while the selection menu is on the screen, the system locks
totally. Not a problem for most people, but it leaves a little tiny
nagging doubt in the back of my head: &ldquo;If this locks the system,
can anything else do it too?&rdquo; Fortunately, it didn't happen in any
other situation.</p><p>Now, back to my earlier statement. System Commander really
does what it says, somewhat. The advertising expounds the ability
to run up to 100 OSes on the same computer. However, this is true
only if you count MS-DOS 3.0, MS-DOS 3.1, MS-DOS 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
PC-DOS 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, DR-DOS 5.0, 6.0, etc., etc., etc., as
separate operating systems. If I were to be generous, I might say
that MS-DOS, DR-DOS and PC-DOS are different operating systems, but
not the different versions of each. You also have to count Win95
(English version), Win95 (Spanish version), etc., as separate
operating systems to make the count reach 100. But then, who would
want two, (or, shudder at the thought, THREE) copies of Win95 on
the same computer? I guess if you want to get technical about it,
it does run 100 OSes, but most of us will probably not have more
than two or three.</p><p>So, what are my overall thoughts on this program? Well, as
for what it claims to do, I give it a big thumbs up. As to its
practical uses, I give it a conditional thumbs up. If you regularly
use two widely different operating systems, you may want to
consider this system. It would probably be very useful to someone
who uses Win95 and another OS. I would also declare that it might
prove useful to those who do a lot of cross-platform programming.
However, I am a bit turned off by the price tag. If you use only
Linux and DOS for instance, you probably would be satisfied with
LILO, and would consider System Commander to be LILO with eye-candy
added. If you use OS/2 with DOS 6.x, you might find it interesting.
If you use Win95 with older DOS versions, you would probably find
it useful. I just have a hard time with the suggested list price of
$99. I'm sorry, but I'm a cheapskate at heart. If the list were
more like $30 or even $40, I wouldn't hesitate. Perhaps those who
use operating systems such as Solaris and Xenix or QNX wouldn't
mind the price, if it saves them some trouble. Being unfamiliar
with those systems, I can't say for sure. The bottom line is, how
much is it worth to you? It is easy to use. I'd check my other
options first, and if they were just too much trouble, then I'd
consider System Commander.</p></div></div>
