    While Linux seems a natural solution for many applications, when
    milliseconds become critical, a robust multitasking environment may be
    too busy. RT-Linux gets the system under control to meet real-time
    computing needs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e7580.0x24df660"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you wanted to control a camera or a
robot or a scientific instrument from a PC, it would be natural to
think of using Linux so you could take advantage of the development
environment, the X Window System, and all the networking support.
However, Linux cannot reliably run these kinds of hard real-time
applications. A simple experiment can illustrate the problem. Take
a speaker and hook it up to one of the pins from the parallel port;
then run a program that toggles the pin. If your program is the
only one running, the speaker will produce a nice, somewhat steady
tone&mdash;not completely steady, but not bad. When Linux updates the
file system every couple of seconds, you might notice a small
change in tone. If you move the mouse over a couple of windows the
tone becomes irregular. If you start Netscape, you hear intervals
of silence as your program waits for higher priority processes to
run.
</p><p>The problem is that Linux, like most general purpose
operating systems, is designed to optimize
<span   class="emphasis"><em>average</em></span> performance and to try to give every
process a fair share of compute time. This is great for general
purpose computing, but for real-time programming, precise timing
and predictable performance are more important than average
performance. For example, if a camera fills a buffer every
millisecond, a momentary delay in the process reading that buffer
can cause data loss. If a stepper motor in a lithography machine
must be turned on and off at precise intervals in order to minimize
vibration and to move a wafer into position at the correct time, a
momentary delay may cause an unrecoverable failure. Consider what
might happen if the task that causes an emergency shutdown of a
chemistry experiment must wait to run until Netscape redraws the
window.</p><p>It turns out redesigning Linux to provide guaranteed
performance would take an enormous amount of work. And taking on
such a job would defeat our original purpose. Instead of having an
off the shelf general purpose OS, we would have a custom-made
special purpose OS that would not be riding the wave of the main
Linux development effort. So we slipped a small, simple, real-time
operating system <span   class="emphasis"><em>underneath</em></span> Linux. Linux
becomes a task run only when there is no real-time task to run, and
we pre-empt Linux whenever a real-time task needs the processor.
The changes needed in Linux itself are minimal. Linux is mostly
unaware of the real-time operating system as it goes about its
business of running processes, catching interrupts, and controlling
devices. Real-time tasks can run at quite a high level of
precision. In our test P120 system, we can schedule tasks to run
within a precision of about 20 microseconds.</p><p>Real-time Linux is a research project with two goals. First,
we want a practical, non-proprietary tool we can use to control
scientific instruments and robots. Our other goal is to use
RT-Linux for research in real and non-real-time OS design. We'd
like to be able to learn something about how to make operating
systems efficient and reliable. For example, even a non-real-time
operating system should be able to determine whether it can
guarantee timing needed for its I/O devices. We're also interested
in what types of scheduling disciplines actually turn out to be the
most useful for real-time applications. Following this dual
purpose, in this paper we discuss both how to use RT-Linux and how
it works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e7580.0x24df920"></a>Using RT-Linux 2.0.RT.1</h2></div></div><p>Let us consider an example. Suppose we want to write an
application that polls a device for data in real-time and stores
this data in a file. The main design philosophy behind RT-Linux is
the following:</p><p>Real-time programs should be split into small, simple parts,
with hard real-time constraints, and larger parts that do more
sophisticated processing.</p><p>Following this principle, we split our application into two
parts. The hard-real-time part will execute as a real-time task and
copy data from the device into a special I/O interface called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real-time fifo</em></span>. The main part of the program
will execute as an ordinary Linux process. This part will read data
from the other end of the real-time fifo and display and store the
data in a file.</p><p>The real-time component will be written as a kernel module.
Linux allows us to compile and load kernel modules without
rebooting the system. Code for a module always starts with a define
of MODULE and an include of the module.h file. After that, we
include the real-time header files <b  >rt_sched.h</b>
and <b  >rt_fifo.h</b> and declare an
<b  >RT_TASK</b> structure.</p><pre     class="programlisting">#define MODULE
#include &lt;linux/module.h&lt;
/* always needed for real-time tasks */
#include &lt;linux/rt_sched.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/rt_fifo.h&gt;
RT_TASK mytask;</pre><p>The real-time task structure will contain pointers to code,
data, and scheduling information for this task. The task structure
is defined in the first include file. Currently, RT-Linux has only
one fairly simple scheduler. In the future, the schedulers will
also be loadable modules. Currently, the only way for real-time
tasks to communicate with Linux processes is through special queues
called real-time fifos. Real-time fifos have been designed so that
the real-time task will never be blocked when it reads or writes
data. Figure 1 illustrates real-time fifos.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0232f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Real-time fifos
</p></div></div><p>The example program will simply loop, reading data from the
device, writing the data to an RT-fifo, and waiting for a fixed
amount of time.</p><pre     class="programlisting">/* this is the main program */
void mainloop(int fifodesc) {
        int data;
        /* in this loop we obtain data from */
        /* the device and put it into the */
        /* fifo number 1 */
        while (1) {
                data = get_data();
                rt_fifo_put(fifodesc, (char *)
                  &amp;data, sizeof(data));
                  /* give up the CPU till the */
                  /* next period              */
                rt_task_wait();
        }
}</pre><p>All modules must contain an initialization routine. The
initialization routine for the example real-time task will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>record the current time,</p></li><li><p>initialize the real-time task structure,</p></li><li><p>and put the task on the periodic schedule.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >rt_task_init</b> routine initializes the
task structure and arranges for an argument to be passed to the
task. In this case, the argument is a fixed descriptor for a
real-time fifo. The <b  >rt_make_periodic</b> routine
puts the new task on the periodic scheduling queue. Periodic
scheduling means the task is scheduled to run at certain intervals
in time units. The alternative is to make the task run only when an
interrupt causes it to become active.</p><pre     class="programlisting">This function is needed in any module. It */
/* will be invoked when the module is loaded. */

        rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;mytask, now +
            1000, 25000);
        return 0;
}`</pre><p>Linux also requires that every module have a cleanup routine.
For a real-time task, we want to make sure a dead task is no longer
scheduled.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

/* module is unloaded.                     */
void cleanup_module(void)
{
        /* kill the realxi--time task */
        rt_task_delete(&amp;mytask);
}
</pre><p>That's the end of the module. We also need a program which
runs as an ordinary Linux process. In this example, the process
will just read data from the fifo and write (copy) the data to

non-real-time. The fifo size must be big enough to avoid overflows.
Overflows can be detected, and another fifo can be used to inform
the main program about them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e7580.0x24e05d8"></a>Why Linux Can't Do Real-Time and Why Simple
Fixes Don't Work</h2></div></div><p>Although Linux has system calls for suspending a process for
a given time interval, it does not guarantee the process will be
resumed as soon as this interval has passed. Depending on system
load, the process might be scheduled more than a second later.
Furthermore, a user process can be preempted at an unpredictable
moment and forced to wait for its share of the CPU time. Assigning
the highest priorities to critical tasks does not help, partly
because of the Linux &ldquo;fair&rdquo; time-sharing scheduling algorithm. This
algorithm tries to make sure every user program gets its fair share
of computer time. Of course, if we have a real-time task, we want
it to get the CPU whenever it needs it, no matter how unfair that
may be. Linux virtual memory also contributes to unpredictability.
Pages belonging to any user process can be swapped out to disk at
any time. Bringing the requested page back to RAM takes an
unpredictable amount of time in Linux.</p><p>Some of these problems are easily, or somewhat easily, fixed.
It's possible to create a new class of special Linux processes
which are more real-time. We could change the scheduling algorithm,
so that real-time processes are scheduled round-robin or
periodically. We could <span   class="emphasis"><em>lock</em></span> a real-time
process into memory, so that its pages will never be swapped out.
In fact, both ideas are part of the POSIX.1b-1993 specification
which defines standards for &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; processes. And
POSIX.1b-1993 is being incorporated into Linux. In newer versions
of Linux, system calls are already provided for locking user pages
in memory, making the scheduler policy priority-based and even for
more predictable handling of signals.</p><p>POSIX.1b-1993 does not solve all our problems. It's not
intended to solve the kinds of problems we discussed at the
beginning of this article. The standard is aimed at so-called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>soft</em></span> real-time programs. A program which
displays video in a window is a perfect example of a soft real-time
task. We want this task to run quickly and quite often in order to
get a good quality display, but a few milliseconds here or there
won't make much difference. For hard real-time problems, the POSIX
standard has several drawbacks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux processes are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>heavyweight</em></span> processes associated with
significant overhead from process switching. Although Linux is
relatively fast in switching processes, it can take several hundred
microseconds on a fast machine. This would make it impossible to
schedule a task to poll a sensor every 200 microseconds.</p></li><li><p>Linux follows the standard Unix technique of making
kernel processes non-preemptive. That is, when a process is making
a system call (and running in kernel mode) it cannot be forced to
give up the processor to another task, no matter how high the
priority of the other task. For people who write operating systems,
this is wonderful, because it makes a lot of very complicated
synchronization problems disappear. For people who want to run
real-time programs it is not so wonderful, since important
processes cannot be scheduled while the kernel works on behalf of
even the least important process. In kernel mode, it cannot be
rescheduled. For example, if Netscape calls
<b  >fork</b>, the fork will complete before any other
process can run.</p></li><li><p>Linux disables interrupts in <span   class="emphasis"><em>critical
sections</em></span> of kernel code. This disabling of interrupts
means a real-time interrupt can be delayed until the current
process, no matter how low its priority, finishes its critical
section. Consider this piece of code:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">line1: temp = qhead;
line2: qhead = temp-&gt;next;</pre><p>Suppose that before the kernel gets to line 1,
<b  >qhead</b> contains the address of a data structure
that is the only data structure on the queue and that
<b  >qhead-&gt;next</b> contains 0. Now suppose the
kernel routine finishes line 1 and computes the value
<b  >temp-&gt;next</b> (which is 0), and then is halted
by an interrupt that causes a new element to be added the the
queue. When the interrupt routine finishes,
<b  >qhead-&gt;next</b> will not be equal to 0 any more,
but when the kernel routine continues it will assign the 0 value to
<b  >qhead</b> and so will lose the new element. To
prevent these types of errors, the Linux kernel makes extensive use
of the <b  >cli</b> command to <span   class="emphasis"><em>clear (disable)
interrupts</em></span> during these critical sections. The kernel
routine in this example would disable interrupts before it began
changing the queue and re-enable interrupts only when the operation
was complete; thus, interrupts would sometimes be delayed. It's
hard to calculate the worst possible delay that can be caused by a
critical section. You'd have to carefully examine the code for
every driver (and much of the rest of the OS as well) to even make
a good estimate. We've measured delays of as long as 1/2
millisecond. Consider what such a delay would mean to our camera
routine.</p><p>Changing the Linux kernel to be a preemptable real-time
kernel with low interrupt processing latency would require
substantial rewriting of the Linux kernel code&mdash;almost writing a
new one. Real-time Linux uses a simpler and more efficient
solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e7580.0x28d9170"></a>How RT-Linux Works</h2></div></div><p>The basic idea is to make Linux run under the control of a
real-time kernel (See Figure 2). When there is real-time work to be
done, the RT operating system runs one of its tasks. When there is
no real-time work to be done, the real-time kernel schedules Linux
to run. So Linux is the lowest priority task of the
RT-kernel.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0232f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2
</p></div></div><p>The problem with Linux disabling interrupts is solved by
simulating the Linux interrupt-related routines in the real-time
kernel. For example, whenever the Linux kernel invokes the
<b  >cli() -</b> routine that is supposed to disable
interrupts, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span> interrupt flag is reset
instead. All interrupts get caught by the RT-kernel and passed to
the Linux kernel according to the state of this flag and the
interrupt mask. Therefore, the interrupts are always available for
the RT-kernel, while still allowing Linux to &ldquo;disable&rdquo; them. In the
example above, the Linux kernel routine would call
<b  >cli()</b> to clear the soft interrupt flag. If an
interrupt occurred, the real-time executive would catch it and
decide what to do. If the interrupt caused a real-time task to be
run, the executive would save the state of Linux and start the
real-time task immediately. If the interrupt just needed to be
passed along to Linux, the real-time executive would set a flag
showing a pending interrupt, then resume Linux execution without
running the Linux interrupt handler. When Linux re-enables
interrupts, the real-time executive will process all pending
interrupts and cause the corresponding Linux handlers to
execute.</p><p>The real-time kernel is itself non-preemptable, but since its
routines are very small and fast, this does not cause big delays.
Testing on a Pentium 120 shows the maximum scheduling delay to be
less than 20ms.</p><p>Real-time tasks run at the kernel privilege level in order to
provide direct access to the computer hardware. They have fixed
allocations of memory for code and data&mdash;otherwise, we would have
to allow for unpredictable delays when a task requests new memory
or pages in a code page. Real-time tasks cannot use Linux system
calls or directly call routines or access ordinary data structures
in the Linux kernel, as this would introduce the possibility of
inconsistencies. In our example above, the kernel routine changing
the queue would invoke <b  >cli</b>, but this would not
prevent a real-time task from starting. So we cannot allow the
real-time task to directly access the queue. We do, however, need a
way for real-time tasks to exchange data with the kernel and with
user tasks. In a data collection application, for example, we might
need to send the data collected by an RT-task over the network, or
write it locally to a file, while displaying it on the
screen.</p><p>Real-time fifos are used to pass information between
real-time processes and ordinary Linux processes. RT-fifos, like
real-time tasks, are never paged out. This eliminates the problem
of unpredictable delays due to paging. And real-time fifos are
designed to never block the real-time task.</p><p>Finally, the question&mdash;how the real-time kernel keeps track
of the real-time&mdash;arises. When implementing schedulers for
real-time systems, there is usually a tradeoff between the rate of
clock interrupts and <span   class="emphasis"><em>task release jitter</em></span>.
Typically, sleeping tasks are resumed during the execution of the
periodic clock interrupt handler. A comparatively low clock
interrupt rate does not impose much overhead, but at the same time
causes tasks to be resumed either prematurely or too late. In
real-time Linux, this problem is obviated by using a
high-granularity, one-shot timer in addition to standard periodic
clock interrupts. Tasks are resumed in the timer interrupt handler
precisely when needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e7580.0x28d97a0"></a>What's Next for RT-Linux</h2></div></div><p>The current version of RT-Linux is available by anonymous ftp
