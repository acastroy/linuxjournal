    This article is neither a Python tutorial nor
    a CGI tutorial, but a &ldquo;Python
    Presentation from a CGI perspective&rdquo;.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x19073f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Python Reference Manual abstract
describes Python as:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A simple yet powerful, interpreted programming
language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and
is thus ideally suited for &ldquo;throw-away programming&rdquo; and rapid
prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed
from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences
from ABC, C Modula-3 and Icon ... Python is available for various
operating systems, amongst which are several flavors of Unix
(including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS Windows
3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2.</p></blockquote></div><p>It should also be noted that Python is an object-oriented
language. You can write classes like in C++ or Java. I use Python
every time the common guy would use Perl [&ldquo;common guy&rdquo;?
Sheesh!&mdash;Ed, who is a die-hard Perl fan]. It has about the same
functionality, while being far more readable. But it should not be
restricted to a scripting language&mdash;a lot of people are using it
for complete applications. It's also a perfect glue language, like
Tcl, because it's easy to add new modules (written in C) to it. It
can also be embedded in C applications.</p><p><a href="1368l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows my very
first Python script. It's still used on a file server at the
office. It deletes ~*.tmp left everywhere by buggy MS Windows
applications. It's not really the common Hello World program (we'll
see one later), and maybe it's not the most efficient way to do the
job, but it demonstrates several features of the language:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Variables</b></span>:
Variables don't have to be declared.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Recursivity</b></span>: See
the <b  >ScanDir()</b> function.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Platform
independence</b></span>: The os module provides constants for
current directory, parent directory, and so on. See os.curdir,
os.pardir...</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>for statement and
lists</b></span>: In Python, for works differently than in C.
<b  >os.listdir()</b> returns a list of files. For
example, in Listing 1, at each iteration of:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        for p in files
</pre></li></ul></div><p><b  >p</b> will become the value of the next
element in the list. So, if <b  >files</b> is a triplet
with values:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        ['lib', 'include', 'src' ]
</pre><p>The first time, <b  >p</b> will be
<b  >'lib'</b>. At the second iteration, it will be
<b  >'include'</b>, and so on, until it has gone through
the whole list.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Arrays and
indices</b></span>: An array can be referred with one or two
indices. One index is used to get a single element from the array
(like in C). Two indices can be used to get a subset of the array.
The first index gives the <span   class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> element, while
the second one gives the <span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> element. For
example, if <span   class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> is an array containing the
values <b  >'abcdef'</b>, <b  >a[ 2 : 4 ]</b>
will return <b  >'cd'</b>. There are defaults for both
indices: they default to <b  ><i><tt>from the
start</tt></i></b> and to <b  ><i><tt>to the
end</tt></i></b> respectively. Examples: <b  >a[ 2 :
]</b> will return <b  >'cdef'</b>. Negative indices
can be used to count from the end; <b  >a[ -2 ]</b> will
return <b  >'e'</b>. See the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
Tutorial</em></span> at the Python web site (http://www.Python.org/)
to learn more about arrays.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Blocks</b></span>: Unlike C
or Pascal-derived languages, there are no
<b  >Start-Block</b> or <b  >End-Block</b>
separators. Python works only with indentations (and the &ldquo;:&rdquo;
character).</p></li></ul></div><p>One of my colleagues in the firmware department recently had
some problems debugging a TCP/IP application he is writing. There
is a server application running in an embedded system, and a client
application running on a PC. He was stuck for two days with a
protocol problem, and didn't even know if the problem came from the
client or from the server. Every test version meant recompiling,
eventually downloading the code in the embedded system, and so on.
In addition, it's not always easy to debug a device that doesn't
even have a screen&mdash;you get the point.</p><p>So, after we discussed his problems, I decided to write
little Python test programs to test his applications. In less than
a quarter of an hour, I had tested his server application. This
included writing a Python script and running it on a console of a
Linux box, concurrently to tcpdump. Since the problem didn't come
from the server, I wrote another program to test his client
application. This script masqueraded the server, and we immediately
discovered the problem. My colleague was very impressed by the
short time it took me to write those two scripts, so I gave him a
copy of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Tutorial</em></span>.</p><p>Some simple scripts using sockets can be found in
<a href="1368l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2a and2b</a>. They are from
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Library Reference</em></span>.</p><p>My company sells time and attendance software in a
client/server environment. Supported platforms include Unix and NT.
The biggest problem with time and attendance is that, although
general functionalities are the same for all our customers, they
all have special specific rules. That's why the software department
is considering the inclusion of the Python interpreter in their
software. It would allow on-site customization, and it is available
on all our platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x19089a0"></a>Documentation and Availability</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Python home page is located at
http://www.python.org/. On the site there is a list of mirror
sites, and the current distribution of Python.</p></li><li><p>A tutorial and other documents including the
Language Reference, Library Reference, a guide on how to extend and
embed the interpreter and a FAQ can be found in the doc directory
of the Python Home Page (http://www.python.org/doc/).</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Two books will soon be available about Python:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Python</em></span>, by Mark
Lutz, O'Reilly and Associates Publishers.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming with
Python</em></span>, by Aaron Watters, Guido Van Rossum (the author
of the language) and James Ahlstrom, from MIS Press/Henry Holt
Publishers. See http://www.python.org/python/arwbook.html.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>And finally, there's a newsgroup devoted to Python:
comp.lang.python.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1d01278"></a>CGI Scripts</h2></div></div><p>In the following text, I will assume that you run your own
HTTP daemon locally. My preference is Apache, but any server will
do the work, if properly configured.</p><p>And of course, you should have installed Python on your
system. You'll need to configure it to use the gdbm module, since
it's used in count.py.</p><p>For the examples of scripts which interface with a relational
database, I've used PostGres95 (and its contributed Python module,
PyGres95). PostGres95 is available from
http://www.ki.net/postgres95/. PyGres95 is available from
http://zen.via.ecp.fr/via_dvpt/products/pygres.html.</p><p>To understand the following text, you should know how to
write an HTML page, have a general idea of how CGI works, and have
a little background with C programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1d01488"></a>Common Scripts</h2></div></div><p><a href="1368l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>, helloworld.py, is
our first script. It's very simple. Run from the command line, it
will print an HTML document. But you should copy it to your cgi-bin
directory, then call it from your browser with the URL
http://localhost/cgi-bin/script.py.</p><p>This script displays a little message and the local time.
Here, you need to note only one thing: the script must send a
header describing the contents of the document. This is done by the
means of the <b  >Content-type</b> header. Common values
include <b  >text/html</b>,
<b  >text/plain</b>, <b  >image/gif</b> or
<b  >image/jpeg</b>. The header is terminated by a blank
line. It is used by the client browser, and won't appear in the
generated page. And, as you'll see, the script is executed, and not
just displayed in the browser. Everything printed to sys.stdout by
the script will be sent to the client, while error messages will go
to an error log (/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log, if you are
using Apache).</p><p><a href="1368l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> is the well-known
Count script written in Python. This is used to display a graphical
counter of the number of times that a particular page has been
accessed.</p><p>This script imports a module called cgi, which I'll describe
later. It's used to retrieve the URL parameter passed to the
script. This script interfaces with gdbm (which must be included in
the modules list when Python is configured) to store <b  >{ URL
; access count }</b> couples.</p><p>This is our first introduction to Python dictionaries. A
dictionary is generally referred to as an &ldquo;associative array&rdquo; in
the literature. It means that you can access arrays by keys instead
of indices. For example, if you want to handle an e-mail address
book, with couples like these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"Michel", "Michel.Vanaken@ping.be"
"Veronique", "Vero@home.sweet.home"
</pre><p>Here is how you should retrieve the address of Michel in C
   and in Python:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct {
        char    *key ;
        char    *addr ;
} email[ MAX ] ;
int     i ;
for( i=0 ; i&lt;MAX ; i++ ) {
  if( strcmp( email[ i ].key, "Michel" ) = 0 ) {
            printf( "%s\n", email[ i ].addr ) ;
            break ;
  }
}
if( i = MAX ) {
        printf( "Not found\n" ) ;
}
if email.has_key( "Michel" ) :
        print email[ "Michel" ]
else :
        print "Not found"
</pre><p>Adding an entry with Python is also very easy :</p><pre     class="programlisting">
email[ "Homer" ] =  \
"HSimpson@Springfield.power_plant.com"
</pre><p>adds an entry if <b  >Homer</b> is not a valid key, and
overwrites the old value if it is already present.
</p><p>We see that <b  >Content-type</b> here is
<b  >image/x-bitmap</b> (since the browser is waiting for
an <b  >&lt;img src=...&gt;</b>).</p><p>Of course, the bitmaps aren't very pretty (I drew them with a
paint package, saved them as xbm files, then used a lot of keyboard
macros and M-Kill/Yank rectangles in Emacs). The goal of this
script is not to reinvent the wheel, but to allow readers to
compare it with other versions widely available on the Net in
different languages.</p><p>In order to use this script, the gdbm database must be
created. Change the current directory to your cgi-bin directory,
run Python, and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
import gdbm
gdbm.open( "counters.gdbm", "n", 0666 )
</pre><p>and exit Python with Ctrl-D.
</p><p>It should also be noted that the xbm file created by this
script is bad. It contains an extraneous byte (added in the
<b  >print_footer()</b> function), in order to simplify
the <b  >print_digit_values()</b> function (in this
version, there are no tests for commas).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1d01fe0"></a>Debugging</h2></div></div><p>Before putting your CGI scripts on-line, you should be sure
that they're really clean, by testing them carefully, especially in
near bounds or out of bounds conditions. A script that crashes in
the middle of its job can cause large problems, like data
inconsistency in a database application. You can eliminate most of
the problems by running your script from the command line; then
testing it from your HTTP daemon.
</p><p>First, you have to remember that Python is an interpreted
language. This means that several syntax errors will not be
discovered until run time. You must be sure your script has been
tested in every part of the control flow. You can do that by
generating parameter sets that you will hardcode at the beginning
of your script.</p><p>Then, be sure that incorrect input cannot lead to an
incorrect behaviour of your script. Don't expect that all
parameters received by your script will be meaningful. They can be
corrupted during communication, or some hacker could try to obtain
more data then normally allowed.</p><p><a href="1368l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a> shows a different
version of our Hello World script and demonstrates the following
features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tuples</b></span>: Tuples are
arrays consisting of a number of values separated by commas. Ouput
tuples are enclosed in parenthesis. The localtime() function
returns a tuple which can be assigned in one variable (that becomes
a tuple). Or as in this script, individual elements of the tuple
can be assigned at one time to several variables.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>The elif (&ldquo;else if&rdquo;)
statement</b></span>: Listing 5 has two syntax errors that are not
detected when the interpreter loads the script, but will crash it
when executed. It will crash at Christmas, because there is a call
to a Christmas() function which has not been defined, and it will
crash again at the New Year's Day, because in addition to &ldquo;Happy
New Year!&rdquo;, it tries to print a &ldquo;Max&rdquo; variable which doesn't
exist (due perhaps to a cut-and-paste from a script intended to
wish someone happy birthday?). Here is what you'll find in the
error_log file if the script is accessed on Christmas:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "/cgi-bin/buggy.py", line 59, in ?
    Main()
  File "/cgi-bin/buggy.py", line 53, in Main
    Christmas()
NameError: Christmas
</pre></li></ul></div><p>The fact that the script seems to execute normally
(especially on New Year's Day, since everything that should have
been printed is actually printed) can be a pitfall. The script has
actually crashed!</p><p>Of course, in this script, crashing is not a big problem. But
in an Intranet application, it could be very harmful. Imagine, for
example, a script that displays a message saying it has updated
your stock database, but has in fact crashed immediately after
giving the message. The user thinks everything is going well, but
the data have not been updated.</p><p>Let's get back to Listing 4. We've already seen that the
generated xbm is not good; but maybe there are other problems. What
happens if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The script is called with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;img
src="http://localhost/cgi-bin/count.py?\
http://localhost/index.html"&gt;
</pre><p>instead of:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;img
src="http://localhost/cgi-bin/count.py?
_url=_http://localhost/index.html"&gt;?
</pre></li><li><p>The database file counters.gdbm does not
exist?</p></li><li><p>The access count exceeds 9999?</p></li></ul></div><p>I suggest you try these, and try your own solutions. For the
last situation in the list&mdash;the access count exceeds 9999&mdash;there
are several solutions; I suggest modifying the DIGITS value if the
incremented value in the <b  >inc_counter()</b> function
has a length that exceeds DIGITS. How would you see the generated
file if your web browser displays nothing? Maybe you could add the
following code, replace the call to <b  >CGImain()</b>
with <b  >TSTmain()</b> and run the script from the
command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def TSTmain() :
    #######
 url = "http://localhost/test.html"
 counter = get_put_counter( url )
 print_header()
 print_digits_values( counter )
 print_footer()
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1d02b38"></a>Form Handling</h2></div></div><p><a href="1368l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a> shows the HTML
source for a form we are going to discuss for the remainder of this
article. It allows the user to enter some values to perform a query
on a database. The action parameter of the form should be adapted
to your needs. For a real application, you should replace
<b  >localhost</b> by the fully qualified name of your
host. The name of the script should also be adapted to call the
right thing. Note that the HTML code defines a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hidden</em></span> field
(<b  >TableName</b>).</p><p>Let's start with a script that just echoes values entered by
the user (see <a href="1368l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a>). You'll
see that, even if you leave the form empty, two parameters are
displayed. The first one is (<b  >TableName</b>), a
hidden parameter in our form, and the second one is the value of
the <b  >Submit</b> button (which is also a field).
Notice that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >CGI module</b> imported by our
scripts is used to parse the input sent by an HTML form. It works
with <b  >GET</b> and <b  >POST</b>
methods.</p></li><li><p><b  >cgi.SvFormContentDict()</b> builds a
dictionary with:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        { field name ; field value }
</pre><p>couples corresponding to the data encoded by the user.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >cgi.escape()</b> is used to convert
special characters into their HTML escape sequence (for example,
<b  >&lt;</b> becomes <b  >&lt;</b>).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1c13de8"></a>Database Queries</h2></div></div><p>Now we are going to look at more &ldquo;real life&rdquo; scripts that
could be used in an Intranet application.</p><p>We are going to use PostGres95. It must be installed and
configured properly. I won't explain that process here, since it
would require a lot of additional text. But two things should be
mentioned:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The &ldquo;user&rdquo; which is used when a CGI script is run
on your system must have access to PostGres95, and to the database
being queried.</p></li><li><p>The <b  >connect()</b> function used in
the following scripts may need to be adapted to work on your
system. Mine doesn't need any parameters, since everything works
with the default settings I've configured.</p></li></ol></div><p>See the PostGres95 manual for more information.</p><p>The PyGres95 modules offer the same interface as the LIBPQ
API, which is also described in the PostGres95 manual. You should
know that there is a <b  >connect()</b> function used to
connect to the database, and a <b  >query()</b> function
that receives an SQL string as a parameter.</p><p><a href="1368l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a> shows a script
that will handle queries on a customer database which has a
structure similar to what the fields might be in a query form. The
script will connect to the database, build an SQL command, query
the database, and finally, display the results in a table that is
built on the fly for each request. Of course the SQL statements
here are very simple, but scripts could be written to do
anything.</p><p>This script is not very practical. We'd have to write
specific code for every table we want to use. The script of
<a href="1368l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9</a> implements a general
query on any single PostGres95 table/view from an HTML form. This
means that it will work for any query where you need a subset of a
table. It could work for customers (as in our example), providers
or articles. The main difference from the former script is the
<b  >build_query()</b> function:</p><p>The script now implements the following behaviour: a query
made on a numeric field will require an exact match, while a query
made on a text field will be considered as ending with a wildcard.
This means that numeric fields are considered to be IDs, and that
it's not possible, for example, to use it to search articles with a
value between $500 and $1,000. But it can be used to search a
personal database for all names beginning with &ldquo;Van&rdquo;.</p><p>Restriction: to determine the type of a field, we'll consider
it numeric if its name ends in &ldquo;num&rdquo;. This is because all data
sent to a CGI script is seen as text. Of course, you could parse
the value to see if it's numeric or not. But it's not always a good
choice. If you want to search for all telephone numbers beginning
with &ldquo;800&rdquo;, our script will look for an exact match if it thinks
it's a numeric field, and it will find nothing. Of course, you can
also completely rewrite the <b  >build_query()</b>
function to fit your needs.</p><p>The script needs to know on which table it should perform the
query. That's why our form contains an invisible field called
<b  >TableName</b>. It must be set to the name of the
desired table.</p><p>The form field names must be the same as the table field
names, because the script uses them to perform the query. But, of
course, the labels displayed on the user input form can be
anything.</p><p>And finally, the script contains several lines that can be
commented or uncommented to enable or disable some debug strings in
the resulting page (e.g., as the query string).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1c146d8"></a>Where to Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>There are several powerful features of Python that weren't
discussed in this article. Python supports exception handling, as
in C++ or Modula-3. This can be useful to trap errors in CGI
scripting. It's even possible to write a script with a function to
send a bug report by e-mail to its author when it detects an
unexpected error. And of course, you can write your own
classes.</p><p>For CGI scripting, although we didn't use them in our sample
scripts, some additional features are available. On the Python home
page, you'll find code to embed the Python interpreter in Apache.
And Apache itself comes with optional modules that interact with
PostGres95. But PostGres95 is not the only database
available&mdash;among others, there is a module for Oracle.</p><p>Now, if you want to try Python, the first thing to do is read
the Python Tutorial (see Documentation and Availability), then
print a copy of the Python Library Reference manual. Then, you
should try to reach simple goals&mdash;like deleting all ~*.tmp files
older than one day, for example.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x180f580.0x1c14890"></a>Finding Python on the Web</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>http://www.python.org/</p></li><li><p>http://www.ora.com/</p></li><li><p>http://www.python.org/python/arwbook.html</p></li><li><p>news:comp.lang.python</p></li><li><p>http://www.ki.net/postgres95/</p></li><li><p>http://zen.via.ecp.fr/via_dvpt/products/pygres.html</p></li></ol></div></div></div>
