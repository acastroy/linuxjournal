old PC I used FIPS to decrease the size of the DOS partition and
then used Linux FDISK to create Linux partitions. Windows 95 uses
VFAT. Do you know of a utility or product like FIPS I could use to
decrease the size of the VFAT partition without deleting and adding
new partitions?  &mdash;Lanny Lampl</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d41e8"></a>Partition Magic</h2></div></div><p>There is a fairly inexpensive commercial product called
Partition Magic by PowerQuest
(<b  >http://www.powerquest.com</b>). It is a very nice
and easy to use program which will change the size of your
partition without destroying the data. Of course, you must have
sufficient disk space on the drive you want to resize but it is
very painless. Another nice feature is that it can &ldquo;see&rdquo; Linux
partitions as well (it can't manipulate these partitions but will
at least let you see the sizes).</p><p>One problem with the current version is that you must do the
actual manipulation from DOS (version 7.0 if you have Windows 95).
You can see your partition information from Windows 95 but it will
not allow you to make changes.  &mdash;Douglas Stoun

masquerading and my return e-mail address is properly
emorr@fast.net. After setting up tin for NNTP I can read articles
without trouble but I cannot post. I get a returncode of
<b  >441, post rejected</b>. Didn't my setting up of
sendmail for the correct masquerade work for NNTP, or are my posts
&ldquo;sent differently&rdquo; than mail?  &mdash;Edward W. Morris, Jr</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d4500"></a>Post Rejected?</h2></div></div><p>News posts are indeed &ldquo;sent differently&rdquo;. Sendmail runs on
port 25, NNTP on port 119. You will need to masquerade both ports,
which you must have done if you can read news from masqueraded
machines.</p><p>If you are getting <b  >post rejected</b>, it could
be because the news server is not set up to allow you to post. Can
you post news from your gateway machine? If not, you will need to
talk with whoever administers the news server.  &mdash;Bob Hauck,

Kernel 1.2.13 as our Mailserver. We are using WinPmail as our mail
clients in Novell Netware mode and all users have direct POP3/SMTP
connection to the Linux machine to retrieve and send Internet mail.
The problem is: When the POP3 access is made from the workstations,
the Linux machine responds very slowly, meaning it takes more than
3 minutes to establish the connection. What causes this problem and
how can it be solved?  &mdash;MadavaneShuttle Technology</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d47c0"></a>Three Possible Causes</h2></div></div><p>There are a couple of possibilities. One is that you are
using TCP wrappers in &ldquo;paranoid mode&rdquo; and the reverse lookup for
the workstations is failing because there is no
<b  >in-addr.arpa</b> entry for them in your DNS. If this
is the case, you should be seeing error messages in your syslog
(usually <b  >/var/log/messages</b>).</p><p>You can turn off reverse lookups by removing
<b  >paranoid</b> from your
<b  >/etc/hosts.allow</b> and
<b  >/etc/hosts.deny</b>. That will cause most recent
versions of TCP wrapper to still log the access, but with only the
IP address and not the hostname. Many popular Linux distributions
come with TCP wrappers installed and reverse lookup enabled.</p><p>Another possibility is that you have enough clients that 32MB
is not sufficent. Some POP servers buffer the mailboxes in RAM
while downloading, which uses a lot of RAM if your users are keen
on MIME attachments. You should be able to diagnose this with
<b  >free</b> and <b  >top</b> to see if you
are swapping heavily when the slowdown occurs. The fix would be
more RAM or a different POP server.</p><p>Yet another possibility is that your mail transport
(sendmail, smail, etc) and your POP server are not agreeing on
locking protocols. This can be fixed by recompiling one or the
other. This one is unlikely if you are using the default servers
from one of the major distributions.  &mdash;Bob Hauck,

upgrade to ELF support with 1.2.13 kernel. When I compiled the
kernel with that option set it still wouldn't execute the ELF
binary. What should I do?  &mdash;Patrick Temple</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d4d40"></a>ELF Upgrade Tips</h2></div></div><p>Chances are that you did not install the ELF libraries that
you need in order to execute ELF programs. Your library files must
match those of your executables.</p><p>Many Linux distributions include both sets of libraries to
allow users to use either set of executables, especially since many
existing programs have not been recompiled as ELF binaries yet.
This can be convenient to use, but difficult to duplicate,
especially without knowing your exact system setup at this
point.</p><p>You could be headed for trouble if you try to update your
system libraries to support ELF binaries. Since your system is
currently completely a.out, some of your binaries will stop working
if you don't install the new libraries correctly, and you end up
removing your old ones. If you really want to do this, there is a
file called <b  >move_to_elf</b> in the
<b  >GCC</b> directory of your favorite Sunsite mirror.
This file describes what you need and what you must do to upgrade
to ELF from an a.out system.</p><p>If you feel nervous about changing your system library files,
you might consider simply installing the newest version of
Slackware and restoring your original configuration from it. You
can generally get a CD of Slackware 3.x for next to nothing, and
you will get not only one of the most recent stable kernels (2.0.x)
but your system will be ELF-based. Also, the new Slackware
distributions come with a working ELF/a.out mixed set of libraries,
which will eliminate your worries if you want support for
both.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brttech.comBRT Technical Services

this my performance and available memory have dropped
significantly. I have only 8MB of RAM and a 16MB swap partition.
Everything but the essential modules is handled by kerneld. Why has
my memory useage gone up so drastically? Is there anything to fix
this?  &mdash;Mr. Shannon Spurling</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d5108"></a>Streamlining To Save RAM</h2></div></div><p>In general, performance will be much better with the 2.0.x
kernels than with the 1.2.x kernels. One possible answer to your
problem may be your use of kerneld. That does add some overhead.
Also, loading drivers as modules does use up some additional RAM.
You are better off compiling drivers into the kernel if you use
them most of the time. You are also better off (especially in a low
memory situation) if you can avoid using kerneld entirely.  &mdash;Steven

only way to fix the problem is to install more memory. With 16MB or
more you will have a better performance than with 1.2.x!  &mdash;Klaus

<b  >cannot load libncurses.so.3.0</b>. So I downloaded
the only package I could find that had &ldquo;ncurses&rdquo; in the

tell me how to fix this?  &mdash;Samuel Greeley</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc580.0x25d5478"></a>Establishing a Symbolic Link</h2></div></div><p>Here are some possible answers. First of all,
<b  >libncurses.so.3.0</b> should be a symbolic link to
<b  >libncurses.so.1.9.9e</b>, so make sure the symbolic
link is there. You may need to do an <b  >ldconfig</b> if
you change anything with your libraries. Another possible problem
might be if your xterm is a.out and your libncurses.so is ELF or
vice versa. You can check that by running file on the files (i.e.
<b  >file /usr/X11/bin/xterm</b>), which should tell you
whether your xterm binary and your libncurses.so is a.out or ELF.
They have to match or xterm won't run.  &mdash;Steven Pritchard,
