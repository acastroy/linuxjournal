    The NES boxes use a

    classified packet network, and decrypt it on the other side,
    where it gets routed onto the DDN and evetually onto the Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1572580.0x166a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'm a U.S. Army officer stationed in
Darmstadt, Germany and forward deployed to the former Yugoslavia.
Soon after coming to Europe in 1994 I discovered the &ldquo;Linux
Revolution&rdquo; and have looked for innovative uses ever since. My
first opportunity was with my unit in Darmstadt: I converted an
unused 80386 machine with 8MB of RAM and a 120MB hard drive into a
router/mailer/WWW server. Its primary purpose was to route packets
between the 10Mb/s Ethernet and a 19.2 kb/s SLIP link into a DDN
termserver. In the 20 months since it came on-line, it has never
failed to provide reliable routing and dependable e-mail service.
</p><p>When the US Army deployed to Bosnia as part of the
Implementation Force, we brought with us a complex, impractical
data lifeline. The backbone of Army tactical communications is a
system called Mobile Subscriber Equipment. It provides between 13
and 58 secure, encrypted digital voice trunks and 16-64KB of
encrypted data trunks. Every headquarters has a communications
shelter outside with a BBN T/20 packet switch that routes TCP/IP
traffic onto an X.25 packet switch network, effectively creating a
giant, secure Class B network spanning all of Northern
Bosnia.</p><p>The unsecured, unclassified portion of the network is
provided by Motorola Network Encryption System (NES) boxes
scattered throughout the theater. The NES boxes use a firefly
algorithm to encrypt unclassified data, pass it over the classified
packet network, and decrypt it on the other side, where it gets
routed onto the DDN and evetually onto the Internet.</p><p>The plus side of this arrangement is Internet access to the
soldiers in Bosnia. Originally, we intended to use the system to
pass logistical and other non-sensitive data to the supporting
elements in the rear, but it provided a way to pass non-sensitive
data and morale e-mail as well. The pipelines are small, and the
amount of data forced down them is huge, but it has proved to be an
effective, if unwieldy system.</p><p>As the signal officer for one of the twelve US Brigades in
Bosnia, I am responsible for the care and feeding of approximately
100 desktop and laptop computers, all running Windows for
Workgroups with the Microsoft TCP/IP stack. The physical layout of
the network at our Brigade Headquarters is quite tenuous: two 250m
10Base2 segments with 30 computers on one and 6 on the other,
joined by an Ethernet repeater. In the rough and tumble military
world, it's almost a full-time job keeping the cable and all
connectors together, dry, and passing data.</p><p>The Linux solution stems from the need for a centralized SMTP
gateway and information warehouse. The machine is a Pentium 166
sitting on an Intel Atlantis motherboard, with 512KB of cache and
64MB of RAM, with just under 2GB of storage. I'm running kernel
version 1.3.100, completely ELF and modularized.</p><p>Before I came on the unit, Pegasus mail (a free POP3-based
mail client for MS Windows) was used to retrieve mail from various
e-mail hosts in Germany. Because of the low bandwidth, users were
waiting 5-10 minutes to download just a few messages, and users'
mail was &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; on the computer used to retrieve
messages.</p><p>My solution involved the Samba package coupled with the
security built in to Windows for Workgroups. I used Samba to export
the /home directory of the server, and created user accounts for
everyone. The Pegasus mail executables and library files were put
in the /home directory with 640 permission flags and root:users as
the owner:group. Windows users were then instructed to attach (in
Windows parlance) the \\MAILSERV\MAIL share as their M: drive. The
Pegasus initialization file required that I use a static drive
label (M:, for mail) The user then created an icon in Windows
pointing to the M:\WINPMAIL.EXE file.</p><p>Adding users was tedious until I broke down and wrote a Perl
script to create the entry in /etc/passwd and personalize a generic
PMAIL.INI file that was copied over from the /etc/skel
directory.</p><p>The result is a secure, seamless e-mail server that allows
users to log in using the familiar WfW login prompt and run a
common e-mail client from any PC on the network. Pegasus uses POP3
to download mail from the Linux box, then stores the mail on the
Linux box in the user's home directory. Outgoing mail is sent to
the Linux machine for delivery; unreliable links and slow network
response made it too easy for a user to leave mail stuck in the
outbound queue when he shut down the e-mail client.</p><p>One additional advantage of the Linux box on my network is
that I can run my own name server. I began with Nicolai Langfeldt's
caching named mini-howto and set all my Windows clients to point to
the Linux machine as a primary DNS. I discovered that a significant
chunk of my bandwidth was disapearing due to net surfers. I tried
to limit the number of browsers my users had, but I found it was
easier to send the browsers bogus IP addresses for certain
&ldquo;unsavory&rdquo; sites that shouldn't be visited with a government
computer. I told my named to return the IP of the Linux machine,
and created a web page to scold my serious offenders. Everyone got
a chuckle out of it, and I got my bandwidth back to a usable
level.</p><p>I have also been able to provide a whois server for a sizable
chunk of the deployed soldiers with e-mail accounts, and an
intranet web site with photos and info pertinent to the
command.</p><p>The Samba programming team has put together an excellent
package that allows me to cater to the users' demand for a Windows
operating system without tying me to the propriatary e-mail and
server programs of Windows NT. I look forward to future releases of
Samba that will include domain services and validation, and I'm
always on the lookout for new ideas and applications for
Linux.</p></div></div>
