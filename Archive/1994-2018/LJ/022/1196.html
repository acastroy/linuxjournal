    A discussion of the use of e-mail filters on Unix computers
    that use Sendmail-like mail systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141a500"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have heard it said that electronic mail
is the biggest reason that people first go to the Internet, and
that Usenet news is why they stay. My question is, what is the
single biggest reason that people leave the Internet? The answer is
junk mail! Well, maybe they haven't left. It just looks that way
because they <span   class="bold"><b>never</b></span> answer e-mail.
It's easy to understand why in a public forum that spans the globe
and includes tens of millions of members, people might be receiving
more mail than they can read.
</p><p>There are thousands of opportunities to subscribe to mailing
lists, and interneters can quickly overfill their plates. I know,
I've done it. In this article I'll discuss a powerful set of tools
that allow you to get control of your in-box and reduce your
chances of heart trouble related to starting your mail reader.
These tools are called &ldquo;E-mail filters&rdquo;. E-mail filters are
programs that sort mail based on a your directions. For instance;
all mail from my brother should be moved from my in-box mail folder
to a folder labeled &ldquo;Frank&rdquo;. Filters work by processing mail,
after the system delivers the mail to you, but before you actually
read it.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141a710"></a>How an e-mail Transaction Works</h2></div></div><p>Let's start at the point that mail for you is delivered. When
mail is delivered to your computer on the Internet, it arrives via
a mail system which is using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
Although there is probably a different e-mail daemon for every week
of the year, <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> is by far
the most popular. For the rest of this article when I speak of the
&ldquo;mail system&rdquo; I'll just call it sendmail, though most of what I
say applies with smail, MMDF, and others. You can ignore the
differences for the purposes of this article.</p><p>So, to continue, &ldquo;sendmail&rdquo; takes the e-mail and then
decides whether the e-mail needs to be sent directly on to another
system or delivered locally. If sendmail decides that the mail
should be delivered locally, it goes through a short list of
actions. First it looks to see if there is a .forward file in the
user's home directory. If there is no .forward file, sendmail
writes the mail to the user's system-wide mail file.</p><p>If the user does have a .forward file, sendmail reads the
file. If the file contains an e-mail address, sendmail fowards the
message to that address. If the forward file contains a pipe
<b  >|</b> character, sendmail runs the specified
program, sending it the mail message, letting the program deliver
the mail. This last case is how e-mail filters work. The sendmail
daemon &ldquo;delivers&rdquo; the mail to your filter, and the filter
delivers it (or doesn't deliver it, if you prefer) to the folders,
following your set of rules. If you use the elm filter program,
your .forward file might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"| /usr/local/bin/filter"
</pre><p>sendmail would deliver all your mail to the program called
filter.</p><p>What would happen if filter was not there, or otherwise
broken? We can guard against failure, by providing an alternative
for sendmail.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"| /usr/local/bin/filter || exit 75 "
</pre><p>In this example, if the filter fails, the delivery to the
user's .forward file will exit with an error number 75. This forces
sendmail to back off the .forward file, and try again later
instead. The <b  >|| exit 75</b> only protects against
catastrophe, not bad choices. If you do not correctly configure
your filter, it may lose mail, but would not &ldquo;fail&rdquo; from the
perspective of sendmail. The <b  >exit 75</b> would not
help you to get the mail back.</p><p>The most common place the <b  >exit 75</b> can help
you is when your home directory runs out of space. Most filters
will gracefully fail, allowing your mail to be delivered to the
system mailbox instead. This is especially helpful on systems that
have disk quotas on the home directories, because the mail spool
generally does not have user quotas.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141ac90"></a>Choosing a Mail Filter</h2></div></div><p>There are at least four popular mail filters available:
<a href="1196s5.html" target="_self">Procmail</a>,
<a href="1196s2.html" target="_self">Elm-filter</a>,
<a href="1196s4.html" target="_self">Mailagent</a>, and MH's slocal.
Procmail is a robust general purpose mail filter. By design, it is
small, easy to install, and dependable. Elm is a user mail program
for reading and sending e-mail. The Elm-filter is a separate
program that comes with the Elm package, and can be used with or
without the rest of Elm. Slocal is the mail agent that comes with
the Rand corporation's Mail Handler (MH). You might be buying the
Cadillac for the cigarette lighter if you install MH just to use
slocal, though. Unfortunately, Slocal does not support regular
expressions (see <a href="1196s6.html" target="_self">msort sidebar</a> for
a possible solution). In contrast to Slocal, the mail filtering
package called &ldquo;Mailagent&rdquo; supports a very rich regular
expression syntax. Unlike the other filters which are written in C,
mailagent is written primarily in Perl, and uses Perl's powerful
regular expressions.</p><p>Procmail can write mail to &ldquo;mbox&rdquo; style mail files, as well
as MH style mail directories. Slocal can write to &ldquo;mbox&rdquo; style
mail files, as well as its native MH style &ldquo;folders&rdquo;
(directories). In general, mail agents can be used interchangably
with many different e-mail readers.</p><p>I use procmail to filter my mail, MH for my mail package, and
&ldquo;Exmh&rdquo; as an X-based frontend to MH. (Exmh is written in Tcl/Tk,
and is possibly the <span   class="bold"><b>best</b></span> way to do
e-mail. [I agree!---ED])</p><p>If you are lucky, one or more of the e-mail filters described
here may already be installed on your system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141b058"></a>Filter Installation</h2></div></div><p>If you are not so lucky, you may need to install an e-mail
filter. These filter programs have a varying degree of ease for
installation. They all can be installed without root privileges,
but save yourself some trouble, and ask your system administrator
to install it for general use. If you are handy with a compiler,
offer to help out. If you have to do it yourself, you'll need to
get the sources, compile them, and create any needed configuration
files. See the sidebar &ldquo;Where to get a mail filter&rdquo; for more
information on getting and installing the common e-mail
filters.</p><p>Spend some time figuring out your needs for mail file
locking. Locking is used to guarantee that sendmail does not try to
write to a file at the same time you do. The documentation for each
of these packages mentions this subject, so pay attention. I found
out the hard way that my mail reader was using one type of lock
while my filter was using another (a moment of silence for all my
lost mail, please).</p><p>After you either install a mail filter (or locate it, if it's
already installed) you will need to start pushing your mail through
it. As in the example above, most e-mail filters can be invoked
using the .forward file. If your system does not support this
feature, you can still use e-mail filters, but you may need to
periodically invoke the filter using a script. You can run your
script every time you login, or once each time you read mail, or
use cron to run it on a regular basis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141b210"></a>How a Filter Works</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a way to get e-mail pumped into our filter,
let's talk about what happens next. What does the filter
<span   class="bold"><b>do</b></span> with your mail? To start with,
&ldquo;E-mail filters&rdquo; might be more appropriately labeled &ldquo;e-mail
sorters&rdquo;. We all have &ldquo;filters&rdquo; in our kitchen: flour sifters
are used to filter based on size, strainers let liquids through but
not the pasta, and coffee filters let the good stuff through
leaving behind the brown sludge.</p><p>Most people are not satisfied with filtering e-mail based on
size, color, or fluid state. They would prefer to sort their mail
based on: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Where it's from</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Who it's
from</em></span>, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>What it's about</em></span>. In
e-mail terms, this might be done by looking at the
<b  >From:</b> or <b  >Subject:</b> lines.
Instead of &ldquo;filter&rdquo; we might do better to talk about an
&ldquo;agent&rdquo;, &ldquo;secretary&rdquo;, &ldquo;processor&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;e-mail dog&rdquo;. We
can give instructions to &ldquo;an agent&rdquo;, but not a coffee pot.</p><p>With that in mind, we can create a set of rules for our
&ldquo;filter&rdquo; to follow. If an e-mail message matches on a rule, an
action is taken. Procmail and Slocal can have only one action per
rule, although there are a few ways to get around that limit.
Unless otherwise directed, filtering stops after a match, and the
action completes, making the order of rules important. Keep the
most specific rules at the top (first), and the default case (what
happens if no rules match) at the bottom. Let's look at a few
examples:</p><p>Using the procmail program, we can create a file in our home
directory called .procmailrc. Procmail calls its filtering
directions &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;. Simple recipes look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0
* ^From.*jay@fork.com
forkmail
:0
* ^From.*cory
* ^Subject.*Elvis
/dev/null
</pre><p>The first recipe tells procmail to look for mail that
contains a line starting with the the word <b  >From</b>,
and contains the string <b  >jay@fork.com</b>. If
procmail finds a match for this description, it stores the e-mail
message in the file forkmail. The second recipe matches on two
criteria; Email from <b  >cory</b>, with a subject that
includes the word <b  >Elvis</b>, is deleted. The matches
are based on regular expression syntax of egrep.</p><p>The equivalent using Elm's filter ($HOME/.elm/filter-rules)
would look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (from contains "jay@fork.com")  ?
        save "~/mail/forkmail"
if (from contains "cory" and subject = "Elvis") then
        delete
</pre><p>Elm's filter calls these stanzas &ldquo;rules&rdquo;. The matches are
&ldquo;egrep like&rdquo;, but not as fully-featured as the matching you can
get using procmail.</p><p>In slocal's .maildelivery file our rules would look
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# header pattern action result string
# lines starting with a " are ignored,
# as are blank lines
&gt;From jay@fork.com ^ "/pkgs/mh/lib/rcvstore +inbox"
&gt;From cory         file R /dev/null
Subject Elvis     destroy N -
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x141b9f8"></a>General Strategies for Filters</h2></div></div><p>When constructing filter rules, err on the side of caution.
Try constructing a few simple rules first. Test the rules by
sending mail to yourself, and further test by leaving the filter in
place for a few days. If it all works, you can start to add more
complex rules. Make sure you have the &ldquo;default&rdquo; behavior of your
filter set. Learn how to turn on debugging, and then to turn it
off. Try out the logging functions. Using procmail's &ldquo;mailstat&rdquo;,
you can get a summary of what actions procmail has taken. By
investing a bit of time in figuring out how to make your filter
work, you'll reap manifold time savings later.</p><p>While you are learning how to use your filter, you may want
to keep a backup mail file. Instead of using one line in your
.forward file which invokes your filter, you might want two
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
"| <span   class="emphasis"><em>/path/to/filter</em></span>"
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>username</tt></i></b>
is your login. This way, your mail will all be delivered to your
standard system mailbox as well as through your mail filter. If you
have misconfigured your mail filter, you will have a backup to
retrieve your mail from. There are several other ways to do this,
as well.</p><p>I find that people tend towards two schemes when building
mail filters. The first technique is to sort out mail based
primarily on who it is from. The second is to filter based on
content or function. Mail from my manager could go in a folder
called <b  >boss</b>, but I get a lot of mail from him
that's not particularly important, not because it's from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>him</em></span>, but because of what it's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>about</em></span>. For instance, mail from my manager with
a subject of &ldquo;Hardware budget for next year&rdquo;, would better go
into my &ldquo;budgets&rdquo; folder than my &ldquo;boss&rdquo; folder.</p><p>If you are not particularly worried about disk space, why not
try both? Filter all the e-mail based on who it's from
<span   class="bold"><b>and</b></span> on other factors like key
words in the Subject line or other headers. In my case, my filter
could save a copy of all mail I get from my boss in the folder
called &ldquo;boss&rdquo;, and store all e-mail with a subject line that
contains the word &ldquo;budget&rdquo; in the folder called
&ldquo;budgets&rdquo;.</p><p>A side effect of using filters is the excellent tracking
you'll get of your e-mail. By using the logging and reporting that
comes with Mailagent, Elm-filter, and Procmail, you will learn a
lot about your e-mail. How much mail do you get from the
&ldquo;Elvis-lifestyles&rdquo; mailing list? What percent of the mail is it?
How does it compare to the amount of mail you get from your
brother? I use the mailstat program to gauge how much time I spend
supporting different departments' computers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1322580.0x1412860"></a>More Advanced Rules</h2></div></div><p>PGP key handling has a special need. People who use Phil
Zimmerman's PGP program to send encrypted e-mail need to exchange
&ldquo;public keys&rdquo; to communicate securely. A common convention is to
put the public portion of the PGP key in the .plan file. Anyone who
wants the key can then just finger you. This is great, unless your
system does not support finger, or your account is behind a
firewall. The next best thing might be some sort of automatic mail
response. Using procmail, you can filter for a special phrase in
the subject line, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 h c
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* ^Subject.*SEND-PGP-KEY
| (formail -r -A"Precedence: junk";\
   cat ~/.plan ) | $SENDMAIL -t

</pre><p>This procmail recipe first checks to see if the mail comes
from the mail daemon, to prevent e-mail loops, or &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;. Then
if the subject includes the special phrase
<b  >SEND-PGP-KEY</b>, procmail invokes formail which
automatically constructs a reply to the sender. The e-mail that is
sent back includes the contents of the .plan file. If you keep your
PGP public key in this file, anybody can request a copy of your
key, even if they can't finger you. The equivalent using Elm-filter
would look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ( subject contains "SEND-PGP-KEY" ) then
  execute "cat ~/.plan | mail -s \"RE: %s\" %r"
</pre><p>Elm's filter uses a macro <b  >%s</b> to represent
the original subject of the message, and <b  >%r</b> to
represent the return address.</p><p>Mail agents are really great if you have special e-mail
needs. I carry an alphanumeric pager. I use procmail to watch for
mail that has the magic word <b  >PAGEJAY</b> in the
subject line. If procmail sees the magic word two things happen.
First, a copy of the e-mail is forwarded to my e-mail-&gt;pager
gateway at page-jay@pager.fork.com. When the forwarded message gets
through the gateway, it will be broadcast to my pager. (The folks
in my office call this &ldquo;Belt-Mail&rdquo;, or if the pager is set to
vibrate, it's an e-mail massage.) Second, a copy of the e-mail is
stored in a local folder called &ldquo;pages&rdquo;. Here is what the
procmail recipe looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 c
* ^Subject.*PAGEJAY
! page-jay@pager.fork.com
:0
* ^Subject.*PAGEJAY
pages/.
</pre><p>The first recipe uses the <b  >c</b> flag. This
tells procmail that even if there is a match, the matching should
<b  >c</b>ontinue past. In the next recipe, the belt-mail
will get filed, and the matching of this e-mail will end. The
equivalent in Elm's-filter rules would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ( subject contains "PAGEJAY") then
      forward "page-jay@pager.fork.com"
      save "~Mail/pages"
endif
</pre><p>E-mail filters/agents are powerful tools that enable people
who get lots of e-mail to communicate effectively. From the mundane
but important task of sorting e-mail, to the complex task of
responding automatically to e-mail requests, filters can deliver.
Everyone involved benefits from the use of filters. You like it
because your mail is always sorted the same way
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Where</em></span> did I put that CERT advisory?). The
people who send e-mail to you like it because you start to respond
faster by e-mail than via Canadian &ldquo;First Class&rdquo;. The only people
who don't like it are the direct-marketing-spamers who keep trying
to send you ads for &ldquo;Investment opportunities&rdquo;. It's OK if they
get mad, because you don't ever see their mail since you installed
the filter.</p><p>Any time spent learning how to configure and use the filters
is won back many-fold in time-savings later.</p><p>For more information about e-mail filters, see
