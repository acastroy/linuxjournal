    Want to start backing up your Linux system properly, but
    don't know what's available to do the job? Yusuf Nagree
    helps you configure and use available backup hardware.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc83f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are currently three main types of
tape drives available for the PC (and hence Linux). There are those
based on SCSI interfaces, those based on the floppy drive interface
(QIC-40, QIC-80, QIC-117, QIC-3010 and QIC-3020), and QIC-02 type
drives. A new breed of tape drives that attach to the IDE interface
is coming, but at the moment, Linux support is minimal. There is no
Linux support for drives that attach to the parallel port.
</p><p>You cannot simply attach a tape drive to your machine and
expect Linux to automatically recognize it. You need to tell the
kernel about it, and this can involve recompiling the kernel. In
addition, you need entries in your /dev directory so that programs
under Linux can access the tape drives.</p><p>Below, I will describe how to set up the two most common
types of tape drives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc85b0"></a>Floppy Interface Tape Drives</h2></div></div><p>Tape drives that connect to the floppy drive interface have
the advantage that no separate interface card is required; they
are, therefore, fairly cheap and reliable. Thus, this breed of tape
drive has been very popular.</p><p>One of the first tape drives of this type was the Colorado
Jumbo 250. The tape drive cable for these drives attaches to the
floppy drive interface. The QIC-80 specification defines how to
access these tape drives. Many other tape drives, including the
Iomega 250, Conner C250MQ, Wangtek 304, and Colorado Jumbo 350 are
QIC-80 compatible.</p><p>Tape drives that use the QIC-80 specification require a
program (actually, a &ldquo;Loadable Kernel Module&rdquo;) called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ftape</em></span>, written by Bas Laarhoven and Kai
Harrekilde-Petersen, which at the time of writing is at version
2.03b. QIC-117 and QIC-40 formats are also supported by ftape, as
is QIC-3010 and QIC-3020 (i.e. QIC-WIDE) in an experimental form. A
complete list of tape drives supported by ftape can be found in the
vndors.h file in the ftape source distribution. Support for some
enhanced controller boards is also provided&mdash;specifically Iomega
Tape Accelerator, Colorado FC-10, and Mountain MACH-2. Support for
the FC-15 and FC-20 high speed Colorado controller boards is not
yet provided.</p><p>Most Linux distributions include ftape; if yours doesn't, you
will have to download it (see
<a href="1215s1.html" target="_self"><span   class="emphasis"><em>Tape Resources</em></span>
sidebar</a>). Unless you are using module version support in
your kernel (if you don't understand what this means, you can
assume that you are not using it), ftape will need to be recompiled
each time you update your kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc88c8"></a>Compiling ftape</h2></div></div><p>First, go to your source directory and unpack the
sources:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:$ cd /usr/local/src
$ tar xzf ftape-2.03b.tar.gz
</pre><p>You will end up with a directory ftape-2.03b; all the ftape
source files will be in this directory along with some
documentation files. You now need to compile ftape to end up with a
file ftape.o:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ftape-2.03b
$ make clean
$ make dep
$ make all
</pre><p>Next, you need to make sure that your kernel has been
compiled with ftape support built in. Recompiling the kernel is
beyond the scope of this article (see the Kernel-HOWTO more
details), but basically, do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ make config
</pre><p>to accept all the default values for all options (unless, of
course, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to change them), and when
you get to the QIC-117 option, answer <b  >Y</b>. Leave
the <b  >NR_FTAPE_BUFFERS</b> at the default value of 3.
Then recompile the kernel (usually <b  >make clean dep; make
zImage</b>) and install the new kernel. Don't forget to
re-run lilo if you use it.</p><p>If you are using very recent kernels (1.3.30 and above), you
will have to use <b  >zftape</b>. zftape (written by
Claus Heine) is based on ftape but provides support for the
dynamically loaded buffers provided by the later kernels. You
compile it exactly the same way as ftape. Installing it is also
done the same way as with ftape, except that you will use the name
zftape instead of ftape. When configuring your kernel, you will not
get asked any questions about QIC-117 options or
<b  >NR_FTAPE_BUFFERS</b>.</p><p>Even if you are not using recent kernels, zftape provides
some very good enhancements over the basic ftape package, including
software compression, and it is well worthwhile upgrading to get
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc8ea0"></a>Making The Devices</h2></div></div><p>Next, you need to make sure that the /dev entries have been
created correctly for ftape. Once again, if you have a Linux
distribution, this will more than likely have been done, otherwise;
you will have to create them manually. Do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /dev/*rft* /dev/*tape*
</pre><p>and you should have at least the following files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/rft0
/dev/nrft0
/dev/ftape
/dev/nftape
</pre><p>If you do not, create them (you will have to be root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/rft0 c 27 0
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/nrft0 c 27 4
$ ln -s /dev/rft0 /dev/ftape
$ ln -s /dev/nrft0 /dev/nftape
</pre><p>Alternatively, if you have a script called MAKEDEV in your
/dev/ directory, you can simply run this to have your devices
created correctly.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /dev
$ ./MAKEDEV ftape
</pre><p>If you are using the zftape package, there are certain other
device names that you will require. They can be created from the
zftape Makefile by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ make mknod
$ ln -s /dev/rft0 /dev/ftape
$ ln -s /dev/nrft0 /dev/nftape
$ ln -s /dev/qft0 /dev/qftape
$ ln -s /dev/nqft0 /dev/nqftape
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc92c0"></a>Installing ftape</h2></div></div><p>You next need to make sure that you have the module
utilities. This set of utilities allows the ftape driver to be
loaded so that the kernel can access it. You will need the program
<b  >insmod</b> which should be in /sbin. If you do not
have it, obtain the latest version (see
<a href="1215s1.html" target="_self"><b  >Tape
Resources</b></a>), compile it (which is quite easy), and
install it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xzf modules-xx.xx.tar.gz
$ cd modules-xx.xx
$ make clean
$ make
$ make install
</pre><p>Note that if you are using modules-1.1.87, you must replace
insmod.c and insmod.h with the ones that come in the ftape
distribution. To avoid these problems, obtain a copy of the latest
modules, which contains many other bug fixes as well.</p><p>Before you can use the tape drive, you must load the ftape
program. You will have to be root to do so.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ insmod ftape.o
</pre><p>This must be done every time you boot up Linux. If you do a
lot of tape drive work, it is a good idea to include this in your
rc.local startup script so that every time you boot up the tape
driver is automatically loaded.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc9688"></a>Tape Preparation</h2></div></div><p>There are two steps to using a new tape with Linux. The tape
must be low-level formatted. You can actually buy pre-formatted
tapes (and they are only a couple of extra dollars and well worth
the money), but if you have bought an unformatted tape, you will
have to format it yourself. There is no Linux program available to
format tapes, so this must be done under DOS, OS/2 or WINDOWS. DOS
programs known to format tapes correctly include Norton Backup,
Colorado Systems Backup Program (shipped with Jumbo drives), and
Conner Backup Basics.</p><p>Next, the tape has to be prepared for use by ftape which has
to write headers and sector maps. You can use <b  >mt</b>
do this preparation (which is known as erasing a tape).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mt -f /dev/ftape erase
</pre><p>mt comes as part of the cpio package from GNU. See below for
locations.</p><p>If you are using zftape, your device name is /dev/qftape and
hence, you need to issue:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mt -f /dev/qftape erase
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc99a0"></a>Common Problems</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>PCI motherboards</b></span>
Some PCI motherboards have problems using ftape. The difficulty
seems to lie with the Guaranteed Access Timing (GAT) option in the
BIOS. This option must be disabled for ftape to work correctly.
Note that some of the later Intel boards (1.00.10AX1 and later)
have this setting permanently disabled.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>insmod says &ldquo;wrong kernel
version&rdquo;</b></span> As mentioned above, ftape will only work with
the kernel that was running when it was compiled. Each time you
change kernel versions, you will need to recompile ftape.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Unable to use floppy
disk</b></span> Because both the tape drive and the floppy disk use
IRQ 6, it is impossible to concurrently use the tape drive and
floppy disk drive. Therefore, if you try to use the floppy disk
while ftape is installed, you will get an error message. Similarly,
if you try to install ftape while you have a floppy disk mounted,
you will get an error. This is a hardware limitation and has
nothing to do with ftape.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ftape seems to hang after
accessing tape</b></span> Earlier versions of ftape had problems
with retry errors. Updating to the latest ftape (currently v2.03)
usually solves these.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>No such device
error</b></span> When trying to use tar or some other program that
accesses the tape drive, you get a &ldquo;No such device error&rdquo;. This
is because you have not installed the ftape driver using insmod as
described above.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>No such file or
directory</b></span> When trying to use tar or some other program
that accesses the tape drive, you get a No such file or directory
error. This is because you do not have a /dev/ftape and /dev/rft0
entries in your /dev directories. Create them using MAKEDEV or
using the method outlined above.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc2328"></a>SCSI Tape Drives</h2></div></div><p>SCSI tape drives can be difficult (or very easy) to get
working but they are generally quicker, and more reliable, and
there is no problem using floppies and tape drives simultaneously.
The downside is that they are usually much more expensive than
their floppy drive equivalents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc2430"></a>Compiling with SCSI Support</h2></div></div><p>You have to ensure that the kernel you are running has
support enabled for your SCSI adaptor. Change to the kernel
directory and start the kernel configuration script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ make config
</pre><p>Press <b  >ENTER</b> for all the options to accept
the default values, until you come to the question
<b  >CONFIG_SCSI</b>. Type <b  >Y</b> for this
option. Press <b  >ENTER</b> until you come to the
question <b  >CONFIG_CHR_DEV</b> and type
<b  >Y</b> for this option. Continue pressing
<b  >ENTER</b> until you come to your SCSI adaptor and
answer <b  >Y</b> to this question. You then have to
recompile the kernel, as mentioned above.</p><p>When you boot up, you should now get a message similar to
this (the numbers, and details may, of course, vary):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Detected SCSI tape st0 at scsi0 id 4, lun 0
scsi: Detected 1 SCSI tape 1 SCSI disk total
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc2958"></a>Making Devices</h2></div></div><p>Next, you need to make sure that the SCSI devices have been
created in your /dev directory. Once again, if you have a Linux
distribution, this will more than likely have been done. Otherwise,
you will have to create them manually. Do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /dev/*st*
</pre><p>and you should have at least the following files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/st0
/dev/nst0
</pre><p>If you do not, create them (you will have to be root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/st0 c 9 0
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/nst0 c 9 128
</pre><p>Note, the above assumes that you are using the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> tape on the SCSI bus. If you have two
tapes, and you want to use the second one, change the device names
to /dev/st1 and /dev/nst1 and create them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/st1 c 9 1
$ mknod -m 666 /dev/nst1 c 9 129
</pre><p>If you have a more recent distribution, chances are you will
have the MAKEDEV script available in your /dev directory. You can
create all the appropriate devices by simply running that
script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /dev
$ ./MAKEDEV st0
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc2dd0"></a>Tape Preparation</h2></div></div><p>Unlike floppy tape drive tapes, SCSI tapes generally do not
need formatting. They may, however, need erasing for use under
Linux. To erase a tape, do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mt -f /dev/st0 erase
</pre><p>DAT tapes, however, do not need erasing. The easiest way to
find out if a particular tape needs erasing is to try using it
without erasing first. If you can, well and good; if not, you will
have to erase prior to use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc2f88"></a>Device Names</h2></div></div><p>Accessing a tape drive is very similar to accessing a file on
the hard disk, except that a tape drive has two filenames. For
ftape, these two names are generally /dev/ftape and /dev/nftape. If
you use zftape, the two device names are generally /dev/qftape and
/dev/nqftape. For SCSI, the names are /dev/st0 and /dev/nst0 for
the first SCSI tape device, /dev/st1 and /dev/nst1 for the second
SCSI tape device, and so on.</p><p>When the tape drive is accessed by the first filename
(/dev/ftape, /dev/qftape, or /dev/st0), we are said to be accessing
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>rewinding</em></span> device. When the tape drive is
closed, the tape is automatically rewound to the beginning. When
accessing the tape drive via the second filename (/dev/nftape,
/dev/nqftape, or /dev/nst0), we are using the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non-rewinding</em></span> device and when the tape drive
is closed, the tape is left where it is.</p><p>Some applications need to use both devices and you will need
to specify the correct names.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc31f0"></a>Testing Using tar</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have set up your system for a tape drive, you
will want to test it. GNU tar is the de facto backup standard under
Linux and comes will all distributions. If you do not have it,
obtain it from a site near you.</p><p>In the examples below, I will use
<b  ><i><tt>dev_name</tt></i></b> to indicate
your device name. As mentioned above, this will probably be
/dev/ftape if you use ftape, /dev/qftape if you use zftape, and
/dev/st0 if you use a SCSI drive.</p><p>Put a freshly prepared tape into the tape drive and try to
make a small backup:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar cf <span   class="emphasis"><em>dev_name</em></span> /etc
</pre><p>This should backup your /etc directory. You can now check to
see if the backup was made correctly by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar df <span   class="emphasis"><em>dev_name</em></span>
</pre><p>Note that if you use ftape, you cannot use the
<b  >Ar</b> options to tar because of limitations in the
current driver. That is, you cannot append files to an archive. You
will have to use mt to move the tape to the end of one archive and
then create another archive.</p><p>A more detailed look at tar is provided in the
<a href="../022/1216.html" target="_self">Tar and Taper for Linux</a>
article.</p><p>Please note that the above sites are
<span   class="bold"><b>very</b></span> busy. In the interests of
preserving your sanity and minimizing network traffic, find a
mirror (and there are many) near you and use that. Both tsx-11 and
sunsite will print a list of mirrors if you try to log on when they
are busy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1fc3820"></a>Further Information</h2></div></div><p>The HOW-TOs are an invaluable source of information. There is
a HOW-TO for both ftape and for SCSI.</p></div></div>
