  <div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h1 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2107ab0"></a>DECUS conference in San Francisco</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Phil Hughes</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #22, February 1996</div></div><div><p>
    While our booth was the only Linux-specific one, there
    was a lot of Linux interest.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x21082f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our first coverage of a DECUS conference
was in the August 1994 issue where we reported on the May 1994
DECUS conference in New Orleans, at which Linus Torvalds spoke. In
May, 1995, <i  >Linux Journal</i> was represented at
SSC's booth at the Washington DC DECUS '95 conference. That booth
was quite a success so we decided to see how Linux would do at San
Francisco.
</p><p>The trade show ran three days, Monday to Wednesday, December
4th to the 6th, with the whole conference starting on Dec 2 and
continuing through the 7th. DECUS scheduled two four-hour Linux
talks: &ldquo;How to write a Linux Device Driver&rdquo; by Michael K. Johnson
and &ldquo;Linux: The Open System for Everyone&rdquo; presented by me. In
addition, while not part of the formal DECUS show, a special Linux
Daze was scheduled to start on Wednesday afternoon and continue
through Thursday.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x21084a8"></a>The Trade Show</h2></div></div><p>While our booth was the only Linux-specific one, there was a
lot of Linux interest. As at the trade show in DC, we were the most
popular booth in the &ldquo;low-rent&rdquo; district of booths. There were
quite a few people who hadn't heard of Linux, but there were even
more who had and were happy to see <i  >Linux Journal</i> at the show. We gave out over 1000 copies of our
December issue. Not bad for a show with attendance of less than
2500. We also gave out bumper stickers and sold Linux and other SSC
products. Sales of T-shirts and Linux CDs were higher than
expected.</p><p>We were also showing Zebu Systems' Orion Firewall Systems.
Quite a few companies at the show were shopping for firewall
systems. The SSC booth was staffed by an assortment of people with
varying areas of expertise. Carlie Fairchild provided information
on SSC's Linux products and was in charge of the overall booth
operation. Michael K. Johnson and I were both in the booth to
address <i  >Linux Journal</i> questions as well as
general Linux questions, as was Randolph Bentson, the author of the
Cyclades driver software, and author of a soon-to-be-published
Linux book.</p><p>David Bonn and Larry Stelmat of Mazama Software Labs were
also at the booth. David is the president of Mazama which is a
Linux-based software development company in the San Francisco Bay
area and the Puget Sound (Seattle) area; David is the primary
author of the firewall software that runs on the Orion Firewall
System.</p><p>A walk around the trade show and talk with other vendors
showed, once again, more interest in Linux. AT SSC we use the
Progress database. It is currently running on a Unix 5.4.2 xystem
because there is no Linux port available. I did a little Linux
evangelism at the Progress booth and they admitted that there were
other customers asking for a Linux port. If you are a Progress
user, I encourage you to voice your interest in a Linux version.
Seems like they're starting to hear us.</p><p>On Carlie's search for a power cord (you always have to
forget something at trade shows), she met Jan Cherkowski, President
of Advanced Business Technology Inc. Jan is an avid Linux
enthusiast and wants to ship Linux/Alpha solutions. Don't be
surprised if you see his ads in a future issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Another hardware vendor, Polywell, showed similar interest in
reselling Linux/Alpha systems. Because I was wearing a Linux
T-shirt Emmett Kiest-Jones of Magic Software Enterprises Inc. came
running after me to talk to me. Magic offers a RAD (Rapid
Application Development) environment currently available on VMS and
other platforms. Emmett said there was significant interest in
producing a Linux board.</p><p>The people in the booth next to us were the publishers of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital UNIX News</em></span>, a bi-monthly on Unix for
Digital platforms. In their current issue there is an article on
Linux which initially appears to be very favorable, talking about
many of the reasons Linux is a good system. It then ends with a
conclusion that doesn't seem to follow&mdash;that Linux is a
toy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2108920"></a>The Linux Sessions</h2></div></div><p>On Wednesday, there were two Linux sessions as part of the
standard DECUS Program. The first one, &ldquo;Linux: the Unix for
everyone&rdquo;, was my session. While attendance was low (10 students),
interest was high and the talk went very well (if I do say so
myself). The afternoon session was &ldquo;Writing a Linux Device
Driver&rdquo; by Michael K. Johnson. Michael was pleased with the
participation in his session as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2108a28"></a>Linux Daze</h2></div></div><p>Linux Daze officially started with a room of Linux vendors at
noon. The vendors included Caldera, Cyclades, Digital, O'Reilly,
SoftCraft, NekoTech and BVC.</p><p>At 7pm there were two talks on Linux, as part of Linux Daze.
I gave a short talk called &ldquo;Linux in Publishing&rdquo;, and Matt Welsh
spoke on &ldquo;Porting to Linux&rdquo;.</p><p>Thursday, Linux Daze continued with a full day of vendor
exhibits (much better attended than those on Wednesday afternoon)
and a full day of sessions on a variety of Linux topics. The day
was wrapped up with CD-ROM giveaways, and topped off with a drawing
for the grand prize&mdash;a complete Alpha System (Digital's
<span   class="bold"><b>Universal Desktop Box</b></span>) donated by
NekoTech.</p><p>DECUS was a success for Linux. While attendance was low,
Linux interest seemed high. Some scheduling problems and lack of
communication and promotion of the Linux events seemed to have
resulted in the loss of a few attendees but I expect interest in
Linux to remain high in the Digital community. Now on to the Feb
26-March 1 DECUS in Vancouver, BC to see how Linux does
there.</p></div></div>
