    Last month's installment covered many aspects of password
    protection. This month's installment goes on to explain
    several other aspects of system security.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d6580.0x15ce450"></a>File-system Protection</h2></div></div><p>Besides password protection, file ownerships and protection
modes are the other major component of traditional UNIX security.
Although far from a perfect solution, a carefully set up and
maintained file-system will provide a great deal of protection from
harm in the event that a non-root account is compromised.
File-system security includes these considerations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Correct ownerships and protections for system
files: command binaries, shared libraries, and so on. Such files
generally should be owned by root or another system user like bin
and by a system group such as system or bin. They should not be
group, or world, writable. Some files, such as the shadow password
file, should be restricted to owner access only.</p></li><li><p>The same considerations apply to the directories
where system files are stored. Keep in mind that write access to a
directory allows you to modify any file within it regardless of the
ownership or protections of the individual file (although SETGID
access on a directory restricts users' access to their own files,
as for /tmp).</p></li><li><p>SETUID and SETGID files deserve special scrutiny.
They should be kept to a minimum and be thoroughly tested prior to
installation. Any newly appearing SETUID root files should be
regarded with extreme suspicion. The following command will locate
all SETUID and SETGID files on the system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# find / -type f \
\( -perm -2000 -o -perm -4000 \) -ls
</pre></li><li><p>User home directory trees should also contain no
group, or world-writable subdirectories.</p></li><li><p>User login and shell configurations files&mdash;.login,
.profile, .cshrc, and so on&mdash;should also be owned by each user and
writable only by their owner.</p></li><li><p>Group memberships must be designed with care so
that users are given access only to those files and directories
they need.</p></li><li><p>Any tampering with system binaries, libraries,
configuration files, and other vital data must be detected right
away.</p></li></ul></div><p>All of these can be summarized into just two overriding
principles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Know what normal is (and get your system to that
state). This is made somewhat more difficult on Linux systems
because there is considerable variation in system file ownership
among the various distributions, so you will have to make some of
those decisions yourself.</p></li><li><p>Make sure it stays that way by continuously
monitoring it and performing regular backups.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Tripwire facility from the COAST project at Purdue
University can take care of the second step. Tripwire can record
the correct state of the file-system and then, some time later,
compare the current configuration with the saved one and report on
any differences. It can consider external attributes of a file such
as its ownership, protection, size, inode number (this would change
if a file were replaced using standard UNIX commands), inode
creation date, and file modification date.</p><p>However, since it is possible to modify a file without
changing any of these items, Tripwire also calculates a number of
file signatures for each file. In general, a file signature is a
value computed using the contents of the file. Tripwire can compute
file signatures using up to 10 different algorithms of varying
complexity and corresponding difficulty in forging.</p><p>While it is possible to alter a file and still retain the
same file signature for a single algorithm&mdash;in fact, it is
relatively easy to do so for lower quality file signatures such as
traditional checksums&mdash;altering a file without changing two or
more different file signatures is a very hard problem indeed. When
Tripwire checks the file-system, it can compare multiple file
signatures for each file, thereby virtually ensuring that any
alteration will be detected.</p><p>Tripwire has been ported to Linux, and it builds easily.
After you have finished compiling the executables, it is important
to run the test suite the package provides to ensure that
everything is operating properly. The following command initiates
the test suite:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# make test
</pre><p>To get started, you first run Tripwire in its initialization
mode (<b  >tripwire -init</b>). It is essential that you
do so on a system known to be clean; ideally, Linux will have been
reinstalled from the original media. In this mode, Tripwire creates
a database listing the current attributes and file signatures you
have requested for the files specified in its configuration file.
During this initial run, you should compute as many different file
signatures as you have CPU cycles to apply, including at least two
different highly secure algorithms. You should also set up the
configuration file to include as much of the system as possible, so
you'll have data even for files you won't necessarily be watching
on a regular basis should you ever need it.</p><p>The database will need to be similarly updated whenever an
operating system upgrade occurs (given the rebuild rate for Linux
kernels, that could be pretty often on some systems). Once the
database is created, it must be stored in such a way that it cannot
be tampered with under any circumstances (otherwise, a hacker
could, for example, replace a file and also alter the information
corresponding to it in the database). The Tripwire documentation
suggests placing it on physically write-protected media, such as a
locked diskette or removable disk, which is taken out of the drive
when it is not in use. When the database is protected in this way,
even changes made from a compromised root account can be detected.
If possible, the Tripwire software itself should also be similarly
protected.</p><p>After the initial database is created, Tripwire may be used
to check the integrity of the file-system. How regularly you run
Tripwire in this mode depends on the needs of your system and site,
but I would recommend doing so nightly if at all possible. Figure 1
gives an example of the sort of report that Tripwire
produces.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>On this system, the executable for the refer command is
missing, a new file (/etc/passwd.save) has appeared (from
Tripwire's point of view, anyway), and the executable for Perl has
changed size, modification time, and file signature (computed with
the MD5 algorithm). All these changes are important and should be
investigated, although none of them conclusively indicates
unauthorized activities (refer could have been deleted
accidentally, /etc/passwd.save could have been created as a backup
by a system administrator, and Perl could have been rebuilt since
Tripwire's database was last updated).</p><p>Tripwire's configuration file (conventionally named
tw.config) is very flexible and allows you to specify exactly what
files and directories are checked and what attributes and/or file
signatures are compared, in as much detail as you like.</p><p>Tripwire does an excellent job of monitoring the file-system
for any changes. However, there are other system functions that
also bear watching. The Computer Oracle and Password System (COPS)
performs several useful tests of system security, and I recommend
obtaining it and running it regularly. COPS is most useful for
checking the following items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The syntax and content of the password and group
files.</p></li><li><p>Anonymous ftp setup.</p></li><li><p>User environments: umask values and PATH variable
definitions as defined in users' login configuration files.</p></li><li><p>Searches for known-to-be-insecure versions of
commands by comparing the dates of system executables with data
from CERT advisories.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to Tripwire and COPS, the following other
facilities can be very useful for system security
monitoring:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The /var/adm/sulog file, which contains records of
each use of the su command (successful and unsuccessful). It should
be examined regularly.</p></li><li><p>The syslog facility: many subsystems log messages
via syslog. Its configuration file, /etc/syslog.conf, specifies
what types of messages are recorded as well as their destination
log file.</p></li><li><p>Data gathered by the optional accounting facility
can be useful for some kinds of detective work. In order to use
this subsystem, you will need to install the accounting and quota
kernel patches, rebuild the kernel, and compile programs in the
accounting utilities package.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) has created
the Merlin program as an easy-to-use graphical front end to several
security monitoring packages including COPS, Crack and
Tripwire.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d6580.0x15cf790"></a>Improving Network Security</h2></div></div><p>So far, we have focused on security issues that arise in the
context of a single computer system. However, most systems are
connected to networks, and so must deal with the variety of threats
which arise from that context.</p><p>Standard TCP/IP offers only limited mechanisms for
controlling network access, and they are designed for convenience
of access rather than true network security. In its standard form,
the /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of systems trusted by the
local host, and users with the same user name on one of these
remote systems can log into the local system via the network
without having to provide a password.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this makes sense. The problem
comes when an account on a remote system has been compromised;
trusting that system then puts your own system at risk as well. Of
course, this problem is magnified many times when it is a remote
root account that has been broken into. For this reason, it is a
very bad idea to allow password-less root access between systems,
and the /etc/hosts.equiv mechanism does not do so (however, the
other method for setting up account equivalence does),</p><p>Each entry in a .rhosts file contains a hostname and
(optionally) one or more user names. It allows password-less access
to the local account from the listed remote user names (or to a
user with the same user name, if the entry contains only a
hostname). For example, when the following .rhosts file is in user
chavez's home directory, it will allow user vasquez on hamlet and
user chavez on romeo to log in to her account via the network
without a password:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hamlet vasquez
romeo
</pre><p>The problem with the TCP/IP notion of trusted systems is that
trusting another system has implications beyond the interactions
between the local system and the trusted remote system. Inevitably,
trust operates in a transitive fashion: if system A trusts system
B, and system B trusts system C, then to some extent, system A
trusts system C whether it wants to or not and whether it knows it
or not. Such chains can go on indefinitely, and hackers are
notoriously good at exploiting them.</p><p>Accordingly, the following precautions will minimize the
risks of trusted network access to your system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Include the minimum number of hosts in
/etc/hosts.equiv.</p></li><li><p>Make sure there is no [cw]+[ecw] entry in
hosts.equiv (this acts as a wildcard and trusts every system in the
universe).</p></li><li><p>Use the <b  >-</b> entries supported by
the Linux version of this file as appropriate. A hostname preceded
by a minus sign in /etc/hosts.equiv requires a password from every
user from that system who wants to log in to the local system. It
also nullifies any entries for that host in all .rhosts files on
the system. Thus, this mechanism serves as a ways to override
transitive trust.</p></li><li><p>The Linux version of /etc/hosts.equiv allows
hostnames to be optionally followed by a username, which gives that
user password-less access to any non-root account on the local
system. I don't recommend using this feature.</p></li><li><p>No /.rhosts file should exist on the system; remote
root access should always require a password (if it is allowed at
all).</p></li><li><p>Monitor users' ~/.rhosts regularly for
inappropriate entries.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d6580.0x15c6808"></a>Finer Control Over Network Access</h2></div></div><p>The traditional hosts.equiv mechanism allows for only the
crudest level of access control. The TCP Wrappers package, which is
included with nearly every Linux distribution, provides for much
more detailed control over which remote hosts use what local
network services, as well as the ability to track and record
network-based system access.</p><p>The TCP Wrappers package provides the tcpd daemon which
introduces an additional layer between inetd, the primary TCP/IP
daemon, and the score of subdaemons that it manages. Daemons for
services like the telnet facility are started on an as-needed basis
by inetd; once TCP Wrappers is installed, requests for telnet
services go to it first and are granted only if the system
configuration allows it.</p><p>Once the tcpd daemon is built, you simply modify inetd's
configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf, placing any and all of its
subdaemons under tcpd's control. For example, Figure 2 shows how to
change the entry for the telnet daemon to use TCP Wrappers.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#service socket protocol wait? user  program         arguments
telnet   stream tcp     nowait root  /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
</pre><p>is changed to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#service socket protocol wait? user  program         arguments
telnet   stream tcp     nowait root  /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.telnetd
</pre><p>Access to network resources is controlled by TCP Wrappers'
configuration files, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. The
first file contains entries specifying which hosts may use which
services:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
in.telnetd : hamlet romeo
in.fingerd : LOCAL EXCEPT juliet
</pre><p>The first entry says that telnet requests from hamlet and
romeo will be honored, and the second entry says that remote finger
commands may be run from any local system except juliet (a local
system is defined as one not containing a period in its
name).</p><p>The hosts.deny file contains entries denying specific
services:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
netstat  : fool
in.tftpd : ALL
ALL      : ALL
</pre><p>The first entry denies the use of the netstat service to host
fool, the second entry disables the trivial ftp facility, and the
third entry acts as a catch-all, denying everything that hasn't
been explicitly allowed to everyone.</p><p>When tcpd considers a request for network services, it uses
the following process:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If hosts.allow authorizes its use, the request is
granted. The first applicable line in the file is used.</p></li><li><p>If no entry in hosts.allow applies, then hosts.deny
is consulted. If that file denies the service, the request is
denied, and again the first applicable line in the file is
used.</p></li><li><p>If no entry in either file applies, the request is
granted (note that an ALL:ALL entry in hosts.deny prevents this
case from coming into play).</p></li></ul></div><p>TCP Wrappers logs its activity to the syslog subsystem via
its daemon facility. It generates lots of data which can be
cumbersome to examine manually. The swatch package provides a
useful way of automatically sorting through any output stream for
events you specify in advance, and it is very useful in conjunction
with TCP Wrappers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d6580.0x15c6ff0"></a>Probing Network Vulnerabilities</h2></div></div><p>The network should be examined for potential security
problems on a regular basis just like the local system. The once
notorious Satan program provides one way of doing so. Satan is
designed to look for network vulnerabilities from the outside in.
It looks for a variety of problems, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The availability of notoriously insecure network
services, such as rexd and old versions of sendmail.</p></li><li><p>The setup of any ftp and/or tftp facilities.</p></li><li><p>A variety of NFS vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>X server vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>Unprotected modems.</p></li></ul></div><p>For those concerned about the misuse of such a powerful tool,
the Gabriel and Courtney packages attempt to detect suspicious uses
of Satan itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d6580.0x15c7518"></a>Don't Despair</h2></div></div><p>We've covered a wide variety of threats to system security in
this article. Don't let the sheer number of them overwhelm you. All
you can do is protect your system as well as is currently possible
and make frequent backups so that you can recover quickly in the
event that your best efforts are not enough. Remember that system
security is an ongoing process, not something you can take care of
once and then forget about. And as in all of life, there are no
guarantees.</p><p>See sidebars for <a href="1206s1.html" target="_self">security
