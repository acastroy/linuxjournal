    Why UCITA is unacceptable to the Open Source community.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f35580.0x202d500"></a></h2></div></div><p>About a year ago I was working with
another attorney to change the Maryland UCITA statute to be
friendlier to open source. UCITA, the Uniform Computer Information
Transactions Act, is a model code intended to be adopted by all
states so that there is uniformity to the law of software
licensing. UCITA provides default rules that apply when a software
license omits essential terms. Another purpose of UCITA is to
define what license terms are against public policy and thus cannot
be enforced even if they are included in a license.
</p><p>In many respects UCITA is like the Uniform Commercial Code.
For example, the UCC sets rules to prevent a merchant from foisting
shoddy goods on an unsuspecting public. In that same vein, early
versions of UCITA stated that it is against public policy for a
software license to disclaim the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p><p>UCITA requires, regardless of what the license says, that a
licensor provide warranty protection if the licensed software turns
out not to be fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was
intended or to conform to the promises made in its documentation or
marketing materials.</p><p>Damages for breach of warranty can be substantial. In
appropriate situations, a licensee can recover for any loss
resulting from the breach, the difference between the value of the
software accepted and the software delivered, and even incidental
and consequential damages.</p><p>The makers and distributors of open-source software cannot
afford these implied warranties. If software is given away along
with the source code, then how does an open-source licensor recover
the cost of the warranties? That's why all open-source licenses
declare that the software is made available <span   class="emphasis"><em>as
is</em></span> and without warranty.</p><p>Maryland is one of the few states that has adopted UCITA. The
implied warranties in the Maryland law were unacceptable to the
Open Source community. After hearing our arguments, and to correct
this situation, the Maryland legislature adopted the following
amendment to UCITA:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The warranty [of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose] does not apply to a computer program if there
is no charge for (1) the source code, (2) making copies, or for use
of those copies, (3) modifying, and (4) redistributing the computer
program.</p></blockquote></div><p>UCITA is adopted state-by-state. To help avoid dealing with
this issue piecemeal, representatives of the Open Source community
then sought the adoption of an amendment to the uniform code
itself. The Maryland statute was submitted for consideration by the
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws
(NCCUSL), the author of UCITA.
</p><p>Instead, the provision the NCCUSL committee adopted reads as
follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the
warranties [of merchantability and fitness for a specific purpose]
do not apply to a computer program if the licensor makes a copy of
the program available to the licensee in a transaction in which
there is no contract fee for the right to use, make copies of,
modify, or distribute copies of the program.
</p><p>(b) Subsection (a) does not apply if the copy of the computer
program is contained in and sold or leased as part of goods or if
the transaction is with a consumer licensee that is not a software
developer.</p></blockquote></div><p>The replacement of &ldquo;and&rdquo; with &ldquo;or&rdquo; toward the end of
subsection (a), and the omission in that sentence of the
requirement that the source code be available, are very important
changes. It means that companies that bundle their &ldquo;free&rdquo;
software with software for which they charge license fees&mdash;as
Microsoft does with Internet Explorer, for example&mdash;are eligible
for the warranty exemption even though they do not satisfy any of
the other criteria of open-source software. It guts the entire
purpose of the amendment.
</p><p>The addition of subsection (b) is another dangerous trap for
the unwary. The second part of that subsection means that the
warranty exemption is fine when the software is distributed to
other software developers, but as soon as the software is
distributed to real users or customers, the implied warranties are
required. Thanks, but no thanks!</p><p>A letter from the National Association of Attorneys General,
signed by attorneys general from 32 states, was submitted to the
UCITA Standby Committee on November 13, 2001. It contains
criticisms of UCITA in general, but contains no substantive
proposals for any amendments of any kind. The letter effectively
states that there are no conceivable amendments of any kind that
might be proposed to improve UCITA as suitable law for computer
information contracts.</p><p>As long as UCITA doesn't adequately address concerns about
its fairness and effectiveness, including the concerns of the Open
Source community, it will not likely be adopted by enough states to
make it useful. We must remain vigilant, state-by-state, to prevent
the adoption of this flawed law.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and the law of your jurisdiction.
Even though an attorney wrote this article, the information in this
article must not be relied upon as a substitute for obtaining
specific legal advice from a licensed attorney.</p></div></div>
