    David continues his series on the Netfilter framework with a
    look at NAT and how to avoid common errors when constructin
    iptales rules.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0xeac660"></a></h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Editor's Note: Due to a printer
error, David Bandel's article on iptables building was not complete
in the magazine. We present it here in it's entirety.</em></span>
</p><p>One of the best tools at our disposal within the Netfilter
framework is NAT. NAT allows us to obfuscate (but not hide) our
true network, forcing would-be black hats to work harder (and
possibly go after easier targets). It also permits us to make the
best use of limited IPs. Last month [see &ldquo;Netfilter 2: in the POM
of Your Hands&rdquo; in the May 2002 issue of <i  >LJ</i>]
we looked at extending iptables to include experimental or beta
matches and targets. This month we look at doing NAT the correct
way, take a closer look at one or two other matches, then see what
some of the more common errors are when constructing iptables rules
and how to avoid them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0xeac870"></a>SNAT, DNAT and Managing Services</h2></div></div><p>Given the shortage of usable IPv4 addresses left today, it's
likely your ISP didn't provide you enough IPs to run all your
systems. If you're lucky, you got more than half a dozen you could
actually use. But if you don't use them, you'll lose them. And you
don't want that, or there's no room for expansion tomorrow. So
you're going to make your firewall look like as many systems as you
have IPs to use. How to do that? The easiest way is to assign all
your IPs to one NIC (the one connected to your ISP) and SNAT
connections so they look like they come from each IP in turn (this
example assumes your internal network is 192.168.0.0/24, which is
bound to eth1, and your usable IPs are
209.127.112.26-209.127.112.30, which are bound to eth0):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING
-o eth0 -s
--to-source <span   class="emphasis"><em>209.127.112.26-209.127.112.30</em></span>
</pre><p>Now iptables will NAT the first connection to .26, the second
to .27, the third to .28 and so on, wrapping around to .26 after
the connection to .30.
</p><p>One word of caution: test this before you deploy it. I've had
one router that didn't like seeing multiple IPs sourced from the
same MAC address. It would pass the first connection, but
subsequent connections would time out. The router's built-in
firewall (which couldn't be turned off by the client) most likely
thought the other packets were spoofed and was silently dropping
them.</p><p>Let's make sure we accept all outgoing connections but only
accept incoming connections that are related to these outgoing
connections:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i ! eth0 -m state
--state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth0 -m state
--state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth0 -m state
--state NEW,INVALID -j DROP
</pre><p>Now that we've managed outgoing traffic, let's assume we've
moved all our services inside this firewall. We'll further assume
they are all inside eth1 on the 192.168.0.0/24 network. Each
service has two IPs associated with it: an external IP that the
world sees and an internal IP that we see. Specifically, we'll
assign the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Apache web server (serves both insecure and secure
connections): 209.127.112.26 and 192.168.0.4</p></li><li><p>FTP server: 209.127.112.27 and 192.168.0.5</p></li><li><p>Primary DNS server: 209.127.112.26 and
192.168.0.6</p></li><li><p>Secondary DNS server: 209.127.112.28 and
192.168.0.7</p></li><li><p>Primary mail server: 209.127.112.28 and
192.168.0.8</p></li><li><p>Secondary mail server: 209.127.112.29 and
192.168.0.9</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Because of our iptables state table rules above, each service
(or more specifically, each port that corresponds to that service)
will not only have to be forwarded through the firewall to the
correct IP inside, but we'll need a rule to accept that NEW
traffic. Starting with Apache, which in our case uses both ports 80
and 443 (for SSL), we have:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d
-p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d <span   class="emphasis"><em>209.127.112.26</em></span> -p tcp --dport 443 -j
ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d
--dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.0.4</em></span>
</pre><p>Notice that we had to insert a rule in the FORWARD chain.
This is because we already have a more general rule that would have
dropped NEW connections. We can insert a rule anywhere in a chain,
but if we don't specify where, the default is to insert it as the
first rule. Normally, this will not be a problem and will put our
specific rules ahead of our general rules.
</p><p>Note that we also specified the IP on which this connection
should show. This is not necessary because connections showing up
on other IPs will be handled by the state table and dropped, unless
we've done something really questionable and started a web server
on our firewall. If no ports on our firewall are open, we're okay.
We always can protect them just in case by ensuring we also have
stateful rules for our INPUT chain:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i ! eth0 -m state
--state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i eth0 -m state
--state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i eth0 -m state
--state NEW,INVALID -j DROP
</pre><p>The first rule above allows NEW, ESTABLISHED and RELATED
connections from lo (the localhost interface) as well as any
internal devices, omitting only our external device, which is dealt
with in the next two rules.
</p><p>Next we look at the FTP connection. This is straightforward
and exactly the same as the above rules, but for port 21:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp
--dport 21 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0
-d
--to-destination <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.0.5</em></span>
</pre><p>We don't have to worry about the FTP-data channel (port 20)
because our FTP server opens it outgoing, and our state rules will
pass this new connection out.
</p><p>Now it gets a little more difficult. DNS works on both UDP
for normal queries and TCP for zone transfers. If we don't want to
allow zone transfers to the outside, we only open UDP. If we want
to allow zone transfers, then we have to allow both. Assuming we
want to allow both, we know that we can specify UDP, TCP or ICMP as
protocols. You must specify -p (protocol) in order to specify a
port. If you want both UDP and TCP, you should be able to say &ldquo;not
ICMP&rdquo;, and the other two are assumed automatically. Unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.</p><p>When you specify a protocol, even if you say <b  >-p !
ICMP</b>, it's the ICMP match module that is loaded, not the
TCP and UDP match modules. So you'll get an error message when you
specify a port. This is a danger with using a negative match; the
match module that is loaded is the module specified, not the
modules you may assume are loaded. You must specify positively each
match you want so the corresponding match module is loaded.</p><p>For now, let's assume you are only interested in opening the
UDP port:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i eth0
-d
--to-destination
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i eth0
-d
--to-destination <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.0.8</em></span>
</pre><p>And finally, we need to deal with our mail host:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d <span   class="emphasis"><em>209.127.112.28</em></span> -i eth0 -p TCP --dport 25 -J
ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i eth0
-d
--to-destination
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0
-d <span   class="emphasis"><em>209.127.112.29</em></span> -i eth0 -p UDP --dport 25 -J
ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i eth0
-d
--to-destination <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.0.9</em></span>
</pre>


We can now accept incoming mail. Does anyone see a problem here?
</p><p>If we test our outgoing mail using <b  >mail -v
user@another.dom</b>, our firewall will grab one of
209.127.112.25-209.127.112.30. If our DNS records say our MX host
is 209.127.112.28, then we have only a 20% chance of grabbing that
IP and an 80% chance that upstream mail hosts will bounce our mail
as not being from a host with a DNS MX RR&mdash;not good.</p><p>So how do we fix this? If we have the luxury of adding
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> our IPs as MX hosts, that would solve part
of the problem, but then upstream hosts might spend time connecting
to IPs of ours that don't DNAT the mail through. And we really
don't want all those IPs to appear as MX IPs.</p><p>The correct response is to add a more specific SNAT rule
ahead of the general SNAT rules that will handle outgoing traffic
on port 25. The danger here is that if we can't trust our internal
users, we also must make sure that internal users can't abuse port
25. So we'll add three rules for outgoing traffic, one to SNAT port
25 traffic coming from our primary mail server (192.168.0.8) only
out through 209.127.112.28, and two to block port 25 traffic from
all other internal addresses except our true mail host:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth1
-s
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp
--dport 25 -s
-I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -p tcp --dport 25
-s <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.0.8</em></span> -j SNAT --to-source <span   class="emphasis"><em>209.127.112.28</em></span>
</pre><p>Some of you may think: hah! caught him. The first two rules
above are reversed. Well, yes, they are. But that's because we're
inserting them one at a time as the first rule, so rule two above
will really be rule one in the FORWARD chain after running them
both. The SNAT rule is in another chain, so it could have gone
anywhere. Also, I suggest you make sure the first rule above is
correct for your system. If the untrusted network is
192.168.0.0/24, and the trusted network is 192.168.1.0/24, you may
need the source (-s) to be 192.168.0.0/23 to cover both. Or,
perhaps just drop the -s option and match on the inbound interface
(-i).
</p><p>I suggest that the best way to build a firewall is to walk
through each chain to see where and how (or even if) a particular
packet will be handled. Don't do as we've been doing here inserting
rules seemingly willy-nilly. Build your chain on paper with all the
rules in the correct order. Then you won't make mistakes. You can
always check afterward to make sure the rules are as you think you
wanted them with: <b  >iptables -t &lt;table&gt; -L
-nv</b>. The above rule with the -v included will show you
how many packets and how many bytes are affected by this rule. If,
after a week has gone by, you still have rules with 0 bytes
affected by it, you might want to relook at that rule's position in
the chain. But just because a rule has affected packets doesn't
mean it's in the right place. It may have only affected half the
packets that really should have been affected.</p><p>I'm waiting for someone to write &ldquo;the killer app&rdquo; for
Netfilter, and that would be a utility that runs tests, analyzes
the rules and allows you to move them around and test again. But
until that day comes, you'll have to do it by hand.</p><p>Some of you may have noticed that I make heavy use of -i
eth0, or -i ! eth0, but in general match an interface. Often, you
can probably see that this isn't necessary because I've limited the
source IP address or some other part of the packet header that
pretty much ensures matching what we want. But I do this for a
particular reason. I turn off rp_filters (reverse path filters).
These tend to interfere with legitimate VPN packets. Besides,
Linux's rp_filter is nowhere near as granular as iptables.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0xeadcb8"></a>Protecting Your Data</h2></div></div><p>It's very difficult to make sure someone on the inside isn't
passing data through your firewall that shouldn't go out. And maybe
some folks have a legitimate reason for passing company data out
through the firewall. But let's assume for now that that's not the
case. You want to stop certain data from leaving (or at least
attempt to do so).</p><p>We can try to prevent certain data from leaving by marking
that data, then looking for that mark using the string match. Here
I suggest a policy of putting a string, such as &ldquo;Copyright,
foo.corp, not for publication&rdquo; at the top of those files you don't
want sent through the firewall. Then, on the inner firewall, or as
a rule on eth2 (where eth0 is the Internet, eth1 is the untrusted
LAN and eth2 is the trusted LAN) on your outer firewall, you might
want something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth2 -m string
--string="Copyright, foo.corp, not for publication"
-j DROP
</pre><p>A few words about this particular solution. First, ensure you
have the ipconntrack module loaded. This will defragment packets
and result in a much higher likelihood of seeing the string.
Second, don't expect this to catch everything. Particularly, if a
file has been compressed, the phrase will not be recognizable as
such. So this does have limitations.
</p><p>It will work very nicely, however, if you are running an IIS
server and want to drop packets with the string root.exe, for
example. The rule might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -m string
--string=root.exe -j DROP
</pre><p>While it might be amusing to use the MIRROR target and turn
the attack back on the attacker, this would be an ethically
questionable thing to do.
</p><p>You also have the PSD (port-scan detection) match if you're
still subject to this kind of activity. I don't see so much port
scanning anymore as I see script kiddies that have a particular
tool; they aim it at my systems and fire. Usually it's an FTP
attack designed to compromise an IIS server running FrontPage
extensions. I see an FTP in, then lots of activity trying to create
_vti_private files and the like. We can stop this with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp
--dport 21 -m string
--string="_vti_private" -j REJECT
</pre><p>Obviously, if you're running a FrontPage server and folks
aren't &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; to it (which uses port 80) but moving their
sites via FTP, the above won't work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0x12a6328"></a>Targets and Matches and More, Oh My!</h2></div></div><p>This article has not touched on a large number of extensions
and targets. Some of you with very specific routing requirements
might want to look at the MARK target, with or without the realm
match, to do some really funky routing tricks. This will require
use of iproute2 in conjunction with iptables. This is a very
powerful combination for ISPs or others with very specific routing
and bandwidth-limiting requirements.</p><p>Others of you probably wanted to see some ULOG target
examples or iplimit or mport examples. But these are very similar
to other matches or targets and are handled in the same way. Often
the help in the kernel configuration will show you enough of an
iptables rule fragment to make use of these extensions.</p><p>Just remember, only ACCEPT, DROP or REJECT are final targets
for a packet and stop iptables processing of a packet. The RETURN
target only terminates a chain, but not iptables processing.</p><p>I also haven't touched on the MANGLE table. But this table
works in the same manner as the mangle target in ipchains. Try it
out if you're so inclined. You may find you won't be able to use
the numeric (hex) targets but have to use the descriptive values.
If you can't remember what they are, try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -j TOS -h
</pre><p>This trick also works if you need a list of the ICMP types
because you want to handle a particular ICMP type with iptables
(such as permitting pings, which will be dropped by a firewall with
<b  >-m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED</b>):
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -p icmp -h
</pre>


Armed with the correct ICMP name, echo-request, you can permit
pings:
<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t filter -I INPUT -i eth0 -p icmp
--icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
</pre>


You also can rate-limit this using either iplimit or limit if
you're concerned about this. But note that limiting pings doesn't
limit the amount of traffic on your link, just the rate at which
you'll respond to this traffic. Anyway, standard ping packets are
so small and normally sent only once a second by any given host
that they're barely noticeable as traffic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0x12a66f0"></a>Errors</h2></div></div><p>Some common errors I've seen with iptables scripts include
choosing an inappropriate interface for packets. This includes not
selecting all interfaces that might be affected. Often lo, the
localhost interface, is forgotten about on systems used as both
firewall and host (usually a system used in a home). I've also seen
outgoing packets using the MANGLE table, the OUTPUT chain or the
SNAT target that have <b  >-i &lt;interface&gt;</b>
rather than <b  >-o &lt;interface&gt;</b>.</p><p>Sometimes rules get so specific nothing matches them. Try the
most general rule you can get away with, adding match extensions
only as required. Just be careful where these rules are located in
relation to other rules, so they're not picking up packets you
don't want them to.</p><p>Ensure you're using the right case: ipchains uses lowercase
for its built-in chains, but iptables uses uppercase. Targets are
also uppercase. Almost everything else is lowercase. If you're
using the short options (as I did in this article), the chain
action (Insert, Append, Delete, etc.) uses uppercase.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb4580.0x12a6958"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Netfilter and iptables make an extremely powerful firewall.
But to take advantage of it, you need to master the basic syntax as
explained in my first article (&ldquo;Taming the Wild Netfilter&rdquo;,
published in the September 2001 issue of <i  >LJ</i>),
have an understanding of the modules and matches available to you
and have an understanding of what a particular system can know
about a packet. Armed with these three things, you can build highly
complex, tailored firewall solutions for whatever problem you might
have.</p><p>Know how to take advantage of new and experimental matches
and targets (and always test them). You learned this in last
month's article with the iptables build targets of pending-patches,
most-of-pom and patch-o-matic. Testing by creating and sending
specific packets to a firewall interface is beyond the scope of
this particular article, but a number of utilities exist to assist
you here (sendip or ipmagic come to mind).</p><p>Build the missing modules for the kernel (make sure they're
selected).</p><p>Build your rule chains, more specific rules first followed by
more general rules. If it helps you organize things, go ahead and
build custom user chains that can be called from another chain.
While this was not covered specifically in this article, it was
addressed in the September 2001 article. Use everything at your
disposal, including the LOG target to help you see if particular
rules were applied and to which packets.</p><p>With just some basic knowledge, iptables are not difficult to
use. Read some iptables scripts on the Internet. I don't recommend
using them as they are; they almost certainly won't work for you
without a lot of tweaking, but they will show you syntax, rules
(from which you can grab fragments), thought processes, etc.</p></div></div>
