includes the x4000, which has a number of configuration options.
For our testing, HP delivered a top-of-the-line machine with two
2.2GHz Xeon processors, 4GB of RDRAM memory and a FireGL4 graphics
card, running Red Hat 7.1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1287580.0x137f6b8"></a>Goals of the Review</h2></div></div><p>Our company is a visual effects production company. From our
inception we had been using SGI workstations for both interactive
desktop use and for batch rendering. About two years ago we began
using generic Linux workstations for batch rendering, but we were
still using SGI machines for artist workstations. We now feel that
the maturity of both Linux and the newer hardware solutions are to
a point that they can provide far better artist workstations at a
reasonable cost.</p><p>We tested this x4000 as an artist workstation, as well as a
batch renderer. We installed a wide range of software and performed
a representative set of tasks over the course of three
weeks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1287580.0x137f818"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>As described above, the configuration is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>two 2.2GHz Xeon processors, with 512KB cache

has been ported to Linux from the SGI/IRIX environment over the
last couple of years. Installing this software on the x4000 was
trivial; everything copied over and worked perfectly with no
changes. This is a tribute to the maturity of Linux and the
expertise of HP and ATI in building compatible systems.</p><p>The x4000 was shockingly faster than the machines we had been
using (admittedly old SGI O2 computers). While it is unfair to
compare the x4000 to SGI machines made three years ago, it is still
revealing. The x4000 with the FireGL4 graphics board could display
both 2-D and 3-D information on the order of 30-50 times as fast as
our old O2s. Changes by a factor of two or four are amazing, but by
a factor of 40 is astonishing.</p><p>In the visual effects business, it is often true that 2-D
performance is as important as 3-D performance. Much of the work
involves working directly with hundreds or thousands of
high-resolution film frames, doing rotoscoping by tracing the
outlines of regions of an image, tracking features from frame to
frame and playing back high-resolution images to examine these
frames in motion. The x4000 with the FireGL4 had the best
performance I have ever seen, displaying more than 250 million
pixels per second. At a resolution of 1,600 &times; 1,200, it could
display 130 frames per second. There was sufficient processing
power available to do fairly complex color correction on the fly
and still get better than real-time performance.</p><p>While our test machine had only a 100-baseTX network card
(based on the Intel i82557 chipset), it was dramatically faster at
reading frames from our file server than our other Linux boxes,
often approaching 10MB/sec over NFS. This allows the animators to
be much more productive, as they are not waiting so long for the
next image to load.</p><p>Of course, 3-D performance is also vitally important; and it
is no surprise that this x4000 gave a stellar performance in this
area too. In simple tests viewing independent polygons, the machine
would render 2.5 million polygons per second. One can use
Alias|Wavefront's Maya to edit 100,000 polygon models with true
interactive performance. In general, the 3-D performance was so
astonishingly better than the performance of our SGI machines that
there was no comparison whatsoever; it was also dramatically faster
than the RADEON and GeForce cards on our other Linux
machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1287580.0x13808f0"></a>Experience as a Batch-Rendering Station</h2></div></div><p>For the three and a half weeks that we had the machine, it
was used almost nonstop as a rendering server. The 2.2GHz
processors were, on average, about 1.4 times as fast as the 1.3GHz
Athlon processors in the rest of our renderfarm. The huge 4GB of
memory allowed us to render far more complex scenes at once than we
could with our other smaller computers.</p><p>The SMP capabilities of the machine were a pleasant surprise,
in that the performance was almost perfectly double that of a
single-processor machine. Rendering two frames took almost exactly
the same time as rendering one; there was little contention for
shared resources. Furthermore, the SCSI disk offloaded the
processor, allowing the CPUs to run at full speed even during heavy
disk access&mdash;something not found in commodity ATA-based systems. An
artist could use one processor for background rendering, while
doing interactive work with the other processor without much
contention.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1287580.0x1380a50"></a>Problems and Glitches</h2></div></div><p>What I was most concerned with in replacing our
tried-and-true SGI workstations with Linux-based desktops were the
little glitches that lurk in the dark corners, unexpectedly ruining
one's experience. Other UNIX-based workstations don't have nearly
the price/performance ratio of PCs, but they are relatively
bulletproof. The qualification and testing that SGI or Sun put
their machines through guarantees some amount of freedom from
problems.</p><p>HP did their homework here and built a very solid machine.
There were none of the display glitches that we find in
consumer-grade machines. The FireGL4 was absolutely problem-free,
no speckling pixels during refreshes, no polygons where they
shouldn't be, no problems of any kind. The OpenGL drivers seem to
be every bit as mature as those on other workstations.</p><p>We did have minor problems that might be expected with
machines of this scale. Maya refused to run at first, claiming to
be out of memory (this turned out paradoxically to be a problem of
having too much memory). The 4GB in the machine is too large for
the 32-bit integer that Maya was using to store the amount of free
memory, wrapping around to a negative value. Booting Linux with
mem=2048k yielded perfect Maya performance.</p><p>There was a bit of a learning curve for us as well with the
window manager. Maya depends on using Alt-mouse button chords to
move the camera. It took us longer than it should have to realize
that GNOME had already intercepted these events&mdash;once we disabled
those combinations our camera moves worked as they should.</p><p>With RAYZ, there was a minor marking-menu problem, but fairly
simple workarounds were suggested by Silicon Grail.</p><p>The x4000 has an array of four diagnostic LEDs on the front
panel. These started flashing at one point, and the code was
deciphered as indicating a low CMOS battery. Reseating the battery,
as suggested by the manual, caused the problem to go away.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1287580.0x13775a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In general, I found the problems to be remarkably few and
easy to deal with. The software packages came up cleanly and easily
with no configuration headaches. Companies like HP,
Alias|Wavefront, Nothing Real and Silicon Grail recognize the size
and importance of the Linux desktop workstation community and
devote the required resources to release tested, well-qualified
solutions.</p><p>HP has made a formidable computer in the x4000. At least in
the fully outfitted configuration that we tested, it was a serious
competitor to anything from the traditional workstation vendors.
All of the advanced commercial software that we loaded worked as
expected, as did our in-house software. In every particular area
the performance was as high as anything we've seen, and all aspects
of the machine worked synergistically to provide a great
workstation.</p><p><a href="5945s1.html" target="_self">Product Information/The Good/The
