    Doc introduces PingID, an identity framework controlled by the

using a browser, she came up with a wish list of features that
nobody has come close to filling over the seven years since. One
was a shopping cart that would persist from one site to the next.
Another was a pull-down menu called &ldquo;purse&rdquo; that would contain
credit cards and other identity items required for doing business
in the world. Neither would be owned or provided by one vendor (not
even the browser's). Instead they would be features of the user's
own identity as an autonomous customer in the marketplace.
</p><p>In other words, she wanted the browser to be an instrument of
demand, rather than of supply. And she had reason to be encouraged.
That's what early versions of Netscape seemed to be about.</p><p>But our family's view of the browser business was a little
biased. One of the top executives at Netscape was a close relative.
So we rooted for Netscape in its famous battles with Microsoft. We
proudly wore Netscape T-shirts and other schwag. We were also
quietly frustrated when the company began to add all kinds of
extraneous crap to the browser and to become obsessed with its
portal: a site cluttered with partner links through which users
would be funneled to troughs of content, some of which were called
channels in the manner of television.</p><p>Rather than develop ways to empower customers to do business
in freshly networked markets, Netscape desperately went looking for
ways to &ldquo;aggregate eyeballs&rdquo; and make money the old-fashioned
way: as a media company. That seems to have made Netscape
attractive to AOL but not to its browser users.</p><p>Back in 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom, we wrote
&ldquo;markets are getting smarter&mdash;and getting smarter faster than most
companies&rdquo; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span>. That
thinking was influenced (in my case, at least) by what I saw
happening in the development bazaar where Linux was growing and
flourishing. Linux was proof that markets were more than just
labels that suppliers tacked on demographics and product
categories. Like the Net on which it grew, Linux was good for both
the demand and the supply side, even when it was just being put to
use as available free material rather than as something bought and
sold. A market that used Linux resourcefully was more than a smart
market; it was ahead of the curve.</p><p>What makes markets smart is the ease with which people can
share information and expertise. But what is it that makes markets
powerful? Is it just what economists call buying power&mdash;a sum of
money ready to be spent? Would it not also be about how goods get
valued and money gets spent?</p><p>Most of us are only familiar with a few ways to spend money:
cash, checks and credit cards. But what if there were more ways to
spend money? And better ways too? Let's take it a step farther.
What if markets were comprised of something more than the presence
of buyers and sellers transacting business? What if markets were
also comprised of relationships? I'm not just talking about the
relationships each of us have with our phone companies, our banks,
our credit-card companies and various retailers (although those are
on the table here). I'm talking about relationships with experts
whose opinions we value and whom we might be willing to compensate
for informing our buying and selling decisions&mdash;if the means were
in place and the costs were minimal. One example would be
magazines; we could pay a small sum on an &agrave; la carte basis
for expert opinions they've aggregated about wines, cars, travel,
music or other topics.</p><p>What if each of us had the power to control the terms of our
relationships with every company whose goods and services we value,
including the ability to exchange micropayments for microservices
and microproducts on an as-needed basis?</p><p>What if every channel carried by every cable and satellite TV
system were available on an &agrave; la carte basis? Yes, you could
subscribe, or you could pay as you go&mdash;up to you.</p><p>The main reason we have a hard time imagining these scenarios
isn't just that the technical problems are daunting. It's that
we're too accustomed to operating as consumers. We see all our
power located in near-binary choices. Which will it be...local
cable, DishTV, DirecTV or nothing? End of menu.</p><p>Yes, the Net might make us smarter customers than we used to
be; but in way too many categories, supply is still in
charge.</p><p>But what if we stop looking like wallets with eyeballs? What
if we start looking like a business interface, with our own native
protocols and APIs, wrapped around a unique identity that nobody
outside ourselves is free to manage? What if we possess a lot of
ways to do business other than presenting cash or credit cards?
What if the nature of our personal protocols and APIs allowed
continuous relationships within which many transactions might take
place over a long period of time&mdash;and involve more money, and more
value, as both parties get to know and trust each other over
time?</p><p>This is the kind of stuff that's been going through my
mind&mdash;and through e-mail, phone and meat-space conversations&mdash;ever
since Andre Durand told me about PingID and asked me to serve on
its advisory board. Andre is the founder of Jabber, Inc., on whose
advisory board I also serve. Like Jabber, PingID has a .org and a
.com side, with an open-source development model for one and an
independent commercial development model for the other. Unlike
Jabber, the idea is to create something for everybody, namely an
identity framework controlled by the individual rather than by any
one company, including PingID. This framework would embody the
ability to be anonymous, pseudonymous and polynomolous. Most
importantly, it would serve as the infrastructural framework for
all kinds of businesses that welcome and value full-power
customers, ready not just to talk and to transact but to relate
over a period of time.</p><p>Andre describes identity as a three-tier affair. At the
center is tier one: that's your core identity alone. You're in
charge of it. Outside that is tier two. This is the identity issued
to you by the government, by retailers, by airlines, by insurance
companies, by credit-card companies. Every piece of plastic in your
wallet is a tier-two identity. Tier three is the cloud of highly
presumptuous identity information held by direct marketers and
others who hope you may be the one consumer in 50 who responds to a
promotional message.</p><p>When tier one becomes fully empowered, tier two suddenly
takes on fresh meaning and tier three becomes obsolete. Tier two
identities become links over which relationships can grow in both
directions. It's up to both parties. More significantly, new
relationships, and new kinds of relationships, are invited
in.</p><p>Let's say your palm phone knows by its GPS that you're in
Austin, Texas. You're looking for a good barbecue place. There must
be a lot of them, and maybe you could look around on the Web for
one, but you'd rather take advantage of local expertise on the
matter. Thanks to your relationship with Zagats, information about
barbecue places is pushed down to your device by an XML stream. By
prior agreement about these kinds of events, a micropayment is made
to Zagats for the information. And since Zagats has similar
relationships with its own sources of expert information, some of
your micropayment gets passed along to its original sources. Yes,
it's easy to imagine all the things that could go wrong here. But
what's right is that your relationships are between equally
empowered participants. You're not just an infodump at the end of
some intermediary's conveyor belt for content of its own
choosing.</p><p>Andre's ideas here are still new and barely tested. As I
write this, development is only beginning on the project. But what
has me excited is that for the first time I'm seeing an identity
project that respects the individual as both an autonomous and
private soul, and as a fully potentiated participant in real
markets where customers, vendors and everybody else can operate on
agreeable terms, and everybody is fully capable of forming any
relationships they want.</p><p>If this goes the way I hope and expect it will, the project
should be equally attractive to both open-source and independent
commercial developers (which are not mutually exclusive
categories). And I believe the degree to which it can succeed
depends utterly on how well we can jettison the industrial concepts
that have enslaved our minds ever since industry won the Industrial
Revolution.</p><p>Linux gave us a way to do exactly that with operating systems
and by helping us create the worldwide commons we call the Net.
Apache helped us do the same with web service. Sendmail did it with
e-mail. Jabber is starting to do it with instant messaging and XML
routing. Maybe PingID can do it with identity. If so, it will
contribute to the business ecosystem we call the Net's
commons.</p><p>This commons is an ideal platform for real markets. Without
completely autonomous customers, our markets will stay captive to
Supply. Even if they live on the Net.</p><p><a href="5964s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
