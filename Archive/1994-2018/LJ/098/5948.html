Python's inventor and PythonLab's director, to share some of his
thoughts about the latest Python news.

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span>
Guido, thanks for taking the time today to talk with us at <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> It's always a pleasure
to work with <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Give us one or two
sentences of overview about the new 2.2 releases.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> The release of 2.2 is
the first step on the way to a new object model for Python, where
built-in classes and user-defined classes finally have equal
footing. In addition, there's cool stuff, particularly
generators.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Why should current
developers migrate from Python 2.0.x or 2.1.x to 2.2.x?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> To benefit from the
new style class features, such as properties, static methods and
subclassing list and dict, or for generators.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Why should current
developers migrate from Python 1.x to 2.2.x?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> In addition to the
features already mentioned, to benefit from the tons of bugs that
were fixed and the features added in 2.0, such as list
comprehensions, Unicode, XML and a new regular expression
implementation. If you're happy using 1.5.2, be my guest. If
there's anything in 1.5.2 that irks you, there's a good chance it's
been fixed in 2.x.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Some developers have
never seen iterators or generators before. Where did they come
from, and why were they added to Python?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> C++ has iterators, and
they are actually a pretty common programming pattern, just not
usually a language feature. But in an interpreted language like
Python, the boundary between the language and the library is often
blurred. Generators come from a little-known language called Icon,
but they deserve to be in the spotlight; they are an incredibly
powerful way to write more readable code for certain situations.
You can also see them as a tamed form of co-routines, an old idea
(described, for example, by Knuth) that unfortunately went out of
style because it required stack fiddling.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span>
In many other object-oriented languages, classes are seen as types
and their instances as objects of those types. Why was this not the
case for Python and why the turnaround?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> That was an
implementation artifact. The very first version of Python (which
was never released, but used internally at CWI in early 1990)
didn't have a class statement; the only way to add a new data type
to a program was to write an extension in C. Someone suggested that
I add classes so that end users also could define new data types. I
invented an implementation that required minimal changes to the
abstract Python virtual machine. But the class statement couldn't
do exactly the same things as the C programmer could.I've known for
a long time that this needed to be fixed, but solving it required a
large implementation effort for which I didn't have the time
earlier on&mdash;in part because during the intervening ten years the
language had become so successful that I just couldn't change the
rules. I had to make sure that old code continued to work
unchanged, and I had to provide a migration path to using the new
features. I think I've succeeded at both.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> The changing of the
division operator has been the source of much controversy and
debate. What are you telling each side to keep flame wars to a
minimum?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> The folks who want the
new division operator don't need to be told to keep flame wars at a
minimal level&mdash;it's the people who mistakenly fear that all their
code will break overnight who need to be calmed down. It's the same
issue as with the new style classes: 99% of the implementation
effort went into finding ways to implement it without breaking old
code. No code using / for int division will have to be changed
until Python 3.0, which is several years off.In the meantime, folks
can choose on a per-module basis to use / for float division. I'm
also supplying two tools (finddiv.py and fixdiv.py) that can be
used to track down and fix / operators that would need to be
changed to // in order to work properly in Python 3.0. We've
already converted the entire standard library to using // where
necessary. It's not a particularly hard task, but it can't be 100%
automated because it's impossible to tell for sure at compile time
what the operand types are.By the way, a change to integer
semantics that is nearly universally liked is the automatic
conversion to the long type when any operation on ints would raise
an OverflowError.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Any new developments
for those who write Python extensions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> Yes, they can create
types that are subclasses of standard types, and they can create
types that are subclassable. There's a bunch of new slots in the
type object that extension authors can use to fine-tune what
happens when an object of their type is created or
destroyed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Python 2.2 brings a
good number of new and improved modules. What are your top ten
updates to the Python Standard Library?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> Surprisingly, I'm not
usually on the bleeding edge of the library, so I can't quite make
it to ten. First of all, there's the new e-mail package by Mailman
author Barry Warsaw. There's the hot-shot profiler by my colleague
Fred Drake, the XML-RPC support by Fredrik Lundh and, last but not
least, the IPv6 support, a coproduction of Jun-ichiro &ldquo;itojun&rdquo;
Hagino and Martin von Loewis. I think Python's IPv6 support is way
ahead of other languages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Are the new features
of 2.2 going to be included in Jython, the Java language Python
interpreter?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> Yes, the Jython
developers have been active on the python-dev mailing list to be
sure that we wouldn't add features that were unimplementable in
100% pure Java. This is one of the reasons why generator functions
require the use of a new keyword&mdash;Jython needs to know that
something is a generator at compile time. They released their final
Jython 2.1 soon after we released Python 2.1, so I expect that they
are working on Jython 2.2. The type-class unification work should
be easier in Jython than it was in the C implementation of Python,
because they were already basing both built-in types and
user-defined classes on Java classes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> Jython 2.1 was
released soon after Python 2.2. What version of Python is it most
compatible with? In other words, how far behind is Jython?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> The Jython version
numbers match the Python version numbers, so Jython 2.1 is
compatible with Python 2.1.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wesley</b></span> What can we look
forward to in Python 2.3? Any timeline for that release?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span> I expect 2.3 to be a
release of consolidation and performance tweaks, not of grand new
features like 2.2 was. We may also focus more on the standard
library than on changes to the core language. There's now a
schedule for 2.3; see PEP 283 for tentative future release dates. I
like doing a new release every six months, as we've done since
2.0.We are already done with 2.2.1, which is a pure bug-fix release
for 2.2, as 2.1.2 is a pure bug-fix release (the last one, I'm
sure) for 2.1. This is important because a lot of third-party code
is out there (Zope 2.5 for example) that depends on 2.1 and cannot
be migrated to 2.2 right away.</p><p>Editor's note: look for Wesley's article in next month's

Python 2.2.</p></div></div>
