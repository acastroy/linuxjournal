<a href="mailto:mjkanes@comcast.net">mjkanes@comcast.net</a></p><p>For one web site, you can redirect a local port on your
machine to the web site on the other side of the SSH
connection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -L1234:intranetserver:80

policy. Check with them first.
</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,
<a href="mailto:marc_bts@valinux.com">marc_bts@valinux.com</a></p><p>If you want to browse a lot of internal sites from the
outside, you can set up an Apache server with mod_proxy on your
work system, run the SSH tunnel as above and set your web browser's
proxy preference to localhost, port 1234. Apache mod_proxy can be
found at

had. They were recorded on an Exabyte 8200. I am trying to retrieve
some data off these tapes via a Linux box and a SCSI Exabyte 8505
tape drive. <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> told me that it
was not a tar archive. Do you know of any free way of retrieving
the Banyan data off this tape via Linux?</p><p>&mdash;Craig Johnson,
<a href="mailto:cjohnson@eypae.com">cjohnson@eypae.com</a></p><p>Yours is not a trivial case. A few pointers for reading other
system's tapes on Linux are available. They may not apply directly
to your case, but they can provide you with good ideas and
pointers. For reading tapes from other UNIX systems on your Linux
box, see
<a href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/linux_tape.html" target="_self">meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/linux_tape.html</a>.
Another old but worthwhile HOWTO for getting ideas can be found at
<a href="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Ftape-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Ftape-HOWTO.html</a>.
The first thing you need to find out is the format the data was
saved into the tape. From the hardware standpoint, finding out if
there was some data compression mechanism while writing data would
help. From the operating system and software standpoint, it could
be a UNIX typical format like a tar, a cpio or a dd dump; on the
other hand, it could be a proprietary format that was used to dump
the data to tape. Also, is it a multivolume backup (more than one
tape for all the data) or not? Assuming one of these UNIX-type
commands was used for data backup, it is common to find some
differences in the default behavior of the command used on the
writing machine to the one used on the reading machine. For
instance, on Linux, tar giving -o as one of the options causes the
command to try using older (V7) data formats when writing.</p><p>&mdash;Felipe Barousse Bou&eacute;,

about five years. Twice in the last three months our network tech
has traced multicast packets that appear to be originating from
this server. They are flooding the LAN and essentially bringing
legitimate traffic to a stop.</p><p>I am running the latest SuSE distribution. I can find nothing
that could be causing this problem. I have been using tcpdump for
the past three weeks to monitor the server in a standalone LAN
environment, but I see no multicast traffic. I also have monitored
/proc/net/dev and /proc/net/dev_mcast, and see no multicast
traffic.</p><p>Is there anything else I can do? The network tech will not
let me put the server back on-line until I can assure them the
problem will not arise again. Is there a process that runs
intermittently that could cause this problem?</p><p>&mdash;George Moreno,
<a href="mailto:ccgmoreno455@netscape.net">ccgmoreno455@netscape.net</a></p><p>It's hard to say what's causing this traffic, but you may be
able to persuade your admin that it will not happen again by
filtering outgoing multicast traffic. This can be done with
iptables:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/iptables -I OUTPUT -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j DROP
</pre><p>You'll still need to determine the source of this
problem, but this will at least keep these packets off your
network.

<a href="mailto:rconnoy@penguincomputing.com">rconnoy@penguincomputing.com</a></p><p>If your admin says that your machine is to blame, did he
capture what type of traffic he is seeing? This will help find the
culprit, whether it's your machine or someone else's.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
