you're among the shrinking number of people who haven't been
stunned by HDTV, you may have already seen it. Acrodyne Industries
(<a href="http://www.acrodyne.com" target="_self">www.acrodyne.com</a>),
the television transmitter division of Sinclair Broadcasting, has a
history of industry firsts, and the latest is embedding Linux in
their latest transmitters.</p><p>Andrew Domonkos, principal systems software engineer with AI,
says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are the first in our industry to introduce a
television transmitter system using Linux as its operating system.
Our-top-of-the-line HDTV transmitter series, the Quantum, uses an
industrial PC running Red Hat Linux in a network server
configuration. We chose Linux for both its reliability as well as
its networking potential. Running anything else would be
unacceptable; when a TV broadcaster goes off the air due to a
system controller problem, the loss in revenue can be
tremendous.</p></blockquote></div><p>A paper by Acrodyne's Marc Polovick explains:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux (which is internet synonymous) is a
UNIX-based OS and provided a valued starting point to this
requirement. It was the intent of the Quantum designers to use UNIX
as it was designed to be used, in a distributed processing
&ldquo;server/client&rdquo; environment, a real-time/object-oriented data
driven system architecture. A user-friendly GUI is provided and
displayed through one large LCD display device. This intuitive
graphics-based interface has been designed to be mimicked and
provide secure &ldquo;remote anywhere&rdquo; monitoring capabilities that are
network accessible in almost every network environment.

At the receiving end, Linux has become a common operating system in
set-top boxes as well. In fact, National Semiconductor recently
created Linux4.TV, &ldquo;Where open-source Linux meets interactive
television&rdquo;--for engineers working on products that use the
company's Geode SC1200 integrated processor and SP1SC10 development
platform.

upbeat for Linux folks, but the latest report (March 2002) isn't.
Look at the main graphs at
<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey" target="_self">www.netcraft.com/survey</a>,
and you'll see a tug of war between Apache and Microsoft IIS web
servers that's been going on since 1998. In 2001 IIS made some
significant gains on Apache, which held shares upwards of 60%, but
those finally seemed to reverse in February 2002. But in March, IIS
gained 4.89%, while Apache dropped 4.67%, to percentages among Top
Developers of 57.36% for Apache and 34.02% for IIS.</p><p>Netcraft says this represents a shift of about two million
sites, &ldquo;primarily as a result of register.com and Network
Solutions migrating their domain parking facilities to a Windows
front end. <a href="http://Register.com" target="_self">Register.com</a>
had been serving from Apache on Linux and is in the midst of
migrating to Windows&rdquo;, Netcraft reports.</p><p>Of course, parked domains are a lot less functional than
active ones, so this probably doesn't say much about the real and
practical uses of the Web from the server side. But it's still
annoying to lose even a few bragging rights share points.</p><p>Perhaps when these big registrars finish migrating to the
Dark Side, the Apache share erosion will cease, or even turn
around.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x165c7a0"></a>It's Trivial</h2></div></div><p>Questions</p><p>Q1. One day in the 1940s, Harvard's famed Mark II, the
precursor to today's computers, failed. When the problem was
investigated, Grace Hopper and her colleagues found that a moth had
lodged itself in the circuits, causing the machine to malfunction.
The moth was removed with a pair of tweezers (and later was
preserved at the Naval Museum in Dahlgren, along with Homer's
logs). What word is derived from this incident?</p><p>Q2. We have all heard of various flavours of UNIX: AIX,
Digital UNIX, HP-UX, Sun-Solaris, IRIX, SCO UNIX. The question is
simple: which organization was responsible for development of
Xenix, a version of UNIX that ran on PCs and was compatible with
AT&amp;T's System V Definition?</p><p>Q3. This person is often known as the Wizard of Woz. When he
was 18 years old, he used to sell an illegal device called Blue Box
at Homebrew Computers, which enabled people to make free
long-distance calls. He used the name Oak Toebark, and his first
call with this device was to the Pope in the Vatican to make a
confession. Who is he?</p><p>Q4. In the lobby of Cyrix Corporation's headquarters in Texas
there is a huge tomb. What famous words are inscribed on the tomb?
(Guessable if you think of the competitors.)</p><p>Q5. How and where would you most probably read the
following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a
roiling cloud of vengeance. The house of the unbelievers shall be
razed and they shall be scorched to the earth. Their tags shall
blink until the end of days.</p></blockquote></div><p>Q6. The author of this program had worked for a year as a
volunteer with a project in southern Uganda. After he returned, he
found his heart was still there. So, he made a program that we all
probably use: Charityware. According to the author, &ldquo;You can use
and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a
donation to orphans in Uganda.&rdquo; Who is the author and which
program are we talking about?
</p><p>Q7. Ian Hutton, a Microsoft spokesman, admitted a certain
wrongdoing on Microsoft's part. He also complained that Microsoft
and its PR firm had been receiving malicious and obscene e-mail
from Linux fans. In response to this, Eric S. Raymond said, &ldquo;One
wonders if Hutton believes it would be unprofessional to address
strong language to a burglar caught nipping the family silver.&rdquo;
What event is being talked about here?</p><p>Q8. Charles Augustus Lindbergh was the first

Roosevelt was <span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span>: Man of the Year three
times, in 1932, 1934 and 1941. Who was the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span>: Man of the Year in 1982?</p><p>Q9. He was a wild Greek centaur who tried to abduct Deianira,
Hercules' new bride, while ferrying her across the River Evenus.
Hercules heard her cries and shot an arrow into the heart of this
centaur. The teenage author of an open-source security software was
looking for a name for his project when he chanced upon this name
while flipping through the pages of a mythology book. Immediately
taken by how cool it sounded, he named his software after this
centaur. Name this centaur/software.</p><p>Q10. I am a member of the Merrill Lynch's Technology Advisory
Board and appeared as a supporting artist in two record albums: &ldquo;A
Song of Gods Gone Mad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Full Circle&rdquo;. I am close to
completing a science fiction book titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shadows and
Stars</em></span> and am a Tae Kwon Do Federation 1st Dan Black
Belt. Netscape Communications described my paper as a major factor

engineering. Who am I?</p><p>Answers</p><p>A1. Apparently, on discovering the moth, Hopper exclaimed,
&ldquo;There is a bug in the computer.&rdquo; From then on, whenever there
was a problem with the computer, scientists said they were looking
for bugs. Even today, any software mistake is called a bug.</p><p>A2. Surprising as it may sound, Xenix was developed by
Microsoft Corporation.</p><p>A3. Steve Wozniak of Apple Computers fame. According to John

Put Up an</h2></div></div><p>Anti-UNIX Web Site that Runs on UNIX
</p><p>In late March 2002, Microsoft and Unisys launched a publicity
campaign against Sun, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and every other
competitor that runs UNIX&mdash;including Linux&mdash;on its big systems. The
publicity campaign was scheduled to run for 18 months and cost
upwards of the $25 million that Unisys said it was spending alone
on the project.</p><p>Rather than compete on the merits of Microsoft's and Unisys'
competitive product offerings, the company decided to wage the
high-tech equivalent of a negative political campaign. Titled &ldquo;We
have the way out&rdquo;, the campaign incredibly accuses UNIX of
cornering customers in an expensive box. One ad says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>No wonder Unix makes you feel boxed in. It ties
you to an inflexible system. It requires you to pay for expensive
experts. It make you struggle daily with a server environment
that's more complex than ever.</p></blockquote></div><p>As if the words in this ad were not sufficiently irony-free,
the campaign's web site,
<a href="http://wehavethewayout.com" target="_self">wehavethewayout.com</a>,
was found to have been served by Apache on FreeBSD. After that bad
publicity became news, the site was moved to Windows, first at the
same Verio hosting service, and then at Unisys. But in the process
it went dark, displaying either a blank white page or a 403 error
message.
</p><p>Later the page came back up, offering membership in &ldquo;our
ecommunity&rdquo; and five PDF papers to download. The web page was
copyrighted by Unisys Corporation.</p><p>The campaign was reportedly intended to promote Unisys'
ES7000 server and the Datacenter version of Windows 2000, which can
run on machines with as many as 32 processors. Unisys faces an
uphill battle in this category&mdash;not only with Sun and HP, which
have had strong UNIX offerings for many years, but from IBM's new
eServers, which run either Linux or Microsoft OSes on systems with
up to 16 processors and sell at lower prices than Unisys' ES7000s.
CNET also reports that only &ldquo;a few hundred&rdquo; ES7000 servers have
been sold and that &ldquo;sales partnerships with Dell, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard have all fallen apart&rdquo;.</p><p>Naturally a new site called
<a href="http://wehavethewayin.com" target="_self">wehavethewayin.com</a>
appeared shortly after
<a href="http://wehavethewayout.com" target="_self">wehavethewayout.com</a>
fell on its face. With pointers to all the leading UNIX variants,
<a href="http://wehavethewayin.com" target="_self">wehavethewayin.com</a>

emphatically rejected its business model, it's perilously close to
rewriting the software and hardware rules to force the market to
