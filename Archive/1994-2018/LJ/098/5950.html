    Discover how ZPT attributes can work with HTML to create
    useful and compatible dynamic web sites.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6a608"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the early days of the Web, nearly
everyone working on a web site was a programmer of some sort. You
could be sure that every webmaster had installed his or her own web
server, knew how to hand-code HTML and could write rudimentary CGI
programs on their own.
</p><p>Over time many editors, designers and other nonprogrammers
became involved in the creation of web sites. Although it was often
possible to teach these people HTML, it was HTML that was only good
enough for static web pages.</p><p>Dynamically generated pages, which were then created almost
exclusively by CGI programs, are another story altogether. After
all, if the designer wants to change a site's background color on a
static site, then he or she can simply modify the appropriate HTML
files (or site-wide stylesheet, in today's world). But if such
designs sit within a CGI program, the designer then must ask a
programmer to make that change. This situation is bad for everyone;
the designer cannot easily experiment with new ideas, the
programmer is forced to make small and annoying changes and other
programming work is put on hold while the programmer makes the
changes.</p><p>For a number of years, the mainstream solution to this
problem has been the use of templates, which mix HTML and a
programming language. Perhaps the best-known commercial
implementation of such templates is Microsoft's Active Server Pages
(ASP), but Sun's JavaServer Pages (JSPs) is also quite popular.
Open-source software developers have produced many high-quality
template implementations of their own, including HTML::Mason (which
works best with mod_perl), PHP (a programming language used for web
templates) and ADP (available with AOLServer).</p><p>The idea behind such templates is quite simple: everything is
assumed to be static HTML, except what is placed within a special
set of brackets. When working with such templates, the designer is
basically told, &ldquo;You can modify everything that doesn't appear
inside of &lt;% and %&gt;.&rdquo; And indeed, this often can work
well.</p><p>But over time, the drawbacks of such templates become
increasingly apparent. For starters, what happens when you want to
loop through a number of items that you have retrieved from a
database, displaying each item in a different background color
depending on its content? In such a case, you cannot ask the
designer to ignore the code because the code and HTML are so
intertwined.</p><p>Zope, the application server that we have been looking at the
last few months, tried to solve this problem using something they
call DTML (Dynamic Template Markup Language). As we saw several
months ago, DTML is a programming language with an HTML-like syntax
that allows developers and designers alike to create dynamic pages.
DTML is powerful, flexible and easy to understand (at least if
you're a programmer).</p><p>But if you're not a programmer, then even DTML can be
difficult to understand, particularly when it is retrieving results
from a database (as we saw last month). Moreover, HTML editors
don't know what to do with the DTML tags, which can lead to the
inadvertent mangling of DTML pages.</p><p>For all of these reasons, Zope Corporation (formerly Digital
Creations), which develops the open-source Zope application server,
is now encouraging developers to look at Zope Page Templates (ZPT),
a new approach to templates meant to solve most of these problems.
This month we examine ZPT, looking at ways in which we can use it
to create dynamic sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6a9d0"></a>What Is ZPT?</h2></div></div><p>ZPT takes advantage of three facts: HTML can be expressed in
XML syntax, often known as XHTML; XML allows you to mix tags and
attributes from different document definitions by using separate
namespaces; and WYSIWYG HTML editors generally ignore (but
preserve) attributes they do not recognize.</p><p>ZPT thus modifies the core HTML syntax by adding new
attributes that sit in a separate namespace. Because these
attributes are in a separate namespace, they are legal XML and
XHTML. Because they are attributes and not tags, most HTML editors
will ignore them, rendering the tag as if the attribute did not
exist. And because web browsers ignore attributes that they do not
understand, they can render ZPT pages without having to go through
Zope.</p><p>In other words, ZPT makes it possible for a programmer to
mock up a page so that a designer can then edit and view it using
any tools they like. Of course, the dynamic elements of the
template go into effect only when the template is viewed using
Zope.</p><p>In HTML, each attribute has a name and a value, e.g., in
<b  >&lt;a href="http://www.lerner.co.il/"&gt;Reuven's
site&lt;/a&gt;</b>, the attribute href had the following
value: http://www.lerner.co.il/. The name and value are separated
by an equal sign (=), and the value sits inside of double quotation
marks. None of this changes when we work with ZPT, except that the
attribute name is defined by TAL (Template Attribute Language). TAL
defines a number of different possible attributes names, each of
which directs Zope to modify the template in a different way when
it is displayed.</p><p>TAL defines the attribute names, but what defines the
attribute values? For that, we use TALES (TAL Expression Syntax).
TALES defines a number of sources for data, including Python
expressions and values from the surrounding Python
namespace.</p><p>The combination of an attribute name from TAL (which tells
Zope how to handle the surrounding tag) and an attribute value from
TALES (which tells Zope what value to use in this TAL expression)
gives us amazing flexibility in building page templates. In
addition, the fact that TAL and TALES are published and have
open-source specifications means that you can add to them if you
have specific needs that they don't cover.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6ace8"></a>Some Simple Examples</h2></div></div><p>Now that we've discussed the theory behind ZPT, let's look at
some examples. The first example is the skeleton document that Zope
creates when we start a new page template. To do this, go to the
/manage URL on your Zope server, and choose page template from the
Add product list in the upper right-hand corner. (If you don't see
page template on the menu, it could be that ZPT is not an installed
product. You may have to upgrade your copy of Zope to a more modern
version in order to use ZPT.) As is usual in the Zope world, you
will then be asked to enter an ID (i.e., a unique character string
that will appear in the URL) for this new product. Enter a short
name and click &ldquo;Add and edit&rdquo;.</p><p>When you follow these instructions for a DTML document or
method, you are brought to an editing screen that contains skeleton
DTML. The same is true for a page template, except that the
skeleton document obviously contains TAL and TALES
expressions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title tal:content="template/title"&gt;
      The title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span tal:replace="here/title_or_id"&gt;
          content title or id&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span tal:condition="template/title"
               tal:replace="template/title"&gt;
               optional template id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
     This is Page Template
     &lt;em tal:content="template/id"&gt;template id&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>This document might be short, but it effectively displays TAL
and TALES and how they might be used in actual documents. Here are
the TAL attributes that this skeleton uses:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The tal:content attribute replaces the contents of
the tag with the value of the TALES expression. So in this example
document, the words &ldquo;The title&rdquo; will be replaced by the value of
the TALES expression template/title, which we will discuss below.
The &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; tags, along with their
attributes, are left alone, but the text between these tags is
changed when the template is presented by Zope.</p></li><li><p>The tal:replace attribute is similar to
tal:content, except that it replaces the content and the
surrounding tags. This is frequently used with the &lt;span&gt;
tag, which is largely used as a placeholder for such markup in any
event. Thus everything from the first &lt;span&gt; tag to the first
&lt;/span&gt; tag, including the tags themselves, will be replaced
by the value of the TALES expression here/title_or_id.</p></li><li><p>The tal:condition attribute only displays its
contents if its value is a true value, which is anything other than
0, the empty string, an empty list or the built-in ZPT &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;
variable.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>You might notice that the second &lt;span&gt; tag contains
two TAL attributes, tal:condition and tal:replace. When Zope
encounters multiple TAL attributes in a given tag, it first
evaluates definitions, then conditions, then repeat loops, then
content and replace tags. (You cannot have both content and replace
attributes in the same tag, because they are mutually exclusive.)
In the second &lt;span&gt; tag, Zope inserts the optional template
ID only if the template/title TALES expression is true.</p><p>In addition to content, replace and condition, TAL defines
three other attributes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>tal:repeat allows us to loop over a list of items.
If your template will display a list of search results, rows from a
database or files in a folder, then you can loop over the contents
and display the contents in a variety of ways.</p></li><li><p>tal:attributes allows us to replace (or add to) an
attribute of the enclosing tag. For example, we can set the href
attribute of an anchor (&lt;a&gt;) tag at runtime by adding a
tal:attributes attribute in that &lt;a&gt; tag. The value of the
TALES expression will be used to set that attribute when it is
evaluated at runtime.</p></li><li><p>tal:define allows you to set a new variable, which
is then accessible from within enclosed tags. This variable value
can be passed either along to other TAL tags or displayed.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6b478"></a>TALES</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have covered TAL, let's look at the TALES
expressions that we can assign to a TAL attribute.</p><p>The simplest sort of TALES expression is a &ldquo;path
expression&rdquo;, which describes a Zope object relative to the
template, its container or the request. Path expressions are
similar to URLs, except that they begin with a name rather than the
root object /. The final element of the path expression typically
will be a property that can be displayed (using tal:content),
tested (using tal:condition) or iterated over (using
tal:repeat).</p><p>The ZPT skeleton document uses four TALES path
expressions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>here/title_or_id, which returns the value of the
optional &ldquo;title&rdquo; property (if it exists) or the mandatory &ldquo;id&rdquo;
property (if there is no title) to a tal:replace attribute.</p></li><li><p>template/title, which returns the (optional) title
of the current template to tal:condition followed by
tal:replace.</p></li><li><p>template/id, which returns the &ldquo;id&rdquo; property of
the current template.</p></li></ul></div><p>A TALES path expression that begins with &ldquo;template&rdquo; refers
to the template object itself, while one that begins with &ldquo;here&rdquo;
refers to the object to which the template is being applied&mdash;it may
be the template itself or another object entirely. Some other
relative markers are &ldquo;request&rdquo; (the Zope HTTP request object),
&ldquo;repeat&rdquo; (information about current tal:repeat loops),
&ldquo;options&rdquo; (for the parameters passed to the template) and
&ldquo;container&rdquo; (for the folder of the current object).</p><p>TALES path expressions are great but are not as flexible as
we might sometimes need. TALES thus allows you to return Python
code by beginning your TALES expression with &ldquo;python:&rdquo;. For
example, we can include the result of a simple calculation in a
template with the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;p&gt;2 + 2 = &lt;span tal:replace="python:2+2"&gt;
            number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre><p>There is also a &ldquo;string:&rdquo; TALES prefix that indicates that
the value should be treated as a text string. String expressions
may contain interpolated variable values by prefixing the variable
name with $, as in Perl and shell scripts. You may optionally
surround the variable name with curly braces ({ and }), as in ${x}.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6b9f8"></a>Standard Look and Feel</h2></div></div><p>What we have seen so far is very nice for dynamic content
generation. But one of the best things about DTML (or any other
sophisticated server-side macro language) is the ability to define
menus in one document, headers in a second and footers in a third,
and then for each page to import them as necessary.</p><p>One way to handle this situation is to create three separate
templates (menu, header and footer) in the current folder,
importing them with TAL expressions such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;span tal:replace="container/menu"&gt;
 menu goes here&lt;/span&gt;
</pre><p>TALES looks at the current template's container, retrieves
the menu object (which happens to be a page template itself) and
inserts its contents into the current document in place of the
&lt;span&gt; tag.
</p><p>Another way to approach DTML's flexibility is with the use of
macros. Macros are common in many programming languages and allow
us to create functionality that expands at runtime. The ZPT macro
language is called METAL, and like TAL and TALES, it is defined and
invoked within HTML attributes, placed in the &ldquo;metal:&rdquo; XML
namespace. METAL macros can define &ldquo;slots&rdquo;, or parameters, into
which parameter values can be bound. It's easy to imagine how you
could create a macro that handles the overall site design, with
each document fitting into the slot that this macro provides.
Changing the macro definition would effectively change the design
of the entire site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1972580.0x1a6bc60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>When I first heard about ZPT, I was sure that it was yet
another new way to create templates that are incompatible with
other techniques and technologies. But over time, I have become
convinced that ZPT is indeed a clever and elegant idea, and one
that offers advantages to developers and designers alike. Although
it is not a complete replacement for DTML, I believe that most of
my DTML usage can now be replaced by a combination of TAL, TALES
and METAL. I look forward to seeing how these technologies improve
over time and how they are integrated more fully into Zope in the
coming months and years.</p><p><a href="5950s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
