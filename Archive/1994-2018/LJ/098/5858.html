    Using Python and the Mediator pattern to make dialog boxes

I'm a newbie to Linux, having moved into a UNIX environment when I
changed jobs almost two years ago. Before that I was an embedded
systems programmer who worked primarily in a Windows environment.
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I'd like to say the
UNIX/Linux philosophy has been steadily winning me over. In
addition to learning this amazing OS, I've had the opportunity to
be exposed to the Python language. Not only do I find Python to be
a powerful and expressive tool, but with the addition of wxPython
as a GUI extension, I won't be going back to programming the Win32
API.
</p><p>One of the things I did regularly in my GUI work was develop
dialog boxes. Part of my design goal was to make the controls on
the dialog boxes interactive, so the behavior of the controls would
help my users get their work done. You've probably seen
applications that do this, where one or more controls will change
state depending on the state of some other control. This kind of
interaction can be created by placing code in the event handlers of
these controls. However, you'll end up writing a great deal of code
in these event handlers to do all of this well. Plus, coding the
interaction into the event handler couples the controls together.
This means they have to know about each other in order to interact.
If your dialog box gets at all complicated, it can lead to a
maintenance nightmare. Just picture all of those controls making
decisions about what their current state means to all the other
controls on the dialog box. Talk about spaghetti code!</p><p>When I was creating this kind of dialog box I could see it
would lead to a mess, so I wanted to decouple the controls from one
another. I also wanted to centralize the interaction code in one
place, so changes would have to be updated in only one place. The
trick was to decide how to do this. One thing I tried, and I'm sure
many others do this as well, was to search the Web to see if anyone
had done something similar. What I found were discussions of design
patterns and, specifically, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Design Patterns:
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></span>, which I
highly recommend to anyone who takes their code seriously. The
examples in the book are based on C++, but the concepts apply to
many OO-based languages, including Python. The pattern we're going
to use as a solution to our dialog box problem is called the
Mediator pattern. This pattern encapsulates the interactions of a
set of objects.</p><p>From an OO point of view, there is one Mediator object
containing all the objects that we want to have interact with one
another; they are called Colleagues. The Colleagues have a weak
reference to the Mediator object and none to each other. The
Mediator has strong reference to the Colleague objects and can
update them directly in order to create the desired behavior for
all Colleague objects. The benefits of this pattern are what we're
looking for; it centralizes the interaction of objects and reduces
the coupling between them.</p><p>The Mediator/Colleague pattern is implemented as an interface
that can build actual class objects. The Mediator interface has a
method called ColleagueChanged(), which is what all Colleagues call
to inform the Mediator that a change has occurred. The Colleague
interface has only one required method, called Changed(), which
each derived object calls to inform the Mediator that a change in
state has occurred. In addition, the Colleague base class has a
public data member called mediator, which is a reference to the
Mediator object that contains it.</p><p>All of that's very nice, but how do we actually implement a
dialog box that uses the Mediator/Colleague pattern? We'll do this
using Python's OO features and using wxPython as the GUI interface
for a window. First things first, though; let's create a Mediator
base class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Mediator:
   def __init__(self):
       pass
   def ColleagueChanged(self, control, event):
       self._ColleagueChanged(control, event)
   def _ColleagueChanged(self, control, event):
                pass
</pre><p>In this example the Mediator class is implemented as a
Template pattern. This pattern allows us to separate the interface
and implementation of the class. Users of this class call the
CreateColleagues() method but override the _CreateColleagues()
method in their derived classes. I won't discuss the Template
pattern further, but it's another very useful pattern to know.
</p><p>Now let's create our Colleague base class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Colleague:
   def __init__(self, mediator):
       self.mediator = mediator
   def Changed(self, colleague, event):
       self._Changed(colleague, event)
   def _Changed(self, colleague, event):
       self.mediator.ColleagueChanged(colleague, event)
</pre><p>The Colleague base class is also implemented as a Template
pattern. As before, users call the Changed() method but override
the _Changed() method, if necessary. In addition, the Colleague has
a data member, self.mediator, which is a reference to the
containing Mediator instance. This reference is passed into the
constructor of the Colleague.
</p><p>Since our example program is intended to show the utility of
the Mediator/Colleague pattern, it's somewhat contrived. To make
the example a little simpler I've based the one window of the
example on wxFrame from the wxPython library, rather than wxDialog.
Otherwise, the code is the same. Because our example program uses
wxFrame as the container of the controls, it's the logical choice
to be the Mediator. In order to give wxFrame the interface of the
Mediator class, we'll create a new class MainFrame that looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class MainFrame(wxFrame, Mediator):
 def __init__(self, parent, ID, title):
   wxFrame.__init__(self, parent, ID, title,
   wxDefaultPosition, wxSize(400, 300))
   Mediator.__init__(self)
</pre><p>In this code we've created a new class, MainFrame, that
inherits from both wxFrame and Mediator base classes. For this to
work in Python we have to call explicitly the constructor of both
the parent classes. This call is made in the __init__() method of
the MainFrame class.
</p><p>In order for our MainFrame class to interact with its
controls as Colleagues, those controls have to be derived from the
Colleague base class. As an example, let's create a text control
that is also a Colleague object. We do this by creating a new
class, myTextCtrl, that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class myTextCtrl(wxTextCtrl, Colleague):
   def __init__(self, mediator, *_args, **_kwargs):
       apply(wxTextCtrl.__init__, (self,) + _args,
             _kwargs)
       Colleague.__init__(self, mediator)
</pre><p>Here we've created a new class that inherits from both
wxTextCtrl and Colleague base classes. Again, in order for this to
work in Python we have to call explicitly the constructor of both
the parent classes. This is done in the __init__() method of
myTextCtrl. In order to get all the optional parameters of the
wxTextCtrl class properly passed to its constructor, I'll use the
apply() function to call its __init__() method and pass in the
parameters. The __init__() method of the Colleague base class is
called directly, passing mediator as a parameter.
</p><p>Now we have a class that is both a Colleague and a
wxTextCtrl. An instance of this class will receive all the events
generated by a wxTextCtrl and also has the behavior of the
Colleague class. When an event occurs that our MainFrame object
cares about, the event handler calls the Changed() method and
passes the self reference and the event as parameters. As defined
in the Colleague class, the Changed() method calls the
ColleagueChanged() method of the control's Mediator reference. In
this way the MainFrame object (which is a Mediator object) is
informed of all changes occurring in its contained controls.</p><p>So how do we tie all this together in our MainFrame window?
First, as we did with myTextCtrl, we must create derived classes of
all the controls that will interact on our window that also derive
from the Colleague base class. Then, as in most wxPython windows,
we must create our controls in the window's constructor; in this
case MainFrame's __init__() method. Each time a control is created,
MainFrame passes itself as a parameter to the derived control.
You'll see this in the complete example program that accompanies
this article [available at
<a href="../listings/098/5858.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue98/5858.tgz</a>].
Don't be dismayed by the amount of code in the MainFrame.__init__()
method; a great deal of it calls layout functionality provided by
wxPython and is not strictly necessary for our example. It just
makes it look nicer.</p><p>One thing you should notice I've done in the
MainFrame.__init__() method is create a dictionary object called
self.__colleagueMap. I've placed sets of key/value pairs into this
dictionary consisting of a reference to the created Colleague
controls and a method of the MainFrame class. I've done this
because Python does not have a switch/case construct like C/C++
has. This dictionary provides an elegant mechanism to call the
correct method whenever a Colleague object has changed, without
resorting to a lengthy if/elseif construct. You'll see this in the
example program in the implementation of the _ColleagueChanged()
method, as shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def _ColleagueChanged(self, colleague, event):
   if self.__inProcess != true:
      self.__inProcess = true
          if self.__colleagueMap.has_key(colleague):
                self.__colleagueMap[colleague](event)
      self.__inProcess = false
</pre><p>In this code the parameter, colleague, is used as the lookup
into the dictionary. If the colleague exists as a key, then the
corresponding method is called and the event is passed as a
parameter. This is a very slick way to implement a multiway branch
like the switch/case construct.
</p><p>Now our Mediator and Colleague objects exist and are
connected together. The Mediator object (MainFrame) will be
notified of any relevant event generated by a Colleague object
(control). So what's left to do? We have to provide the centralized
code that will create the desired interaction between our controls.
This work is done in the methods we've placed into the
self.__colleagueMap dictionary. Into each method we place the code
that reacts to that controls event. Since these methods are part of
our Mediator (MainFrame) object, they know about and have access to
all other controls on the window.</p><p>The example program has been tested under Python versions 2.1
and 2.2, along with their respective wxPython versions. When the
example program is run you should see a window open up that looks
like the one pictured in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5858f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mediator Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>The interaction on the displayed window involves most of the
controls. When you type a character in the text box, the program
does some simple speed selection and highlights the first entry in
the list box that matches. In addition, the Select and Clear
buttons become enabled. If you select either a city or state, the
complementary selection is made in the other list box. If you
select a different region with the radio buttons, that action
re-initializes the lists boxes, clears the text box and disables
the Select and Clear buttons. Clicking on the Clear button alone
clears the text box and disables itself. All of the interaction
code is in the MainFrame class, and the controls are not coupled to
one another.</p><p>Our wxFrame window doesn't do anything very useful, but it
does demonstrate how the Mediator pattern can orchestrate the
behavior of controls on a window. The real payoff for this effort
comes when you apply this pattern to a more involved dialog box,
where the interaction complexity can grow at a shocking rate. To
manage it, all we have to do is add another control that is derived
from the Colleague class and add the corresponding interaction code
to our ColleagueChanged() method, and the complexity is
handled.</p></div></div>
