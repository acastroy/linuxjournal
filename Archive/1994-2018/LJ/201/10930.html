<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #201, January 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the ongoing saga of <span   class="bold"><b>big-kernel-lock</b></span> removal, we seem to be getting
very, very close to having no more BKL. Its remaining users in the
linux-next tree seem to be down to less than 20, and most of those are in old
code that has no current maintainer to take care of it. Filesystem
code, networking code and a couple drivers are all that remain of
the once ubiquitous big kernel lock. <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd
Bergmann</b></span> has posted a
complete list of offending code, and a large group of developers have
piled on top of it.
</p><p>
The truly brilliant part of ditching the BKL is that a lot of people
felt completely stymied by it for a long time. It was absolutely
everywhere, and there didn't seem to be any viable alternative. Then
the wonderful decision was made to push all the occurrences of the big
kernel lock out to the periphery of the kernel&mdash;in other words, out to
where only one thing would depend on any particular instance. Before
that decision, the BKL was deep in the interior, where any given
instance of it would be relied on by whole regions of code, each
relying on different aspects of it. By pushing it out to the
periphery, all of a sudden it became clear which features of the BKL
were actually necessary for which of its various users.
</p><p>
As it turned out, most BKL users could make do with a much simpler
locking structure, although a few had more complex needs. But, that whole
period of time is really cool, because the problem went from being
super-intractable, to being pretty well tractable, and by now, it's
almost tracted right out of existence.
</p><p>
If you do any kernel development, you'll notice the <span   class="bold"><b>LKML-Reference</b></span>
tag in every git patch submission, but it might not make total sense
to you in this age of on-line e-mail clients, if you haven't read
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc5322.html" target="_self">www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc5322.html</a> lately. Recently, it came up on
<span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel</b></span>, that maybe the LKML-Reference tag should just be a URL
linking to the linux-kernel post corresponding to that git submission,
as stored in any one of many linux-kernel Web archives. But, as several
folks pointed out at the time, URLs come and go. Message-ID headers
are eternal.
</p><p>
In the old days, the question of which <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span> version to support was
largely a question of which GCC version managed to piss off <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>. Back then, the question tended to be, &ldquo;How long can we keep
compiling with this extremely old version of GCC, now that the GCC
developers have implemented this weird behavior we don't like?&rdquo;
Nowadays, the question is more along the lines of, &ldquo;How soon can we
stop supporting kernel compilations under this very old version of GCC
that is quirky and requires us to maintain weird stuff in the
kernel?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The question came up recently of whether it would be okay to stop
supporting the 3.3 and 3.4 versions of GCC. It turns out that even
though GCC 3.3.3 has problems that make it not work right with the
latest kernels, certain distributions ship with a patched version that
they also call GCC 3.3.3. So, any attempt to alert users to the
potential breakage would cause only further confusion. Meanwhile, GCC
3.4 apparently is being used by most embedded systems developers, for
whatever reason. And, GCC 3.4 also is a lot faster on ARM architectures
than more recent versions of GCC are. So for the moment at least, it
seems that those are the oldest versions of GCC still supported for
kernel compiling. You also can use more recent GCC versions if you
like.

Some tools are so amazing, but unfortunately, if no one ever talks about them, many folks never hear
of them. One of those programs is BackupPC. You may have heard Kyle
Rankin and myself talk about BackupPC on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Insider
podcast, or perhaps you've seen us write about it here in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
before. If you haven't checked it out, you owe it to yourself to do so.
BackupPC has some great features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hard drive-based backups, no tape swapping.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for NFS, SSH, SMB and rsync.
</p></li><li><p>
Hard linking to save valuable disk space.
</p></li><li><p>
Individual files can be restored in place in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
Powerful and simple Web interface.
</p></li><li><p>
E-mail notification on errors.
</p></li><li><p>
Free!
</p></li></ul></div><p>
BackupPC is one of those projects that doesn't get updated terribly
often. It doesn't have flashy graphics. It doesn't require
constant maintenance. It just works, and it works well. Check it out:

There may be a battle in the Linux world regarding what instant-messaging
client is the best (Pidgin or Empathy), but in the OS X world, the battle
never really started. Adium is an OS X-native, open-source application
based on the libpurple library. Although there is a native Pidgin client
for OS X, it's not nearly as polished and stable as Adium. With Apple's
reputation for solid, elegant programs, the Open Source community really
showed it up with this answer to Apple's iChat program. Adium wins
on multiple levels, and its source code is as close as a click away.
If you ever use OS X and want to try some quality open-source
goodness running on the &ldquo;other&rdquo; proprietary operating system, check

<h2 class="title">Linux for Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #201, January 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Welcome to a new series of short articles on using Linux and open-source
software for science. The tools available for free (as in beer) have lowered the cost
of participating in computational science. The freedom (as in speech)
you have when using these tools allows you to build upon the work of
others, advancing the level of knowledge for everyone.
</p><p>
In this series, I'll look at some small science
experiments anyone can do at home, and then consider some tool or
other available on Linux that you can use to analyze the results. In some
purely theoretical spheres (like quantum chemistry or general relativity),
I'll just look at the tool alone and how to use it without the benefit of
an accompanying experiment.
</p><p>
The first experiment is a classic&mdash;the simple pendulum (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum</a>). When
you look at a simple pendulum, there are two obvious parameters you
can change: the mass of the pendulum bob and the length of the string. A
simple way to do this at home is to use a bolt with nuts. You can tie
a string to the head of a bolt and tie the other end to a pivot point,
like a shower-curtain rod. Then, you simply can add more weight by adding
nuts to the bolt. This is the basic experimental setup for this article.
</p><p>
The data to collect is the time it takes for each oscillation
(one full back-and-forth motion). Because you will want to figure out which
parameters affect the pendulum, you'll need to do this for several
different masses and lengths. To help get consistent
times, let's actually time how long it takes for ten oscillations.
To average out any reaction time issues in the time taking, let's do
three of these measurements and take the average. You should end up with
something like Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x29d3580.0x2acb3e0"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Pendulum Data</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1.

Now that you have the data, what can you learn from it? To do some basic
analysis, let's look at Scilab (<a href="http://www.scilab.org" target="_self">www.scilab.org</a>). This
is a MATLAB-like application that can be used for data analysis and
graphing. Installing on Ubuntu, or other Debian-based distributions, is as
simple as:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install scilab
</pre>
</p><p>
On startup, you should see something like Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10930pendulumf1.large.jpg"><img src="10930pendulumf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Scilab Startup
</p></div></div><p>
Usually, the first thing you'll want to do is graph your data
to see whether any correlations jump out at you. To do that, you
need to get your data into Scilab. The most natural format is 
three vectors (length, mass and time), with one row for each measurement
you
made. In Scilab, this would look like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
height = [18.8, 18.8, 18.8, 18.8,
          37.6, 37.6, 37.6, 37.6,
          57.6, 57.6, 57.6, 57.6,
          88.8, 88.8, 88.8, 88.8];
weight = [102.0, 118.5, 135.0, 151.5,
          102.0, 118.5, 135.0, 151.5,
          102.0, 118.5, 135.0, 151.5,
          102.0, 118.5, 135.0, 151.5];
times = [0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9,
         1.3, 1.3, 1.3, 1.3,
         1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5,
         1.9, 1.9, 1.9, 1.9];
</pre>
</p><p>
You probably will want to use this data over and over again, doing
different types of analysis. To do this most simply, you can store these
lines in a separate file and load it into your Scilab environment when
you want to use it. You just need to call exec() to load and run these
variable assignments. For this example, load the data with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exec("~/pendulum1.sce");
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see individual elements of this data using the disp() function. To
see the first value in the times vector, you would use
what's shown in Figure 2. To do a simple 2-D plot, say, of height vs. times,
simply execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot(height, times);
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10930pendulumf2.large.jpg"><img src="10930pendulumf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. First Value in the Times Vector
</p></div></div><p>
This doesn't look very descriptive, so let's add some text to explain what
this graph shows. You can set labels and titles for your graph with
the xtitle command:

   
<pre     class="programlisting">
xtitle("Pendulum Height vs Time", "Height(cm)", Time(s)");
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces a graph that looks like Figure 3. But,
you have three pieces of data, or three dimensions. If you want to produce a
3-D graph, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
surf(height, weight, times);
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10930pendulumf3.large.jpg"><img src="10930pendulumf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Pendulum Height vs. Time
</p></div></div><p>
This produces a surface plot of the data. Because this experiment seems so
clear, you won't actually need a full 3-D plot.
</p><p>
All of this data visualization points to weight not really having any
influence on time. So, let's focus on the relationship between the
length of the pendulum and the time. The graph looks like an almost
straight line, so let's assume that it is and see where we get with it. The
formula for a straight line is y=a+bx. The typical thing to do is to try to
fit a &ldquo;closest&rdquo; straight line to the data you have. The term for this is
linear regression. Luckily, Scilab has a function for this called
regress(). In this case, simply execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
coeffs = regress(height, times);
disp(coeffs(1));
disp(coeffs(2));
</pre>
</p><p>
This ends up looking like Figure 4. From this, you can see that
the slope of the straight line you just fit to your data is 0.0137626 s/cm.
Does this make sense? Let's look at some theory to check out that
number.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10930pendulumf4.large.jpg"><img src="10930pendulumf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Using Scilab's regress() Function
</p></div></div><p>
According to theory, you should have plotted the square of the time
values against the length of the pendulum. To get the square of the time
values, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
timess = times .* times;
</pre>
</p><p>
This multiplies the first entry of the time vector to itself, the second
entry to itself (and so on), down the entire vector. So, the new vector timess
contains the square of each entry in the vector times. If you now do a
linear regression with timess instead of times, you get the following result:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a = 0.1081958
b = 0.0390888
</pre>
</p><p>
According to theory, the value of a should be given by ((2 *
PI)<sup  >2</sup> / g),
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. According to Scilab, the value
is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ans = (2 * 3.14159)^2 / (9.81 * 100);
disp(ans);
</pre>
</p><p>
You need to adjust the value of g by a factor of 100 to change it to the
correct units of cm, and this gives you 0.0402430. To the second
decimal place, this gives you 0.04 from the experiment and 0.04 from theory. What
does this look like graphically? You can generate the two graphs with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
plot(height, timess);
plot(height, 0.1081958 + 0.0390888*height);
xtitle("Simple Pendulum", "Length (cm)", "Times Squared (s^2)");
</pre>
</p><p>
This looks like Figure 5. It seems like a reasonably
close match, considering that the spread of measured pendulum lengths 
covers only 70cm. If you made measurements with pendulum lengths over a larger
range of values, you likely will see an even closer match to theory. But, as
an easy example experiment to show a small list of Scilab functions, you've
already seen that simple pendulums seem to follow theory reasonably
well.

Next month, I'll introduce Maxima and take a
look at the math behind the theory of the simple pendulum, seeing whether I can
derive the usual results as taught in introductory physics.

I love Pandora Radio. I really do. Unfortunately, the Web browser
is an awkward interface for listening. Oh sure, it's effective and
works fine. But, it's missing things like media key support, and if
you accidentally close your browser window, BOOM&mdash;no music.
</p><p>
Enter Pithos. With a very simplistic interface, Pithos doesn't do much,
but what it does, it does very well&mdash;plays Pandora Radio. If your
keyboard has multimedia keys, you'll appreciate Pithos' media key
support as well. If your phone rings, simply press the pause button on
your keyboard to pause the music regardless of whether the application
has focus.

Canonical has quite a cloud service going with Ubuntu One. It syncs
files, music, preferences, contacts and many more things.
But, it's only partially free, and the server is completely private and
proprietary. The philosophy of keeping the server bits completely closed
turns off many of us in the Open Source community. Yes, Canonical has
every right to develop Ubuntu One as it sees fit, but as users, we also
have the right to look elsewhere. Enter Snowy. No, it's not an all-encompassing replacement for Ubuntu One, but Snowy is designed as a free
(in both senses) syncing solution for Tomboy Notes.
</p><p>
If you want to access your Tomboy Notes on-line as well as from several
computers while keeping them all in sync, keep your eye on Snowy.
The developers hope to get a free syncing service on-line,
powered by Snowy, by the time Gnome 3.0 launches. Of course, you 
also can download Snowy yourself and host your notes on your own server,
which is exactly what we hoped Ubuntu One would be when we first heard
about it. Check out the progress at <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Snowy" target="_self">live.gnome.org/Snowy</a>.
