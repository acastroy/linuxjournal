The current state of SOGo and its integration capabilities with
desktop and mobile clients.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1be62a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More than two years have passed since I last wrote about SOGo for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. Since
then, the project has matured greatly and now is being used successfully
in tons of large-scale deployments. SOGo's strengths are really about
scalability; component re-usability (IMAP, LDAP, SMTP and database
server); compliance to standards, such as CalDAV and CardDAV; and excellent
interoperability with popular applications, such as Mozilla Thunderbird,
Apple iCal/Address Book and Microsoft Outlook. The latter is supported
through a close collaboration between the SOGo and OpenChange Projects.
</p><p>
Since my last article, there have been more fluctuations in the
world of open-source groupware, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
CalDAV and CardDAV protocols have gained major popularity, and extensions,
such as Collection Synchronization for WebDAV and CalDAV Scheduling Extensions
to WebDAV, are making those finally usable in large-scale enterprise
environments.
</p></li><li><p>
Mozilla Messaging finally released Thunderbird 3 with a greatly improved
Mozilla Lightning extension.
</p></li><li><p>
Zimbra gained tons of popularity, but Yahoo sold it to VMware for a major
loss.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenGroupware.org, Open-Xchange, Citadel, Kolab, eGroupWare and Bedework
are fading away.
</p></li><li><p>
Chandler and Bongo virtually died.
</p></li><li><p>
Apple is actively integrating open standards in its calendar and address-book applications.
</p></li><li><p>
DAViCal and OpenChange have emerged as great solutions to consider.
</p></li><li><p>
Funambol has positioned itself as the favorite synchronization middleware.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The first incarnation of SOGo appeared with v1.0
in March 2009, and versions up to 1.3.2 quickly followed. This article
presents the current state of SOGo, its integration capabilities with
desktop and mobile clients and provides simple instructions to 
get a workable installation quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1be6b40"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing SOGo is very easy, as packages are available for a variety of
GNU/Linux-based distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise (and CentOS),
Debian and Ubuntu. An Ubuntu-based virtual appliance also is available,
which provides a complete out-of-the-box testing environment of SOGo. 
Here, I provide high-level installation and configuration
instructions. For more in-depth instructions, look at the official
SOGo documentation, which covers everything, including instructions for
desktop clients and mobile devices.
</p><p>
SOGo leverages virtually every part of your
infrastructure. It makes
use of the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Your LDAP server for authentication, public address books and groups
extraction.
</p></li><li><p>
Your database server to store events, tasks and contacts. A database
server also can be used for authentication and shared address books.
MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL are supported.
</p></li><li><p>
Your IMAP server to store/retrieve e-mail. When available, SOGo also
makes use of advanced capabilities, such as IMAP ACLs, Sieve, shared
folders and more.
</p></li><li><p>
Your SMTP server to send e-mail.
</p></li><li><p>
Your HTTP server to proxy requests to the SOGo server and perform
SSL encryption.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, when you do not have such components in your environment,
best-of-breed ones can be used from the free and Open Source community.
SOGo
will literally transform those loosely coupled components into a single
and coherent groupware solution, which then can be accessed from your
favorite Web browser or from a variety of desktop and mobile
clients.
</p><p>
Assuming you have an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS installation and you prefer MySQL,
let's proceed with the installation of SOGo and its dependencies. First, add
SOGo's repository to your APT sources list, and resynchronize the package
index files from their sources:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo su -
% echo 'deb http://inverse.ca/ubuntu lucid main' 
  &#8618;&gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
% apt-get update 
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, install SOGo, its dependencies, Apache and MySQL:


<pre     class="programlisting">
% apt-get install sogo sope4.9-gdl1-mysql apache2 mysql-server 
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get Apache startup errors after the installation, ignore them. Next,
create the SOGo database and the required user:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql -h localhost -u root -p
mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE sogo CHARSET='UTF8';
mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'sogo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sogo.* TO 'sogo'@'localhost';
</pre>
</p><p>
SOGo's database will be used to store events, tasks, contacts and user
preferences. To keep this installation as simple as possible, let's
also use MySQL for user authentication. To make this work, create a
database table holding user information, and add three test users all with
the same MD5-encrypted password (&ldquo;secret&rdquo;):


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; USE sogo;
mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE sogo_users (c_uid VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY, 
 &#8618;c_name VARCHAR(10), c_password VARCHAR(32), 
 &#8618;c_cn VARCHAR(128), mail VARCHAR(128));
mysql&gt; INSERT INTO sogo_users VALUES ('alice', 'alice', 
 &#8618;MD5('secret'), 'Alice Thompson', 'alice@acme.com');
mysql&gt; INSERT INTO sogo_users VALUES ('bob', 'bob', MD5('secret'), 
 &#8618;'Bob Smith', 'bob@acme.com');
mysql&gt; INSERT INTO sogo_users VALUES ('chris', 'chris', MD5('secret'), 
 &#8618;'Chris Cooper', 'chris@acme.com');
</pre>
</p><p>
In a read-world environment, your database table probably would be
much more complex than that. It also might be a database view on your
existing information, and in many cases, an LDAP server will be
used for authentication and user information retrieval instead. SOGo supports
multiple authentication sources, so you also could have an LDAP server
for authentication used together with an SQL view on your CRM contacts
that would be exposed as an address book to all your SOGo users.
</p><p>
Next, let Apache proxy requests to SOGo. Because SOGo is not a
fully compliant HTTP server, you should use Apache (or any other HTTP
server) in front of it by enabling some required modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% a2enmod proxy
% a2enmod proxy_http
% a2enmod headers
</pre>
</p><p>
Once enabled, you must configure SOGo so that it uses your newly created MySQL
database. Again, in this example, let's not configure the Web mail part
of SOGo to keep the configuration as simple as possible. Nonetheless,
if you do have a working IMAP server installation (Cyrus IMAP Server
and Dovecot are recommended), it will work out of the box if SOGo and
your IMAP server use the same authentication source.
</p><p>
Proceed with SOGo's configuration under the &ldquo;sogo&rdquo; user. This is very
important as the sogod d&aelig;mon will run under the sogo user, so the
preferences created by the defaults utility must belong to the sogo
user:


<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo su - sogo
% defaults write sogod SOGoTimeZone "America/Montreal"
% defaults write sogod SOGoMailDomain "acme.com"
% defaults write sogod SOGoLanguage English 
% defaults write sogod SOGoUserSources '({canAuthenticate = YES; 
 &#8618;displayName = "SOGo Users"; id = users; isAddressBook = YES; 
 &#8618;type = sql; userPasswordAlgorithm = md5; viewURL = 
 &#8618;"mysql://sogo:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/sogo/sogo_users";})'
% defaults write sogod SOGoProfileURL 
 &#8618;'mysql://root:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/sogo/sogo_user_profile'
% defaults write sogod OCSFolderInfoURL 
 &#8618;'mysql://root:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/sogo/sogo_folder_info'
% defaults write sogod SOGoAppointmentSendEMailNotifications NO
% defaults write sogod SOGoLoginModule Calendar
% exit
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, modify the /etc/apache2/conf.d/SOGo.conf configuration file to
use localhost with no SSL. So replace the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-port" "443"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-name" "yourhostname"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-url" "https://yourhostname"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1be7900"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-port" "80"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-name" "localhost"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-url" "http://localhost"
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, restart Apache and SOGo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
% /etc/init.d/sogo restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to use an IP address or a real DNS name to access SOGo,
you must adjust this accordingly. The <tt  >"x-webobjects-server-url"</tt> value
will become the official URL to access your SOGo system. Now, from the
same machine on which you performed the above steps, open your favorite Web
browser and access http://localhost/SOGo. You should be able to log in
with any of the three users created above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1be7c18"></a>
Desktop Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Through the standard CalDAV and CardDAV protocols, SOGo supports desktop
clients, such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple iCal and Apple Address Book,
very well.
</p><p>
Mozilla Thunderbird, combined with the Lightning calendar extension, is
the preferred client to use with SOGo. Version 2 and 3.1 of Thunderbird
are supported. Thunderbird is the preferred desktop client as SOGo's
Web interface shares most of its look and feel and functionality
with Thunderbird. Moreover, two extensions can be
installed together with Lightning to perfect the integration:
the SOGo Connector and SOGo Integrator extensions. The former adds
more capabilities to Thunderbird (such as CardDAV support, CalDAV ACL and so on), and
the latter adds features that are vertical to SOGo (such as
calendars, address-book sharing capabilities and automatic discovery,
preferences synchronization and more).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10894f1.large.jpg"><img src="10894f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Mozilla Thunderbird
</p></div></div><p>
Using the SOGo Integrator extension requires editing one file in the
extension file subtree to specify where the SOGo server is located. This
is done by hand. In an enterprise environment, this step is 
required only once per release, because the updates are expected to propagate
automatically. Uncompress (using a ZIP or jar tool) the SOGo Integrator
XPI, and locate the extensions.rdf file. This file is used for locating the
extension update server and the SOGo server (let's consider those to be the
same for the moment). There is a line starting with a <tt  >Seq</tt> tag and with an
attribute named <tt  >isi:updateURL</tt>. Replace the host part of that URL with
the SOGo server to which you want to connect, which again should be identical
to the <tt  >x-webobjects-server-url</tt>. For example, one would replace
the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Seq about="http://inverse.ca/sogo-integrator/extensions" 
 &#8618;isi:updateURL="http://sogo-demo.inverse.ca/plugins/
&#8618;updates.php?plugin=%ITEM_ID%&amp;version=%ITEM_VERSION%&amp;
&#8618;platform=%PLATFORM%"&gt;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1fe05a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Seq about="http://inverse.ca/sogo-integrator/extensions" 
 &#8618;isi:updateURL="https://sogo.acme.com/plugins/
&#8618;updates.php?plugin=%ITEM_ID%&amp;version=%ITEM_VERSION%&amp;
&#8618;platform=%PLATFORM%"&gt;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1fe0700"></a></h2></div></div><p>
if the SOGo server is accessible from https://sogo.acme.com/SOGo. Once
you are done modifying the configuration file, save your changes and
reconstruct the XPI. As for the extension update server, it can be
configured to install or uninstall Mozilla Thunderbird
extensions automatically. You also can push Thunderbird settings to all your user
base. Installation and configuration is documented in the &ldquo;Mozilla
Thunderbird&mdash;Installation and Configuration Guide&rdquo;.
</p><p>
On Mac OS X, if you prefer Apple's closed-source applications, you
easily can use Apple iCal 3 and iCal 4 with SOGo. All features will
be available, including calendar sharing and delegation, due to SOGo's
excellent compatibility with the CalDAV protocol and its implementation of
some Apple-specific extensions. Since Mac OS X 10.6, it's also possible
to use Address Book with SOGo through the CardDAV protocol in order to
access your contacts. When you combine those two applications with Apple
Mail, a cohesive environment is created with collaboration possibilities
with other users on other platforms.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10894f3.large.jpg"><img src="10894f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Apple iCal 3
</p></div></div><p>
The popularity gained by the CalDAV and CardDAV quickly exposed
fundamental flaws in both protocols, and the Collection Synchronization
for WebDAV and CalDAV Scheduling Extensions to WebDAV were created to
eliminate those. The former introduces a token-based approach to DAV
resources synchronization. So, instead of letting the DAV client ask for
the ETag of every single item in a collection to see what has changed
on the server, the client actually sends a sync token and gets in return
the references of changed items from a collection. This makes the whole
synchronization process of large calendars or address books very fast.
</p><p>
The second extension actually moves all the scheduling logic required in
calendaring applications (inviting attendees, checking availabilities and so on) to the server. This avoids client-side implementation bugs and
reduces client-to-server communications, which can be slow on high-latency
connections.
</p><p>
SOGo implements those two extensions quite nicely, and Mozilla Lightning
supports both while Apple iCal limits itself to CalDAV Scheduling
Extensions to WebDAV.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1fe0b78"></a>
OpenChange Integration</h2></div></div><p>
To provide SOGo connectivity options to Microsoft Outlook users, SOGo
makes use of the OpenChange Project. The project was founded 
in 2003 by Julien Kerihuel in the context of his EPITECH Innovative
Project. Tightly integrated with Samba 4, the OpenChange solution is
divided into three subprojects:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
libmapi: a client-side library that can be used in existing messaging
clients (Evolution, Akonadi, Mailody and so on) and offers native compatibility
with Exchange server.
</p></li><li><p>
mapiproxy: a transparent gateway/proxy used to accelerate the
communication between Outlook clients and an Exchange server.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenChange Server: a full implementation of the Exchange protocols that
features pluggable storage providers.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The third subproject is what really interests us here. SOGo developers
have created a storage provider for OpenChange that makes use of SOGo
libraries in order to reuse all the business logic associated to address
books, calendars and e-mail management. Microsoft Outlook communicates
directly and natively to OpenChange (because it behaves like any Microsoft
Exchange server), which in turn uses the SOGo storage provider to access
all the information SOGo handles.
</p><p>
This makes SOGo a real, transparent Microsoft Exchange replacement, because
it does not force Outlook users to use costly and hard-to-maintain MAPI
connectors, which often are limited in terms of functionality. A proof of
concept was released in October 2010 with many capabilities for e-mail,
contacts, events and tasks. The project is being worked on actively,
and by the time you read this article, a well-working version should be
available for public consumption.
</p><p>
Samba, being vastly popular in numerous organizations and its ambitious
rewrite to become an Active Directory-compatible Domain Controller, might
eventually position a Samba 4, OpenChange and SOGo combo as a turnkey
solution for lots of organizations requiring well-integrated directory
services, file and printing services and a collaboration solution on
top of it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aee580.0x1fe1048"></a>
Mobile Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Web interface or desktop client applications will satisfy most
users, the high popularity of mobile devices, the increasing mobility
of users and the need to access events, tasks, contacts or e-mail from
everywhere can't be neglected by any groupware solution.
</p><p>
Through its Funambol connector, SOGo can synchronize events,
contacts and tasks fully with any SyncML-capable device. The Funambol
Project is composed of a SyncML server and clients for devices with no
built-in SyncML support, such as Research in Motion BlackBerry, Microsoft
Windows Mobile, Symbian S60 or Google Android. The server part, which
is a middleware, can reuse all data from SOGo using the Funambol SOGo
Connector. All those free components enable billions of SyncML-capable
devices to synchronize to the SOGo platform.
</p><p>
The Funambol middleware is a self-contained Java application. Installation
is as easy as downloading Funambol Server, the Funambol SOGo Connector
and creating the sync sources. Full instructions are provided in the
&ldquo;SOGo&mdash;Installation and Configuration Guide&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Apple iPhone users can configure their phones to use CalDAV and CardDAV
and have access to their calendars and address books whenever they
want. On Google Android-based devices, it also is possible to use the
freely available Hypermatix CalDAV client to access calendar information
from SOGo.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10894f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Configuration instructions for mobile devices are available in the

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As discussed in this article, the industry is moving toward open standards,
such as CalDAV and CardDAV, to support collaborative applications, which
SOGo supports well. Hopefully, this trend will continue, if not improve.
</p><p>
The native compatibility SOGo offers to Outlook users using
OpenChange will be a major step in dislodging Microsoft's biggest
enterprise lock-in&mdash;Exchange.
</p><p>
SOGo is not a finished product, and it will continue to
evolve. Developers actively are improving the OpenChange and Exchange
integration, implementing more Apple extensions, such as file attachments
for meetings, as well as adding scripting capabilities to SOGo. The
virtual appliance for SOGo, called ZEG for &ldquo;Zero Effort Groupware&rdquo;,
is a good way to try the sogo application and download it.
