Configure Ethernet bonding and get a license to kill a network interface

As a sysadmin, one of the most important virtues you should foster
is tolerance. Now, although it's important for vi and Emacs users and
GNOME and KDE users to live in harmony, what I want to focus on here is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fault</em></span> tolerance. Everybody has faults, but when your
server's uptime is on the line, you should do everything you can to
make sure it can survive power faults, network faults, hardware faults and
even your faults. In this column, I describe a basic fault-tolerance procedure
that's so simple to implement, all sysadmins should
add it to their servers: Ethernet bonding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb9580.0x10b1618"></a>
Live and Let Interfaces Die</h2></div></div><p>
The basic idea behind Ethernet bonding is to combine two or more
Ethernet ports on your machine, such that if one Ethernet port loses its
connection, another bonded port can take over the traffic with zero or
minimal downtime. The fact is that these days, the bulk of the services
on a server require a network connection to be useful, so if you set up
multiple Ethernet ports that are connected to redundant switches, you can
conceivably survive a NIC failure, a cable failure, a bad switch port
or even a switch failure, and your server will stay up.
</p><p>
On top of basic fault tolerance, you also can use certain Ethernet bonding
modes to provide load balancing as well and get more bandwidth than a
single interface could provide. Ethernet bonding is a feature that is part
of the Linux kernel, and it can provide a number of different behaviors based
on which bonding mode you choose. All of the Ethernet bonding information
can be found in the Documentation/networking/bonding.txt file included
with the Linux kernel source. Below, I provide an excerpt from that
documentation that lists the 007 bonding modes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
balance-rr or 0 &mdash; round-robin policy: transmit packets in sequential order
from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load
balancing and fault tolerance.
</p></li><li><p>
active-backup or 1 &mdash; active-backup policy: only one slave in the bond
is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active
slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one
port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch.
</p></li><li><p>
balance-xor or 2 &mdash;
XOR policy: transmit based on the selected transmit hash policy. The
default policy is a simple [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC
address) modulo slave count]. Alternate transmit policies may be selected
via the xmit_hash_policy option, described below. This mode provides load
balancing and fault tolerance.
</p></li><li><p>
broadcast or 3 &mdash;
broadcast policy: transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode
provides fault tolerance.
</p></li><li><p>
802.3ad or 4 &mdash;
IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation: creates aggregation groups that
share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all slaves in the active
aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.
</p></li><li><p>
balance-tlb or 5 &mdash;
adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any
special switch support. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to
the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each slave. Incoming
traffic is received by the current slave. If the receiving slave fails,
another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving slave.
</p></li><li><p>
balance-alb or 6 &mdash;
adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing
(rlb) for IPv4 traffic and does not require any special switch support.
The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding
driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out
and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address
of one of the slaves in the bond such that different peers use different
hardware addresses for the server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now that you've seen all the choices, the real question is which
bonding mode should you choose? To be honest, that's a difficult
question to answer, because it depends so much on your network and what
you want to accomplish. What I recommend is to set up a test network and
simulate a failure by unplugging a cable while you ping the server from
another host. What I've found is that different modes handle failure
differently, especially in the case of a switch that takes some time
to re-enable a port that has been unplugged or a switch that has been
rebooted. Depending on the bonding mode you choose, those situations
might result in no downtime or a 30-second outage. For my examples in
this column, I chose bonding mode 1 because although it 
provides only fault tolerance, it also has only one port enabled at a time,
so it should be relatively safe to experiment with on most switches.
</p><p>
Note: the bonding mode is set at the time the bonding module is loaded,
so if you want to experiment with different bonding modes, you will at
least have to unload and reload the module or at most reboot the server.
</p><p>
Although Ethernet bonding is accomplished through a kernel module and a
utility called ifenslave, the method you use to configure kernel
module settings and the way networks are configured can differ
between Linux distributions. For this column, I talk about how
to set this up for both Red Hat- and Debian-based distributions, as
that should cover the broadest range of servers. The first step is
to make sure that the ifenslave program is installed. Red Hat servers
should have this program installed already, but on Debian-based systems,
you might need to install the ifenslave package.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb9580.0x10b1e58"></a>
For Your Files Only</h2></div></div><p>
The next step is to configure the bonding module with the bonding mode
you want to use, along with any other options you might want to set for
that module. On a Red Hat system, you will edit either /etc/modprobe.conf
(for a 2.6 kernel) or /etc/modules.conf (for an older 2.4 kernel). On a
Debian-based system, edit or create the /etc/modprobe.d/aliases file. In
either case, add the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias bond0 bonding
options bonding mode=1 miimon=100
</pre>
</p><p>
The alias line will associate the bond0 network interface with the bonding
module. If you intend on having multiple bonded interfaces (such as on
a system with four or more NICs), you will need to add an extra alias line
for bond1 or any other interfaces. The options line allows me to set
my bonding mode to 1 as well as set miimon (how often the kernel will
check the link state of the interface in milliseconds).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb9580.0x10b2010"></a>
On Your Distribution's Network Service</h2></div></div><p>
Like with module configuration, different distributions handle network
configuration quite differently, and that's true for bonded interfaces
as well. So, at this point, it's best if I describe each system separately.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb9580.0x10b2118"></a>
From Red Hat with Love</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat network configuration is managed via files under
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. Each interface has its own configuration
file preceded by ifcfg-, so that the configuration for eth0 can be found
in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. To configure bonding, you
simply can use the basic network settings you would have for your regular
interface, only now they will be found in ifcfg-bond0:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=bond0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.19.1
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.19.64
HOSTNAME=goldfinger.example.net
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, each interface you want to use for bond0 needs to be
configured. In my case, if I wanted to bond eth0 and eth1, I would put
the following into ifcfg-eth0:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=eth0
USERCTL=no
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb9580.0x10b2328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the following into ifcfg-eth1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=eth1
USERCTL=no
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, type <tt  >service network restart</tt> as root to restart your network
service with the new bonded interface. From this point on, you can treat
ifcfg-bond0 as your main configuration file for any network changes (and
files like route-bond0 to configure static routes, for instance). To
make this even easier for you, I've included a script for Red Hat users
that automates this entire process. Run the script with the name of the
bonded interface you want to use (such as bond0), follow it with the
list of interfaces you want to bond, and it will set up
the modules and network interfaces for you automatically based on the configuration
it finds in the first interface (such as eth0) that you list. So, for
instance, to set up the above configuration, I would make sure that
ifcfg-eth0 had the network settings I wanted to use, and then I would run the
script shown in Listing 1.

Debian Is Forever</h2></div></div><p>
As you might imagine, Debian's network configuration is quite different
from Red Hat's. Unfortunately, I don't have a Perl script to automate the
process for Debian users, but as you will see, it's so simple, a script
isn't necessary. All the network configuration for Debian-based servers
can be found in /etc/network/interfaces. Here's a sample interfaces file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.19.64
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.19.1
</pre>
</p><p>
To configure a bonded interface, I simply comment out all of the
configuration settings for eth0 and create a new configuration for bond0
that copies all of eth0's settings. The only change I make is the addition
of an extra parameter called slaves that lists which interfaces should
be used for this bonded interface:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet static
#  address 192.168.19.64
#  netmask 255.255.255.0
#  gateway 192.168.19.1

auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
  address 192.168.19.64
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.19.1
  slaves eth0 eth1
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have made the changes, type <tt  >sudo service networking
restart</tt> or
<tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart</tt> to restart your
network interface.
</p><p>
No matter whether you use Red Hat or Debian, once you have configured
the bonded interface, you can use the ifconfig command to see that it
has been configured:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ifconfig

</pre>
</p><p>
Once the bonded interface is enabled, you can ping the server from
a remote host and test that it fails over when you unplug one of
the Ethernet cables. Any failures should be logged both in dmesg
(/var/log/dmesg) and in the syslog (/var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog)
and would look something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Oct 04 16:43:28 goldfinger kernel: [ 2901.700054] eth0: link down
Oct 04 16:43:29 goldfinger kernel: [ 2901.731190] bonding: bond0:
link status definitely down for interface eth0, disabling it
Oct 04 16:43:29 goldfinger kernel: [ 2901.731300] bonding: bond0:
making interface eth1 the new active one.
</pre>
</p><p>
As I said earlier, I highly recommend you experiment with each bonding
mode and with different types of failures, so you can see how each handles
both failures and recoveries on your network. When your system is more
tolerant of failures, you'll find you are more tolerant of your system.
