Dear readers, I appear to have set a Paranoid Penguin record&mdash;six months
spent on one article series. (It has consisted of five installments, with a
one-month break between the second and third pieces.) But, we've covered a
lot of ground: transparent firewall concepts and design principles; how
to install OpenWrt on a Linksys WRT54GL router; how to compile a custom
OpenWrt system image; how to configure networking and iptables bridging
on OpenWrt; and, of course, how to replace the native OpenWrt firewall
script with a customized iptables script that works in bridging mode.
This month, I conclude the series by showing how to achieve the same
thing using an ordinary PC running Ubuntu 10.04.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25e65c0"></a>
Hardware Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
At this late stage in the series, I assume you know what a
transparent firewall is and where you might want to deploy it on your
network. But since I haven't said a word about PC hardware since Part II
(in the September 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>), it's worth repeating a couple points I made
then about selecting network hardware, especially on laptops.
</p><p>
If it were ten years ago, I'd be talking about internal PCI network
adapters for desktop/tower systems and PCMCIA (PC-card) interfaces for
laptops. Nowadays, your system almost certainly has an Ethernet card
built in and needs only one more to act as a firewall (unless you want
a third &ldquo;DMZ&rdquo; network, but that's beyond the scope of this
series&mdash;I'm assuming you're firewalling off just one part of your network).
</p><p>
If you have a desktop or tower system with a free PCI slot, you've
got a plethora of good choices for Linux-compatible Ethernet cards. But,
if you have a laptop, or if your PCI slots are all populated, you'll
want an external USB Ethernet interface.
</p><p>
Here's the part I mentioned earlier: be sure to select a USB Ethernet
interface that supports USB 2.0, because USB 1.1 runs at only 12Mbps and
USB 1.0 at 1.5Mbps. (USB 2.0 runs at 480Mbps&mdash;plenty fast unless your
LAN runs Gigabit Ethernet.) Obviously, you also want an interface that
is supported under Linux.
</p><p>
As a general rule, I don't like to shill specific products, but in the
course of writing these articles, I had excellent experiences with the
D-Link DUB-E100, a USB 2.0, Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) interface. It's
supported under Linux by the usbnet and asix kernel modules. Chances
are, your Linux system automatically will detect a DUB-E100 interface
and load both modules. I love it when a cheap, simple device not only
&ldquo;just works&rdquo; under Linux, but also performs well, don't
you?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25e6988"></a>
Configuring Ethernet Bridging</h2></div></div><p>
You'll remember from the previous two installments that in order to
support iptables in bridging mode, your Linux kernel needs to be compiled
with <tt  >CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=1</tt>, and your
/etc/sysctl.conf file either needs
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> contain any entries for the following settings
or have them set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, if you're an Ubuntu user, you don't have to worry. Unlike OpenWrt,
the stock Ubuntu kernels already have CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER support
compiled in, and its default /etc/sysctl.conf file is just fine without
needing any editing by you. Odds are, this is true for Debian and other
Debian derivatives as well, although I haven't had a chance to verify
it myself.
</p><p>
One thing you probably <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have to do, however, is install the
command <tt  >brctl</tt> by way of either Debian's/Ubuntu's bridge-utils package
or whatever package through which your non-Debian-derived distribution of
choice provides the brctl command. This is seldom a default package,
so if entering the command <tt  >which brctl</tt> doesn't yield a path to the
brctl command, you need to install it.
</p><p>
As with OpenWrt, however, you will not need the
<tt  >ebtables</tt>
(Ethernet Bridging tables) command, unless you want to filter network
traffic based on Ethernet header information, such as MAC (hardware)
address and other very low-level criteria. Nothing I describe in this
series requires ebtables, just plain-old iptables.
</p><p>
If you've got two viable Ethernet interfaces, if your kernel supports
iptables in bridging mode, and if your system has bridge-utils installed,
you're ready to set up bridging! On Ubuntu Server and other
Debian-derived, nongraphical systems, this involves changes to only
one file, /etc/network/interfaces&mdash;unless, that is, your window manager controls networking. See the sidebar
Networking Tips: GNOME vs. You for instructions on disabling GNOME's
Network Manager system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25e6f08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Networking Tips: GNOME vs. You</b></p><p>
Normally, any computer you're configuring to act as a network device or
server should not run the X Window System for reasons of performance
and security. But if, for some reason, such as testing, you want to set up
bridging on Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop (or any other GNOME-based distribution),
you need to be aware of a few things.
</p><p>
Traditionally, Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives store network
interface configurations in the file /etc/network/interfaces. However,
GNOME's Network Manager system automatically configures any interface
not explicitly described in that file.
</p><p>
In theory, this should mean that if you specify interface and bridge
configurations in /etc/network/interfaces, you shouldn't have to worry
about Network Manager overriding or otherwise conflicting with those
settings. But in practice, at least in my own experience on Ubuntu 10.04,
you're better off <span   class="emphasis"><em>disabling</em></span> Network Manager altogether in the
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Startup Applications applet, if you want to
set up persistent bridge settings in /etc/network/interfaces.
</p><p>
To <span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span> disable Network Manager, you also need to open the
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Network Connections control panel and delete
all connection profiles under the Wired tab. Even if Network Manager
is disabled as a startup service, Ubuntu will read network configuration
information set by this control panel, resulting in strange interactions
with /etc/network/interfaces.
</p><p>
On my test system, even after disabling the Network Manager service,
setting up /etc/network/interfaces as shown in Listing 1 and
stopping and restarting /etc/init.d/networking, eth2 kept showing up
in my routing table with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>same IP address</em></span> as br0, even though
br0 should have been the only interface with <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> IP address (let
alone a route). Clearing out eth2's entry in Network Connections and
again restarting networking fixed the problem.
</p><p>
To kill the running Network Manager processes, first find its process
ID using <tt  >ps auxw |grep nm-applet</tt>. Then, do
<tt  >sudo kill -9 [PID]</tt>
(substituting [PID] with the process ID, of course) to shut down Network
Manager. This is a good point to configure networking manually by editing
/etc/network/interfaces (<tt  >sudo vi
/etc/network/interfaces</tt>). Finally,
restart networking by entering <tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/networking
restart</tt>.
</p></div><p>
So, let's examine a network configuration for bridged eth1 and
eth2 interfaces. (To you fans of Fedora, Red Hat, SUSE and
other non-Debian-ish distributions, I apologize for my recent
Ubuntu-centrism. But hopefully, what follows here gives you the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gist</em></span> of what you need to do within your respective
distribution's
manual-network-configuration schemes.)
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows my Ubuntu 10.04 firewall's /etc/network/interfaces
file. My test system is actually an Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop system, but
I've disabled Network Manager as described in the sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25e7698"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. /etc/network/interfaces</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
address 127.0.0.1
netmask 255.0.0.0

auto br0

  netmask 255.255.255.0
  pre-up ifconfig eth1 down

  post-down ifconfig eth2 down
  post-down ifconfig br0 down
  post-down brctl delif br0 eth1
  post-down brctl delif br0 eth2
  post-down brctl delbr br0
</pre></div><p>
The first part of Listing 1 shows settings for lo, a virtual network
interface used by local processes to communicate with each other. I've
explicitly assigned lo its customary IP address 127.0.0.1 and subnetwork
mask 255.0.0.0.
</p><p>
The rest of Listing 1 gives the configuration for br0, my logical bridge
interface. First, I set the bridge interface's IP address to 10.0.0.253
with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, just as I did with OpenWrt. Note that
when you associate physical network interfaces with a logical bridge
interface, the bridge interface gets an IP address, but the physical
interfaces do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>. They are, at that point, just ports on a bridge.
</p><p>
Note that on my test system, eth1 and eth2 are the names assigned to my
two USB D-Link DUB-E100 interfaces. It's actually more likely you'd use
your machine's built-in Ethernet interface (probably named eth0), and
that any second interface you'd add would be named eth1. When in doubt,
run the command <tt  >tail -f /var/log/messages</tt> before attaching your second
interface to see what name your system assigns to it. You also can type
<tt  >sudo ifconfig -a</tt> to get detailed information on all network interfaces
present, even ones that are down.
</p><p>
Continuing the analysis of Listing 1, after I configure
the bridge IP address and netmask, I actually bring
<span   class="emphasis"><em>down</em></span> the two
physical interfaces I'm going to bridge, before invoking the brctl
command to create the bridge (br0) and add each interface (eth1 and eth2)
to it. The last step in bringing the bridge up is to assign to both
physical interfaces, eth1 and eth2, the reserved address 0.0.0.0,
which has the effect of allowing each of those interfaces to receive
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> packet that reaches it&mdash;which is to say, having an interface listen on IP address 0.0.0.0 makes
that interface promiscuous. This is a necessary behavior of switch
ports. It does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean all packets entering on one port
will be forwarded to some other port automatically; it merely means that
all packets entering that port will be read and processed by the kernel.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;post-down&rdquo; statements in Listing 1, obviously enough, all concern
breaking down the bridge cleanly on shutdown.
</p><p>
Once you've restarted networking with a <tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/networking
restart</tt>, your system should begin bridging between its two physical
interfaces. You should test this by connecting one interface on your
Linux bridge/firewall to your Internet-connected LAN and connecting
the other interface to some test system. The test system shouldn't have
any problem connecting through to your LAN and reaching the Internet,
as though there were no Linux bridge in between&mdash;at least, not yet it
shouldn't. But, we'll take care of that!

Configuring iptables in Bridging Mode</h2></div></div><p>
Now it's time to configure the Linux bridge with the same firewall
policy I implemented under OpenWrt. Listing 2 shows last month's custom
iptables script, adapted for use as an Ubuntu init script. (Actually,
we're going to run it from the new &ldquo;upstart&rdquo; system rather than init,
but more on that shortly.)

Space doesn't permit a detailed walk-through of this script, but the
heart of Listing 2 is the &ldquo;do_start&rdquo; routine, which sets all three
default chains (INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT) to a default DROP policy
and loads the firewall rules. The example rule set enforces this policy:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hosts on the local LAN may send DHCP requests through the firewall
and receive their replies.
</p></li><li><p>
Hosts on the local LAN may connect to the firewall using Secure Shell.
</p></li><li><p>
Only the local Web proxy may send HTTP/HTTPS requests and receive
their replies.
</p></li><li><p>
Hosts on the local LAN may send DNS requests through the firewall and
receive their replies.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This policy assumes that the network's DHCP and DNS servers are on the
other side of the firewall from the LAN clients, but that its Web proxy
is on the same side of the firewall as those clients.
</p><p>
You may recall that with OpenWrt, the state-tracking module that allows
the kernel to track tcp and even some udp applications by transaction
state, rather than one packet at a time, induces a significant performance
hit. Although that's almost certainly not so big an issue on a PC-based
firewall that has enough RAM and a fast enough CPU, I'm going to leave it
to you to figure out how to add state tracking to the script in Listing
2; it isn't difficult at all!
</p><p>
I have, however, added some lines at the end of the &ldquo;do_start&rdquo; routine
to log all dropped packets. Although logging on OpenWrt is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>especially</em></span>
problematic due to the limited virtual disk capacity on the routers on
which it runs, this is just too important a feature to leave out on a
proper PC-based firewall. On most Linux systems, firewall events are
logged to the file /var/log/messages, but if you can't find any there,
they instead may be written to /var/log/kernel or some other file under
/var/log.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25defa8"></a>
Enabling the Firewall Script</h2></div></div><p>
As you may be aware, Ubuntu has adopted a new startup script system. The
old one, the init system, still works, and if you prefer, you can enable
the script in Listing 2 the old-school way by making it executable
and creating rc.d links by running this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo update-rc.d iptables_custom start 36 2 3 4 5 . 
 &#8618;stop 98 0 1 6
</pre>
</p><p>
However, I recommend you take the plunge into the world of the newer
&ldquo;upstart&rdquo; system by skipping update-rc.d and instead adding the following
script, iptables_custom.conf (Listing 3), to /etc/init
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
/etc/init.d).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ee580.0x25df268"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Upstart Configuration File for iptables_custom</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

# iptables_custom

description	"iptables_custom"
author		"Mick Bauer &lt;mick@wiremonkeys.org&gt;"

start on (starting network-interface
	  or starting network-manager
	  or starting networking)

stop on runlevel [!023456]

console output

pre-start exec /etc/init.d/iptables_custom start
post-stop exec /etc/init.d/iptables_custom stop

</pre></div><p>
Rather than requiring you to figure out which start/stop number to
assign to your &ldquo;rc.&rdquo; links, upstart lets you just specify what needs to
start beforehand (in this example: network-interface, network-manager
or networking). As you can see, this iptables_custom.conf file
then invokes /etc/init.d/iptables_custom, as listed in Listing 2,
to do the actual work of loading or unloading rules. For that reason,
/etc/init.d/iptables_custom must be executable whether you use it as an
init script or an upstart job.
</p><p>
After saving your /etc/init/iptables_custom.conf file, you must enable
it with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo initctl reload-configuration
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you either can reboot or enter this command to load the firewall
rules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo initctl start iptables_custom
</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And that, in one easy procedure, is how to create a bridging firewall
using a Linux PC! I hope I've explained all of this clearly enough for
you to figure out how to make it meet your specific needs. I also hope
you found the previous few months' foray into OpenWrt to be worthwhile.

The Paranoid Penguin will return in a couple months, after I've had
a short break. In the meantime, go forth and secure things!
