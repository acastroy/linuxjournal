Simplify the time-consuming data backup process with zero downtime using
LVM2 snapshot.

Sometimes we use a technology even though we're 
unaware of its full features and capabilities and how they may be able
to benefit us. One such feature is the data snapshot. The snapshot is
a single state (that is, a copy) of a storage volume at a particular point
in time. A volume can refer to a disk device or partition. The snapshot
is primarily a data backup technology. Directed toward larger storage
capacities, utilizing such a technique has advantages. For
instance, full backups of an entire volume can take a long time and also
use large amounts of storage space, even for files that will remain
unchanged for some time to come. Also, when performing a data backup
of entire volumes or subsets of volumes in a symmetric multiprocessing
environment, write operations still may continue to modify the file data
on that volume, preventing atomicity and, in turn, possibly leading to data
corruption. There are ways around the latter in which the volume can
be taken off-line or marked as read-only prior to the archival process,
but in high-availability production environments, that may never be an
option. This is where the snapshot comes in.
</p><p>
Used to avoid downtime and retain atomicity, the snapshot provides
a read-only copy of a specified volume at a specific point in time,
usually implemented by a copy-on-write mechanism. Some vendors and
software implementations are known to support write commands via a
concept known as branching snapshots, in which diverging versions of
data are created via an extremely complex system of pointers, all based
on the original snapshot. When you write to a snapshot or the original
volume, the write will not be seen by the other. The way this works is
when a volume marked for snapshot gets written to and data is modified,
the original and unchanged data block(s) or file data (in the case of
a file-based snapshot) will be copied to the space allocated for the
snapshot. After all original and unmodified data are copied over to the
snapshot, the original volume will be updated with the new data. When
the snapshot volume needs to be mounted, using a system of pointers,
the snapshot will reference the parent volume with the original data
saved in the snapshot. With such a technique, it now becomes possible to
archive valuable data incrementally without losing productivity or the
risk of suffering from any data corruption.
</p><p>
The use of snapshot technologies can be seen in a variety of environments,
ranging from external storage controllers, filesystems, virtual machines
(such as VMware, VirtualBox and so on), databases and even volume managers,
which is the focus of this article. Here, I cover the snapshot
feature found in LVM2 and how to manage it, all from the command line.

LVM2 refers to a collection of user-space tools that provide logical
volume management on Linux.

The Linux Logical Volume Manager</h2></div></div><p>
The second generation of the Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM2) 
is a logical volume manager capable of pooling multiple
storage devices together to represent a single volume or volumes, either in a
striped or mirrored fashion. Everything is created and managed on a layer-by-layer
basis. First is the physical volume. It is followed
by the volume group and then the mountable logical volume itself. Most
mainstream Linux distributions usually have the LVM2 userland tools
preinstalled. If you find that it's not installed on your distribution,
download and install it via your distribution's package repository.
</p><p>
The idea is almost similar in concept to the Redundant Array of
Independent Disks (RAID), and although LVM2 does not support any
parity-driven striping, it still adds additional value. For instance, LVM2
allows for the uninterrupted addition, removal and replacement of storage
devices. It makes for easy dynamic resizing of volume groups and logical
volumes. Most important, it supports the snapshot&mdash;the focus of this
article. As of LVM2, write operations are supported to snapshot volumes.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, LVM2 volumes utilize a layered structure&mdash;that is,
physical volumes (or PVs) must be created from a physical disk device. This
can be accomplished with the pvcreate command followed by the list of
physical partitions to label for LVM2 usage:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
</pre>
</p><p>
With the newly labeled physical volumes, volume groups (or VGs) need
to be created with the vgcreate command, followed by a name for the volume
group and then a list of all physical volumes to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo vgcreate vg0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
  Volume group "vg0" successfully created
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, the volume groups are located in the /dev directory path. It
is with this volume group that logical volumes (or LVs) can be created,
formatted with a filesystem, mounted and, in turn, used for file I/O
operations. The best feature of creating logical volumes is that you
can use some or all available capacity of the VG. For instance, if a 1GB LV needs to be created from the 4GB VG, the lvcreate command 
needs to be used followed by the name of the VG and then a size for the
LV. When an LV is created, it will create a node name for accessibility
in the /dev directory path under the volume group's name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvcreate --name /dev/vg0/test_vg --size 1G
  Logical volume "test_vg" created
</pre>
</p><p>
The example above showcases the creation of a nonredundant LV. To create
an LV with mirroring capabilities, invoke the lvcreate command with the
-m option. The example below creates a 500MB-mirrored LV:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvcreate --size 500M -m1 --name mirrorlv vg0 
 &#8618;/dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
  Logical volume "mirrorlv" created
</pre>
</p><p>
You can remove logical volumes, volume groups and physical volumes easily with
the lvremove, vgremove and pvremove commands followed by their respective
volume names:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvremove /dev/vg0/test_vg
Do you really want to remove active logical volume "test_vg"? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "test_vg" successfully removed
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that a list of all logical volumes, volume groups and physical
volumes with detailed volume information can be displayed with the
lvdisplay, vgdisplay and pvdisplay commands.

LVM2 Snapshots</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've covered a brief summary of how LVM2 is structured and
managed, it's time to focus on the snapshot feature. It is worth
noting that the LVM2 snapshot feature can be used only on LVM2-managed
logical volumes. Assuming that an LV already exists, possibly the partition
for the / directory path, a second LV needs to be created for the
snapshot of the original logical volume. With regard to size, another
great feature of the snapshot is that the snapshot volume does not have
to be equal in size to the original volume. The size even can be half or
less than the original volume, allowing only that many changes of data to
be backed up. By default, LVM2 will disable the snapshot automatically if
the snapshot LV ever gets filled. The amount of storage space necessary
is dependent on the usage of the snapshot. If the snapshot size equals
the size of the original LV, it never will overflow, and snapshot service
will not be interrupted. In the worst-case scenario, if it is found that space
is running out on the snapshot, the LV always can be resized dynamically 
to a larger capacity.
</p><p>
Define the size to allocate for the snapshot. Create the snapshot on
the desired VG by using the lvcreate command, with the size followed by
the snapshot switch, the name for the snapshot and the VG. In this example,
only 500MB are allocated for modified data. Realistically, this is not an
ideal size to use (it's too small but serves its purpose here):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvcreate -L500M -s -n rootsnapshot /dev/VolGroup/lv_root
  Logical volume "rootsnapshot" created
</pre>
</p><p>
The lvdisplay command displays all details pertaining to the snapshot
LV. One detail to keep an eye on is the &ldquo;Allocated to snapshot&rdquo;
value. In this example, it is set to 0.06%:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvdisplay /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
  VG Name               VolGroup
  LV UUID                kAc3Iq-Gn3e-pBWs-KC9V-bFi8-0fHr-SsdRLR
  LV Write Access     read/write
  LV snapshot status active destination for /dev/VolGroup/lv_root
  LV Status              available
  # open                  0
  LV Size                  5.51 GiB
  Current LE              1410
  COW-table size       500.00 MiB
  COW-table LE         125
  Allocated to snapshot  0.06%
  Snapshot chunk size    4.00 KiB
  Segments               1
  Allocation                inherit
  Read ahead sectors   auto
  - currently set to      256
  Block device             253:3
</pre>
</p><p>
If the original LV is written to, using the copy-on-write mechanism,
the snapshot will write all original data from the original volume to
the snapshot volume before it replaces the original volume with the new
data. To better understand the mechanics behind the snapshot, mount the
snapshot volume, so that it can be accessed like any other mounted device.

Here is a simple exercise to verify that the snapshot is functional: write
to the original volume&mdash;that is, modify an existing file or add/remove
a file. The original data for those files will be present on the mounted
snapshot. If a new file is added/removed from the original volume, it
will not be present on the snapshot. Note that the same logic applies if
the snapshot data is modified. The original volume will remain unaltered:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/petros/test.file count=65536
65536+0 records in
65536+0 records out
33554432 bytes (34 MB) copied, 2.95349 s, 11.4 MB/s
$ ls /home/petros/
Desktop    Downloads  Music     Public     test.file
Documents  drvadm     Pictures  Templates  Videos
$ ls /mnt/VolGroup/rootsnapshot/home/petros/
Desktop    Downloads  Music     Public     Videos
Documents  drvadm     Pictures  Templates
</pre>
</p><p>
Using the lvdisplay command, you now can observe that more space has
been allocated for the snapshot volume. The value for the &ldquo;Allocated to
snapshot&rdquo; field has increased to 0.24%:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvdisplay /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name               /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
  VG Name               VolGroup
  LV UUID                kAc3Iq-Gn3e-pBWs-KC9V-bFi8-0fHr-SsdRLR

  LV Size                 5.51 GiB
  Current LE             1410
  COW-table size      500.00 MiB
  COW-table LE        125
  Allocated to snapshot  0.24%
  Snapshot chunk size    4.00 KiB
  Segments              1
  Allocation               inherit
  Read ahead sectors  auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           253:3
</pre>
</p><p>
Removing a snapshot is almost as simple as creating it. First, unmount the
snapshot, and then use the lvremove command to remove the LV from the VG:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo umount /mnt/VolGroup/rootsnapshot/
$ sudo lvremove /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
</pre>
</p><p>
In some versions of various Linux distributions, including Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (also in the latest beta release of RHEL 6), CentOS
and even SUSE Linux, there exists a known problem when attempting
to remove or deactivate logical volumes. Unable to remove the LV, the
following error message will be returned: <tt  >Can't remove open logical
volume "rootsnapshot"</tt>. If <tt  >dmsetup info -c
rootsnapshot</tt> is invoked
on the command line, the status of the LV will be returned and it will
confirm the error message. To work around this, use the dmsetup command
followed by the lvremove command. Confirm that the LV has been removed
with the lvdisplay command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dmsetup remove /dev/mapper/VolGroup-rootsnapshot-cow
$ sudo dmsetup remove /dev/mapper/VolGroup-rootsnapshot
$ sudo lvremove /dev/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
  Logical volume "rootsnapshot" successfully removed
</pre>

Best Practices</h2></div></div><p>
In some cases, it is advised to ensure that enough storage space is
allocated for the snapshot or (as discussed below) a backup directory
that will contain all of the archived snapshot data for restoring
purposes. To extend an existing volume group, a new PV needs to be
labeled. To do so, identify the physical storage device, and using fdisk,
sfdisk or parted, create the desired partition size. Verify the partition
by reading back the partition table. Then, continue to create the PV:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo sfdisk -l /dev/sde

Disk /dev/sde: 261 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track
Units = cylinders of 8225280 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, 
        counting from 0

   Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System
/dev/sde1          0+    260     261-   2096451   83  Linux
/dev/sde2          0       -       0          0           0   Empty
/dev/sde3          0       -       0          0           0   Empty
/dev/sde4          0       -       0          0           0   Empty

$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sde1
  Physical volume "/dev/sde1" successfully created
</pre>
</p><p>
Append a newly labeled PV to an existing VG with the vgextend command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo vgextend VolGroup /dev/sde1
  Volume group "VolGroup" successfully extended
</pre>
</p><p>
If at some point the PV needs to be removed from a VG, use the vgreduce
command followed by the names of the VG and the PV:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo vgreduce VolGroup /dev/sde1
</pre>
</p><p>
If the VG is being extended for the purpose of creating a backups
directory to archive routine snapshots, following the normal lvcreate
procedure, define the name, size and VG for the desired LV. Then, format
the LV with a filesystem, and for file I/O accessibility, mount it to a
directory path:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvcreate --name backups --size 1G VolGroup
  Logical volume "backups" created
$ sudo mke2fs -j /dev/VolGroup/backups
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/VolGroup/backups
$ sudo mount /dev/VolGroup/backups /mnt/VolGroup/backups
</pre>
</p><p>
When the snapshot has been created, an archive can be made with the tar
command, located in the newly created backups directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo tar -pczf /mnt/VolGroup/backups/rootsnapshot.tar.gz 
 &#8618;/mnt/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
</pre>
</p><p>
In an event of failure or if older revisions of files need to be
retrieved, the archived snapshot can be used to restore the original
data contents. This is an extremely ideal backup strategy when
running a high-availability production environment. No downtime is
required. Although this backup does not necessarily need to be written
to a file, using the tar or dd commands, the snapshot can be written
directly to another physical storage device, including a tape drive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo tar -cf /dev/st0 /mnt/VolGroup/rootsnapshot
</pre>

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
LVM2 comes prepackaged with some of the more common Linux-based
distributions. In some cases, it even is used as part of the default
filesystem layout. Its snapshot feature is one of those lesser-known
treasures that really can be used to one's advantage, ranging from
personal to larger-scale environments. All it takes is a little time,
a little knowledge and a plan on design, deployment and configuration.
