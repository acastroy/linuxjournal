The Virtual Machine Manager tools (aka virt-manager and libvirt)
make it simple to set up and manage multiple KVM-based virtual machines.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb5580.0x20ad2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
KVM is the kernel-based virtual machine, a mainline kernel feature since
versuib 2.6.20 for running virtualized guest systems on top of a host system. In
less technical terms, this means you can run other operating systems as just
another window on your desktop. But, before you can get to the desktop, you
need to become familiar with creating and managing virtual machines using
the Virtual Machine Manager suite of tools.
</p><p>
Each virtual machine instance, referred to as a VM, has its own virtualized
hardware. This includes a chunk of memory and one or more of the available
CPUs, network and graphics hardware, virtual disks and a mouse. The
Virtual Machine Manager tools, often referred to collectively by the name of the primary
GUI application virt-manager, make it possible to 
bring up the virtual hardware quickly with the virtual CD-ROM device
&ldquo;connected to&rdquo; an ISO
file in order to install an operating system. At work, we run a variety of
Linux distributions and a couple Windows versions. Each operating
system instance is installed with a base configuration that is common to
all copies of that instance. This is known as a base image. From these, we
make copies, known as clones, in which specific applications are installed.
This result of cloning and custom application configuration is what the
cloud computing world refers to as virtual appliances.
</p><p>
KVM is one of a number of options for running virtual machines. Xen,
VirtualBox and VMware are alternatives with different requirements for
setup and use. KVM was chosen for use at my office, because of the
simplicity of setup on Fedora systems (the standard Linux development
platform at work) and because of the ease of creating and using virtual
machines across the internal network. The process discussed here is
applicable specifically to using KVM-based virtual machines.
</p><p>
Since KVM is part of the kernel, most modern Linux distributions offer KVM
kernels. However, the user-level tools that utilize KVM, such as
virt-manager and libvirt, are what most users will be interested in. Check
your distribution for availability of ready-to-install packages or grab the
source packages from the URLs provided at the end of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb5580.0x20ad618"></a>
Getting Started: Host Hardware Setup</h2></div></div><p>
In virtualization parlance, the host system is the real hardware and its
operating system that will be the platform on which you will run guest
systems. Each guest system is the KVM-based virtual hardware and the OS
installed on it. Before you can use a KVM-enabled kernel on your host
system, you need to make sure your hardware supports virtualization. To
check whether the processor supports virtualization, search for the following
CPU flags:

<pre     class="programlisting">
egrep "vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo
</pre>
</p><p>
Intel processors with VM support will have the vmx flag in the output of
this command. AMD processors that support virtual machines use the svm
flag. This command will print one line for each CPU core with VM support.
</p><p>
The next step is to configure the host operating system. The first thing
to do is install the user-space tools associated with virt-manager:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo yum install kvm qemu libvirt \
                 libvirt-python python-virtinst \
                 bridge-utils virt-manager
</pre>
</p><p>
This may install additional packages, but these are the ones critical to
using KVM and virt-manager. These package names are specific to Fedora.
Check your distribution for proper package names.
</p><p>
After installing the required software, a bridge network device needs to be
added to the host system. Using a bridge device allows the VM to function
like any other system on your network, using its own IP address. On the
host system, the bridge will be assigned an IP address and the default
&ldquo;eth&rdquo;
device will be attached to that. Using a bridged network is a little
easier if you disable NetworkManager:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# chkconfig NetworkManager off
# chkconfig network on
# service NetworkManager stop
# service network start
</pre>
</p><p>
NetworkManager is ideal for mobile
platforms, but as of Fedora 12, it's not suitable for use with shared
networks,
such as those used with a host and guest virtualized systems. Although you
can run KVM on mobile systems, this article assumes the use of a desktop or
server that is unlikely to need to change network configurations often.
</p><p>
Note that the above commands must be run as root. On Fedora,
configuration scripts for each network device are located under
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. Assuming there is at least one network
card in your system, there will be a configuration file named ifcfg-eth0 in
that directory. Open it and add the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BRIDGE=br0
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, comment out the following lines by prefixing each line with the #
symbol:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#BOOTPROTO=none
#DNS1=...
#GATEWAY=...
#IPADDR=...
#NETMASK=...
</pre>
</p><p>
To add the bridge device, create a file called ifcfg-br0 in that directory,
and add the following lines to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=br0
TYPE=Bridge
BOOTPROTO=static
DNS1=...
GATEWAY=...
IPADDR=...
NETMASK=...
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
The lines with ... can, in most cases,
be the lines that you commented out of ifcfg-eth0.
Note that the TYPE entry is case-sensitive.
</p><p>
Be sure to assign proper values for DNS, GATEWAY, IPADDR and NETMASK. This
example assumes a static IP address, but if the device will use DHCP, 
change BOOTPROTO and leave these entries out:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=br0
TYPE=Bridge
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the host also should have a large amount of disk space for the VM
image files. The size of these can vary, but in this article, we'll create 12GB
files to support complete Linux distributions on 8GB with 4GB for local
user directories. Smaller installation partitions could be used for the
operating system, and user directories can be NFS-mounted if desired. Also,
it is possible to place the VM image files on NFS-mounted directories,
although this can have serious performance impacts when running the virtual
machine.
</p><p>
At this point, the host network can be restarted with the new networking
configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# service network start
</pre>
</p><p>
The host now is ready for use with virtual machines.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb5580.0x20adeb0"></a>
virt-manager and Friends</h2></div></div><p>
Before diving into creating virtual machines, it's important to take a look
at the related tools and files. Virtual Machine Manager is actually a
suite of tools for working with virtual machines:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
virt-install: command-line tool used to install software into a VM image.
</p></li><li><p>
virt-clone: command-line tool used to clone a VM image.
</p></li><li><p>
virt-manager: GUI for starting, stopping and using VM images.
</p></li><li><p>
virt-image: command-line tool used to create a VM-based on an XML
description.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The first three of these will be used to create, clone and use
virtual machines. The latter is useful for advanced users but is beyond
the scope of this article.
</p><p>
The virt-manager tools are Python programs that depend on the libvirt
library to manage virtual machines and QEMU to run the virtual machines.
Both libvirt and QEMU offer sophisticated features for a wide variety of
tasks. Fortunately, you don't need to know anything about QEMU to get
started using a VM, and you need to know only very basic information about
libvirt.
</p><p>
The virt-manager application uses VNC to connect to remote libvirt d&aelig;mons
and view remote virtual machines on a local display. This means you can
launch virt-manager on your system and connect to a VM running on another
system across the network. Such connections will require password
authentication in most cases, depending on how libvirt is configured. This
article takes the simple (and highly insecure) path of using root SSH
access to access remote hosts. This works for my company, because the
virtual machines are on an insulated networks. This also works if you're
behind a well-configured firewall at home, but to be safe, consider further
research into the secure (TLS) transport options of libvirt.
</p><p>
Note that virt-manager provides a wizard for creating new
virtual machines on the localhost using local or remote media
installations (Figure 1). However, this article focuses on the underlying tools
virt-install and virt-clone. These tools offer far more power and
flexibility when creating virtual machines.

Installing Base Images</h2></div></div><p>
With the software installed and the host network configured, it's time to
create a base image. The base image is an installation of an operating
system into a VM image file. These files can
take multiple formats, but the recommended format is qcow2:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system \
                  -n &lt;vm-name&gt; \
                  -r 512 \
                  --vcpus=1 \
                  -f ~/&lt;vm-name&gt;.qcow2 \
                  -s 12 \
                  -c &lt;distro-install-image&gt;.iso \
                  --vnc \
                  --noautoconsole \
                  --accelerate \
                  --os-type linux \
                  --os-variant generic26 \
                  --network=bridge:br0

</pre>
</p><p>
Replace &lt;vm-name&gt; with a symbolic name for the virtual machine. At
work, we
use the distribution name, version and CPU size, such as
&ldquo;fedora11-64&rdquo;.
The &lt;distro-install-image&gt; is the name of the ISO image file used to install a
Linux distribution.
</p><p>
The man page for virt-install covers the available options in detail. This
particular command attaches to the local hypervisor as root (--connect) and
sets up a guest virtual machine with 512MB of memory and the maximum number
of CPUs it can use (-r, --vcpus). It will create a virtual machine image
in the file ~/&lt;vm-name&gt;.qcow2 that is 12GB (-f, -s) and boot the
installation media &lt;distro-install-image&gt;.iso. virt-install will start a VNC
console on the guest and make it available for use via the host (--vnc),
but no connection to it is started by default (--noautoconsole). A
connection to it will be made later using virt-manager. The guest machine
will run using kernel acceleration if available (--accelerate).
</p><p>
The guest will be created using optimized ACPI, APIC, mouse and other
hardware configurations (--os-type, --os-variant) and use the bridged
network device (--network). Note that the os_type has specific valid
values. Check the man page for details.
</p><p>
This command will exit immediately while it starts up the VM in the
background. To interact with the operating system installation, start the
virt-manager application. This program will recognize VNC servers on the
local network and list them (Figure 2). Double-clicking on one will open a connection
to that host and list the available guest systems. Double-clicking on a
guest will open a window to the guest (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Each OS will set the default size of the console.
The console window can be scaled up, but not down,
using the View&rarr;Scale Display menu.
</p></div></div><p>
With the VNC window open, the installation proceeds just as it would when
installing on bare metal. Click inside the VM window to activate the guest
VM mouse, then hold down Ctrl-Alt at the same time to return the mouse to
the host desktop. In many cases, you won't need to capture the mouse
pointer this way. Instead, just type with the host mouse pointer over the
VM console window and keystrokes are passed to the guest VM.
</p><p>
Once the installation completes, a reboot typically is required.
A reboot of the VM, that is&mdash;a reboot in this VM instance shuts down
only the
virtual machine, not the host. You must use
the Run button in the menu bar of the VNC window to start the VM
again manually. After rebooting, be sure to install any updates for the Linux
distribution.

libvirt Configurations</h2></div></div><p>
Using virt-install to create a VM image does two things. It creates an
image file, and it creates a configuration (Listing 1) to launch it for libvirt. The
configuration file is an XML file found under /etc/libvirtd/qemu, which
should be accessible only by the root user.

</pre></div><p>
If edits are done manually to this file, libvirt should be restarted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service libvirtd restart
</pre>
</p><p>
However, it probably is better not to edit the file and to use the virsh
command for libvirt to make updates to a VM configuration.
If the amount of memory or number of CPUs to use for a VM needs to be
lowered, the virt-manager Details tab needs to be used rather than
using virsh. Be sure to exit any instances of virt-manager before restarting libvirt.
</p><p>
The base image can be copied to an NFS directory along with the XML
configuration file, so that other hosts can make use of it. For another
host to use it, copy the XML file to the new host's /etc/libvirtd/qemu
directory, and edit it to point to the NFS mountpoint. Then, restart the
libvirt on the new host.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb5580.0x24a7440"></a>
Creating a Clone</h2></div></div><p>
The base image is just the core image for creating your VM appliances.
Each appliance is a clone of the base image with additional applications
installed. Base images are also known as &ldquo;backing stores&rdquo;, because the base
image is used for reads, and the clone image is used when writes occur. In
this way, the clone gets updated while the base image remains pristine.
</p><p>
Creating a clone requires that the host libvirt knows about the base image,
which means the XML configuration for the base image is in the libvirt
configuration directories and libvirt has been restarted. Cloning is
performed by the virt-clone command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo virt-clone -o &lt;base-image-name&gt; \
                -n &lt;clone-image-name&gt; \
                -f &lt;path-to-base-image&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As with virt-install, virt-clone options are described in detail in the man
page. Using the previous virt-install example and the naming scheme
described earlier, a clone of a Fedora base image would look more like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo virt-clone -o fedora11-64 \
                -n fedora11-64.1 \
                -f /home/cloneimages/fedora11-64.1
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the clone image name is the same as the base image with an
identifying suffix, and the clone image file has the same name as the image
and will be created in /home/cloneimages.
The image name is used to identify the guest VM to libvirt and is saved as
the &ldquo;name&rdquo; element in the XML configuration file for the VM. The image
filename is the name of the file where the image is located. This is
stored in the &ldquo;source file&rdquo; element of the XML configuration file.
</p><p>
Cloning an image can be a system-intensive operation. Although a quad-core
CPU with 8GB of memory might handle this just fine, a single-core system may
get bogged down if other operations are in progress. Cloning at home may
be something to leave for overnight processing.
</p><p>
Clones are not required for working with a VM. You can just as easily work
directly with the base image. Clones, however, are useful if you plan on
having multiple, independent configurations using the same base OS
installation. In other words, clones are not typically necessary at home,
but they may be required when used with clusters of servers.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
libvirt provides many features to do more complex things with virtual
machines, such as storage, networking and USB/PCI options. All of those
features should be accessed using the virsh command-line tool.
virt-manager provides GUI-based wizards for creating new virtual machines
and allows dynamic reconfiguration of the boot device while displaying
interactive performance graphs (Figure 4). For home users, the best feature of
virt-manager is its ability to show multiple VM consoles at the same time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10777f4.large.jpg"><img src="10777f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Processor and memory usage can be adjusted dynamically up
to the configured maximum for the guest.
</p></div></div><p>
Other distributions will work with KVM, although the creation of the host
bridged network is likely to be different. Advanced users may want to
investigate the use of Logical Volume Managers (LVMs) instead of flat-file
images to improve performance.
