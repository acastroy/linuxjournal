Linux is a family of operating systems, all based on the Linux kernel. Each Linux OS is
called a distribution, or a distro. There are a plethora of these. DistroWatch lists
just the top 100 of a number so large that it invites satire:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Somewhere in California&mdash;At 8:30 PDT with the release of Snoopy Linux 2.1 and Goober
Linux 1.0, the number of Linux distributions finally surpassed the number of actual Linux
users.
</p><p>
&ldquo;We've been expecting it for some time&rdquo;, Merrill Lynch technology analyst Tom Shayes said,
&ldquo;but this is a little sooner than most expected. We've seen explosive growth in the number
of Linux distributions; in fact, my nephew just put out LittleLinux Chart Tommy Linux 1.1
last week.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Except, that's not a goof on DistroWatch. It's a goof that ran on April 3,
2000&mdash;almost
11 years ago&mdash;in BBspot (<a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2000/4/linux_distros.html" target="_self">www.bbspot.com/News/2000/4/linux_distros.html</a>).
</p><p>
So Plethorization (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-and-plethorization" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-and-plethorization</a>) has been around for a long time. It is also a virtue of Linux, and of
open-source code in general. It reproduces easily by copying (literally), and by
adaptation. Distributions that evolve do so by adapting to purposes and improving. Those
that don't die off. Thus, Darwin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Origin of Species</em></span> is as relevant to code as it is to
life.
</p><p>
Species and code are both experimental. Both have genetics. Both differentiate by forking.
Both are generative. Both are brutal meritocracies. Improvements that work are what
survive and thrive. As Eric S. Raymond explains in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Magic
Cauldron</em></span>, the Linux
marketplace is not about what gets sold, but about what gets used.
</p><p>
Linux is a family of code genera and species that grows and differentiates as hackers
create and improve code for many different purposes. The result is lots of leaders but no
winners, because neither evolution nor plethorization are zero-sum games. The number of
Linux distros did not go down when Red Hat was the top distro at the turn of the
millennium, nor when Ubuntu moved to the front of the pack during the next decade.
Instead,
variants emerged.
</p><p>
The Wikipedia entry for Fedora currently lists 19 variants of that distro alone. The
Fedora Wiki says, &ldquo;There are roughly over a hundred distributions based on
Fedora.&rdquo; A
DistroWatch search (in October 2010) brings up 38. Ubuntu itself is a child of Debian.
Other Debian children include BackTrack, Knoppix, Linspire, MEPIS and Xandros.
Grandchildren through Ubuntu and Knoppix alone run into many dozens.
</p><p>
Perhaps the only popular open-source codebase to &ldquo;win&rdquo; the market-share battle is the
Apache HTTP server. According to Netcraft
(<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/08/31/august_2009_web_server_survey.html" target="_self">news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/08/31/august_2009_web_server_survey.html</a>), Apache has been the top Web server since May
1996 and has hosted the majority of the world's Web sites for most of the duration. But,
while Apache still hosts more than two-thirds of the busiest domains, its share of the Web
server market has declined since peaking several years ago (as did its main competitor,
Microsoft's IIS). Since then, other Web servers also have became popular, even though
Apache still leads the pack. But, that sports talk is zero-sum stuff. The fact is, the HTTP
server market is a growing pile, not a sliced-up pie. So, although Apache still leads in
percentage share, everybody whose numbers grow gets to keep playing. No winners required.
</p><p>
We do, however, see converging as well as diverging development vectors. Although divergence
seeks out many problems to solve, convergence zeros in on a single problem. Lately, we
have been learning that convergence needs more than a distro, just as an architect needs
more than a sturdy set of building materials. This is why we now have Android and MeeGo,
two Linux-based operating systems for mobile phones. Neither is listed among Linux distros
by Wikipedia or by DistroWatch&mdash;because they're not distros. They're a layer up from
that.
</p><p>
With Android, Google wanted to provide a complete platform for makers of mobile hardware
and software. With MeeGo, Nokia and Intel wanted to do the same. All three know Linux
well. It's under most of Google's infrastructure and on top of Intel's hardware. Nokia's
early Linux experience was with Maemo, which didn't get much traction, but which also
taught a lesson: you need more. We already see where Android is going. In the next
year,
we'll see if MeeGo does the same. In both, we'll get to see what Linux wants them to do.
</p><p>
That last sentence was informed by Kevin Kelly's brilliant new
book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>What Technology Wants</em></span>. The evolution
of technology, Kevin says, resembles that of biology by combining
three forces. The first two are <span   class="emphasis"><em>structural</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>historical</em></span>. The third in biology is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>functional</em></span>. In technology, however, the third
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>intentional</em></span>. In biology, the functional is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>adaptive</em></span>: &ldquo;the relentless engine of optimization
and creative innovation that continually solves the problems of
survival&rdquo;. But technology is interested in more than survival. The
intentional is <span   class="emphasis"><em>open</em></span>. That is, it is about &ldquo;human
free will and choice&rdquo;. Thus, &ldquo;It is the third leg, the collective choice
of free-willed individuals, that provides the character of the technium&rdquo;
(Kelly's term for the sum of technology).
</p><p>
As &ldquo;the collective choice of free-willed individuals&rdquo;, it's hard to find a better example
than Linux. What Linux wants, as a collective choice, is made clear by the distinction in
kernel development between &ldquo;kernel space&rdquo; and &ldquo;user space&rdquo;, and how the former exists and
improves to support the latter. The kernel's purpose is not to make anybody rich, or to
make and break companies. (Although it runs in the credits of many who have done those
things.) The purpose of Linux is to be useful. That's what Linux wants. That's what
everybody who uses it gets. And, that's why the population of Linux uses and users only
goes up.
