Logic Supply's LGX Extended Temperature AU115 Atom System</h2></div></div><p>
The key
selling points for Logic Supply's LGX Extended Temperature AU115 Atom
System include the fanless system's enhanced vibration and thermal
tolerances and its very compact footprint. The AU115 system, says Logic
Supply, offers reliable computing in an operating temperature environment
of &ndash;20&deg;C to 60&deg;C and is easily mountable, making it ideal for deployment
in remote monitoring, outdoor kiosks, data acquisition and networking
applications. With no fans or vent openings, the AU115 is protected from
exposure to the dust, dirt and grime typically found on
factory floors or in mobile environments. The device also conforms to the
iMIL-STD-810F standards for vibration and shock, and it can be configured
with a solid-state device for storage to extend the lifetime of the system
and ensure data integrity.

AdaCore's GNAT Pro, CodePeer</h2></div></div><p>
AdaCore recently announced two major product upgrades&mdash;GNAT Pro 7.0 and
CodePeer 2.1&mdash;both of which support the upcoming Ada 2012 language
standard. GNAT Pro is AdaCore's full-featured, multilanguage, flagship
development environment complete with libraries, bindings and a range of
supplementary tools. Besides the Ada 2012 support, GNAT Pro's key new
features include the new GNATtest automatic test framework and numerous
enhancements to several existing tools. Meanwhile, CodePeer is AdaCore's
advanced static analysis tool that helps developers detect potential
runtime and logic errors in Ada programs. By mathematically analyzing
every line of software and considering every possible input and every path
through the program, CodePeer can be used early in the development
life cycle to identify defects when they are much less costly to repair.

Roderick W. Smith's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Essentials</em></span> (Sybex)</h2></div></div><p>
It's a positive sign for our revolution to see the collection of basic
Linux books continuing to expand and diversify. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
writer Roderick W. Smith's new
title <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Essentials</em></span>, published by Sybex, adds a unique twist by adding
full-color images to the mix of resources that aid readers in understanding
the essentials of Linux. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Essentials</em></span> features a learn-by-doing
approach that clearly identifies the concepts to be covered and explores
them in a hands-on tutorial format. Topics include installation,
desktop configuration, management of files and filesystems, remote
administration, security and more. Fedora is the distribution discussed in
the book. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Essentials</em></span> is a great way to share the gift of Linux with
our new, less-technical friends and family members.

James A. Whittaker, Jason Arbon and Jeff Carollo's <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Google Tests
Software</em></span>
(Addison-Wesley)</h2></div></div><p>
Things done at &ldquo;Google scale&rdquo; are mind boggling. Hundreds of millions of
lines of code distributed across millions of source files. Billions of
build actions prompting millions of automated tests daily. Hundreds of
thousands of browser instances daily. Apps released continuously into
production for massive worldwide use. Folks, software testing doesn't
get any tougher than this. To do all of this right, Google is pioneering
the future of testing and automation. Enter the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Google Tests
Software</em></span> from author trio James A. Whittaker, Jason Arbon and Jeff Carollo,
which seeks to offer mere mortals the chance to learn from the Google
experience. The authors distill wisdom from legendary Google Testing leader
James Whittaker and other top Google experts to reveal exactly how the
Internet giant tests software and offer new best practices anyone can use.
Some of these practices include techniques for analyzing risk and planning
tests; implementing exploratory, black-box, white-box and acceptance
testing; testing &ldquo;Docs &amp; Mocks&rdquo;; and much more.

The Portland Group's PGI 2012 Compilers and Development Tools</h2></div></div><p>
The Portland Group says that its new PGI 2012 line of parallelizing
compilers and development tools helps developers leverage the huge
performance potential of GPUs better than ever before. PGI 2012, which
supports Linux, OS X and Windows, is the Portland Group's first general
release to include support for the OpenACC directive-based programming
model for NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs. The updated PGI Accelerator FORTRAN and
C compilers are targeted at scientists and engineers who are not full-time
programmers, freeing developers to focus on optimizing their algorithms.
The 2012 release is also the company's first to include the fully
feature-enabled PGI CUDA C/C++ compiler for multicore x64 CPUs from Intel
and AMD. Finally, PGI 2012 includes a number of performance and feature
enhancements for multicore x64 processor-based HPC systems.

CodeWeavers' CrossOver XI</h2></div></div><p>
The only thing not simple about CrossOver XI is &ldquo;how we pronounce the
name of the product&rdquo;, said CodeWeavers' ever irreverent CEO, Jeremy
White, recently about his company's new complete package for running
Windows-based apps on Linux or Mac. The boss is unsure whether its
customers will pronounce the name &ldquo;CrossOver Ex-Eye&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;CrossOver Eleven&rdquo;, &ldquo;CrossOver Exy&rdquo;, or his own favorite,
&ldquo;CrossOver Zigh&rdquo;. Regardless of what you call it, CrossOver XI
combines all previous versions of CodeWeavers' CrossOver software into
one simple download, giving &ldquo;everyone in our universe immediate access
to thousands of Windows applications otherwise unavailable without a
Microsoft license&rdquo;, added White. Applications, which number in the
thousands, range from Wizard 101, to Microsoft Office 2010 to
nostalgia-oozing WordPerfect 3.1.

Inductive Automation's Ignition</h2></div></div><p>
Deploy the new Ignition 7.4, says maker Inductive Automation, and you'll
feel as if you had an extra pair of hands helping you knock out your
HMI/SCADA/MES development projects. Inductive Automation bills the
Java/Web-based Ignition as the &ldquo;simplest and most innovative software
for HMI, SCADA and MES applications in the automation industry&rdquo;.
Ignition connects to nearly any major SQL database or operating system and
features a built-in OPC-UA server with drivers for the most common PLC
brands. New in v7.4 are innovations, such as dynamic component templates,
user-defined types, scripting with Python 2.5 and project templates. All of
the above, says Inductive Automation, carve out repetitive development
tasks, leaving more time for innovating, improving testing and securing
projects.

SoftIntegration's Ch 7.0 and Embedded Ch</h2></div></div><p>
SoftIntegration notes that an instructor using its Ch C/C++ interpreter,
now in version 7.0, has called it &ldquo;as close to a perfect teaching
environment&rdquo; he has ever seen. A programmer customer said using Ch is
&ldquo;the fastest way to write and deploy embeddable C/C++ scripting
programs across platforms&rdquo;. Ch 7.0 and Embedded Ch 7.0 are an
embeddable C/C++ interpreter for cross-platform scripting, 2-D/3-D plotting,
numerical computing, shell programming and embedded scripting. The 7.0
release adds new features to make Ch especially appealing for secondary
school and college students to learn computing and math. These include many
new math functions and features for plotting, QuickAnimation, ChIDE and
Embedded Ch. Embedded Ch allows users to embed Ch into an C/C++
application,
such as game, semiconductor ATE, SoC, CAM, IC, PCB, RF, MEMS or LED as a
scripting engine. Commercial and academic licenses are available.
