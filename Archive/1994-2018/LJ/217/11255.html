Not Renewing</h4><p>
My subscription was a gift, and is in the name of my then-future wife,
sometime in 1996. With the demise of the paper edition, you have lost
a customer. Electronic &ldquo;search&rdquo; capability does not compensate for
&ldquo;flicking through and finding something interesting&rdquo;. I can use Google
to seek something in which I know I am interested. Goodbye.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ian Stirling  <br><br>
</p><p>
Ian, sorry to see you go. We wish you the best!&mdash;Ed.

Digital Subscription</h4><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> Linux magazine I could find that didn't insult
my intelligence by putting a CD (with software I could download for free)
in the magazine and tripling the price.
And although this may have contributed to the exit of the print version,
I thought it showed a great respect for your readers.
</p><p>
So, although I'm not crazy about the digital version, I'll adapt/evolve and
enjoy it for many years to come because of your mentality to offer a high-quality product at a fair price.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
R. Scott Sanders  <br><br>
</p><p>
The adjustment is frustrating at times, I agree. I'm excited, however, when
I dream about the future possibilities with digital. My ideas for flip-book
animations were about as crazy as we could get with paper, but the digital
format is new. Who knows what the future might hold!&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Digital Format</h4><p>
I have no plans to buy a Kindle or any other tablet-type gizmo. That is
money better spent on oscilloscopes and stuff like that. I was struggling
with the PDF format on my Kubuntu Lucid laptop, when I discovered the EPUB
format and Calibre. Now we are cooking. I prefer paper, but I want
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> to
stay around a good long time, so I bought the CD to help support you. I do miss
reading it in the bathroom though.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike   <br><br>
</p><p>
For quick bathroom reading, smartphones aren't too bad either. I actually
like to read the EPUB version using EPUBReader on Firefox. We're glad to
have you as a subscriber, even if you're not interested in
tablets!&mdash;Ed.

Now I'm a Believer</h4><p>
I couldn't figure out why I was unable to find <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on the magazine
racks at my local bookstore. I even made a formal complaint
with the manager. So when I found out you had made a permanent transition to
digital format only, I was embarrassed. Intent on keeping this magazine and
its articles flowing, I went out and bought a NOOK (I had been toying
with the idea anyway due to many interesting hacks I had read about).
</p><p>
My one concern is regarding longevity. Eventually this device, the cloud
service running it, or the corporation backing it, will fall. What then will
I do when I want to read something printed by your magazine a few years
before? Do you at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> not worry about the direction that the cloud
and digital-distribution mentality is taking us? Am I the only IT
professional in the world that sees the problem with this trend?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Tex Standridge  <br><br>
</p><p>
Nope, you're not alone. I keep digital backups of every .pdf and .epub
edition on my computer and backed up on my server. I'm actually really
happy that as a company we've decided to offer the cloud-based interactive
version, but also provide a DRM-free downloadable version for our
customers. It helps me sleep better at night!&mdash;Ed.

Hacker Diet</h4><p>
I love the picture on the table contents page of the March 2012 issue: iPad,
remote keyboard and half-eaten snack. This must truly symbolize the
gentrification (I'd say &ldquo;yuppinization&rdquo;, but I think yuppie is
pass&eacute;
already) of hacking. Twinkies and Mountain Dew replaced by chocolate
croissant and latte?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
John McClatchie  <br><br>
</p><p>
I'm a tea drinker myself, but I won't pass up a latte if offered. I can't say
I've ever been a fan of Mountain Dew or Twinkies though. I'm not sure what
that makes me!&mdash;Ed.

wc Is One Too Many</h4><p>
I was just reading my favorite column in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, Work the Shell
by Dave Taylor, and he pointed out that <tt  >wc</tt> doesn't give an accurate
count of characters [see Dave's column in the March 2012 issue]. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo linux | wc -c
6
</pre>
</p><p>
This should be 5. First off, I want to thank Dave. I've used wc many
times, and I never noticed this before (I guess I mostly use it to count
lines and words). After realizing this, I used Google to find out why
this is happening. It turns out, wc is counting the newline character.
This is because <tt  >echo</tt>, by default, ends the line with
a new line &ldquo;\n&rdquo;.
</p><p>
A simple fix for this, in the case of using <tt  >echo</tt>, would be to use the
<tt  >-n</tt> argument, which tells <tt  >echo</tt>
not to put a new line at the end of
the line. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo -n linux|wc -c
5
</pre>
</p><p>
Thanks again to Dave Taylor for his great shell column. I love that he
doesn't just show you how it's done, but that he takes you through his thought
processes so you see why he's doing what he is doing.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kristofer Occhipinti  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for the kudos,
Kristofer. I've never really
understood why <tt  >wc</tt> doesn't have a simple flag to skip counting
nonprinting characters, which would save vast amounts of fuss. It's
even more odd if you think about how C starts array indexing at zero,
not one, so there's even more oddness in how things are counted.
</p><p>
Anyway, you're of course right that <tt  >-n</tt> addresses the problem when you're
using <tt  >wc</tt> with an <tt  >echo</tt> statement, but if you have a more complicated
pipe like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name "*.doc" -print | rev | sed 's/[aeiou]//g' | wc -c
</pre>
</p><p>
then it's hard to figure out where to put the <tt  >-n</tt> flag. Extra
credit: what does the above actually do?

iPad and Linode</h4><p>
After reading the article on replacing your laptop with an iPad [see
&ldquo;Swap Your Laptop for an iPad + Linode&rdquo; by Mark O'Connor in
the March 2012 issue], I
took advantage of the new iPad release to pick up an iPad 2,
and I was surprised to find myself enjoying it quite a bit.
</p><p>
Of course, I had trouble with iSSH because of issues with the Alt and
Ctrl key, so I'd recommend using the app called &ldquo;Prompt&rdquo;
instead. My
only problem with it is that I have to use Esc as my meta-key. Otherwise,
great article!

Why I Will Not Be Renewing My Subscription after Many Years</h4><p>
In September 2011, you decided to stop publishing a portable, permanent,
easy-to-use edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. For six months, I have received monthly
e-mails announcing new issues, and when I've had time, I've downloaded the
electronic edition, but&mdash;and this is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>crucial</em></span>&mdash;I have not read it. I don't
have time to read when I have a computer in front of me. I don't have a
touchpad, and not being able to put three or more bookmarks in the
magazine, so I
can easily move around in it (and see non-adjacent pages almost
simultaneously) all make it much less convenient. I was allowed to take paper
into areas where my classified computers are maintained too, but I can't take
electronic devices in with me (not if I hope to take them out again). Print
resolution and contrast can be better on paper too, so the physical act of
reading has become less pleasurable. I haven't read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> in six
months, and I see no likelihood of doing so any time soon. If I'm not reading
it, I don't get any benefit from it.
</p><p>
By eliminating the print edition, you have reduced the usefulness of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> to the point where I might as well not subscribe. This is not a
threat; I don't expect you to reconsider. I simply wanted you to know why you
have lost a reader.
</p><p>
I hope you retain enough readers to continue publishing. It was fun while it
lasted.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark Fishman  <br><br>
</p><p>
Sorry the new format doesn't work for you. I know a few folks are printing
issues out so they can leaf through them, but that seems to be a bit of a
kludge at best. Perhaps someday digital readers will evolve enough to
create
the tactile feel most people miss.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Digital and Tablets</h4><p>
Since you went digital, I have enjoyed reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> in PDF format
on my desktop or notebook computer, but this past weekend, I purchased a
Toshiba Thrive tablet, and one of the first things I did was
<tt  >scp</tt> the latest
issue to the tablet. I have to say, the digital version and tablets are a
marriage made in digital heaven, and I can once again take my
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> with me wherever I go. I vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the digital version.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Howard Pepper  <br><br>
</p><p>
I agree. Although I enjoy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> on an E Ink device, there's something
magical about seeing it on a full-color tablet. It's almost a bit surreal
for some reason. I'm glad you're enjoying the tablet experience!&mdash;Ed.

Subscription Site and TrueCrypt</h4><p>
I just got my February 2012 issue, and the digital edition is what most
of the Letters are about. I'm just getting used to it. The only complaint I
have is that I need my mailing label to access the subscription site
(<a href="../../index.html" target="_self">https://www.pubservice.com/SubInfo.aspx?PC=LJ&amp;do=D</a>), and I have to fetch
a printed issue to get it.
</p><p>
My second comment is related to the Non-Linux FOSS column in regards to
TrueCrypt [see the February 2012 Upfront section]. The distro I work with is Fedora, and there is no TrueCrypt
package. The reason literally is &ldquo;The TrueCrypt software is under
a poor license, which is not only non-free, but has the potential to
be actively dangerous to end users or distributors who agree to it,
opening them to possible legal action even if they abide by all of the
licensing terms, depending on the intent of the upstream copyright
holder. Fedora continues to make efforts to try to work with the
TrueCrypt upstream to fix all of the issues in their license so that
it can be considered Free, but have not yet been successful.&rdquo;
(Source:
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items#TrueCrypt" target="_self">fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items#TrueCrypt</a>.)
</p><p>
On the same page, Fedora suggests &ldquo;tc-play (<a href="https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play" target="_self">https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play</a>) is
an independently developed TrueCrypt-compatible program under the BSD
license. A tc-play package has been submitted for package review for
possible future inclusion in Fedora.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Otherwise, I really enjoy reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> from beginning to
end. Keep up
the
great work!

We have fixed the subscriber login page, so you now are able to log in with
your e-mail address and zip code. In addition to the login page, the
monthly issue download notification e-mail that you receive contains links to your issue
archive, so you
can download any issues you may have missed, as well as access your
subscription account. There is also a Manage your subscription link
that allows you to modify your account, renew or access the digital
archive.
</p><p>
Also, thanks for the info
on TrueCrypt and tc-play. I always feel a bit like I'm in uncharted waters
when I highlight a Non-Linux FOSS program. Your feedback is appreciated
by me and our readers as well.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Digital and Monitors</h4><p>I was, like many of February's letter-writers, somewhat dismayed by
the
end of the print edition, but as the compositor for a couple printed
journals (no color permitted, adequate paper for halftones, though not
great, and certainly not glazed), which have had to be priced at a great
deal more per issue than <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> ever was, I do understand
the pressures <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> was
facing. Some of the problems mentioned don't seem to me really to exist,
however. Jim Fuqua, for instance, condemns the full-spread layout of the
PDF version, but with any recent version of Adobe Reader, the button just
to the right of the zoom percentage box brings up the pages sequentially,
one by one, and you can run through the entire journal with the mouse if
you want to. (That makes me dizzy. The Enter key works fine for me.)
A properly shaped Reader panel will ensure that the paging really works in
&ldquo;fit page&rdquo; mode.
</p><p>
I am using FC15 at present, and that leads to another consideration. FC15
does a neat job of setting up an auxiliary screen, which can be
turned from landscape to portrait mode easily. It is a bit pricier than an
e-reader and can't be carried around, but I, like Jim, am a geezer.
I ride free on Philadelphia buses, and by this time, I don't even have to
show ID. I can't survive the eyestrain caused by any of the e-readers I
have yet seen (I fall asleep), but my 24" diagonal auxiliary screen has
put up this &ldquo;Contact <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>&rdquo; page
at something more than 18"
diagonal. I can read it with mid-range glasses, sitting back comfortably
and not squinnying&mdash;at about a 30" distance from the text.
</p><p>
Of course, this is not in the least bit portable, but neither, in any real
sense, is my Dell Latitude laptop. If there is an <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
article that
I really
find useful, I print it off in black and white. One could run through
color ink cartridges pretty fast with the saturated colors that the PDF
comes in, so I don't even think of printing the entire journal.
</p><p>
I did like the printed version, but as I prune down my set to the last
print issue, I will have some much-needed shelf space for other things.
The digital edition has the virtue that it doesn't take up much room. I am
close enough to the publishing industry and its woes to know that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has
made the only possible decision.
<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Pierre   <br><br>
</p><p>
I <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> a secondary monitor in portrait mode. One of
these days, I'm
actually going to buy a monitor designed for it (Dell makes a really
nice one, possibly the one you use). For anyone interested in trying it
with a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; monitor, it's important to realize some
monitors have
poor viewing angles when you tip them on their side. For looking at a
document in portrait mode, however, it's hard to beat!&mdash;Ed.

eJournal Is Still Pleasurable to Read</h4><p>
At first, I wasn't sure about the paperless <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>; I
really prefer to
read stuff on paper. PDFs tend to have small print, even on my old 19"
1280x1024 LCD. But you seem to have boosted the point size a little, and
reading on-screen really is rather pleasurable.
</p><p>
As to paying for a subscription to the magazine, I paid for access to the
information, not the paper. In fact, I started with <span   class="emphasis"><em>IEEE
Micro</em></span>. When that
went away, I subscribed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux Journal</em></span>.
When that
 folded, my
subscription was transferred to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, which has now
become, in a way, <span   class="emphasis"><em>eLJ</em></span>. And,
I'm still reading interesting articles about different aspects of Linux,
hardware and computing in general.
</p><p>
The more things change, the harder it is to peel the orange. Change is
inevitable; what matters is how we manage that change and cope with it.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
fest3er8   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for the kind words! I have noticed the layout, while still
magazine-shaped on the PDF, is a bit different and looks nice on a
computer screen. I don't know the exact details about what changed,
but I think it looks good both on a computer and on a color e-reader. I'm
glad you're enjoying it.&mdash;Ed.
