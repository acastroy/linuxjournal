ZaReason combines Sandy Bridge CPUs and screaming-fast graphics cards to
make a serious powerhouse computer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xd9f2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
About a month ago, I was contacted by Earl Malmrose of ZaReason, who wanted
to know 
if I'd like to review ZaReason's new Linux-based desktop computer, built
around the new Intel 6-Core processor and quad channel memory. I told
him I'd be thrilled to review it, and asked if he'd also include a
snappy ATI video card so I really could push the system to the limit
using one of my favorite side hobbies, namely cryptocurrencies.
</p><p>
I start with a review of the system itself and finish
with a bit of fun&mdash;I run the numbers and see what sort of CPU and
GPU-hashing power I can get from it. Whether you think cryptocurrencies
are a brilliant take on alternative economics or a dumb idea that wastes
electricity, I can assure you no one knows how to overclock hardware
quite like a Bitcoin miner. (I don't actually overclock this system,
since I'm sure ZaReason would like it back in full working order,
but I push it to the max with stock settings.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xd9f4b8"></a>
The Construction</h2></div></div><p>
Generally, if you want a case that a regular human can change parts on,
you build your own machine. That's more of a guideline than a rule,
but it seems most big computer companies like to make their cases as
proprietary as possible. Sure, you might be able to fit your computer
system into a size 4 shoebox, but good luck if you ever want to
upgrade your hardware. ZaReason, on the other hand, includes a standard
CoolerMaster brand mid-side tower case. I use the term
&ldquo;mid-size&rdquo;
rather sheepishly, as it's the quite large &ldquo;G-Lite 430 Black&rdquo; 
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11273f1.large.jpg"><img src="11273f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Valta X79 has ZaReason branding, but is otherwise sporting an
unmodified CoolerMaster case (image from <a href="http://www.zareason.com" target="_self">www.zareason.com</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
ZaReason has nicely branded the case with its company name, but
otherwise left it the standard CoolerMaster unit&mdash;refreshing,
no? To be fair, the case itself is a bit more flexible than I'd
like, but it doesn't feel cheap by any means. Part of its
flexibility is due to the massive amount of ventilation it boasts
(Figure 2). Because the X79 is meant to be a powerhouse, the cooling consideration
is greatly appreciated. In fact, it comes with an additional case fan
installed on the side to help keep the beast within on the cool side.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11273f2.large.jpg"><img src="11273f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This ventilation is appropriate, but it does make the case feel a
bit flimsy.
</p></div></div><p>
On the front panel, the case sports a power button and reset button,
as one would expect. It also has the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Two USB 2.0 ports.
</p></li><li><p>
Headphone and microphone jacks (analog).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The back of the case provides quite a generous set of connections
(Figure 3), including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Six USB 2.0 ports.
</p></li><li><p>
Two USB 3.0 ports (clearly marked).
</p></li><li><p>
One PS/2 port.
</p></li><li><p>
Gigabit Ethernet port.
</p></li><li><p>
8 channel, 7.1 analog jacks.
</p></li><li><p>
Coaxial SPDIF-out.
</p></li><li><p>
SPDIF-optical out.
</p></li><li><p>
One 1394 port (400Mbit).
</p></li><li><p>
External CMOS reset button.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11273f3.large.jpg"><img src="11273f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The ports are easy to access, and the external CMOS reset button
is very convenient.
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, all those ports really tell the story of the motherboard more
than the case, so I cover that next.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0xda0590"></a>
The Mother (Board)</h2></div></div><p>
The specifications on the Valta X79 don't specify a brand name for
the motherboard, so I won't focus on the name printed on the board,
but rather the features it boasts. First off, in order to handle the
3930K second-generation Sandy Bridge i7 CPU, the motherboard has the Intel
X79 chipset and LGA-2011 socket. (More on the CPU in a bit.) Adding to
the CPU itself, the X79 has:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Three PCI-E 3.0 x16 slots.
</p></li><li><p>
Four PCI-E x1 slots.
</p></li><li><p>
Four DDR3 Quad-Channel RAM slots.
</p></li><li><p>
16GB DDR3 RAM @1600MHz (4x4GB).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Another pleasant surprise was the power supply included with the Valta
X79. Because this build included a sizable GPU along with the zippy CPU,
ZaReason installed an 850 watt PSU. Although the wattage is about what I'd
expect, I was happy to see the power supply was an 80 Plus Gold-rated
unit. Often when building a machine for brute horsepower, little thought
is given to efficiency. Thankfully, that's not the case here. 80 Plus
Gold certification means the power supply is 87% efficient at 20% load,
90% efficient at 50% load, and 87% efficient at 100% load. As it happens,
when this system is running full bore with both the GPU and CPU maxed out,
it's using almost exactly 425 watts. Whether it was a coincidence or not,
it means the PSU was sized exactly right for maximum efficiency. Well
played, ZaReason.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11273f4.large.jpg"><img src="11273f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

When 3-D Isn't Enough</h2></div></div><p>
The graphics card shipped with my unit specifically was chosen with
Bitcoin mining in mind. Thanks to an architecture difference between
NVIDIA and ATI GPUs, the higher number of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)
in the ATI cards means they perform better watt for watt and dollar for
dollar when it comes to the pure brute force needed for Bitcoin mining and
password cracking. NVIDIA GPUs aren't subpar, they're just different. They
tend to have a more-advanced onboard memory system, making them ideal
for different sorts of mathematical calculations. The differences are
actually rather fascinating, but because I may be alone in my fascination,
I'll just leave it at that. ZaReason happily will ship either an ATI
or an NVIDIA graphics card. This review unit has the ATI Radeon HD 6970.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0x1198f70"></a>
Second-Generation i7</h2></div></div><p>
If the ATI 6970 is a Cadillac amongst video cards, the 6-core, second-generation 3930K i7 CPU running at 3.2GHz stock in the Valta X79 is a
Ferrari amongst processors. I put the CPU through its paces mining a
CPU-based cryptocurrency (Litecoin to be specific), but everything
CPU-intensive was just lightning-fast.
</p><p>
It's often difficult to find a day-to-day task that actually puts a
modern CPU to the test. Thankfully, as Linux users, we still compile quite
a bit of our software, and compilation takes CPU. I took it upon myself
to compile a few programs. Granted, none of the programs I compiled were
enormous, but I think it's telling that when I finally typed
<tt  >make</tt>,
I thought there was a dependency that <tt  >configure</tt> missed. I got
the command prompt back so quickly, that I didn't even consider the
possibility the compilation had completed!
</p><p>
I realize I make it sound like a magical CPU, and you're thinking how
adorable that Shawn guy is for being impressed by a fast CPU. The thing
is, my personal PC is an AMD 6-core monster overclocked to almost
4GHz. I've compiled the same programs, and I've never been fooled
into thinking there was an error when really it just finished that
fast. Perhaps it's raw CPU horsepower, or perhaps it's a combination of
the CPU plus the quad channel RAM. The bottom line is this CPU is
fast!

Software</h2></div></div><p>
Linux. 'Nuff said (Figure 5).

</p></div></div><p>
Seriously though, ZaReason is a company that sells Linux computers. When
configuring your system, you get to choose from the most common
distributions. By name, they offer all the 'buntus, Debian, Fedora,
Linux Mint, no operating system and my favorite, &ldquo;tell us what kind of
Linux you want.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Earl, being a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader himself, knew my feelings regarding
Ubuntu's Unity interface. For the review unit, ZaReason installed Ubuntu
11.10, but instead of the default Unity interface, they installed GNOME
3 with extensions to look much like my beloved GNOME 2 (Figure 6).
You may think the review unit got special treatment, but Earl actually
told me this interface is what they ship to many customers, especially
those uncomfortable with Unity.

We've Secretly Replaced Our Benchmarking Tools with
Cryptocurrency!</h2></div></div><p>
It's easy to look up benchmarks on specific CPUs and GPUs. Because
ZaReason sent me this unit after reading my article on cryptocurrency,
it seems only fair to benchmark it using that method. Before I delve
into hashrates and profits/losses, however, let me define a few terms
for those not familiar with cryptocurrencies:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Mining: cryptocurrency is something I've written about in past months,
but basically, it's a form of virtual currency. That currency is created
and secured by a large network of folks donating processing power to
cryptographically verify transactions. In return for that donated
processing power (aka &ldquo;mining&rdquo;), virtual coinage is produced and
distributed to the miners. This both introduces the currency fairly
into the economy and gives people an incentive for donating their
processing power.
</p></li><li><p>
Hashrate: this is the speed at which miners can verify transactions, or
more precisely, the speed at which they can solve the math problems that
verify transactions. The faster the processor, the higher the hashrate.
</p></li><li><p>
Bitcoin: the most widely accepted and traded cryptocurrency. The algorithm
used to verify transactions is SHA256 and is most efficiently mined
with GPUs, specifically AMD/ATI-brand GPUs.
</p></li><li><p>
Litecoin: created to be the silver to Bitcoin's gold, Litecoin uses the
Scrypt algorithm with the intent of being more efficient to mine with a
CPU. Scrypt is more memory-intensive than SHA256, so CPUs have an easier
time verifying the transactions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Another important thing to understand about cryptocurrency is
that the speculation market for individual currencies is extremely
volatile. Bitcoins have traded for as little as fractions of a penny each,
all the way to more than $30 each. Litecoins peaked at about a nickel, and
at the time of this writing, they are selling for about a half-cent each. Cryptocurrencies
are fun to play with, but I certainly don't recommend investing more
than you can afford to lose.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca7580.0x1199d30"></a>
Torture Testing, for Profit!</h2></div></div><p>
Let me start with the graphics card. First, the AMD 6970 is an
incredibly fast gaming card. I know that's not what I'm reviewing,
but it's worth noting I couldn't get this thing to drop a frame no matter
how hard I tried.
</p><p>
When it comes to Bitcoin mining, the 6970 is no slouch either. Running
at stock clockrates and voltages, I was able to mine Bitcoins at around
375 million hashes per second, or MH/s. Using my Kill-A-Watt meter,
I measured the difference in wattage at about 225 watts versus the idle
GPU. Using the profitability calculator at <a href="http://allchains.info" target="_self">allchains.info</a>, given
the current Bitcoin difficulty and trading price, it turns out I can mine
about $1.10 worth of Bitcoins every day. Keep in mind, however, that my
electricity costs about $0.11 per kilowatt hour, so while I might make
$1.10 in Bitcoins, it costs me $0.59 in electricity. At current rates
(end of March 2012), that means this computer will make about $0.51 per day
in profits, along with quite a bit of noise and heat.
</p><p>
The second-generation i7 processor, with its new AVX instruction set, is
the fastest Litecoin miner I've ever seen. Running all six cores (12 with
hyperthreading), the Core i7-3930K uses right around 200 watts according
to my Kill-A-Watt. That's actually a little lower than some benchmarks
I've seen, but nonetheless, it's what I recorded. The impressive part
is that the CPU was able to sustain about 72 thousand hashes per second
(KH/s), which is more than twice as fast as my AMD 6-core CPU can muster.
Using the same profitability calculator from allchains.info, this CPU
can mine around 42 Litecoins a day. Since the price of Litecoins is so
low, that equates to only around $0.23. Unfortunately, at 200 watts,
it costs around $0.53 per day to mine, so if I were to mine Litecoins
today, I'd lose around $0.30 a day.
</p><p>
That is where the speculation comes in. Just a few short weeks ago,
Litecoins were selling for 3&ndash;4 cents each, which means it was profitable
to mine. Depending on your cost for electricity, perhaps it never will be
profitable to mine Bitcoins or Litecoins. Again, I stress not to spend more
money than you can afford to lose. Still, if you're into cryptocurrencies,
it's a neat way to stress-test a computer!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Valta X79 is a screaming-fast computer. To be honest, if I were going
to build a powerhouse computer from scratch, it's the exact type of system
I would build. I think that's what I like best about it. ZaReason has
taken the essence of building your own computer, using standard parts,
and done the testing to make sure everything works well together. Then
ZaReason assembles it, configures it and, most important, supports it. If
you've ever wanted to build a custom system, but wished you didn't have
to give up a warranty and tech support, you'll love this Linux beast
from ZaReason. The price for the unit as reviewed is $2,396. To configure and price your own custom Valta X79, head
