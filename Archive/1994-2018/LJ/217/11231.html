An introduction to Pd&mdash;a graphic patching environment designed for audio
production and processing, with extensibility for the addition of other
media-related features.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad3300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
After reviewing recent trends in the world of SuperCollider3 for 
LinuxJournal.com, I decided to
investigate activity in the world of Pure Data, better known to its users
and abusers as Pd. However, instead of offering up yet another tutorial on
this or that aspect of Pd, I've opted for a nonlinear account of my
experience with the system. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad34b8"></a>
What Is Pure Data?</h2></div></div><p>
Pd often is described as an example of a &ldquo;visual programming
language&rdquo;, a
definition that is at least broad enough to avoid inaccuracy.
Personally, I define Pd as a graphic patching environment designed for audio
production and processing, with extensibility for the addition of other
media-related features, such as tools for processing images, text and
video. Pd's graphic patching capabilities consist of a small collection
of basic units&mdash;objects, messages, numbers, symbols and
comments&mdash;that
are placed on a canvas-like work area and graphically connected (patched)
into signal processing networks (Figure 1), a process similar to
constructing a sound-producing arrangement of modules on an old-school
modular patching synthesizer. Of course, Pd is a little more modern and a
lot more flexible. Its basic units are not predefined synthesis or audio
processing primitives. They can be those things (and much more), but
you need to define them as such, and you need to know what
definitions and values are allowable for each type of unit. Figure 1
illustrates a small Pd patch with four basic units and some typical values
in place.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11231f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Simple Pd Patch
</p></div></div><p>
This patch creates the sound of a sine wave at 338Hz. The waveform and its
amplitude are defaults for the osc~ object. The frequency value is supplied
by the number box. The dac~ audio output object receives sound data from
the osc~ object and can be switched on or off by clicking on the message
boxes. The GUI clearly indicates the connections between the patch's
components and the signal's path through them. The patch is complete, but
no amplitude envelope is present. When the Compute Audio button is checked,
the patch immediately will play at the default amplitude and continue until
switched off (the message box with the 0 value). 
</p><p>
The example is here merely to present a picture of Pd's GUI. I could go on
to add an envelope generator and an on/off switch, and I could proceed to
inform my readers about details like hot and cold inlets, the order of
the processing graph, how to add GUI elements and myriad other things
you can learn by studying Pd's extensive documentation.
</p><p>
Incidentally, many users hear about Pd with some reference to the famous
Max/MSP program commercially available from Cycling 74. The reference is
understandable&mdash;Miller Puckette, Pd's author, is also the author of the
original Max/MSP. I'm not sure why he would create an open-source
alternative to his (very successful) commercial software, but I'm
comfortable with his decision. In fact, Max/MSP and Pd are not identical
programs. The developers at Cycling 74 have created an environment related
to and similar to Pd in many ways, but it's not a for-sale version of Pd, and
Pd is not a free version of Max/MSP. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad38d8"></a>
The Flavors Menu</h2></div></div><p>
Pd comes in a variety of flavors, all based on the &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; Pd
release maintained by Miller Puckette. The other flavors differ primarily
in their packaged extensions and their GUI enhancements, but some deeper
changes may be made as well, typically to accommodate performance
requirements. Notable extensions to Pd include GEM (OpenGL graphics),
iemlib (library of GUI, math, filters and other DSP code), zexy (a package of
&ldquo;objects that provide functionality missing in plain Pd&rdquo;) and the
PDP/PiDiP/GridFlow packages (more tools for manipulating images and video).
Incidentally, the original vanilla GUI is built on Tk, a widget set
commonly associated with the Tcl scripting language. The unmodified
interface is certainly usable, but both the Pd-extended and Pd-L2Ork
Projects have contributed improvements to its appearance and usability.
</p><p>
The package repositories for many mainstream distributions include packages
for Pd in either the vanilla or Pd-extended flavors. The Pd-L2Ork Project
maintains packages for various Linux distributions, and of course, all
versions of Pd are available in source code packages. If you want to try
Pd in an optimized risk-free environment, check out the Puredyne
distribution. Puredyne is a live Linux system designed for multimedia
artists and musicians who want a fast, light system that's also loaded with
some of the best audio/video programs available in the free software
universe.
</p><p>
For my re-introduction to Pd, I decided to use the packages available from
the L2Ork site maintained by Professor Ivica Bukvic at Virginia Tech. This
flavor is based on the Pd-extended package, with customizations for the
hardware used by the L2Ork performance group. Pd-L2Ork includes almost all
the extra packages I needed for this article. The Tech group's flavor works
well, but I encountered some significant problems when I tried to run
examples from those extra libraries (see below).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad3bf0"></a>
Getting Into It</h2></div></div><p>
Regardless of which Pd package you choose, your first step into its world
should be taken in the Media menu. First, configure your audio and MIDI
devices&mdash;JACK audio and ALSA MIDI are recommended for Linux
users&mdash;then
select the Test Audio And MIDI item from the menu. This selection runs the
testtone.pd patch, a suite of tests to verify your audio/MIDI configuration
(Figure 2). When you're satisfied with its results, start opening
and running the example files found in /usr/lib/pd/doc/ or
/usr/local/lib/pd/doc/.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11231f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Pd's Audio/MIDI Test Suite
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad3eb0"></a>
Learning Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Searching on Google and Google Videos provides plenty of tutorials and
presentations on Pd (see Resources for some of my favorites); however,
Pd's on-line documentation is one of the system's great strengths. Cool and
useful example files abound in /usr/lib/pd/doc/ (or
/usr/local/lib/pd/doc/), complete and ready to run. They include a
wonderful variety of synthesis techniques, effects and dynamics processors,
GUI methods and so forth. I find the synthesis examples of special
interest. Many techniques are presented that are not so easily accessed in
other systems&mdash;for example, SSB modulation and four different FM synths. Users are
encouraged to use the example instruments as the basis for their own
instrument designs and compositions, a matter accomplished with simple
cut-and-paste operations. Editing patches is equally simple, with all edits
done directly on the patch canvas. Pd patches can be represented as
plain-text files, but they rarely are edited directly and more often are used for
exchanging patches between users. The GUI is where the editing action takes
place in Pd.
</p><p>
By the way, when you don't want to break your work flow to look up a
module's definition, simply right-click over any box to summon a pop-up menu
that includes a selection for the object's Help window. The Help file
describes the object's functions and provides a summary of its parameters.
New users should note that the Help file itself is an active patch, so be
careful about changing its default values. 
</p><p>
Given Pd's longevity, it's no surprise to find a rich set of third-party
resources for its study and expansion. If the program's own documentation
isn't enough, you can find a great FLOSS Pd manual on the Net, and other
Pd-oriented books abound (see Resources). I recommend especially
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing Sound</em></span>, by Andy Farnell. Apart from its great significance to
users of Pd, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing Sound</em></span> is a most engaging and deeply fascinating
book. Ostensibly targeted toward game sound designers, this book is a
treasure for anyone who works with digital audio. It covers a vast range of
subject material, all relevant to his topic at large, much of which is
potentially difficult to impart to a non-specialist reader. However, Mr
Farnell is a master of exposition and explanation, and I'm absorbed by
whatever I read in his book. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing Sound</em></span> has a particular appeal for Pd
people&mdash;every example in the book is presented in Pd, and although the
author states it is not a Pd tutorial, beginners may find his
presentation especially enjoyable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad4170"></a>
Making Connections</h2></div></div><p>
Pd loves external connections. Indeed, it's all just pure data to Pd&mdash;if
you can get the data into Pd, the program will make every attempt to
process it. That's good news for me, because I want to use it for
processing input from a variety of external devices.
</p><p>
For external MIDI control over my patches, I have a Behringer BCF2000
control surface and an Akai LPK25 2-octave keyboard, both of which were
instantly recognized by my Arch system and by QJackCtl. I used QJackCtl's
ALSA connections panel to hook the hardware into Pd where notein and ctlin
objects receive data from my MIDI hardware (Figure 3). Thus, when I move a
slider on the BCF, the slider in my Pd patch moves in smooth sync with the
hardware controller. I use the LPK to make sudden changes in visual
displays, and sometimes I use it simply to play notes into a Pd synthesizer
patch.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11231f3.large.jpg"><img src="11231f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Hardware Controller Inputs in a Pd Patch
</p></div></div><p>
I tested Pd's OSC support by connecting it to the IanniX OSC sequencer.
Thanks to user/developer codex99, I tested a pre-release of IanniX that
includes a neat example for working with Pd. The screenshot in Figure 4
shows the connection at work. Pd controls the speed of the sequencer while
IanniX controls the animation in the gemwin display window. It's all very
cool, and it opens the way to some fascinating possible uses. Perhaps you'd
like an OSC-enabled arrangement of Pd + IanniX + Ardour3? No problem, and
you might as well throw in connections with Processing and Renoise too,
perhaps with a machine per program and everything connected by
netsend/netreceive objects.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11231f4.large.jpg"><img src="11231f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Pd Plays with IanniX 
</p></div></div><p>
I also have a Webcam and a miniDV camera that I wanted to hook into Pd. As
I've noted already, Pd itself has no video processing capabilities, but
many of its externals are dedicated to visual data acquisition and massage.
The good news is that the physical connections&mdash;USB and FireWire ports and
drivers (V4L2 and IEEE1394)&mdash;are well supported by those externals. The
bad news is that I had to jump through more than a few hoops to make it all
work. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ad4748"></a>
Video Problems and Solutions</h2></div></div><p>
The packaged version of GEM worked well for everything except patches
involving my cameras. Video file playback worked well enough, but I had
troubles with live video input. Neither my Webcam nor my miniDV camera were
recognized, although both worked fine in the Cheese and Kino programs. A bit
of research led me to conclude that my installed version of GEM was borked,
so I decided to take the opportunity to upgrade. I built and installed GEM
0.93.3 (with support for its Pd external, of course), and my Webcam came
to life in my experiments with the pix_video module. Alas, my miniDV camera
remained moribund. Once again, a little research led to the discovery that
my Arch system's 3.0 kernel introduced some changes in its support for
FireWire devices. So, I ran this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 666 /dev/fw1
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I specified /dev/fw1 as my FireWire device for pix_video. When I
selected /dev/fw1 in my patch, the Pd console window complained with this
error message:


<pre     class="programlisting">
error: Cannot open '/dev/fw1': 25, Inappropriate ioctl for device
</pre>
</p><p>
However, the device worked perfectly in the patch, and now I have video I/O
for both devices.
</p><p>
PDP, PiDiP and GridFlow similarly were crippled by problems with the
relevant kernel modules. I rebuilt and re-installed all three externals, but
I also needed to change my patches to accommodate pd-v4l2 instead of
pd-v4l. At last, my test patch opened my Webcam with this series of
informative messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
Everything looked good up to this point, but then the console printed this
line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pdp_v4l2: unsupported color model: 1196444237
</pre>
</p><p>
My patch's rendering window opened, the Webcam's LED was on, but I had no
picture until I figured out that the &ldquo;unsupported color model&rdquo; resulted
from the MJPG format setting. I changed the format value to 1 (for YUYV
support), and voil&agrave;, my smiling face appeared in the patch's rendering
display. Finally, I have support for my Webcam in my Pd video patches.
Figure 5 shows the basic camera configuration for my PDP/PiDiP video
patches.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11231f5.large.jpg"><img src="11231f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The #dp-camera Abstraction
</p></div></div><p>
Incidentally, I use this patch now as an abstraction in my own versions of
the tutorial patches.
</p><p>
Alas, the situation with my miniDV camera is not so good. PDP/PiDiP
includes
the pdp_ieee1394 object, but it doesn't like /dev/fw1, and my Arch system
provides no other appropriate device node (such as /dev/dv1394). I ran Pd as
superuser, but still got no joy with the camera. I'll continue to search for a
solution, and in the meanwhile, I can use GEM when I want DV support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ecd128"></a>
It Takes Two</h2></div></div><p>
In one of my experiments, I created a patch that joined a video processor
with an audio synthesizer, both of which elements were controlled by a
single slider. The patch worked, but the video playback seriously
interfered with the audio continuity. Fortunately, I found a solution: I
separated the patch into two patches, then I ran those patches in two
instances of Pd, launching one instance with the -noaudio option for the
video processor and starting the other with the -rt flag for the audio
synthesis. Both patches include a ctlin object that receives data from a
slider on an external MIDI control surface (see above). With this
arrangement, the graphics are updated smoothly, and the audio playback
glitches are gone. This solution is not as elegant as the single-patch
design, but it's definitely the better performer on my aged single-core
CPU. I learned later that a two-machine solution is available with the
netsend/netreceive objects. I haven't tried it yet, but it's on my short
list of neat things to do with Pd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ecd230"></a>
The Pd Everywhere Project</h2></div></div><p>
Pd can be decoupled from its default GUI, a feature that has drawn the
attention of developers Peter Brinkmann and Peter Kirn. Thanks to their
libpd Project, Pd-based software can be run on mobile devices and systems,
such as the Android and the iOS. The library can be embedded directly into
devices, promising a new generation of Pd-based audio software for the
little and not-necessarily-so-little things. You can keep up with libpd's
development at the Pd Everywhere site and on Peter Brinkmann's blog (see
Resources). It's cool&mdash;check it out. 
</p><p>
As this article went to press, I received a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Musical
Apps: Real-Time Audio Synthesis on Android and iOS</em></span>, a new book written
by Peter Brinkmann. It's a must-have item if you're looking for a way to
use Linux to program audio applications for the new mobile devices. The
book has also persuaded me that I really need to get an Android.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ecd440"></a>
More Power Pd</h2></div></div><p>
Pd has its power users, and some of those users have Web sites dedicated
to their Pd-related productions and investigations. Frank Barknecht is a
true Pd wizard (and keen cyclist); you'll want to look at his footils.org
site and check out his work on the RRADical and RjDj Projects. Chris
McCormick's WebPd Project is very cool, as is his Squeakyshoecore music
(made with Pd, of course), and longtime user/developer Guenter Geiger 
recently has expanded his Pd-related work into the PDa (Puredata anywhere)
Project, an effort to bring Pd's power to Linux-friendly PDA devices.
</p><p>
Dr Albert Graef has lent his considerable talents to Pd in the form of his
Pd-Faust software. The project includes a new system for running Faust
plugins in Pd, with dynamic reloading and on-the-fly GUI generation. It's
available from the Pure Web site (see
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/Addons#pd-faust" target="_self">code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/Addons#pd-faust</a>) for further
details. Dr Graef notes that getting it all up and running may be a bit
tedious&mdash;it has dependencies not usually found in the average package
repos&mdash;but the latest release with all needed dependencies is available in
the PlanetCCRMA repository at
<a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetccrma/14/x86_64/repoview/pd-faust.html" target="_self">ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetccrma/14/x86_64/repoview/pd-faust.html</a>.
</p><p>
These days, it seems everyone wants to get in touch with Pd. I've
already noted that the Renoise tracker/DAW and the IanniX OSC sequencer
include examples for connecting those worthies to the power of Pd, and even
the mighty Csound provides a Csound-to-Pd bridge. These definitely are good
days, and good company, for Pd.
</p><p>
By the way, if you're looking for a quick introduction to some of Pd's
sonic capabilities, check out some of the offerings on Soundcloud
and the contributions at Puredata.info. Soundcloud's Pure Data community
has uploaded more than 60 recordings, and you're bound to find something of
interest there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29db580.0x2ecd700"></a>
The Wrap</h2></div></div><p>
As a veteran Csounder, I must say I am impressed with Pd's synthesis
capabilities. However, I also must confess that I'm most attracted to Pd
for its extended services, particularly in the graphics and video realms. I
continue to look into the possibilities of the PDP/PiDiP and GridFlow
packages, and I have so much more to learn about GEM's capabilities. I'm
also interested in using it for poetry and prose text manipulation&mdash;Pd is
that flexible, as evidenced by its many uses in real-world deployment.
