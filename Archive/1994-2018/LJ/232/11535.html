In this article, Reuven shows how to connect a simple Clojure Web app to a PostgreSQL
database.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18cb580.0x19c33b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I started discussing Compojure, a Web framework written
in the Clojure language. Clojure already has generated a great deal
of excitement among software developers, in that it combines the
beauty and expressive elegance of Lisp with the efficiency and
ubiquity of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Clojure has other traits
as well, including its famous use of software transactional memory
(STM) to avoid problems in multithreaded environments. 
</p><p>
As a Web developer and a longtime Lisp aficionado, I've been
intrigued by the possibility of writing and deploying Web applications
written in Clojure. Compojure would appear to be a simple framework
for creating Web applications, built on lower-level systems, such as
&ldquo;ring&rdquo;, which handles HTTP requests.
</p><p>
In my last article, I explained how to create a simple Web
application using the &ldquo;lein&rdquo; system, modify the project.clj
configuration file and determine the HTML returned in response to a
particular URL pattern (&ldquo;route&rdquo;). Here, I try to advance
the application somewhat, looking at the things that are typically of
interest to Web developers. Even if you don't end up using Clojure or
Compojure, I still think you'll learn something from understanding
how these systems approach the problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18cb580.0x19c3720"></a>
Databases and Clojure</h2></div></div><p>
Because Clojure is built on the JVM, you can use the same objects in
your Clojure program as you would in a Java program. In other words, if
you
want to connect to a PostgreSQL database, you do so with the same JDBC
driver that Java applications do.
</p><p>
Installing the PostgreSQL JDBC driver requires two steps. First, you
must download the driver, which is available at
<a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org" target="_self">jdbc.postgresql.org</a>. Second, you then must tell the JVM
where it can find the classes that are defined by the driver. This is
done by setting (or adding to) the CLASSPATH environment variable&mdash;that is, put the driver in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export CLASSPATH=/home/reuven/Downloads:$CLASSPATH
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have done that, you can tell your Clojure project that you want
to include the PostgreSQL JDBC driver by adding two elements to the
<tt  >:dependencies</tt> vector within the
<tt  >defproject</tt> macro:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defproject cjtest "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [compojure "1.1.5"]
                 [hiccup "1.0.3"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.2.3"]
                 [postgresql "9.1-901.jdbc4"]]
  :plugins [[lein-ring "0.8.5"]]
  :ring {:handler cjtest.handler/app}
  :profiles
  {:dev {:dependencies [[ring-mock "0.1.5"]]}})
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you just need to connect to the database, as well as interact with
it. Assuming you have created a database named &ldquo;cjtest&rdquo; on
your 
local PostgreSQL server, you can use the built-in Clojure REPL (<tt  >lein
repl</tt>) to talk to the database. First, you need to load the database
driver and put it into an &ldquo;sql&rdquo; namespace that will allow you to work
with the driver:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as sql])
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you need to tell Clojure the host, database and port to which you
want to connect. You can do this most easily by creating a
&ldquo;db&rdquo; map to
build the query string that PostgreSQL needs:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(def db {:classname "org.postgresql.Driver" 
	 :subprotocol "postgresql"
	 :subname (str "//" "localhost" ":" 5432 "/" "cjtest")
	 :user "reuven"
	 :password ""})
</pre>
</p><p>
With this in place, you now can issue database commands. The easiest
way to do so is to use the <tt  >with-connection</tt> macro inside the
&ldquo;sql&rdquo; namespace, which connects using the driver and then lets
you
issue a command. For example, if you want to create a new table
containing a serial (that is, automatically updated primary key) column
and a text column, you could do the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(sql/with-connection db 
    (sql/create-table :foo [:id :serial] [:stuff :text]))
</pre>
</p><p>
If you then check in psql, you'll see that the table has indeed been
created, using the types you specified. If you want to insert
data, you can do so with the <tt  >sql/insert-values</tt> function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(sql/with-connection db (sql/insert-values 
 &#8618;:foo [:stuff] ["first post"]))
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you get back the following map, indicating not only that the data was
inserted, but also that it automatically was given an ID by
PostgreSQL's sequence object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{:stuff "first post", :id 1}
</pre>
</p><p>
What if you want to retrieve all of the data you have inserted? You
can use the <tt  >sql/with-query-results</tt> function, iterating over the
results with the standard <tt  >doseq</tt> function:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(sql/with-connection db
    (sql/with-query-results resultset ["select * from foo"]
        (doseq [row resultset] (println row))))
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if you want only the contents of the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; column, you can use:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(sql/with-connection db
    (sql/with-query-results resultset ["select * from foo"]
        (doseq [row resultset] (println (:stuff row)))))
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18cb580.0x19c4488"></a>
Databases and Compojure</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know how to do basic database operations from the Clojure
REPL, you can put some of that code inside your Compojure
application. For example, let's say you want to have an
appointment calendar. For now, let's assume that there already is a
PostgreSQL &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; databases defined:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Appointments (
       id SERIAL,
       meeting_at TIMESTAMP,
       meeting_with TEXT,
       notes TEXT
);

INSERT INTO Appointments (meeting_at, meeting_with, notes) 
      VALUES ('2013-july-1 12:00', 'Mom', 'Always good to see Mom');
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll now want to be able to go to /appointments in your Web application
and see the current list of appointments. To do this, you need to
add a route to your Web application, such that it'll invoke a function
that then goes to the database and retrieves all of those elements.
</p><p>
Before you can do so, you need to load the PostgreSQL JDBC driver into
your Clojure application. You can do this most easily in the
<tt  >:require</tt>
section of your namespace declaration in handler.clj:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(ns cjtest.handler
  (:use compojure.core)
  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [clojure.java.jdbc :as sql]))
</pre>
</p><p>
(I did this manually in the REPL with the &ldquo;require&rdquo; function, with
slightly different syntax.)
</p><p>
You then include your same definition of &ldquo;db&rdquo; in handler.clj, such that
your database connection string still will be available.
</p><p>
Then, you add a new line to your <tt  >defroutes</tt> macro, adding a new
<tt  >/appointments</tt> URL, which will invoke the
<tt  >list-appointments</tt>
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (GET "/appointments" [] list-appointments)
  (GET "/fancy/:name" [name] say-hello)
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you define <tt  >list-appointments</tt>, a function
that executes an SQL
query and then grabs the resulting records and turns them into a
bulleted list in HTML:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn list-appointments
  [req]
  (html
   [:h1 "Current appointments"]
    [:ul
     (sql/with-connection db
         (sql/with-query-results rs ["select * from appointments"]
           (doall
            (map format-appointment rs))))]))
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that in a functional language like Clojure, the idea is to
get the results from the database and then process them in some way,
handing them off to another function for display (or further
processing). The above function produces HTML output, using the
Hiccup HTML-generation system. Using Hiccup, you easily can create (as
in the above function) an H1 headline, followed by a &ldquo;ul&rdquo; list.
</p><p>
The real magic happens in the call to
<tt  >sql/with-query-results</tt>. That
function puts the results of your database call in the
<tt  >rs</tt> variable.
You then can do a number of different things with that resultset. In
this case, let's turn each record into an &ldquo;li&rdquo; tag in the final
HTML. The easiest way to do that is to apply a function to each
element of the resultset. In Clojure (as in many functional
languages), you do this with the <tt  >map</tt> function, which transforms a
collection of items into a new collection of equal length. 
</p><p>
What does the <tt  >format-appointment</tt> function do? As you can imagine, it
turns an appointment record into HTML:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn format-appointment [one-appointment]
 (html [:li (:meeting_at one-appointment)
	 " : "
	 (:meeting_with one-appointment)
	 " (" (:notes one-appointment) ")" ]))
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, you'll treat the record as if it were a hash and then
retrieve the elements (keys) from that hash using Clojure's shorthand
syntax for doing so. You wrap that up into HTML, and then you can display
it for the user. The advantage of decomposing your display
functionality into two functions is that you now can change the way in
which appointments are displayed, without modifying the main function
that's called when /appointments is requested by the user.

Inserting Data</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you also want to insert data into your appointment book.
To do that, you need an HTML form that then submits itself to a URL
on your site. Let's first create a simple form&mdash;as always, written
as a function:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn new-meeting-form
  [ req ]
  (html [:form {:method "POST" :action "/create-meeting"}
         [:p "Meeting at (in 2013-06-28T11:08 format): " 
         &#8618;[:input {:type "text" :name "meeting_at"}]]
         [:p "Meeting with: " [:input {:type "text" 
          &#8618;:name "meeting_with"}]]
         [:p "Notes: " [:input {:type "text" :name "notes"}]]
         [:p [:input {:type "submit" :value "Add meeting"}]]]))
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the Hiccup library again lets you
define HTML tags easily.
In this case, because it's a form, you need to tell the form to which
URL it should be submitted. So in this example, that'll be the
/create-meeting URL. Thus, you need to define both /new-meeting and
/create-meeting in your <tt  >defroutes</tt> macro call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (GET "/meetings" [] list-meetings)
  (GET "/new-meeting" [] new-meeting-form)
  (POST "/create-meeting" [] create-meeting)
  (GET "/fancy/:name" [name] say-hello)
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the routes distinguish between GET and POST requests.
Thus, a GET request to /create-meeting will not have any effect (that is,
it
will result in the &ldquo;not found&rdquo; message being displayed); a POST
request is needed to make it work.
</p><p>
Everything comes together when you want to add a new meeting to your
database. You get the parameters from the submitted form and then
insert them into the database. 
</p><p>
I'm still learning about Clojure and
Compojure and continue to discover new libraries of functions that
can make it easier to create HTML forms and work with databases.
For example, I've recently discovered SQLKorma, a library that seems
almost like Ruby's ActiveRecord, in that it provides a DSL that
creates database queries.
</p><p>
The power of Clojure, like all Lisps, is partly based on the idea that
you do everything in small steps and then combine those steps for the
full power. Here, for example, is the function I wrote to add a
new record (meeting) to the database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn create-meeting
  [req]
  (sql/with-connection db
    (let [form-params (:form-params req)
          meeting-at-string (get form-params "meeting_at")
          meeting-at-parsed (clj-time.format/parse 
          &#8618;(clj-time.format/formatters
                   :date-hour-minute)
                   meeting-at-string)
          meeting-at-timestamp (clj-time.coerce/to-timestamp 
          &#8618;meeting-at-parsed)
          meeting-with (get form-params "meeting_with")
          notes (get form-params "notes")]
   (sql/insert-values :appointments
                      [:meeting_at :meeting_with :notes]
                      [meeting-at-timestamp meeting-with notes]))
    "Added!"))
</pre>
</p><p>
The first and final parts of the function are similar in many ways to
the database row insertion that you executed outside Compojure. You
use <tt  >sql/with-connection</tt> to connect to a database, and within that use
<tt  >sql/insert-values</tt> to insert a row into a specific table.
</p><p>
The interesting part of this function is, I believe, what happens in
the middle. Using the &ldquo;let&rdquo; form, which performs local bindings of
names to values, I can grab the values from the submitted HTML form
elements, preparing them for entry into the database.
</p><p>
I further take
advantage of the fact that Clojure's &ldquo;let&rdquo; allows you to bind names
based on previously bound names. Thus, I can set
<tt  >meeting-at-string</tt>
to the HTML form value, and then <tt  >meeting-at-parsed</tt> to the value I get
after converting the string to a parsed Clojure value, and then
<tt  >meeting-at-timestamp</tt> to turn it into a data type that both Clojure and
PostgreSQL can handle easily.
</p><p>
Much of the heavy lifting here is being done by the clj-time package,
which handles a wide variety of different date/time packages.
</p><p>
In the end, you're able to go to /new-meeting, enter appropriate data
into the HTML form and save that data to the database. You then
can go to /meetings and view the full list of meetings you have set.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I always have loved Lisp and often have wished I could find a
way to use it practically in my day-to-day work. (Not that I dislike
Ruby and Python, mind you, but the brainwashing I received in
college was quite effective.) Playing with Clojure as a language, and
Compojure to develop Web applications, has been a refreshing
experience&mdash;one that I intend to continue trying and that I
encourage you to attempt as well.
