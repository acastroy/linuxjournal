I've mentioned in years past that my programming skills started with
Pascal and ended with bubble sorting. My brain just doesn't seem wired to
write code. Perhaps when actual brain-wiring moves from science fiction to
the mainstream, I can upload something like, &ldquo;How to Program for
Neanderthals&rdquo;. Until that glorious cybernetic day, I'll continue to rely on
the skills of others.
</p><p>
One of those folks is Reuven M. Lerner, who month after month gives us new
insight into the programming world. This month, he expands on last issue's Clojure
article and discusses Compojure, which allows us to connect to a PostgreSQL
database. Our resident scripting expert, Dave Taylor, switches gears from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> in this issue. Dave has been dealing with
DDOS attacks of late, and he shares how
he's using a script to detect the attacks on his server. Whether or not his
attacker is an angry <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> player who can no longer beat his computer is
still unknown!

Kyle Rankin introduced us to DNSSEC last month, and now that we have an
understanding of how it works, he walks us through the process of
implementation. By the time you reach the end of Kyle's article, you'll likely
want to install DNSSEC for your domains. It's not the simplest technology
to implement, but Kyle's teaching makes it feasible for us all. I follow
Kyle's column with The Open-Source Classroom. Playing off last month's
Tomcat installation, I walk through setting up a reverse proxy with Apache.
Why add another layer of complexity to our server? Because running Tomcat
and a Web server on the same machine usually means applications have
nonstandard port numbers. With a reverse proxy, every application is a
virtual host&mdash;no special port numbers to remember!

Although it sounds more like a pirate's greeting than a programming tool,
Mihalis Tsoukalos shows us R this month. R is a statistical package that
offers some powerful tools, even for folks uncomfortable with mathematics
and statistics. Whether you prefer to see the raw numbers or look at
graphs generated to show your data, R is a tool everyone needing to sort
through data should look into. When it comes to tools of the trade, nothing
is more precious to a programmer than his or her text editor. Although vim is
all I need as a system administrator, if you spend eight hours a day working
with an editor, it should be one that makes your job easier. Ken Kinder
introduces the Sublime Editor this month. It's a cross-platform, proprietary
editor that offers a developer far more than syntax highlighting.

Arnold Robbins returns to a topic he covered a few years back by teaching
us even more tricks with gawk. If awk and sed are your bread and butter,
Arnold's article will feel like a home-cooked meal. Sushil Krishna
Bajracharya follows up with a great article on using code search to 
utilize your enterprise's code base better. All too often we re-invent the wheel
when it comes to programming because we don't know a solution already
has been written! If you ever feel like you're re-inventing the wheel inside a
wheel factory, Sushil's article is for you.

No programming issue would be complete without talking about programming
for mobile devices. When &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; and &ldquo;Phones&rdquo; are discussed, it seems that
99% of the time the discussion is about Android. Although awesome and
powerful, Android isn't the only mobile OS leveraging Linux. Ubuntu has a
mobile OS, Firefox has a mobile OS, and the world of Maemo/Moblin/Meego has
transformed into Tizen. Michael Schloh Von Bennewitz explains all about the
mobile platform you may not know about, but that has very deep roots in the
mobile world. If you think competition in the mobile OS world is a good
thing, check out Michael's article on Tizen, it's exciting stuff.

It's unlikely I'll be getting a cybernetic implant that allows me to
jumpstart a programming career; however, issues like this month's always excite me. I
enjoy reading about programming, and along with those focused articles, we
have product announcements, tech tips and other goodies
along the way. Oh, and to address the inevitable e-mail messages I'll get about
being a test case for the new cybernetic learning tool you're writing? I'll
wait for version 2.0, but thanks anyway.
