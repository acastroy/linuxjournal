Extract the wealth of knowledge trapped inside your code base.

When most people think about a company's reusable assets, source code
doesn't usually show up on the list, even though millions of dollars are
spent every year on creating and maintaining code. Most large companies are
managing hundreds of millions of lines of code&mdash;the majority of which was
purpose-built to solve a specific application problem. Most of that code is
locked up in source control management systems (SCMs) specific to an
application or a siloed organization.
</p><p>
Add to this the world of open-source software development where similarly
billions of lines of code exist, but where source code is shared publicly and
regularly reused&mdash;both wholesale and through forking. Here too, plenty of
effort and resources are spent in writing and maintaining source code. Source
code is maintained, extended and reused by a large number of developers. And,
like enterprise code, open-source code also is stored in various source code
repositories.
</p><p>
Collectively, the code that lives in internal SCMs across large organizations,
together with the billions of lines of code that exist in the open-source
world, reflect the implementation artifacts of literally millions of
developers. These artifacts can be used as powerful resources to assist with
the design, development, analysis and problem-solving of future applications.
</p><p>
But, how can we leverage this massive resource?

Code Search Engine</h2></div></div><p>
A code search engine is a tool that can help developers unlock the wealth of
diverse implementation knowledge buried inside large repositories. A code
search engine facilitates search operations that are specific to source code
and applies analysis and heuristics specific to source code while processing,
indexing and retrieving source code. A source code engine, unlike general
text-based search engines, is designed and implemented especially to cater to
developers' information needs related to source code. With these
features, a code search engine facilitates source code search.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca1580.0x1d99670"></a>
Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
Source code search (or simply, code search) is a technique to find relevant
source code in multiple source code repositories. Code search can help fulfill
commonly occurring search needs during development tasks, such as finding the
usage of APIs across different projects, finding how a known information
structure is implemented in code (such as base 64 encoding) and so on. What a
developer finds useful in code search results depends on the search need at
hand. An effective code search engine facilitates fulfilling such search needs
by delivering relevant results and providing the means to explore and narrow
down search results in cases where the need is vague and unclear. Given that
alternative choices are available in the results, a code search engine can act
as a choice engine by allowing code-specific faceting and filtering mechanisms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca1580.0x1d99778"></a>
Enterprise Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
Enterprise code search is code search as applied inside a company's
firewall, searching corporate source code repositories. Enterprise code search
must adhere to additional enterprise requirements, such as authorization and
access policies on source code visibility. This poses additional requirements
and challenges when considering a code search engine for an enterprise, since
the search tool has to meet the company's standards and needs to fit with
existing IT, enterprise tools and deployment procedures in place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca1580.0x1d99880"></a>
Use Cases for Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
Developers frequently use code search tools for copy-paste programming. Best
practices developers frequently seek to reuse existing solutions, and once
implemented, a common solution to a problem (such as a well-known algorithm)
can be used again and again. Copying and pasting code from an existing
solution, when legally permissible, often can be the most efficient approach,
saving developers time and resources to focus on more challenging tasks. A code
search engine can be an ideal tool to find such solutions. Although there 
certainly are reservations against practices like copy-paste programming, some
of which are reasonable (for example, one might not be able to trust
someone else's code blindly), code search engines deployed inside enterprises can
winnow down results to internal projects that reveal code written by experts,
helping to alleviate such concerns while still permitting the much-practiced
copy-paste programming.
</p><p>
Developers are not always looking for exact lines of code to copy and reuse.
More often they seek useful patterns they can add to their repertoire of
knowledge to solve recurring tasks. For example, while using APIs, developers
need to learn the patterns of API usage. Today's applications frequently
leverage API calls to other internal or external components. The typical API
has little documentation and few good examples, so it can be frustrating and
time-consuming for developers to figure out how to use them successfully. Two
easy answers to this problem would be either to enable developers to see
examples of how other developers have used an API or to provide visibility into
the code behind the API. To accomplish this, developers need an easy way to
search and view an API call or other code that calls the API. A code search
engine allows developers to accomplish this task easily. Code samples and
examples are vital learning tools for developers who often will copy and modify
existing examples to fit their purposes. A code search engine lets developers
use existing code repositories as sources of examples&mdash;in the above case,
sources of API usage examples.
</p><p>
A code search engine can be helpful in various other scenarios.
When starting a new project with new languages and frameworks, developers would
benefit by researching and studying the code bases of mature projects using the
same languages and frameworks. Open-source implementations can be a great way
for developers to learn solutions to complex computing problems, such as
implementing distributed systems, search engines, network servers and so on. Code
search engines in the enterprise also can be extremely helpful during normal
development activities, such as maintenance, porting and working with legacy
code. Code search engines can be used to index and cross-link files spanning
multiple types and languages, thus supporting traceability in the search
results. Developers can use code search during maintenance to find source
files, unit tests and configuration files related to a particular feature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca1580.0x1d99a90"></a>
Challenges in Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
The use cases presented above demonstrate the potential benefits of a code
search engine, but these benefits cannot be realized unless the code search
engine is effective and efficient. Code search results must be relevant,
comprehensive and meet the users' information need for the tool to be
effective. It must be designed with the features and capabilities needed by a
wide range of developers who are under constant pressure to work more
efficiently and cost effectively. To be efficient, the code search solution
must be capable of delivering effective results within acceptable response
times by having the capacity to scale to very large repositories.
</p><p>
Source code, unlike plain or natural language text, tends to be very sparse.
This poses a serious challenge in building effective code search engines if one
resorts only to techniques that work for natural text. The lack of rich
vocabulary in code has to be compensated with additional attributes that can be
leveraged and would exist only in source code. One such attribute is the rich
structural information that exists in source code. Unlike natural text, source
code is highly structured with definitions of various nested elements and
relations between these elements. For example, in a typical object-oriented
program, one would find classes and methods, where classes extend to other
classes, and method calls to other methods. A code search engine needs to parse
source code to extract such elements to provide search operators that
specifically allow the retrieval of these elements. For example, when a
developer needs to find a certain method name, an operator (such as
<tt  >mdef</tt> in ohloh.code) easily can deliver effective search results on
such a query.
</p><p>
This rich interlinked structure relates several elements with one another and
can be the basis of accumulating similar terms when vocabulary is sparse.
Similar to the Web, the link structure in code itself can be used to build new
metrics of popularity and ranking, if used properly. There are several
conventions (such as naming conventions) found in source code writing that are
uncommon in natural text that make special tokenization and processing
suitable for source code. (To learn more about these topics, refer to
the author's doctoral dissertation: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Facilitating Internet-Scale Code
Retrieval</em></span> at <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2019966" target="_self">dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2019966</a>.)
</p><p>
For proper extraction of elements in source code and relations among such
elements, a code search engine first needs to be able to detect the
implementation language and perform detailed parsing of the code, which can be
nontrivial for complex languages and for repositories where erroneous or
incomplete code exists.
</p><p>
Beyond lexical and structural properties, source code has executable properties
making it an executable artifact with runtime behaviors that change as the code
evolves. Understanding such behavior is vital to activities like fixing bugs
or improving performance. A code search engine can leverage the stored
representations of runtime behavior as captured in test coverage reports, call
traces, profiling outputs and logs, and relate them with appropriate elements
defined in source code to provide answers related to unexpected behavior in
code.
</p><p>
Finally, being produced and maintained by developers who work collaboratively,
source code even has human-centric attributes. Since most of the activities on
source code are logged in source repositories, a source code engine can tap
into information connected to such activities to provide answers related to
developers and their activities when needed. For example, it can help find
an expert on a certain feature, or a developer tasked with managing a specific
project can be notified when a certain portion of the code in question is
changed.
</p><p>
An effective code search engine allows developers to extract, represent, store,
mine and use these source code-specific attributes irrespective of the scale
at which all such attributes can expand in size when applied to enterprise or
Internet-scale source code repositories.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca1580.0x1d99f08"></a>
What's Different in Enterprise Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
There are some important differences between enterprise and open-source code
search. Open-source code search is done over code repositories found on the
Internet and can be seen as an instance of Internet code
search&mdash;developers searching for code on the Internet. Results can vary widely when
searching one's own enterprise code base compared to searching open-source
repositories. Inside an enterprise, it's likely there are more stringent
code quality checks, better practices for using APIs and stricter code
authorship attribution. These are just a few of the factors that can influence
the examples developers can find when searching their enterprise code bases.
</p><p>
From a tool-builder's perspective, additional benefits of enterprise code
search include tighter integration with ALM tools. Tool builders also can use
code search to conduct more accurate analyses during indexing, because code in
enterprise source code repositories could be quality controlled or automated to
prevent erroneous and incomplete check-ins. In short, there are even more
opportunities for us to explore leveraging the unique aspects of enterprise
code base.

Measuring the Benefits of Enterprise Code Search</h2></div></div><p>
The usage of enterprise code search engines is still in the early adoption
phase, so measuring the benefits can be a challenge. Without hard empirical
data, these benefits are difficult to quantify but not impossible. Following
are examples of how enterprises can assess the benefits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
As a productivity tool for developers:
how much time and effort is spent on questions about code every day? How long
does a developer have to wait to get an answer? How much time and effort could
a developer save with code search tools, not only herself, but also for other
members of the development team who collaborate with her and each other on a
daily basis?
With a code search tool, many such delays could be avoided, saving the valuable
time of not only one but many developers.
</p></li><li><p>
Value of code search engine as a knowledge-enhancing tool:
enhancing one's own knowledge is certainly invaluable, and if a code search
engine works as a knowledge-building tool for developers, its value is already
justified. To developers, source code is their literature, and a code search
engine can act as a tool to navigate and master such literature.
</p></li><li><p>
More quantitative measures:
there can be more quantitative and long-term means of measuring the benefits of
a code search engine. Detailed tracking and logging of activities in the code
search engine can lead to quantifiable discoveries of code reuse. Looking at
activities over time (as permitted by honoring privacy concerns), such as
searches, downloads and copy-paste events, enterprises can gain invaluable
insights into their code base that can be applied to improving
developer efficiency and software performance proactively. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Overall, as a team or a company, one can devise a strategy to measure the
benefits of a code search tool by looking at things one can quantify, such
as logs, and
by understanding benefits that could be qualitative&mdash;by asking the
end users, developers, managers and other collaborators to share how these
tools benefit them individually and as a group.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Leveraging code artifacts from other developers can open up new opportunities
for learning, code reuse and lowering the time and cost of software
development and maintenance. The ability to search collections of large
code repositories rapidly is fundamental to realizing these benefits. By putting more
focus on leveraging code as a valuable learning asset, we can build upon the
collective experiences within our industry to work more efficiently as
innovators in developing new code.
