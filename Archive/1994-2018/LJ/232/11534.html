Serve all your Web applications through a single server&mdash;no more
port numbers!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16ed358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I discussed Apache Tomcat, which is the ideal way to run
Java applications from your server. I explained that you can run those
apps from Tomcat's default 8080 port, or you can configure Tomcat to use
port 80. But, what if you want to run a traditional Web server
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> host
Java apps on port 80? The answer is to run a reverse proxy.
</p><p>
The only assumption I make here is that you have a Web-based application
running on a port other than port 80. This can be a Tomcat app, like I
discussed in my last article, or it can be any Web application that has
its interface via the Web (such as Transmission, Sick Beard and so on). The other
scenario I cover here is running a Web app from a second server, even if
it's on port 80, but you want it to be accessed from your central Web
server. (This is particularly useful if you have only one static IP to
use for hosting.)
</p><p>
The way reverse proxying works, at least with the Apache Web server, is
that every application is configured as a virtual host. Just like you can
host multiple Web sites from a single server using virtual hosting, you 
also can host separate Web apps as virtual hosts from that same
server. It's
not terribly difficult to configure, but it's very useful in practice. First
things first. On your server, you have the Web server installed
(Figure 1). You also have a Web application on port 8080 (Figure 2).
Along with the working Apache Web server, you need to make sure virtual
hosting (by name) is enabled.

Enabling Name-Based Virtual Hosts</h2></div></div><p>
Enabling name-based virtual hosting on Apache is extremely common,
and it's very simple to do. Depending on what distribution you're using,
the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; location for enabling name-based virtual hosting may
differ. The nice thing about Apache, however, is that generally as long
as the directive is specified somewhere in the configurations, Apache
will honor it.
</p><p>
My local test server is running Ubuntu. In order to determine where the
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; place to enable name-based virtual hosting is, I simply went to
the /etc/apache2 directory and executed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep NameVirtualHost *
</pre>
</p><p>
That command searches for the <tt  >NameVirtualHost</tt>
directive, and it returned this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@server:/etc/apache2# grep NameVirtualHost *
ports.conf:NameVirtualHost *:80
ports.conf:    # If you add NameVirtualHost *:443 here, 
               # you will also have to change
</pre>
</p><p>
Those results tell me that the <tt  >NameVirtualHost</tt> directive is specified
in the /etc/apache2/ports.conf file. (Note that grep will return
only the lines that
contain the search term, which is why it shows those two
out-of-context lines above. The important thing is the filename
ports.conf, which is what I was looking for.) Again, with Apache, it generally
doesn't matter where you specify directives, but I like to stick with
the standards of the particular distribution I'm using, if only
for the sake of future administrators.
</p><p>
To enable name-based virtual hosting, you simply uncomment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
NameVirtualHost *:80
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16edeb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
from the file, and save it. If you can't find a file that contains such
a directive commented out, just add the line to your apache.conf or
httpd.conf file. Then you need to specify a VirtualHost directive for
the virtual host you want to create. This process is the same whether
you're making a traditional virtual host or a reverse proxy virtual host.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16edfb8"></a>
Creating a Virtual Host</h2></div></div><p>
As in the previous section of this article, it's important to note that the Apache configuration
file layout will vary with distributions. In Ubuntu, there are two
folders: sites-available and sites-enabled.
The first has text files with snippets of code defining the individual
virtual hosts, and the second has symbolic links to the files located in
the sites-available folder. This seems complicated to be sure, but it's
actually for convenience sake. You can define as many virtual hosts as
you want in the sites-available folder, but until they're symbolically
linked into the sites-enabled folder, they're not parsed by
Apache.
</p><p>
Let's create a virtual host, but instead of making a
traditional virtual host that defines a directory to look for files,
let's define reverse proxy rules. Here is the file I created
in sites-available (I explain each line next):


<pre     class="programlisting">

root@server:/etc/apache2# cat sites-available/reverseprox 
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
        LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
        ServerName sab.mydomain.com
        ServerAlias sab
        ProxyRequests Off 
        ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.11:8080/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.11:8080/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
First off, if it's not clear, the name of the file I created is
&ldquo;reverseprox&rdquo;, and I created it in the /etc/apache2/sites-available
folder. If you are using a different distribution, you may not have this
sort of folder setup. You actually can add the VirtualHost directives
directly to the apache.conf or httpd.conf file. Ubuntu just uses the
folder structure for clarity and convenience.
</p><p>
Here's the line-by-line breakdown:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</tt> &mdash;
this opens the stanza, and it means &ldquo;listen on all IP addresses on port 80
for anyone requesting my server name&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so</tt> and
<tt  >LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so</tt>
&mdash;
these lines load two separate modules. Note that although the module
names look similar, they actually are two modules: mod_proxy and
mod_proxy_http. Sometimes modules are loaded globally in another
configuration file. That's okay to do, but this is just a way to make sure
the required modules are loaded for your virtual host. (Note: if you get an
error about &ldquo;file not found&rdquo; during startup, you might need to
make a symbolic link to your system's modules folder. On my Ubuntu system,
that means <tt  >sudo ln -s /usr/lib/apache2/modules
/etc/apache2/</tt>.)
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ServerName sab.mydomain.com</tt> &mdash;
this is the domain name the virtual host should listen for. If a request
comes into Apache for &ldquo;sab.mydomain.com&rdquo;, it knows to use this virtual
host declaration to respond. Of course, &ldquo;sab.mydomain.com&rdquo; is a generic
example; you should use your actual domain name.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ServerAlias sab</tt> &mdash;
it's possible to have multiple <tt  >ServerAlias</tt> statements, but in this case,
there's only one. I've added &ldquo;sab&rdquo; all by itself as an alias for Apache
to listen for. It will use a request for &ldquo;sab&rdquo; the same way it uses a
request for &ldquo;sab.mydomain.com&rdquo;&mdash;this is simply an alias.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ProxyRequests Off</tt> &mdash;
this is actually the default setting for the ProxyRequests directive. I
always add it to my VirtualHost stanza anyway to make sure I'm
not inadvertently allowing someone to use my server as an anonymous
proxy. <tt  >ProxyRequests On</tt> would allow others with access to your server
to use it as a proxy, effectively hiding themselves from the Internet
and making you responsible for their surfing! Hopefully, it's clear why
I specify &ldquo;Off&rdquo;, even though it's the default setting.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.11:8080/</tt> &mdash;
this tells Apache that when someone requests the root-level folder of this
virtual host to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; them the address listed. From end users'
prospectives, the alternate port, and possibly the alternate server address,
will be hidden. They'll see only the URL they entered to get to the
virtual host. You can have multiple ProxyPass directives if you want
a specific subfolder to be directed elsewhere. Apache is very flexible
with what you can specify in a reverse proxy situation.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.11:8080/</tt> &mdash;
this rule is what makes the reverse proxy work. It rewrites the response
from the proxied server so that end users never see any information
apart from the virtual hostname they've surfed to. Any responses from
the underlying server (in this case, the server listening on port 8080)
are rewritten on the fly so that it appears that the responses are coming
directly from the virtual host server.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</tt> &mdash;
this closes the stanza, or the section defining the virtual host. In
Ubuntu, this is a single file in the sites-available folder. It also could
just be something tacked onto the end of the apache.conf file in
another distribution.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x1ae7288"></a>
Making It All Work</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've created the virtual host declaration for the reverse proxy
site, you need to reload Apache. Remember, if you're using Ubuntu, you
need to create a symbolic link so that Apache reads your configuration
from the sites-enabled folder. To do that, go into the sites-enabled
folder, and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s ../sites-available/reverseprox .
</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a symbolic link from the reverseprox file you created
to the sites-available folder. If you're using another distribution and
just tacked that stanza to the end of the apache.conf file, you don't
need to make any symbolic links.
</p><p>
Next, reload Apache. I actually prefer to restart Apache to make sure
it loads up everything correctly, but a reload should do the trick. In
Ubuntu, I do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service apache2 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the reverse proxy should be ready to go. You just need to make sure
your DNS points correctly to the server. The quickest way to do that, and
make sure stuff is working, is to add a simple line to your workstation's
/etc/hosts file. I added this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.11     sab sab.mydomain.com
</pre>
</p><p>
And, then I saved it. Next, I opened a browser, and surfed to
&ldquo;sab&rdquo; instead of
192.168.1.11:8080, and Figure 3 shows the results. Success!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11534f3.large.jpg"><img src="11534f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Now I can access that Web application without entering any
port number at all! Plus, it gets its own domain name!
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x1ae7808"></a>
Now What?</h2></div></div><p>
The great thing about using Apache's reverse proxy technique is that
you're not limited to redirecting only to the same server on a different
port. You can make a reverse proxy so that google.yourdomain.com returns
the actual Google search engine. You'll just create a virtual host
for google.yourdomain.com, and set the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse
directives to point to http://www.google.com/. It's truly simple. In
fact, a reverse proxy on your local network might be a way to provide
access to an otherwise blocked Web site for your users. What if your
Web-filtering policies blocked a particular news site, but your server
had access? You could create a reverse proxy on your server that your
users could connect to and get to the site without being filtered by your
Web filter! (Another word of caution: this is why it's important to set
ProxyRequests to Off, so they don't use your reverse proxy to circumvent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> Web filtering!)
</p><p>
With reverse proxies, it's possible to make your Web infrastructure much
less confusing for your end users. It also allows you to make changes
to your underlying Web apps without affecting your users at all. If a
service changes IP addresses or ports, you simply can adjust your reverse
proxy definitions, and end users never will know the difference. Reverse
proxies are easy to configure and simple to maintain. They will help keep
your URLs clean and your systems easy to manage!
