Phew. I'm done with that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> game coding, after months of shell script
programming in directions doubtless unanticipated by the original Bash authors.
It mostly worked, but after publishing last month's column, I did realize there
are a few niggling bugs in the scoring code. Those, however, are now an exercise
for you, dear reader, to identify and fix. Because you need homework, right?
</p><p>
During the past month or so, I've also been dealing with an aggressive DDOS
(that's a &ldquo;distributed denial of service&rdquo;) attack on my server, one
that's been a huge pain, as you might expect. What's odd is that with
multiple domains on the same server, it's one of my less-popular sites that
seems to have been the target of the attacks.
</p><p>
So, that's the jumping off point for this article's scripts: analyzing log
files to understand what's going on and why.
</p><p>
To start, a handy check is to see how many
processes are running, because my DDOS
was characterized by a ridiculous number of comment and search scripts being
triggered&mdash;hundreds a minute. How to check?
</p><p>
The <tt  >ps</tt> command offers a list of running processes at any given time,
but for many versions, all you see is the Web server &ldquo;httpd&rdquo; without any
further details. The <tt  >-C cmd</tt> flag narrows down output only to those
processes, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

: ps -C httpd
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
20225 ?        00:13:21 httpd
28162 ?        00:00:01 httpd
...
5681 ?        00:00:00 httpd
5683 ?        00:00:00 httpd &lt;defunct&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
(Note the &ldquo;defunct&rdquo; process that's about to vanish.)
</p><p>
So one easy test is to see how many httpd processes are running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ps -C httpd | wc -l
108
</pre>
</p><p>
That seems like a lot, but this server is hosting several sites, including the
super-busy AskDaveTaylor.com tech-support site, which sees more than 100k hits/day. So
how does this vary over time? Hmm...still working on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ while /bin/true
&gt; do
&gt;   ps -C httpd | wc -l
&gt;   sleep 5
&gt; done
108
107
103
99
94
91
87
84
91
121
120
116
</pre>
</p><p>
So there's a max of 121 and a min of 87. But, what if I actually want to analyze this and
get min, max and average over a longer period of time?
Here's how I solve it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Calculates the number of processes running that matches
#   a set pattern over time, producing min, max and average.
min=999; max=0; average=0; tally=0; sumtotal=0
pattern="httpd"  # ps -C pattern
while /bin/true
do
  count=$(ps -C $pattern | wc -l)
  tally=$(( $tally + 1 ))
  if [ $count -gt $max ] ; then
    max=$count
  fi
  if [ $count -lt $min ] ; then
    min=$count
  fi
  sumtotal=$(( $sumtotal + $count ))
  average=$(( $sumtotal / $tally ))
  echo "Current ps count=$count: min=$min, max=$max, tally=$tally 
  &#8618;and average=$average"
  sleep 5 # seconds
done
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice in the script that I'm not falling into the trap of calculating the
average by having a running average and somehow factoring in the latest value as
a diminishing additive, but instead I use a <tt  >sumtotal</tt> variable that keeps
having the latest processor count added. That divided by
<tt  >tally</tt> is
always the average, although at some point this probably would be greater than
MAXINT (2**32) and would start to produce bad results. On a modern computer,
however, that should take a while. (And the quantum, the period of time between
iterations, also can be adjusted. Five seconds might be too granular for a
process that's going to be run for hours or even days.)
</p><p>
The following are the first few lines of output. Notice how the <tt  >min</tt>
and
<tt  >max</tt> vary as the different values are calculated:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sh processes.sh
Current ps count=132: min=132, max=132, tally=1 and average=132
Current ps count=128: min=128, max=132, tally=2 and average=130
Current ps count=124: min=124, max=132, tally=3 and average=128
Current ps count=123: min=123, max=132, tally=4 and average=126
</pre>
</p><p>
If I let the script run for a longer period of time, the values become a bit more
varied:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Current ps count=90: min=76, max=150, tally=70 and average=107
</pre>
</p><p>
During the 15 minutes or so that I ran the script, an average of 107
&ldquo;httpd&rdquo; processes were running, with a minimum of 76 and a max of 150.
</p><p>
Armed with that information, another script could keep an eye on things via a
cron job, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# DDOS - keep an eye on process count to 
# detect a blossoming DDOS attack
pattern="httpd"
max=200   # avoid false positives
admin="d1taylor@gmail.com"
count="$(ps -C $pattern | wc -l)"
if [ $count -gt $max ] ; then
  echo "Warning: DDOS in process? Current httpd count = 
  &#8618;$count" | sendmail $admin
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a superficial solution, however, and it has two problems:
1) what I'd really like is to be able to identify the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> DDOS based
on processor count and watch to see if it's sustained over the next few
invocations of the script, and 2) once it's triggered, if it is a DDOS, in
addition to everything else, I'll also start drowning in e-mail from this
script saying essentially the same thing each time. Not good.
</p><p>
What the script needs is contextual memory so it can differentiate between a
sudden spike in traffic and a persistent DDOS attack. In the former case, the
script might trigger positive, then the next time it runs, it's all within
acceptable limits again. In the latter case, once the attack starts, it'll
probably just accelerate.
</p><p>
That's the opposite of the e-mail non-repeat condition though, because in the
latter case, I want to know that the e-mail has been sent and not send it again
within, say, a 60-minute window.
</p><p>
I'll dig in to both of those situations next month. For now, I need to get
back to my server and keep bringing things back on-line, program by program, to
try to avoid any problems.
Stay tuned!
