<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #232, August 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Union filesystems</b></span> don't have much luck with the kernel development process.
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> recently tried to get
<span   class="bold"><b>OverlayFS</b></span> into the main tree, but he ran
into a wall in the form of <span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> initially responded to
Miklos' request with, &ldquo;I think we should just do it. It's in use, it's
pretty small, and the other alternatives are worse.&rdquo; But when Al started
reviewing the code, he found that the underlying filesystem operations were
simply way too fragile to support users. Even simple operations like
deleting a directory tree would be fraught with messy details that could
leave the whole filesystem in an inconsistent state in the event of any
interruption. In the end, he couldn't let the code pass through the gates.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Phillips</b></span> made some extravagant
claims about <span   class="bold"><b>Tux3</b></span> performance
recently, and he got slapped around by some kernel folks for it.
Apparently,
Tux3 had outperformed <span   class="bold"><b>tmpFS</b></span> on some particular benchmarks, and Daniel was
crowing about it on the mailing list. But after folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Chinner</b></span>
took a look at the actual numbers, it became clear that the benchmark was
unreproducible, and had been specifically engineered to measure only the
asynchronous front end of Tux3, so that all the time-consuming hard work
behind the scenes never actually was included in the benchmark. There was
some grumbling from kernel developers about this, while Daniel argued that
the benchmark tested only portions of the code that already had been
implemented and that other tests would be done as more of the code was
written. Clearly, there are two sides to the story. But as Dave Chinner put
it, benchmarks should at least include enough information to reproduce the
results.
</p><p>
How should Linux handle <span   class="bold"><b>empty symlinks</b></span>? At the moment, Linux doesn't allow
users to create them, so you might think there's no problem&mdash;if they can't
exist, there's no need to handle them one way or another. But, nothing
prevents someone from mounting a filesystem that was created on an
operating system that does allow empty symlinks. So evidently, there
really is a need to handle them properly if they ever appear.
</p><p>
As it turns out, Linux's current behavior is not very well known regarding
this issue. <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> started exploring the various ins and outs of it,
but the full scope and nuance may take a while to dig out. But, thanks to
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric Blake</b></span>'s cogent arguing, it's clear that something does need to be
done. This is a case of <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX
noncompliance</b></span> that actually may burn some
people, as opposed to the cases of POSIX noncompliance that Linus Torvalds
doesn't care about at all, in any way whatsoever. As far as Linus is
concerned, if it doesn't hurt anyone, it's not a bug. If there's a way to
improve on POSIX, then POSIX is the bug. But this time, it may be that
POSIX isn't the bug, and the bug does bite.
</p><p>
Once in a while the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL v2</b></span> becomes the
topic of debate. This time, <span   class="bold"><b>Luke
Leighton</b></span> posted to the mailing list, saying that he wanted all his kernel
contributions to be dual-licensed under the GPL v2 and the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL v3</b></span> (and all
subsequent versions). But, <span   class="bold"><b>Cole Johnson</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Ts'o</b></span> pointed out that
Linus Torvalds, and many other top kernel people, very vocally had rejected
the GPL v3 for the Linux kernel. Theodore said, &ldquo;the anti-Tivoization
clause in GPLv3 is totally unacceptable, and so many of us have stated
unequivocally that our code will be released under a GPLv2-only license.
This means that GPLv3-only code is always going to be incompatible with
code released as part of the Linux kernel, because substantial parts of the
kernel have and will be available only under a GPLv2-only license.&rdquo;
</p><p>
At one point in the conversation, <span   class="bold"><b>Rob
Landley</b></span> said that the loss of
compatibilities between the GPL v2 and v3 had ruined
&ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;. He said,
&ldquo;These days the GPL largely serves to <span   class="emphasis"><em>prevent</em></span> code re-use, and people
have responded to the perceived problems with 'GPL-next' initiatives where
they fragment copyleft further with Affero variants, by using creative
commons on code, and so on. But copyleft only ever worked as one big
universal license, and now it doesn't.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He added, &ldquo;In the absence of a universal receiver, most developers have
switched to universal donor licenses: MIT/BSD or even public domain. Yes,
'most': the most common license on GitHub is 'no license specified', and
that's not just ignorance, that's napster-style civil disobedience from a
generation of coders who lump copyright in with software patents and
consider it all 'too dumb to live'.&rdquo;
</p><p>
A bleak assessment.

<h2 class="title">Advanced OpenMP</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #232, August 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Because this issue's theme is programming, I thought I should cover some
of the more-advanced features available in OpenMP. Several issues ago,
I looked at the basics of using OpenMP (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/big-box-science" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/big-box-science</a>), so you may want go
back and review that article.
In scientific programming, the basics tend to be the limit of how
people use OpenMP, but there is so much more available&mdash;and, these other
features are useful for so much more than just scientific computing. So, in
this article,
I delve into other by-waters that never seem to
be covered when looking at OpenMP programming. Who knows, you may even
replace POSIX threads with OpenMP.
</p><p>
First, let me quickly review a little bit of the basics of OpenMP. All
of the examples below are done in C. If you remember, OpenMP is
defined as a set of instructions to the compiler. This means you need
a compiler that supports OpenMP. The instructions to the compiler are
given through pragmas. These pragmas are defined such that they appear
as comments to a compiler that doesn't support OpenMP. 
</p><p>
The most typical
construct is to use a for loop. Say you want to create an array of the
sines of the integers from 1 to some maximum value. It would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i&lt;max; i++) {
   a[i] = sin(i);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Then you would compile this with GCC by using the
<tt  >-fopenmp</tt> flag. Although
this works great for problems that naturally form themselves into
algorithms around for loops, this is far from the majority of solution
schemes. In most cases, you need to be more flexible in your program
design to handle more complicated parallel algorithms. To do this in
OpenMP, enter the constructs of sections and tasks. With these, you
should be able to do almost anything you would do with POSIX threads.
</p><p>
First, let's look at sections. In the OpenMP specification, sections are
defined as sequential blocks of code that can be run in parallel. You
define them with a nested structure of pragma statements. The outer-most
layer is the pragma:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp parallel sections
{
   ...commands...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that pragmas apply only to the next code block in C. Most simply,
this means the next line of code. If you need to use more than one line,
you need to wrap them in curly braces, as shown above. This pragma forks
off a number of new threads to handle the parallelized code. The number
of threads that are created depends on what you set in the environment
variable <tt  >OMP_NUM_THREADS</tt>. So, if you want to use four threads, you
would execute the following at the command line before running your program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
</pre>
</p><p>
Inside the sections
region, you need to define a series of individual section
regions. Each of these is defined by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp section
{
   ...commands...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This should look familiar to anyone who has used MPI before. What you end
up with is a series of independent blocks of code that can be run in
parallel. Say you defined four threads to be used for your program. This
means you can have up to four section regions running in parallel. If
you have more than four defined in your code, OpenMP will manage running
them as quickly as possible, farming remaining section regions out to the
running threads as soon as they become free. 
</p><p>
As a more complete example,
let's say you have an array of numbers and you want to find the sine,
cosine and tangents of the values stored there. You could create three
section regions to do all three steps in parallel:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel sections
{
#pragma omp section
for (i=0; i&lt;max, i++) {
   sines[i] = sin(A[i]);
}
#pragma omp section
for (j=0; j&lt;max; j++) {
   cosines[j] = cos(A[j]);
}
#pragma omp section
for (k=0; k&lt;max; k++) {
   tangents[k] = tan(A[k]);
}
}

</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, each of the section regions has a single code block
defined by the for loop. Therefore, you don't need to wrap them in curly
braces. You also should have noticed that each for loop uses a separate
loop index variable. Remember that OpenMP is a shared memory
parallel programming model, so all threads can see, and write to, all
global variables. So if you use variables that are created outside the
parallel region, you need to avoid multiple threads writing to the same
variable. If this does happen, it's called a race condition. It might
also be called the bane of the parallel programmer.
</p><p>
The second construct I want to look at in this article is the task. Tasks in
OpenMP are even more unstructured than sections. Section regions need
to be grouped together into a single sections region, and this entire
region gets parallelized. With tasks, they are dumped onto a queue,
ready to run as soon as possible. Defining a task is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp task
{
...commands...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In your code, you would create a general parallel region with the pragma:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp parallel
</pre>
</p><p>
This pragma forks off the number of threads that you set in the
<tt  >OMP_NUM_THREADS</tt> environment variable. These threads
form a pool that is
available to be used by other parallel constructs. 
</p><p>
Now, when you create
a new task, one of three things might happen. The first is that there is
a free thread from the pool. In this case, OpenMP will have that free
thread run the code in the task construct. The second and third cases
are that there are no free threads available. In these cases, the task
may end up being scheduled to run by the originating thread, or it may
end up being queued up to run as soon as a thread becomes free. 
</p><p>
So, let's
say you have a function (called func) that you want to call with
five different parameters, such that they are independent, and you want to
have them run in parallel. You can do this with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel
{
for (i=1; i&lt;6; i++) {
#pragma omp task
   func(i);
}
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a thread pool, and then loop through the for loop and
create five tasks to farm out to the thread pool. One cool thing about tasks
is that you have a bit more control over how they are scheduled. If
you reach a point in your task where you can go to sleep for a while,
you actually can tell OpenMP to do that. You can use the pragma:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp taskyield
</pre>
</p><p>
When the currently running thread reaches this point in your code,
it will stop and check the task queue to see if there are any waiting
to run. If so, it will go ahead and start one of those and put your
current task to sleep. When the new task finishes, the suspended task
gets picked up and resumes where it left off.
</p><p>
Hopefully, seeing some of the less-common constructs has inspired you
to go and check out what other techniques you might be missing from your
repertoire. Most parallel frameworks allow you to do most techniques. But
each one, for historical reasons, has tended to be used for only one
subset of techniques, even though there are constructs available that
hardly ever are used. For shared memory programming, the constructs I
cover here allow you to do many of the things you can do with
POSIX threads without the programming overhead. You just have to trade
some of the flexibility you get with POSIX threads.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Hire a Cerberus to Find Your Phone</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #232, August 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In a recent career shift, I went from an employer who provided me
an iPhone to one who provides me with an Android (Galaxy S4 to be
specific). Although I was happy to move to a Linux-based handset, I was
concerned about replacing the &ldquo;Find My iPhone&rdquo; capability that Apple
provides. Not only does my family use it to keep track of each other,
but we also relied on it when a phone was misplaced. Does the Google
Play store offer anything comparable? Um, yes.
</p><p>
Cerberus is a $4 application (with a generous trial period so you can check it
out) that blows Apple's &ldquo;Find My iPhone&rdquo; out of the water. Not only can
it track down a phone, but it also keeps a history of where the phone has been
(Figure 1), takes photos and videos, and yes, sets off an alarm to
find your misplaced phone.

Figure 1. Cerberus Keeps a History of Where the Phone Has Been
</p></div></div><p>
I was worried Cerberus might cause unusually high battery usage due
to its regular GPS pings, but I haven't noticed any difference at
all. Plus, with all its features (Figure 2), I'd be willing to
sacrifice a little battery life. Thankfully, I get the best of both
worlds!

If you are switching from an iPhone to an Android device, or if you've

I urge you to try Cerberus (<a href="http://www.cerberusapp.com" target="_self">www.cerberusapp.com</a>). It's awesome!

My family is in the middle of moving from one house to another. Part
of that move involves arranging furniture. I'll be honest, I can 
move a couch across a room only so many times before I start to think perhaps
there's a better way. Thankfully, there is.
</p><p>
Although several 3-D house-modeling packages exist, and a couple
are even on-line, nothing seems to work quite as simply as Sweet Home
3D. It's both a 3-D and 2-D layout tool, and it comes with a wide variety
of pre-made furniture and window/door graphics to get you started. I was
able to design a rudimentary living room in about two minutes (Figure
1), and that included installation time! Sweet Home 3D is an open-source
Java application that comes with a nice Windows executable installer.

</p></div></div><p>
You might be thinking, if it's Java, won't it run on other platforms
too? Well, yes, of course! It might not be as simple as the Windows
executable installer to use it on OS X or Linux, but it's Java, so it's
cross-platform-compatible. If you need to design a layout for your house,
but don't want to haul furniture around to see what it looks like,
I highly recommend Sweet Home 3D (<a href="http://www.sweethome3d.com" target="_self">www.sweethome3d.com</a>).

Several years back, Songbird was going to be the newest, coolest,
most-awesome music player ever to grace the Linux desktop. Then
things happened, as they often do, and Linux support for Songbird was
discontinued. I've been searching for a favorite music player for years,
and although plenty of really nice software packages exist,
I generally fall back to XMMS for playing music&mdash;until now.

</p><p>
Nightingale is truly everything I want in a music player. It is simple,
yet powerful. The default install makes listening to music an educational
experience. In Figure 1 you can see that as my Jonathan Coulton song
plays, I automatically see the lyrics, plus instant information on the
artist. If that sort of information doesn't interest you, no problem,
Nightingale is highly customizable with plugins, and there are dozens
and dozens available from its Web site (Figure 2 shows a handful of
plugins recommended during the installation process).

Every music-playing software package I've tried has disappointed me in one
way or another. In my brief relationship with Nightingale, I haven't found
a single thing to dislike. The latest version even provides integration
into Ubuntu's Unity interface, if that's the desktop environment
you prefer. Due to its simple interface, extendible underpinnings,
and its continued devotion to the Linux desktop, Nightingale earns
this month's Editors' Choice award. Get it for your computer today:

<h2 class="title">Window Maker, the Unity for Old Guys?</h2>

As I was diving back into Window Maker for this article, it occurred to
me that the desktop manager I used for years with Debian is disturbingly
similar to the Unity Desktop. It's been clear since its inception that
I am not a fan of Ubuntu's new Unity interface, yet it's odd
that for years I loved Window Maker, which seems fairly similar, at
least visually.
</p><p>
After a little bit of usage, however, I quickly remembered why Window Maker
was my desktop of choice for many years. Yes, it has the &ldquo;side
dock&rdquo;
look and feel, but it's far, <span   class="emphasis"><em>far</em></span> more customizable
(Figure 1).
The dockapps can launch applications, certainly, but they also can be
applications (widgets?) themselves, providing interaction and feedback
instead of just eye candy.

Figure 1. Window Maker is very customizable (screenshot from <a href="http://wmlive.sourceforge.net" target="_self">wmlive.sourceforge.net</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
The Window Maker Live CD actually is a great way to install Debian
too. If you've never experienced Window Maker firsthand, I urge you
to download the ISO file from <a href="http://wmlive.sourceforge.net" target="_self">wmlive.sourceforge.net</a>,
and give the live CD
a try. If you like it, it's certainly easy to install the full Debian
system directly from the CD (Figure 2). Window Maker is a low-resource,
awesome desktop environment that's worth checking out, at least
for a weekend project.
