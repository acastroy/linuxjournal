Are you ready for R?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0b580.0x1003250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article is about the R advanced statistical package. Despite its simple
name, R is a wonderful piece of statistical software with many complex
capabilities and an interpreted computer language&mdash;it's also free. Don't be
afraid of R if you don't feel very comfortable with mathematics or statistics. 
This article presents some easy-to-understand and practical
scenarios that illustrate the use of R.
</p><p>
R is a GNU project based on S, which is a statistics-specific language and
environment developed at the famous AT&amp;T Bell Labs. You can think of R as the
free version of S. The R system distribution supports a large number of
statistical procedures, including linear and generalized linear models, nonlinear
regression models, time series analysis, classical parametric and nonparametric
tests, clustering and smoothing. At the time of this writing, the current version of R is 3.0.1, which was 
released May 16, 2013.
</p><p>
You can use GUIs for R, and the most popular GUI, which also is my favorite, is
called RStudio.
However, I use only the command-line version of R for this article to keep things
as general as possible. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0b580.0x1003510"></a>
Running R</h2></div></div><p>
Your Linux/UNIX distribution probably includes a ready-to-install R package, so go
ahead and install it. Alternatively, you can go to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org" target="_self">cran.r-project.org</a> and
download a precompiled binary or get the source code and compile it yourself.
After installing it, typing <tt  >R</tt> on your terminal will take you to the R shell. Once
the R shell starts, you can start typing R commands. The initial R output on
your screen should look similar to the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ R

R version 3.0.1 (2013-05-16) -- "Good Sport"
Copyright (C) 2013 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin12.3.0 (64-bit)

R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.

  Natural language support but running in an English locale

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

&gt; q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n
mtsouk$
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the first things you will want to learn is how to quit R. Typing
<tt  >q()</tt> quits
the R shell and takes you back to the UNIX shell.
</p><p>
R keeps a history of all typed commands in a hidden file called .Rhistory.
The .Rhistory file is stored inside the directory where you ran the R binary, so if you
are running R from multiple directories, you will have multiple .Rhistory files
on your computer.
</p><p>
The contents of a simple .Rhistory file look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cat .Rhistory
install.packages("RCurl")
install.packages("RJSON")
install.packages("rjson")
install.packages("rgoogleanalytics")
install.packages("google")
source("./RGoogleAnalytics.R")
source("db.R")
summary(wwwdatacomma)
q &lt;- sqldf("SELECT count(*) FROM WWW", dbname = "WWW.sqlite")
q()

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the .Rhistory file also includes erroneous commands that were typed but
not executed, so don't trust everything you see in it.
</p><p>
In order to avoid retyping the same R code, you can create R scripts, which is a
very handy R feature. A good practice is first to try the commands one by one
inside the R shell and then convert them into a script to save time. As
always, don't forget to include comments in your code.
</p><p>
The <tt  >source()</tt> command is used for calling an existing R script when you are inside
the R shell. If you want to find help for the
<tt  >source()</tt> command (or any other
existing command), simply type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ?source()
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to search for help, but you don't know the exact command, try the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; help.search("keywords to find")
</pre>
</p><p>
R supports the use of the Tab key, as in the bash shell, so type the first letters
of a command, press the Tab key, and R will help you find the rest of the command
you are trying to type.

Installing an R Package</h2></div></div><p>
R has a large repository of existing packages, so you don't have to program
everything from the beginning. There are two ways to install an R package:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Install a package that can be found on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive
Network) using the <tt  >install.packages()</tt> function.
</p></li><li><p>
Download it to your computer and install it from the local file using
the same <tt  >install.packages()</tt> command but with different
parameters.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The next section of this article shows examples of both installation methods.
</p><p>
The <tt  >library()</tt> function, without any arguments, prints a list of all the installed
packages. To get more-detailed output of all the installed R packages, you 
also can use the <tt  >installed.packages()</tt> command. The
<tt  >update.packages()</tt> command will 
update the installed CRAN packages to their latest versions. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0b580.0x1004220"></a>
Communicating with Google Analytics</h2></div></div><p>
R can communicate with Google Analytics natively using an R package, so you
can retrieve and perform statistical analysis of the Google Analytics
data. The
first step is to download the relevant R package from
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/r-google-analytics" target="_self">https://code.google.com/p/r-google-analytics</a>, because CRAN does not contain the
RGoogleAnalytics package. Make sure you don't download the ZIP file, because
it is the Windows version of the R package. The UNIX version is a .tar.gz file
called RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz (at the time of this writing).
</p><p>
Then, you need to install it manually using the following command, provided
that the RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz file is in your current working directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; install.packages("./RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz", 
 &#8618;repos=NULL, type="source")
</pre>
</p><p>
The first time I tried to install it, I got the following error messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; install.packages("./RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz", 
 &#8618;repos=NULL, type="source")
Warning in install.packages("./RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz", 
 &#8618;repos = NULL,  :

 &#8618;repos = NULL,  :

&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
This error messages tells me I need to have the rjson and RCurl packages
installed in advance. Both of them can be found on CRAN, and the following shows their installation
process:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; install.packages('rjson')

&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you can install the desired r-google-analytics R package without any
problems:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; install.packages("./RGoogleAnalytics_1.3.tar.gz", 
 &#8618;repos=NULL, type="source")

</pre>
</p><p>
The contents of the RGoogleAnalytics directory are the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
-rw-r--r--  1 mtsouk  staff   902 Jun  6 23:01 DESCRIPTION
-rw-r--r--  1 mtsouk  staff  2071 Jun  6 23:01 INDEX

drwxr-xr-x  4 mtsouk  staff   136 Jun  6 23:01 html
</pre>
</p><p>
To make sure that the RGoogleAnalytics package is installed properly, run the
following command inside the R shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; library("RGoogleAnalytics")
Loading required package: rjson
Loading required package: RCurl
Loading required package: bitops
</pre>
</p><p>
If your output is similar to the above, everything is fine, and you are
ready to continue with the rest of the article. As you also can see in
this output, if you try to load the RGoogleAnalytics package, it 
automatically will load the rjson, RCurl and bitops packages, so you don't need to
load them manually inside your R scripts.
</p><p>
The RGoogleAnalytics package consists of the following two classes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
R Google Analytics: this is the main R package class.
</p></li><li><p>
Query Builder: this class simplifies the creation of queries.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following is an R script (saved as a file called GA.R) that uses the Google
Analytics R package (the line numbers were added to refer to the R
code&mdash;those need not to be typed):


<pre     class="programlisting">
 1  require("RGoogleAnalytics")
 2  query &lt;- QueryBuilder()
 3  access_token &lt;- query$authorize()
 4  ga &lt;- RGoogleAnalytics()
 5  ga.profiles &lt;- ga$GetProfileData(access_token)
 6  # ga.profiles
 7  query$Init(start.date = "2013-03-01",
 8             end.date = "2013-04-01",
 9             dimensions = "ga:date,ga:pagePath",
10             metrics = "ga:visits,ga:pageviews,ga:timeOnPage",
11             sort = "ga:visits",
12             #filters="",
13             #segment="",
14             max.results = 99,
15             table.id = paste("ga:",ga.profiles$id[1],
               &#8618;sep="",collapse=","),
16             access_token=access_token)
17  ga.data &lt;- ga$GetReportData(query)
18  # head(ga.data)
</pre>
</p><p>
Let me explain the R script line by line:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1: the first command loads the RGoogleAnalytics library and its dependencies.
</p></li><li><p>
2: defines a QueryBuilder variable that will be used when defining the
query.
</p></li><li><p>
3: this command gets the required access token that will be generated by Google
(Figure 1). You need to log in to Google Analytics using your
favorite Web browser. As you also can see in Figure 1, for security reasons, the
provided access token expires if you do not refresh it.
</p></li><li><p>
4: creates a new Google Analytics API object.
</p></li><li><p>
5: gets the available profiles that are connected to the Google
Analytics account.
</p></li><li><p>
6: prints the available profiles. This is an optional step and is
commented out.
</p></li><li><p>
7&ndash;16: defines the Query that will be used. There are many parameters;
go to <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides" target="_self">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides</a> to learn more
about them.
</p></li><li><p>
17: files a request to get the data from the API.
</p></li><li><p>
18: allows you to look at the returned data. This is an optional step
and is commented out (I think it's better to execute it manually).
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11520f1.large.jpg"><img src="11520f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Input for the <tt >query$authorize()</tt> Command
</p></div></div><p>
In order to run the GA.R script, you can use the <tt  >source()</tt> R command as follows
(provided that GA.R is in your current working directory):

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; source ("./GA.R")
Loading required package: RGoogleAnalytics
Loading required package: rjson
Loading required package: RCurl
Loading required package: bitops
</pre>
</p><p>
The GA data extraction process requires an access token. To accept the access token
from the Oauth 2.0 Playground, you need to follow certain steps in your browser. This
access token will be valid only for one hour.
</p><p>
Here are the steps:
</p><p>
1) Authorize your Google Analytics account by providing your e-mail and password.
</p><p>
2) On the left side of the screen, click the button &ldquo;Exchange authorization code
for tokens&rdquo; to generate the access token.
</p><p>
3) Copy the generated access token and paste it here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
:=&gt;ya29.AHES6ZRvf0GqfI4yv2LvZXGIF2eGyz34nymGpRkll_4FOi9SFPsv1w
[1] "Your query matched 99 results that are stored to 
 &#8618;dataframe ga.data"
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The ga.profiles variable holds the following values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ga.profiles
        id                              name

</pre>
</p><p>
The returned values are all the supported Google Analytics profiles that I have
in my Google Analytics account.
</p><p>
The important thing to remember here is that you can access your Google Analytics
data natively from R. What you can do with the data is up to your imagination.

Using R for System Administration Purposes</h2></div></div><p>
This section describes how to extract useful
information from a log file of an Apache Web server and analyze it using R. The
name of the log file is www6.ex000704.log and is hard-coded inside the shell
script. You should change its name it to match yours.
</p><p>
A (small) shell script (called www.sh) is used to extract the preferred
information from the Apache log file. Here's the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
echo "Time" "ServerBytes" "ClientBytes" "StatusCode"
grep -v '^#' www6.ex000704.log | awk '{print $2, $10, $11, $9}' 
 &#8618;| sed 's/:/ /g' |
awk '{print $1 ":" $2, $4, $5, "_"$6}'
</pre>
</p><p>
The data is saved in a file called www.data using the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./www.sh &gt; www.data
</pre>
</p><p>
Here are the first ten lines of the www.data file so you can understand its
format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Time ServerBytes ClientBytes StatusCode
00:00 141 433 _304
00:00 142 437 _304
00:00 0 426 _200
00:00 142 435 _304
00:00 142 431 _304
00:00 114096 465 _200
00:00 141 436 _304
00:00 0 295 _200
00:00 141 434 _304
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the underscore in front of the status code was added by the
www.sh script so that the StatusCode will not be considered a numeric value by R.
The <tt  >read.table()</tt> command is used to read the www.data file and import the data.
Then the <tt  >summary()</tt> command is used to get a general overview of the WWWDATA data
set:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; WWWDATA &lt;- read.table("./www.data", header=TRUE )
&gt; summary(WWWDATA)
      Time          ServerBytes        ClientBytes       StatusCode

&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The following statistical definitions will help you better understand the output
of the <tt  >summary()</tt> command:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Min.: the minimum value of the whole data set.
</p></li><li><p>
Median: an element that divides the data set into two subsets (left and
right subsets) with the same number of elements. If the data set has an odd
number of elements, the Median is part of the data set. On the other hand,
if the data set has an even number of elements, the Median is the mean value
of the two center elements of the data set.
</p></li><li><p>
1st Qu.: the 1st Quartile (q1) is a value that does not necessarily belong to
the data set, with the property that, at most, 25% of the data set values are
smaller than q1, and, at most, 75% of the data set values are bigger than q1.
Or more simply, you can consider it as the Median value of the left-half subset
of the sorted data set.
If the number of elements of the data set is such that q1 does not
belong to the data set, it is produced by interpolating the two values at the
left (v) and the right (w) of its position to the sorted data set as:
q1 = 0.75 * v + 0.25 * w.
</p></li><li><p>
Mean: the mean value of the data set (the sum of all values divided by
the number of the items in the data set).
</p></li><li><p>
3rd Qu.: the 3rd Quartile (q3) is a value not necessarily belonging to the
data set, with the property that, at most, 75% of the data set values are smaller
than q3, and, at most, 25% of the data set values are larger than q3. Put simply,
you can consider the 3rd Quartile as the Median of the right-half subset of the
sorted data set.
If the number of elements of the data set is such that q3 does not
belong to the data set, it is produced by interpolation of the two values at the
left (v) and the right (w) of its position to the sorted data set as:
q3 = 0.25 * v + 0.75 * w.
</p></li><li><p>
Max.: the maximum value found in the data set.
Note that many practices exist for finding Quartiles. If you try
another statistical package, you may get slightly different results.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The <tt  >summary()</tt> command provides very useful information
about the data set. Above, you
can see that the busiest minute was 10:46 when 3145 requests were served. You 
also can see that there were 4641 &ldquo;Not found&rdquo; error messages (denoted by the 404
StatusCode number) out of a total of about 1.1 million page requests.

The <tt  >pairs()</tt> command produces an impressive matrix of
scatterplots&mdash;a
scatterplot is a diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates to display values for
two variables for a set of data. It helps you get a quick visual overview of your
data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; pairs(WWWDATA)
</pre>
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows the output of the <tt  >pairs()</tt> command, which is impressive! As
WWWDATA is a large data set, I had to wait a couple minutes for the
<tt  >pairs(WWWDATA)</tt> command to finish and produce its scatterplots.

Communicating with Databases</h2></div></div><p>
R also can communicate natively with many
database management systems. For
simplicity's sake, the database I use here is SQLite3; other
popular supported options include MySQL, H2 and PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
SQLite is a public domain software library that implements a self-contained,
serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the
most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. Its main advantage is that
it does not need a server process to run. Its main disadvantage is that, for the
same reason, it cannot operate with multiple users.
</p><p>
Let's create an SQLite3 database (a single file) using R
commands, and then import the WWWDATA data set inside an SQLite3 table.
Commas are used to separate the different column values, so the WWW.sh file needs to 
to change a little.
</p><p>
R can communicate with an SQLite3 database in two ways:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Using the RSQLite CRAN package, which you can install using the
<tt  >install.packages("RSQLite")</tt> R command.
</p></li><li><p>
Using the sqldf CRAN package (sqldf makes use of RSQLite, so
installing sqldf also installs RSQLite). You can install it using the
<tt  >install.packages("sqldf")</tt> R command.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Both packages need the DBI R package, which, as you easily can understand, will be
installed automatically before installing either of them.
This example uses the sqldf package. Loading the sqldf package with
the <tt  >library()</tt> command produces the following output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; library(sqldf)
Loading required package: DBI
Loading required package: gsubfn
Loading required package: proto
Loading required namespace: tcltk
Loading required package: chron
Loading required package: RSQLite
Loading required package: RSQLite.extfuns
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The slightly changed www.sh script, called wwwcomma.sh, is the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

echo "Time," "ServerBytes," "ClientBytes," "StatusCode"
grep -v '^#' www6.ex000704.log | awk '{print $2, $10, $11, $9}' 
 &#8618;| sed 's/:/ /g' |
awk '{print $1 ":" $2",", $4",", $5",", $6}'
</pre>
</p><p>
The data is saved in a file called wwwcomma.data using the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./wwwcomma.sh &gt; wwwcomma.data
</pre>
</p><p>
The R script (named db.R) that does the job is the following (the line numbers
are added for clarity and need not be typed):


<pre     class="programlisting">
1. library(sqldf)
2. db &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname="WWW.sqlite")
3. wwwdatacomma &lt;- read.csv("wwwcomma.data")
4. dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "WWW", value = wwwdatacomma, 
 &#8618;RAW.NAMES=FALSE, APPEND=TRUE)
5. dbDisconnect(db)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's look at the R script line by line:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1: loads the required library.
</p></li><li><p>
2: creates a new database file called WWW.sqlite.
</p></li><li><p>
3: after creating the database file, it reads the wwwcommma.data CSV file into R
and saves it into the wwwdatacomma variable.
</p></li><li><p>
4: imports the data frames into the database in a table called WWW.
</p></li><li><p>
5: closes the db connection.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Additional handy commands include <tt  >dbListTables(db)</tt>, which lists all the tables in a
database using the db database connection; <tt  >dbListFields(db,
"WWW")</tt>, which lists all
the fields of the WWW table using the db connection; and
<tt  >dbReadTable(db, "WWW")</tt>,
which is like executing <tt  >Select * from WWW</tt> using the db
database connection. If
your table is too populated, expect to see many lines of output.
</p><p>
You also can run SQL commands, such as the following, without opening a database
connection by directly accessing the SQLite database file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; q &lt;- sqldf("SELECT count(*) FROM WWW", dbname = "WWW.sqlite")
Loading required package: tcltk
&gt; q
  count(*)
1  1162795
</pre>
</p><p>
So, the important thing to remember here is that you now can use all the
available SQLite3 commands natively from within the R package!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Even if you are leery of mathematics and statistics, it's a good idea to become
familiar with R. R can provide 
a different perspective of your data that can be pretty as well as
informative.
</p><p>
This article is just the beginning of data analysis using R.
R has many more uses and features than I could show in a single article, and you
should start experimenting with it.
