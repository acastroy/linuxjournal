<tt  >gawk</tt> 4.1 lets you use <span   class="emphasis"><em>really big</em></span> numbers, and finally talk to your OS.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x222e460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In an earlier article (&ldquo;GNU Awk 4.0: Teaching an Old Bird Some New
Tricks&rdquo;,
published in the September 2011 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>; see Resources), I
gave a brief history of <tt  >awk</tt> and
<tt  >gawk</tt> and provided a high-level overview
of the many new features in <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.0. I recommend reading that article first,
although you can read this one without doing so, if you wish.
</p><p>
<tt  >gawk</tt> 4.0 itself was released in June 2011. Since then,
the <tt  >gawk</tt>
development team has not been resting on its laurels! <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.1, released
in May 2013, contains a number of new features, and that's what I
cover here.
</p><p>
Unlike <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.0, there are considerably fewer changes at the language
level (although there are some). The changes this time around are more
concerned with internals, and with the ability to interface to the
outside world. So let's get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x222e9e0"></a>
Reduced Footprint</h2></div></div><p>
For many years, when you built <tt  >gawk</tt>, you got two executables: the regular
interpreter, <tt  >gawk</tt>, and <tt  >pgawk</tt>, its
profiling twin brother, which ran <tt  >awk</tt>
programs (more slowly) and produced a statement count execution profile
showing how many times each line of code was executed.
</p><p>
With <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.0, you got an additional executable,
<tt  >dgawk</tt>,
the <tt  >gawk</tt> debugger.
Although the three versions shared most of the same code, the core parts that
actually executed your <tt  >awk</tt> program were compiled differently in each one.
</p><p>
For <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.1, all three executables have been merged into a single
program, named just <tt  >gawk</tt>. Although the combined executable is larger,
it is still smaller than having three separate executables, and
in addition, the documentation is simpler and easier to understand
(and maintain!).
</p><p>
To accommodate this change, the options had to change slightly.
You now use <tt  >-D</tt> to run the debugger,
<tt  >-p</tt> to do profiling and
<tt  >-o</tt> for pretty-printing without profiling.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x222f0c0"></a>
Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic with MPFR and GMP</h2></div></div><p>
An important new feature that is visible for the <tt  >awk</tt> programmer is
arbitrary precision floating-point arithmetic with the GNU MPFR and GMP
libraries.
</p><p>
This is an optional feature: if you have the MPFR and GMP libraries
installed when you configure and build <tt  >gawk</tt>,
<tt  >gawk</tt> automatically
will be able to use them.
</p><p>
Note that I said &ldquo;be able to use them&rdquo;. You still have to
choose to do so either by using the <tt  >-M</tt> option
(or <tt  >--bignum</tt>, if you prefer long options), or by setting the special
variable <tt  >PREC</tt> to the desired floating-point precision.
</p><p>
The precision is the number of bits kept in the floating-point mantissa.
The default is 53, which is the same as that used by hardware double-precision floating point. From the <tt  >gawk</tt> manual:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gawk -M -v PREC=100 'BEGIN { x = 1.0e-400; print x + 0}
&gt; PREC = "double"; print x + 0 }'
1e-400
0
</pre>
</p><p>
You see that regular hardware can't handle an exponent of -400, whereas
MPFR can.
</p><p>
An additional new variable, <tt  >ROUNDMODE</tt>, sets the rounding mode for
calculations and printing arbitrary precision values.
</p><p>
In the past several years, for reasons I don't quite understand,
I've gotten bug reports from people who expect <tt  >gawk</tt>'s arithmetic
to work exactly like &ldquo;real&rdquo; arithmetic done with pencil and paper.
In other words, they want what is known in Computer Science as
decimal arithmetic. I'm not sure why they expect this, but as we all
should know, computers don't quite work that way.
</p><p>
MPFR does not give you decimal arithmetic. However, if you understand what
you're doing and how to use it, you can get results that are likely to
be good enough for your purposes.
</p><p>
The manual has a full chapter that describes the issues involved with
floating-point arithmetic, what it means when you increase the precision,
and how to use the various rounding modes supported by MPFR.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x222f900"></a>
New Arrays Provide Indirect Variable Access</h2></div></div><p>
There are three new arrays:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >SYMTAB</tt>: provides access to <tt  >awk</tt>-level variables.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >FUNCTAB</tt>: lists the names of all user-defined and extension functions.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >PROCINFO["identifiers"]</tt>: lists all known identifiers and what
<tt  >gawk</tt>
knows about their types after it has parsed the program.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of these, <tt  >SYMTAB</tt> is the most interesting, since it provides indirect access
to any variable. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gawk 'BEGIN { a = 5 ; print "a =", a
&gt; SYMTAB["a"] += 37
&gt; print "a is now", a }'
a = 5
a is now 42
</pre>
</p><p>
With the <tt  >isarray()</tt> built-in function, you can
&ldquo;walk&rdquo; the entire symbol
table and print out all variable and array values, if you choose to do so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x22268c8"></a>
Dynamic Extensions</h2></div></div><p>
The most exciting change in <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.1 is its ability to interface to the
outside world. For many years, <tt  >gawk</tt> had an
&ldquo;extension&rdquo; or &ldquo;plug in&rdquo;
mechanism that let a programmer write a new &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; function in C,
and load it into the running <tt  >gawk</tt> interpreter at runtime.
</p><p>
This mechanism required understanding something of the
<tt  >gawk</tt> internals
and making use of <tt  >gawk</tt>'s internal data structures and functions. Although
it was documented minimally, and it worked, it had several drawbacks.
The most notable one was that there was no backward compatibility across
releases.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, a group of developers forked <tt  >gawk</tt> to create
<tt  >xgawk</tt> (XML <tt  >gawk</tt>)
and developed a number of dynamic extensions and new facilities for the
core executable.
</p><p>
For many years, I had been wanting to provide a defined C API for
writing extensions that would not be dependent upon the
<tt  >gawk</tt> internals
and that possibly could provide binary compatibility across releases.
</p><p>
For <tt  >gawk</tt> 4.1, together with the
<tt  >xgawk</tt> developers, we finally made this happen.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Why Do You Need Extensions?</b></span>
</p><p>
Consider this: an <tt  >awk</tt> program cannot even change its working directory with
the <tt  >chdir</tt> system call! <tt  >awk</tt> is thus
a closed language&mdash;one that provides
you with only the facilities that the implementors chose to provide and
no more. That's not much fun. (Well, <tt  >awk</tt> is fun, but it's still limited.)
</p><p>
By contrast, modern scripting languages are all open and extensible;
Perl, Tcl, Python and Ruby all have thousands of available modules that can
be loaded at runtime. It's past time that <tt  >gawk</tt> could
do that too.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
What You Can Do from an Extension</b></span>
</p><p>
It is best to think of extension functions as user-defined functions
written in another language. They cannot do everything a user-defined
function can (such as call an <tt  >awk</tt> function, manipulate the fields, read records
with <tt  >getline</tt> and so on), but what they can do is enough to make
<tt  >gawk</tt> more open,
and let it interface with the underlying operating system and with
other C (or C++) libraries. In particular, you can:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pass scalars by value and arrays by reference.
</p></li><li><p>
Create and modify new global variables and arrays.
</p></li><li><p>
Access the built-in variables (read-only, although you can update
<tt  >PROCINFO</tt>).
</p></li><li><p>
Register a function to be called when <tt  >gawk</tt> exits.
</p></li><li><p>
Print warning and/or fatal error messages.
</p></li><li><p>
Update the built-in variable <tt  >ERRNO</tt> for when something goes
wrong.
</p></li><li><p>
Hook into the I/O redirection mechanisms, providing your own
&ldquo;special&rdquo;
filenames and/or two-way communicators.
</p></li><li><p>
And of course, register new functions that can be called from
<tt  >gawk</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The API provides a number of data types to make it easier to communicate
with <tt  >gawk</tt>. For example, <tt  >gawk</tt> strings can contain embedded NUL characters
(all bits zero), so strings have a pointer and a length.
<tt  >gawk</tt> maintains
reference-counted strings internally, so there are ways to tell
<tt  >gawk</tt>
to reuse a value it already knows about.
</p><p>
In addition, the API lets you &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; <tt  >awk</tt>'s associative arrays into
an array of structs for easy iteration in C code, without having to call
into <tt  >gawk</tt> each time you want to move to the next element in an array.
</p><p>
A full description of the API is beyond the scope of this article;
however, the manual includes a full chapter, with examples, describing
the API and showing how to use it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OS Independence</b></span>
</p><p>
The extension mechanism has been designed to work on multiple operating
systems. At the time of this writing, it works on any *nix system that supports
the POSIX <tt  >dlopen()</tt> API. This includes Mac OS X. The basic mechanism also
works on Microsoft Windows using MinGW. However, support to build
the sample extensions was not included in the 4.1 release since it was
not ready. This support will be included in the first patch release,
whenever that will be, although not all of the sample extensions can work on
Windows.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Sample Extensions</b></span>
</p><p>
The <tt  >gawk</tt> distribution provides a number of small, sample extensions.
Their main purpose is to serve as examples of how to use the API, but
nonetheless they should be usable for real work also. The full list is
documented in the manual. Some of the more interesting ones are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The &ldquo;filefuncs&rdquo; extension, which provides
<tt  >chdir()</tt> and <tt  >stat()</tt> functions,
and also an interface to the fts(3) suite of routines for walking a file
hierarchy.
</p></li><li><p>
The &ldquo;fnmatch&rdquo; extension, which provides an
<tt  >awk</tt> version of the fnmatch(3)
suite.
</p></li><li><p>
The &ldquo;readdir&rdquo; extension, which returns records for the contents of
directories named on the <tt  >gawk</tt> command line or read with
<tt  >getline</tt>.
(Normally, it's a nonfatal error to try to read a directory. With
other <tt  >awks</tt>, it's fatal.)
</p></li><li><p>
The &ldquo;inplace&rdquo; extension, which simulates the GNU <tt  >sed
-i</tt> feature
for in-place editing of command-line data files.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Additional, more specialized extensions illustrate the use of parts
of the API not covered by the extensions just listed.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The gawkextlib Project</b></span>
</p><p>
Now that <tt  >gawk</tt> supports the major
<tt  >xgawk</tt> features, the <tt  >xgawk</tt> developers
have reoriented their project around their specific extensions. It no
longer includes the forked <tt  >gawk</tt> code base. To emphasize this change in
orientation, they renamed their project &ldquo;gawkextlib&rdquo;.
</p><p>
It is their (and my) hope that this project can serve as a central
clearinghouse for new <tt  >gawk</tt> extensions that may be written
by the <tt  >awk</tt>
community over time.
</p><p>
The gawkextlib project currently has four extensions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The XML extension, which adds several new variables and an input
parser, letting <tt  >gawk</tt> parse XML files in a natural fashion. This
extension is built on top of the Expat XML parser.
This is a powerful extension; instead of having to try to
parse XML files with regular expressions manually, the Expat parser does it
for you, including all the icky validation stuff that would be really
hard to do in straight <tt  >awk</tt> code.
</p></li><li><p>
The PostgreSQL extension, which provides functions for talking to
PostgreSQL databases.
</p></li><li><p>
The GD graphics library extension, for use with the GD graphics library
(see Resources).
</p></li><li><p>
The MPFR library extension. This extension gives you access to a number
of MPFR functions that are not accessible from <tt  >gawk</tt>'s built-in MPFR
support.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x253c8b0"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
I feel that <tt  >gawk</tt> as a language has largely reached maturity, and do
not wish to add too many more features. That said, there are a few
items still open for exploration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Additional numeric facilities, such as possible integration with
a decimal arithmetic library.
</p></li><li><p>
A way to map <tt  >gawk</tt> arrays onto external storage, such as DBM arrays or
SQL databases.
</p></li><li><p>
A &ldquo;namespace&rdquo; facility for extension functions and variables, and
possibly regular <tt  >gawk</tt>-level variables and functions as well. This would
be a major design activity.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, describing the above items does not constitute a commitment
to do any of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2136580.0x253cdd8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The new API and extension facility opens new horizons for
<tt  >gawk</tt> and
for <tt  >awk</tt> programmers. I am very excited about it, and I hope to see
<tt  >gawk</tt> used for many new things where it simply was not applicable before.
