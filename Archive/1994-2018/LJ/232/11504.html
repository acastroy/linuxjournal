There has been a recent spike in the development of mobile operating
systems leading to releases of Firefox OS, Ubuntu for Phones and Jolla
Sailfish. Exotic-sounding for sure, but there's one name missing from the
list, a mobile-optimized OS that will begin appearing in mass-produced
handsets in mid-2013. Tizen is its name, and its developers intend it
to power a variety of devices including phones, tablets, vehicles and
televisions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14ba250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Tizen is a fresh new project, but it has roots in several pre-existing
platforms including the distributions Moblin, MeeGo and LiMo. According
to the Tizen Association, &ldquo;The mobile marketplace has undergone
extensive change over the past few years. New platforms have emerged,
new revenue models have been enabled, and innovations continue to emerge
rapidly from all corners of the industry. Tizen is an open-source
solution that provides an innovative platform offering a high level of
flexibility in service selection and deployment.&rdquo;

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11504f1.large.jpg"><img src="11504f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Key Players</h2></div></div><p>
Tizen's roots and rich history bring a number of groups together and
give rise to a management problem. To leverage the competence of the
groups involved, Tizen is managed by the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Linux Foundation:
according to the official documentation, the Tizen project &ldquo;resides&rdquo;
within the Linux Foundation and is governed by a Technical Steering Group.
</p></li><li><p>
The Technical Steering Group:
the Technical Steering Group is the primary decision-making body for
Tizen, with a focus on platform development and delivery, along with
the formation of working groups to support device verticals.
</p></li><li><p>
The Tizen Association: the Tizen Association has been formed to guide the industry role
of Tizen, including gathering of requirements, identification and
facilitation of service models, and overall industry marketing and
education. In the Tizen Association's own words, &ldquo;The Tizen
Association's charter is to actively develop the ecosystem around
Tizen, which includes the market presence, gathering of requirements,
identification and facilitation of service models, and overall industry
marketing and education.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Corporate Supporters:
the two corporations providing the longest-running support for Tizen are
Intel and Samsung. Other manufacturers include NEC, Panasonic, Fujitsu
and Huawei. Several telecommunications operator corporations supporting
Tizen market adoption include Orange, NTT Docomo, SK Telecom, KT, the
Vodafone group, Telefonica and Sprint. Finally, Jaguar Land Rover heads
up the automotive market in adopting Tizen for its IVI infrastructure.
</p></li><li><p>
Huawei Onboard: according to analyst David Kerr, VP of Global Wireless Practice at
Strategy Analytics, &ldquo;The addition of Huawei is a significant step
forward adding one of the fastest-growing handset vendors in the world
and reinforcing the potential for an alternative to Android to develop
in both mature and emerging markets for smart devices. The decision by
Huawei to support Tizen follows hot on the heels of several other
announcements, all of which put pressure primarily on the Android OS
and clearly demonstrate that most major vendors and indeed operators
continue to hedge their bets as uncertainty and concerns over Google's
dominance continue.&rdquo;
Sadly, early adopters of Tizen technology have felt little Huawei
presence or support so far, the company being suspiciously absent
from the recent Tizen developer conference although advertisements
stated Huawei sponsorship. According to one industry insider, the
company had planned a conference appearance but backed out
of the arrangement, leaving one to hope that other relatively passive
players like Fujitsu, Panasonic or NEC are not sitting on the sidelines
for lack of optimism.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14bac48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
The Tizen Steering Group directs Tizen's
technology while the Tizen Association serves its industrial
interests. The Linux Foundation, Intel and Samsung are its
largest sponsors.
</p></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11504f2.large.jpg"><img src="11504f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Dynamics of Intel, Samsung, Google and Motorola</h2></div></div><p>
Intel has enjoyed a partnership with Google's Motorola unit, which would
seemingly put any future strategic focus on Tizen at odds with Samsung's
potential distancing of Android. Additionally, Intel considers Android
and Windows to be complimentary technologies. It follows that Intel's
market view of Tizen will be similar in the sense that even as Tizen
winds up competing with Android for market share, Intel will profit
nicely, supporting both platforms with specialized chips and drivers.
</p><p>
In any case, having Intel on board as a Tizen partner will please
open-source enthusiasts and Linux users alike. Being the number one
commercial contributor to the Linux kernel, &ldquo;Intel gets the bigger
picture of open-source value&rdquo;, says Kaveh Nasri of the Open Source
Technology Center. &ldquo;When you do (open source), the consumer
benefits.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14bb220"></a>
Intel Open Source Technology Center</h2></div></div><p>
Mr Nasri's group at the Open Source Technology Center is busy
developing drivers for the next generation of Intel chips that could
soon be powering a Tizen device coming to market, even as Intel competes
with several other strong mobile semiconductor manufacturers like ARM,
NVIDIA and Qualcomm, he reports. Tizen engineers build development
images for both IA32 and ARM architectures on a regular basis, and
while the scarcely distributed Intel Black Bay handset housed an IA32
Atom processor, the majority of existing Tizen-powered experimental
devices like the Samsung RD-210 and Samsung RD-PQ pack ARM processors.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11504f3.large.jpg"><img src="11504f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Lion's Lair of Mobile Competitors</h2></div></div><p>
When asked about Tizen's chances as far as competing with established trend-setters like Android and iOS, midterm arrivals like Blackberry 10
and Windows Phone, or emerging contenders like Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch
or Sailfish, Mr Nasri says that Intel's commercial interests are OS-agnostic.
&ldquo;We just want to sell our silicon&rdquo;, he indicates of Intel's
chips and supporting drivers. Linux Foundation Operations Manager Brian
Warner provides a different perspective, stating that &ldquo;Linux collectively
does better&rdquo; when more Linux-based platforms compete. &ldquo;There is a real
opportunity here, and we want to see them all succeed.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14bb6f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Tizen was once almost alone in the category
of fledgling mobile operating systems. Now this space is
filled by Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS and others.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14bb900"></a>
Historical Moblin and MeeGo Failures</h2></div></div><p>
Such statements are loaded with a rich history of ups and downs at Intel
and the Linux Foundation along with associated technologies. Intel is
the founder of Moblin and along with the Linux Foundation was a strong
supporting partner of MeeGo, the mobile-optimized predecessors to Tizen.
Many would have preferred these technologies to thrive, but their short-lived experimental nature leads some to question Tizen's viability,
especially after unraveling corporate partnerships accelerated MeeGo's
fall.
</p><p>
Mr Nasri reflects on his 24-year tenure at Intel and remarks, &ldquo;There's
all sorts of alliances and agreements&rdquo; between Intel and its partners.
In the present case, aside from the Linux Foundation, the two key
corporate players supporting Tizen are Intel and Samsung. While Samsung
likely has its own bet-hedging mobile strategy, Samsung executive VP
Jong-Deok Choi gives assurance of full Tizen support in explaining
that &ldquo;Tizen and Android will get along very well.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But a cynical perspective of Tizen's market chances based on Moblin and
Atom chips is hard to apply considering Intel's success in the
processor races with PowerPC and AMD. Savvy mobile computing enthusiasts
may appreciate Intel's long-term contributions to a vibrant open-source
ecosystem and protection of computing freedom by supporting community
projects like Cordova and Connman. When asked about his alleged
opposition to a nearly decided walled-garden deployment approach,
chief architect of the Intel Open Source Technology Center Sunil Saxena
humbly smiles. His expression as speaking history implies a profound
understanding that Tizen's chances of success lie on a solid but open
technology foundation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x14bbbc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Tizen's kernel is Linux and includes a
number of familiar userspace tools and libraries. It
provides users and developers with a number of freedoms,
like application side loading rather than a walled garden.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4020"></a>
Early Benefits of Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
Mr Nasri agrees that Tizen can beat the odds in contrast to Moblin,
MeeGo and even Symbian or Bada. He brings up the important topic of
intrusive legal bureaucracy, such as intellectual property constraints
typical at large corporations. Open source allows us to do an &ldquo;end run
around the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) lawyers&rdquo;, he states.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4180"></a>
The Flora License</h2></div></div><p>
Just one problem exists with the open-source approach taken by Tizen.
Original Tizen source code (as opposed to integrated components) is
licensed under terms of the Flora license, which is not approved by the
Open Source Initiative (OSI). In theory, this failure to obtain OSI's
blessing places Tizen somewhere in between proprietary and open-source
platforms. In practice, this choice could affect a number of interested
parties. Assuming that many would otherwise use Tizen for its added
development and operating freedom, the choice of a Flora license is
unfortunate and may cloud management's ability to judge Tizen's legal
viability in their markets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4288"></a>
Attracting Developers</h2></div></div><p>
An industry insider familiar with intellectual property (IP) law states,
&ldquo;likely at this stage our only real allies are the open dev crowd,
those who like Tizen because it is open and a real Linux.&rdquo; The insider
claims that, &ldquo;Firefox OS dev phones sold out almost instantly&rdquo; for just
this reason.

Bada Overreach</h2></div></div><p>
Nevertheless, cracks may be appearing in Tizen's developer tech armor
due to decisions relating to overreach of a scheduled Bada migration.
An industry insider refuses cooperation in this area, saying instead &ldquo;I
am not going to be the guy who is asked why is Bada used now instead of
EFL?&rdquo;, clearly fearing that Tizen's pristine and future-proof
architecture may be infected with legacy Bada logic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4758"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
The planned Bada migration to Tizen is
a recent policy development and is dynamic in nature. Some
fear a future overreach when integrating Bada logic.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4968"></a>
Market Trend Analysis</h2></div></div><p>
High-ranking corporate policy-makers happily state their optimism
of the approaching Tizen smartphone market entry. Samsung executive
VP Jong-Deok Choi expresses his assurance that, &ldquo;We have very high
expectations&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Tizen is very real.&rdquo; But what strategy is behind
the policy of strong industrial support for Tizen's rollout? To
understand the various corporate strategies involved in shaping
Tizen's future, as well as obtaining a realistic interpretation of
Tizen's environmental market trends, informed opinions by diverse
analysts give added value.
</p><p>
We ask if Samsung could be using Tizen as a hedge against Android's ever-growing
market dominance, leading OEMs and chip-makers to play cat and
mouse in adapting to the fragmented and controlling Android platform.
Analysts do speculate along these lines that since Google acquired
Motorola Mobility, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers would be
seeking alternatives to Google's Android. Android could become the
preferred platform for Motorola, which likely would put competing
manufacturers at a disadvantage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4b78"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Analysts at Gartner, IDC and Strategy
Analytics are keeping a watchful eye on Tizen and its
competitors. Some forecast an increased market share at
Android's expense.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4d88"></a>
Gartner Figures</h2></div></div><p>
Gartner's latest figures put Android's market share at nearly 75% of
world-wide smartphone adoption. &ldquo;With new OSes coming to
market, such as Tizen, Firefox and Jolla, we expect some market share to
be eroded but not enough to question Android's volume leadership&rdquo;,
states Gartner principal research analyst Anshul Gupta. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b4ee8"></a>
IDC Research</h2></div></div><p>
Indeed, as Android adoption has shot sky-high, a number of new mobile
platform contenders have lined up to compete. IDC mobile-phone research
manager Ramon Llamas and IDC worldwide quarterly mobile-phone tracker
senior research analyst Kevin Restivo remark that &ldquo;This is shaping up
to be a pivotal year for the open-source operating system, as multiple
platforms, including Mozilla, SailFish, Tizen and Ubuntu are expected
to introduce or launch their first smartphones in the coming months.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5048"></a>
Strategy Analytics</h2></div></div><p>
Strategy Analytics analyst Scott Bicheno continues, &ldquo;Android will
remain the dominant smartphone OS for the next few years, but its share
will peak in 2013, while the global share of iOS is unlikely to grow
much further so long as Apple maintains its premium-tier-only strategy.
While Microsoft's market share will remain small in 2013, it will emerge
as the clear third-placed platform by 2017, with BlackBerry leading a
chasing pack that will include the nascent smartphone platforms: Tizen,
Firefox OS, Ubuntu and Sailfish.&rdquo; 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b51a8"></a>
Other Opinions</h2></div></div><p>
But while Samsung has profited nicely from its widespread Android
integrations, some analysts have criticized it for failing to innovate.
Using Google's software is leading to a risky dependence on the software
giant's technology even after its strategic acquisition of Motorola's
mobile division, a direct competitor to Samsung. They reason that Tizen
enjoys additional support due to these market developments. &ldquo;Samsung has
grown up and is playing as the big guy, moving away from Android&rdquo;, says
Gartner Mobile Devices Research VP analyst Carolina Milanesi.
</p><p>
Kevin Burden, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, agrees that Samsung
is motivated to distance itself from Android for this reason but also
partly because it wants greater control over the operating system in its
phones. &ldquo;It almost feels like Samsung is trying to set up Tizen as its
next OS instead of Android&rdquo;, he says.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b53b8"></a>
Operator and Service Provider Tactics</h2></div></div><p>
Vice President of Yandex Labs Juggs Ravalia puts forth the theory
that many corporate heavyweights (especially operators) in the Tizen
Association are worried about lock down in Android APIs and want to
free their technology from difficulties circumventing Google-dictated
services like Maps. While standing to benefit strategically from
both added development freedom and a Tizen success, operators like NTT
Docomo have confirmed that Tizen is a very operator-friendly
platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5518"></a>
Orange (France Telecom)</h2></div></div><p>
This bodes well for the multinational operator Orange. According
to Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Dufal, Technical Director of Orange Devices and Vice
Chairperson of the Tizen Association, the launch of Orange's first
Tizen device will occur in select European markets at the end of
summer 2013 with more devices coming at later launch dates. 
</p><p>
But Orange is not just interested in the traditional smartphone markets,
rather &ldquo;I hope Tizen someday will be delivering great stuff for emerging
markets and especially Africa, and Orange is very active there&rdquo;, says
Mr Dufal. 
</p><p>
In fact, although Orange and France Telecom have strong commercial
representation in many African countries due to historical French
trade relations, they share a second commercial interest in meeting
demand for less-expensive smartphone technology served by competing
multinational operators like Telefonica with their Firefox OS handsets.
Should either or both such efforts succeed, then mobile users in emerging
markets win in the end, but what does this mean for Tizen? Mr Dufal
answers, &ldquo;We hope that in the longer term, we can use Tizen to
democratize the access to the Internet and to smartphones in emerging
markets especially in Africa and the Middle East, where not everybody
can afford the fancy smartphones.&rdquo; His words could resonate
with users in expense-reduced hardware markets producing the likes of
OLPCs and Raspberry Pis.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5780"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Orange has announced a forthcoming Tizen
handset offering. Its end of summer rollout will include
popular Orange services leveraging Tizen's superb HTML5 support.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5990"></a>
Yandex and Big Data</h2></div></div><p>
Internet companies like Yandex are turning to Tizen for its help in
solving problems with and improving cutting-edge developments like
navigation, assisted transportation searches and in vehicle
infotainment (IVI.) According to Vice President of Yandex Labs Juggs
Ravalia, Tizen could serve as a platform for a new generation of
services only possible through the innovative combination of big
data and free software APIs like those provided by Tizen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5a98"></a>
Automobile Industry and IVI</h2></div></div><p>
It's no surprise that Yandex is working on transportation-relevant
network services. According to Senior Technical Specialist for
infotainment systems at Jaguar Land Rover Matt Jones, &ldquo;uptake of HTML5
in vehicles is going through the roof&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Linux is running in
over a million vehicles already.&rdquo; Mr Jones goes on to state the utility
and consumer thirst for rich IVI systems, for which Tizen is a perfect
platform match.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5c50"></a>
Available Game Engines</h2></div></div><p>
Everybody knows that smartphone consumers are enchanted by platforms
stocked with eye-catching games. A number of companies providing game
platforms, engines and more than a dozen game technologies have
come forward to meet Tizen's game needs, including big names like Havok,
Unity 3D, Yoyo Games, Marmalade and Gamesalad. Tizen's potential as a
game platform is attracting independent developers of HTML5 technology
as well, with companies like Sencha Touch providing JavaScript
abstraction libraries for accelerated development.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5db0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Tizen managers and developers alike are
working to provide a variety of game engines to early
adopters with hopes of offering games from industry
giants like Unity.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x18b5fc0"></a>
Primary Game Hardware and Market Size</h2></div></div><p>
Speaking on behalf of one of the largest game engines, Unity General
Manager John Goodale emphasizes ubiquity when speaking of a giant mobile
market large enough to accommodate a number of new technologies. The
smartphone market supports an &ldquo;explosive industry that is growing very
rapidly&rdquo;, states Mr Goodale. &ldquo;There's not just room for two or three or
a handful of players&rdquo;, rather &ldquo;the market can extend to as far as
we can effectively execute&rdquo;, he says. Regarding the ubiquitous nature of
mobile technology creeping into our lives over time, Mr Goodale continues,
&ldquo;some things have become so commonplace that we hardly notice them&rdquo;, and
that according to Juniper Research, mobile devices like Tizen
smartphones likely will be the primary hardware for gaming by 2016.

</p></div></div><p>
Referring to Unity's decision to support Tizen (as well as Tizen's
entry in the smartphone market) Mr Goodale summarizes, &ldquo;Jump on in,
the water's warm.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c6da0"></a>
Uninspiring Ubiquity or Technical Distinction</h2></div></div><p>
A number of technical characteristics set Tizen apart from other
systems with similar mobile-oriented goals. Aside from any number of eye-candy features likely to be implemented close to a first device launch
date, Tizen designers will need to strive for unique features to secure
technical distinction that sets Tizen apart from its competition.
Consumers interested in such unique technology include a number of
actors along the technical &ldquo;food chain&rdquo; starting with designers to
programmers and finally end users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c6f00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Tizen may raise a few eyebrows. Aside
from being packed with familiar Linux technology, Tizen
sports some unique features like dynamic boxes and hybrid
application packages.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c7110"></a>
The Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
For Linux users, first and foremost is the familiar layout of Tizen's
internal filesystem. Most configuration can be found in /etc, runtime
variable state in /var, user files in /home/&lt;user&gt;, temporary files
in /tmp and so on. While security abstraction measures exist to mark and
protect certain regions (SMACK), this filesystem familiarity will
surely provide comfort to some.

Dynamic Boxes</h2></div></div><p>
Tizen puts forth the concept of dynamic boxes, small Web applications
embedded inside other applications, to provide users with dynamically
updated content. The rich Tizen API exposed to provide dynamic box logic
supports the dynamic box with an independent life cycle. At runtime,
Tizen's Web runtime has the ability to control the life cycle of dynamic
boxes.

Ownership and Other End-User Freedoms</h2></div></div><p>
Compared with nearly all existing mobile platforms, Tizen offers an
unrivaled degree of end-user freedom. A user can modify or replace any
part of the platform right down to the kernel and low-level security
layers. Rather than blurring the lines of free license by releasing
binary blobs of kernel and libc while publishing only sanitizing header
files, Tizen's GNU/Linux kernel and other sources are complete, on-line
and publicly accessible. Developers can pull a copy of these sources
and build their own Tizen image ready for installation to
hardware. It remains to be seen if operators will implement
tricky bootloaders to lock terminals to custom kernels and certain
Tizen drivers depending on proprietary microcode (like the modem providing
cellular voice communication), but as far as platforms go, Tizen provides
the end user with far-reaching freedoms.

Breadth of Supporting Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
Arguably, from a development perspective, Tizen's unique platform
architecture sets it apart from nearly all competitors with the
exception of Blackberry. Tizen's architects eyed a variety of device
types from the beginning, leading to a flexible architecture that will
accommodate all sorts of tablets, desktops, vehicle terminals (IVI),
television consoles and others once the first wave of smartphone
handsets is rolled out. Furthermore, Tizen's layered architecture
features core components and frameworks providing APIs to high-level
applications of a variety of technologies. This breadth of logic will
appeal to developers of Web, native, hybrid and third-party
technologies alike.

Web Framework Support</h2></div></div><p>
Scoring 492 of 500 points at html5test.com, &ldquo;Tizen support for HTML5
is the best among mobile browsers&rdquo;, says Samsung executive VP Jong-Deok
Choi. Speaking of its Web runtime and Web framework support, &ldquo;Tizen is
the platform most compliant with HTML5 standards&rdquo;, agrees
Mr Dufal. It's also important to note that security features like content security policy
(CSP) are built in to Tizen's Web runtime as well.
</p><p>
Regarding the question of how high Tizen will rise by leveraging Web
technologies, W3C mobile Web initiative activity lead Dominique
Hazael-Massieux replies, &ldquo;Tizen is very well positioned for sure.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c7a00"></a>
Native Framework Support</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11504f7.large.jpg"><img src="11504f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Developers accustomed to POSIX server technology can port their existing
IA32 server software quickly and easily using the tools freely available
in the Tizen SDK (supporting Linux, OS X and Win32 OS types). Packaging
the ported software to RPM files and installing to the device is
straightforward. Other developers of client apps can choose from Web
or native frameworks and deploy from the Tizen Store in the usual way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c7cc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Providing a special native application
framework, Tizen supports POSIX development as well as
full OpenGL ES hardware accelerated graphics development
using the Enlightenment Foundation Library (EFL).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c7ed0"></a>
Integral Hybrid Packaging Support</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11504f8.large.jpg"><img src="11504f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Tizen supports a broad range of technologies in mobile apps (GNU Free
Documentation License 1.3).
</p></div></div><p>
Tizen includes logic to run native (often server) code
alongside Web (often client) code packaged together, providing a
convenient transport for complex applications requiring device-specific
features (for example, an SSL crypto library) as well as a high-level UI
(for example, Web-based for ease of maintenance).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c8190"></a>
Third-Party Hybrid Abstraction Support</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, third-party providers of system abstraction frameworks like
Adobe Phonegap, Apache Cordova and Appcelerator Titanium serve to fill
any technical API gaps and facilitate porting of existing applications
even further.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c8298"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Engineers of portable Tizen applications
have the choice of both Cordova (Phonegap) and Appcelerator
Titanium Studio for JavaScript-based third-party abstraction.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c84a8"></a>
Hope for the Less-Savvy End User</h2></div></div><p>
It remains to be seen how enthusiastic a less tech-savvy user will be
about such distinctive technical features, but such users may indirectly
profit from quick porting of outstanding applications in other mobile OS
distributions. They could benefit additionally from high-powered compiled
applications running on Tizen's native APIs when such an architecture is
relevant. This model appears to match Research in Motion's efforts with
its Blackberry 10 release; however, closer inspection reveals nuances
in handling of Web applications by the respective Web runtimes as well
as obvious differences in graphics widget toolkits and POSIX
implementations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c85b0"></a>
Application Deployment and the Tizen Store</h2></div></div><p>
According to the Tizen Association, &ldquo;As part of the Tizen
Association's focus on ecosystem development, the Tizen Store will
launch later in 2013 with thousands of apps, allowing developers to
monetize their work and creating a robust ecosystem. The outreach to
app developers to build HTML5 apps has begun.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It remains to be seen how favorably developers will take to Tizen's
store or how enthusiastically consumers will use it. Although Director of
Systems Engineering Mark Skarpness emphasizes that &ldquo;The Tizen App Store
is open for business&rdquo;, neither APIs nor client applications have been
revealed. Nevertheless, developers already are free to open accounts and
submit applications for no charge. Even better, sponsors with deep
pockets have announced official Tizen developer contests awarding
impressive prizes. According to the Tizen Association's planned Tizen
App Challenge, &ldquo;With over $4M in cash prizes, there's never been a
better time to create or port that awesome app for Tizen.&rdquo; 
</p><p>
Aside from improvements stemming from upcoming events and contests
to attract application developers, the store is currently under
administration by Samsung, who will likely change legal conditions
and add distribution jurisdictions in the coming weeks.
</p><p>
Other relevant yet unanswered technical questions include how the
store will implement important validation features like static security
analysis, if advanced machine learning will be employed, and just how
human analysts will inspect and clear incoming submissions.
</p><p>
Finally, while Tizen supports application side loading (manual
installation), a number of third-party distribution services go one
step further. Projects like 5Apps, AppUp, NeXva, AppsFuel, HTML5 Ninja and 
BoosterMedia could prove useful in niche application distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c2580.0x17c8920"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The chances for a successful Tizen smartphone entry depend on Tizen's
ability to accommodate today's fast-moving technology trends, vigorous
marketing of unique features to tech-thirsty users otherwise accustomed
to offerings from the Android iOS duopoly in western markets, and finally,
Tizen must fight head to head with upcoming contenders like Firefox OS
and Ubuntu Touch to capture a share of less-expensive smartphone use in
emerging markets.
</p><p>
While technology analysts are far from united in their opinions, some
statements suggest a trend of reduced Android adoption, leaving market
share up for grabs. In contrast to its past Android and Bada
concentration, Samsung, being strongly positioned in the high-end
smartphone handset market, likely will play an important role in
corporate-sponsored Tizen developments.
</p><p>
Aside from corporate power, Tizen must mobilize organic growth, such as
users migrating from Bada, others smitten by its distinctive technology,
developers drawn by its attention to freedom and strong community
support. These factors could tip the scales, taking Tizen past the
threshold of critical mass and lead to further sales growth and
mass adoption.
