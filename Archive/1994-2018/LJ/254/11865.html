StorageCraft ShadowProtect SPX</h2></div></div><p>
The same backup and disaster-recovery technologies that brought
StorageCraft long-term success outside the Linux space are now available to
Linux users everywhere. The recently revealed StorageCraft ShadowProtect
SPX solution allows Linux users to back up, protect, migrate and
recover virtual and physical Linux servers reliably. SPX features, announced
StorageCraft, enable quick and efficient sector-level back up of a complete
Linux system, including the OS, applications, settings, services and data.
In the case of disaster, IT administrators can recover their systems and
regain access to their systems and data within minutes. Supported Linux
flavors include Ubuntu 12.04, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and CentOS 6.

AnyPresence's JustAPIs</h2></div></div><p>
JustAPIs from AnyPresence is designed with a singular focus: to 
solve the API building challenge for the enterprise app developer in an
elegant manner. The
JustAPIs solution, which enables the building and deploying of contemporary
RESTful APIs, is targeted at IT organizations and enterprise developers who
need to define custom API workflows within the corporate firewall,
complementing existing MBaaS, MEAP/MADP or app development frameworks.
JustAPIs gives individuals a quick, easy way to define and deploy APIs with
specific signatures, which either can be standalone services with
JavaScript-based business logic or connect to existing legacy and
SOAP-based Web services in the enterprise. AnyPresence says that JustAPIs
rises above traditional API management solutions that historically focus on
enterprise-wide API governance and often are too expensive and cumbersome
for the app-specific needs on which this &ldquo;revolutionary new
solution&rdquo; focuses.

Ajay Kapur, Perry Cook, Spencer Salazar and Ge Wang's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
for Musicians and Digital Artists</em></span>
(Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
The world of digital music offers endless opportunities for creativity.
Channeling your inner Philip Glass&mdash;and doing so without sacrificing your
Linux-enthusiast principles&mdash;is a snap with the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming for
Musicians and Digital Artists</em></span>. Subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Creating music
with ChucK</em></span>, this book presents a complete
introduction to programming in the ChucK open-source music language.
Readers will learn the basics of digital sound creation and
manipulation while mastering the ChucK language. ChucK provides precise
control over time, audio computation and user interface elements like track
pads and joysticks. While moving example by example through this
easy-to-follow book, readers create meaningful and rewarding digital
compositions and &ldquo;instruments&rdquo; that make sound and music in direct
response to program logic, scores, gestures and other systems connected
via MIDI or the network. Because this book utilizes the vocabulary of
sound, ChucK is easy to learn even for artists with little or no exposure
to computer programming.

2ndQuadrant's Bi-Directional Replication</h2></div></div><p>
Bi-Directional Replication (BDR) is an open-source PostgreSQL replication
solution developed by 2ndQuadrant, an independent sponsor and developer of
PostgreSQL. The upgraded BDR 0.9.0 adds a range of significant new features
and enhancements, such as dynamic SQL-level configuration of connections
between nodes, dynamic configuration (no restarting any nodes during the
node join or removal process), easy node removal, UDR (Uni-Directional
Replication), replication sets to specify sets of tables that each node
should receive changes on and expanded documentation.

Super Talent's mSATA SJ2 SSD</h2></div></div><p>
Industrial and embedded applications where expansion options for storage
are limited is right where Super Talent's new mSATA SJ2 Solid State Drive
(SSD) belongs. Available in capacities from 16GB to 128GB, the mSATA SJ2
SSD with SATA-III interface offers extremely fast speeds of up to 480MB/sec reads and 160MB/sec writes for mobile solutions. A small form
factor and high reliability are other features that Super Talent notes
about the mSATA SJ2. Target applications include aerospace, casino gaming,
embedded systems and the medical industry.

Black Duck Software's Black Duck Hub</h2></div></div><p>
A critical component of security management in today's enterprises
involves identifying and tracking vulnerabilities in open-source code. To
tackle this task, two natural partners&mdash;Black Duck Software and Risk Based
Security&mdash;have joined forces to develop Black Duck Hub, a new solution
that combines powerful open-source discovery with greater vulnerability
intelligence to ensure higher levels of security in open-source software.
Black Duck Hub helps customers identify security-related issues faster,
prioritize remediation activity and implement proactive controls to avoid
the use of vulnerable components. The power of the partnership between
Black Duck and Risk Based Security is evident in the latter partner's
VulnDB, a resource that extends the commonly used National Vulnerability
Database by an additional 35,000 vulnerabilities, resulting in actionable
intelligence for more than 119,000. The result, says Black Duck, is the
ability for customers to take control of software and
application security proactively.

Wolfram Research's SystemModeler</h2></div></div><p>
Reliability analysis is critical to product development, illuminating where
to concentrate engineering efforts, where failure might happen and how
warranties should be priced. These are just a few of the benefits of Wolfram
Research's updated SystemModeler 4.1, an intuitive modeling and simulation
environment for cyber-physical systems. New feature highlights include
full capabilities for importing models, importing from tools based on the FMI
standard, importing of subsystems from other tools, model exchange without
exposing intellectual property, construction of hierarchical models
containing reliability block diagrams and fault trees and greatly improved
speeds in the GUI. A sampling of industries that might benefit from
SystemModeler's reliability analysis tool are aerospace, automotive,
pharmaceuticals, systems biology and electrical engineering.

Symple PC</h2></div></div><p>
The founder of Symple LLC and inspiration behind his firm's new Symple
PC, Jason Spisak, makes at least two fine points. First, there are millions
of off-lease PCs gathering dust that are more than capable of running Linux,
and we have a responsibility (as stewards of our finite planet) to re-use
them and prevent e-waste. Second, thanks to a convergence of technological
advancements, the present is an ideal time to speed the adoption of
open-source into schools, nonprofits, call centers and Web-enabled
businesses. Enter the Symple PC, a re-manufactured Ubuntu Linux Web
workstation priced under $100. &ldquo;This little marvel&rdquo;, as the company
calls it, is &ldquo;lovingly made in the USA from recycled and re-manufactured
materials&rdquo;. The case&mdash;with 50% less mass than conventional
ones&mdash;is
made from recycled ABS plastic, the parts are recycled, and the carton has
no new fiber content, among other planet-friendly pluses. Under the hood,
users currently will find Ubuntu Linux orchestrating resources on at least
2GB of RAM, 2.8GHz of desktop-class processing power and at least a 80GB
SATA hard drive. To encourage the closing of the product loop, a $10
Environmental Credit is offered for any Symple PC that is returned toward
the purchase of a new unit.
