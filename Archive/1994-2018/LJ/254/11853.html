Legal to Open Word Documents?</h4><p>
Is it legal to open (patented) Microsoft Word documents if I have never bought
a Microsoft-related product? Sure, OpenOffice.org will display such a document,
but am I allowed to view it?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Richel Bilderbeek  <br><br>
</p><p>
Good question. I'm not a lawyer (not even close), but it seems the problem would come
with creating a Word document as opposed to reading it. So my follow-up question would
be, is it safe for LibreOffice/OpenOffice to &ldquo;save as&rdquo; a Microsoft Word document? If we
get any answers from lawyers, Richel, I'll try to follow up with an
answer.&mdash;Shawn Powers

.NET?</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Non-Linux FOSS: .NET?&rdquo; in the April 2015 UpFront
section:
it is not open source in the way that most people in the Linux world
understand the term. A lot of this is similar to Sun's behavior regarding the
Java programming language and JVM. Since the community has been burned by
Oracle's attempt to reclassify retroactively what is open and what is not, one
has to parse Microsoft's licensing terms carefully. In particular, if the .NET
patents are transferred to another entity (even a third-party under
Microsoft's control), some of the protections implied under the license become
invalid. I am not a legal expert myself, but given recent developments with
Oracle/Google, I am still wary of .NET. Like you, I think it's encouraging, but
not enough to commit a serious project to the technology until it survives its
first court challenge.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Daniel Waites  <br><br>
</p><p>
Agreed. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt, but it still gives me the
willies. Hopefully my paranoia is unfounded, but I think caution is wise.&mdash;Shawn

Thank You</h4><p>
Hello everyone at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>!
I am simply writing to say &ldquo;Thank You.&rdquo; I appreciate what you do every day. I'm
sure it seems like a thankless job sometimes, but I like to point out when
someone does something right. Lord knows, there are enough people in our lives
that tell us when we do something wrong.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Don Brown  <br><br>
</p><p>
You rock, Don! Thanks for the encouragement; it's greatly appreciated.&mdash;Shawn

Scanning on Linux Distributions</h4><p>
Having recently purchased a multifunction device&mdash;printer, copier,
scanner and fax machine&mdash;I was troubled to find that scanners and connecting
to and using them in Linux is really bothersome, if you can get them to work at
all!
</p><p>
I realize that many Linux users, and readers of the excellent <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, are
mostly using it for development, exploration and trying esoteric software.
That's great, but what about real-world users of the platform? I bought a
Xerox 6505 mfd, and printing, (using Ubuntu) is simple, but scanning just does
not work at all! I installed SANE, following the instructions on the Ubuntu
site, and nothing! Yes, someone will say that Xerox is not on the
&ldquo;supported&rdquo; list, but not being supported is not very helpful. Fortunately,
I have a MacBook laptop, and all works well on MAC OS X. Why can't Linux be
as easy to use?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Alan Lewis  <br><br>
</p><p>
Ugh, I feel your pain. While printing has come a long way, you're right, scanning is
still painful. I don't have a great answer, other than take comfort in the fact that you're not
alone in your frustration (see Alan McConnell's letter below).&mdash;Shawn Powers

Pipes and Xargs</h4><p>
Great magazine (even though there is no longer a dead-tree version).
</p><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Pipes and STDs&rdquo; article in the April 2015 issue,
the <tt  >xargs</tt> example: it was a good example, but if I were
using <tt  >find</tt>, I think I would also use
<tt  >find</tt>'s
<tt  >exec</tt> instead of <tt  >xargs</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name "*.mp3' -exec rm '{}' \;
</pre>

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Richard   <br><br>
</p><p>
Me too! In fact, when I used it as an example, I had to shake my head a little because
like most things in Linux, there's always another way. The
<tt  >-exec</tt> flag is a perfect
example, and it would have been easier. I was just trying to come up with a simple
example that would demonstrate how <tt  >xargs</tt> works. Thank you for mentioning the other
option though. It's a much more efficient way to accomplish the task.&mdash;Shawn
Powers

Canon Support for Scanning</h4><p>
I think it is time that the Linux community rise in its wrath.
After trying a bunch of printers, including a couple HPs and
Brothers, I finally got a Canon, because the Canon people gave
good support to Linux for its printing capability. I had assumed
that they would support Linux in their scanning function as well.
I was wrong. Take a look at the message below. It is a response
to the message I sent to Canon (that message is shown after 
the Canon reply below):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Dear Alan McConnell:
</p><p>
Thank you for contacting Canon product support.
Scanning is not supported using Linux.
</p><p>
Sincerely,
Technical Support Representative
</p></blockquote></div><p>And here is the text of my original message to Canon:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I have an MF4770n, bought two weeks ago. It prints fine. Now
I need to get its scan function to work.
</p><p>
I am running Linux, Debian Wheezy. I have libsane backends
1.0.24. When I run <tt  >sane-find-scanner</tt>, it returns
<tt  >found USB scanner (vendor=0x04a9, product=0x2774) at
libusb:003:004</tt>.
However, <tt  >scanimage -L</tt> returns: <tt  >no scanners were
identified</tt>.
</p><p>
When I run <tt  >man sane-pixma</tt>, I get a list of the models
that work with this backend. Among them is imageCLASS
MF4770n.
</p><p>
I hope you can tell me what further to do, in order to
use this MF4770n as a scanner.
</p><p>
Thank you in advance.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I consider that I have bought this &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; printer under false
pretenses. I don't know what recourse I have&mdash;it is past the deadline
to return it&mdash;except to publicize this problem and hope that other Linux
users can be persuaded to get involved with this issue. Linux is no
longer a toy to be brushed aside!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Alan McConnell  <br><br>
</p><p>
Alan, I have nothing to add other than &ldquo;GRRRRRRRR!&rdquo; I share your frustration, and wish
I had a solution.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Teeny Tiny Tablet?</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;The Teeny Tiny $20 Tablet&rdquo; article in the March 2015
issue: thanks for the article about the Boost LG LS620. I own such a device too,
and I haven't even rooted the phone yet. All I have to do is download
NoRoot Firewall
(<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall&amp;hl=en" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall&amp;hl=en</a>),
and after each reboot, I have to turn Wi-Fi on and off for one or two seconds and
wait for the time-out of the activation. After this, I can turn on Wi-Fi
until I have to reboot. I've disabled all preloaded apps that I don't need,
and I always have Airplane Mode turned on. So, I don't see why you
have tried to remove the cellular radio icon. 
</p><p>
This phone even supports 64GB
Micro SD cards if you just reformat it with the phone or install an exfat
driver (needs a rooted phone). 
</p><p>
Why do you use Google Maps for off-line
routing? I am using OSMAND
(<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&amp;hl=en" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&amp;hl=en</a>). You can
download ten Open Street Map maps for free or buy OSMAND+ if you need more.
There are other apps, but I prefer open-source programs.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dirk Schwartzkopff  <br><br>
</p><p>
The radio icon thing is nothing more than my OCD driving me nuts. I've never had luck
with off-line GPS apps on Android, but I'll give OSMAND a try. Thanks!&mdash;Shawn
Powers

find|xargs</h4><p>
This is regarding Dave Taylor's article on <tt  >find|xargs</tt> in the January 2015 issue:
indeed, it's a combination of two really powerful commands that can do
wonders in tandem.
However, I wish to point out that find has a mini-xargs built in to it. If you
terminate your <tt  >exec</tt> clause with + (instead of ;), it will behave much
like <tt  >xargs</tt>.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mayuresh   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> I have to admit, I didn't
know that handy tip.
Thanks, Mayuresh. Is it even documented?
</p><p>
It's definitely in the category of &ldquo;more fun with Linux&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mayuresh replies:</b></span> Yes Dave. Quoting "man find"
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If the list of arguments is terminated by a plus sign
(+), then the pathnames for which the primary is
evaluated are aggregated into sets, and utility will be
invoked once per set, similar to xargs(1).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Indeed, it is in the &ldquo;more fun with Linux&rdquo; category.
