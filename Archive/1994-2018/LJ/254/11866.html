Don't be afraid of Docker!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I have a drawer in my office full of screws, braces, gaskets, washers
and countless other &ldquo;extra&rdquo; pieces from various things I've built through the
years. It seems that every time I assemble a bookshelf or put together a
toy for my girls, there always are parts left over. If you're the type of
person who reads directions, you might argue that I simply missed some
steps along the way and don't really have extra pieces after all. You
might be right, but I still prefer to learn by doing, even if that's a
messy way to go about it.
</p><p>
In this article, I talk about doing stuff with Docker. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> has covered
the Linux container system before in depth (Dirk Merkel wrote an incredible
article for the March 2014 issue that explained the entire system in fine
detail, and Federico Kereki has a great article this issue as well). I don't
cover all the intricate workings of Docker here; I
just explain how to use it. If you learn along the way, well,
let's call it a bonus&mdash;just like all those bonus parts I have leftover
when I build things!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04618"></a>
What It Actually Does</h2></div></div><p>
If you're already familiar with the concept of Linux containers, Docker
will be a no-brainer. The only thing Docker does is provide a convenient
interface for creating and managing containers. If you're like me,
the concept of containers makes about as much sense as feathers on a
frog. Fear not, once you get it, it makes sense (the containers, not
the flying frogs).
</p><p>
Hardware virtualization is pretty easy to understand. Every VM gets a
virtualized set of hardware, and it behaves just like bare-metal hardware
off a shelf behaves. You install an operating system and so on and so on. With
containers, it's more like <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> for applications. Applications
are all running on the same computer, but they don't realize it, because
their environments are completely separated from each other.
</p><p>
The main advantage of using containers is that they're more
efficient. Because all applications run on the same system, only one OS is
installed, and only one set of hardware (real or virtual) is used. The
isolation of the apps means they can have different dependencies,
even dependencies that conflict with other apps! If you have one Web
application that requires PHP version 4 and one that requires PHP version
5, normally you'd need to set up two separate machines. With containers,
you just package the application and its dependencies together, and
they interact independently from the rest of the apps in other containers!
</p><p>
In fact, containers are so flexible, you can run an application
that depends on CentOS inside a container hosted on Ubuntu. You just
package the required CentOS files in the container with the app, and
it has no idea it's actually running on Ubuntu, because it sees all the
CentOS files it needs inside its container!
</p><p>
If that's all a little too confusing, here's my simplified version.
Traditional hardware virtualization (VMware and so on) virtualizes the
hardware. Containers virtualize only the software environment in which an
application runs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04930"></a>
So Where Does Docker Fit In?</h2></div></div><p>
Everything I just described concerns containers in general. There are
multiple ways to manipulate containers on Linux. Docker is one of those
ways. Arguably it's the best way, but at the very least, it's the most
popular way. If you're a VMware user, think of Linux containers as being
ESXi and Docker being like VSphere. It's a way to create, interact
and manage Linux containers.
</p><p>
Like most things in the Open Source world, the best thing about Docker
is the community of users who use it. Not only does Docker provide a
great user interface for using containers, but the community also has created
hundreds (maybe thousands) of pre-made environments for running specific
applications inside Docker. In this article, I walk through installing one of
those images&mdash;specifically, the first Docker container I ever
installed: Plexmediaserver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04a90"></a>
Docker Jargon</h2></div></div><p>
Although I'm not going to delve into the low-level Docker stuff here,
it's still important to understand the concepts regarding what
Docker actually does. The two main Docker bits I cover in this article are &ldquo;images&rdquo;
and &ldquo;containers&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Images are downloaded from the Internet or built locally. These images
are stored on the Docker server, but are not directly executed. They're
basically a collection of the dependencies, the application and any
other things required to create a running container. It's like a cake
mix. All the ingredients are packaged nicely, waiting for you to mix them
up and bake them. Pre-built images are available from the Docker Hub,
which is a community-driven repository of images anyone can download.
</p><p>
Containers are what you get when you deploy an image. A container is the
actual running application nestled inside its own environment. When you
unpack an image and start a container, it takes all the ingredients in
that &ldquo;cake mix&rdquo; and extracts them into an isolated environment, then
executes the app. Unlike a cake mix, however, it's possible to create
multiple containers from a single image. Once you have an image, it's
a simple one-line command to start up the application in a container of
its own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a04da8"></a>
Installing Docker</h2></div></div><p>
Most Linux distributions (along with Windows and OS X) can run Docker. I
cover the method for installing on Ubuntu 14.04 here, but a quick Google search
will show you how to install Docker anywhere. In order to install the
most recent version of Docker on your system, simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Normally, installing an application using a script is horrible, horrible
advice. In this case, however, the folks at Docker have created a script
that does things properly. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, it will
create the proper repositories and install the correct dependencies using
APT. In fact, the same <tt  >wget</tt> command probably will work on a CentOS or
Red Hat system as well. It just detects your system type and installs repos
using the YUM tools. I've tested it only in Ubuntu 14.04, however, so if
you want to experiment elsewhere, things might behave slightly differently.
</p><p>
Once the installer is finished, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker -v
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a050c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you should see Docker return the current version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a051c8"></a>
A Few More Docker Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
Before downloading an image and starting a container, it's important to know
how Docker containers access data. See, when a container is created,
it's purposefully isolated from the rest of the system. The filesystem
that the app inside the container sees is a virtualized filesystem to which only
it has access. If your application is a standalone app that doesn't
require any external data, that's fine. In this case (and most cases),
however, you need your container to have access to shared folders. It's
certainly possible to create a container with an NFS client and mount
directories internally, but Docker provides a really simple way to share
folders with containers. When you start a container, you specify what
folders you want to have accessible from inside the running container,
and it &ldquo;maps&rdquo; that folder on the fly without any complicated NFS or
Samba configuration required.
</p><p>
Docker also allows for several networking options with containers. By
default, Docker tries to create a bridged network interface intelligently
and start each container with a unique private IP. You can then redirect
ports on your firewall to the appropriate container IP address, or connect
directly to the private IP from within your network. While that allows
for a very robust and complex network infrastructure for Docker, it also
makes things frustratingly complex for people just starting out. In this
example here, you'll use the &ldquo;host&rdquo; feature of Docker, which allows the
container to share an IP with the host system. In production, there 
potentially are security concerns with this method, but especially at first,
it's a great way to use Docker.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a053d8"></a>
Checking Out the Goods</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's possible to create Docker images from scratch and build them
on your local system, the best way to start is by downloading an image
someone else already created. You can browse those images by heading
over to <a href="https://hub.docker.com" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com</a>, or you can search the same repository
directly from the command line. If you think of an app you'd like to run
in Docker, the first thing I suggest is to check the Docker Hub and see
if someone else already has &ldquo;dockerized&rdquo; the app for you. (That's what
you're going to do with Plex.)
</p><p>
It's possible to log in to Docker Hub from the command line using the
<tt  >docker</tt>
program, but you don't have to have an account in order to use existing
images. You need to have an account only if you want to host or upload
images. In order to see if Plex has been dockerized by someone else, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker search plex
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see a huge list of images uploaded by multiple people. It's
very likely that they all work, but I recommend using images that have the
largest number of &ldquo;stars&rdquo; rating them as favorites. Figure 1 shows the
first few lines of my search query. Notice that the timhaak/plex image has
40 stars. Let's use that one.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11866f1.large.jpg"><img src="11866f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. There's actually a huge listing, but the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; floats to the top.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2a05958"></a>
It's So Simple, Shawn Can Do It!</h2></div></div><p>
In order to download the image to your local system, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker pull timhaak/plex
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see the process as it downloads all the files so you can create
your own container from the downloaded image. Remember, downloading
the image doesn't create a container, it just downloads the &ldquo;cake mix&rdquo;
so you can start up your own instance.
</p><p>
Once it downloads all the information it needs, you can type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker images
</pre>
</p><p>
You should get a listing of all the images stored on your local
system, and you should see the timhaak/plex image listed. You'll probably also
see a &ldquo;debian&rdquo; image that has been downloaded automatically as well. The
plex image builds on top of the debian image, so it downloads that 
too. When you start the container, it won't create a separate debian
container, it will pull what it needs (as defined by the plex image)
from the debian image and include it in the running container.
</p><p>
In my case, I need to have the Plex app be able to access my video
files. I also want the log files to be accessible from outside the
container, so I can see what's going on from the outside. I created a
shared folder on my host computer called /mnt/docker/plex, and I have
my videos stored on /mnt/videos. Once those places have been created
(again, not always necessary, but in this particular case, I need to
access the videos!), the last step is creating the container. Here is
the command I use (I'll go over it piece by piece afterward):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker run -d --net="host" \
-v /mnt/docker/plex:config \
-v /mnt/videos:data \
-p 32400:32400 \
timhaak/plex
</pre>
</p><p>
I used the backslashes because it's a really long command, but it can
all be typed on a single line since it's really just a single command.
Here's the breakdown:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >sudo docker run</tt> &mdash;
This tells Docker to create and execute a container.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-d</tt> &mdash;
This is a flag specifying that I want the container to run as a d&aelig;mon in
the background.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--net="host"</tt> &mdash;
This specifies that the container will be sharing the host's IP
address.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-v /mnt/docker/plex:config</tt> &mdash;
This tells Docker to create a folder inside the container located at
/config that is mapped to the host system's /mnt/docker/plex folder.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-v /mnt/videos:data</tt> &mdash;
Another shared folder, this maps the /data folder inside the container
to the /mnt/videos folder on the host system.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-p 32400:32400</tt> &mdash;
Here the single port 32400 from inside the container is mapped to the host
system's 32400 port. That makes Plex accessible from other computers.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >timhaak/plex</tt> &mdash;
This specifies the image to use when creating the container.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfe7b0"></a>
Test It!</h2></div></div><p>
As long as you don't get any errors, you should be returned to
the command-line prompt. Head over to a Web browser and visit
http://host-ip:32400/web/, and see if you can connect to the Plex
server! (Note: host-ip in that URL is the IP address of your host system.) Figure 2
shows my Plex server running from a container.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11866f2.large.jpg"><img src="11866f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Don't judge me on the shows my family watches!
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, my screenshot shows my Plex server after it has been
configured. The first time you visit the server, you'll need to
configure it for your own system. Still, it should be that easy to get
the container running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfeac8"></a>
Managing Containers</h2></div></div><p>
Much like running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker images
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfec28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
shows you the images on your system, you can see the containers on your
system by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker ps -a
</pre>
</p><p>
If you leave off the <tt  >-a</tt>, it will show you only running containers on
your system. Once you see the containers that are running, you can start,
stop, restart or destroy (delete) them using the <tt  >docker</tt> command. So
running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo docker restart CONTAINER_ID
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dfeee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will restart the container specified by the ID. You also can specify the
container you want to manipulate by referring to its funny name listed
in the &ldquo;NAMES&rdquo; column of the <tt  >ps -a</tt> results. For instance, mine is called
&ldquo;sad_babbage&rdquo;, but yours will be some other two-word name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x290c580.0x2dff0f8"></a>
Where to Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>
There are tons more things you can do with Docker. You can create custom
images. You can build your own images from scratch. You can automate the
creation and destruction of containers on the fly. In this article, you probably learned
just enough to understand what Docker is and how to use it. Hopefully
you're inspired to learn more.
</p><p>
If you prefer not to use the command line to deal with images and
containers, there also are a few GUI tools. Docker has an official GUI
called Kitematic that works about like you'd expect a GUI to work. You
can manipulate images and containers by pointing and clicking instead
of typing on the command line.
</p><p>
However you choose to use Docker, the important part is not to be afraid
of the technology. Even if you never plan to use it in production, I
urge you to play with it a bit. Linux containers and Docker specifically
are really efficient ways to utilize your resources. Plus, it's really fun!
