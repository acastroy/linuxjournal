invention of the Unix kernel in 1969 at Bell Labs. The following
Work In Progress was presented at the Usenix Summer 1993 Conference
in Cincinnati, Ohio. A longer paper based on this research has been
proposed for the June 1994 Usenix Conference as a contribution to a
25th year commemorative discussion about the significance of the
Unix breakthrough and lessons to be learned from it for making the
next step forward.
</p><p>The Multics (1965-68) project had been created to &ldquo;show that
general-purpose, multiuser, timesharing systems were viable&rdquo;1.
Based on the results of research gained at MIT using the MIT
Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), AT&amp;T and G.E. agreed to
work with MIT to build a &ldquo;new hardware, a new operating system, a
new file system, and a new user interface&rdquo;. Though the project
proceeded slowly and it took years to develop Multics, Doug Comer,
a Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University, explains that
&ldquo;fundamental issues were uncovered&rdquo; in the process of the research
on Multics, &ldquo;new approaches were explored and new mechanisms were
invented&rdquo;. The most important, he explains, was that &ldquo;participants
and observers alike became devoted to a new form of computing (the
interactive, multiuser, timesharing system.). As a result, the
Multics project dominated computer systems research for many years,
and many of its results are still considered seminal.&rdquo;</p><p>By 1969, however, AT&amp;T made a decision to withdraw from
the project. Describing that period, Dennis Ritchie, one of the
inventors of Unix at Bell Labs writes, &ldquo;By 1969, Bell Labs
management, and even the researchers came to believe that the
promises of Multics could be fulfilled only too late and too
expensively.&rdquo;2</p><p>&ldquo;Even before the GE-645 Multics machine was removed from the
premises,&rdquo; Ritchie explains, &ldquo;an informal group led primarily by
Ken Thompson, had begun investigating alternatives.&rdquo;</p><p>Thompson and Ritchie presented Bell Labs with proposals to
buy them a computer so they could build their own interactive, time
sharing operating system. Their proposals weren't acted on.
Eventually, Ken Thompson found a little-used and obsolete PDP-7
computer, a tiny machine in the class of a Commodore 64
computer.</p><p>The environment Thompson was attempting, explains Ritchie,
included &ldquo;many of the innovative aspects of Multics&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;an
explicit notion of a process as a locus of control, a
tree-structured file system, a command interpreter as a user-level
program, simple representation of text files, and generalized
access to devices&rdquo;3. Describing the primitive conditions that
Thompson faced when attempting to create his desired programming
environment, Ritchie writes:</p><p>At the start, Thompson did not even program on the PDP
itself, but instead used a set of macros for the GEMAP assembler on
a GE-635 machine. A postprocesser generated a paper tape readable
by the PDP-7. These tapes were carried from the GE machine to the
PDP-7 for testing until a primitive Unix kernel, an editor, an
assembler, a simple shell (command interpreter), and a few
utilities (like the Unix rm, cat, cp commands) were completed. At
this point, the operating system was self-supporting; programs
could be written and tested without resort to paper tape, and
development continued on the PDP-7 itself.4</p><p>The result, Ritchie explains, was that,</p><p>Thompson's PDP-7 assembler outdid even DEC's in simplicity;
it evaluated expressions and emitted the corresponding bits. There
were no libraries, no loader or link editor: the entire source of a
program was presented to the assembler, and the output file --with
a fixed name&mdash;that emerged was directly executable.5</p><p>The operating system was named Unix, to distinguish it from
the complexity that burdened Multics.</p><p>As work continued on the Bell Labs operating system, the
researchers developed a set of principles to guide their work.
Among these principles were:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new
job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new
features.</p></li><li><p>Expect the output of every program to become the
input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output
with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary
input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.</p></li><li><p>Design and build software, even operating systems,
to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw
away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.</p></li><li><p>Use tools in preference to unskilled help to
lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the
tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished
using them.6</p></li></ol></div><p>By 1970, Ritchie writes, the Unix researchers were &ldquo;able to
acquire a new DEC PDP-11. The processor&rdquo;, he remembers, &ldquo;was among
the first of its line delivered by DEC, and three months passed
before its disk arrived.&rdquo; Soon after the machine's arrival and
while &ldquo;still waiting for the disk,&rdquo; Ritchie recalls, &ldquo;Thompson
recoded the Unix kernel and some basic commands in PDP assembly
language. Of the 24K bytes of memory on the machine, the earliest
PDP-11 Unix system used 12K bytes for the operating system, a tiny
space for user programs, and the remainder as a RAM disk.&rdquo;8 Ritchie
explains, &ldquo;By early 1973, the essentials of modern C were complete.
The language and compiler were strong enough to permit us to
rewrite the kernel for the PDP-11 in C during the summer of that
year.&rdquo; 9 Each program they built developed some simple capability
and they called that program a tool. They wanted the programs to be
fun to use and to be helpful to programmers. Describing the
achievements of the lab, Doug McIlroy, one of the researchers and
Thompson's Department Head when he created the Unix kernel,
describes the atmosphere at the lab:</p><p>Constant discussions honed the system.... Should tools
usually accept output file names? How to handle demountable media?
How to manipulate addresses in a higher level language? How to
minimize the information deducible from a rejected login? Peer
pressure and simple pride in workmanship caused gobs of code to be
rewritten or discarded as better or more basic ideas emerged.
Professional rivalry and protection of turf were practically
unknown: so many good things were happening that nobody needed to
be proprietary about innovations.10</p><p>The research done at the Labs was concerned with using the
computer to automate programming tasks. By a scientific approach to
their work and careful attention to detail, Bell Labs researchers
determined the essential elements in a design and then created a
program to do as simple a job as possible. These simple computer
automation tools would then be available to build programs to do
more complicated tasks. They created a Unix kernel accompanied by a
toolbox of programs that could be used by others at Bell Labs. The
kernel consisted of about 11,000 lines of code. Eventually, 10,000
lines of the code were rewritten in C and thus could be transported
to other computer systems. &ldquo;The kernel,&rdquo; Ken Thompson writes, &ldquo;is
the only Unix code that cannot be substituted by a user to his own
liking. For this reason, the kernel should make as few real
decisions as possible.&rdquo;11 Thompson describes creating the
kernel:</p><p>What is or is not implemented in the kernel represents both a
great responsibility and a great power. It is a soap-box platform
on `the way things should be done.' Even so, if `the way' is too
radical, no one will follow it. Every important decision was
weighed carefully. Throughout, simplicity has been substituted for
efficiency. Complex algorithms are used only if their complexity
can be localized. (12)</p><p>The kernel was conceived as what was essential and other
features were left to be developed as part of the tools or software
that would be available. Thompson explains:</p><p>The Unix kernel is an I/O multiplexer more than a complete
operating system. This is as it should be. Because of this outlook,
many features found in most other operating systems are missing
from the Unix kernel. For example, the Unix kernel does not support
file access methods, file disposition, file formats, file maximum
sizes, spooling, command language, logical records, physical
records, assignment of logical file names, logical file names, more
than one character set, an operator's console, an operator, log-in,
or log-out. Many of these things are symptoms rather than features.
Many of these things are implemented in user software using the
kernel as a tool. A good example of this is the command language.
Maintenance of such code is as easy as maintaining user code. The
idea of implementing `system' code and general user primitives
comes directly from Multics.13</p><p>During the same period that Bell Labs researchers were doing
their early work on Unix, the Bell System was faced with the
problem of automating their telephone operations using
minicomputers.</p><p>&ldquo;The discovery that we had the need&mdash;or actually, the
opportunity&mdash;in the early `70s to use these minis to support
telephone company operations encouraged us to work with the Unix
system,&rdquo; writes Berkley Tague.14 &ldquo;We knew we could do a better job
with maintenance, traffic control, repair, and accounting
applications. The existing systems were made up of people and
paper,&rdquo; he relates. &ldquo;The phone business was in danger of being
overwhelmed in the early `70s with the boom of the `60s. There was
a big interest then in using computers to help manage that part of
the business. We wanted to get rid of all of those Rolodex files
and help those guys who had to pack instruments and parts back and
forth just to keep things going&rdquo;.</p><p>He goes on to describe the kind of operations that Bell
Systems needed to automate. Just as Operating Systems people in the
Bell system had come to recognize the need for portability in a
computer operating system, Ritchie and Thompson and the other
programming researchers at Bell Labs had created the computer
language C and rewritten the majority of the Unix kernel in C and
thus had made the important breakthrough in creating a computer
operating system that was not machine dependent. Describing their
breakthrough with Unix, Thompson and Ritchie presented their first
paper on Unix at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles at
the Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, IBM
Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York,
October 15-17, 1973.15</p><p>With the research breakthrough of a portable computer
operating system, &ldquo;the first Unix applications&rdquo;, writes Mohr, in an
article in Unix Review, &ldquo;were installed in 1973 on a system
involved in updating directory information and intercepting calls
to numbers that had been changed. The automatic intercept system
was delivered for use on early PDP-11s. This was essentially the
first time Unix was used to support an actual, ongoing operating
business.&rdquo;16</p><p>The labs made the software available to academic institutions
at a very small charge. For example, John Lions, a faculty member
in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New
South Wales, in Australia, reported that his school was able to
acquire a copy of research Unix Edition 5 for $150 ($110
Australian) in December, 1974, including tape and manuals.17</p><p>By 1979, the automation at AT&amp;T had the benefit of
research done not only at Bell Labs, but also by researchers in the
academic community. Early in its development, word of the Unix
operating system and its advantages spread outside of Bell Labs.
(Several sources attribute this to the paper that Ritchie and
Thompson presented on Unix at the Symposium on Operating Principles
in 1973.18)</p><p>Unix was attractive to the academic Computer Science
community for several reasons. After describing the more obvious
advantages like its price, that it could be shaped to the
installation, that it was written in C which was attractive when
compared with assembly language, that it was sufficiently small
that an individual could study and understand it, John Stoneback
writes:</p><p>Unix had another appealing virtue that many may have
recognized only after the fact&mdash;its faithfulness to the prevailing
mid-'70s philosophy of software design and development. Not only
was Unix proof that real software could be built the way many said
it could, but it lent credibility to a science that was struggling
to establish itself as a science. Faculty could use Unix and teach
about it at the same time. In most respects, the system exemplified
good computer science. It provided a clean and powerful user
interface and tools that promoted and encouraged the development of
software. The fact that it was written in C allowed actual code to
be presented and discussed, and made it possible to lift textbook
examples into the real world. Obviously, Unix was destined to grow
in the academic community.19</p><p>In trying to teach his students the essentials of a good
operating system, John Lions of the University of New South Wales
in Australia describes how he prepared a booklet containing the
source files for a version of Edition 6 of research Unix in 1976
and the following year completed a set of explanatory notes to
introduce students to the code. &ldquo;Writing these,&rdquo; he recounts, &ldquo;was
a real learning exercise for me. By slowly and methodically
surveying the whole kernel, I came to understand things that others
had overlooked.&rdquo;20</p><p>This ability to present his students with a real example of
an operating system kernel was a breakthrough. Lions writes:</p><p>Before I wrote my notes on Unix, most people thought of
operating systems as huge and inaccessible. Because I had been at
Burroughs, I knew that people could get to learn a whole program if
they spent some time working at it. I knew it would be possible for
one person to effectively become an expert on the whole system. The
Edition 6 Unix code contained less than 10,000 lines, which
positioned it nicely to become the first really accessible
operating system.21</p><p>In keeping true to the Unix community spirit of helping each
other, Lions wrote a letter to Mel Ferentz, Lou Katz and others
from Usenix and offered to make copies of his notes available to
others. After some negotiation with Western Electric over the
patent licensing, he distributed the notes titled &ldquo;A Commentary on
the Unix Operating System&rdquo; to others with Unix licenses on the
conditions that Western Electric had set out.22</p><p>Describing how research Unix and its adoption at academic
institutions has served to develop computer science, Doug Comer
writes:</p><p>The use of Unix as a basis for operating systems research has
produced three highly desirable consequences. First, the
availability of a common system allowed researchers to reproduce
and verify each other's experiments. Such verification is the
essence of science. Second, having a solid base of systems software
made it possible for experimenters to build on the work of others
and to tackle significant ideas without wasting time developing all
the pieces from scratch. Such a basis is prerequisite to productive
research. Third, the use of a single system as both a research
vehicle and a conventional source of computing allowed researchers
to move results from the laboratory to the production environment
quickly. Such quick transition is mandatory of state-of-the-art
computing.23</p><p>Not only did research Unix serve the academic community, but
the contributions of the academic community were incorporated into
research Unix. An example is the work at UC Berkeley of designing a
virtual memory version of Unix for the VAX computer which was later
optimized and incorporated into a release of Unix. &ldquo;A tide of
ideas,&rdquo; explains Comer, &ldquo;had started a new cycle, flowing from
academia to an industrial laboratory, back to academia, and finally
moving on to a growing number of commercial sites.&rdquo;24</p><p>Summarizing the relationship between Bell Labs and the
academic community in developing Unix, Comer concludes:</p><p>Unix was not invented by hackers who were fooling around, nor
did it take shape in a vacuum. It grew from strong academic roots
and it has both nurtured and taken nourishment from academia
throughout its development. The primary contributors to Unix were
highly educated mathematicians and computer scientists employed by
what many people feel is the world's premier industrial research
center, Bell Laboratories. Although they were knowledgeable and
experienced in their own right, these developers maintained
professional contacts with researchers in academia, leading to an
exchange of ideas that proved beneficial for both sides.
Understanding the symbiotic relationship between Unix and the
academic community means understanding the background of the
system's inventors and the history of interactions between
universities and Bell Laboratories.25</p><p>John Lions, reviewing his experience as part of the Unix
community, concludes, &ldquo;We have made a large number of contacts and
exchanged a great deal of information around the world through this
Unix connection. Possibly that is the nicest thing about Unix: it
is not so much that the system itself is friendly but that the
people who use it are.&rdquo;26</p><p>It is a rare and wonderful event in the development of human
society when a scientific and technological breakthrough is made
which will certainly affect the future course of social development
and which becomes known when its midwives are still alive to tell
us about it. Unix, the product of researcher at Bell Labs, the then
regulated AT&amp;T system, and academic computer science, and a
valuable invention for computer science, for computer education and
for the education of the next generation of computer scientists and
engineers, is such an event.</p><p>Unix and Computer Science&copy; by Ronda Hauben, is adapted
