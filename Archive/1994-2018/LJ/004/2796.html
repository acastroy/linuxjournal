#2 [The &ldquo;What's GNU&rdquo; article on using the Unix &ldquo;tools philosophy&rdquo;]
was interesting to me. The final pipeline on page 17 has given me a
better idea of what Unix really is!!
</p><p>I even got it working, too, in my Slackware 1.1.1 from
morse.net-jon kitchin, VK6TU,
<a href="mailto:jon@dialix.oz.au">jon@dialix.oz.au</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i> replies</b></span>:</p><p>We're glad you liked it. You will probably enjoy the article
this month on the history of Unix. Like the &ldquo;What's GNU&rdquo; article,
it does not directly relate to Linux, but it tells a story that
explains why we can have Linux in the first place.</p><p>Your <i  >Linux Journal</i> is great. I just read the second issue,
which was outstanding, and would like to ftp the GNU C Library
Reference Manual. I could not find it at sunsite. What is the file
name I should be looking for?-Clinton Carr,
<a href="mailto:clint@netcom.com">clint@netcom.com</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i> replies</b></span>:</p><p>All GNU software (that is, software maintained by the Free
Software Foundation) and its documentation, including the GNU C
library and the GNU C library reference manual, can be found at
prep.ai.mit.edu in the directory /pub/gnu, and on mirror sites
around the world. Read gnu.announce, where each post announcing a
new product is followed by a list of mirror sites all over the
world.</p><p>The filename you want is glibc-1.07.tar.gz, which contains
both the source code and the documentation.</p><p>I am looking for some technical details like process
management, memory management, process coordination, file system,
etc. of Linux OS for my term project. If you could direct me to get
those information I would greatly appreciate it.-Raghib Muhammad,
<a href="mailto:raghib@pegasus.montclair.edu">raghib@pegasus.montclair.edu</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i> replies</b></span>:</p><p>First, read the source. It's pretty readable, at least to
me.</p><p>I have written the beginnings of a book about Linux internals
called the Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide. It is not complete, but you
can ftp it from tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/docs/LDP/khg* Also,
read Bach's The Design of the Unix Operating System which is about
AT&amp;T's internals, but they are somewhat similar. Linus read
that book while designing Linux. The KHG contains an annotated
bibliography that might help you, as well.</p><p>I enjoyed reading the April issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and have
two questions on Linux that might be of interest to other readers.
I would certainly appreciate any help or solutions.</p><p>Does Linux currently support or plan to support QIC-80 tape
back-up via a NON-SCSI interface? What I specifically have in mind
is an external tape unit that interfaces with the PC via the
parallel (printer) port.</p><p>I have a date/time system problem with all Linux kernels that
I have compiled beginning with patch level 14 and including the
latest Linux 1.0, when I compile on my home computer, a 386DX with
8 MB and a math coprocessor. When I compile patch levels 12 and 13,
I do not have this problem. When I boot with a floppy containing
the newly compiled kernel, Linux starts up without the correct
date/time. Instead it thinks it is Jan 1, 1970. If I use the same
floppy kernel to boot on my PC at work (a 486DX with 8MB) the
current date/time of the system is found. So it appears to be
something related to compiling and then booting the kernel on my PC
at home. However, this is not a problem with patch levels 13 or 12.
Something in the kernel code changed beginning with patch level 14
that now causes difficulties in finding the system time on my home
computer.-Donald Mugnai, Silver Spring, MD</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i> replies</b></span>:</p><p>As documented in the Ftape-HOWTO, there is currently no
support at all for any tape drives that work off the parallel port.
All of these drives use proprietary protocols. No one that we are
aware of in the Linux community is currently working on reverse
engineering those protocols so as to be able to use those drives.
As far as your system time problem, have you tried booting an old
patchlevel 12 or 13 kernel on your home PC lately? It might simply
be a worn-out battery on your CMOS. If any readers have any better
solutions, please send them in. This question might be a little too
specific, or be in a FAQ. I was running Slackware Linux 0.99pl14
with a SCSI CD-ROM. The CD-ROM was mounted with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t iso9960 /dev/sr0 /cd-rom
</pre><p>I later wanted to access a different CD, so I did:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
umount /cd-rom
</pre><p>Popped in the new disk, mounted it, and the system thinks the
original disk is in the drive. This doesn't happen with floppies,
so there must be a switch to mount that says it's removable media.
Is there a special way to mount a CD-ROM so the fs will recognize
that it's changed?-Joe Wronski,
<a href="mailto:jwronski@mystery.bbn.com">jwronski@mystery.bbn.com</a></p><p>Eric Youngdale,
<a href="mailto:ericy@cais.com">ericy@cais.com</a>,
replied:</p><p>Sounds like broken firmware on the drive. Any removable SCSI
device should report a media change anytime you change discs, and
for some reason this is not happening for you. If the drive were
reporting the change, then all of the old buffers would be
flushed.</p><p>One way to force the issue is to simply attempt to use the
drive while the drive is empty. The scsi code notices that there is
nothing there and does the right thing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Joe replied</b></span>:</p><p>Thanks for looking into this. Actually, I had been running a
version of Linux earlier than 1.0 (.99pl14, I think). After finally
building and installing 1.0, the CD-ROM media changes are detected
and reported at mount time. All's as it should be now.</p><p>Is there a means with Linux to format and use 3.5" disks
above 1.44Mb (1.7MB for instance) as easily as with MS-DOS ?-Xavier
Cazin,
<a href="mailto:p6ip051@cicrp.jussieu.fr">p6ip051@cicrp.jussieu.fr</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i> replies</b></span>:</p><p>Yes. There are a set of patches on tsx-11.mit.edu that
accomplish this. There is something in the directory
/pub/linux/patches/ called fdpatch2for15.* which does what you
want; it supports 3.5" 1.77 MB disks and 5.25" 1.44 MB disks. With
that patch applied to use extra-high-formats, the standard fdformat
should allow you to format any supported format.</p><p>The patches come with a patched version of mtools which will
allow you to access DOS-formatted floppies at these formats. The
Linux DOS filesystem should access them correctly without any
changes, once the fd driver is patched to recognize the
high-capacity formats.</p><p>All letters to the editor and submissions for Linux Q&amp;A

preferred, because we can print the results of a discussion, which
can be more useful than just your letter and our response.</p></div></div>
