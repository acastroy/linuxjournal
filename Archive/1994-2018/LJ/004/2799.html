    This month, Cooking with Linux jogs your memory with a look
    at the history of Linux. Or, at least, that's how we
    remember it...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbf580.0xdb73a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux users these days have it easy. Back
when I was starting out with the system (around the 0.12 days), we
didn't have the luxuries of networking, documentation, DOSEMU, or
XFree86 for that matter. We didn't have &ldquo;Plug and Play&rdquo; Linux
distributions on media ranging from floppy to tape to CD-ROM. There
were two so-called &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; to choose from: H.J. Lu's
classic &ldquo;boot/root&rdquo; diskettes, or the then-popular MCC-Interim
release-which contained nearly all of the Linux software available
at the time on a whopping seven diskettes.
</p><p>Today, Linux development has improved to such a point that
nothing seems to be challenging anymore. Running gcc without a
segmentation fault used to give me thrills; now it's a part of
everyday life. (On occasion,</p><p>I will fire up my ancient 0.95+ kernel and try to compile
Emacs with gcc-1.38, just to bring back the excitement of cursing
at the machine for hours as error messages fill the screen.) Linux
is just too easy. Anybody can download Slackware and run their own
WWW server over a SLIP line. And without having to compile a single
line of code! It's sad, I'm telling you.</p><p>To fully appreciate the power of Linux, I believe that all
newcomers should be forced to relive those days of yore, when the
definition of a &ldquo;real hacker&rdquo; was someone who would stay up all
night in a vain attempt to decipher the semantics of the serial
driver. (Possibly in order to get the serial cheese grater to work,
but that is another story.) Without going through this kind of
painful, teeth-grinding ordeal it is too easy for users to take the
many, many hours of hard work by the Linux developers for
granted.</p><p>So, I think it is appropriate at this time to inflict a
reality check on the current generation of Linux users, in the form
of a short &ldquo;Do You Remember?&rdquo; quiz. Without overdoing the
nostalgia, let us say that if you can remember at least, er, half
of the items in this list then you are qualified to call yourself a
Linux grunt&mdash;who has earned the right to sit back and drink coffee
while your Linux box formats your thesis with TeX, recompiles libc,
and provides anonymous FTP access to the majority of Eastern Europe
all at the same time.</p><p>Be warned: Some of the items in the following list may bring
back painful memories. If you are overly sentimental or have small
children, you may want to consider turning the page&mdash;now.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbf580.0xdb7660"></a>Do you remember...</h2></div></div><p>1. ...comp.os.linux? All right, that's an easy one, but since
the proliferation of the&mdash;what is it now?&mdash;five Linux newsgroups,
some of us may have forgotten how pleasant it was to spend a Friday
evening&mdash;scratch that&mdash;an entire week, catching up on articles in
the single Linux-related Usenet forum. Unless you had a killfile
larger than the collected works of Terry Pratchett you simply had
no hope of following it all. And woe to the faithful reader that
missed &ldquo;important&rdquo; postings, such as announcements of new kernel
releases, or the weekly &ldquo;Linux is Obsolete&rdquo; flamewar.</p><p>Eventually, the Linux community wised up and decided to
create comp.os.linux.announce, and six months later the current
slew of Linux groups. This was at a time when nearly 50% of
postings to c.o.l were calls for a newsgroup split, so it was
inevitable.</p><p>Bonus question: If you remember comp.os.linux, what about
alt.os.linux, its predecessor? Or, what about the first Linux
threads to emerge on comp.os.minix? (If you can remember this, then
you really are a Linux hacker. Either that, or you spend too much
time reading Usenet.)</p><p>2. ...When the major Linux FTP site was banjo.concert.net?
That's right&mdash;long before SunSITE was merely a desk calculator,
there was banjo. Alan Clegg, who ran banjo at the time, was
eventually forced to remove the Linux archives from that machine,
as they required too much diskspace&mdash;an entire 45 megs. To top it
all off, there were dozens of FTP logins a day. It was too much for
the poor machine, so banjo had to call it quits.</p><p>SunSITE's entry into the Linux world was due in part to Jon
Magid (do you remember him?) being hired as the systems
administrator for a new FTP/Gopher/WAIS/WWW site funded by Sun
Microsystems. Sun gave the SunSITE administrators permission to
provide any kind of interesting information that they wished from
the new machine, so Jon copied banjo's entire Linux archives
over.</p><p>Since then, Linux FTP usage on SunSITE has grown to amazing
proportions. The Linux archives there now require more than 640
megabytes of disk storage. On a typical day, there might be 2,500
Linux FTP logins, and around 43,000 Linux files downloaded in all.
If you were to count all of the Linux-related FTP traffic to
SunSITE's many mirrors, as well as the other major Linux archive
sites, I'm sure you'd have enough statistics to give the NSF a real
headache.</p><p>3. ...The Minix filesystem? This filesystem was (and perhaps
still is) a favorite of Linux hackers for quite some time. Never
mind the fact that it was originally the only filesystem type
supported by the kernel, and that it limited partitions to 64
megabytes in size. Linus Torvalds began development of the Linux
kernel under Minix, an academic Unix clone featured in an operating
systems book by Andy Tanenbaum. So it made perfect sense to
implement the Minix filesystem for which Linus had the source code.
There is an interesting anecdote (or shall we say &ldquo;legend?&rdquo;) in
which Linus accidentally trashed one of his Minix filesystems&mdash;the
one which happened to contain the entire Linux kernel source tree
on his system. Linus, being the Minix filesystem wizard that he is,
managed to repair the damaged superblock by hand and save untold
hours of work. The day was saved.</p><p>4. ...Ross Biro and the Linux TCP/IP code? Back in the early
days of the Linux kernel (a mind-staggering two years ago), there
was no networking support in the Linux kernel whatsoever. Many
users were forced to boot MS-DOS (or some other operating system)
to talk to the network&mdash;others resorted to more dated methods such
as (gasp) UUCP.</p><p>The first generation of the Linux TCP/IP code (now known as
&ldquo;NET-1&rdquo;, but that is a posthumous title) was developed by many
people, Ross Biro being one of the foremost. Although it supported
a limited range of hardware (Ethernet only, of course&mdash;SLIP was out
of the question), and was far from perfect, it was really quite
impressive at the time. Well, perhaps I should put that another
way. After pulling an all-nighter to hack the alpha TCP/IP code
into my, er, &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; kernel, you'd better believe that I was
impressed. After wrestling with compilation errors and kernel
panics all night, bloodshot and weary, I remember running telnet
just as the first rays of dawn made their way through the
window&mdash;and it worked! Of course, the kernel crashed five minutes
later, but it was good enough for me. &ldquo;Login or bust!&rdquo; was my motto
for the evening.</p><p>Ross was one of the key figures in the development of the
Linux TCP/IP suite, along with Don Becker and others. However, as
more and more Linux users attempted to employ their code, more and
more problems would emerge&mdash;inevitably causing Ross' mailbox to be
flooded with unwarranted complaints and flames. Not long thereafter
Ross &ldquo;threw in the towel&rdquo;, tired of the inappropriate treatment by
the Linux user community. The Linux development effort lost an
important player on that day. (The moral of the story? I
forget.)</p><p>5. ...Shoelace? These were short lengths of string or cord,
used to tie shoes, that were eventually driven into obsolescence by
Velcro. Wait a minute! Shoelace was actu-ally the predecessor to
LILO, which as we all know is the LInux LOader, responsible for
booting Linux (and whatever other operating systems you may have
installed). Shoelace was originally the only way to boot Linux from
the hard drive&mdash;and most Linux users at the time used a kernel
floppy. What did using Shoelace entail? The exact details are lost
in the mists of time, but I do remember having to modify sectors
508 and 509 of the kernel image&mdash;by hand&mdash;in order to set the root
filesystem device. (In fact, this was necessary even if you didn't
use Shoelace&mdash;but manual editing of kernel images is something that
Linux veterans always love to brag about.)</p><p>Another caveat associated with Shoelace was that it could
only be recompiled under Minix. In fact, the Linux kernel once
shared the same fate: One had to have Minix installed in order to
compile the Linux kernel&mdash;and, at one time, to even install the
Linux software. (This period was to Linux what the Dark Ages were
to European history. Minus famine and cultural stagnation, of
course.)</p><p>6. ...The original Linux FAQ? (Perhaps this question should
read, &ldquo;Do you want to remember the original Linux FAQ?&rdquo;) The
original list of Linux Frequently Asked Questions was coordinated
by Marc-Michel Corsini (although the first version was posted by
Robert Blum). It was a dinosaur of a document. The list of authors
and contributors numbered in the dozens, and the number of mistakes
and incongruencies topped that. It was a valiant effort, mind
you&mdash;in fact, I maintained, or tried to maintain, several sections
of the FAQ before giving up. Eventually, as the document was
nearing critical mass (800K or so) and was posted in no less than 7
parts each month, everyone agreed that it was too long and
out-of-date to maintain any further. Ian Jackson rewrote the FAQ
from scratch, and we started the HOWTO project to pick up the
pieces. Since then things have been relatively peachy.</p><p>The last version of the original FAQ that I have archived is
from July 1993, which places it just before Ian's rewrite and the
comp.os.linux newsgroup split of that summer. Linux users who were
around at that time may remember the following classic excerpts,
both of which are attributed to Marc-Michel Corsini:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;The last-change-date of this posting is always
`two minutes ago'. :)&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The FAQ contains a lot of information sometimes
I've put it down in 3 different ways because people seem not to
understand what they read (or what I wrote, you know I'm just a
froggy and English is not my natural language). What I mean is that
not all is in the FAQ but many things are there, so please just
take time to read it this will spare a lot of the other Linuxers
[and if you think I should rephrase some Q/A just drop me a note
with the corrections].&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbf580.0xdb7d98"></a>Now, those were the days.</h2></div></div><p>This list could go on and on, but I believe to have made my
point by now. As a matter of fact, most Linux users won't remember
those important milestones of Linux development such as, oh, the
introduction of the VFS layer, the original implementation of
shared libraries, and the first version of the Extended Filesystem.
But let sleeping dogs lie.</p><p>If this brief excursion into the dark annals of Linux history
has taught you one thing, it is that you should be grateful for
those foolhearty pioneers that worked for peanuts to blaze the
trail for the masses to follow. They had to edit their kernel
images by hand, and walk five miles in the snow&mdash;barefoot&mdash;just to
upload the newest set of patches, you know.</p><p>And the next time you consider complaining that running Lucid
Emacs 19.05 via NFS from a remote Linux machine in Paraguay doesn't
seem to get the background colors right, you'll know who to
thank.</p></div></div>
