<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Boot times can become slow on systems with many CPUs, partly because of the time
it takes to crank up all the <span   class="bold"><b>RAM chips</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Mel
Gorman</b></span> recently submitted some
patches to start up RAM chips in parallel instead of one after the other. One
of the main problems with trying to implement such a feature&mdash;and one of the
main reasons such patches haven't made it into the kernel before&mdash;is the
need to avoid slowing things down for smaller systems.
</p><p>
Mel's patches modified the <span   class="bold"><b>kswapd</b></span> code to give each CPU its own RAM
initialization thread. On smaller systems this theoretically would amount to
no change at all, while larger systems could see dramatically reduced boot
times.
</p><p>
An initial test by <span   class="bold"><b>Waiman Long</b></span> reported a 25% reduction in boot time on his
12 terabyte system&mdash;from 404 seconds to 298. And when <span   class="bold"><b>Peter Zijlstra</b></span> and Mel
asked if this made a worthwhile difference to him, Waiman replied:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Booting
100s faster is certainly something that is nice to have. Right now, more time
is spent in the firmware POST portion of the bootup process than in the OS
boot. So I would say this patch isn't really critical right now as machines
with that much memory are relatively rare. However, if we look forward to the
near future, some new memory technology like persistent memory is coming, and
machines with large amount of memory (whether persistent or not) will become
more common. This patch will certainly be useful if we look forward into the
future.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And <span   class="bold"><b>Scott J. Norton</b></span> also added, &ldquo;100 seconds really does matter and is a big
deal. When businesses have one of these large machines go down, their business
is stopped (unless they have a fast failover solution in place). Every minute
and second the machine is down is crucial to these businesses.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There was a bit of a push by <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> for Mel to simplify his code, but
Mel felt that Andrew's suggestions could make things worse, such as forcing
the kernel to rely on user-space code. And so long as systems keep getting
bigger, patches like these seemed destined for eventual acceptance.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has invited Linux kernel engineers to assist in development for chips
that are so new that their in-house developers must code on software
simulations of the eventual hardware.
</p><p>
The patches, released by <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Hansen</b></span>,
wouldn't run for anyone outside Intel&mdash;since no one else has those
chips&mdash;but he was hoping for feedback on their
implementation of <span   class="bold"><b>Memory Protection Keys</b></span> for user space.
</p><p>
The underlying idea involves utilizing previously unused bits from existing
registers and introducing new registers and associated assembler
instructions to secure system memory on a page-by-page basis. Essentially,
this gives users the ability to enable a particular set of actions on a given
set of pages, while prohibiting others.
</p><p>
When <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> asked Dave to list some potential use cases for this chip
feature, Dave replied that there were various things that a user might want
to protect, such as the following: &ldquo;Data structures like logs or journals that are only
written to in very limited code paths, but that you want to protect from
'stray' writes.&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;a database where a query operation will never need to
write to memory, but an insert would. You could keep the data R/O during the
entire operation except when an insert is actually in progress.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> also suggested:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You also can use it for certain types of emulator trickery, and I suspect
even for things like interpreters and controlling access to
&ldquo;tainted&rdquo; values.
</p><p>
Other obvious uses are making it a shade harder for SSL or ssh type errors to
leak things like key data by reducing the damage done by out of bound
accesses.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ingo asked if there could be any issues surrounding this feature existing on
some CPUs but not others. And Dave replied, &ldquo;It's always a problem with new
CPU features.&rdquo; He then went on to say:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I've thought a bit about trying to &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; the feature on older CPUs using
good ol' mprotect() so that we could have an API that folks can use
<span   class="emphasis"><em>today</em></span>,
but that would get magically fast on future CPUs. But, the problem with that
is the thread-local aspect.
</p><p>
mprotect() is fundamentally process-wide and protection keys right are
fundamentally thread-local. Those things are going to be hard to reconcile
unless we do something slightly extreme like having per-thread page tables.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The discussion got technical, but clearly the main question is how to support
the new chip features, rather than whether to support them at all.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> has extended <span   class="bold"><b>module signing</b></span> to support signing firmware as
well. Eventually, he figures it should be possible to sign user data too. This
seemed to be a natural extension of existing features and not very
controversial. But, there are certain differences between the firmware signing
code and the module signing code; for example, Luis' code introduces
separate files to contain the firmware signatures as a means to better
handle licensing issues.
</p><p>
Luis' patches also &ldquo;do not taint the kernel in the permissive [firmware]
signing mode due to restrictions on the firmware_class API; extensions to
enable this are expected, however, in the future.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Copay&mdash;the Next-Generation Bitcoin Wallet</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When I hear the word &ldquo;copay&rdquo;, I think of the doctor's office. Thankfully,
the Copay app from the folks at Bitpay doesn't cost you anything, and
it keeps your Bitcoin healthy and secure. I've mentioned many Bitcoin
wallet applications and cloud solutions during the past few years, but
Copay truly is different. It has features other wallets can't touch, such
as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Truly cross-platform with availability for Android, iOS, Windows, OS X,
Linux and Chrome.
</p></li><li><p>
Fast Bitcoin communication with Bitcoin network, no blockchain download.
</p></li><li><p>
Payment verification (BIP-0070-0073).
</p></li><li><p>
Shared wallets (multi-party transfer approval).
</p></li><li><p>
Wallet backups, multi-device access of same wallet.
</p></li><li><p>
100% open, downloadable source code hosted on GitHub.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'll admit the first time I tried Copay, I didn't quite understand the
hype. It feels like every other app accessing a cloud-based Bitcoin wallet
(for example, Coinbase). But Copay is an actual wallet, with private keys stored
only where you back them up. Thankfully, it allows simple backup of your
wallet keys, so you can access your Bitcoin from multiple locations. In
fact, you really really <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> need to have your wallet backed up and/or
accessed from multiple locations. If you lose your phone and don't have
a backup of your wallet, there's no way to recover your Bitcoin.

Thanks to its devotion to multi-platform open-source development

gets this month's Editors' Choice award. If you want to manage your

<h2 class="title">BitTorrentSync: Dropbox for Nerds</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's not really fair to compare Dropbox directly with
BitTorrentSync. First of all, my title implies Dropbox is somehow
inferior. To be honest, I haven't found anything that works as
smoothly as Dropbox when it comes to sync reliability and ease of
installation. That said, although it has incredible strengths, it also has
a few shortcomings. One, it's not free, and if you have a lot of data,
it can be expensive. Two, your data is stored on the Dropbox servers. The
second one is a showstopper for many folks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11901bitf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
BitTorrentSync uses the BitTorrent protocol to keep multiple locations in
sync. Everything is stored on your own machines, and you're limited only
by your own storage limitations. The basic features of BitTorrentSync
are free, but like Dropbox, there is a paid version. For me, quantity
of storage is the most important feature with a syncing app, and with
BitTorrentSync, that's unlimited. If you've been in the market for a
Dropbox replacement, I urge you to check out BitTorrentSync (or more
properly just &ldquo;Sync&rdquo; as it's been rebranded, probably due to
the bad press &ldquo;torrents&rdquo; get). It's matured
to the point that I trust it with my data, and its cross-platform nature
makes it easy to distribute. Grab a copy at <a href="http://www.getsync.com" target="_self">www.getsync.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: PlexConnect</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Plex. It might be a secret,
however, that I live in a house with quite a few Apple products. That
said, I find the Apple TV to be one of the most limiting, frustrating set-top
boxes to work with. (I'm sure most readers would agree.) I prefer to be
a lover, not a hater, so I searched long and hard to find a way to make
the Apple TV suck less. Thanks to PlexConnect, I succeeded.
</p><p>
The Apple TV is still not rootable (if you see claims that it is, you're
likely being bamboozled). PlexConnect works around the walled garden of
iOS by hijacking an official Apple app (the Trailers app specifically)
and allowing access to a Plex server.
</p><p>
The open-source PlexConnect is really just a brilliant translation
layer that hijacks DNS (pointing <a href="http://trailers.apple.com" target="_self">trailers.apple.com</a> to the PlexConnect
server IP) and feeds the Apple TV data formatted like it expects. Rather
than showing a listing of recent movie trailers, however, PlexConnect
shows a direct interface with your Plex media server. And to be honest,
the interface is actually surprisingly pleasant to use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11901fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11901fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you're stuck using an Apple TV for your living-room media playing, or
if you'd simply like to hop over that walled garden just because you can,
check out PlexConnect today. It's open source and available on GitHub:

<h2 class="title">iTVMediaCenter: Scam or Brilliance?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The folks at iTVMediaCenter recently contacted me about their
one-stop-shop solution for cord-cutters. For $14.99, they sell a program
that consolidates tons of on-line media into a central location so you can
watch it on demand. The problem is, it looks like the application does
little more than open the same Web sites you can open with a browser. Also,
the &ldquo;one-time fee&rdquo; is rumored to be an annual fee. I can't verify whether
the fee is recurring, but honestly, I don't recommend it either
way. What I can recommend, however, is to visit their Web site!
</p><p>
Although the application is seemingly a bust, the Web site is free, and
it does a decent job of linking to dozens and dozens of on-line streaming
sites. If you're looking for some free on-line media, but don't know
where to begin, go to <a href="http://itvmediacenter.com" target="_self">itvmediacenter.com</a> and
check out the
on-line offerings. I urge you to be cautious about the application,
but I found the free on-line catalog to be very helpful.

<h2 class="title">Finite-Element Methods for PDEs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #257, September 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the common classes of equations that is encountered in several
branches of science is partial differential equations. So in this article, I
look at a software package called FreeFem++ that is designed to help you
calculate these partial differential equations (<a href="http://www.freefem.org" target="_self">www.freefem.org</a>). 
</p><p>
One popular method of
solving these types of equations, and the one FreeFem++ uses, is the
finite-element method (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method</a>). The basic idea with this method is to take the
entire problem domain and subdivide it into a mesh of smaller regions. You
then apply a simplified version of the partial differential equations that
still is locally valid. This makes the problem a tractable one that 
actually can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. 
</p><p>
FreeFem++ is 
available in several different flavors. The earlier versions were named
freefem, freefem3D and freefem+. The latest version is called FreeFem++
and is written in C++. It can be compiled and runs on all three major
operating systems, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Since this is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I focus on Linux here. 
On Debian-based distributions, installation
is as easy as:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install freefem++
</pre>
</p><p>
The other versions also are available as the freefem and
freefem3d packages. 
</p><p>
Although I am specifically discussing solving electromagnetic
fields in this article, FreeFem++ is a general finite-element method solver. This means it
should be able to deal with most partial differential equations.
</p><p>
Once it is installed, you will want to start using it. The first thing to
be aware of is that FreeFem++ is designed to be used for
&ldquo;production-level&rdquo;
work&mdash;meaning active, high-level research work. As such, it does not
have a pretty front end to help new users through their first attempts
at using it. It is best to think of FreeFem++ as a programming language
that you use to write a program to solve your problem. 
</p><p>
The first step is
to define the geometry of your problem. This step is usually called meshing,
or building a mesh. FreeFem++ does not include any CAD functionality to build
geometries directly. You can, however, generate meshes automatically 
from a set of border descriptions. FreeFem++ can take a set of equations
describing your geometry and generate a mesh based on the Delaunay-Voronoi
algorithm. As a simple example, let's say you wanted to build a square
object. You could create the related mesh with these commands:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
int sides = 8;
mesh Th = square(sides, sides);
</pre>
</p><p>
From this first example, you should notice that the language FreeFem++ uses
is very similar to C/C++. Variables are typed and can store values only of
that type. The language is also polymorphic, so commands and operations
will do different things based on the types of the parameters or operands.
</p><p>
You can define more complex shapes with border functions. An example looks
like this:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
border aa(t=0, 2*pi) {x=cos(t); y=sin(t);}
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can hand these types of objects in to the
<tt  >buildmesh()</tt> function
to generate the same type of mesh you would have received from the
higher-level <tt  >square()</tt> function. 
</p><p>
If you want to see what these equations actually
look like (to verify that you have it correct), you can use the
<tt  >plot()</tt>
function to visualize them. 
You can hand in the border functions you may
have created or even the mesh object you get from
<tt  >buildmesh()</tt>. 
</p><p>
Once the
mesh is created, you need to create a set of two-dimensional spaces from this
mesh in order to solve your problem. This is done with the 
<tt  >fespace</tt> function:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
fespace Vh(Th, P1);
Vh u,v;
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >P1</tt> parameter tells
<tt  >fespace</tt> what type of finite element you want,
whether it is continuous or discontinuous, smooth, linear or with a bubble.
(A rather large set of possibilities is available that will be left as
an exercise for the dear reader.) 
</p><p>
Next, you need to define the finite-element functions within this newly generated space&mdash;in this case
<tt  >u</tt> and
<tt  >v</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that you have all of the background scaffolding built, you need to
define your problem and solve it within your problem geometry. You
can use the <tt  >problem</tt> type to define a more complex problem. As an example,
you might want to look at the cooling of a hot plate. The following would
set up the problem for you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mesh Th=square(30,5,[6*x,y]);
fespace Vh(Th, P1);
Vh u=u0, v, uold;
problem thermic(u,v)=int2d(Th)(u*v/dt + k*(dx(u) 
 &#8618;* dx(v) + dy(u) * dy(v)))
              + int1d(Th,1,3)(alpha*u*v)
              - int1d(Th,1,3)(alpha*ue*v)
              - int2d(Th)(uold*v/dt) + on(2,4,u=u0);
</pre>
</p><p>
The variable name <tt  >thermic</tt> is now a function call. When you issue the
command <tt  >thermic</tt>, FreeFem++ will go ahead and solve this problem that you
defined. The purpose for this method is to be able to define your problem
and make alterations and adjustments before actually solving it. 
</p><p>
If the
problem is simpler to define, you can use the <tt  >solve</tt> command to define
your problem and do the solving step immediately. For example, if you
wanted to model motion on a membrane, you could use something like this:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
solve Laplace(phi,w)=int2d(Th)(dx(phi)*dx(w) 
 &#8618;+ dy(phi)*dy(w))
          - int2d(Th)(f*w) + on(Gamma1, phi=z);
</pre>
</p><p>
where the appropriate finite-element space and functions have been defined.
Once FreeFem++ has solved your problem, you can use
<tt  >plot</tt> with the finite-element functions to visualize the actual results of this numerical
solution.
</p><p>
Although being able to visualize the results of your work immediately is
important, you need to have a way of saving this work so you don't
need to repeat any calculations unnecessarily. You can save meshes
that are generated with the <tt  >savemesh</tt> function. You simply need to hand in
the mesh to save and a filename to use:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
savemesh(Th, "my_mesh.msh");
</pre>
</p><p>
You can reload this mesh at a later time with the
<tt  >readmesh</tt> command, for
example:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
mesh Sh = readmesh("my_mesh.msh");
</pre>
</p><p>
Outputting results is a bit more of a hassle. You have access to the
standard C++ input/output streams, specifically cin and cout, so you can
dump out the numerical results that way. You also can create a new output
stream with <tt  >ofstream</tt> to write things out to a specific file, rather than
to what standard output is redirected to. In this way, you have full
control over what data gets saved, and what format this file and its
data uses.
</p><p>
Now that you've read this introduction to FreeFem++, you should take a
look at other tutorials and documentation on the Web.
Several good examples are available that should give you at least a
starting point to solve the specific problem you are investigating. If
the problem you are trying to solve is especially large, FreeFem++ also has
MPI support available. In this way, you can spread your calculations over
potentially hundreds of CPUs and hopefully get even more work done.
