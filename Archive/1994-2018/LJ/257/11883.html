UEFI secure boot often is regarded as a nuisance for Linux
users, but you can use it to protect your system by taking control of
it. Read on to learn how to do this, sign your own bootloader and protect your
whole system with full disk encryption (including the kernel).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135c408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is the open, multi-vendor
replacement for the aging BIOS standard, which first appeared in IBM
computers in 1976. The UEFI standard is extensive, covering the full
boot architecture. This article focuses on a single useful but typically
overlooked feature of UEFI: secure boot.
</p><p>
Often maligned, you've probably encountered UEFI secure boot only when
you disabled it during initial setup of your computer. Indeed, the
introduction of secure boot was mired with controversy over Microsoft
being in charge of signing third-party
operating system code that would boot under a secure boot environment.
</p><p>
In this article, we explore the basics of secure boot and how to take
control of it. We describe how to install your own keys and sign your
own binaries with those keys. We also show how you can build a single
standalone GRUB EFI binary, which will protect your system from
tampering, such as cold-boot attacks. Finally, we show how full disk
encryption can be used to protect the entire hard disk, including the
kernel image (which ordinarily needs to be stored unencrypted).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135c670"></a>
UEFI Secure Boot</h2></div></div><p>
Secure boot is designed to protect a system against malicious code being
loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating
system has been loaded. This is to prevent malicious software from
installing a &ldquo;bootkit&rdquo; and maintaining control over a computer to mask
its presence. If an invalid binary is loaded while secure boot is
enabled, the user is alerted, and the system will refuse to boot the
tampered binary.
</p><p>
On each boot-up, the UEFI firmware inspects each EFI binary that is
loaded and ensures that it has either a valid signature (backed by a
locally trusted certificate) or that the binary's checksum is present on
an allowed list. It also verifies that the signature or checksum does
not appear in the deny list. Lists of trusted certificates or checksums
are stored as EFI variables within the non-volatile memory used by the
UEFI firmware environment to store settings and configuration data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135c828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
UEFI Key Overview</b></p><p>
The four main EFI variables used for secure boot are shown in Figure a. The Platform Key (often abbreviated to PK) offers full control
of the secure boot key hierarchy. The holder of the PK can install a new
PK and update the KEK (Key Exchange Key). This is a second key, which
either can sign executable EFI binaries directly or be used to sign the
db and dbx databases. The db (signature database) variable contains a
list of allowed signing certificates or the cryptographic hashes of
allowed binaries. The dbx is the inverse of db, and it is used as a
blacklist of specific certificates or hashes, which otherwise would have
been accepted, but which should not be able to run. Only the KEK and db
(shown in green) keys can sign binaries that may boot the system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11883fa.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure a. Secure Boot Keys
</p></div></div><p>
The PK on most systems is issued by the manufacturer of the hardware,
while a KEK is held by the operating system vendor (such as Microsoft).
Hardware vendors also commonly have their own KEK installed (since
multiple KEKs can be present). To take full ownership of a computer
using secure boot, you need to replace (at a minimum) the PK and KEK, in
order to prevent new keys being installed without your consent. You
also should replace the signature database (db) if you want to prevent
commercially signed EFI binaries from running on your system. 
</p></div><p>
Secure boot is designed to allow someone with physical control over a
computer to take control of the installed keys. A pre-installed
manufacturer PK can be programmatically replaced only by signing it with
the existing PK. With physical access to the computer, and access to the
UEFI firmware environment, this key can be removed and a new one
installed. Requiring physical access to the system to override the
default keys is an important security requirement of secure boot to
prevent malicious software from completing this process. Note that some
locked-down ARM-based devices implement UEFI secure boot without the
ability to change the pre-installed keys.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135ccf8"></a>
Testing Procedure</h2></div></div><p>
You can follow these procedures on a physical computer, or alternatively
in a virtualized instance of the Intel Tianocore reference UEFI
implementation. The <tt  >ovmf</tt> package available in
most Linux distributions includes this. The QEMU virtualization tool can
launch an instance of <tt  >ovmf</tt> for experimentation. Note
that the <tt  >fat</tt>
argument specifies that a directory, <tt  >storage</tt>, will be presented to the
virtualized firmware as a persistent storage volume. Create this
directory in the current working directory, and launch QEMU:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -net none \
-m 1024 -pflash /usr/share/ovmf/ovmf_x64.bin \
-hda fat:storage/
</pre>
</p><p>
Files present in this folder when starting QEMU will appear as a volume
to the virtualized UEFI firmware. Note that files added to it after
starting QEMU will not appear in the system&mdash;restart QEMU and they
will
appear. This directory can be used to hold the public keys you want to
install to the UEFI firmware, as well as UEFI images to be booted later
in the process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135d010"></a>
Generating Your Own Keys</h2></div></div><p>
Secure boot keys are self-signed 2048-bit RSA keys, in X.509 certificate
format. Note that most implementations do not support key lengths
greater than 2048 bits at present. You can generate a 2048-bit keypair
(with a validity period of 3650 days, or ten years) with the following
<tt  >openssl</tt> command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout PK.key \
-out PK.crt -days 3650 -subj "/CN=My Secure PK/"
</pre>
</p><p>
The CN subject can be customized as you wish, and its value is not
important. The resulting PK.key is a private key, and PK.crt is the
corresponding certificate (containing the public key), which you will
install into the UEFI firmware shortly. You should store the private
key securely on an encrypted storage device in a safe place.
</p><p>
Now you can carry out the same process for both the KEK and for the db key.
Note that the db and KEK EFI variables can contain multiple keys
(and in the case of db, SHA256 hashes of bootable binaries), although
for simplicity, this article considers only storing a single certificate
in each. This is more than adequate for taking control of your own
computer. Once again, the .key files are private keys, which should be
stored securely, and the .crt files are public certificates to be
installed into your UEFI system variables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135d2d0"></a>
Taking Ownership and Installing Keys</h2></div></div><p>
Every UEFI firmware interface differs, and it is therefore not possible
to provide step-by-step instructions on how to install your own keys.
Refer to your motherboard or laptop's instruction manual, or search
on-line for the maker of the UEFI firmware. Enter the UEFI firmware
interface, usually by holding a key down at boot time, and locate the
security menu. Here there should be a section or submenu for secure
boot. Change the mode control to &ldquo;custom&rdquo; mode. This should allow you to
access the key management menus.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11883f1.large.jpg"><img src="11883f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Enabling Secure Boot and Entering Custom Mode
</p></div></div><p>
At this point, you should make a backup of the UEFI platform keys
currently installed. You should not need this, since there should be an
option within your UEFI firmware interface to restore the default keys,
but it does no harm to be cautious. There should be an option to export
or save the current keys to a USB Flash drive. It is best to format this
with the FAT filesystem if you have any issues with it being detected.
</p><p>
After you have copied the backup keys somewhere safe, load the public
certificate (.crt) files you created previously onto the USB Flash
drive. Take care not to mix them up with the backup certificates from
earlier. Enter the UEFI firmware interface, and use the option to reset
or clear all existing secure boot keys.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11883f2.large.jpg"><img src="11883f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Erasing the Existing Platform Key
</p></div></div><p>
This also might be referred to as &ldquo;taking ownership&rdquo; of secure boot.
Your system is now in secure boot &ldquo;setup&rdquo; mode, which will remain until
a new PK is installed. At this point, the EFI PK variable is unprotected
by the system, and a new value can be loaded in from the UEFI firmware
interface or from software running on the computer (such as an
operating system).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11883f3.large.jpg"><img src="11883f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Loading a New Key from a Storage Device
</p></div></div><p>
At this point, you should disable secure boot temporarily, in order to
continue following this article. Your newly installed keys will remain
in place for when secure boot is enabled.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x135db68"></a>
Signing Binaries</h2></div></div><p>
After you have installed your custom UEFI signing keys, you need to sign
your own EFI binaries. There are a variety of different ways to build
(or obtain) these. Most modern Linux bootloaders are EFI-compatible (for
example, GRUB 2, rEFInd or gummiboot), and the Linux kernel itself can
be built as a bootable EFI binary since version 3.3. It's possible to
sign and boot any valid EFI binary, although the approach you take here
depends on your preference.
</p><p>
One option is to sign the kernel image directly. If your distribution
uses a binary kernel, you would need to sign each new kernel update
before rebooting your system. If you use a self-compiled kernel, you
would need to sign each kernel after building it. This approach, however,
requires you to keep on top of kernel updates and sign each image. This
can become arduous, especially if you use a rolling-release
distribution or test mainline release candidates. An alternative, and
the approach we used in this article, is to sign a locked-down
UEFI-compatible bootloader (GRUB 2 in the case of this article), and use
this to boot various kernels from your system.
</p><p>
Some distributions configure GRUB to validate kernel image signatures
against a distribution-specified public key (with which they sign all
kernel binaries) and disable editing of the kernel
<tt  >cmdline</tt> variable when
secure boot is in use. You therefore should refer to the documentation
for your distribution, as the section on ensuring your boot images are
encrypted would not be essential in this case.
</p><p>
The Linux <tt  >sbsigntools</tt> package is available from
the repositories of most Linux distributions and is a good first
port of call when signing UEFI binaries. UEFI secure boot binaries
should be signed with an Authenticode-format signature. The command of
interest is <tt  >sbsign</tt>, which is invoked as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sbsign --key DB.key --cert DB.crt unsigned.efi \
--output signed.efi
</pre>
</p><p>
Due to subtle variations in the implementation of the UEFI standards,
some systems may reject a correctly signed binary from 
<tt  >sbsign</tt>. The best alternative we found was to use the
<tt  >osslsigncode</tt> utility, which also generates
Authenticode signatures. Although this tool was not specifically intended
for use with secure boot, it produces signatures that match the
required specification. Since <tt  >osslsigncode</tt> does
not appear to be commonly included in distribution repositories, you
should build it from its source code. The process is relatively
straightforward and simply requires running <tt  >make</tt>,
which will produce the executable binary. If you encounter
any issues, ensure you have installed <tt  >openssl</tt>
and <tt  >curl</tt>, which are dependencies of the
package. (See Resources for a link to the source code
repository.)
</p><p>
Binaries are signed with <tt  >osslsigntool</tt> in a
similar manner to <tt  >sbsign</tt> (note that the hash is
defined as sha256 per the UEFI specification; this should not be
altered):

<pre     class="programlisting">
osslsigncode -certs DB.crt -key DB.key \
-h sha256 -in unsigned.efi -out signed.efi
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x17564f0"></a>
Booting with UEFI</h2></div></div><p>
After you have signed an EFI binary (such as the GRUB bootloader
binary), the obvious next step is to test it. Computers using the legacy
BIOS boot technology load the initial operating system bootloader from
the MBR (master boot record) of the selected boot device. The MBR
contains code to load a further (and larger) bootloader held within the
disk, which loads the operating system. In contrast, UEFI is designed to
allow for more than one bootloader to exist on one drive, without the
need for those bootloaders to cooperate or even know the others exist.
</p><p>
Bootable UEFI binaries are located on a storage device (such as a hard
disk) within a standard path. The partition containing these binaries is
referred to as the EFI System Partition. It has a partition ID of 0xEF00
in gdisk, the GPT-compatible equivalent to fdisk. This partition is
conventionally located at the beginning of the filesystem and formatted
with a FAT32 filesystem. UEFI-bootable binaries are then stored as files
in the EFI/BOOT/ directory.
</p><p>
This signed binary should now boot if it is placed at EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI within the EFI system partition or an
external drive, which is set as the boot device. It is possible to have
multiple EFI binaries available on one EFI system partition, which makes
it easier to create a multi-boot setup. For that to work however, the
UEFI firmware needs a boot entry created in its non-volatile memory.
Otherwise, the default filename (BOOTX64.EFI) will be used, if it exists.
</p><p>
To add a new EFI binary to your firmware's list of available binaries,
you should use the <tt  >efibootmgr</tt> utility. This
tool can be found in distribution repositories and often is used
automatically by the installers for popular bootloaders, such as GRUB.
</p><p>
At this point, you should re-enable secure boot within your UEFI
firmware. To ensure that secure boot is operating correctly, you should
attempt to boot an unsigned EFI binary. To do so, you can place a binary
(such as an unsigned GRUB EFI binary) at EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI on a FAT32-formatted USB Flash drive.
Use the UEFI firmware interface to set this drive as the current boot
drive, and ensure that a security warning appears, which halts the boot
process. You also should verify that an image signed with the default
UEFI secure boot keys does not boot&mdash;an Ubuntu 12.04 (or newer) CD or
bootable USB stick should allow you to verify this. Finally, you should
ensure that your self-signed binary boots correctly and without error.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x1756808"></a>
Installing Standalone GRUB</h2></div></div><p>
By default, the GRUB bootloader uses a configuration file stored at
/boot/grub/grub.cfg. Ordinarily, this file could be edited by anyone
able to modify the contents of your /boot partition, either by booting
to another OS or by placing your drive in another computer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x1756910"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Bootloader Security</b></p><p>
Prior to the advent of secure boot and UEFI, someone with physical
access to a computer was presumed to have full access to it. User
passwords could be bypassed by simply adding
<tt  >init=/bin/bash</tt> to the
kernel <tt  >cmdline</tt> parameter, and the computer would boot straight up into a
root shell, with full access to all files on the system.
</p><p>
Setting up full disk encryption is one way to protect your data from
physical attack&mdash;if the contents of the hard disk is encrypted, the
disk must be decrypted before the system can boot. It is not possible to
mount the disk's partitions without the decryption key, so the data is
protected.
</p><p>
Another approach is to prevent an attacker from altering the kernel
cmdline parameter. This approach is easily bypassed on most computers,
however, by installing a new bootloader. This bootloader need not
respect the restrictions imposed by the original bootloader. In many
cases, replacing the bootloader may prove unnecessary&mdash;GRUB and other
bootloaders are fully configurable by means of a separate configuration
file, which could be edited to bypass security restrictions, such as
passwords.
</p></div><p>
Therefore, there would be no real security advantage in signing the GRUB
bootloader, since the signed (and verified) bootloader would then load
unsigned modules from the hard disk and use an unsigned configuration
file. By having GRUB create a single, bootable EFI binary, containing
all the necessary modules and configuration files, you no longer need to
trust the modules and configuration file of your GRUB binary. After
signing the GRUB binary, it cannot be modified without secure boot
rejecting it and refusing to load. This failure would alert you to
someone attempting to compromise your computer by modifying the bootloader.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, this step may not be necessary on some
distributions, as their GRUB bootloader automatically will enforce
similar restrictions and checks on kernels when booted with secure boot
enabled. So, this section is intended for those who are not using
such a distribution or who wish to implement something similar
themselves for learning purposes.
</p><p>
To create a standalone GRUB binary, the
<tt  >grub-mkstandalone</tt>
tool is needed. This tool should be included as part of
recent GRUB2 distribution packages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grub-mkstandalone -d /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/ \
-O x86_64-efi --modules="part_gpt part_msdos" \
--fonts="unicode" --locales="en@quot" \
--themes=""  -o "/home/user/grub-standalone.efi" \
"boot/grub/grub.cfg=/boot/grub/grub.cfg"
</pre>
</p><p>
A more detailed explanation of the arguments used here is available on
the man page for <tt  >grub-mkstandalone</tt>. The
significant arguments are <tt  >-o</tt>, which specifies the output file to be
used, and the final string argument, specifying the path to the current
GRUB configuration file. The resulting standalone GRUB binary is
directly bootable and contains a memdisk, which holds the configuration
file and modules, as well as the configuration file. This GRUB binary
now can be signed and used to boot the system. Note that this process
should be repeated when the GRUB configuration file is re-generated,
such as after adding a new kernel, changing boot parameters or after
adding a new operating system to the list, since the embedded
configuration file will be out of date with the regular system one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x1756ff0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
A Licensing Warning</b></p><p>
As GRUB 2 is licensed under the GPLv3 (or later), this raises one
consideration to be aware of. Although not a consideration for individual
users (who simply can install new secure boot keys and boot a modified
bootloader), if the GRUB 2 bootloader (or indeed any other GPL-v3-licensed bootloader) was signed with a private signing key, and the
distributed computer system was designed to prevent the use of unsigned
bootloaders, use of the GPL-v3-licensed software would not be in
compliance with the licence. This is a result of the so-called
anti-tivo'ization clause of GPLv3, which requires that users be able to
install and execute their own modified version of GPLv3 software on a
system, without being technically restricted from doing so.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x1757200"></a>
Locking Down GRUB</h2></div></div><p>
To prevent a malicious user from modifying the kernel cmdline of your
system (for example, to point to a different init binary), a GRUB
password should be set. GRUB passwords are stored within the
configuration file, after being hashed with a cryptographic hashing
function. Generate a password hash with the
<tt  >grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</tt> command, which will prompt you to
enter a password.
</p><p>
The PBKDF2 function is a slow hash, designed to be computationally
intensive and prevent brute-force attacks against the password. Its
performance is adjusted using the <tt  >-c</tt> parameter, if desired, to slow the
process further on a fast computer by carrying out more rounds of
PBKDF2. The default is for 10,000 rounds. After copying this password
hash, it should be added to your GRUB configuration files (which 
normally are located in /etc/grub.d or similar). In the file 40_custom, add
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root &lt;generated password hash&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a GRUB superuser account named root, which is able to
boot any GRUB entry, edit existing boot items and enter a GRUB console.
Without further configuration, this password also will be required to
boot the system. If you prefer to have yet another password on boot-up,
you can skip the next step. With full disk encryption in use though,
there is little need in requiring a password on each boot-up.
</p><p>
To remove the requirement for the superuser password to be entered on a
normal boot-up, edit the standard boot menu template (normally
/etc/grub.d/10-linux), and locate the line creating a regular menu
entry. It should look somewhat similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "menuentry '$(echo "$title" | grub_quote)' 
 &#8618;${CLASS} \$menuentry_id_option 
 &#8618;'gnulinux-$version-$type-$boot_device_id' {" | sed
 &#8618;"s/^/$submenu_indentation/"
</pre>
</p><p>
Change this line by adding the argument
<tt  >--unrestricted</tt>, before the
opening curly bracket. This change tells GRUB that booting this entry
does not require a password prompt. Depending on your distribution and
GRUB version, the exact contents of the line may differ. The resulting
line should be similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "menuentry '$(echo "$title" | grub_quote)' ${CLASS}
 &#8618;\$menuentry_id_option 
 &#8618;'gnulinux-$version-$type-$boot_device_id'
 &#8618;--unrestricted {" | sed "s/^/$submenu_indentation/"
</pre>
</p><p>
After adding a superuser account and configuring the need (or otherwise)
for boot-up passwords, the main GRUB configuration file should be
re-generated. The command for this is distribution-specific, but is
often <tt  >update-grub</tt> or
<tt  >grub-mkconfig</tt>. The standalone GRUB binary 
also should be re-generated and tested.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1264580.0x1757780"></a>
Protecting the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you should have a system capable of booting a signed (and
password-protected) GRUB bootloader. An adversary without access to your
keys would not be able to modify the bootloader or its configuration or
modules. Likewise, attackers would not be able to change the parameters
passed by the bootloader to the kernel. They could, however, modify your
kernel image (by swapping the hard disk into another computer). This
would then be booted by GRUB. Although it is possible for GRUB to verify
kernel image signatures, this requires you to re-sign each kernel update.
</p><p>
An alternative approach is to use full disk encryption to protect the
full system, including kernel images, the root filesystem and your home
directory. This prevents someone from removing your computer's drive and
accessing your data or modifying it&mdash;without knowing your encryption
password, the drive contents will be unreadable (and thus unmodifiable).
</p><p>
Most on-line guides will show full disk encryption but leave a separate,
unencrypted /boot partition (which holds the kernel and initrd images)
for ease of booting. By only creating a single, encrypted root
partition, there won't be an unencrypted kernel or initrd stored on the
disk. You can, of course, create a separate boot partition and encrypt
it using <tt  >dm-crypt</tt> as normal, if you prefer.
</p><p>
The full process of carrying out full disk encryption including the boot
partition is worthy of an article in itself, given the various
distribution-specific changes necessary. A good starting point, however,
is the ArchLinux Wiki (see Resources). The main difference from a conventional encryption setup is
the use of the GRUB <tt  >GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y</tt>
configuration parameter, which tells GRUB to attempt to decrypt an
encrypted volume prior to loading the main GRUB menu.
</p><p>
To avoid having to enter the encryption password twice per boot-up, the
system's <tt  >/etc/crypttab</tt> can be used to
decrypt the filesystem with a keyfile automatically. This keyfile 
then can be included in the (encrypted) initrd of the filesystem (refer to
your distribution's documentation to find out how to add this to the
initrd, so it will be included each time it is regenerated for a kernel
update).
</p><p>
This keyfile should be owned by the root user and does not require any
user or group to have read access to it. Likewise, you should give the
initrd image (in the boot partition) the same protection to prevent it
from being accessed while the system is powered up and the keyfile
is being extracted.

Final Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
UEFI secure boot allows you to take control over what code can run on
your computer. Installing your own keys allows you to prevent malicious
people from easily booting their own code on your computer. Combining
this with full disk encryption will keep your data protected against
unauthorized access and theft, and prevent an attacker from tricking you
into booting a malicious kernel.
</p><p>
As a final step, you should apply a password to your UEFI setup
interface, in order to prevent a physical attacker from gaining access
to your computer's setup interface and installing their own PK, KEK and
db key, as these instructions did. You should be aware, however, that a
weakness in your motherboard or laptop's implementation of UEFI could
potentially allow this password to be bypassed or removed, and that the
ability to re-flash the UEFI firmware through a &ldquo;rescue mode&rdquo; on your
system could potentially clear NVRAM variables. Nonetheless, by taking
control of secure boot and using it to protect your system, you should be
better protected against malicious software or those with temporary
physical access to your computer.
