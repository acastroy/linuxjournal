Want to optimize your Web application? First, decide what you mean by
&ldquo;fast&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cd460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Good news! One of my clients is launching a new marketing campaign,
which we expect will make the business even more successful than
before.
</p><p>
Bad news! This means our Web application, which has existed for
some time on a fairly simple infrastructure, and which has handled a
steadily growing number of users, now (we hope) will need to deal with
a massive spike in users.
</p><p>
The big question is this: can our servers handle the load we expect?
Indeed, what load can we expect? And, what happens if we need to crank
up even more capacity?
</p><p>
So in this article, I walk through some of the basic points having to do
with Web scalability, describing a few of the key things to keep in
mind. Next month, I'll take a deeper dive into these ideas and
discuss some of the techniques you can use to improve the speed&mdash;or
apparent speed&mdash;of your applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cd720"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
Many of my clients are companies that need a Web application, but
aren't familiar with the ways in which the Web works. A common
question for them to ask me is &ldquo;We have many thousands of users every
month. Can the server handle that many people?&rdquo; When I explain
that users consume server resources only when they actively are making
an HTTP request, their understanding begins to improve. A company
with 10,000 visitors a month doesn't need to worry about 10,000
simultaneous visitors; they likely will have some periods of time with
a few dozen and other periods of time with absolutely none. Thus,
scaling up their infrastructure to handle 10,000 simultaneous users
would be foolish.
</p><p>
At the same time, there are times&mdash;such as after launching an
advertising campaign or being mentioned on a TV show&mdash;that you 
indeed will have a huge spike in traffic. Companies that advertise during
the Super Bowl not only expect to get millions of viewers, they also expect
to have many of those people visit their Web sites after (or during)
watching the ads. This means normal assumptions for scaling
no longer are applicable.
</p><p>
This is one of the reasons why Amazon's EC2 has become so popular. If
you can treat a server as a commodity, paying for it by the hour and
spinning servers up and down as necessary, you can solve this scaling
problem. As traffic rises, you add more servers. As it falls,
you remove them.
</p><p>
But of course, life is more complicated than that. First and
foremost, every system has bottlenecks that can't just be wished away
by auto-scaling. For example, if it turns out that your database
can't handle a large load and you have only a single database
server, auto-scaling your Web servers may exacerbate the problem,
rather than solve it.
</p><p>
Second, although it's nice to imagine infinite budgets for auto-scaling
servers, it's probably a bit more realistic to think not just about
increasing the number of servers, but also about making each individual
server more efficient. If there are ways to improve the efficiency of
your code, that's often a good place to work on scaling, before
throwing (virtual) hardware at the problem.
</p><p>
Third, if you're in charge of a site's technical infrastructure,
your answer to the &ldquo;how many people can we serve
simultaneously&rdquo; question probably should not be &ldquo;it's infinite, assuming an
infinite budget&rdquo;. The technical staff might like that answer, but the
company's CFO might have a bit of an issue with giving the IT
department a blank check.

What Is Speed?</h2></div></div><p>
Many non-technical people will say &ldquo;I want to have a fast Web
site.&rdquo;
From a technical perspective, however, that's not a very useful
statement, because it neither differentiates between the different
types of speed, nor does it consider the multiple layers involved in a
modern Web application, nor does it take into consideration multiple
people and the crunch that comes from a sudden surge of interest in
the site.
</p><p>
So, let's consider the many different parts of a Web application and
how each of them might affect the speed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cdcf8"></a>
Speed</h2></div></div><p>
It's true that networks can have different speeds. In general, people
describe this in terms of bandwidth, which doesn't really mean that
the electrons (or photons) are moving through the wires (or fibers or
air) any faster, but rather that more of them
are pushing through, in parallel, at a time. You can think of bandwidth as a
straw through which you're trying to drink your favorite cold
beverage. Two straws will allow you to drink twice as much at the same
time and, thus, drink more quickly, even if the speed with which liquid
flows through each straw is the same.
</p><p>
One of the potential problems with using shared servers, and with
using a virtual machine on shared hardware, is that the network
capacity is being divided among the many users. Think of what would
happen if several people were to share your drinking straw from the
previous example. Sure, the overall straw might be the same size, but
each individual gets less than the full bandwidth. You don't need a
virtual machine to see such effects either&mdash;just try to run several
network-intensive applications on the same computer, and you'll
quickly find that they are competing for network resources.
</p><p>
The upshot here is that you want to maximize the bandwidth available
to your server. This means having your own server&mdash;even if it's a
VM, you probably don't want it sharing resources with other VMs&mdash;and
putting different services on different computers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16cdf08"></a>
Latency</h2></div></div><p>
This term also has to do with speed, but in a different way from pure
bandwidth. Let's say you want to transfer data between two huge
servers, so you put a huge, high-speed wire between those
networks. You would say that such a network has high bandwidth but
also low latency, since the signals would go between the two via a
high-speed wire.
</p><p>
Let's now replace that high-speed wire with a satellite link.
Suddenly, because it takes time to send the data from one network to
another, you have decreased your latency while keeping your bandwidth
identical. The network speed hasn't changed, but loading each page
now will take significantly longer. One of the major considerations
of a Web application is latency&mdash;of the networks on which the server
is running, but also of the application itself. If it takes several
seconds for a server to reply, you can say that the application
has high latency. This not only frustrates users (who have to wait
for a response from the server), but it also means that a larger number of
processes are running on the server at the same time, consuming
resources. Thus, reducing latency in a Web application is in the best
interest of users and of the company.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16ce068"></a>
Client-Side Wait Time</h2></div></div><p>
Many people, even those who have been using the Web for years, don't
understand that a single Web page is usually the result of dozens, and
sometimes even hundreds, of different files&mdash;often from different
servers. Of course, there's the HTTP response from the Web server,
but that might (will) then refer to JavaScript, CSS and static files
that might reside in a variety of places. JavaScript is a
particularly well known culprit in this arena, in that sites 
increasingly are downloading JavaScript from such sites as Google
Analytics, Optimizely, Facebook and the like.
</p><p>
The problem is that in order to display the complete Web page, your
browser needs to retrieve all of those individual pieces. Thus, one
delayed image or one delayed CSS file can cause the wait on the
user's side to be frustratingly long. Note that this has only partly
to do with the bandwidth and latency on the server. If your Web app
responds lightning-fast, but tells the user's browser to download a
JavaScript file from a very slow server, then from the user's
perspective, things might take a very long time.
</p><p>
This means you need to think about performance in new and
different ways from what you might have before. It's not enough to push all
of the files to the user's browser or to indicate from which sites
the user's browser can retrieve them. You also need to think about
where they are loaded. A &lt;script&gt; tag at the top of the page can have
very different performance characteristics than at the bottom of the
page, since browsers interpret and render tags from top to bottom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16ce278"></a>
Client-Side Performance</h2></div></div><p>
As if all of that weren't enough, it is increasingly becoming an era
of rich client-side Web applications. Regardless of whether you're
using something as simple as Backbone or as complex as Ember.js, you
are writing software that will be executing inside the user's
browser. For its first two decades, the Web was highly biased in
favor of the server, which also made it easier to scale, profile,
debug and improve programs. But, now that programs are running
inside different browsers, on users' computers, there is much more
to think and worry about.
</p><p>
A very small JavaScript program might allocate lots of memory and/or
take a long time to run. Or, a very large JavaScript program might be
straightforward, affecting the in-browser performance very little.
I've increasingly found my browser to be consuming a huge proportion
of my computer's CPU&mdash;not because I'm doing so much, but rather
because lots of JavaScript is executing there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15d5580.0x16ce3d8"></a>
What Does This All Mean?</h2></div></div><p>
Web development used to seem so simple. You get a domain, set up a
server, slap together some software, and you're in business. And
indeed, you often still can do that today. But, if you're expecting to
get lots of visitors at once, you need to understand the
different types of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; that you'll need to consider, measure and
then optimize.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll dig deeper into each of these types of speed,
looking at specific parts of your software that can affect each of
them. I'll give some specific suggestions for how you can identify
such issues, as well as solve them, particularly if you have some
low-hanging fruit.
