of the Internet Protocol, designed by the IETF as a successor to IP
version 4 (IPv4). In this article, we address the case of running
the Apache web server over IPv6.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1488a80"></a>The Apache Web Server</h2></div></div><p>According to the Netcraft web server survey, Apache has been
the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996.
Currently, over 56% of all web servers run Apache. These numbers
come as no surprise due to Apache's portability over multiple
platforms, reliability, robustness, configurability, and the fact
that it is free and well documented.</p><p>Apache 1.3 has established itself as a high-performance web
server. However, with the evolution of requirements imposed on web
servers, new functionalities, such as higher reliability, security
and performance and scalability are required. In response, Apache
continued its drive to satisfy these new requirements with version
2.0, promising a more robust and faster web server with new and
enhanced functionalities.</p><p>Apache 2.0 offers numerous performance improvements (the
subject of an article I wrote for the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site,
<a href="../000/4559.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/articles/4559</a>).
However, as far as this article is concerned, one of the new
features is support for IPv6. With the 2.0 version, if you run
Apache on systems where IPv6 support exists, Apache gets IPv6
listening sockets by default. Additionally, the Listen,
NameVirtualHost and VirtualHost directives also support IPv6
numeric address strings.</p><p>In the following sections, we demonstrate how to add support
for IPv6 in the Linux kernel and then show how to install the
latest Apache version and run it with IPv6 support. We also run
some benchmarking tests to compare the performance of the same
server servicing requests using IPv4 and IPv6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1488d40"></a>Supporting IPv6 at the Kernel Level</h2></div></div><p>In this section, we briefly describe how to enable IPv6 in
the Linux kernel, a prerequisite to enable IPv6 HTTP requests. You
may already have IPv6 support in your kernel [see page 64]. To add
it, the first step is to download a stable Linux kernel and
uncompress it. For our testing we downloaded kernel 2.4.8 from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>.</p><p>We configured the kernel to enable support for IPv6. There
are two options you need to enable. In the Code Maturity Level
section, you need to enable <b  >"Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers"</b>.</p><p>And in the Networking Options section, you need to enable
<b  >"IPv6 Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)"</b>.</p><p>You can choose to compile the IPv6 support within the kernel
or as a separate module, depending on your preference. After that,
compile and install the kernel and modules as usual, then reboot
with IPv6 support.</p><p>See the Kernel HOWTO for details on the kernel build and
install process
(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1489108"></a>Downloading and Installing Apache</h2></div></div><p>Now that your kernel supports IPv6, you are ready to install
Apache and run it with IPv6 support. First, download the latest
Apache distribution from
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd" target="_self">www.apache.org/dist/httpd</a>
into /tmp. For illustrative purposes we use Apache 2.0.16; however,
the same procedure applies to newer versions. Extract the
source:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp
tar xzvf httpd-2_0_16-beta.tar.gz
</pre><p>which will create a new directory, httpd-2_0_16, containing
the source code. To configure Apache for your platform and specific
requirements, use the configure script included in the root
directory of the distribution. You should <b  >cd</b>
into the httpd-2_0_16 directory and type
<b  >./configure</b> at the shell prompt. If you want to
know all the options you could pass to the configuration script,
type <b  >./configure --help</b>. To change the default
options, the configure script accepts a variety of variables and
command-line options. One of the options is the location prefix
where Apache is to be installed. By default, Apache will install
into /usr/local/apache. If you want to install Apache in
/usr/local/apache-2_0_16, for instance, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-2_0_16
</pre>


The same applies for other options. When
<b  >configure</b> is run it will take a few seconds to
test for the availability of features on your system and build
Makefiles that will be used to compile the server. After running
the configuration script, you can build the various parts that form
the Apache package by running <b  >make &amp;&amp; make
install</b>. This will compile Apache and install all the
files in /usr/local/apache-2_0_16. The next step is to customize
the Apache HTTP server by editing the httpd.conf file under
/usr/local/apache-2_0_16/conf or, if you have used a different
prefix, under <span   class="emphasis"><em>prefix</em></span>/conf/:
<pre     class="programlisting">
vi <span   class="emphasis"><em>prefix</em></span>/conf/httpd.conf
</pre>


The must-edit configuration variables include ServerAdmin, your
e-mail address (so you will be alerted in case the server has
problems); ServerName, the name or IP of the server; and Port, the
port to which the server should listen.
</p><p>The httpd.conf comes with a lot of explanations, and it is
easy to read, understand and customize. However, if you need more
details on the configuration directives, you can read the Apache
manual either locally under the docs/manual/ in the Apache
installation directory or on the Web at
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs" target="_self">httpd.apache.org/docs</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x14896e0"></a>Starting the Server</h2></div></div><p>Now you have compiled, installed and customized the Apache
configuration. As we mentioned previously, IPv6 support is now
included within the Apache source code, so you do not need to do
any special configuration to activate it. To start the server, you
can use the Apache Control Script that is designed to allow an easy
command-line interface to control Apache. Using it you can start
the server, stop it, restart it, check its status and do a
configuration syntax test. Therefore, to start the server you would
type <b  >apachectl start</b>, and then you should be
able to request documents via http://ServerName or
http://localhost/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1489840"></a>Serving Documents over IPv6</h2></div></div><p>With the advent of 128-bit addressing comes the pains of
typing long IP addresses. The correct syntax of an IPv6 address is
eight fields of four hexadecimal characters separated by colons,
totaling 128 bits. Note that in URLs, port numbers can be appended
to addresses following a colon, like this: 149.76.14.14:80. Since
IPv6 addresses already make use of the colon within the address
itself, the address in an IPv6 URL is enclosed in square brackets
and the colon and port appended after the closing square bracket,
like this: [3ffe:200:8:1000:250:bbff:fe00:25]:80.</p><p>Not all web browsers are capable of parsing IPv6 addresses.
Netscape Navigator 6.x and Mozilla are the two tested browsers that
do support IPv6 addresses. We believe that although their support
for IPv6 is not yet mature (as they sometimes freeze and require
killing the browser process or restarting it), both of them do
allow successful parsing of aliased hostnames. Aliased hostnames
are hostnames assigned to a unique IP address in /etc/hosts file.
For instance, we can define aliases for IPv6 address by editing
/etc/hosts as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
::1                             node02-v6-localhost
3ffe:200:8:1000:250:bbff:fe00:25 node02-v6
</pre><p>When we start Netscape or Mozilla, we type in the defined
aliases as the URL and use these aliases to request a web page over
IPv6, such as http://node2-v6/ or http://node2-v6-localhost/.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1489a50"></a>Benchmarking Results</h2></div></div><p>To benchmark the performance of Apache, we followed the above
steps to install the latest kernel with IPv6 support and install
Apache 2.0.16. The machine is a 1U Celeron 500MHz rackmount unit
with 256MB of RAM. It runs Red Hat 7.0. As for benchmarking, we
used ApacheBench, a tool that comes free with the Apache web
server.</p><p>We ran two tests: Apache 2.0.16 over IPv4 and then Apache
2.0.16 over IPv6. For comparison's sake, we ran the same tests on
another machine with the same setup, except with Apache 1.3.19, to
be able to compare the performance and support for IPv6 in the two
versions. To enable IPv6 with Apache 1.3.19, we downloaded the IPv6
Apache patch from the Kame Project web site and applied it to the
1.3.19 source tree. Next, we ran the configure script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --enable-rule=INET6
</pre><p>and enabled the INET6 option. Lastly, we did a <b  >make
&amp;&amp; make install</b>, which compiled and installed
Apache 1.3.19 with IPv6 support from Kame.
</p><p>Table 1 shows the results of the benchmarking tests. Each of
the benchmarks was the result of 1,000 requests with a concurrency
level of 1. There were no failed requests or write errors.</p><p><a href="5451t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Benchmarking
Results</a></p><p>There are few remarks regarding the results. Apache 1.3.19
was able to serve more requests per second than Apache 2.0.16. In
the tested versions of Apache, we had fewer requests per second in
IPv6 compared to IPv4; this may be due to the fact that the IPv6
code added to Apache has not been tested and debugged thoroughly.
On the other hand, if we examine the transfer rate of Apache
1.3.19, we notice that it is much higher than the transfer rate of
Apache 2.0.16. This still needs to be investigated.</p><p>At the Ericsson Open Architecture Research Lab, we currently
have a benchmarking environment to test the performance of our
Linux clusters and application servers (including Apache, Tomcat
and Jigsaw web servers). However, the environment and the tests are
designed to work with IPv4, not IPv6. Our plan is to port the
environment to generate IPv6 HTTP requests in order to test the
performance of Apache (and other web servers) with IPv6 under heavy
load. We currently have a total of 100 1U rackmount units (a mix of
Celeron 500 and Pentium III machines with 256MB and 512 MB of RAM)
that soon will be generating IPv6 traffic with one node collecting
and compiling the results. We will publish our results as soon as
the work is completed. This will be more comprehensive than the
preliminary testing that was done for the purposes of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x18820c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>IPv6 is becoming a reality. For the next few years, we need
to be able to support both IPv4 and IPv6 on our application servers
before the complete transition to IPv6 occurs. The developers of
Apache are aware of this, and they have already built in support
for IPv6 in the Apache code. Previously, the support for IPv6 was
in the form of a downloadable patch (from the Kame Project, for
instance) that you would apply to the source tree.</p><p>As the benchmarking results suggest, serving documents over
IPv6 is slightly slower (in terms of requests/second) than serving
them over IPv4; however, this is understandable because the IPv6
support is still in its early stages. As the development advances,
Apache is expected to reach and exceed the level of performance it
achieved with IPv4 to remain the preferred web server in the
world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1390580.0x1882220"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Ericsson Research (Open Architecture Research Lab) for
