    Explaining what is zero-copy functionality for Linux, why
    it's useful and where it needs work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23d9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>By now almost everyone has heard of
so-called zero-copy functionality under Linux, but I often run into
people who don't have a full understanding of the subject. Because
of this, I decided to write a few articles that dig into the matter
a bit deeper, in the hope of unraveling this useful feature. In
this article, we take a look at zero copy from a user-mode
application point of view, so gory kernel-level details are omitted
intentionally.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23d9608"></a>What Is Zero-Copy?</h2></div></div><p>To better understand the solution to a problem, we first need
to understand the problem itself. Let's look at what is involved in
the simple procedure of a network server d&aelig;mon serving data
stored in a file to a client over the network. Here's some sample
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
read(file, tmp_buf, len);
write(socket, tmp_buf, len);
</pre><p>Looks simple enough; you would think there is not much
overhead with only those two system calls. In reality, this
couldn't be further from the truth. Behind those two calls, the
data has been copied at least four times, and almost as many
user/kernel context switches have been performed. (Actually this
process is much more complicated, but I wanted to keep it simple).
To get a better idea of the process involved, take a look at Figure
1. The top side shows context switches, and the bottom side shows
copy operations.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6345f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Copying in Two Sample System Calls
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Step one: the read system call causes a context switch from
user mode to kernel mode. The first copy is performed by the DMA
engine, which reads file contents from the disk and stores them
into a kernel address space buffer.</p><p>Step two: data is copied from the kernel buffer into the user
buffer, and the read system call returns. The return from the call
caused a context switch from kernel back to user mode. Now the data
is stored in the user address space buffer, and it can begin its
way down again.</p><p>Step three: the write system call causes a context switch
from user mode to kernel mode. A third copy is performed to put the
data into a kernel address space buffer again. This time, though,
the data is put into a different buffer, a buffer that is
associated with sockets specifically.</p><p>Step four: the write system call returns, creating our fourth
context switch. Independently and asynchronously, a fourth copy
happens as the DMA engine passes the data from the kernel buffer to
the protocol engine. You are probably asking yourself, &ldquo;What do
you mean independently and asynchronously? Wasn't the data
transmitted before the call returned?&rdquo; Call return, in fact,
doesn't guarantee transmission; it doesn't even guarantee the start
of the transmission. It simply means the Ethernet driver had free
descriptors in its queue and has accepted our data for
transmission. There could be numerous packets queued before ours.
Unless the driver/hardware implements priority rings or queues,
data is transmitted on a first-in-first-out basis. (The forked DMA
copy in Figure 1 illustrates the fact that the last copy can be
delayed).</p><p>As you can see, a lot of data duplication is not really
necessary to hold things up. Some of the duplication could be
eliminated to decrease overhead and increase performance. As a
driver developer, I work with hardware that has some pretty
advanced features. Some hardware can bypass the main memory
altogether and transmit data directly to another device. This
feature eliminates a copy in the system memory and is a nice thing
to have, but not all hardware supports it. There is also the issue
of the data from the disk having to be repackaged for the network,
which introduces some complications. To eliminate overhead, we
could start by eliminating some of the copying between the kernel
and user buffers.</p><p>One way to eliminate a copy is to skip calling read and
instead call mmap. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tmp_buf = mmap(file, len);
write(socket, tmp_buf, len);
</pre><p>To get a better idea of the process involved, take a look at
Figure 2. Context switches remain the same.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6345f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Calling mmap
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Step one: the mmap system call causes the file contents to be
copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine. The buffer is shared
then with the user process, without any copy being performed
between the kernel and user memory spaces.</p><p>Step two: the write system call causes the kernel to copy the
data from the original kernel buffers into the kernel buffers
associated with sockets.</p><p>Step three: the third copy happens as the DMA engine passes
the data from the kernel socket buffers to the protocol
engine.</p><p>By using mmap instead of read, we've cut in half the amount
of data the kernel has to copy. This yields reasonably good results
when a lot of data is being transmitted. However, this improvement
doesn't come without a price; there are hidden pitfalls when using
the mmap+write method. You will fall into one of them when you
memory map a file and then call write while another process
truncates the same file. Your write system call will be interrupted
by the bus error signal SIGBUS, because you performed a bad memory
access. The default behavior for that signal is to kill the process
and dump core&mdash;not the most desirable operation for a network
server. There are two ways to get around this problem.</p><p>The first way is to install a signal handler for the SIGBUS
signal, and then simply call return in the handler. By doing this
the write system call returns with the number of bytes it wrote
before it got interrupted and the errno set to success. Let me
point out that this would be a bad solution, one that treats the
symptoms and not the cause of the problem. Because SIGBUS signals
that something has gone seriously wrong with the process, I would
discourage using this as a solution.</p><p>The second solution involves file leasing (which is called
&ldquo;opportunistic locking&rdquo; in Microsoft Windows) from the kernel.
This is the correct way to fix this problem. By using leasing on
the file descriptor, you take a lease with the kernel on a
particular file. You then can request a read/write lease from the
kernel. When another process tries to truncate the file you are
transmitting, the kernel sends you a real-time signal, the
RT_SIGNAL_LEASE signal. It tells you the kernel is breaking your
write or read lease on that file. Your write call is interrupted
before your program accesses an invalid address and gets killed by
the SIGBUS signal. The return value of the write call is the number
of bytes written before the interruption, and the errno will be set
to success. Here is some sample code that shows how to get a lease
from the kernel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if(fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, RT_SIGNAL_LEASE) == -1) {
    perror("kernel lease set signal");
    return -1;
}
/* l_type can be F_RDLCK F_WRLCK */
if(fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, l_type)){
    perror("kernel lease set type");
    return -1;
}
</pre><p>You should get your lease before mmaping the file, and break
your lease after you are done. This is achieved by calling fcntl
F_SETLEASE with the lease type of F_UNLCK.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23da0b0"></a>Sendfile</h2></div></div><p>In kernel version 2.1, the sendfile system call was
introduced to simplify the transmission of data over the network
and between two local files. Introduction of sendfile not only
reduces data copying, it also reduces context switches. Use it like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sendfile(socket, file, len);
</pre><p>To get a better idea of the process involved, take a look at
Figure 3.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6345f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Replacing Read and Write with Sendfile
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Step one: the sendfile system call causes the file contents
to be copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine. Then the data
is copied by the kernel into the kernel buffer associated with
sockets.</p><p>Step two: the third copy happens as the DMA engine passes the
data from the kernel socket buffers to the protocol engine.</p><p>You are probably wondering what happens if another process
truncates the file we are transmitting with the sendfile system
call. If we don't register any signal handlers, the sendfile call
simply returns with the number of bytes it transferred before it
got interrupted, and the errno will be set to success.</p><p>If we get a lease from the kernel on the file before we call
sendfile, however, the behavior and the return status are exactly
the same. We also get the RT_SIGNAL_LEASE signal before the
sendfile call returns.</p><p>So far, we have been able to avoid having the kernel make
several copies, but we are still left with one copy. Can that be
avoided too? Absolutely, with a little help from the hardware. To
eliminate all the data duplication done by the kernel, we need a
network interface that supports gather operations. This simply
means that data awaiting transmission doesn't need to be in
consecutive memory; it can be scattered through various memory
locations. In kernel version 2.4, the socket buffer descriptor was
modified to accommodate those requirements&mdash;what is known as zero
copy under Linux. This approach not only reduces multiple context
switches, it also eliminates data duplication done by the
processor. For user-level applications nothing has changed, so the
code still looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sendfile(socket, file, len);
</pre><p>To get a better idea of the process involved, take a look at
Figure 4.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6345f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Hardware that supports gather can assemble data from
multiple memory locations, eliminating another copy.
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Step one: the sendfile system call causes the file contents
to be copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine.</p><p>Step two: no data is copied into the socket buffer. Instead,
only descriptors with information about the whereabouts and length
of the data are appended to the socket buffer. The DMA engine
passes data directly from the kernel buffer to the protocol engine,
thus eliminating the remaining final copy.</p><p>Because data still is actually copied from the disk to the
memory and from the memory to the wire, some might argue this is
not a true zero copy. This is zero copy from the operating system
standpoint, though, because the data is not duplicated between
kernel buffers. When using zero copy, other performance benefits
can be had besides copy avoidance, such as fewer context switches,
less CPU data cache pollution and no CPU checksum
calculations.</p><p>Now that we know what zero copy is, let's put theory into
practice and write some code. You can download the full source code

To unpack the source code, type <b  >tar -zxvf
sfl-src.tgz</b> at the prompt. To compile the code and create
the random data file data.bin, run <b  >make</b>.</p><p>Looking at the code starting with header files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* sfl.c sendfile example program
Dragan Stancevic &lt;
header name                 function / variable
-------------------------------------------------*/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;          /* printf, perror */
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;          /* open */
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;         /* close */
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;          /* errno */
#include &lt;string.h&gt;         /* memset */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;     /* socket */
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;     /* sockaddr_in */
#include &lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;   /* sendfile */
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;      /* inet_addr */
#define BUFF_SIZE (10*1024) /* size of the tmp
                               buffer */
</pre><p>Besides the regular &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; and
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt; required for basic socket operation, we need a
prototype definition of the sendfile system call. This can be found
in the &lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt; server flag:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* are we sending or receiving */
if(argv[1][0] == 's') is_server++;
/* open descriptors */
sd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if(is_server) fd = open("data.bin", O_RDONLY);
</pre>


The same program can act as either a server/sender or a
client/receiver. We have to check one of the command-prompt
parameters, and then set the flag is_server to run in sender mode.
We also open a stream socket of the INET protocol family. As part
of running in server mode we need some type of data to transmit to
a client, so we open our data file. We are using the system call
sendfile to transmit data, so we don't have to read the actual
contents of the file and store it in our program memory buffer.
Here's the server address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* clear the memory */
memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
/* initialize structure */
sa.sin_family = PF_INET;
sa.sin_port = htons(1033);
sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(argv[2]);
</pre>


We clear the server address structure and assign the protocol
family, port and IP address of the server. The address of the
server is passed as a command-line parameter. The port number is
hard coded to unassigned port 1033. This port number was chosen
because it is above the port range requiring root access to the
system.
</p><p>Here is the server execution branch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if(is_server){
    int client; /* new client socket */
    printf("Server binding to [%s]\n", argv[2]);
    if(bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;sa,
                      sizeof(sa)) &lt; 0){
        perror("bind");
        exit(errno);
    }
</pre><p>As a server, we need to assign an address to our socket
descriptor. This is achieved by the system call bind, which assigns
the socket descriptor (sd) a server address (sa):
<pre     class="programlisting">
if(listen(sd,1) &lt; 0){
    perror("listen");
    exit(errno);
}
</pre>


Because we are using a stream socket, we have to advertise our
willingness to accept incoming connections and set the connection
queue size. I've set the backlog queue to 1, but it is common to
set the backlog a bit higher for established connections waiting to
be accepted. In older versions of the kernel, the backlog queue was
used to prevent syn flood attacks. Because the system call listen
changed to set parameters for only established connections, the
backlog queue feature has been deprecated for this call. The kernel
parameter tcp_max_syn_backlog has taken over the role of protecting
the system from syn flood attacks:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if((client = accept(sd, NULL, NULL)) &lt; 0){
    perror("accept");
    exit(errno);
}
</pre>


The system call accept creates a new connected socket from the
first connection request on the pending connections queue. The
return value from the call is a descriptor for a newly created
connection; the socket is now ready for read, write or poll/select
system calls:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if((cnt = sendfile(client,fd,&amp;off,
                          BUFF_SIZE)) &lt; 0){
    perror("sendfile");
    exit(errno);
}
printf("Server sent %d bytes.\n", cnt);
close(client);
</pre>


A connection is established on the client socket descriptor, so we
can start transmitting data to the remote system. We do this by
calling the sendfile system call, which is prototyped under Linux
in the following manner:
<pre     class="programlisting">
extern ssize_t
sendfile (int __out_fd, int __in_fd, off_t *offset,
          size_t __count) __THROW;
</pre>


The first two parameters are file descriptors. The third parameter
points to an offset from which sendfile should start sending data.
The fourth parameter is the number of bytes we want to transmit. In
order for the sendfile transmit to use zero-copy functionality, you
need memory gather operation support from your networking card. You
also need checksum capabilities for protocols that implement
checksums, such as TCP or UDP. If your NIC is outdated and doesn't
support those features, you still can use sendfile to transmit
files. The difference is the kernel will merge the buffers before
transmitting them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23d1758"></a>Portability Issues</h2></div></div><p>One of the problems with the sendfile system call, in
general, is the lack of a standard implementation, as there is for
the open system call. Sendfile implementations in Linux, Solaris or
HP-UX are quite different. This poses a problem for developers who
wish to use zero copy in their network data transmission
code.</p><p>One of the implementation differences is Linux provides a
sendfile that defines an interface for transmitting data between
two file descriptors (file-to-file) and (file-to-socket). HP-UX and
Solaris, on the other hand, can be used only for file-to-socket
submissions.</p><p>The second difference is Linux doesn't implement vectored
transfers. Solaris sendfile and HP-UX sendfile have extra
parameters that eliminate overhead associated with prepending
headers to the data being transmitted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23d1910"></a>Looking Ahead</h2></div></div><p>The implementation of zero copy under Linux is far from
finished and is likely to change in the near future. More
functionality should be added. For example, the sendfile call
doesn't support vectored transfers, and servers such as Samba and
Apache have to use multiple sendfile calls with the TCP_CORK flag
set. This flag tells the system more data is coming through in the
next sendfile calls. TCP_CORK also is incompatible with TCP_NODELAY
and is used when we want to prepend or append headers to the data.
This is a perfect example of where a vectored call would eliminate
the need for multiple sendfile calls and delays mandated by the
current implementation.</p><p>One rather unpleasant limitation in the current sendfile is
it cannot be used when transferring files greater than 2GB. Files
of such size are not all that uncommon today, and it's rather
disappointing having to duplicate all that data on its way out.
Because both sendfile and mmap methods are unusable in this case, a
sendfile64 would be really handy in a future kernel version.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e1580.0x23d1a70"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Despite some drawbacks, zero-copy sendfile is a useful
feature, and I hope you have found this article informative enough
to start using it in your programs. If you have a more in-depth
interest in the subject, keep an eye out for my second article,
titled &ldquo;Zero Copy II: Kernel Perspective&rdquo;, where I will dig a bit
more into the kernel internals of zero copy.</p><p><a href="6345s1.html" target="_self">Further Information</a></p></div></div>
