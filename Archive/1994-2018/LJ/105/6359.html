Logging&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, October 2002, also available at
<a href="../102/6222.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6222</a>].
That is a clever use of Snort, particularly as a means to send logs
to a remote host. Just a couple of comments as I read through the
article. In the Sidebar titled &ldquo;LAN Segments, Hubs and Switches&rdquo;
on page 38, it is not impossible to send logs to the Snort logging
host from a distant segment. Just ensure the Snort host is attached
to a valid IP subnet, and give the subnet's router a static ARP
entry that associates the Snort host's MAC address to an unused IP
address that is valid for the Snort host's subnet. With the method
of logging outlined in the article, it may still be possible to
compromise the integrity of the Snort logging host. An attacker may
be able to send their own log messages, which may be used either to
overflow the logging disk or to attack a potential vulnerability in
Snort's capture/parsing logic (if there ever was one).</p><p>&mdash;John Kristoff</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> Even a
stealth logger is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and
sniffer-specific application exploits. But in practical terms,
neither of these strikes me as a huge risk. I think it would be
pointless for an attacker to aim specifically to take out a stealth
logger via a DoS attack; that amount of traffic probably would also
take out the system you're actually trying to attack without being
logged. On the other hand, we should keep in mind that the
&ldquo;stealth sniffing&rdquo; technique is intended to mitigate the specific
threat of attacks against the logger's local TCP/IP stack and
applications. I do think it's useful for that and effectively
raises the bar considerably against would-be log-tamperers.
However, these are good observations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ed580.0x17e5450"></a>More C++ Coverage, Please</h2></div></div><p>I really enjoyed the article &ldquo;Memory Leak Detection in
Embedded Systems&rdquo; that appeared in the September 2002 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Lately I have been doing a lot
of C++ development with the DB2 UDB Administrative API, and
detecting memory leaks in both my code and IBM's is useful for
debugging purposes. Please feature more articles that address these
types of C++ development topics in 2003. An overview of compiler
and compiler tools (g++, Intel compilers, etc.) tools would be one
article in particular I would like to see run.</p><p>&mdash;Kevin Wittmer, Senior Software Developer, Expand Beyond,

Look</h2></div></div><p>I recently purchased the new Red Hat 8.0. I have been
following Red Hat since 5.1 and have purchased 6.0, 6.1, 7.2 and
downloaded 7.3. I find the new desktop, Bluecurve, to be a true
bastardization of both Gnome and KDE. Red Hat has removed all of
the character from Gnome and KDE and smudged the windowing into
their own proprietary look and feel. Konqueror is not the default
browser in the KDE menu, and CUPS is not installed by default. If I
want to go into KDE, I want KDE. If I want Gnome, give me Gnome,
not some smudging of the two. On the other hand, the beauty of open
source is that you can do what you want with it as long as you
publish the source code, and that is what Red Hat has done. Good
for them. But, Bluecurve should be called BLUE-SMUDGE.</p><p>&mdash;Tom Amon, IT Tech</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ed580.0x17e5818"></a>More on Getting Started?</h2></div></div><p>I love the magazine and enjoy it and sharing GNU/Linux with
everyone I know. When I got started with GNU/Linux I looked to
books and mags to help me, and what really helped me were any
tidbits of information that I could get. Marcel's sections are a
blast to read, and maybe something like that more directed to
newbies would help other new people in their exploration of
GNU/Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Matthew</p><p>If you enjoy sharing your knowledge, please visit our web
site (<a href="/" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>) for an author's

key left of the number one (1). This will facilitate typing of the
EXCLAMATION MARK (!) without using the Shift key. This is necessary
because EXCLAMATION MARK (!) is used very often while typing any
text. The key for the QUESTION MARK (?) should be brought down
below on the same key on which it is available presently, so that
Shift key need not be pressed. The OBLIQUE symbol (/) is very
rarely required. Lastly, the INDICATOR LIGHT ON for the CAPS LOCK
key, pressed for typing ALL CAPS, is not enough to highlight the
same. The INDICATOR LIGHT should not be constant. Instead, it
should go on blinking, preferably with a &ldquo;BEEP BEEP&rdquo; sound so as
to attract the attention of the USER, so that he undoes it after
his need to type ALL CAPS is over. I hope, the above-mentioned
suggestions are worthy of due consideration and if possible,
implementation.</p><p>&mdash;DR. C.H. AWALGAONKAR</p><p>See <b  >man xmodmap</b> for how to remap any key

really like to see a good, well-researched story on IP SANs, iSCSI
and Linux. I've been noticing lots of activities in this area, and
it looks like Linux is playing a big role in this. I got involved
in the subject because I'm on a committee that should (supposedly)
decide on network storage strategies at our place (News
International, big corporation). There are a couple of small
companies already offering iSCSI targets, and all of them appear to
be Linux-based. See for instance
<a href="http://www.pyxtechnologies.com" target="_self">www.pyxtechnologies.com</a>

<a href="http://technomagesinc.com" target="_self">technomagesinc.com</a>.

proposition, and ads pay for the magazine. As long as they don't
flagrantly violate good taste, magazines should run whatever ads
are proffered. Microsoft is probably astute enough to understand it
