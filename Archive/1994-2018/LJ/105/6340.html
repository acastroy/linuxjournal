    Adam explains the many benefits and uses of screen.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x13224a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Screen is a terminal multiplexer that
allows you to manage many processes through one physical terminal.
Each process gets its own virtual window, and you can bounce
between virtual windows interacting with each process. The
processes managed by screen continue to run when their window is
not active.
</p><p>Thus far, the screen features described aren't all that
exciting or new. In fact, there already are X11 terminal
applications that provide this functionality (konsole and
multi-gnome-terminal). What differentiates screen from the others
are some of the core features screen provides.</p><p>Screen offers the ability to detach from a session and then
attach to it at a later time. When detached from a session, the
processes screen is managing continue to run. You can then
re-attach to the session at a later time, and your terminals are
still there, the way you left them.</p><p>Screen also maintains individual, searchable scrollback
buffers for each of the windows it manages. You can perform
traditional &ldquo;enter the search term and I'll find it for you&rdquo;
searches as well as incremental searches. This is such an obvious
feature, it's surprising that more terminal emulators do not offer
it.</p><p>Other notable features of screen are configurable key
bindings, utf8 and multibyte charset support, multi-attach,
configurable input and output translation, input and output filter,
multi-user support with access control lists (ACLs) and
logging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1322710"></a>Interacting with Screen</h2></div></div><p>Before actually running screen, it's important to understand
how to interact with it. Screen sends all entered text to the
current window, with the exception of the command character. The
default command character is Ctrl-A (press the Ctrl and the A key
at the same time). The screen man page uses C-, Emacs style, to
mean Ctrl-.</p><p>The command character is used to notify screen that you'd
like to control screen itself, rather than the application in the
current window. The key pressed after the command character
designates which screen command you would like to perform.</p><p>Some of the more useful commands and their key bindings are
shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="6340t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Commands and Their Key
Bindings</a></p><p>For many of the commonly used commands, the control version
of the key is also bound to the command. An example of this is
Ctrl-A C and Ctrl-A Ctrl-C to create a window.</p><p>To send Ctrl-A to an application without screen intercepting
it, you can press Ctrl-A A. The command character can be changed to
an alternate key if you wish. Typically Emacs users change the
command character to Ctrl-B by adding <b  >escape Bb</b>
to their .screenrc. The following examples use Ctrl-A because that
is the default.</p><p>As you might expect, .screenrc is the per-user configuration
file in your home directory, and /etc/screenrc is the system-wide
configuration file that applies to all users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1322ad8"></a>Window Basics</h2></div></div><p>Now that you understand the fundamentals of interacting with
screen, we can step through screen fundamentals using a typical
screen session as an example. Probably the most typical use of
screen is to control terminals on a remote machine on which you
have a shell login.</p><p>So, for those of you playing along at home, log in to a
remote host that has screen installed. If you don't have a remote
host to <b  >ssh</b> to, you can install screen and
<b  >ssh</b> to localhost. Packages for screen are
available for most distributions.</p><p>You're now sitting at the shell prompt on the remote machine.
Type <b  >screen</b> at the prompt. You should see a
splash screen showing some information explaining that screen is
under the GPL, where to report bugs and so on. You can press the
spacebar to bypass this screen (you can disable this splash screen
permanently with <b  >startup_message off</b> in your
.screenrc). Next, you should arrive at another shell prompt, this
one running inside of screen.</p><p>The new shell running inside of screen should behave like
your first shell would. If you do a <b  >printenv</b>,
you may notice a few new environment variables set. Screen sets
TERM to screen&mdash;each screen window provides its own
vt100-compatible virtual terminal. The variable WINDOW is set to
the virtual window number, and the variable STY is set to your
session name. I'll explain more about those last two later.</p><p>So far, this single shell works exactly like you're used to
working on a remote machine. For the sake of this example, say we
are downloading the current version of screen (as of this writing,
screen 3.9.13) from the screen distribution site at
<a href="ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/screen" target="_self">ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/screen</a>.
While this file is downloading, you decide to use your spare time
to clean up your home directory. If you weren't using screen, you'd
have to open another xterm and <b  >ssh</b> to the remote
machine. With screen, a simple Ctrl-A C will create a new screen
window with a new shell process.</p><p>Thus far, you have an FTP client and a shell busily tidying
up your home directory. You can check on your download in the
original FTP window by using Ctrl-A P to go to the previous window.
You can get back to your shell with Ctrl-A N.</p><p>When you check on your download, it's not finished (screen
doesn't take that long to download, but we'll pretend it does for
this demonstration). Time to get back to your messy home directory,
right? Before doing that, press Ctrl-A Shift-M to monitor the
current window for output. Now screen will notify you when there is
activity in the FTP window. Bouncing between windows to check on
your download's progress is no longer necessary. This also works in
the inverse case; use Ctrl-A _ to monitor for silence (30 seconds
by default). Monitoring for silence is useful for long compile jobs
or other things that spew information.</p><p>You can continue to spawn new shells and do things in
parallel on the remote machine. After you open a few windows, it
becomes difficult to keep track of which window is where. This is
where the windowlist comes in to play. Press Ctrl-A &ldquo;, and you will
be presented with a list of the current open windows. Navigate the
list with the J and K keys. Pressing Enter on an entry will make it
the current window. By default, the window name isn't all that
descriptive. You can remedy this by setting the window name
yourself with Ctrl-A Shift-A. You can set these titles
automatically, much as you would set titles in an xterm, by sending
Esc-K, then the title, then Esc-\. Most likely you can adapt a
shell-specific recipe for setting the xterm titlebar to the screen
window name using the mentioned escape sequences.</p><p>To finish up our basic run-through of windowing, let's close
your existing windows. If you exit the shell that screen has
spawned, the window is deleted automatically. You can delete a
window manually with the kill command (default Ctrl-A K). When you
exit all of the screen windows, screen exits. You also can tell
screen to exit and kill all of your windows by issuing the quit
command (Ctrl-A \).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1323108"></a>Sessions</h2></div></div><p>Now that you're creating new windows and bouncing around
between them, you can get many things going in parallel. You could
potentially have some editors, an IRC client and a few other things
all running in their own windows. But occasionally disaster
strikes, and your network connection dies (those of you still
playing along at home can kill your SSH client). It looks like it's
time to pick up the pieces and relaunch all of your applications on
the remote machine, right? Not with screen.</p><p>Each time you start up screen without arguments, it creates a
new session. This spawns two processes: a terminal management
process and a client process. The client process automatically is
&ldquo;attached&rdquo; to the terminal management process. When you type, the
characters you enter go to the client, which sends them to the
terminal management process, which then sends them to your
application.</p><p>When your network connection dies, the client catches the
signal and detaches from the terminal management process. The
terminal management process continues along managing your terminals
as if nothing happened. When you log back in, you can list running
sessions by issuing <b  >screen -ls</b> at the prompt. It
should show something similar to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
There are screens on:
        24319.pts-9.hostname (Detached)
1 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-youruserid.
</pre><p>This shows that your session automatically detached when your
connection dropped.
</p><p>You can re-attach to the session in a few ways. You can give
a session name explicitly with <b  >screen -r
<i><tt>sessionname</tt></i></b>. You can tell it
to re-attach if possible, otherwise start a new session by running
<b  >screen -R</b>. Or you can go the &ldquo;do whatever is
needed to get a screen session&rdquo; route and run <b  >screen -D
-RR</b>. This last option will detach already-attached
clients and attach to the first session listed.</p><p>When you run one of these commands, you should be right where
you left off before your network connection went down. When you're
re-attached, you can continue working as if nothing ever
happened.</p><p>It is also possible to attach to a session multiple times.
This is useful if you haven't closed your screen session from
another machine, or if you simply want to display windows from the
same session side by side. You can multi-attach by adding an
<b  >-x</b> in the command-line options to screen when
attaching.</p><p>Finally, when the end of the day rolls around and it's time
to go home, you can detach from your session using Ctrl-A D. When
you return the next day, you can re-attach, and you will be back
where you left off.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x13236e0"></a>Copy and Paste/Scrollback Mode</h2></div></div><p>One of the key features listed in the beginning of the
article was screen's searchable scrollback. This is a feature I
could not live without. It's not immediately obvious to the new
screen user, but screen's scrollback is accessed via the copy
command. (You can enter copy mode with Ctrl-A [ or via the
<b  >copy</b> command.) Navigation works as expected with
either the Arrow keys and Page Up/Down or the vi motion
equivalents. Searching is accessed via either / and ? for vi-style
search or Ctrl-S and Ctrl-R for incremental search.
Case-insensitive search can be turned on with the screen command
<b  >ignorecase yes</b>. If you are using copy mode for
scrollback only, it can be exited at any time with the Esc
key.</p><p>To copy text, maneuver the cursor to the beginning of the
desired text, and press the spacebar to mark it. Then position the
cursor over the end of the text you'd like and press the spacebar
again to mark it. When you mark the end, the text is copied into
screen's internal copy buffer, and copy mode is exited. You can
paste the text in your copy buffer into the active window with
Ctrl-A ].</p><p>The final thing you should know about the copy and paste mode
is the scrollback buffer is limited to 100 lines by default. This
is, in my opinion, not enough. You can tweak this to a higher value
(1,024 for example) by adding the command <b  >defscrollback
1024</b> to your .screenrc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x13239a0"></a>Opening Windows with screenrc</h2></div></div><p>I have already mentioned that you can add a command to your
.screenrc to change the behavior of screen. It's not immediately
obvious, but you can put any screen command in a screenrc. This is
very useful and can be used to spawn windows automatically with the
<b  >screen</b> command.</p><p>A typical application of this tidbit of knowledge is to
launch a predefined set of windows at screen startup. Below is a
sample screenrc that will do so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# read in your normal screenrc
# before anything else
source $HOME/.screenrc
# now start opening windows
screen top
# it's possible to set the window title with
# the -t option
screen -t irc epic
# you can also specify the window number
# to launch in
screen -t mail 8 mutt
screen -t daemon 9 tail -f /var/log/daemon.log
</pre><p>If you save this to $HOME/.screenrc.multiwin you can tell
screen to use it instead of your normal .screenrc by running
<b  >screen -c $HOME/.screenrc.multiwin</b>.
</p><p>You also can launch more systems-oriented screen sessions
from a startup script. A common application of a system screen
session is a serial console server. Screen is well suited for this
task because it has built-in support for serial terminals and
logging. A commented example of a screenrc for this purpose
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# This assumes that serialuser has proper
# permissions to access the serial ports and to
# write to the log files specified in the screenrc.
# turn logging on for all windows
deflog on
# tell screen to log to /var/log/serial.$WINDOW
logfile /var/log/serial.%n
# open windows on the serial ports
screen /dev/ttyS0 38400
screen /dev/ttyS1 19200
</pre><p>If you saved this file in /etc/screenrc.serial, you could
launch it at startup with a script that runs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
su serialuser -c \
'screen -dmS serial -c /etc/screenrc.serial'
</pre>


The <b  >-dmS serial</b> options tell screen to launch
the session in detached mode and name the session &ldquo;serial&rdquo;. User
serialuser can log in and attach to this session exactly like any
other normal screen session. Launching a detached screen also can
be used to start screen from a cron job if this is preferred.
</p><p>It is possible to set up a single system-wide screenrc that
allows multiple users to connect to it. Screen supports multi-user
mode with per-window ACLs that define what each user can and cannot
do. Multi-user screen sessions, however, require that screen be
setuid root. Because of this requirement, I am not going to include
examples for multi-user screen sessions in an introductory article.
If you would like to set up a multi-user screen session, read the
screen docs, put on your &ldquo;adding setuid root permissions to a
complex piece of code&rdquo; paranoia hat and be prepared to lock things
down as tightly as possible.</p><p>As a third application, you could merge the two previous
examples and launch system-wide interactive programs via screenrc.
A good use of this would be launching mutella, a curses-based
gnutella client, at startup. With screen, you can launch this
program and connect to it on occasion to see the status, run
queries, etc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131a758"></a>Further Information</h2></div></div><p>You can find further information on screen in the screen
documentation. The documentation is provided in both man and info
format. I prefer the info format when browsing and the man page
when searching for specific things, but that's a personal
preference.</p><p>There are also a few on-line resources for screen users.
