    VPN tunnels for secure wireless and WAN connections, Part I

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c44a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the past five years or so, IPSec has
emerged as the leading standard for building encrypted virtual
private network (VPN) connections. FreeS/WAN
(<a href="http://www.freeswan.org" target="_self">www.freeswan.org</a>),
the free secure wide area network, is the most popular and one of
the most mature free implementations of IPSec, and it runs
exclusively on Linux systems. This month and next we're going to
discuss why and how to use FreeS/WAN for secure network
communications, starting with secure wireless networking.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c4608"></a>VPN Basics</h2></div></div><p>Until recently the two most common uses for VPNs were
network-to-network (site-to-site) connections and remote-access
solutions. In site-to-site connections (Figure 1), each
network/site has a VPN gateway, a VPN server that communicates to
other VPN gateways via IPSec (or other VPN protocol) tunnels. It
also acts as a router for hosts on its local network that need to
send packets to other connected VPN sites. In other words, in a
site-to-site VPN, multiple users or hosts share a single tunnel to
communicate to multiple hosts on a remote network.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6378f1.large.jpg"><img src="6378f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Site-to-Site VPN
</p></div></div><p>Remote-access VPNs, including the kind used over wireless
LANs, are slightly different. Rather than connecting an entire
network to some other network, a remote-access VPN tunnel connects
a single user or computer to a remote network (Figure 2).
Typically, the user's local VPN gateway is simply a software
application running on her local system (the remote VPN gateway is
usually a firewall or dedicated VPN device on the home
network).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6378f2.large.jpg"><img src="6378f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Wireless (Remote-Access) VPN
</p></div></div><p>Wireless local area network (LAN) VPNs are an important
subcategory of remote-access VPNs. Wireless networks are
increasingly popular due to their convenience and low cost.
However, by definition they broadcast all packets over radio waves,
so it's easy to eavesdrop on them. Network vendors made a feeble
attempt to provide wired equivalent privacy by creating the
wireless encryption standard of the same name (WEP), but weaknesses
in WEP's cryptographic implementations have rendered it prematurely
obsolete. Therefore, many organizations that use wireless LANs
leave WEP turned off. Instead they use VPN tunnels to encrypt
wireless links.</p><p>Returning to Figure 2, note that a single system can serve as
a combined VPN/wireless gateway. Figure 3 shows an equally valid
topology: the wireless and VPN gateways are separate
devices.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6378f3.large.jpg"><img src="6378f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c4d40"></a>IPSec and FreeS/WAN</h2></div></div><p>As I stated earlier, IPSec is the most popular VPN protocol.
Because it's an extension of the IP protocol, it's the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
VPN protocol of the Internet. For almost as long as IPSec has
existed, John Gilmore and the FreeS/WAN Project team have been
doing their best to promote IPSec's widespread adoption by
developing and giving away the FreeS/WAN package for Linux. For
definitive information about and the latest version of FreeS/WAN,
see their home page at
<a href="http://www.freeswan.org" target="_self">www.freeswan.org</a>.
Suffice it to say, FreeS/WAN is mature, well documented and well
supported. If you run Linux, FreeS/WAN is <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>
choice for your VPN needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c4ef8"></a>Getting and Installing FreeS/WAN</h2></div></div><p>Like Netfilter, FreeS/WAN consists of a kernel module that
does the actual work and user interfaces that are used to configure
it. Unlike Netfilter, FreeS/WAN is not included in standard Linux
kernel sources and therefore is not part of the stock kernels in
most Linux distributions. This is due to many countries' crypto
export restrictions.</p><p>Retrofitting and even recompiling your kernel might sound
like an unwieldy way to install FreeS/WAN. However, a number of
Linux distributions, including SuSE, Debian and Mandrake, have
FreeS/WAN packages that work with those distributions' stock
kernels. For users of Red Hat 7.3, RPM packages of IPSec-enabled
kernels (both binary and source) and the FreeS/WAN setup tools can
be downloaded from Steamballoon at
<a href="http://rpms.steamballoon.com/freeswan" target="_self">rpms.steamballoon.com/freeswan</a>.</p><p>Because I personally run SuSE and Red Hat the most, I'll
describe how to obtain and install FreeS/WAN for them. See the
documentation at
<a href="http://www.freeswan.org/doc.html" target="_self">www.freeswan.org/doc.html</a>
if your needs are more complex. Depending on your kernel and
distribution, you may have to compile FreeS/WAN from source, but
this is well documented on the web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c5160"></a>Installing FreeS/WAN on SuSE Systems</h2></div></div><p>If you run SuSE with a stock kernel, simply install the
package freeswan.rpm from the sec series. Make sure the kernel
version of the ipsec.o module matches that of the SuSE kernel you
run. The quick way to double-check your system's kernel version is
with the command <b  >uname -av</b>. To see the kernel
version of your not-yet-installed freeswan.rpm package, use this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ql -p ./freeswan.rpm |grep ipsec.o
</pre><p>The kernel version will be indicated by the pathname to this
file, e.g., /usr/lib/modules/2.2.18/ipv4/ipsec.o.
</p><p>If the kernel versions match up, install the package with
rpm, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uvh ./freeswan.rpm
</pre><p>Next, enable IPSec by opening /etc/rc.config and setting the
variable START_IPSEC to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.
</p><p>Now it's time to replace the sample host key (RSA signing key
pair) that was probably installed on your system by the FreeS/WAN
RPMs. (If the creation date of /etc/ipsec.secrets is earlier than
today's date, you need new keys.) The commands to do this for
FreeS/WAN versions 1.92 and higher are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv /etc/ipsec.secrets /etc/ipsec.secrets.test
ipsec newhostkey --hostname
--output /etc/ipsec.secrets --bits 2192
</pre><p>You will, of course, replace
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my.host.FQDN</em></span> with your host's fully qualified
domain name, e.g., george.wiremonkeys.org.
</p><p>For earlier versions of FreeS/WAN, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec rsasigkey --hostname <span   class="emphasis"><em>my.host.FQDN</em></span> 2192 \
&gt; /etc/ipsec.newkey
</pre><p>If you use the <b  >ipsec rsasigkey</b> command,
you'll also have to open /etc/ipsec.secrets with a text editor and
replace everything between the curly brackets ({}) with the
contents of ipsec.newkey (or whatever file to which you cat'd the
new key).
</p><p>Even though you haven't configured it yet, you may now test
FreeS/WAN by starting and querying it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/ipsec start
ipsec whack --status
</pre><p>If the second command (<b  >ipsec whack
--status</b>) returns <b  >000</b>, your FreeS/WAN
installation is working properly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x15c5948"></a>Installing FreeS/WAN on Red Hat Systems</h2></div></div><p>If you run Red Hat 7.3 with its stock kernel (version 2.4.18
as of this writing), download the appropriate IPSec-enabled kernel
package from
<a href="http://rpms.steamballoon.com/freeswan" target="_self">rpms.steamballoon.com/freeswan</a>.
You should grab the binary or source package for freeswan. Install
the kernel package first.</p><p>If you've already got a stock kernel package installed (and
it's almost certain that you do) you'll need to use the --force
option, because Steamballoon's FreeS/WAN kernel package's base name
(simply, kernel) is the same as that of the official Red Hat stock
kernel. On my Celeron-based Red Hat 7.3 system, I installed the
Steamballoon kernel package like this (all version numbers in
examples are probably obsolete already):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --force -i ./kernel-2.4.18-3ipsec.i686.rpm
</pre><p>Don't worry about forcing the install; the names of the new
kernel's image file and module directory are unique and will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> overwrite your old kernel. For example, on
my Red Hat 7.3 system, the new image file and module directory are
named /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3ipsec and /lib/modules/2.4.18-3ipsec,
respectively. Steamballon's RPM post-installation script overwrote
the boot menu entry in /boot/grub/grub.conf for my old kernel with
one for the new IPSec kernel (i.e., it removed the old kernel from
the boot menu). But after I re-added a menu entry for the old
kernel, I could choose either entry at boot time with no problem.
</p><p>After you've installed the kernel package, install the
user-space tools. On my system the command was:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i freeswan-1.97-0.i386.rpm
</pre><p>This RPM installs a startup script, /etc/init.d/ipsec, but
does not enable it. You can do so like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig --add ipsec
</pre>


Next, generate a new RSA signing key pair as described in the
previous section. You can then start and test your FreeS/WAN
installation, also described in the previous section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x19bdfb8"></a>Configuring a Wireless LAN VPN</h2></div></div><p>This month, I have enough space to cover only one common
FreeS/WAN scenario: wireless LAN tunneling, as illustrated in
Figure 2. Figure 4 shows part of the network from Figure 2, this
time with IP addresses. In this example, the wireless client system
is dynamically IP addressed. As we'll see shortly, you don't need
to know the IP addresses of all potential clients.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6378f4.large.jpg"><img src="6378f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Wireless VPN with IP Addresses
</p></div></div><p>The rest of this article depends on several important
assumptions: 1) basic network connectivity is already in place, so
wireless clients can connect to the Linux server; 2) basic packet
forwarding works&mdash;the wireless clients can reach hosts on the other
side of the wireless gateway; and 3) the gateway is not yet acting
as a firewall.</p><p>I make the third assumption strictly for expediency's sake.
Good security comes in layers, and it costs you nothing (other than
a little setup time) to restrict where incoming VPN traffic may and
may not go. Unfortunately, I can't go into much depth here; see the
&ldquo;FreeS/WAN quick start on firewalling&rdquo; HOWTO at
<a href="http://www.freeswan.org/doc.html" target="_self">www.freeswan.org/doc.html</a>
for more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x19be380"></a>Preparing ipsec.conf</h2></div></div><p>FreeS/WAN is configured via two files: /etc/ipsec.conf is its
main configuration file, and /etc/ipsec.secrets is its key
repository. Both files should have restrictive permissions; 0600 is
a safe choice. /etc/ipsec.secrets, in particular, must be carefully
protected. If you need to copy any data out of this file, say, your
host's public RSA key, copy out only the data you need into a
separate file. Never allow ipsec.secrets itself to leave your
system. We'll discuss this file in greater depth next month.</p><p>Listing 1 shows the ipsec.conf file from an example wireless
VPN client. /etc/ipsec.conf consists of three parts: basic setup
parameters (config setup); default tunnel parameters (conn
%default); and tunnel definitions (conn george-gracie in Listing 1,
where george-gracie is the name I chose for this tunnel).</p><p><a href="6378l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. /etc/ipsec.conf on a
Wireless Client</a></p><p>The default settings for the config setup section can be
safely left alone on single-interfaced systems. The most important
parameter there is interfaces. This tells FreeS/WAN which interface
to use as the local end point of IPSec tunnels. Its default, the
magic string %defaultroute, expands to
ipsec0=[<span   class="emphasis"><em>interface</em></span>] (where
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>interface</em></span>] is the network interface name
indicated in the system's default route, e.g., eth0). Similarly,
the default tunnel settings usually can be left alone.</p><p>This brings us to the heart of ipsec.conf: the tunnel
definition. In the tunnel george-gracie from Listing 1, we begin by
setting authby, which determines how the IPSec hosts authenticate
themselves to each other. The default is &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, which is short
for preshared secret. This setting allows you to define a secret
string used in a transparent challenge-response authentication
transaction. The secret itself never traverses the network, so this
isn't as sloppy an authentication method as you might think.</p><p>But that doesn't matter right now, because in Listing 1
authby is set to rsasig, so that RSA authentication is used
instead. RSA authentication isn't necessarily that much more
secure, but it's more convenient. Whereas a shared secret must be
exchanged beforehand via some secure means such as PGP e-mail or
SSH, the public keys used in RSA authentication may be exchanged
openly (or even published on a web page).</p><p>The idea of left and right is important in FreeS/WAN
configuration; they are used in parameters and commands to
designate the end points of an IPSec tunnel. Which side is which
doesn't matter, so long as you're consistent. The same host should
be right on both systems' tunnel definition, and one system should
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> reverse the right/left designations
defined on the other.</p><p>For sanity's sake, whenever one host acts as a server to
another, you're encouraged to designate that host as left. In our
example, George is acting as a server for wireless clients, so
George is left, and Gracie, a client system, is right.</p><p>The tunnel-configuration parameter left indicates the IP
address of the tunnel's left end point, George, whose IP address is
10.0.54.2. Right, of course, specifies the right end point's IP
address. In our scenario, however, Gracie and other wireless
clients have dynamic IP addresses. Instead of specifying an IP,
then, we'll use the magic string %defaultroute, which expands to
the IP address of the interface specified in the host's default
route.</p><p>The tunnel parameter leftid may seem redundant, as we just
identified the left IP address with left, but it's slightly
different. leftid and rightid specify each tunnel end point's
authentication ID. This can be an IP address, or it can be an FQDN
preceded by an @ sign. Because Gracie's IP address is dynamic,
@gracie.wiremonkeys.org is the only viable value for leftid. But in
this example, @george.wiremonkeys.org and 10.0.54.2 are
interchangeable values for rightid.</p><p>The next tunnel parameter in Listing 1 to consider is
leftsubnet. This defines which destination IPs can receive packets
from the right side, and therefore for which destinations the
right-hand end point will use the tunnel. Because Gracie and other
wireless clients will use George as their sole gateway to the
corporate LAN and to the world at large, we've set this to
0.0.0.0/0, which signifies all destinations. (There's also a
rightsubnet parameter, but you need to set both subnet parameters
only in site-to-site scenarios. In remote-access and other
client/server setups, only one or the other is needed.)</p><p>leftrsasigkey and rightrsasigkey both are required when
you've specified RSA authentication for a tunnel. The values for
these are stored in each host's ipsec.secrets file, in the line
beginning <b  >#pubkey=</b>. Alternatively, you can use
these commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec showhostkey --left
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec showhostkey --left
</pre>


The --left and --right options (which work on FreeS/WAN versions
1.9 and later) are optional but convenient. They cause the output
to take the form of a leftrsasigkey or rsasigkey statement
(respectively) that can be copied and pasted verbatim into
ipsec.conf. For example, running <b  >ipsec showhostkey
--left</b> on George would return the leftrsasigkey statement
in Listing 1. Running <b  >ipsec showhostkey --right</b>
on Gracie would return the rightrsasigkey statement. Note that
although RSA keys are long, each must occupy a single line, that
is, without line breaks.
</p><p>The last parameter in Listing 1's tunnel statement is auto,
which tells FreeS/WAN what, if anything, to do about the tunnel
when IPSec is started. A value of start causes the tunnel to be
initialized and started automatically. &ldquo;add&rdquo; causes it to be
added to the IPSec d&aelig;mon's (called pluto) connection
specification, and &ldquo;ignore&rdquo; causes the tunnel to be ignored. In
Listing 1, auto is set to start. Therefore, whenever IPSec is
started on Gracie, we want the tunnel to George to be brought up
immediately. The config setup parameters plutoload and plutostart
must be defined properly for auto to have any relevance&mdash;see the
ipsec.conf(5) man page for more information.</p><p>Okay, that's it for the client-side ipsec.conf. But what
about George? As it happens, in this scenario the configuration is
nearly the same on both sides. Listing 2 shows most of George's
/etc/ipsec.conf file.</p><p><a href="6378l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. /etc/ipsec.conf on
Gateway</a></p><p>The first difference is that unlike Gracie, George has
multiple interfaces, so it's necessary to give an explicit value to
the interfaces parameter. The interface in George's default route
faces the corporate LAN, not the wireless LAN, so a value of
%defaultroute won't work. Next, we have a new config setup
parameter, forwardcontrol. When set to yes, it tells IPSec to turn
on IP forwarding when needed and to turn it off when IPSec is shut
down.</p><p>Next, in the tunnel section itself, right is now set to %any
rather than %defaultroute (because %defaultroute would return
<span   class="emphasis"><em>George</em></span>'s local IP, not Gracie/right's). And,
auto is set to add rather than start, because George is acting as a
server; it only needs to be ready for Gracie to start the
tunnel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14cc580.0x19bee28"></a>Starting and Testing the Tunnel</h2></div></div><p>And now the moment of truth! First on George and then on
Gracie, we enter the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec setup restart
</pre><p>George will read /etc/ipsec.conf, load the george-gracie
tunnel definition into its connection setup database and wait for
connections. Gracie will do the same thing and then bring up the
tunnel. Startup messages will be logged to /var/log/messages or
/var/log/secure. If on the client system the output from
<b  >ipsec setup restart</b> ends with an &ldquo;IPsec SA
established&rdquo; message, your tunnel is up! Try pinging or otherwise
connecting to hosts on the remote network; the connection should
behave no differently from before when you brought the tunnel up.
In fact, you may want to run <b  >tcpdump</b> on your
tunnel-bound Ethernet interface to make sure that only ESP
(Encapsulating Security Payload) packets (i.e., encrypted tunnel
packets and not actual Ping, FTP packets, etc.) are being sent out.
</p><p>Next month we'll look at another VPN scenario or two and
delve deeper into the splendors of FreeS/WAN. Hopefully this was
enough to get you started down the path to secure wireless
networking!</p></div></div>
