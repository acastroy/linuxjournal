    Two fundamental steps in your programming education are to
    learn a good debugger and to understand Quicksort. Let's do
    them at the same time.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cec580.0x1de4500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sorting is one of the most common
functions performed by a computer, and Quicksort is one of the most
efficient ways to do it. This article demonstrates the usefulness
of a graphical debugger for learning how Quicksort works.
</p><p>DDD (Data Display Debugger) is a free, visual front end that
can control many popular debuggers. This article uses DDD to work
through a simple C implementation of Quicksort.</p><p>First, find a copy of DDD and install it. Binary and source
packages are available for RPM-based distributions at
<a href="http://rpmfind.net" target="_self">rpmfind.net</a>, and Debian
packages are available at
<a href="http://debian.org" target="_self">debian.org</a>. This article was
written using DDD version 3.3.1 on Red Hat 7.3. This article also
makes the following assumptions: 1) you have a GNU/Linux-enhanced
computer and it is plugged in; 2) you know basic C concepts
including arrays, loops and recursion; and 3) you have a capable C
compiler, such as GNU's GCC. Even if you don't know anything about
programming, try stepping through the code anyway. It's good for
you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cec580.0x1de4768"></a>A Simplistic Quicksort</h2></div></div><p>CAR Hoare described the Quicksort algorithm in a much-cited
1962 paper, and it is still in common use 40 years later. The
divide-and-conquer approach of Quicksort is probably where it got
the prefix quick; by segregating smaller elements from larger
elements it eliminates the need for many comparisons. In contrast,
a selection sort compares every element to every other element.
This is not to say that Quicksort is always faster or that it's the
best way to sort; it's simply cool to know. The implementation in
this article is not an optimized or extensible quicksort. It only
works on integer arrays.</p><p>This code was largely borrowed from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Practice of

the code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -ansi -o qsortof -g \
easy_qsort.c
</pre><p>The most important argument to GCC is notably -g, which adds
debugging symbols to the code.
</p><p>Try running the program to make sure everything is
kosher:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./qsortof
{ 6 12 4 18 3 27 16 15 19 }
{ 3 4 6 12 15 16 18 19 27 }
</pre><p>The first line of output is the unsorted array, the second
line is the array after running through the quicksort function.
</p><p>So how does it work? Let's turn to our new friend DDD:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ddd qsortof
</pre><p>This should bring up DDD. Close any Tips and About:Help
windows that pop up, and you should see something like Figure 1.

Figure 1. Freshly Started DDD
</p></div></div>

</p><p>It would be a good idea to turn on line numbering now. Click
the check box next to Display Source Line Numbers in the
Edit--&gt;Preferences--&gt;Source menu. Now we can add a breakpoint
and start debugging.</p><p>First, select the nothing to do line by clicking on its line
number in the margin. Then, click the Set/Delete Breakpoint at ()
button, and click the Run button in the floating command
tool.</p><p>At this point you should see a red stop sign at the line with
the breakpoint and a green arrow on the same line (the code that is
about to execute). Let's use DDD to display some inside
information.</p><p>To begin, select Data--&gt;Display Local Variables. Next,
select Data--&gt;Display Arguments, and then select
Status--&gt;Backtrace. Finally, type <b  >graph display
v[0]@n</b> into the console window, and press Enter. This
displays elements 0 through n of the v[] array (see Figure
2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6258f2.large.jpg"><img src="6258f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Break at if (n &lt;= 1)
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cec580.0x1de5268"></a>Watch the Engine Crank</h2></div></div><p>The breakpoint is set so that we don't do anything if the
array we were given contains one or less elements. Because this is
a recursive quicksort, this test is necessary to end recursion when
an array with one element is passed in (more on this later).</p><p>After this test, we pick our pivot and move it to the
beginning of the array. Click the Next button until the green arrow
points to the call to the swap function. Next continues to the next
line without descending into subroutine calls. Step would attempt
to step into other subroutines. Now, click Next once more to see
what happens.</p><p>My machine swapped the 0th and 1st elements of v[], meaning
rand() % n returned 1. If you debug this program a few times you
may notice that rand() % n always returns 1. Not very random, you
say? In this example, by commenting out the call to srand(), the
pseudo-random generator is never seeded and rand() returns
predictable results.</p><p>The chosen pivot will serve to divide numbers smaller than
itself from numbers larger than itself. The pivot was moved to v[0]
because we don't know where it should be until we examine the
entire array.</p><p>The &ldquo;partition&rdquo; loop steps through each element of the
array and compares it to the pivot (the number 12, in my case).
Last is pre-incremented, so the element at index 1 is swapped with
itself (I know it's a waste). Optimizing this algorithm is left as
an exercise for the masochistic reader. Note that you can click
Interrupt, then Run to start over at any time.</p><p>Click Next until i equals 3 and last equals 2 (watch the
Locals display in the graphical Data Window). The &ldquo;if&rdquo; test
inside the partition loop is now comparing 18 to 12. The test fails
(Next), so i is incremented (Next), and last still equals 2.</p><p>Keep Next-ing until i equals 9. My array is now { 12 6 4 3 18
27 16 15 19 }. Another click on Next and 3 is swapped with 12,
seated between the smaller numbers from the larger ones.</p><p>After restoring the pivot value to its original place, we
recurse into quicksort, sending a pointer to v[0] and telling it to
expect a three-element array (the smaller numbers). Then we recurse
into quicksort again, sending a pointer to v[4] and announcing a
five-element array (the larger numbers). Those quicksort calls
again recurse until only one-element arrays are passed into the
recursive calls. Only then will the recursive calls return&mdash;deepest
call first&mdash;until we return to the main function with a sorted
array. Whew!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cec580.0x1de55d8"></a>Handy Features</h2></div></div><p>If you get deep into recursive quicksort() calls, you'll
notice that the v[0]@n display is disabled. Adding a button makes
re-creating this display a snap. To create the button, click
Commands--&gt;Edit Buttons...--&gt;Data Buttons. Into the text
entry field, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
graph display v[0]@n // Varray
</pre><p>A button titled Varray should pop up at the top of the Data
Window. When the v[0]@n display reads (Disabled), right-click on
the display and select Undisplay. Then, click the new Varray
button. If it is still disabled, try Next-ing a few times and
clicking the button again.

It's interesting when you're deep in quicksort() calls to examine
the stack by clicking on other lines in the backtrace window. You
can see how the current calling context was reached and what the
data looked like at different points in the stack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cec580.0x1de5898"></a>Machine Code Window</h2></div></div><p>If you're really sick and twisted, try View--&gt;Machine Code
