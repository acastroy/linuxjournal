Development</h2></div></div><p>At long last, <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Dike's User-Mode
Linux</b></span> has been accepted into the 2.5 kernel tree. Now
users may invoke the Linux kernel as a user process on a running
system. Or to put it another way, users may invoke any number of
concurrent virtual Linux systems, which may be Beowulfed together
or clustered in some other way, or else used for testing new
drivers and other invasive patches that can result in crashed
systems. No more lengthy reboots when your new toy blows up&mdash;start
another instance and keep hacking!</p><p>SGI's journaling filesystem
<span   class="bold"><b>XFS</b></span> has also been accepted into
the 2.5 tree, having finally met <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>' requirements. For a long time, XFS made some
fairly violent changes to areas of the kernel that Linus felt
really shouldn't be touched. These have been cleaned up, and the
code is in. Users desiring journaling filesystems can now choose
between ext3, ReiserFS, IBM's JFS and now XFS.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Threading scalability</b></span> has
just made a huge jump. Now you can start 100,000 threads and run
them all concurrently. This came as such a shock to kernel
developers that Linus thought he misread the announcement.
<span   class="bold"><b>Ulrich Drepper</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> have been leading this
charge, which brings threading scalability far, far above what
anyone could reasonably need on a home system. Still, as one
developer put it, if nothing else, this shows we're doing something
right.</p><p>There is currently an ongoing debate that will have a strong
impact on virtually all users. The ability to unload a given module
from the kernel may be going away. Apparently, the code to handle
<span   class="bold"><b>modules</b></span> has become too
complicated; one proposal is that this can be simplified if
modules, once loaded, are simply grafted permanently onto the
running kernel. The problem with this is the ability to unload
modules is seen as a really useful feature many developers want to
keep. So far, the debate looks as though it could swing either
way.</p><p>Some new code for handling crashes has come to light. One
such is a patch to control
<span   class="bold"><b>core-dump</b></span> filenames. When a
program core-dumps, instead of simply producing a file in the
current directory called core, it can produce a file in another
directory with a name specified by the user. Another bit of code
for crash handling is <span   class="bold"><b>kksymoops</b></span>,
an OOPS handler that decodes the kernel symbols before dumping the
OOPS. Previously, OOPS output had to be run through a separate
program in order to produce data that would be meaningful to kernel
developers. With kksymoops, more and better information is
available. This makes it easier for users to report system crashes
and easier for developers to debug them.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p><p>CheckBook Tracker
<a href="http://tony.maro.net" target="_self">tony.maro.net</a></p><p>If you've been waiting for a replacement for Quicken, this
might be the ticket. I don't have Quicken, so I downloaded my bank
files as QIF, and they imported flawlessly into CheckBook Tracker.
The interface is clean, efficient and has a number of display
modes. This is probably the most intuitive checkbook I've used
recently. Requires: libXi, libXext, libX11, libm, libgtk, libgdk,
libglib, libgdk_pixbuf, libgmodule, libdl, glibc.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p><p>TypeFast
<a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~syringe/typefast.html" target="_self">homepages.ihug.co.nz/~syringe/typefast.html</a></p><p>This is a simple curses-based typing practice program. It
won't teach you to type (you already need to know how to do that),
but it will help improve your speed, using either an xterm window
or a VT. You can practice on different keyboards (QWERTY or DVORAK)
and alternate hands to give either hand more practice. Requires:
libncurses, glibc.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1506580.0x15fea80"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;January

(<a href="http://www.kaii.info" target="_self">www.kaii.info</a>) has
joined Sharp's Zaurus in the growing field of Linux-based PDAs.
Like Zaurus, Kaii will run Lineo's Embedix Plus Linux kernel v.
2.4.2, Trolltech's Qt/Embedded and Qtopia environment and
Insignia's Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Unlike Zaurus, it runs on a
160MHz Hitachi SH3 CPU (Zaurus runs on a StrongARM) and uses an
on-screen keyboard.</p><p>Kaii comes with a choice of color or monochrome 320 &times;
240 screens, up to 128MB RAM, 32MB masked ROM or Flash, USB
interface, RS-232C serial port, IrDA port, CompactFlash Type II
slot and an MMC slot.</p><p>It also comes with the Opera browser, the Hancom Mobile
Office suite and sync software for Linux desktops, OS X, Windows
and &ldquo;PIMs like Outlook&rdquo;.</p><p>Its size is 137 &times; 73 &times; 17mm or 5.39 &times; 2.87
&times; 0.67in, which is nearly identical to the Zaurus without its
keyboard exposed.</p><p>Infomart is positioning Kaii as a &ldquo;low-cost alternative

markets like India, China, Eastern Europe, Africa, etc.&rdquo; Infomart
is headquartered in India.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1506580.0x19f8698"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>Programs that use treacherous computing will continually
download new authorization rules through the Internet, and impose
those rules automatically on your work. If Microsoft, or the US
government, does not like what you said in a document you wrote,
they could post new instructions telling all computers to refuse to
let anyone read that document. Each computer would obey when it
downloads the new instructions. Your writing would be subject to
1984-style retroactive erasure.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Stallman, on why &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; computing shouldn't

famous, you have to go the mainstream route. If you want huge
success, you have to go the mainstream route. If you want worldwide
success, you have to go the mainstream route. And until we see our

practical sense in which both free and open code helped spread the
birth of the Internet. That's the decision made in architecting the
browser that reveals source. The source is constantly available.
People didn't learn HTML just by buying Tim (O'Reilly)'s books

tweaks they wanted and then bought Tim's books so they could figure
out how to do it better the next time around.</p><p>&mdash;Lawrence Lessig</p></div></div>
