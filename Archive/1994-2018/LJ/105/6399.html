ensure are always available to me remotely. I am looking to set up
these systems in a TiVo-like fashion, whereby each machine would
have two boot partitions and two root partitions. The goal is to be
able to perform maintenance operations on the primary-use
partitions via a secondary-use boot and root partition. I require
only basic functionality while in the secondary partition, namely
e2fsprogs and a DHCP-networked sshd. I intend to use LILO or Grub
and an init6 to switch between the setups. Assuming that console
access is never an option, what is the most bulletproof way to lay
out the partition tables and configuration for something like
this?</p><p>&mdash;Marc Lavergne,
<a href="mailto:mlavergne@cfl.rr.com">mlavergne@cfl.rr.com</a></p><p>You really don't need a second partition to boot in to for
updates. RPMs allow updates on the fly. In fact, the only reason
you need to reboot is to run an upgraded kernel. That being said,
the ping-pong methodology you discuss is always a good idea if you
mess something up during an upgrade. AFAIK, LILO and Grub do not
support a feature that allows you to boot an alternate partition if
the previous boot failed. You would probably need to write some
code to accomplish this. This solution, however, will not fix
system hangups or hard crashes. Truly remote systems usually need
some hardware console support.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@cwingert.qualcomm.com">cwingert@cwingert.qualcomm.com</a></p><p>It sounds as though you need a solution that doesn't require
the remote user's assistance. Otherwise, I would recommend a
bootable CD; some, like Gentoo, even include SSH
functionality.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson,
<a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a></p><p>There's not really one partition table setup that would be
better than the others. The only thing that's a tad more
bulletproof is to use only four partitions so you don't use
extended partitions. That way, your entire partition table is in
the master boot record of your disk and not spread out around your
disk in a linked list. That said, it won't really make a huge
difference, unless very bad things happen to your disk.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,

company, Belkin, doesn't supply a Linux driver. I searched around
and found the Linux-WLAN driver. I tried to install it, but when I
was making the driver (<b  >make all</b>), I received
several error messages, and it wouldn't compile.</p><p>&mdash;Matt Jacobs,
<a href="mailto:mjacobs519@hotmail.com">mjacobs519@hotmail.com</a></p><p>If you want to get on the Net fast, the good news is Belkin
seems to be using the common Prism/2 chipset, like many other
vendors. Tim Miller has put together an RPM for Red Hat 7.3 and 8.0
to support Prism/2-based cards
(<a href="http://prism2.unixguru.raleigh.nc.us" target="_self">prism2.unixguru.raleigh.nc.us</a>).
If you want to build drivers from source, either because you want a
custom kernel or want to learn how it's done, work through the
Kernel HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</a>).
Make sure you have everything needed to build a &ldquo;stock&rdquo; kernel
first.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti,

in-depth how to install Snort on a system with MySQL and ACID? I
have been trying this for three weeks, but the ACID console will
not log the events.</p><p>&mdash;Colin Slevin,
<a href="mailto:Colslev@transwareplc.com">Colslev@transwareplc.com</a></p><p>You don't mention whether entries are being logged via other
means. Snort typically will log to a number of channels in its
default installation. If you aren't getting entries logged at all,
the problem is likely elsewhere. Otherwise, edit your snort.conf
file. A number of logging examples are there, and you should be
able to mimic one that suits your needs. Snort has a mailing list
whose users are very supportive. You can subscribe by visiting
<a href="http://www.snort.org/lists.html" target="_self">www.snort.org/lists.html</a>.
I recommend submitting your question there. Supply your exact
installation procedure so somebody can help you more
