Dave tries his hand at creating the perfect
template for powerful, sophisticated Bash shell scripts.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d9580.0x15d1358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I received an interesting message from Angela Kahealani with a challenge: 
&ldquo;Here's what I'd like to see in Work the Shell: a full-blown shell script
template. It should comply with all standards applicable to CLI programs. It
should handle logging, piped input, arguments, traps, tempfiles,
configuration files and so on.&rdquo;
That's an interesting idea, and it fits neatly into something I've been
talking about in the last few columns too: the difference between writing
something quick and streamlined and writing bulletproof scripts. 
So let's jump in! 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d9580.0x15d1568"></a>
Parsing Command-Line Arguments</h2></div></div><p>
The first step of any meaningful shell script is to parse the starting
arguments. There's a function built in to Bash for this, but it's
rather tricky to work with. For example: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

while getopts "ab:c" opt; do
  case $opt in
    a)  echo "-a was specified"  ;;
    b)  echo "arg given to b is $OPTARG" ;;
    c)  echo "-c was specified"  ;;
    \?) echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" &gt;&amp;2 ;;
  esac
done 

</pre>
</p><p>
This specifies that you're going to have three possible parameters: -a,
-b and -c, and that -b has an argument. Using
<tt  >getopts</tt>, they can
occur in any order and can be combined where it makes sense. For example,
<tt  >-cab arg</tt> works fine, with <tt  >arg</tt> being set as the optional
parameter for <tt  >-b</tt>. <tt  >-abc arg</tt>
wouldn't work, however,
because what appears immediately after the <tt  >b</tt> needs to be its
optional parameter. 
</p><p>
What's nice about working with <tt  >getopts</tt> is that it does all
the hard work for you&mdash;there's no need to worry about shifting twice after an
optional parameter is read and so on. If you give it bad parameters, the
&ldquo;?&rdquo;
value will be triggered, with an error output. 
</p><p>
Many programs continue to parse input after all the flags have been eaten,
and you'll need code to handle that situation too. The key variable in
this situation is <tt  >OPTIND</tt>, which contains the number of positional parameters
that <tt  >getopts</tt> has processed. The solution looks like this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
shift $((OPTIND-1)) 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now <tt  >$1</tt> is the first non-starting-flag option;
<tt  >$@</tt> is the full set of
arguments given minus all the starting flags and so on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d9580.0x15d1cf8"></a>
Logging Messages</h2></div></div><p>
Adding logging to a script actually is quite easy, if you're not going
to have a lot of instantiations running simultaneously. You could use
syslog,
but let's start with the most basic: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $logging ] ; then
  echo $(date): Status Message &gt;&gt; $logfile
fi 
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, better, here's a more succinct &ldquo;date&rdquo; format and the process ID: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo $(date '+%F %T') $$: Status Message &gt;&gt; $logfile 
</pre>
</p><p>
In the logfile itself, you'd see something like: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
2012-08-07 15:07:56 7026: Status Message 
</pre>
</p><p>
When there's a lot going on, that information will prove invaluable for
debugging and analysis. 
</p><p>
But what if you did want to use <tt  >syslog</tt> and get the script
messages in the standard system logfile? That can be done with the handy
&ldquo;logger&rdquo; program, which has surprisingly few options, none of which
you need. 
</p><p>
Instead of the echo statement above, you would simply use: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger "Status Message"
</pre>
</p><p>
Check /var/log/system.log, and you can see what has been automatically added: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
Aug  7 15:12:26 term01 taylor[7100]: status message 
</pre>
</p><p>
In fact, if you want to be really streamlined, you could have something like
this at the top of your &uuml;ber-script: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $logging ] ; then
  logger="/usr/bin/logger"
else
  logger="echo &gt;/dev/null"
fi 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now every invocation where you'd potentially log information in the
system log will either be the standard
<tt  >/usr/bin/logger</tt>
message or
<tt  >echo &gt;/dev/null</tt> message, the latter causing the information to be
discarded without being displayed or saved.

Trapping Signals</h2></div></div><p>
For most shell scripts, a quick ^C kills them and that's that. For other
scripts, however, more complicated things are going on, and it's nice to
be able to, for example, remove temp files rather than leave detritus all
over the filesystem. 
</p><p>
The key player in this instance is a program called trap, which
takes two parameters, the function (or name of the function) to invoke and
the signal or set of signals to associate with that function. 
</p><p>
Here's an interesting example: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap '{ echo "You pressed Ctrl-C" ; exit 1; }' INT 
echo "Counting, press Ctrl-C to exit"
for count in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do
    echo $count; sleep 5
done 
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run this, you'll find that the script will count from 1&ndash;10 with a
5-second delay between each digit. At any point, press Ctrl-C and the
trap is triggered; the echo statement is invoked, and the script exits with a
nonzero return code (<tt  >exit 1</tt>).
</p><p>
Sometimes you want to make the script have trap management in certain
places, but not others, in which case you can disable it at any time by
specifying a null command sequence: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap '' INT 
</pre>
</p><p>
Easy enough. The code snippet probably would appear similar to: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
trap '{ /bin/rm -f $tempfile $temp2; exit 1 }' SIGINT 
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're wondering about the last parameter, it's the signal name.
</p><p>
There are a lot of signals defined in the Linux world, and they're all
documented in the signal man page. 
</p><p>
The most interesting signals are SIGINT, for program interruptions; SIGQUIT
for a program quit request; SIGKILL, the famous &ldquo;-9&rdquo; signal that
cannot be trapped or ignored and forces an immediate shutdown; SIGALRM, which
can be used as a timer to constrain execution time; and SIGTERM, a
software-generated termination request. 
</p><p>
Let's take a closer look at SIGALRM, as it's darn useful for
situations when you're concerned that a portion of your script could
run forever. 
</p><p>
To set the timer, use trap, as usual: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap '{ echo ran out of time ; exit 1 }' SIGALRM 
</pre>
</p><p>
Then elsewhere in the script, prior to actually invoking the section
that you fear might take too long, add something like this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

(
  sleep $delay ; kill -s SIGALRM $$
)&amp; 

</pre>
</p><p>
That'll spawn a subshell that waits the specified number of seconds then
sends the SIGALRM signal to the parent process (that's what the
<tt  >$$</tt> specifies, recall). 
</p><p>
Next month, I'll continue this interesting project by showing an example
of the SIGALRM code and adding some additional smarts to the script,
including the ability to test and change its behavior based on whether
it's receiving input from the terminal (command line) or from a
redirected file/pipe.
