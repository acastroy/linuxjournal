Gumstix Waysmall Silverlode Computer</h2></div></div><p>
Gumstix specializes in tiny computers-on-modules (COMs) that end up in
the most creative places, such as on satellite multiprocessor networks,
biomimetic fish robots and polar exploration equipment. The company's
recently released Waysmall Silverlode Computer adds an extra level of
robustness to these COMs by adding the protection of an aluminum
case, enabling even more applications in commercial and industrial
vertical markets. Gumstix says that the solution, at 2.5 Watts, requires
half the power of competing solutions. The Waysmall Silverlode Computer
features an 800MHz Gumstix Overo EarthSTORM COM with a Tobi expansion
board, a 5V power supply, HDMI-to-DVI cable, USB OTG cable and an 8GB
microSD card for booting to Ubuntu. Interior support exists for connecting
sensors and actuators.

Bunpei Yorifuji's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wonderful Life of the Elements</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Two characteristics that make us geeks are our erogenous zone for
enjoyment of scientific elegance and our genetic disposition to admire
the quirky. Both tendencies will find fulfillment from Bunpei Yorifuji's
new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wonderful Life of the Elements: The Periodic Table
Personified</em></span>,
an illustrated guide to the periodic table that gives chemistry a friendly
face. In this super periodic table, Japanese artist Yorifuji brilliantly
gives every element a unique character whose properties are represented
visually: heavy elements are fat, man-made elements are robots and
noble gases sport impressive afros. Every detail is significant, from
the length of an element's beard to the clothes on its back. Readers
also learn about each element's discovery, its common uses and other
vital stats like whether it floats&mdash;or explodes&mdash;in water. Why bother
trudging through a traditional periodic table? (Though, of course, we
would and we do.) In this periodic paradise, the elements are people
too. And once you've met them, you'll never forget them.

Fixstars' M<sup  >3</sup></h2></div></div><p>
While parallel processing is the answer to the need for Big Data
applications, parallel programming is significantly more difficult
than sequential programming, and many applications fail to take full
advantage of their hardware environments. To address these issues,
Fixstars created the new M<sup  >3</sup>
(&ldquo;M-cubed&rdquo;) software development
platform for accelerated processing and efficient programming in
multicore, multinode and multi-architecture environments. Fixstars
says that applications, such as image processing and simulation libraries,
are optimized for several different types of hardware and built on an
easy-to-use parallel framework, allowing for efficient development of
fast, highly portable applications. M<sup  >3</sup> offers customized solutions for
key industries in which simulations and image processing functions demand
an enormous volume of computational calculations, such as CG rendering,
computer vision and financial simulation.

DVEO's MultiStreamer DIG/IP (Micro) Encoder</h2></div></div><p>
Most customers will use the new MultiStreamer DIG/IP (Micro) Encoder
appliance in the field to gather news video and stream it live to the
TV station, says maker DVEO, the broadcast division of Computer Modules,
Inc. Other applications for &ldquo;the Micro&rdquo; include sending video of live
events and concerts, sporting events, corporate training and religious
services to iPads, iPhones, OTT televisions and other portable devices
via IP. This small, portable, Linux-based appliance weighs a mere five
pounds (2.27kg). The Micro accepts uncompressed SDI or HD-SDI video
(or optional HDMI or analog) from cameras, editing systems or video
servers, and supports simultaneous IP input. It further creates multiple,
simultaneous high, medium and low bitrate IP streams, which can be
provided with most industry-standard protocols, including UDP, RTP
or IGMP, and wrappers, such as HLS, RTMP, RTSP and so on.

Fabric Engine's Creation Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The crew at Fabric Engine built the new open-source Creation
Platform&mdash;a framework for building custom, high-performance graphics
applications&mdash;because they found off-the-shelf DCC applications not flexible enough for
studios' needs. By providing the major building blocks for tool creation,
says Fabric Engine, Creation Platform allows developers to spend less time
building back-end architectures and more time building critical workflows
and high-performance functionality into their tools. Fabric Engine took
this approach in response to the rise of performance-hungry applications
like simulation and virtual production. Because existing solutions are
not keeping pace, says the company, studios have had little choice until
now but to build from scratch to fulfill their creative requirements&mdash;something that is outside their core business. Key features of the
Creation Platform include the Fabric Core Execution Engine for exceptional
performance out of both CPUs and GPUs, modularity, extensibility and
accessibility. Most Creation applications are built using Python and Qt.

Attensa StreamServer</h2></div></div><p>
The key selling point for the Attensa StreamServer, now in version 5.1,
is to &ldquo;meet the demands of people in the Digital Age&rdquo;, focusing on
the information that matters and ignoring the rest. This enterprise
application delivers personally relevant information&mdash;no matter
where it is&mdash;to busy professionals instead of making them look for
it. The result, says Attensa, are people who are empowered to do their
jobs smarter and faster than ever before. Features added in the new v5.1
include group newsletters, improved search and filtering, the ability
to subscribe to library collections (that is, topical collections that span
multiple sources), improved workflow and numerous improvements and fixes.

Eric Giguere, John Mongan and Noah Suojanen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Interviews
Exposed</em></span>, 3rd ed.
(Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
Job hunting sucks&mdash;big time. If you can master the psychology, however,
you can keep your confidence up and land a rockin' new gig. Helpful
to this task is the new 3rd edition of the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Interviews
Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job</em></span>, a job-search guide targeted
at the specific needs of programmers. In this book, authors Eric Giguere,
John Mongan and Noah Suojanen offer up a combination of tried-and-true
advice and coverage of the latest trends. Like its earlier editions,
this guide covers what software companies and IT departments want their
programmers to know and includes a plethora of helpful hints that help
boost confidence. This third edition adds new code examples, information
on the latest programming languages, new chapters on sorting and design
patterns, tips on using LinkedIn and a downloadable app to help prepare
applicants for job interviews.
