This article is a basic introduction to program execution
stacks and how they become corrupted, and it discusses a means of detecting
such corruption. GCC provides a compile-time solution for stack
corruption detection and a set of protection
mechanisms available through an additional GCC plugin.

The Canary, or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Serinus canaria</em></span>, is a species of bird
that was bred for
captivity as early as the 17th century. These tiny and colorful (Tweety-bird-esque) birds are well known for domestication and
singing abilities (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Canary" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Canary</a>). To their dismay,
however, these little feathered-friends often
found themselves victims, acting as primitive detectors of methane, carbon
monoxide and other toxic gases that lurk in the dark depths of coal mines
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sentinels" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sentinels</a>).
</p><p>
Like their sacrificial brethren, a stack canary lies within the dark depths of a
stack frame during execution time of a program. When a function is executed,
the canary (also known as cookie, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reverse_Engineering/Common_Solutions" target="_self">en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reverse_Engineering/Common_Solutions</a>) is placed on the stack, and just before
the function returns, it checks to ensure that the canary value has not been
modified. If the canary value appears to have been modified (for example, the canary
has been stepped on, crushed, slaughtered and so on), the program can terminate
prematurely, such as with an <tt  >abort()</tt>. Such a death of our digital fowl suggests
that the stack has been modified/corrupted. A premature program
termination&mdash;for example, <tt  >abort()</tt>&mdash;prevents the executable from acting on a corrupted stack, which
could be the result of bad programming or a sign of an intentional buffer
overflow from a user of malicious intent (getting own3d). If the program did
continue and operate on a corrupted stack, it might crash, execute shell code or
continue executing but operating on bad data. The latter case of continuing to
execute without apparent fault is often difficult to debug. 
</p><p>
Personally, I am
of the belief that it is best for a program to crash or terminate early,
rather than be misleading and produce invalid output. In this article, I pay
homage to the feathered martyrs and investigate the stack protector mechanism in
GCC, as well as look at a few other implementations presented in SatanicCanary,
a GCC plugin that instruments a polymorphic stack canary&mdash;a canary on 'roids.

Stacks, Flapjacks and Hungry Canaries</h2></div></div><p>
When functions are called during the runtime of a binary, the data for each
function exists on the program's stack. The stack grows or shrinks based on the
function being executed. And, as I am sure you are aware, a function can call
other functions, which can call other functions, and so on and on. And a
function can, of course, be recursive and call itself. Well, this path from
function caller to callee is termed a call-graph. How, at runtime, is a
function to know to whom to return control? This caller-to-callee path can be
envisioned as a stack data structure. And, in fact, this stack of function call
data, stack frames, resides in the process' stack segment of memory. I am sure
most computer science students have regurgitated the vision of a stack
being a series of pancakes or as a tower of plates at a buffet. Well, on this
stack is the return address and the arguments to the caller, as well as local
variables (automatic variables) for the function being called. The stack grows
as a function calls a function, which calls another function and so on.
When the callee finishes its work, it pops the stack, and the caller is returned
control. As you can probably imagine, the stack frame holds quite a bit of
program
integrity. 
</p><p>
If a frame is compromised, the return address, where the callee
jumps back into the caller function, can be overridden. Because the memory area
of a stack in the typical x86 calling convention is marked as executable,
arbitrary code can be written to execute in place of the return address.
This is a stack-smash or stack-overflow&mdash;whatever you want to call it. These
can be intentional (exploit and shell code) or accidental (bad programming).
Either way, protecting the stack from these vulnerabilities is key for assuring
stack sanity and program safety.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122f580.0x1327828"></a>
Stack Frames and Calling Conventions</h2></div></div><p>
As I suggested previously, there is a bit of black magic that occurs when a
program runs and calls functions&mdash;mainly, the magic of returning to the
call site in the caller function, so that the program can continue on. Well, the
magic is pretty simple: a program operates on a stack of call frames, also
known
as stack frames. These frames are pushed onto the program's stack memory
segment each time a function is called. When the function completes, it pops
the data consisting of the frame off the stack, and the caller gets control
back, by jumping to the return address that was pushed onto the stack as the
frame was being constructed.
</p><p>
In this article, I focus on a simple x86 C calling convention, cdecl,
but other architectures can provide a playground for other calling conventions.
For instance, if the CPU has more registers, arguments to that function can be
passed in registers that make their data immediately available to the caller,
rather than pushing and popping arguments from the stack. Further,
a calling convention also can vary for different languages. The compiler is
responsible for actually generating the function calls and doing all of that
magic; thus, how a function is called is based on what the compiler decides to
do. In addition, a compiler can optimize away arguments and use various
hardware features of the underlying architecture to accomplish a function call.
</p><p>
In fact, GCC employs a variety of calling conventions. For a 64-bit Intel x86
architecture, the compiler will pass arguments by using registers instead of
pushing to the stack, &agrave; la the System V AMD64 ABI. This is similar to the
non-standardized &ldquo;fastcall&rdquo; calling convention. The 32-bit version of GCC for
x86 uses a fastcall convention. The intricacies of these various
conventions do not matter for our purposes here. Rather, the important piece to
remember is a calling convention is a means of how a function is called, how the
arguments are passed to it and how that callee function returns back to the
caller.
</p><p>
The simple cdecl x86 calling convention places all return values from a function
into the EAX/RAX register (32- or 64-bit, respectively). If you really want to
explore other calling conventions, Wikipedia has some great articles
explaining various calling conventions in more depth (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention</a>).
</p><p>
It's probably easier to imagine a stack frame if I provide an example. Here
goes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z = bar(x, y);
    return x + y + z;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's assume that the program is compiled using the cdecl calling convention on
an x86 architecture and is executing the &ldquo;foo&rdquo; function. In
this case, the
current frame on top of the stack is foo. Below the
foo frame is foo's
caller. And it's turtles all the way down, until the stack hits main's frame.
Anyway, foo's frame consists of both its parameters and local variables, and
it looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bottom-of-stack --&gt; [y, x, RIP, caller's stack base pointer, z]
</pre>
</p><p>
RIP is the instruction pointer register, and it points to the next instruction to
be executed; therefore, that value is pushed onto the stack when a function is
called, and that value will be the return point when the callee returns. Thus,
if the stack is never corrupted, the return address will be valid.
There are two more registers to be concerned with, the RBP and RSP (EBP and ESP
on 32-bit x86 architectures). The former is the stack base pointer, and
it represents the start of a new stack frame. RSP is the top of the stack.
Because
the x86 stack grows downward, meaning that as things are pushed onto it, the
address those things live at approaches the address of zero. So, the RSP 
always should be at an address smaller than RBP. When the function being called has
been jumped to, the first thing that function (the callee) does is sets up the
RBP and RSP. It saves the previous stack frame base pointer by pushing it on
the stack (the caller's stack base pointer in the example above). The RBP is
then updated to reflect the current frame, so it sets the current top of the
stack to the base pointer. And the stack is then increased to hold the local
variables. To increase the stack, the function
<span   class="emphasis"><em>subtracts</em></span> from the base pointer
(remember the stack grows downward toward zero). So the range from RBP to RSP
contains the address of the previous frame's base pointer and the current
function's local variables. By adding an offset to the function's current base
pointer, it can access any arguments passed to it. See <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/win32-callconv-asm.html" target="_self">unixwiz.net/techtips/win32-callconv-asm.html</a> for more
detail and lovely pictures. 
</p><p>
Returning to our example, when the calling function calls
foo, the cdecl
convention first will push the arguments given to foo, such as
<tt  >foo(666, 667)</tt>
from right to left. The construction of the frame begins with 667 and 666, with
666 on the top. Then, foo is called. By calling foo, via a
&ldquo;call&rdquo;
instruction, the return address where foo is to return to is pushed on the
stack. This address is actually that of the RIP, since it points to the next
instruction to execute, which just happens to be where foo will return control
to. The RIP then is magically changed (a call instruction also jumps to the
address of foo), and the foo function begins to execute. Because foo now
has control, the first thing it does is sets up its stack frame. To do this,
foo pushes the base pointer and grows the stack enough for any local variables
(in this case z). Inside foo, the stack now looks like this, where top is the stack
pointer and points to the top of the stack, z:

<pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt; top [z, base pointer, call return, 666, 667]
</pre>
</p><p>
The following is assembly output (from gdb) showing the stack frame
for the example function above, &ldquo;foo&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">

0x00000000004004a7 &lt;+0&gt;:  push   %rbp
0x00000000004004a8 &lt;+1&gt;:  mov    %rsp,%rbp
0x00000000004004ab &lt;+4&gt;:  sub    $0x18,%rsp

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the first line saves the caller's base-stack pointer by pushing it
on top of the stack. Next, the top of the caller's stack is set to the
bottom/base of foo's stack frame. Then, the stack frame is increased by 0x18
(24) bytes, which is enough room to hold the local variables. This can
hold three
words, or more than enough to hold the three four-byte local variables x, y, z.
</p><p>
Why does this stack frame concern us? Well, the point of return (the RIP that
was pushed onto the stack during the function
call) is on that puppy. If
somehow the stack is flooded with data, it is possible to overwrite the RIP and
the function will jump to a bad address or possibly to the address of input
data. This input data might be data passed from the user, as program input, and
it might contain code that can do some pretty devious things (such as shell
code). If
the program is, say, a server and running under root privileges, any malicious
user might be able to pass instructions as user input data to the
server. The
server might have a poorly written function that then might become victim of
the user input data. If the data was formatted properly and of the right
length, the RIP can be overridden, and instead of returning to the proper
caller, the user can gain control. Consider the case where the evil user passes
code as input, and this code (shell code) contains instructions to spawn another
shell (for example, bash). Well, because in our scenario the d&aelig;mon, server, program,
whatever, is running with root privileges, any commands it executes (even if
they were from an angry prepubescent user who hates his daddy) will get executed
as root; thus, the emo-black-hat user can gain a shell with root privileges.
Crikey!
</p><p>
This is when our little buddy comes into play. The whole purpose of a stack
canary (also known as a cookie) is to sit its feathered little butt on the
stack
and look pretty. If the canary remains intact from function start to function
return (prologue to epilogue), chances are the stack was never overwritten by
information, the return address is sane, and it has not been compromised by
error or malicious intent. See, we like canaries, they are our friends.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122f580.0x1328220"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Serinus canaria digitalus</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
The basic idea of the canary is to be a
sacrificial beast sitting within the stack frame, and if this canary value is
ever modified, that's a sign that the stack has been corrupted. There are
a variety of these little sacrificial creatures. The first is the basic, static
value canary. These are the easiest to implement from a compiler perspective
and probably the easiest to defeat. When the compiler inserts code to summon
the canary data into the stack frame, which will occur at runtime during
function prologue as the stack frame is being constructed, the value inserted
is constant. This makes checking the value upon function epilogue/return quite
easy. Because the compiler inserts a known value at compile time, the
checking routine just checks the canary data to see if it matches. Of course,
if malware authors know what this value is, they can 
craft their exploit code carefully to overwrite the RIP and the canary. A disassemble of
the program will reveal the canary value.
</p><p>
Another type of canary is the terminator canary
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>shudders</em></span>). This canary is just
a value containing a NULL or some other control character typically used for
terminating a string (<a href="https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/coding/310-BSI.html" target="_self">https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/coding/310-BSI.html</a>).
Such a canary forces malware authors to insert a
termination character into their malware source code. This means if one of
the string manipulation functions (such as strcpy or strcat) is being used to trigger
the stack overflow (corruption), it also might terminate the malware shell
code
prematurely, preventing the corruption from compromising the return address.
</p><p>
Random canaries are another species. These values can be decided upon at either
compile or runtime. If the compiler chooses a random value, each function
might have a different canary value. The check code, during function
epilogue, is easy to create, because the compiler is inserting the value
during compilation, much like the static canary, except that the value changes
for each function and/or for each compilation of the program. Runtime random
canaries are more tricky to implement. The value set at prologue must somehow
be used to compare the canary against during epilogue. There are a variety of
ways to accomplish this, such as storing the random data somewhere that both the
prologue and epilogue easily can re-create.
</p><p>
XOR canaries are used to encode data (possibly random) against another piece of
data, such as the return address. These canaries can protect the return
address
directly, and if the return address and the XOR'd canary value differ, a
corruption has been detected.

Stack Protector: the GCC Species of Canary</h2></div></div><p>
A good example of a stack canary that is common and out in the wild is that
which GCC provides, the Stack Protector. This GCC feature can build canaries
and their corresponding validity check into programs via the command-line
argument <tt  >-fstack-protector</tt>. This argument guards
only certain functions, and
if <tt  >-Wstack-protector</tt> also is passed as an argument to GCC, those functions
not guarded will be noted by a compiler warning. To enable the Stack Protector
on all functions, the argument <tt  >-fstack-protector-all</tt> can be passed. The
concept
of this feature is pretty simple. Upon function prologue, a value is placed on
the stack, and
upon prologue epilogue, just before the return point, the canary value is
checked to see if it has been corrupted/changed. So, let's peek at what this
little sacrificial beast looks like. The following is the stack frame (as GDB
output) for the &ldquo;foo&rdquo; function when compiled with GCC as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

'gcc -g3 test.c -fstack-protector-all'
0x0000000000400514 &lt;+0&gt;:  push   %rbp
0x0000000000400515 &lt;+1&gt;:  mov    %rsp,%rbp
0x0000000000400518 &lt;+4&gt;:  sub    $0x20,%rsp
0x000000000040051c &lt;+8&gt;:  mov    %edi,-0x14(%rbp)
0x000000000040051f &lt;+11&gt;: mov    %esi,-0x18(%rbp)
0x0000000000400522 &lt;+14&gt;: mov    %fs:0x28,%rax
0x000000000040052b &lt;+23&gt;: mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)
0x000000000040052f &lt;+27&gt;: xor    %eax,%eax

</pre>
</p><p>
Upon function prologue, the stack frame is set up as normal; however, the
stack is increased by 0x20 (32bytes) instead of 24. This is enough stack space
to hold four one-word values (the local versions of x, y, z and a stack canary).
Of course, the neat thing about canaries is how the value is chosen. What does
the GCC species of canary look like? Well, this critter is generated at offset
+14 and +23 in the function. The word of data located at 0x28 (byte 40) from
the start of the <tt  >fs</tt> (an extra segment) of memory is snagged and copied into
the
<tt  >rax</tt> register. The FS segment is an additional x86 register used for XXXX.
This
canary value is stored 8 bytes from the base of the stack and will be verified
that it has not been changed just before the function returns.
</p><p>
Before control is returned to the caller and the stack frame popped, the
additional code injected by GCC for stack protection, the actual safety
canary mechanism, must be executed to check for any stack corruption. The
assembly dump for the case above in the epilogue of foo
looks like this:



<pre     class="programlisting">

0x0000000000400589 &lt;+58&gt;: mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rdx
0x000000000040058d &lt;+62&gt;: xor    %fs:0x28,%rdx
0x0000000000400596 &lt;+71&gt;: je     0x40059d &lt;foo+78&gt;
0x0000000000400598 &lt;+73&gt;: callq  0x400410 &lt;__stack_chk_fail@plt&gt;
0x000000000040059d &lt;+78&gt;: leaveq 
0x000000000040059e &lt;+79&gt;: retq   

</pre>
</p><p>
As the stack canary was created in the function prologue, the function epilogue
essentially operates in reverse, by pulling the canary off the stack and then
comparing it to what is 40 bytes from the start of the FS segment. If the
values are equal, the canary is unchanged, and the function returns as normal.
If the canary differs from where the value the canary was created from, 
<tt  >__stack_chk_fail</tt> is called, and the program terminates with an error message:


<pre     class="programlisting">
*** buffer overflow detected ***: ./test terminated
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >leaveq</tt> instruction cleans up the stack, performing an addition on the base
pointer restoring it to before we increased the stack size (via the subtraction
operation at the &lt;+4&gt; offset listed above). <tt  >retq</tt> then pops the next value off
the stack (the return address from the caller) and then jumps to that address.
</p><p>
Of course, the main issue with stack canaries is that they are not zero-sum when it
comes to efficiency. While the above canary is relatively cheap on processing,
it still adds a few instructions. Further, this also increases the code size of
the binary&mdash;albeit, it's a very small addition, but I felt such
&ldquo;negative&rdquo; properties
of canaries deserve some mention. The other issue with canaries is that they
are not 100% effective. If malware authors know what the value of the canary
being used in the program will be, they can craft their malware in just the
right fashion so that their code overrides the stack, but where the canary value
is, they copy the same canary value the program expects. This is not
necessarily an easy task to accomplish, but it is not impossible.
Nonetheless, stack canaries still are useful for mere corruption detection and
malware detection. Fly on good buddy, flap hard and true.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122f580.0x131f608"></a>
Birds of Another Feather</h2></div></div><p>
So, where do we go from here? Well, I decided to write my own family of stack
canaries that operate in a slightly different manner&mdash;the idea being to have
different canaries inserted into the functions of the program, somewhat of a
compile-time metamorphic effort. Further, I also wanted to create a species of
canary, a metamorphic canary, that changes each time a function is called. This
new breed is called SatanicCanary and is available as a GCC plugin, specifically
for x86 64-bit architectures (<a href="https://github.com/enferex/sataniccanary" target="_self">https://github.com/enferex/sataniccanary</a>).
</p><p>
To become fertile and produce my own flavor of canaries, I decided to create a GCC
plugin. The plugin operates toward the end of compilation during the RTL
(register transfer language) passes (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint" target="_self">gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint</a>). RTL is GCC's somewhat
architecture-independent representation of a machine. RTL code is driven against a machine
description (md) for each platform (such as ARM, x86 or MIPS). The RTL code must
match a template in the machine description for the platform being compiled. If
there is no match for the RTL code in the template, the architecture will
not produce the proper code for the RTL, and GCC will leave you with an error.
</p><p>
Now, SatanicCanary is pretty simple as a GCC RTL plugin. The main execution
function is called after the
<tt  >pro_and_epilogue</tt> RTL pass. From that
point, the plugin can look at each RTL expression that makes up the function. I
insert
the canary in the prologue, and I check the canary in the epilogue portion of the
function. It's pretty simple. The most useful snippet of code from the
SatanicCanary plugin is summarized below and shows the detection routine used to
handle inserting and checking the canary values:


<pre     class="programlisting">

for (insn=get_insns(); insn; insn=NEXT_INSN(insn))
  if (NOTE_P(insn) &amp;&amp; (NOTE_KIND(insn) == NOTE_INSN_PROLOGUE_END))
    insert_canary();
  else if (NOTE_P(insn) &amp;&amp; NOTE_KIND(insn) == NOTE_INSN_EPILOGUE_BEG)
    insert_canary_check();

</pre>
</p><p>
This is a summary of what you will find in the Git repository in the main
execution routine of the plugin. As stated, we iterate through each RTL
expression (insn) and check to see if there is a NOTE rtl expression. Notes do
not get compiled into the binary, but are just metadata used during compilation.
We look for the prologue end and epilogue begin notes and insert our canary data
as necessary. 
</p><p>
SatanicCanary provides three canaries so far, the first (basic_canary) is just
your typical random number inserted at compile time. Therefore, each function
can have a different canary value and would require the malware author to be
lucky or to know beforehand what the canary value is. Such data is not secret,
as you can disassemble the binary to find it by looking at the canary check
code just before each function returns. This does mean that each compilation of
the same binary will change, because the random numbers will (should) be different
each compile.
</p><p>
The second canary created was more or less something I was playing with,
and it is
disabled because it is totally insecure. This canary (tsc_canary) uses the
timestamp counter (TSC) value from the processor as the canary value. This will
change each time the function is called. So malware authors must be really
lucky if they want to kill this canary...right? Well, no. The check routine,
which occurs at the epilogue phase, must know this same value. By the time
the epilogue occurs, the TSC will have elapsed a few cycles or more. To get the
epilogue to compare the canary TSC value, it must have the same TSC to compare
against. Well, my solution was poor. I just called the TSC (rdtsc) instruction
and popped the low 32 bits of it onto the stack twice, figuring that the low
32 bits would change more frequently than the higher bits. This was just
blatantly stupid, and even the most amateur malware writers can defeat this
canary. Recall that I said we pushed the TSC low 32 bits twice on the
stack: once was
the canary value, and the second push was for the epilogue to check the canary
value against. To defeat this canary, just copy a string of all the same value
across the stack, and both the canary and its check will pass the comparison in
the epilogue (as long as they have the same data). This is merely an
anecdote to say that if you do place your canary check value on the stack,
encode it in some obscure way to prevent malware from easily compromising its
integrity. Oh, and there is a better way of doing this canary, but the
anecdote of the method I mentioned is important.

The third canary provided by SatanicCanary is the TSC canary, but the TSC is
XOR'd against read-only data (tscdata_canary). Because the read-only data cannot be
modified by the process, without issuing a segmentation fault, we encode our TSC
against whatever data is in the code segment of the binary. In this case, we do
store the canary (TSC value) and the check (TSC xor DATA) on the stack. Now the
TSC and TSC-xor-DATA are two different values. Yes, I just went against what I
said, and I placed a canary-check value on the stack. But it is encoded, so it
differs from the canary value; thus, a simple stack overwrite will be defeated.
This is what I would like to call a polymorphic stack canary. It changes each
time the function is called and is also encoded against data that cannot be
physically modified by the process (read-only). It does require a few ops: the
encoding of TSC-xor-DATA and the check that just xors the TSC-xor-DATA and
DATA. This should produce the TSC original canary value.
</p><p>
SatanicCanary is just a proof of concept. Work can be done to optimize it, such
as not protecting functions that do not need to be protected, like those that
do not manipulate user input.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope this expos&eacute; into the world of stack canaries was useful. I must
say that I did not by any means exhaust this area of research. I owe a lot of
kudos to the grsecurity and PaX teams for their GCC plugin for hardening the
Linux kernel. They also provide their own species of canary/cookie
(<a href="http://grsecurity.net" target="_self">grsecurity.net</a> and <a href="http://pax.grsecurity.net" target="_self">pax.grsecurity.net</a>).
The beauty of canaries is that they can be as wicked and creative as you want, but
remember this is just one means of stack protection. Non-executable stacks can
get around the malware execution from stack problem; however, just because a
stack is not executable does not mean it cannot get corrupted. Canaries help to
detect both corruption and potential malware attempts at compromise. So go
forthwith my faithful canary-loving friends, and sacrifice your sanity in the name
of binary integrity.
