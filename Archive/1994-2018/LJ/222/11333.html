The first step to contributing to a project is to know how its
build system works. Here, I cover the kernel build system and show you
how to use it to add a feature to a kernel.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b442a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One amazing thing about Linux is that the same code base is used for
a different range of computing systems, from supercomputers to very
tiny embedded devices. If you stop for a second and think about it,
Linux is probably the only OS that has a unified code base. For example,
Microsoft and Apple use different kernels for their desktop and mobile
OS versions (Windows NT/Windows CE and OS X/iOS). Two of the reasons
this is possible on Linux are that the kernel has many abstraction layers
and levels of indirection and because its build system allows for creating
highly customized kernel binary images.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel has a monolithic architecture, which means that the
whole kernel code runs in kernel space and shares the same address
space. Because of this architecture, you have to choose 
the features your kernel will include at compile time. Technically, Linux is not a pure
monolithic kernel, because it can be extended at runtime using loadable
kernel modules. To load a module, the kernel must contain all the kernel
symbols used in the module. If those symbols were not included in the
kernel at compile time, the module will not be loaded due to missing
dependencies. Modules are only a way to defer compilation (or execution)
of a specific kernel feature. Once a kernel module is loaded, it is part
of the monolithic kernel and shares the same address space of the code that
was included at kernel compile time. Even when Linux supports modules,
you still need to choose at kernel compile time most of the features
that will be built in the kernel image and the ones that will allow you to
load specific kernel modules once the kernel is executing.
</p><p>
For this reason, it is very important to be able to choose what code
you want to compile (or not) in a Linux kernel. The approach for achieving
this is using conditional compilation. There are tons of configuration
options for choosing whether a specific feature will be included. This
is translated to deciding whether a specific C file, code segment or data
structure will be included in the kernel image and its modules.
</p><p>
So, an easy and efficient way to manage all these compilation options
is needed. The infrastructure to manage this&mdash;building the kernel image
and its modules&mdash;is known as the Kernel Build System (kbuild).
</p><p>
I don't explain the kbuild infrastructure in too much detail here, because
the Linux kernel
documentation provides a good explanation (Documentation/kbuild). Instead,
I discuss the kbuild
basics and show how to use it to include your own code in a Linux
kernel tree, such as a device driver.
</p><p>
The Linux Kernel Build System has four main components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Config symbols: compilation options that can be used to compile code
conditionally in source files and to decide which objects to include in
a kernel image or its modules.
</p></li><li><p>
Kconfig files: define each config symbol and its attributes, such as
its type, description and dependencies. Programs that generate an option
menu tree (for example, <tt  >make menuconfig</tt>) read the menu entries from these files.
</p></li><li><p>
.config file: stores each config symbol's selected value. You can 
edit this file manually or use one of the many <tt  >make</tt> configuration targets, such as
menuconfig and xconfig, that call specialized programs to build a tree-like menu and automatically update (and create) the .config file for you.
</p></li><li><p>
Makefiles: normal GNU makefiles that describe the relationship between
source files and the commands needed to generate each make target, such
as kernel images and modules.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now, let's look at each of these components in more detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b44a90"></a>
Compilation Options: Configuration Symbols</h2></div></div><p>
Configuration symbols are the ones used to decide which features will be
included in the final Linux kernel image. Two kinds of symbols
are used for conditional compilation: boolean and tristate. They differ only
in the number of values that each one can take. But, this difference is
more important than it seems. Boolean symbols (not surprisingly) can take one
of two values: true or false. Tristate symbols, on the other hand, can
take three different values: yes, no or module.
</p><p>
Not everything in the kernel can be compiled as a
module. Many
features are so intrusive that you have to decide at compilation
time whether the kernel will support them. For example, you can't add
Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) or kernel preemption support to a
running kernel. So, using a boolean config symbol makes sense for those
kinds of features. Most features that can be compiled as modules also
can be added to a kernel at compile time. That's the reason tristate
symbols exist&mdash;to decide whether you want to compile a feature built-in (y),
as a module (m) or not at all (n).
</p><p>
There are other config symbol types besides these two symbols, such as
strings and hex. But, because they are not used for conditional
compilation,
I don't cover those here. Read the Linux kernel documentation
for a complete discussion of config symbols, types and uses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b44ca0"></a>
Defining Configuration Symbols: Kconfig Files</h2></div></div><p>
Configuration symbols are defined in files known as Kconfig files. Each
Kconfig file can describe an arbitrary number of symbols and can
also include (source) other Kconfig files. Compilation targets that
construct configuration menus of kernel compile options, such as
<tt  >make
menuconfig</tt>, read these files to build the tree-like structure. Every
directory in the kernel has one Kconfig that includes the Kconfig files
of its subdirectories. On top of the kernel source code directory, there is
a Kconfig file that is the root of the options tree. The menuconfig
(scripts/kconfig/mconf), gconfig (scripts/kconfig/gconf) and other
compile targets invoke programs that start at this root Kconfig and
recursively read the Kconfig files located in each subdirectory to build their
menus. Which subdirectory to visit also is defined in each Kconfig file and
also depends on the config symbol values chosen by the user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b44e00"></a>
Storing Symbol Values: .config File</h2></div></div><p>
All config symbol values are saved in a special file called
.config. Every time you want to change a kernel compile configuration,
you execute a make target, such as menuconfig or xconfig. These read the
Kconfig files to create the menus and update the config symbols' values
using the values defined in the .config file. Additionally, these tools update the
.config file with the new options you chose and also can generate one
if it didn't exist before.
</p><p>
Because the .config file is plain text, you also can change it without
needing any specialized tool. It is very convenient for saving and
restoring previous kernel compilation configurations as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b44f60"></a>
Compiling the Kernel: Makefiles</h2></div></div><p>
The last component of the kbuild system is the Makefiles. These
are used to build the kernel image and modules. Like the Kconfig
files, each subdirectory has a Makefile that compiles only the files in its
directory. The whole build is done recursively&mdash;a top Makefile
descends into
its subdirectories and executes each subdirectory's Makefile to generate the
binary objects for the files in that directory. Then, these objects are used
to generate the modules and the Linux kernel image.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b45068"></a>
Putting It All Together: Adding the Coin Driver</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know more about kbuild system basics, let's consider a practical
example&mdash;adding a device driver to a Linux kernel tree. The example driver is
for a very simple character device called coin. The driver's function is
to mimic a coin flipping and returning on each read one of two values:
head or tail. The driver has an optional feature that exposes previous
flip statistics using a special debugfs virtual file. Listing 1 shows
an example interaction with the coin device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b45170"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Coin Character Device Semantics</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost:~# cat /dev/coin
tail
root@localhost:~# cat /dev/coin
head
root@sauron:/# cat /sys/kernel/debug/coin/stats
head=6 tail=4
</pre></div><p>
To add a feature to a Linux kernel (such as the coin driver), you need
to do three things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Put the source file(s) in a place that makes sense, such as
drivers/net/wireless for Wi-Fi devices or fs for a new filesystem.
</p></li><li><p>
Update the Kconfig for the subdirectory (or subdirectories) where you put the files with
config symbols that allow you to choose to include the feature.
</p></li><li><p>
Update the Makefile for the subdirectory where you put the files, so the
build system can compile your code conditionally.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Because this driver is for a character device, put the coin.c source
file in drivers/char.
</p><p>
The next step is to give the user the option to compile the coin
driver. To do this, you need to add two configuration symbols to the
drivers/char/Kconfig file: one to choose to add the driver to the kernel
and a second to decide whether the driver statistics will be available.
</p><p>
Like most drivers, coin can be built in the kernel, included as a module
or not included at all. So, the first config symbol, called
<tt  >COIN</tt>, is of
type tristate (y/n/m). The second symbol, <tt  >COIN_STAT</tt>, is used to decide
whether you want to expose the statistics. Clearly this is a binary
decision, so the symbol type is bool (y/n). Also, it doesn't make sense
to add the coin statistics to the kernel if you choose not to include
the coin driver itself. This behavior is very common in the kernel&mdash;for
example, you can't add a block-based filesystem, such as ext3 or fat32, if
you didn't enable the block layer first. Obviously, there is some kind of
dependency between symbols, and you should model this. Fortunately, you can
describe config symbols' relationships in Kconfig files using the &ldquo;depends
on&rdquo; keyword. When, for example, the <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt> target generates the
compilation options menu tree, it hides all the options whose symbol
dependencies are not met. This is just one of many keywords available
for describing symbols in a Kconfig file. For a complete description of the
Kconfig language, refer to kbuild/kconfig-language.txt in the Linux kernel
Documentation directory.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows a segment of the drivers/char/Kconfig file with the
symbols added for the coin driver.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b45958"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

         If unsure, say N.

         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: 
         the module will be called coin.

        depends on COIN
       help
        Say Y here if you want to enable statistics about 
        the coin char device.
</pre></div><p>
So, how can you use your recently added symbols?
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, <tt  >make</tt> targets that build a tree menu with all the
compilation options use this config symbol, so you can choose what to
compile in your kernel and its modules. For example, when you execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make menuconfig
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a4c580.0x2b45cc8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the command-line utility scripts/kconfig/mconf will start and read all
the Kconfig files to build a menu-based interface. You then use these
programs to update the values of your <tt  >COIN</tt> and
<tt  >COIN_STAT</tt> compilation
options. Figure 1 shows how the menu looks when you navigate to Device
Drivers&rarr;Character devices; see how the options for the coin driver
can be set.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11333f1.large.jpg"><img src="11333f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Menu Example
</p></div></div><p>
Once you are done with the compilation option configuration, exit the
program, and if you made some changes, you will be asked to save your
new configuration. This saves the configuration options to the .config
file. For every symbol, a CONFIG_ prefix is appended in the .config
file. For example, if the symbol is of type boolean and you chose it,
in the .config file, the symbol will be saved like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_COIN_STAT=y
</pre>
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you didn't choose the symbol, it won't be set
in the .config file, and you will see something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# CONFIG_COIN_STAT is not set
</pre>
</p><p>
Tristate symbols have the same behavior as bool types when chosen or
not. But, remember that tristate also has the third option of compiling the
feature as a module. For example, you can choose to compile the COIN
driver as a module and have something like this in the .config file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_COIN=m
</pre>
</p><p>
The following is a segment of the .config file that shows the values chosen
for the coin driver symbols:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_COIN=m
CONFIG_COIN_STAT=y
</pre>
</p><p>
Here you are telling kbuild that you want to compile the coin driver as a module
and activate the flipping statistics. If you have chosen to compile
the driver built-in and without the flipping statistics, you will have
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_COIN=y
# CONFIG_COIN_STAT is not set
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have your .config file, you are ready to compile your kernel and
its modules. When you execute a compile target to compile the kernel or
the modules, it first executes a binary that reads all the Kconfig files
and .config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scripts/kconfig/conf Kconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
This binary updates (or creates) a C header file with the
values you chose for all the configuration symbols. This file is
include/generated/autoconf.h, and every gcc compile instruction includes
it, so the symbols can be used in any source file in the kernel.
</p><p>
The file is composed of thousands of #define macros that describe the
state for each symbol. Let's look at the conventions for the macros.
</p><p>
Bool symbols with the value true and tristate symbols with the value yes are
treated equally. For both of them, three macros are defined.
</p><p>
For example, the bool <tt  >CONFIG_COIN_STAT</tt> symbol with the value true and the
tristate <tt  >CONFIG_COIN</tt> symbol with the value yes will generate the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_STAT 1
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_STAT_MODULE 0
#define CONFIG_COIN_STAT 1

#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN 1
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_MODULE 0
#define CONFIG_COIN 1
</pre>
</p><p>
In the same way, bool symbols with the value false and tristate symbols with
the value no have the same semantics. For both of them, two macros are defined.
For example, the <tt  >CONFIG_COIN_STAT</tt> with the value
false and the <tt  >CONFIG_COIN</tt>
with the value no will generate the following group of macros:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_STAT 0
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_STAT_MODULE 0

#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN 0
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_MODULE 0
</pre>
</p><p>
For tristate symbols with the value module, three macros are defined. For
example, the <tt  >CONFIG_COIN</tt> with the value module will generate the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN 0
#define __enabled_CONFIG_COIN_MODULE 1
#define CONFIG_COIN_MODULE 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Curious readers probably will ask why are those
<tt  >__enabled_option</tt> 
macros needed? Wouldn't it be sufficient to have only the
<tt  >CONFIG_option</tt> and
<tt  >CONFIG_option_MODULE</tt>? And, why is
<tt  >_MODULE</tt> declared even for symbols that
are of type bool?
</p><p>
Well, the <tt  >__enabled_</tt> constants are used by three macros:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#define IS_ENABLED(option) \
        (__enabled_ ## option || __enabled_ ## option ## _MODULE)

#define IS_BUILTIN(option) __enabled_ ## option

#define IS_MODULE(option) __enabled_ ## option ## _MODULE
</pre>
</p><p>
So, the <tt  >__enabled_option</tt> and
<tt  >__enabled_option_MODULE</tt> always are defined,
even for bool symbols to make sure that this macro will work for any
configuration option.
</p><p>
The third and last step is to update the Makefiles for the subdirectories
where you put your source files, so kbuild can compile your driver if you
chose it.
</p><p>
But, how do you instruct kbuild to compile your code conditionally?
</p><p>
The kernel build system has two main tasks: creating the kernel binary
image and the kernel modules. To do that, it maintains two lists of objects:
obj-y and obj-m, respectively. The former is a list of all the objects
that will be built in the kernel image, and the latter is the list of
the objects that will be compiled as modules.
</p><p>
The configuration symbols from .config and the macros from autoconf.h
are used along with some GNU make syntax extensions to fill these
lists. Kbuild recursively enters each directory and builds the
lists adding the objects defined in each subdirectory's Makefile. For more
information about the GNU make extensions and the objects list, read
Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt.
</p><p>
For the coin driver, the only thing you need to do is add a line in
drivers/char/Makefile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obj-$(CONFIG_COIN)    += coin.o
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells kbuild to create an object from the source file coin.c and
to add it to an object list. Because <tt  >CONFIG_COIN</tt>'s value can be y or m, the
coin.o object will be added to the obj-y or obj-m list depending on the
symbol value. It then will be built in the kernel or as a module. If you
didn't choose the <tt  >CONFIG_COIN</tt> option, the symbol is undefined, and
coin.o will not be compiled at all.
</p><p>
Now you know how to include source files conditionally. The last part of
the puzzle is how to compile source code segments conditionally. This
can be done easily by using the macros defined in autoconf.h. Listing
3 shows the complete coin character device driver.

register (or not) a special debugfs file that exposes the coin-flipping
statistics to userspace.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Linux, despite being a monolithic kernel, is highly modular and
customizable. You can use the same kernel in a varied range of
devices from high-performance clusters to desktops all the way to
mobile phones. This makes the kernel a very big and complex piece of
software. But, even when the kernel has millions of lines of code, its
build system allows you to extend it with new features easily. In the past,
to have access to an operating system's source code, you had to work
for a big company and sign large NDA agreements. Nowadays, the source of
probably the most modern operating system is publicly available. You
can use it, study its internals and modify it in any creative way you
want. The best part is that you even can share your work and get feedback
from an active community.
Happy hacking!
