copies I could get and found something of real value in each one.
What I particularly appreciate, aside from the topical coverage of
the content, is the excellent distribution you use: US mail. I'm
amazed. My October issue arrived in my Auckland NZ post box on 22
September! This compares very favourably with other US magazines
which typically take over three months.</p><p>Keep it up guys, I like it!</p><p>&mdash;John
Hardcastle <a href="mailto:johnh@helec.co.nz">johnh@helec.co.nz</a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>We use ISAL: International Surface Air Lift. This
means that all the magazines for non-US destinations are sent in a
single package overseas, and from there are distributed by national
surface mail. We have found this to be highly effective&mdash;in fact,
some international subscribers receive their issues of</em></span>
<i  >Linux Journal</i> before some US
subscribers.<span   class="emphasis"><em>--Editor</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c3580.0x14bb4a8"></a>Alternate Paper</h2></div></div><p>Just read your column about the idea of printing <i  >LJ</i> on
recycled paper and use other environmentally responsible solutions.
I just wanted to tell you that I fully support this&mdash;even if it
would cost me $10 more per year.</p><p>&mdash;Christian
Perrier <a href="mailto:bubulle@bubhome.frmug.fr.net">bubulle@bubhome.frmug.fr.net</a></p><p>Yesterday I learned about the increase in
<i  >LJ</i> due to the cost of paper for printing.
David Niemi and I discussed alternative papers that could be used.
I suggested that hemp paper <span   class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> be cheaper.
David thought that you would be open to using hemp. So I contacted
the Hemp Industries Association
(<a href="mailto:thehia@aol.com">thehia@aol.com</a>) about
companies that sold hemp paper. There is also a person to contact
about hemp paper. Maybe it is cut costs and be environmentally
sound. If you want I can contact the companies and get information
about hemp paper for magazine publishing. I would probably need
info about the size, color runs, pages, etc to pass on
though.</p><p>Hopefully hemp may be a way to make <i  >LJ</i>
more cutting edge!</p><p>&mdash;Gregory J.
Pryzby <a href="mailto:gjp@sddi.com">gjp@sddi.com</a></p><p>I am very encouraged to see you considering tree-free &amp;
acid-free alternatives for <i  >LJ</i>. I would
definately be willing to pay extra money for a more environmentally
sound magazine. The pleasure I already derive from reading
<i  >Linux Journal</i> could reach nirvana like states
if I knew everything I was reading was printed on ecologically
sound hemp paper.</p><p>I've taken the liberty to pass on your e-mail address and
information about the paper alternative discussions to Paul
Stanford, founder of Tree-Free Eco Paper, based in Portland,
Oregon. I hope that you are able to come up with a solution that
makes both environmental and ecomonic sense. Paul can be reached at

Lunday <a href="mailto:robert@skunk.hemp.net">robert@skunk.hemp.net</a></p><p>P.S. A colleague of mine wanted me to tell you that she would
buy your magazine simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>because</em></span> it was
printed on hemp paper.</p><p>While I approve in principle of using hemp/straw paper for
publishing the <i  >Linux Journal</i>, the cost of the
publication is a factor for some of us. I'm living on a graduate
school stipend, and while an extra $5 here or $5 there probably
won't break me, every little bit helps. Perhaps
<i  >LJ</i> should consider student/educator rates that
would be closer to the present subscription price should the
magazine be published in the future on straw/hemp paper and general
subscription prices be forced to rise to cover costs.</p><p>Sincerely,Kenneth E.
Harker <a href="mailto:kharker@cs.utexas.edu">kharker@cs.utexas.edu</a></p><p>First of all congratulations to <i  >LJ</i>. I am
a subscriber since the early days. I also gathered all
<i  >LJ</i>. (I think that the nature of human beeing
to gather). In my case, I wouldn't mind to pay $5/year more if I
know that I spend the money for the environment.</p><p>Thank you for doing <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>Best regards,Rene von
Arx <a href="mailto:rene.von-arx@alcatel.ch">rene.von-arx@alcatel.ch</a></p><p>In your editorial dialogue with Charles Stickelman, you asked
what subscribers would think about increased cost of
<i  >LJ</i> if you switched to hemp/straw based paper
(if they became available). I would like to say that I would be
willing to pay more for such a product, and would probably be
willing to go up another $15.00 per year. If we want to become
environmentally responsible, we need to make our demands known to
the suppliers of products who have alternatives available. If we
are not willing to pay for environmentally friendly products, we
aren't in much position to gripe about other people.</p><p>&mdash;James A.
Robinson <a href="mailto:jimr@simons-rock.edu">jimr@simons-rock.edu</a></p><p>In Issue 18, you ask the question about who among us would be
willing to spend more on the magazine in order to get low-chemical
biodegradable papers and inks.</p><p>While I am far from an &ldquo;environmentalist&rdquo;, I see no point
in putting chemicals into the environment when there are perfectly
acceptable natural alternatives (e.g. Soy Ink and low-acid
paper).</p><p>In the same vein, I am no fan of drug use (even marijuana),
but given the other uses for hemp (rope, paper, etc), its high
quality in these applications, and its possible abundance, I find
it deplorable that we have such draconian laws and enforcement to
&ldquo;control&rdquo; it.</p><p>I guess you only asked about higher subscription rates for
&ldquo;environmentally-friendly&rdquo; magazines... I would be willing to pay
$3-5/yr more for the time being. I suspect that as more
publications make use of these components they will become cheaper
and we will not have to pay higher prices for long.</p><p>&mdash;Michael
George <a href="mailto:71540.164@compuserve.com">71540.164@compuserve.com</a></p><p>I'm not against the use of more environmentally friendly
printing methodologies. I am however, concerned about any
degredation in the current good quality of <i  >LJ</i> paper and
printing.</p><p>I've found that some of the newer environmentally friendly
journals are easily smudged, making them a poor choice for use as
long term reference material.</p><p>So for me, it's not an acceptable tradeoff if quality and
durability is lessened in the change. I propose that if this is the
case, we hold off on any modifications until a solution is found
that provides a gain on both these issues.</p><p>Keep up the outstanding work.</p><p>&mdash;Best regards,James

like to see an electronic version of the <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It would save paper, ink, printing costs, and
lots of trees. The only thing to figure out is how to distribute
it. You could encrypt it with the subscriber's public key, or
something like that. I am sure that something could be worked
out.</p><p>I have been surprised that publishers have not moved into the
electronic market yet. The potential for selling information is
tremendous.</p><p>The primary reason that I am interested is because I am
blind. When I get my journals, I have to find someone with the time
to read me the articles I am interested in. Since almost no one has
time, it usually involves paying someone by the hour to do this.
$5.00 per hour can get steep.</p><p>I would be willing to work with anyone who be interested in
doing this. I have a lot of ideas on security, making sure the
magazine gets to the intended subscriber, and other issues related
to electronic publishing.</p><p>I am willing to donate my time as I hope that as more things
are made usable by me, it will increase my money making potential.
I will be able to generate more income and spend less to keep up
with the &ldquo;printed&rdquo; media.</p><p>I hope someone takes a serious look at this note and that it
does not go to the great black bit bucket.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your time. I look forward to hopefully
working with some one on this.</p><p>&mdash;Kelly
Prescott <a href="mailto:kellypre@linkup.com">kellypre@linkup.com</a></p><p>Right now, we are working on distributing it via our WWW
site.</p><p>We are in the process of writing a markup language for <i  >Linux Journal</i> that is similar to HTML and will allow us to do many
different kinds of distribution, including paper, WWW, and
potentially other kinds of electronic distribution. You are not the
only blind user to have contacted us, and we would like to be able
to meet your needs better.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Controlling distribution is not a big issue. Most
