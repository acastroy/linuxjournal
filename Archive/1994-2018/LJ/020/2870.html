    A few months ago, we asked <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers to rank
    their favorite Linux-related  software, hardware and books
    during a two-week Web and e-mail-based survey. Here are your
    choices.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a348"></a></h2></div></div><p>This first year, the Readers' Choice
awards have only three broad catagories. One of the most common
requests was for us to expand our catagories significantly, which
we will consider for next year's awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a450"></a>Books</h2></div></div><p>Tied for first place were <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>,
by Matt Welsh and Lar Kaufman, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sendmail: Theory and
Practice</em></span>, by Frederick M. Avolio and Paul A. Vixie. A
close second was <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</em></span>, by
John Ousterhout.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> has sold out of several
printings, and O'Reilly has announced that they will be selling it
with a companion CDROM package containing Red Hat Commercial
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a710"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>First place in the hardware catagory was the Cyclades family
of multiport serial boards, and second place was the Comtrol family
of multiport serial boards.</p><p>Both of these vendors fully support the Linux drivers for
their products, and the Cyclades driver is part of the mainline
Linux source tree. In addition, when Cyclades released their first
PCI-based multiport serial board, they prepared the Linux driver
before drivers for any other operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2812580.0x290a870"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>First place goes to <span   class="bold"><b>Ishmail</b></span>,
a powerful mail-reading application for Linux. Tied for second were
<span   class="bold"><b>BB Tool</b></span>, a stock charting
application, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>BRU</em></span>, the Backup and Restore
Utility. Many readers wanted to vote for more than one subcatagory
of software; they considered choosing between an application and a
tool (for instance) impossible and insane. (We would like to thank
them for doing the impossible and becoming temporarily insane for
us...)</p><p>While there were obviously many readers who like Ishmail, we
suspect that one of them posted to an Ishmail mailing list about
the survey, since the majority of the votes for Ishmail came in
over a period of only a few hours. Even without those votes,
Ishmail would still have won, as well as we can tell.</p></div></div>
