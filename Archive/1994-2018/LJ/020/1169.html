    Slightly more tedious and complex than adding a disk drive
    to other microcomputer systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2af33f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The steps required to add an additional
disk drive to a microcomputer system are somewhat more tedious than
those needed for larger systems. Most of the complexity comes from
the fact that disks can be shared by distinct operating systems on
microcomputers.
</p><p>The terminology related to disk partitions varies somewhat
between UNIX and other microcomputer operating systems. For
example, DOS distinguishes between the primary partition (the
principal, bootable DOS partition) and other extended partitions on
the same hard disk; a UNIX disk partition is simply a separately
accessible portion of a disk. DOS allows for a maximum of four
physical partitions per disk. Under DOS, a physical disk partition
can be further subdivided into multiple parts, known as logical
drives. The first step in adding a disk to a microcomputer system
is to decide how the drive will be split between DOS and UNIX (if
applicable). The fdisk utility is used to create physical disk
partitions on microcomputer systems (DOS also provides an fdisk
utility). The cfdisk utility, a screen-based version of fdisk, is
also available under Linux. The following considerations apply to
the myriad of fdisk versions that you may encounter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The conventional wisdom is to use the native
version of fdisk to create and operate on the disk partitions for
each operating system. In other words, use the DOS version for the
DOS partitions, and the UNIX version for the UNIX partitions. In
practice, you can often get away with using a different version.
Things generally work fine, except when they don't.</p></li><li><p>Keep records of the partition numbers, starting and
ending blocks, total sizes, partition type, and other data for each
disk partition table as it is displayed by every version of fdisk
that you have. An easy way to do this is to print the partition
table from each version. If the table is ever damaged&mdash;and this
does happen from time to time&mdash;you will probably need the
information to recreate it and recover your data. Having the data
from all the versions ensures that you can redefine partitions
following the same alignment patterns and requirements as observed
by the various operating systems when they created the partitions
initially.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2af3710"></a>Making a New Disk Available to Linux</h2></div></div><p>We'll look at the process of attaching a new SCSI disk to a
Linux system in detail. The process would be the same for other
disk types (for example, IDE), although the special files used to
access the device would be different (for example,
/dev/hdb).</p><p>After attaching the disk to the system, it should be detected
when the system is booted. You can use the dmesg command to display
boot messages or check /etc/boot.log if you're using the sysvinit
facility:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scsi0 : at 0x0388 irq 10 options CAN_QUEUE=32 ...
scsi0 : Pro Audio Spectrum-16 SCSI
scsi : 1 host.
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, id 2, lun 0
scsi : detected 1 SCSI disk total.
</pre><p>If necessary, create the device special files for the disk
(needed only when you have lots of disks). For example, this
command creates the special files used to access the fifth SCSI
disk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /dev; MAKEDEV sde
</pre><p>Note also that disk ordering happens at boot time, so adding
a new SCSI disk with a lower SCSI ID than an existing disk will
cause special files to be reassigned&mdash;and probably break your
/etc/fstab setup.</p><p>Assuming we have our special files all in order, we will use
fdisk or cfdisk (a screen-oriented version) to divide the disk into
partitions (we'll be saving about a third of the disk for a DOS
partition). The following commands will start these utilities for
the first SCSI disk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# fdisk /dev/sda
# cfdisk /dev/sda
</pre><p>We'll need the following subcommands:</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2af3ad8"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Action</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Subcommand</b></span></p></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>fdisk</p></td><td><p>cfdisk</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Create new partition</p></td><td><p>n</p></td><td><p>n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Change partition type</p></td><td><p>t</p></td><td><p>t</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Make partition active/bootable</p></td><td><p>a</p></td><td><p>b</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Write partition table to disk</p></td><td><p>w</p></td><td><p>W</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Change size units</p></td><td><p>u</p></td><td><p>u</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Display partition table</p></td><td><p>p</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>cfdisk is more convenient to use as the partition table is
displayed continuously. A cfdisk subcommand always operates on the
current partition (highlighted). Thus, in order to create a new
partition, move the highlight to the line corresponding to Free
Space, and then enter an n. cfdisk will prompt for the partition
information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Primary or logical [pl]: p
Size (in MB): 110
</pre><p>If you'd rather enter the size in a different set of units,
use the u subcommand (cycles among MB, sectors and
cylinders).</p><p>We use the same procedure to create a second partition, and
then activate the first partition with the b subcommand. Then, we
use the t subcommand to change the partition types of the two
partitions. The most commonly needed type codes are 6 for DOS, 82
for a Linux swap partition, and 83 for a regular Linux
partition.</p><p>Here is the final partition table (output has been
simplified): Don't put any hairspaces in between the dashes below,
or they will blow up. They don't have to look separated.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cfdisk 0.8 BETA
              Disk Drive: /dev/sda
Heads: 16  Sectors per Track: 63   Cylinders: 1023

/dev/sda1 Boot    Primary     Linux          110.0

                  Pri/Log     Free Space       0.5
</pre><p>If you've changed the partition layout of the disk&mdash;in other
words, done anything other than change the types assigned to the
various partitions&mdash;reboot the system at this point.</p><p>Next, use the mkfs command to create a filesystem on the
Linux partition. mkfs has been streamlined in the Linux version and
requires little input:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sda1
</pre><p>This command creates an ext2-type filesystem. If you want to
customize mkfs's operation, the following options may be
useful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >-b</b>: Set filesystem block size in
bytes (the default is 1024).</p></li><li><p><b  >-f</b>: Set filesystem fragment size
in bytes (the default is 1024).</p></li><li><p><b  >-c</b>: Check the disk partition for
bad blocks before making the filesystem.</p></li><li><p><b  >-i</b>: Specify bytes/inode value:
create one inode for each chunk of this many bytes. The default
value of 4096 usually creates more than you'll ever need, but
probably isn't worth changing.</p></li><li><p><b  >-m</b>: Specify the percentage of
filesystem space to reserve (accessible only by root). The default
is 5% (half of what is typical on other UNIX systems). In these
days of multigigabyte disks, even this percentage may be worth
rethinking.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once the filesystem is built, run fsck:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# fsck -f -y /dev/sda1
</pre><p>The <b  >-f</b> option is necessary to force fsck
to run even though the filesystem is clean. The new filesystem may
now be mounted and entered into /etc/fstab, which is the subject of
the next section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2aec258"></a>The Filesystem Configuration File:

given kind of filesystem. For ignore type entries, this field is

A decimal number indicating the frequency with which this

utility is in alpha testing and is not available on most Linux
systems, so unless you use dump, you can ignore this field.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>pass-number</tt></i></b>:
A decimal number indicating the order in which fsck should check
the filesystems. A pass-number of 1 indicates that the filesystem
should be checked first, 2 indicates that the filesystem should be
checked second, and so on. The root filesystem must have a
pass-number of 1. All other filesystems should have the same or
higher pass numbers. For optimal performance, two filesystems that
are on the same disk drive should have different pass numbers;
however, filesystems on different drives may have the same pass
number, letting fsck check the two filesystems in parallel. fsck
will usually be fastest if all filesystems checked on the same pass
have roughly the same size. This field should be 0 for swap devices
(0 disables checking by fsck).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29fb580.0x2e00260"></a>Viewing and Modifying the Superblock</h2></div></div><p>The tune2fs command may be used to list and alter fields

the maximum time interval between checks in days, and the
<b  >-c</b> option may be used to specify the maximum
number of mounts between checks. For example, the following command
disables the time-between-checks function and sets the maximum
number of mounts to 25:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Setting maximal mount count to 25
Setting interval between check 0 seconds

Disks</h2></div></div><p>UNIX versions designed for microcomputers tend to assume that
such systems have a single disk large enough to accommodate all of
the filesystems that it will use. If what you actually have is a
smaller amount of space on each of two disks but not enough on
either one to hold all of UNIX, there is usually no built-in way to
install the operating system anyway. However, a procedure like the
following will usually be successful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Install a minimal operating system on the partition
on the first disk.</p></li><li><p>Add the partition(s) from the second disk to the
system.</p></li><li><p>The general strategy is to create symbolic links to
the partition on the second disk to allow the operating system to
be split across them. This can mean copying some directories to the
second disk after installation and then creating links in the
original location, as in this example (/d2 is the mount point for
the partition from the second disk:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /d2
# tar -cvf - -C /usr/lib terminfo | tar -xvpf -
# rm -rf /usr/lib/terminfo
# ln -s /d2/terminfo /usr/lib/terminfo
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Alternatively, if you know or can determine the
location for an operating system component before installing it,
you can pre-set up the symbolic link, then install that component,
and the files will be written to the right location to begin with.
For example, the following commands will cause the manual pages to
be written to the second disk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /d2/man
# chown bin /d2/man; chgrp bin /d2/man
# chmod 755 /d2/man
# ln -s /d2/man /usr/man
</pre></li><li><p>When selecting components to move, avoid placing
anything required to boot the system on the second disk.</p></li><li><p>Continue this process until everything you want is
installed.</p></li></ul></div><p>Reprinted with minor alterations by permission
