Talbott</p></li><li><p>Publisher: O'Reilly &amp; Associates</p></li><li><p>Pages: 481</p></li><li><p>ISBN: ISBN 1-56592-085-6</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Danny Yee</p></li></ul></div><p>At heart <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future Does Not Compute</em></span> is
an attack on the excesses of technological optimism, particularly
those associated with computers. Talbott is worried about the
identification of technology with the ends it is supposed to help
us achieve (of communication systems with community, for example)
and with what our growing reliance on technology indicates about
ourselves: he sees computers as bringing out the worst in people
and as a kind of reflection of a wider malaise. Part one is a broad
survey of the relationship between computers and human communities
(which wanders as far afield as globalization and business ethics);
part two considers the effects of computers in education; part
three is about the effects of computers on writing and language and
on the elevation of &ldquo;information&rdquo; to an end in itself; and the
final part is about the &ldquo;evolution of consciousness&rdquo;.
</p><p>I got about two thirds of the way through <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Future Does Not Compute</em></span> before giving up on it. It
wasn't its anti-technological stance which turned me off, but
rather the way Talbott went about presenting his ideas. All too
often he lapses into complete mysticism, with such outbreaks
as</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The solitary bird, gripped by an unknowing
intensity as it ploughs through the trackless ether, hears, on the
dull edges of its consciousness, a call of destiny sung by hidden
choirs.</p></blockquote></div><p>(which is defended by a counter-attack on a ridiculous
straw-man reductionism). Even where he avoids outright
obscurantism, Talbott lacks any kind of respect for philosophical
niceties. He keeps on attributing intentionality to machines, for
example, in such fashion as</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>the computer ups the ante in a game already
extremely perilous. It relentlessly, single-mindedly, apes us even
in those habits..., for it is endowed in some sense with a mind of
its own.</p></blockquote></div><p>and talks about them &ldquo;acting in their own right&rdquo;, but at
the same time refuses to allow that there is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> sense in which they can approach human
beings. For all he goes on about the &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; being present
in our &ldquo;inner selves&rdquo;, Talbott's rhetoric relies heavily on a
rigid and fundamental dichotomy between the natural and the
artificial, between man and machine. He makes no attempt at all to
justify this assumption: even the references to Searle and Penrose
I kept expecting never turned up.</p><p>Talbott has an eye for an effective phrase and an impressive
vocabulary (sometimes he verges on poetry), but this is taken to
extremes: he is always prepared to sacrifice clarity and content on
the altar of rhetoric and effect. Terms like &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; and
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; and phrases such as &ldquo;our trust as stewards of
the Earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;sleepwalking subservience to technology&rdquo; are
used without any explanation in critical contexts. Here are some
longer examples:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We must tame technology by rising above it and
reclaiming what is not mechanical in ourselves.</p></blockquote></div><p>Where, as a child, I differentiated myself from the animal,
now I must learn to differentiate myself from the machine&mdash;and
this differentiation lies in the deepening of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>consciousness</em></span>. It is therefore not only a
matter of pointing to established human nature; it is also a matter
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>realizing</em></span> human nature in its movement
toward the future. Related problems are that Talbott presents his
ideas in a rambling and disconnected fashion, in short sections
within short chapters, and that he has a tendency to say the same
thing over and over again in different ways.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future Does Not Compute</em></span> also lacks
any kind of sociological or psychological depth. The discussion of
globalization, for example, doesn't engage at all with historical
or economic perspectives on the subject, and analysis of at least
one concrete example (of a network group which claims &ldquo;community&rdquo;
status) might have given some basis to his analysis of the
relationship between technology and community; as it is, all he can
offer on these subjects are empty generalizations.</p><p>The most distressing thing about <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future Does
Not Compute</em></span> is that I actually agree with quite a lot of
what Talbott has to say, both on general subjects like education
and the evils of assuming there are technological solutions to all
human problems and on more specific ones such as profit-seeking
business ethics and naively optimistic claims by artificial
intelligence researchers. I fear, however, that many people will
use his book as another excuse to reject all discussion of some
important questions as obscurantist nonsense. In the end I
abandoned <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future Does Not Compute</em></span> because
I wasn't learning anything from it: it is emotionally stirring but
intellectually vacuous.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Disclaimer: I requested and received a review
copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future Does Not Compute</em></span> from
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, but I have no stake, financial or
otherwise, in its success.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>
