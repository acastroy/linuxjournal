    The Caldera Network Desktop fulfills its promises and hints
    at a plug-and-play system for the masses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173e3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It's slick, It's attractive! It installs
on your i486 computer with a minimum of fuss. It does everything it
says it will do, and&mdash;it's only in pre-release! (Version 1.0,
Preview 1 is the version available at the time of this writing.
[Preview 2 is now shipping from Caldera, and will be reviewed in a
later issue&mdash;ED])
</p><p>OK&mdash;back to reality. Though it looks familiar, there is
nothing quite like Caldera Network Desktop (CND). It's something
new to the Linux community. It includes a number of more-or-less
independent packages, but here's the kick: some of them are
commercial. That is, they are proprietary&mdash;you cannot redistribute
them as you can with the usual Linux software. One to a customer,
unless you get multiple-user licensing.</p><p>The manual puts it this way:</p><p>Caldera has included a Desktop metaphor, a NetWare client, a
font server, and other commercial software that runs on top of the
Linux operating system. Because Caldera has licensed these
commercial components from other companies, they cannot be freely
distributed, but are licensed on a per-copy basis.... You must have
a license for each computer which runs these programs.</p><p>Well, that's pretty clear. But just to make sure you are
informed, the manual goes to some lengths to include the GNU
General Public License, the UC Berkeley copyright, and license
terms for pthreads (technology used by the NetWare Client). This
may be Linux but it isn't (entirely) free. It's a combination of
freeware and proprietary software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173e660"></a>The Package</h2></div></div><p>Version 1.0 of the Caldera Network Desktop Preview arrived at
my doorstep via UPS from Banta ISG, in Provo Utah. The Caldera box
told me I held &ldquo;The Complete Client/Server Internet Solution;&rdquo; what
you find inside is an excellent 124-page <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting
Started</em></span> guide and one CD, which includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux 1.2.8 from Red Hat</p></li><li><p>an attractive X-window GUI</p></li><li><p>15 fonts in TrueType, Type 1 and SPEEDO
formats</p></li><li><p>a WEB browser and server</p></li><li><p>a NetWare client (for NetWare 3.x and 4.x
servers)</p></li><li><p>servers for mail and FTP</p></li></ul></div><p>I noted along the way that CND is English-only (except for
the usual Linux internationality).</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span> book was
well-organized, and contained everything I needed to know to select
a kernel and complete a Caldera Network Desktop
installation.</p><p>So which is it? Is CND to be one of those software packages
you install, but don't tinker with? It's advertised that way. Or is
it a package in the Linux tradition&mdash;install, but grab your
screwdrivers and immediately start modifying? Let's see.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173ed98"></a>Red Hat</h2></div></div><p>CND is built on top of the Red Hat Commercial Linux
distribution. Preview 1 shipped with the 1.2.8 Linux kernel. It was
compiled with IPX support and <b  >CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</b>
enabled, and allows you to disable verbose boot messages.</p><p>The standard C and X11 tools and libraries are included.
Preview 1 shipped with version libc version 4.5.26 and gcc version
2.5.8. libc version 4.6.27 is also included on the CD.</p><p>The documentation discusses some of the differences between
the Red Hat Linux file system structure and the Linux File System
Standard (FSSTND). And, as with other Linux distributions, your
starting kernel has a bunch of stuff you don't need for your
particular machine; compiling a new kernel after Caldera
installation is, as always, a Good Thing. [<i  >Linux Journal</i> covered this in issue 7, November 1994, and it
hasn't changed very much since. Just be sure to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when you
are asked about <b  >CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</b>&mdash;Ed]</p><p>On occasion during my trials of CND, I found myself eating
Flaming Death at the hands of Caldera support folks, and I was not
alone. Slackware users, it seems, should have known better than to
use that shady distribution. No matter, I say; if I came from a
non-Red Hat environment, CND's purported ease of use should have
smoothed the transition. [Preview 2 gives some of this
capability&mdash;Ed] Curiously, Caldera's Web page
(<a href="http://www.caldera.com" target="_self">http://www.caldera.com/</a>)
hints that it is possible to unbundle the Network Desktop from the
Red Hat distribution, and a few information files on the Caldera
site actually give you tips on how to do it&mdash;on top of
Slackware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173f108"></a>Networking</h2></div></div><p>CND recognizes the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Novell's IPX</p></li><li><p>Novell's NetWare 3.x, 4.x (NDS) file server access
(no printers yet).</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP/NFS, etc.</p></li><li><p>Samba 1.9.00 (an SMB server)</p></li></ul></div><p>I did not test the Samba server, but can praise the
absolutely transparent Novell and TCP/IP services. Applications and
X windows are one thing, but it's this sort of functionality that
will make Linux a contender at my own workplace.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173f580"></a>X windows</h2></div></div><p>The desktop environment, called Looking Glass, is based on
Visix's Looking Glass Professional. It runs as an application on
top of X11 and is used in conjunction with an unmodified version of
the fvwm window manager. From the CND FAQ:</p><p>There is a general purpose file typing facility for the
desktop metaphor: actions can be defined for a given file type. And
drop actions can be defined: dropping an HTML file on the browser
will launch the browser on that file.</p><p>A graphics card supporting at least 256 colors is required.
Graphics cards which are supported by XFree86 are also supported on
CND. A smooth program called Xconfigurator is also provided, which
creates an XFree86 configuration file for many popular video
cards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173f738"></a>Web Browser and Server</h2></div></div><p>The Web browser provided is Arena. It is serviceable, but
while it was being ported to Linux it acquired some color
allocation problems. While it claims HTML 3 compliance, it doesn't
support forms or e-mail.</p><p>The Web server installs and works invisibly. I found no
problems with it, but did not explore scripting capabilities, or
its performance under stress.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173f898"></a>Technical Support</h2></div></div><p>For the time being, Caldera support &ldquo;is limited (mainly via
e-mail and our WWW and FTP servers on the Internet). No individual
support is provided.&rdquo; The Caldera page at
<a href="http://www.caldera.com" target="_self">www.caldera.com</a>
included pointers to a wealth of information, including Linux in
general, Red Hat in particular, and, of course, CND FAQs and other
technical information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x173f9f8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>To make all this work you need to install it on an i386 or
i486 computer with one 3-1/2" floppy, at least 80MB of hard drive
(although the excellent &ldquo;Express&rdquo; install uses 140MB, and a
complete install seems to be at least twice that), 8MB of RAM (a
more realistic 16 MB if you plan to use X-windows), a CD drive
which the supplied Linux boot kernels will recognize, and an
appropriate net connection. With that and three blank floppies
ready for the necessary boot, root and recover disks, you're ready
to install&mdash;or are you?</p><p>The years have taught me that a single software installation
on a single hardware combination can give a ludicrous impression of
the product. Consequently, I have taken the trouble to install
Caldera on hardware including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Mitsumi and Matsushita CD (with
Soundblaster)</p></li><li><p>100MB, 130MB, 220MB and 820MB hard disk</p></li><li><p>Western Digital and Tseng VLB</p></li></ul></div><p>If this seems a waste of time, trust me; each element plays a
part in setting up a user's reaction&mdash;&ldquo;This is a hunk of junk&rdquo;,
&ldquo;this is great&rdquo;, or &ldquo;this is really strange.&rdquo;</p><p>I have performed these Caldera installations in two different
environments. The first is my place of work, where I have an
Ethernet connection to our WAN and from there, through a firewall,
to the Internet. The second is at home, where my connection to the
outside world is via the phone company and a local Internet
provider.</p><p>Something you must not ignore: Believe the documentation when
it tells you how much disk space is required. The &ldquo;express&rdquo; install
calls for not less than 140MB; anything less leaves you with an
incomplete, totally unbootable installation. Start over, with
plenty of disk space&mdash;I'd say nothing less than 220MB (cheap these
days). Because part of the point of Caldera is that nifty &ldquo;Looking
Glass&rdquo; desktop, that means lots of space is needed. You'll want
space for a swap partition, X itself, all the Caldera-specific
paraphernalia, net stuff, and so on. And you'll want to build
kernels every now and then, so you'll need gcc, the libraries, and
so on. For all this, remember to keep your video specs handy, and
to have fun. The manual has a handy table which allows you to
calculate the disk space required, or make decisions at to what
programs you can afford to skip. It's invaluable.</p><p>After your initial installation, software may be installed or
removed by means of either the Red Hat Program Package (RPP)
command-line tools, or the Linux Installation Manager (LIM) graphic
interface to RPP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x1b38170"></a>Quirks</h2></div></div><p>Some of the quirks are a result of Linux itself. During
installation, for instance, after ten minutes of disk activity, the
screen goes blank! Of course&mdash;it's only the screen blanker, what
could be more logical? But if this is your first shot at a Linux
installation, you might be tempted to do something nasty, like
reboot. (Hint: press the shift key; anything else will be
interpreted as an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; when it gets around to checking for keyboard
input, and you might not want that next &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.)</p><p>Although the CND installation creates standard users, it
seems to forget their passwords; it creates standard groups using
the User Private Group scheme.</p><p>The bootroot program (located in the CD's &lt;\\&gt;dos
directory), which is supposed to lead you through the creation of
the startup floppies, proved to be a memory hog, refusing to write
anything to the disks on some of my test machines. I found that
once I selected the appropriate &ldquo;boot&rdquo; and &ldquo;root&rdquo; files, rawrite
was the best means of creating the necessary disks on those
computers.</p><p>My workplace computer has a Matsushita CD player connected to
the computer through a Media Magic sound card (I used &ldquo;other SCSI&rdquo;
during kernel selection). Both work well, but this CD player has a
motor-driven CD tray; during installation, the kernel causes the
tray to go in and out like a cuckoo&mdash;some six times during an
install. Don't blame either Caldera or Red Hat, as I was tempted to
do; this seems to be a Linux Fact of Life.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x1b38380"></a>Politics</h2></div></div><p>Caldera asserts that despite recent improvements in
commercial distributions, Linux still lacks acceptance as an
operating environment in the commercial world (although some recent
<i  >Linux Journal</i> articles have shown matters to be gradually
changing). Some of the reasons given: Linux is often perceived as
having been developed by unskilled students, and installation and
configuration are challenging for the uninitiated. Further, they
point out, Linux offers no accountability: it is all but
unsupported by mainstream applications, and it can't provide a
complete solution to users' needs&mdash;networking, gui, and so
on.</p><p>I leave it up to you to decide if any of these are straw men.
In any case, the entrepreneurs at Caldera label these &ldquo;barriers to
growth.&rdquo; And in order to remove those barriers, they have brought
us the Caldera Network Desktop. They will &ldquo;add value to Linux by
creating and providing a platform for commercial products that can
appeal to major users and spread the use of Linux to new areas that
traditionally would not have considered using it.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x1b38538"></a>The future, Mr. Gittes</h2></div></div><p>What lies ahead for this package? Again, from the CD's
preview document:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a more mature WWW/HTML browser</p></li><li><p>sophisticated, commercial-grade tape backup
system</p></li><li><p>a new graphical interface to many utilities and
programs</p></li><li><p>commercial personal productivity
applications</p></li><li><p>better Internet access applications</p></li></ul></div><p>Although it isn't yet possible to upgrade from one release to
another, Caldera says that &ldquo;such tools are planned for the final
1.0 release.&rdquo; [Those tools are in Preview 2, which has just been
released&mdash;Ed] Something Caldera calls the InfoTrack database
support system will become part of the overall technical support.
OpenDoc support is in the offing. And ELF work is under way.
[Again, Preview 2 is based on ELF&mdash;Ed]</p><p>How about Linux in general? A number of commercial packages
are said to run on Linux, including Word Perfect and Oracle 7.
Indeed, Caldera includes the SCO Word Perfect demo, and one of
Caldera's future offerings includes Word Perfect itself. Perhaps
Linux is being moved in this direction, with or without
Caldera.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1646580.0x1b38ab8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Caldera says it wants to &ldquo;shield end-users from the ordered
chaos that creates and grows Linux, so they can use it as their
operating system of choice.&rdquo; Well, I've grown jaded over the
years&mdash;cynical, I suppose (must be that stint as a Windows 95 beta
tester). When so much of a software package actually works, I am
surprised; and this first release of Caldera's Network Desktop has
been, to my mind, a remarkable success.</p><p>My suspicion is that the people who buy Caldera will be
expecting a software package they can simply install and run. And,
if you take a few precautions (have enough disk space; know your
video numbers; and&mdash;yes&mdash;RTFM), that's exactly what
happens.</p><p>Some take the commercialization of the Net to signal the End
of Things as We Know Them. Will products like Caldera mean the end
of Linux as we know it? I think not&mdash;the philosophies are not
mutually exclusive. True, Caldera &ldquo;uses&rdquo; Linux, which is GNU
freeware, to make money. Still, I think Caldera will prove to be
good for Linux. The solidity of Linux makes a product like Caldera
possible; and the success of Caldera will make Linux accessible to
people who don't want to tinker&mdash;who just want to learn, or maybe
even do some work.</p><p>Meanwhile, in true Linux tradition, &ldquo;programmers the world
over&rdquo; are doing a fine job of bashing this package&mdash;breaking it,
fixing it, feeding the fixes back to the folks at Caldera. The
&ldquo;First Customer Ship&rdquo; will be a better, more solid product because
of this test cycle.</p><p>I like the product. It can't pretend to be plug-and-play, but
it installs easily, runs well, looks great, and&mdash;unless you try to
stretch it too far&mdash;keeps on running. Caldera wouldn't exist
without Linux; Linux could continue to exist without Caldera, but
this certainly ups the ante.</p></div></div>
