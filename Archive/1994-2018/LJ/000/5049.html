    Hacker and civil libertarian protest against the MPAA scheduled for today, Friday, February 4, 2000.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x153c580.0x1634138"></a></h2></div></div><p>At movie theaters all over the world,
hackers, civil libertarians, Linux enthusiasts and their friends
will be passing out this
<a href="http://www.2600.com/news/2000/0130-flyer/flyer.html" target="_self">flyer</a>
to movie-goers and passers-by in protest of the recent actions
taken against the Linux community, DeCSS author Jon Lech Johansen,
DVD users, and technological freedom in general.</p><p>The DVD-CCA (DVD Copy Control Association) developed a weak
encryption scheme which it intended to use in order to have
complete control over the DVD player market. Manufacturers of DVD
players would have to pay heavy licensing fees, and would have to
submit their players to being able to play only certain DVDs
(according to regional encoding). The industry enjoys releasing
movies in the U.S. at middle-range prices, and then releasing them
at a higher price six months later in Europe, something which it
has been able to do owing to the different formats used by American
and European VHS. With DVDs, one could theoretically buy a DVD in
America and play it in Europe, China, India or New Zealand.
However, regional encoding, though illegal according to
international trade laws and the internal laws of many nations,
would have enabled the industry to prevent American DVDs from
working anywhere but America&mdash;in other words, a clever restriction
against free trade. This allows the industry to release movies
slowly, trickling them out at the optimum prices specific to each
country, in order to extract as much money as possible. Worst of
all for the hacker community, however, is that DVDs can only be
played on Windows and Mac computers, through proprietary players,
but not on Linux.</p><p>MoRE (Masters of Reverse Engineering) broke the weak
encryption algorithm and released the findings in order to enable
the development of a free DVD player for Linux. The DVD-CCA was
furious, not because of potential piracy as was alleged, but
because this code would disable their dominance of the player
market, as well as putting an end to regional coding and other
practices, such as continent-specific censorship. The DVD-CCA sent
the lawyers of the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)
after web sites on which the decryption algorithm was explained.
This initially resulted in suits against 60 sites, and later over
500 Web sites were named. The pinnacle of brilliance came when Jon
Lech Johansen's home was raided by special police at the intimation
of the MPAA (see <a href="../000/5050.html" target="_self">Crackers and
Crackdowns</a> for complete details on this event and the DVD
situation). Shortly thereafter, 2600 The Hacker Quarterly began
promoting protests. Within a few days, this press release was
issued:</p><p>---</p><p>February 2, 2000</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>DAY OF ACTION PLANNED AGAINST MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION IN
100 CITIES</p><p>Members of the hacker and open source communities worldwide,
along with various civil liberties groups, are planning a massive
leafletting campaign on Friday, February 4 to call attention to the
recent attempts by the Motion Picture Association of America to
shut down thousands of web sites.</p><p>Lawsuits have been filed against hundreds of people, as well
as an Internet Service Provider and a magazine, for having
information the MPAA wants to keep secret.</p><p>The controversy centers around a computer program known as
DeCSS, thought to be written by a 16 year old in Norway. The
program defeats the encryption scheme used by DVD's which prohibits
them from being viewed on non-approved machines or computers. It
also enables DVD's from one country to be played in another,
contrary to the wishes of the movie industry. It does NOT
facilitate DVD piracy - in fact, copying DVD's has been possible
since their introduction years ago. In its press releases on the
subject, the MPAA has claimed that this is a piracy issue, and they
have subsequently succeeded in getting injunctions against a number
of sites that had posted the program in the interests of free
speech.</p><p>This is in effect a lawsuit against the entire Internet
community by extremely powerful corporate interests. The lawsuit
and the various actions being planned promise to be a real showdown
between two increasingly disparate sides in the technological age.
The consequences of losing this case are so serious that civil
libertarians, professors, lawyers and a wide variety of others have
already stepped forward to help out.</p><p>Friday's action will be coordinated in 74 cities throughout
North America and 26 cities in other parts of the world.
Leafletting will take place outside theaters and video stores in
these cities - all of which participate in a monthly &ldquo;2600&rdquo;
gathering. 2600 Magazine has been named in two lawsuits regarding
the DeCSS program and has joined with the growing number of people
who will fight these actions by the MPAA until the end.</p><p>The lawsuit has been filed by the Motion Picture Association
of America, Columbia/Tristar, Universal City Studios, Paramount
Pictures, Disney Enterprises, Twentieth Century Fox,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Time Warner Entertainment.</p><p>Contact: Emmanuel Goldstein (631) 751-2600 ext. 0</p><p>---</p><p>The protests will be <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> Friday, as in,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>today</em></span>. In order to participate, check the
<a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_self">2600 homepage</a> for details
or follow these instructions:</p><p>o Print out this
<a href="http://www.2600.com/news/2000/0130-flyer/flyer.html" target="_self">flyer</a>
as black on white.</p><p>o Photocopy this flyer around one hundred times or more on
brightly colored paper.</p><p>o Check in the back of 2600 magazine or on their website for
the list of <a href="http://www.2600.com/meetings" target="_self">meeting
places</a> in your city so that you can meet other hackers at
around 5 p.m. and have company while passing out the flyers.</p><p>o Stand outside of your local cinema (preferably mainstream
cinemas rather than independent film houses) and hand the flyers
out to anyone willing to take them. 2600 has advice on how to be
successful at this.</p><p>Additionally</p><p>o Many people have suggested joining the
<a href="http://www.eff.org" target="_self">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a>. I have contributed as much as I can afford, and
believe them to be a good investment in humanity's future. It may
also be a good time to subscribe to
<a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_self">2600</a>.</p><p>o Remember that we're boycotting the motion picture industry,
in particular Sony (Columbia/Tristar), Disney, Warner Brothers,
MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Universal Studios, so when seized with the
desire to see a movie, remember independent film!</p><p>Important Links:</p><p><a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_self">2600 - The Hacker
