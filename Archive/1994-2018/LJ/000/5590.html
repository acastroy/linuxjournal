    Catching up with maddog on the Linux Lunacy cruise.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c02580.0x1cfa240"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the last couple of years, there have
been a number of Geek Cruises on the Holland-America cruise line,
but this year saw the first Linux Lunacy cruise. Featured speakers
included Eric Raymond, Richard Stallman, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, Michael
Johnson, <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s own Doc Searls and
Reuven Lerner (okay, so he doesn't work for us full time, but we
still claim him) and many others.</p><p>Doc and I took advantage of the position of so many Linux
celebrities (that is, on a boat with <i  >LJ</i>
editors and nowhere to run) and got a number of interviews. Look
for the interviews and other articles, including a full cruise
report, here on the site and in the pages of the magazine.</p><p>One of maddog's talks was on why Linux is like a pianola
(player piano), explaining that both benefit from open standards. I
snatched about 15 minutes with maddog on the final day of the
cruise to discuss with him his exploits with Linux International
and his fascination with player pianos.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Could you
briefly describe your role with Linux
International?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> I'm executive
director of Linux International, which means that I try to keep the
whole thing running. A lot of that is going around to different
conferences, meeting with groups, etc., to talk about Linux. Some
of it is trying to maintain the Linux trademark and protect
it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Is
protecting it sometimes difficult?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Sometimes it's
unpleasant because some people try to use the Linux name for things
that really aren't very kosher. Like the time a guy tried to start
a porn site with the name Linuxchicks.com, and Deb Richardson, who
started
<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org" target="_self">www.linuxchix.org</a>,
was understandably upset about this and requested that we go in and
stop it. But Linus wants the word Linux to be used in any
legitimate form, so now we've set up a thing called the Linux Mark
Institute; it's a nonprofit. It charges a minimal amount of money
if you want to use the word Linux in a registered trademark. If you
want to use it on a t-shirt or a coffee mug, a promotional item,
then that's free. We're hoping that the money that comes from this
will make it self-maintaining and cover legal costs. From time to
time we have to pull in lawyers to sew things up.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>So to
this point it hasn't generated much money?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Well it hasn't
generated much because we tried to grandfather as much as possible
all the people who have used the word Linux before we had the mark
set up. But we do have to police it, and it does cost money.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>When I
saw you at CeBITT in Germany, I noticed you had the chance to talk
with the German Minister of the Environment and other important
officials. Is that pretty typical for you, that you're able to set
up meetings as you travel with such high ranking
people?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Absolutely, as much
as possible. I also do a lot of interviews with newspaper
reporters. I really don't care that my name gets in print, that's
not the issue. The issue is that what Linux is gets out there into
the general press as much as possible, and that people get a good
understanding of what Linux is useful for and how they can save
money and have choices with Linux. One of the things I'm very proud
of with Linux International is that we maintain a very balanced
message. We don't over sell it, and we don't say that everything
has to be open sourced. We have members like Oracle, who obviously
put out a binary application. We're just happy that they decided to
port it to Linux. When it comes to things like databases or office
suites and things like that, you do have a choice. The higher up
the food chain you go, the more choice you typically have. We're
trying to make sure people have that choice and that Linux is the
underlying choice as an operating system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>When you
get a chance to speak to high-ranking official and have only a few
moments with them, what's your strategy? What kinds of things to
you try to discuss with them?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> What I try to show
them is that Linux gives them an opportunity to, number one, cut
their costs of government and, number two, show them that they have
the chance to build a computer infrastructure inside their company
or government that they haven't had before. They can have an open
operating system that allows their people to go in and make changes
to fit their culture and save a lot of money. You can also save
money in that it runs on typically smaller machines that Microsoft
products run on.</p><p>And quite frankly, from a military standpoint, or a
government privacy standpoint, it's better for them to have
something they can take a look at in their own country as opposed
to have to depend upon one company in the United States.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>I
remember that about the time we were in Germany for CeBITT, the
German military was saying they would no longer use Microsoft or
any US software for fear of a back door. Does that issue come up
often?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Absolutely; you know
you can't blame them. They see these messages come out of the
United States where some of our legislators want back doors, and
they wonder, &ldquo;Are there going to be back doors in the software we
install in our machines?&rdquo; That brings up another thing that much of
our government doesn't understand&mdash;that if there is a back door,
other people can find out how to open that door just as easily as
our government can. Fortunately, many of those who were putting
forth that legislation were made aware of that and seem to have
backed down from that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>In your
talk &ldquo;Linux Is Like a Pianola&rdquo;, you mention that you started
collecting old player pianos because your smaller collector items,
such as clocks, became too expensive. But you must have had some
interest or passion other than that to begin collecting something
so large and difficult to restore.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Well, the passion
came because, when I started with computers you ran one program at
a time, you saw the blinking lights, you heard the grunts and
groans the disk made&mdash;you could tell what the computer was doing.
Today, because computers run multiprocesses, you couldn't
differentiate one from the other.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>The user
is so isolated from the functions of the tool.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> Right. So, I could
watch everything that was going on inside this clock or this player
piano and see just how it worked.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>So it's a
passion for the mechanical complexity, rather than a musical
one?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> It's a mechanical
passion, I like music. But the other thing is I feel like I'm
helping to preserve a little bit of history. I mean these things
would have been flushed down the tubes if there hadn't been
somebody to donate some money to fix them up and make them viable
again. My feeling is that by doing this I can help keep these
things alive. So, as I get on in years and maybe have to downgrade
the size of my house, I will be donating my reed organs and player
pianos to some museum that would like to have them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Are you
working now on restoring them?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> They are
restored.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Did you
do it yourself?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>maddog:</b></span> I don't restore them
myself because, like a lot of other things, if I try to do the
restoration myself, they would end up in pieces in my garage for a
long period of time. Clocks I can do in a day, but a player piano
takes about a month or two of solid work to make it as good as it
should be. So I pay people to refurbish it and then I enjoy it, you
know, by playing it. And I research and I say okay, here's a
Beckworth piano, when was it made? What was its life
history?</p><p>In doing that I started to find the correlation between the
player pianos and Linux. First it was just the player pianos and
UNIX, and quite oddly that didn't work as well because there were
different flavors of UNIX. You couldn't have one application run
across all of them [maddog's talk explained that some player piano
music reproducers were &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; and couldn't be played on all
pianos], but with Linux, because of things like the LSB, which I
feel very strongly about, we hope to have one player piano upon
which everything will work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>That will
be terrific. Thanks very much for your time.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Richard Vernon</b></span> is the Editor
