    Learning about and using the three disk modes of VMware's GSX

that you are the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; guy for something, and the next thing you
know people start knocking on your cubicle. For me, this particular
scenario happened very recently.</p><p>It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, and I was cruising
along with the daily tasks of a typical IT systems engineer. You
know, rebooting Windows servers, applying endless security patches
and so on. The Linux boxes were fine. Nothing really to do there
but check the logs, the backups and snicker over the uptime.</p><p>So I'm sitting in my palatial 8&ldquo; x 8&rdquo; cubicle having a nice
cup of Starbucks, when it happens. I hear the unmistakable sound of
rushed breathing behind me. Kind of like Darth Vadar, but without
the shiny black helmet. You know what flashes through your mind in
situations like this: someone has a last minute problem and expects
me to fix it for them.</p><p>Before me stands a recently ordained project manager who
proceeds to babble on about how a business group needs a new
development/test environment ready to go in a day and a half&mdash;nice
planning, huh?. Already my mind is thinking about the late nights
and possibly a ruined weekend. You see, they want me to be around
to build and rebuild Windows servers as they test different
versions of code for a project in the final stages of development.
Should the programs or activities pooch a server, they need someone
to quickly rebuild and configure it for continued testing. Right,
no problem.</p><p>Now, I'm a salary kind of guy. There's no chance of
gratuitous overtime here, just a hearty, &ldquo;You can take care of this
for us right? Good. Gotta go!&rdquo; So, what's the solution? You guessed
it&mdash;Linux to the rescue. If you have read any of my previous
articles here on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site
describing the use and configuration of Linux with VMware's GSX
server, you can probably see where I'm going with this. By
utilizing the VMware GSX server product running on a Red Hat Linux
server, I can host multiple instances of pretty much any OS out
there. To solve Mr. Last Minute project manager's issues, we can
use virtual instances of Windows 2000 AS running on a Linux host
server to handle all the testing needs of the requesting business
group.</p><p>Besides the fact that it's cool to be able to run multiple
instances of virtual servers on a single Linux host server, easily
being able to manage or back out changes to the OS and applications
within the virtual server instances is even cooler.</p><p>VMware uses something called disk modes in both its server
and workstation products. These modes provide you with the ability
to control which changes get written to disk within the virtual
instance and which can be undone or rolled back. The three disk
modes available are persistent, undoable and non-persistent. The
first mode, persistent, is just what it sounds like it would be.
Anything installed or changed on the instance (applications,
configuration changes, etc.) is committed to disk as normal. As
soon as the OS commits the data to the disk, it is there
permanently (well, until it crashes).</p><p>With undoable mode, you have the option of keeping or
discarding any changes made to the server during a working session.
All changes are kept in a redo log, which allows you either to
commit the changes to disk or to back out the changes completely.
Using this mode is way faster than uninstalling everything you
added and trying to clean up the mess in the registry.</p><p>Finally, we have nonpersistent mode, aka, manager or tester
mode. This mode is where we really can save time and headaches for
our project manager friend, who is still breathing down our necks.
Placing a virtual server instance in nonpersistent mode lets
testers bang away at it with their test code and applications.
Should they pooch the server or need to start over fresh, all we do
is shut the server down and power it back up again, all fresh and
clean. You see, once the virtual server is built and configured the
way we want it, we place the disks in nonpersistent mode. That way
we have a clean build every time the virtual server boots. If the
testers break the server or the code behaves badly, we simply power
cycle the instance and start over.</p><p>As an added bonus, once the first virtual server instance is
created, configured and ready to go, we can stop the instance and
clone it. This gives us exact clone backup instances if need be. It
also works if the need arises for more servers. These backup
instances can be on-line and ready to go in minutes. We are talking
about five minutes vs. two or more hours per server; try that with
physical hardware or Norton Ghost.</p><p>To take advantage of these disk modes (again, this works for
virtual instances in either GSX/ESX or VMware workstation
environments), open the configuration editor in the VMware Remote
Console for your virtual instance. Be sure you do this with the
virtual server powered off. Next select the appropriate disk device
list (SCSI or IDE) and the active disk. In the box to the right,
select the Mode drop down and then the particular mode you would
like to use. This step looks a little different if you are using
the remote console under Windows (Figure 1). Click OK and restart
the virtual server. That's all there is to it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6531f1.large.jpg"><img src="6531f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Virtual Server
Remote Console Under Windows</b></span></p></div></div><p>Keep in mind that you can change modes whenever you deem it
necessary. For instance, if you are currently running in persistent
mode, but need to test a service pack, you can stop the instance
and place the disks in nonpersistent mode. This way if a problem
comes up, you can back it out. Otherwise, if the coast is clear,
you can commit the changes once you know it's safe. Another use for
nonpersistent mode would be to create a safe environment and see
what that new virus does to a Microsoft OS and, ultimately, your
production servers.</p><p>Finally, a word of caution. If you plan to run GSX virtual
servers on Linux, be sure to use the latest kernel release and ext3
filesystem supported by VMware. Trust me here, you don't want all
your virtual servers living on an ext2 filesystem when the power
goes out. I lost an entire partition and could not find a working
superblock to recover from (no, this was not a production box, and
the UPS has been replaced). With the ReiserFS, I never have had a
problem.</p><p>Once again, a profound thanks to Linux and the good people at
VMware. As it turned out my weekend wasn't a wash after all, and
the testing went on without issue (thanks again to undoable
mode).</p><p>With the performance and stability that Linux provides, I can
run multiple virtual servers on a single box and save our IT shop
big bucks, and nobody knows the difference. In fact, unless a
business partner or customer asks, they don't even know they are
working on a virtual server. Don't ask, don't tell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d94580.0x1e8ca80"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_self">VMware</a></p><p><a href="http://redhat.com" target="_self">Red Hat, Inc.</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeffrey McDonald</b></span> is a UNIX
