Cruise</a>, but the
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/OLD/ll2_home.html" target="_self">second
one</a> did the job nicely.</p><p>Co-sponsored by <a href="http://geekcruises.com" target="_self">Geek
Cruises</a> and <i  >Linux Journal</i>, both trips
departed Ft. Lauderdale for a week of topical talks and intensive
schmoozing, interrupted by shore excursions at various ports of
call. Where last year's trip journeyed to the Eastern Caribbean
(the far points were Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), this
year's looped around the Western Caribbean, stopping at Cozumel,
Grand Cayman Island, Jamaica and Half Moon Cay. The latter is a
tiny island owned by
<a href="http://www.hollandamerica.com" target="_self">Holland America</a>,
which operates the
<a href="http://www.hollandamerica.com/fivestarfleet/maasdam.htm" target="_self">ms
Maasdam</a>, our ship for both cruises.</p><p>Geek Cruises is the brainchild of &ldquo;Captain&rdquo;
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/07/17/1757239&amp;mode=thread" target="_self">Neil
Bauman</a>, who has led thirteen of these junkets so far. The
original idea was to combine the best of two very different worlds:
the industry event and the vacation cruise. The result is more than
the sum of those parts. I go to a lot of trade events, and I don't
think any of them does more to move forward the thinking of
everybody who participates. And certainly none of them does more
with a venue.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6419f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
ESR, Multitasking
</p></div></div><p>In real estate, the old saying goes, the three things that
matter most are &ldquo;location, location and location&rdquo;. Geek Cruises
pluralizes all three and then some. How many hotels move from one
ideal setting to another, treat you to food and room service around
the clock and let you wander around the roof to visit the sun or
the stars whenever you like? And how many put two pools, two hot
tubs, a tennis court, a basketball court, a bar, a cocktail lounge,
a volleyball court and a kids' playroom up there too?</p><p>The Maasdam isn't the biggest cruise ship in the world, but
at 55,451 gross registered tons (each ton is 100 cubic feet), a
length of 720 feet and a beam of 120 feet, it's large enough. I
don't know if the ship was full, but its 633 staterooms hold up to
1,266 guests. With 128 Linux Lunatics on board, that meant at least
one in ten passengers belonged to our crowd.</p><p>Did we stand out? Who cares. We had an outstanding time. And
I'm betting Linux is the better for it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0d9d0"></a>The Venue</h2></div></div><p>The sessions were held in a variety of meeting rooms, dining
rooms, bars and theaters of various sizes, all of which were quite
comfortable. All the talks were highly interactive, in some cases
more like seminars or master classes than like lectures.</p><p>Neil provided power bars so participants with laptops could
keep their batteries charged. He also arranged to have the library
and adjacent meeting covered with a WiFi signal that connected
participants to the Net. The cost was 30 cents per minute, sold in
100, 500 and 1,000 minute blocks. This was well below the fees
charged for the dedicated Windows machines in the internet cafe.
Throughput each time I checked it ran around 150kb downstream and
85kb upstream, which wasn't bad considering the route traveled by
all those packets: 50,000 miles between dry land and a rocking
boat, by way of geosynchonous satellite.</p><p>The connection was provided by
<a href="http://www.digitalseas.com" target="_self">Digital Seas</a>, and
it was a huge improvement over the first cruise, when all we had
was the internet cafe. My only frustrations with the WiFi system
were caused by its eagerness to terminate connections after five
minutes of idle time (which often seemed like less)--a cost-saving
kindness I could have could have done without.</p><p>But this was something of an experimental setup, and the
Digital Seas people were eager to solicit suggestions for future
cruises. Mine was to sell the whole week as a block of time, so
users won't have to watch the clock like a hawk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d15580.0x1e0dc38"></a>Day-by-Day Rundown</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Day One</b></span> (Sunday, October 20)
saw the boat open for boarding at 11 in the morning. Passengers
steadily streamed in until the 3pm deadline; we had a scheduled
launch of 5:30pm. Even though the temperature was hot and muggy (it
stayed hot and calm through the entire trip) and some of the lines
were long, boarding was a fairly fast and easy process (much easier
than for the first cruise). Departure was slightly delayed when the
captain kindly held the boat so a straggler could make it from the
airport. Apparently it didn't make much difference, since ours was
the last ship out of the harbor.</p><p>The Holland America people made hanging out and schmoozing
very easy from the moment of arrival. Live (and expertly played)
Caribbean music played on the decks, and there was plenty of food
and drink to go around. If you want, you can pretty much eat, drink
and party your way around the clock for the whole cruise.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Day Two</b></span> (Monday, October 21)
was a full day at sea, with plenty of classes to attend while the
ship eased past the Florida Keys and the Sierra del Rosario, the
rugged mountains of Western Cuba. In the card room,
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/home.html" target="_self">Ted
Ts'o</a> gave his &ldquo;Introduction to the Linux Kernel&rdquo; talk. Down
in the movie theater, Dirk Elmendorf gave a talk titled
&ldquo;Introduction to PHP&rdquo;. In another meeting room, Randal Schwartz did
&ldquo;Learning Perl&rdquo;. In the piano bar, Greg Haerr spoke on &ldquo;User
Interface Programming and Architecture Using Embedded Linux&rdquo;. (The
only bummer there was he declined to play the piano, even though
he's reportedly as good on the ivory keyboard as he is on the
QWERTY.) At lunch Eric Raymond talked about &ldquo;The Open Source
Revolution&rdquo;. In the afternoon, Randall and Ted revisited their
subjects while Guido van Rossum gave his &ldquo;Introduction to Python&rdquo;
talk.</p><p>The evening talk was Eric Raymond's &ldquo;The Zen of UNIX&rdquo;, which
ended at 7:30. Dinner in the vast formal dining room followed at
8:15 each night of the week.</p><p>Two families were assigned to our large round table: the
Torvalds and the Searls. At its maximum this totaled four parents
and four kids (their three girls, our one boy). On most evenings,
though, two or more kids were elsewhere, and we were joined by
other adults&mdash;usually Ted T'so and Greg Haerr, plus one or two
others who jumped in from other tables. Even though the seating is
assigned, there's a fair amount of swapping around. So at various
times our table also included folks who hacked professionally for
<a href="http://lindows.com" target="_self">Lindows</a>,
<a href="http://www.emperorlinux.com" target="_self">Emperor Linux</a>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>USA Today</em></span> and Nickelodeon (yes, Linux has
entered those bastions too).</p><p>Each dinner had its own dress code: formal on Tuesday and
Thursday, and either informal or casual on the other evenings. For
men informal meant wearing a jacket. Casual meant pants. Shoes and
shorts were required in every case. The result was a kaleidescope
of costumery, with fun combinations of everything from tuxedos to
old schwag t-shirts.</p><p>Cutest, of course, were the three Torvalds girls, who were
extraordinarily charming, smart, funny and well-behaved, especially
after they fell asleep at the table. (Yes, there were other kids;
but I didn't sit with them, so I can't say.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Day Three</b></span> (Tuesday) began at
Cozumel, an island off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, not far from
Canc&uacute;n. There we dispersed to a variety of towns, beaches
and Mayan ruins before reconvening on the ship for talks on
filesystems (Ted), Perl (Randall), &ldquo;Vim for Vi Users&rdquo; (Steve
Oualline) and &ldquo;Preparing for Incident Response and Forensics&rdquo;
(Brian Carrier). I gave the pre-dinner keynote, &ldquo;The Silent
Majority: How Linux Got to Be Everywhere While Nobody Was
Watching&rdquo;. It was a fun talk for a fun crowd. The only criticism
came from one guy who said, &ldquo;There weren't enough laughs at the
end.&rdquo; Which still means he was entertained for nearly an
hour.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Day Four</b></span> (Wednesday) began
with a series of tender boats that ferried passengers from the
Maasdam to Georgetown, Grand Cayman. Here our family of three
recruited Greg Haerr and Ted Ts'o to join us in a taxi tour of the
island. The high point of that trip was a lunch on the porch of the
<a href="http://www.caribbean-on-line.com/diningreviews/cy/020212165837.shtml" target="_self">Cracked
Conch</a> restaurant, not far up the road from a tourist trap
called
<a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_2230886532" target="_self">Hell</a>.
The food and drink was excellent, along with the setting. We
finished the day hanging out on Seven Mile Beach, a beautiful
place. That evening Linus treated the crowd to a wide-ranging
Q&amp;A. (More about that later.) Charles Shapiro recorded the talk
and encoded it as an Ogg Vorbis file that you can
