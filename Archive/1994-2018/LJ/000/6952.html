    A look behind the scenes and OSS in Texas: why is the media
    ignoring it and how did Houston buck the system?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198c240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Texas state agencies spend more than $450
million annually on information technology, not counting staffing
costs and purchases from local or federal funds. With this amount
of money in play, Texas is a significant target for hardware,
software and technical support vendors.</p><p>Key Texans believe state and local governments should embrace
Linux and open-source software (OSS) to reduce taxes. The local
media decided differently and did not inform the general public
about OSS initiatives in the legislature. This is especially odd,
as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Houston Chronicle</em></span> runs Linux on an IBM
mainframe and the city administrators made the front page of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>USA Today</em></span> for bucking Microsoft. In addition
to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chronicle</em></span>, the parent of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dallas Morning News</em></span>, Belo Corporation, uses
Linux to host web sites and invested heavily in :CueCat, a product
driven by the Linux operating system. So, advocates of the OSS bill
feel baffled.</p><p>Specifically, when Texas Senator John Carona filed SB 1579, a
bill to make the state consider OSS, the media remained silent.
Most voters did not have a clue that the State Auditor's Office put
annual IT spending at $1.4 billion. But, those costs did not escape
Senator Carona.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198c558"></a>Who Has Fiscal Responsibility?</h2></div></div><p>The Texas State Auditor's office looked at the state's 21
largest IT projects; they found that average project deficiency was
$388,000 over budget and 21 months behind schedule. Those numbers
did not include the cost of the TIERS project, which came in $349
million over budget and 37 months overdue. Still, no media coverage
was given.</p><p>Budget deficits caused state legislators to eliminate
critical programs this year. How did the Department of Information
Resources (DIR) escape budget cuts? License fees on $450 million
servers alone should be a prime candidate to look at for savings.
Texans still failed to see any media coverage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198c6b8"></a>Not All as It Seems?</h2></div></div><p>The much-maligned Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ)
has computers ranging from six to eight years in age. Microsoft, a
major technology vendor in the state, claimed that TDCJ owed them
millions of dollars. The problem: the state only requires agencies
to keep records for five years.</p><p>Microsoft believed its license requirements exceed those of
state law. They demanded TDCJ produce receipts, agree to an
expensive licensing arrangement or face millions of dollars of
fines. The TDCJ audit showed a shortage of 2,000 licenses due to
lack of receipts, and the cost of replacing those licenses was
$280,000. As Microsoft's new suggested licensing arrangement did
not fit TDCJ's budget, TDCJ instead sent Microsoft a check for
$283,000.</p><p>But, if spending exceeds $450 million annually, why does TDCJ
use old computers? Also, how does this busy agency get by with
those computers?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198c870"></a>Would Shareholders Tolerate This?</h2></div></div><p>The State Comptroller's office noted five canceled IT
projects worth $28 million. Total project losses equated to 86% of
our $450 million annual spending. Funding for the losses and
overruns came from federal or local tax dollars.</p><p>The Comptroller published recommendations for the budget on
the State's web site prior to this year's Legislative session.
Among other points, she noted the &ldquo;Texas Department of Information
Resources (DIR) should be held accountable for the success of major
agency information technology (IT) projects. The Program Management
Office (PMO) within DIR is not meeting its legislative
mandates.&rdquo;</p><p>In another excerpt, the Comptroller wrote, &ldquo;The TexasOnline
Division should help DIR redesign its Web site to make it easier
for visitors to find information and to provide a public software
clearinghouse to help reduce commodity software purchasing
costs.&rdquo;</p><p>For the full text of the report, see
<a href="http://www.window.state.tx.us/etexas2003" target="_self">&ldquo;Limited
Government, Unlimited Opportunity, January 2003&rdquo;</a>. The
citations mentioned above come from the section titled
<a href="http://www.window.state.tx.us/etexas2003/gg18.html" target="_self">&ldquo;General
Government Consolidate or Eliminate Agencies or Programs&rdquo;</a>,
under GG 18.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198cb30"></a>Should Voters and Taxpayers Tolerate
This?</h2></div></div><p>The above information has not reached the public through
traditional media. Considering the plethora of Linux and OSS
successes Texas has had, again this lack of coverage seems strange.
With plentiful workers, a depression in the IT job market and
extensive Linux resources, what would Texans say if they knew what
was happening?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198cc38"></a>Vaporware and Some Spin</h2></div></div><p>The DIR published standards and recommendations for OSS.
That's not a typo. SRRPUB09 OSS exists at
<a href="http://www.dir.state.tx.us/standards/srrpub09.htm" target="_self">www.dir.state.tx.us/standards/srrpub09.htm</a>.
An executive summary is included in the document, which
reads</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The United States, European Commission, and other
nations have started addressing the use of OSS solutions in public
sector and e-government applications. Many of the applications used
in government could be obtained and improved using the model (e.g.,
registration, licensing, certification, permitting). This should
support purchasing best value solutions and removing the reliance
on an individual information technology vendor.
</p><p>Agencies should consider Open Source solutions in information
technology procurements, and the criteria for selecting a specific
solution should be based on best value. Agencies should use
products that support open standards and specifications in all
applications. Agencies should consider obtaining full rights to the
software code it procures wherever this achieves best value.</p></blockquote></div><p>One might wonder about the need for Senator Carona's bill, SB
1579 in light of DIR's SRRPUB09-OSS agency-wide recommendations to
use open source software. Recall, though, that the comptroller
wrote, &ldquo;the Program Management Office (PMO) within DIR is not
meeting its legislative mandates&rdquo;. If the PMO cannot meet external
legislative mandates, one might wonder how it can meet its
own.</p><p>Microsoft appears to be the influencer of opposition to
Senator Carona's bill on OSS. Microsoft contends that when you look
at the total costs of ownership, OSS has no advantage. Linux users
know that's disinformation. We had postings on
<a href="../000/6927.html" target="_self">last week's article</a> that
concurred, such as this one:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As someone who actually DOES work for government,
I think that open source is perfect for government! We need the
security, and we can (and do) train our own people, not ship them
overseas (!!!) for training as suggested. Support is a non-issue
because we can read the source code, understand it, and change
whatever we don't like. Not to mention our budget, since we're
currently laying off dozens of employees. Eliminating our
MS-related costs could have saved at least a quarter of those
peoples' jobs.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198d058"></a>The City of Houston</h2></div></div><p>Houston, on the other hand, provides a bright spot for Linux
and OSS&mdash;it has stood its ground in terms of cost cutting. The
state level might look to Houston as a model.</p><p>In January 2003, administrators for the city of Houston had
to choose between a multiyear, $12 million Microsoft licensing plan
or an audit, because Microsoft claimed Houston used software for
which it hadn't paid. Microsoft felt the public works department
fell short on 252 Office licenses. The city demonstrated it had 135
more Office licenses than it needed. Microsoft felt the library
fell short on 450 Office licenses. Houston found documentation
covering all of those copies, including 111 donated by Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates' charity foundation.</p><p>The city refused Microsoft's offer of amnesty if the city
signed a new licensing agreement. Houston chose to pay for licenses
it may have inadvertently missed. They felt $500,000 might be the
ceiling on undocumented Microsoft licenses.</p><p>The city decided on an alternative system, which delivers
software at a fraction of Microsoft's costs. Houston went with a
local productivity suite running over Web-enabled protocols. The
company, SimDesk, also provided storage for city data on its
mainframe.</p><p>In speaking with city IT managers, we discovered Houston's
experiment worked. Deployment of the alternative system went well,
and the city began to save money immediately. An IT manager who
wished to remain anonymous told us that other initiatives using
Linux already have started.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198d2c0"></a>NASA's Johnson Space Center</h2></div></div><p>NASA created a Linux desktop environment that also could run
government mandated Microsoft applications. A team of 30 engineers
continues to program in a UNIX-like environment. The team also can
create Word documents and Outlook e-mail on the same PC by using
WINE.</p><p>The Johnson Center's IT department uses Codeweaver's
CrossOver Office to give the engineers access to both open-source
software and Microsoft Office. The Office server works without
having to install CrossOver on each PC.</p><p>Furthermore, NASA may have started government interest in
Linux in Texas when it began using Beowulf Clusters. The state
since has sponsored three major Beowulf centers outside of NASA.
They include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CPGE Intel Cluster, Department of Petroleum and
Geosystems Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin;</p></li><li><p>Wonderland Texas Institute for Computational and
Applied Mathematics, University of Texas at Austin; and</p></li><li><p>Texas Tech Tornado Dept. of Computer Science (used
for both research and teaching), Texas Tech University.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198d6e0"></a>State Sponsored Medical Research</h2></div></div><p>In addition, Texas has several major university medical
schools. UT Southwestern Medical Center receives the most attention
because many Nobel Laureates are on staff. Other med schools
provide research and development, and a non-exclusive list of
schools includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas</p></li><li><p>Baylor College of Medicine</p></li><li><p>Texas Tech University, Health Sciences
Center</p></li><li><p>University of Texas, Medical Branch</p></li><li><p>University of Texas, Health Science Center-San
Antonio</p></li></ul></div><p>We found extensive use of Linux at all of these Texas medical
schools. In fact, many research grant requests define Linux as the
project's operating system. We noted Linux in use for the popular
application LabVIEW, among others. We also found Linux in use where
application development occurs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1894580.0x198dc08"></a>Remarks</h2></div></div><p>Much more information is available about the use of Linux and
OSS in Texas, including Mark Cuban's $1.7 billion take on
Broadcast.com, ATMOS Energy, Boeing's Future Combat Systems C4ISR,
the US Army 4th Infantry Division at Ft. Hood, HP/Compaq, Dell and
Oracle, IBM Austin, Law Enforcement applications and databases and
so on. I feel that information, though interesting, would provide
only diminishing returns.</p><p>Journalists have a duty to report what they find and can
corroborate. In this article we have looked at some barriers to
reducing the costs of running government on the state and local
levels. Rather than approaching this material with a sense of right
and wrong, we approached it from what works and what does not
work.</p><p>As we approach the next subject, we continue to explore where
Linux works, what it's used for, who's for it and who's against
it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom Adelstein</b></span> works as a
