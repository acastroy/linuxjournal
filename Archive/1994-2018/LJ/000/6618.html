</p><p>Have you ever looked at the source code of a well-designed
web page and were surprised to find only minimal HTML tags and a
reference to a style sheet?  That's the beauty of cascading
style sheets (CSS)--simple, easy to maintain HTML code.  A lot
can be done with CSS.  Many web designers have used CSS, but
most don't take advantage of all it has to offer.  In case
you're not familiar with CSS, it's an aspect of web design for
improving the look of a web page and for indexing the look of
several web pages. It operates off of one document that lists text
and other layout properties.  With changes that are occurring
in the web design world, knowing how to use CSS effectively is
going to be necessary if you design web pages.  If you don't
believe it, consider the fact that &lt;font&gt; and some other
formatting tags are being eliminated. &ldquo;At this point in the game,
it makes about as much sense to design without CSS as it does to
write web pages without using HTML&rdquo;, says Eric Meyer, Standards
Evangelist for Netscape.  Without CSS, you won't be able to
change the appearance of text in your HTML documents.</p><p>Several good reference books have been written that can help
you learn how to design web pages with CSS.  However, being
able to look up CSS properties and knowing how to apply them to
make great-looking web pages is a very different matter.  The
difficulty lies in that CSS, in a sense, is a kind of artistic tool
for web design.  As such, acquiring skills in using CSS
requires experimentation and, to make the process easier, the
guidance of someone who is already talented in its use.  To
that end, Eric Meyer, who is also an Invited Expert of the Web
Consortium's (<a href="http://www.w3.org" target="_self">www.w3.org</a>)
CSS working group, has written a new book in which he demonstrates
how to design web pages with CSS.  The book is called,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web
Design</em></span>.  Before reviewing Meyer's new book, though,
for those who are unfamiliar with CSS, let me explain it a bit and
give a few examples.  If you already know the basics of CSS,
then skip over this next section.</p><p>Introduction to CSS</p><p>A style sheet is a list of instructions or rules for the web
browser, so it knows how to display a particular web page.
Without a style sheet, the browser will use its default
settings for text and page layout.  A style sheet can be
located within a web page or it can be contained in a separate
document and linked to from a web page.  If a style sheet is
located within a web page, then style rules are placed between
opening and closing style tags (&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;).
Styles and style tags must be placed inside the opening and
closing header tags (&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;).  They cannot,
however, be placed within any other tags that might be located
inside the header (e.g., &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;).</p><p>Within style tags, one can place style instructions that will
be used throughout the web page.  For instance, if you wanted
all bold-faced text to be in red in addition to being bold, without
a style sheet you would have to go through the HTML document and
look for each instance of &lt;b&gt; and add a font tag after them
like this, &lt;font color=&ldquo;red&rdquo;&gt; and a closing font tag
(&lt;/font&gt;) before the closing bold faced tags (&lt;/b&gt;).
Instead of doing all of that, you could simply add the
following style sheet to the top of the web page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;style&gt;
  b{color: red;}&lt;/style&gt;
</pre><p>For consistency of style and to save time typing the style
sheet into each web page, you can set up a separate style sheet
document and link all of your web pages to it.  Links to
external style sheets read like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="main.css"&gt;
</pre><p>In this link, the name of the style sheet document is
main.css, and it's located in the same directory as the web page
that is linked to it.  A directory path can be added to the
href value if the style sheet is not in the same directory.
Incidentally, it's customary to name style sheet files with
an extension of &ldquo;css&rdquo;.</p><p>With an external style sheet, if you wanted to modify the
color and some other font attributes of the main heading on all of
the web pages linked to the style sheet, you could simply add this
rule to your style sheet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
h1 {
  text-size: 200%;
  text-align: center;
  color:  navy;
}
</pre><p>In this example, all of the text enclosed in the &lt;h1&gt;
heading tags in all of the web pages linked to this style sheet
will be displayed double the size of the normal text, centered and
in navy blue.  As you can see, once a style sheet document is
set up properly, one can easily make changes to all associated web
pages simply by changing the style sheet.  If your site has
hundreds of web pages, it would take quite some time to implement
any formatting changes.  However, it would only take you
seconds to make the changes with CSS.</p><p>There is a long list of style properties that one can set
with CSS.  If you'd like to learn more about the basics of
CSS, you can go to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_self">CSS section</a> of
the Web Consortium's site.  A good reference book on CSS is
one of Meyer's other books, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cascading Style Sheets:
The Definitive Guide</em></span>.  It has become the
staple of CSS designers, but I would suggest you consider buying
Meyer's new book (reviewed below) as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134a580.0x1442f50"></a>Format of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eric Meyer on
CSS</em></span></h2></div></div><p>The book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eric Meyer on CSS</em></span> is a good
size, glossy book of about 325 pages.  The illustrations are
full color and numerous.  Additionally, the book has a
companion web site
(<a href="http://www.ericmeyeroncss.com" target="_self">www.ericmeyeroncss.com</a>)
where one can download the HTML and CSS code presented in the
book.</p><p>Meyer uses a format of demonstrating CSS web design methods
similar to television programs in which an artist does an oil
painting of a landscape and explains to the viewer what he's doing
as he goes along.  The artist explains the colors that he
mixes and his methods of shading and so forth.  Meyer's book
is like this, and it's also like one of those woodworking or
carpentry shows where the host explains each step of the
construction process.  Except in this case, Meyer explains the
use of CSS; he's the artist and the master carpenter of CSS.
Meyer says, &ldquo;The goal was to show readers how to use CSS in
actual projects&mdash;the kinds of things they might themselves want or
have to do.&rdquo;  In his job at Netscape, Meyer assists web
designers of major web sites in using CSS.  This book is the
average web designer's access to his talents, and as such it's a
real treat to read and to work through.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134a580.0x1443478"></a>Projects</h2></div></div><p>Each chapter of Meyer's new book presents a different web
design project.  Each project starts out by defining its goals
and showing the reader a screen shot of the finished project he's
working toward.  &ldquo;In each of the 13 projects, I start with an
unstyled file and add on CSS bit by bit until there's a finished
project&rdquo;, Meyer says.  For each project, a screenshot is
provided of each step of almost every change that's made to the web
page.  The related HTML code and style rules are shown as each
project progresses, and changes made to the styles are shown in
red.  At the end of each project or every major stage of some
projects, the complete CSS style sheet is provided.  It's
fascinating to see how the projects unfold.</p><p>As an example, the first chapter or project involves a web
page that has been created by normal methods, not incorporating a
style sheet.  Meyer starts with a web page that was cleanly
and typically designed with several tables, tables within tables,
font tags and other redundant formatting tags.  He then strips
the page of all these tags, so he's left with a very plain page
consisting of mostly content and little HTML.  Next he
systematically adds style sheet rules to bring the page back to its
original look, but without all of the HTML overhead.  The
result is a much smaller document and a style sheet that can be
reused to assure consistency in design throughout the site&mdash;and one
that is much more manageable.</p><p>

</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6618f4.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Several other fascinating and inspiring projects are included
in the book.  &ldquo;Every project was intended to show the reader
how the pieces go together.  It's one thing to understand what
various CSS properties do, but seeing how to put them together in
interesting ways is quite another&rdquo;, says Meyer.  In one
project Meyer takes an events calendar and formats it rather nicely
to highlight special events (see image above).  Another
project deals with styling a sidebar menu (see image below).
Another project constructs a multicolumn web page without the
aid of tables&mdash;quite a trick.  He does it with &lt;div&gt;
tags and a style sheet.  And, in another project, Meyer shows
the process of making a separate set of style rules for printing a
web page versus viewing it on screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134a580.0x14438f0"></a>Using the Book</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Eric Meyer on CSS</em></span> is not primarily a
reference book, although it can be used as one.  Instead, it's
designed as an instructional book, a learning aid.  As Meyer
says, &ldquo;It's designed specifically to be hands-on, which I think is
the best way to learn anything.  Besides, project-centric
books tend to be more fun to read, and certainly are more fun for
me to write.&rdquo;  How you learn best dictates how you might use
the book.  To get the most out of the book, you may want to
download the HTML code off of the book's companion web site and
load it up in your text editor and web browser.  The site
provides the HTML code and style sheets for every step of each
project.  So, you can grab only the first page and edit it as
instructed by the book, or you can open up each individual HTML
document to see the changes Meyer has made each step of the way.
Playing along is particularly useful if you follow through
and do the exercises at the end of each chapter.  In the
exercises, Meyer presents instructions as to how you might further
tweak the web pages, along with a screenshot of how it should look
when you're finished.</p><p>Playing along doesn't work well for me, however.  I must
confess that I'm not disciplined enough for sample exercises.
I need real-life situations from which to learn.  So,
when I read through Meyer's book, I closely studied the style rules
and the illustrations in the book.  When I hit on something
that inspired&mdash;which was often&mdash;I dropped the book and ran over to
my computer and modified one of my web sites to include what I
learned.  Sometimes my changes didn't work like I thought they
would, and I had to go back and reread the particular section that
inspired me.  This usually involved comparing my surrounding
HTML and my style sheet to the project in the book.  This is
how I learn best.</p><p>Whether you play with the book's code or use your own as I
did, experimenting for yourself is useful in getting the most out
of the book.  If you put in the effort, you will be pleased
and surprised at how much you can accomplish with CSS.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Russell J. T. Dyer</b></span> is a Perl
