like Earth, man. Remember that happy load of crap? That heavy,
powerful idea that a bunch of nasty machines (that you cut yourself
on when you try to fix them after they crash when you're out of
town and heat up your closet and suck themselves full of strange,
clingy, powdery yet fuzzy dust) are really just the mundane shell
for some kind of magickal aether, and that on top of this substrate
rides CyBeRsPaCe&mdash;the strange and wonderful place where if you're
smart enough and imagine something and stay up really late doing
really hard things, you can call it into being and rule it.</p><p>Can I just confess something mildly embarrassing here? I had
a Macintosh and a subscription to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> in the
mid-90s. I traded the former for a 486 box to run Linux and web
stuff on well before I let the latter expire. I was starting to
believe all this cyber-folderol. I learned HTML and made this cool,
like, virtual dungeon, where you could wander around by clicking on
little blue words! And this virtual newspaper in Perl, where people
could, like, seize the media away from the Man! And I read John
Perry Barlow's &ldquo;Declaration of the Independence of
Cyberspace&rdquo;:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I declare the global social space we are building
to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on
us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any
methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.</p></blockquote></div><p>Woo hoo! Right on! Look out, military-industrial-television
complex! Cyber magick will rock your lame ass!</p><p>Fortunately, most of us have grown out of this stuff and
figured out that the Internet is a lot more like regular reality
than it lets on. (Damn!) But the epidemic of wild and woolly
cyber-woo-woo airheaditude is still out there, and this time the
people building glitter-covered stuffed-animal-sex rave palaces in
the air are the Entertainment Industry. Somehow they're going to
make their business bigger by selling us every piece of content
multiple times at a micropayment per play, and they're all going to
have perfect control of how many times everything gets copied or
played, and their pure Mind is going to call into being a consensus
reality of all poor-ass musicians getting Paid with a capital P. I
wish it were so easy. In a way, I wish I were still up late at
night with strong coffee, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span> and
a white board full of happy BS.</p><p>Anyway, this is the special Ogg Vorbis issue of this
newsletter, so get set for some tips on how to do things that will
probably be illegal soon, so don't forget these instructions are
for Entertainment Purposes Only.</p><p>Play the oggs, don't hog the pizels and make the Pause key
work.</p><p>I've looked at several of the Ogg Vorbis players out
there&mdash;and they either put a window on your screen or take up space in
some GNOME or KDE panel thingy that I don't allow on my screen
anyway.</p><p>I can't stand having a background application I rarely if
ever touch use some of the pixels I paid for. The closest player to
being cool is the command-line player ogg123, but I don't want to
start an xterm for it. It's supposed to be an audio player and has
no reason to get in my eyes&mdash;just my ears. If only there were
some way of running it in the background and sending signals to it
to tell it what to do.</p><p>It turns out you can do this. Start up an ogg123 and do a
<b  >killall -STOP ogg123</b>. It pauses. Do a
<b  >killall -CONT ogg123</b>. It starts up again. Start
up an ogg123 with several files and do a <b  >killall -INT
ogg123</b>. It skips tracks.</p><p>So, you can control ogg123 &ldquo;remotely&rdquo; with the power of
signals. Whoa!</p><p>Let's do one quick thing so that we don't hopelessly confuse
ourselves here&mdash;let's <b  >cd /usr/local/bin</b> and do
a <b  >ln -s ../../bin/ogg123 bg-ogg</b>. That way we
have what looks like a separate program called bg-ogg, so we can
&ldquo;killall&rdquo; it as much as we want without messing up any other ogg123
processes we might want to run in the foreground.</p><p>Now we can just add the player to our .xsession file, like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# find all the oggs and play them in random order forever
(while (true) do find ~/ogg -name *.ogg | xargs bg-ogg -z; done) &amp;
</pre><p>I'm assuming that your oggs live in ~/ogg&mdash;if not, you
should know what to do.</p><p>Now quit and restart X. Oggs! Playing in your ears with
nothing on the screen! Bliss! If this doesn't happen, here are some
troubleshooting hints: first, run that shell command by itself and
see if it works. Then put some random command such as</p><p><b  >touch all-hail-xsession</b></p><p>in .xsession to make sure .xsession is actually running. (I
always make .xsession and .xinitrc links to the same file so that I
don't have to remember which one gets run from startx and which one
gets run from xdm. Don't bother sending me mail to tell me which is
which; I've learned it before and just forgotten it.)</p><p>Meanwhile, for those of you who aren't cursing miscellaneous
X startup files, let's look at how to pause and restart. Do
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(test -e ~/.paused &amp;&amp; killall -CONT bg-ogg &amp;&amp; rm ~/.paused) || \
(killall -STOP bg-ogg &amp;&amp; touch ~/.paused)
</pre><p>The music paused. Do the same command again. It restarted.
Why is this important? Why not just use the -CONT and -STOP
commands individually? So that we can bind one key in the window
manager and have it act as a pause/play button, instead of having
to bind two keys.</p><p>We'll take a break now for you to fire up your window manager
configuration tool of choice, bind a key to that command, and come
back. (I don't know about you but I don't use the &ldquo;Pause&rdquo; key for
anything else.) You folks back early must be the Sawfish users;
have some coffee while we wait for the Enlightenment folks.</p><p>After that, the next binding should be easy. Just bind
<b  >killall -INT bg-ogg</b> to a different key. That's
your &ldquo;skip track&rdquo; button. And finally, you probably want a keyboard
volume control, too, so here are the commands to do that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# turn it down
aumix -v-4
# turn it up
aumix -v+4
</pre><p>You can change the 4 to a different step if you want to make
your volume control coarser. This control will affect all audio
programs on your system, not just bg-ogg. Now how much would you
pay?</p><p>Step two in this plan is to build an adapter to connect a
couple of buttons to the parallel port and write a daemon to sit
there and wait for button presses, then send the appropriate
signals. Then I can put this in my car.</p><p>The solution to the transcription problem:</p><p>Sam Phillips of dasbistro.com in Reno sent me the answer to
the &ldquo;configure Vim for transcribing&rdquo; problem I assigned you people
in the issue before last. Here's Sam's answer:</p><p>BEGIN SAM'S ANSWER</p><pre     class="screen">
&gt; 2. Configure Vim to pause an audio-playing application when the user
&gt;    hits backspace, then restart it after a configurable amount of idle
&gt;    time. This will help Your Humble Editor transcribe speeches and
&gt;    interviews for your benefit.
</pre><p>Okay, so I did some simple testing with xmms and this seems
to work:</p><p>(note: ^H = ^v and then the backspace key^M = ^v and then the
enter key)</p><p><b  >map ^H :!xmms -u^M^M</b></p><p>Of course, that just pauses it and doesn't start it again. If
you made a short shell script like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
----&gt;8---
#!/bin/sh
xmms -u
sleep 5
xmms -u
----&gt;8---
</pre><p>and put that into some file, let's say xmms-pauser.sh, and
placed that into your ~/bin, this could work with a short 5 second
pause:</p><p><b  >map ^H :!xmms-pauser.sh&amp;^M^M</b></p><p>So far both of these only work when you're not in insert
mode. Here's one that only works in insert mode:</p><p>(note: ^[ = ^v and then the Esacpe key)</p><p><b  >imap ^H
^[:!xmms-pauser.sh&amp;^M^Mi</b></p><p>Of course, now the backspace key doesn't work in insert mode,
this should fix that:</p><p><b  >imap ^H
^[:!xmms-pauser.sh&amp;^M^Mxa</b></p><p>Okay, now if you hit backspace multiple times it's going to
pause and unpause the media player erratically. This can be fixed
by only having one instance of xmms-pauser.sh running at a time
with a lock file of sorts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
----&gt;8---
#!/bin/sh
if [ -f ~/.xmms-pauser ]; then
    ppid=`cat ~/.xmms-pauser`
    echo $ppid
    ps ax | sed -e's/^[ ]\+//' | cut -d' ' -f 1 | grep "^$ppid$" &gt; /dev/null
    if [ $? = 0 ]; then
        # process is still around
        exit
    fi
fi
echo -n $$ &gt; ~/.xmms-pauser
xmms -u
sleep 5
xmms -u
rm -f ~/.xmms-pauser
----&gt;8---
</pre><p>Now we have some annoying flashing because when Vim goes to a
shell it redraws the screen. This can be fixed by using silent,
which also allows us to get rid of one of our ^Ms:</p><p><b  >imap ^H ^[:silent
!xmms-pauser.sh&amp;^Mxa</b></p><p>So there you have it. Kinda. Is that what you were thinking
of?</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>END SAM'S ANSWER</p><p>(Since this worked out medium-well, I will assign future
Exercises for the Reader in future issues.)</p><p>One more thing&mdash;spamassassin is rapidly shaping up to be
the &ldquo;Free Software of the Year&rdquo;. The spam problem has finally
gotten bad enough to be interesting. Hmm, maybe we should do a
conference on spam-fighting technology and ask John Gilmore to
speak on how to fight spam without creating a precedent for
content-based filtering by ISPs, which is some scary dookie,
freedom lovers. Check out toad.com for more info before your
spam-fighting instincts make you do something you might regret
later.</p><p>Here's yet another reason I'm a spamassassin fan. I added a
rule to match messages containing &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; (case insensitive) in the
body text. I had to set my spamassassin tolerance high enough to
allow press releases&mdash;but with the Linux rule in place I can see
which press releases are Linux-related just from the headers. A big
time saver. PR people, don't trash your precious carpal tunnel
tissue mailing me about stuff that has nothing to do with Linux. I
am a Linux bigot and proud.</p><p>And all you sons-of-bitches who sneaked out of Nigeria with
the oil money or diamonds or whatever and want my help moving it to
the USA&mdash;forget it. Take your loot back to Nigeria, tell the
truth and say you're sorry. I mean it.</p><p>&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>Don Marti</b></span> is Technical
