be imposed by the U.S. Copyright Office starting May 22.</p><p>This new &ldquo;regulatory environment&rdquo; (to borrow a term from the
progressive telecom and broadcast industries) was developed by the
<a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">Copyright Arbitration and Royalty
Panel</a>, which was convened by the Library of Congress and
delivered its recommendations several months ago. CARP's job was to
impose a variety of copyright obligations, including payments for
performance rights, on Internet broadcasters, under the
<a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~willr/cb/sos/dmcapage.shtml" target="_self">Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>.</p><p>CARP will kill Internet radio. It's that simple. The Day of
Silence is practice for the grave.</p><p>Here's the Linux angle. Many of the most innovative Internet
broadcasters&mdash;the ones whose technical smarts and
entrepreneurship have brought their stations closest to becoming
real businesses&mdash;are making creative and resourceful use of Linux
and other open source software. (We covered
<a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">the case of KPIG and Radio
Paradise</a> several months ago.) Linux and open source also
plays a role where noncommercial broadcasters need to get on the
air with a minimum of cost and fuss and a maximum of reliability.

Report</a></p></li></ul></div><p>Briefly put, the market cancer that is CARP was introduced
with the DRPA and metastasized with the DMCA.</p><p>The DRPA was drawn up when Netscape was at 1.0 and the Net
seemed to promise the alchemic morphing of every business into
something far more capable, efficient, far-reaching and
wealth-producing. Back then forward-looking folks in both industry
and government saw the Net as something that would improve
business. Almost nobody foresaw the huge distraction that
wealth-creation in the stock markets would produce instead.</p><p>The regulatory effect was to produce a law that recognized
webcasting not as a new medium for radio, but rather as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>performance venue</em></span> from which revenues could be
extracted, much as they are in a club or a concert hall. That's why
CARP regards every song played by an Internet radio station is a
&ldquo;performance&rdquo; and every listener as a potential customer.</p><p>Lawmakers saw that while conventional broadcasting was not
technically equipped to develop vendor-customer relationships with
listeners, webcasting would be in a position to do exactly that.
That's why the CARP Report presumes the existence of a performance
distribution business in which revenues are collected for every
song played for every listener.</p><p>So CARP came up with requirements for record keeping and
per-song/per-listener fees that it felt would be legitimate for a
business whose purpose is to sell inventory and pay upstream
sources for the merchandise. CARP assumes that stations will find
ways to mark up those goods and sell them to listeners&mdash;or to
find some other revenue source, such as advertising.</p><p>Nowhere, from DRPA through CARP, are the lawmaking and
regulatory processes informed by the nature of the Net as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>place</em></span> or a <span   class="emphasis"><em>space</em></span>&mdash;a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>commons</em></span> on which markets for goods might
naturally be built. Instead lawmakers and regulators have only seen
the the Net as a distribution system, differing from airwaves only
in the ability of shippers to say how much goes where, and
therefore to account for it.</p><p>So, armed only with plumbing and shipping metaphors, CARP
tortured itself trying to describe real market relationships. The
groaning starts here:</p><p>In establishing rates and terms for transmissions by eligible
nonsubscription services..., the copyright arbitration royalty
panel shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent
the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the
marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In
determining such rates and terms, the copyright arbitration royalty
panel shall base its decision on economic, competitive and
programming information presented by the parties,
including&mdash;</p><p>(i) whether use of the service may substitute for or may
promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with
or may enhance the sound recording copyright owner's other streams
of revenue from its sound recordings; and</p><p>(ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the
transmitting entity in the copyrighted work and the service made
available to the public with respect to relative creative
contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost,
and risk.</p><p>The statute further directs the Panel to set &ldquo;a minimum fee
for each type of service&rdquo; and grants the Panel discretion to
consider the rates and terms for &ldquo;comparable types of digital audio
transmission services and comparable circumstances under voluntary
license agreements&rdquo; negotiated under the voluntary negotiation
provisions of the statute.</p><p>Later the report says this:</p><p>The meaning of the &ldquo;willing buyer/willing seller&rdquo; standard
was the subject of considerable testimony and argument.</p><p>Here's how the Librarian (of Congress) settled the
argument:</p><p>The statutory standard set forth in section 114(f)(2)(B)
requires the Panel to determine the rates that a willing seller and
a willing buyer would agree upon through voluntary negotiations in
the marketplace. The Panel must use the &ldquo;willing seller/willing
buyer&rdquo; standard to set rates for all non-interactive,
nonsubscription transmissions made under the section 114 license,
including those within 150 miles of the broadcaster's
transmitter.</p><p>It's gets even more complicated than that; but the deep irony
is still easy to make clear: commercial radio has no buyer/seller
relationship between station and listener, &ldquo;willing&rdquo; or otherwise.
That relationship only exists between station and advertiser. In
fact, every commercial station's consumers and customers are
utterly different populations.</p><p>But CARP pressed forward, imagining an entirely new business
that has never existed: <span   class="emphasis"><em>accountable
broadcasting</em></span>. Commercial radio has never had anything
like it, and can barely imagine it. Public broadcasting has
something like this system, but the payments are all voluntary. No
accounting for use by listeners is involved.</p><p>Ironically, the only broadcasters that have ever moved in the
direction CARP imagines are hackers like Bill Goldsmith of Radio
Paradise and KPIG, who have built a remarkable amount of
accountability into their Web-assisted broadcast systems.
Everything either of those stations plays is posted live on the
Web, and scrolls into archives that go back for years. Most
Interent broadcasters also have the interest and will to pay
artists and record producers for the goods. They're starting to
move those intentions toward a real business that makes real money.
Unfortunately, they haven't arrived at that point yet, and they
never will if CARP has its way.</p><p>Of course, that's the hidden agenda.</p><p>If radio ever becomes accountable to its listeners, and the
web waves turn into a real marketplace where everybody&mdash;composers,
recording artists, record companies, stations and listeners&mdash;are
involved and relating directly to each other, the inefficient
advertising-funded industry we call commercial radio is in deep
trouble.</p><p>So there we hae it.</p><p>Cory Doctorow of the EFF
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2002_04_01_archive.html#85047862" target="_self">puts
the problem perfectly</a>:</p><p>The role of the technology industry is to blaze new trails
that create new opportunities for Hollywood. The role of Hollywood
is to seek injunctive relief from those opportunities.</p></div></div>
