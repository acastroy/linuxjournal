    Making progress on the laptop, one utility and one encrypted DVD at a time.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1e298"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Compaq Presario 711 is a nice upgrade
from my 475MHz AMD desktop system. The configuration I recently
bought from Costco.com includes too many features to list here, but
it has more than two times the power that my desktop system has and
includes a FireWire port and an 8x DVD drive. The pre-installed
version of Windows XP wasn't a big selling point for me, though; I
wanted to use Linux on my new laptop.</p><p>Linux has made great progress on desktop systems. Installing
a modern operating system like RH 7.3 on a desktop is almost easy
enough for Aunt Minnie, as Jerry Pournelle likes to call the
everyday computer user. But laptop installs are a different matter.
The hardware on laptops is less generic than what's on the desktop,
but with the move to ATX-style motherboards with integrated
peripherals, this has become less of a problem.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6291f1.large.jpg"><img src="6291f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>The Presario Laptop</p></div></div>
</p><p>The first step toward Linux freedom on my new Presario was a
basic install of Red Hat 7.3. For me this consists of selecting a
laptop install from the friendly GUI installation manager, and then
going through the package list to remove everything but the bare
essentials needed to get X and the development tools up and
running. The only real issue with the installer is that it doesn't
auto-detect the video chipset the Presario has, which is a
variation of the Savage chipset called Savage Twister K. So you
have to manually select &ldquo;Savage&rdquo; from the list of video drivers
presented during the install.</p><p>Once I have the basic setup installed and running
<b  >startx</b> from a shell prompt, giving me a nice
plain X screen, I copy over all the Red Hat CDs to a new directory
named /RPMS/. I find this makes life much easier when I discover
something missing from the system. I can install it in a few
seconds, and I don't have a lot of the extra baggage that modern
distributions bring to clutter up the hard drive. With a 20GB drive
available, there is no reason not to install 2GBs of RPM packages
so that you will always have them available.</p><p>I use Window Maker as my window manager, and I don't install
GNOME or KDE and their associated load of cruft. This has become
somewhat of a crusade for me lately; when I upgrade my hardware I
actually like to see my applications run faster instead of running
bigger applications at the same speed as before (or, in some cases,
slower). I see a strong trend in the GNOME and KDE communities
toward feature bloat, which ends up negating the increases in
processor speed and available RAM.</p><p>But that doesn't mean you have to follow my heretical habits.
One of the greatest benefits of using a liberating operating system
such as Linux, and all of the associated programs, is you can mix
and match the packages to suit your tastes. The changes I am going
to describe will work equally well on a stock GNOME- or KDE-based
Red Hat install, if that's what you use. So, on to the tweaks we
need to make to get your Linux laptop up to snuff.</p><p>One of the first things I'll cover is the fact that the basic
Red Hat 7.3 will install and run on the Presario, but the correct
power management system isn't enabled. The Presario, as well as an
increasing number of newer laptops, uses the ACPI power management
interface instead of the older APM system. Because of this, you
will notice the processor and fan run at full blast, trying to do
their own version of the Chernobyl disaster while sitting on your
lap.</p><p>As I write this on my Presario, it is running X,
OpenOffice.org, the xine DVD player and a number of Window Maker
docking apps. The CPU usage is hovering around 30%, the fan is on
low and the laptop is a comfortable temperature. Without ACPI
working it can get very hot, to the point where it's uncomfortable
to hold it on your lap.</p><p>In addition to power management, the sound card has to be
dealt with, as does one of those wonderful LinModems and the lack
of RS-232 serial ports. As an added bonus, I'll tell you how to
play your favorite DVD movies while still getting work done.</p><p>One subject that I won't cover is software suspend. Patches
are available that are reported to work for some people. I didn't
have any success when I tried applying them to my kernel, and there
were too many differences for me to attempt to hand-patch. Because
of the nature of software suspend, I am reluctant to try and
shoe-horn it into my kernel myself; I'd rather wait until a well
tested version makes its way into the kernel tree.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1e920"></a>Power Management</h2></div></div><p>The most important of the modifications outlined above is
power management. Modern laptops depend on the operating system to
correctly interface with the hardware power management system.
Older laptops used a system called APM, while newer laptops are
starting to use the ACPI system instead. As I mentioned before, the
default Red Hat 7.3 install has APM power management enabled
instead of the ACPI power management system that the Presario uses.
There is an ACPI system included in the 2.4.18-4 kernel, but it is
somewhat outdated and doesn't provide the /proc/acpi interface
required by wmacpi. The latest ACPI patch as of this writing is
acpi-20020726-2.4.18.diff. It provides a better /proc/ interface to
the status of the machine and the state of the battery. This patch
is available from
<a href="http://acpi.sf.net" target="_self">acpi.sf.net</a>, but read on
before you run off and try to patch your kernel.</p><p>As luck would have it the new ACPI patch doesn't apply
cleanly against the Red Hat kernel-source-2.4.18-4 RPM packaged
source tree. A considerable amount of hand-tweaking is needed to
get the kernel to compile correctly after applying the patch. You
also need the kacpi patch, which fixes a problem the Presario has
with losing track of ACPI interrupts. This patch is available from
Juliusz Chroboczek's excellent web page (see Resources). If this
patch isn't included, the kernel will miss interrupts and ACPI
power management will be disabled. I modified the kapcid patch a
bit so that it wouldn't report the missed interrupts&mdash;there were so
many of them that it was filling up my logs.</p><p>Instead of talking you through all the tweaks I made to get
the new version of ACPI working, I have provided a complete patch
that handles all of the issues I cover in this article, which can
be downloaded from my web site at
<a href="http://www.brianlane.com" target="_self">www.brianlane.com</a>.
This patch will apply cleanly against a standard Red Hat 2.4.18-4
kernel tree, so here is how to patch your kernel (it isn't as hard
as you may have been led to believe).</p><p>Let's get started by installing a clean RH 7.3 kernel with
the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uhv kernel-source-2.4.18-4.rpm
cd /usr/src/linux-2.4/
cp configs/kernel-2.4.18-athlon.config .config
</pre><p>Then apply my patch to the kernel tree:</p><p><b  >patch -p1 &lt;
/tmp/2.4.18-4presario.patch</b></p><p>And configure the kernel for ACPI support with <b  >make
xconfig</b>.</p><p>Go to general setup, deselect APM support and select ACPI
support and type <b  >y</b> for all the ACPI options
except &ldquo;CPU Enumeration Only&rdquo;. Save and exit the kernel
configuration, and then build and install the kernel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make dep; make clean; make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
make install
</pre><p>This will create the new kernel, called 2.4.18-4acpi, install
it into /boot, create an initrd and update the bootloader (Grub in
my case).</p><p>If you are feeling adventurous, you can edit /etc/grub.conf
(or LILO, if that's what you're using) and select the new kernel as
the default. But always keep a spare around, just in case. Reboot
your machine, and make sure that there is now a /proc/acpi
directory tree. Look at /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state to see the
current state of your battery. Mine, for example, looks like this
when running from the battery:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            12565 mW
remaining capacity:      47463 mWh
present voltage:         16145 mV
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1f000"></a>Monitoring Battery Levels</h2></div></div><p>I use the Window Maker window manager, so my choice for
battery monitoring is the excellent wmacpi utility from timecop
(see Resources section). It shows the current state of the AC plug,
the battery charge level and a timer that estimates the remaining
time left on the battery. It also reports when the battery is
charging and has a button that switches the display between time
remaining and time on battery. Download it from timecop's web site
and install it like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/src
tar xvzf wmacpi-1.34
cd wmacpi-1.34
./configure
make
make install
cp wmacpi /usr/local/bin/
</pre><p>Launch wmacpi using the Run menu option and drag it over to
the dock. Right click and select Settings... Start when Window
Maker is started so that it will come up every time Window Maker
runs.</p><p>For those of you not using Window Maker, you could use
<a href="http://uname.dyndns.org/~uname/software.php" target="_self">GkACPI</a>
or <a href="http://akpi.scmd.at" target="_self">aKpi</a> to monitor the
status of the battery and its charging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1f2c0"></a>Catching Power Events</h2></div></div><p>ACPI events, like AC power removal, power key presses and lid
closure, can be caught by user-space programs. The acpid program,
available from
<a href="http://acpid.sf.net" target="_self">acpid.sf.net</a>, can connect
these events to the commands you specify, such as system shutdown.
The acpid d&aelig;mon runs in the background, watching
/proc/acpi/events for events that have been linked to actions
specified in the /etc/acpid/events directory. Installations is a
snap if you use the RPM from the acpid web site. After
installation, make sure it is running at power-up with
<b  >chkconfig acpid on; chkconfig --list
acpid</b>.</p><p>I now have my system configured to call shutdown -h when the
power key is pressed, but be careful with this. It will immediately
shut down your system, not leaving you any time to save files or
logout. So if you think you are going to accidentally press power,
it might be a good idea to add a timeout.</p><p>You can also catch lid closure, but there isn't a good way to
differentiate between the open and close events. When I tried
running xlock from the lid event, it ended up running twice because
it catches two events, one when the lid closes and one when the lid
opens.</p><p>To catch power events, add the following file to the
/etc/acpi/events/ directory as a file named power:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
event=button.power.*
action=/sbin/shutdown -h now "%e"
</pre><p>The event entry is a regex to match the event. You can see
these events listed in /var/log/acpid when you do things such as
press the power key or close the lid. You can also catch battery
events. As with lid events, it is hard to tell what the event
signifies without checking the /proc/acpi/ battery state. But a
simple power-down when the battery gets low would look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
event=battery.BAT0.*
action=/sbin/shutdown -h +2 "%e"
</pre><p>This command will shut down the system two minutes after the
first battery event. As the battery gets lower it will emit more
events, so this really ought to call a Perl script that checks the
contents of /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state. But I will leave that as
an exercise for the reader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1f6e0"></a>Sound</h2></div></div><p>The Presario comes with built-in stereo speakers, a headphone
jack and microphone input. The audio system uses an AD1886 AC97,
codec which is supported by the default kernel&mdash;except the driver
included with the kernel doesn't initialize the codec properly, so
there is no sound output. A small patch from Santiago Nullo solves
this problem, and I have included it in the comprehensive Presario
patch available on my web site.</p><p>Red Hat 7.3 correctly detects the sound system and modifies
/etc/modules.conf accordingly, so there is nothing to modify after
rebooting with your new ACPI kernel. You should confirm that sound
is working, though, by running xmms and playing some of your
favorite Ogg Vorbis or MP3 files. Make sure the xmms output plugin
has the OSS driver selected; if it isn't you may end up with a
bunch of .wav files in your home directory.</p><p>I use the wmix docking app that came with Red Hat 7.3 to
control my audio settings from the Window Maker dock. After
installing the supplied RPM it came up with all of the supported
sound card volume settings, some of which I didn't even know it
supported. The master volume level can be controlled by software or
with the hardware +/- keys. Note that the volume settings are
independent, so hitting the hardware keys may jump the volume to an
unexpected level.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1f898"></a>LinModem Support</h2></div></div><p>The modem included with the Presario is a software modem,
requiring a driver in the OS to handle the modem functions instead
of hardware. This used to mean that the modem was useless when
running Linux, but thanks to Mark Boucher there now is a driver
available for the modem. I downloaded the
hsflinmodem-5.03.03.L3mbsibeta02072100-1.i386.rpm file from Mark's
web site (listed in the Resource section at the end of this
article) and installed it with <b  >rpm -Uhv</b>. It
didn't recognize the kernel version I had, so it recompiled itself
after asking a few simple questions (accept the defaults) in a
painless and user-friendly way. Kudos to the authors for putting
together a clean installation module.</p><p>I installed my favorite terminal program, Minicom, which is
included with the Red Hat distribution, and pointed it toward
/dev/modem (is now a symlink to /dev/ttySHSF0). I then tested the
connection by dialing into my home Linux box. The driver uses an
unnoticeable amount of CPU time while active and worked fine for my
experiments. One disappointment is that it responds to the
+FCLASS=? command with a 0, indicating no fax support.</p><p>The driver install tries to autodetect your location based on
the time zone setting and may get your country wrong, as it did in
my case. (I picked Vancouver as the closest choice of cities in the
Red Hat installer's time zone setup dialog). The country can be
changed by running <b  >hsfconfig -country</b> as
root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2b1fb00"></a>Serial Ports</h2></div></div><p>If you haven't been paying attention to recent laptop
designs, you might be surprised to note that most new laptops don't
come with the old DB9 serial ports anymore. All of the new laptops
I looked at are using USB instead of RS-232, and the Presario is no
exception. The Presario does include two USB ports next to the
still-standard 25-pin parallel port. Support for USB works right
out of the box; the kernel autodetects the type of USB hub is use
and loads the correct drivers at power-up without any
intervention.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6291f2.large.jpg"><img src="6291f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The Connectors
</p></div></div><p>You will have to add any users with permission to access the
USB devices to the uucp group by editing /etc/group. Add a
comma-delimited list of the users to the <b  >uucp:</b>
line.</p><p>I have tested the USB port with an Handspring Visor,
hotsyncing it with the USB cradle and pilot-xfer program. This
required manually installing the Visor module using
<b  >modprobe visor</b>. Press the hotsync button on the
Visor cradle and then run <b  >pilot-xfer /dev/ttyUSB1 -b
./backupdir</b> to save the contents of the Visor to the
back-up directory.</p><p>I have also tested the system with a serial port adapter from
<a href="http://www.rabbitsemiconductor.com" target="_self">www.rabbitsemiconductor.com</a>,
I plugged it in, and it was detected by the kernel automagically,
and all the correct modules were loaded. I then ran my DigiTemp
program (after plugging in a DigiTemp temperature sensor kit to the
serial port adapter) and, in under a minute, I was monitoring the
temperature in my lunchbox. For those that are curios, the
temperature reading was 39.7F.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2f18278"></a>FireWire</h2></div></div><p>The FireWire port is a higher speed serial interface for
connecting multimedia devices like digital video cameras. I don't
have anything with FireWire, so I was unable to test this port.
Support for it is in the kernel, however, so it may work as easily
as USB did.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2f18380"></a>Special Keys</h2></div></div><p>The Presario 711CL includes a number of special keys that are
used under Windows to directly launch programs. An Info button,
Email button, Search Button, Music button and volume control +/-
keys surround the power key. There is also a four-direction key
that looks like it would be useful for scrolling. The volume
control buttons work without any effort. I think they are
hard-wired into the sound system; they seem to independently adjust
the master volume level.</p><p>I have not been able to figure out how to use these
additional keys. They aren't reported by the ACPI system like the
power and lid switches are, and when I run
<b  >showkey</b> they don't emit any key codes. The
special windows keys do show up as key code 125, 126 and 127 for
the left window key, right window key and menu key
respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2f18538"></a>Temperature Sensors</h2></div></div><p>It seems to me that the laptop ought to have an accessible
temperature sensor in it somewhere. The Presario uses the VIA686a
ISA bridge chipset, which is supported in the lm-sensors package.
But after patching the kernel (by hand yet again), it couldn't find
any sensors attached to the VIA686a. I have left this patch out of
my collection, because it doesn't add anything useful to this
laptop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2f18640"></a>Playing DVDs</h2></div></div><p>And the last item on that list I mentioned at the beginning
of this article is playing DVDs&mdash;even all of those encrypted DVDs
on your bookshelf can be played. Oooh, I said it, didn't I; that
taboo word&mdash;encrypted. Yes, it is possible, even easy, to play your
DVDs under Linux, and there isn't a thing that any court in the
world can do about it. Hopefully they don't come chasing after me
for telling you which web sites have the CSS decoder software
available.</p><p>Because of my simplified install, the RPM for xine wouldn't
install without adding a whole load of things I really don't need
on this system. So I first downloaded the RPMs from the
<a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd" target="_self">Ogle web
site</a> and installed them. The Ogle web site includes links
to all the packages you need to install to get DVD playback working
on your system. The web site also has links to the source for all
the packages they recommend, so you can recompile from source if
the RPMs have too many dependencies.</p><p>Make a symlink from /dev/hdc to /dev/dvd, and then run
<b  >ogle</b> from the command line. You should see your
movie begin playing, but it will probably look choppy. The default
Red Hat install doesn't turn on DMA transfers for the DVD drive, so
it isn't transferring data as quickly and efficiently as it could.
Don't worry, there's a fix for this too. Copy the
/etc/sysconfig/harddisks file to /etc/sysconfig/harddiskhdc and
edit it. Change the line <b  >USE_DMA=1</b> to enable DMA
transfers on this drive. You may want to do the same thing for hda,
creating a file named harddiskhda. You can reboot to make sure this
takes effect, or you can run the hdparm utility to turn on DMA
access:</p><p><b  >hdparm -d 1 /dev/dvd</b></p><p>Now try running Ogle again. Playback should look smooth, and
the terminal window shouldn't be complaining about dropped
frames&mdash;at least not very often.</p><p>The Ogle player also has some problems with audio
synchronization. It sometimes looks as if the audio is lagging
behind the video playback, and the terminal window will sometimes
report that it is resynchronizing the audio.</p><p>The xine player works better, and the audio is synched
correctly, but it was a bit of a chore for me to install it on my
stripped down system. If you are running GNOME, it is an easy task
to install the associated RPMs from
<a href="http://xine.sf.net" target="_self">xine.sf.net</a>. If you want to
play encrypted DVDs (why else would you have a DVD player?), then
you also need the libdvdcss library and the dvdnav plugin for menu
support. See the Resources section for the web sites.</p><p>In my case I downloaded the source for all of this and
compiled and installed it. The only glitch I ran into was that the
libdvdread was hard-coded to look for the libdvdcss.so.1 library,
but I had version 2.0 installed. This is easily corrected by
editing the libdvdread-0.9.2/dvdread/dvd_setup.c file, replacing
the occurrences of libdvdcss.so.1 with libdvdcss.so.2. No other
changes are needed, and this may be fixed in newer versions of
libdvdread.</p><p>After installing libdvdread, libdvdcss, libdvdnav,
xine-dvdnav,xine-lib and xine-ui, you should have a working DVD
player. When you run xine for the first time, run it as
<b  >xine -V XShm</b> to ensure that it doesn't use the
xv display calls. This will save the preferences to the ~/.xine/
directory so that you don't need to do this every time. If you
forget to do this, it will attempt to use xv and will completely
lock up the laptop. Then you'll have to pull the power plug and
remove the battery in order to reboot. Yes, it is possible to
hard-lock a Linux system; it usually only happens to me when
dealing with X.</p><p>My experience with the Presario laptop has demonstrated how
far Linux has advanced from the first time I downloaded the SLS
distribution, and how far it still has to go before it can gain
even as much desktop share as the Mac OS. The good news is that it
is possible to successfully install it on the Presario and take
advantage of all the features of that laptop. I'd like to thank the
authors of all the programs that I have discussed for their efforts
to advance the state of the art for Linux. Especially useful was
Juliusz Chroboczek Presario 711 web page, where I learned about the
kapcid patch and the sound card patch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a26580.0x2f18c70"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>Juliusz Chroboczek's
