the complete version of the article by the same title that appears
in the November 2002 issue of</em></span> <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Deep inside the warm green interior of Guinea, centered in
the frontal lobe of West Africa, field personnel in the widely
scattered village-towns of Dabola, Kissidougou and Nzerekore now
enjoy access to regular internet e-mail, directly from their
desktops. Here we have bridged the digital divide, and there isn't
a telephone line or satellite dish in sight. Instead we are moving
the mail over distances of hundreds of miles&mdash;over jungled
mountains and high palmy savannahs&mdash;through wavelengths of
high-frequency (HF) radio. Our project is called Radio E-mail, and
here is its story.</p><p>The Republic of Guinea is a cashew-shaped nation with
Atlantic view property, 10 degrees north of the equator in west
West Africa. It is a beautiful and resource-rich nation, with an
total land area about the size of Oregon. As far as African
countries go, Guinea is a calm pocket of peace and stability, and
it generally doesn't attract a lot of attention from beyond its own
borders.</p><p>But Guinea has quietly played a heroic role in the theater of
world events in recent years. It provides a safe and welcome refuge
for as many as half a million people displaced by brutal wars and
civil upheavals in the neighboring countries of Sierra Leone and
Liberia.</p><p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has one of their
largest operations in Guinea, providing services and support to a
population of up to 200,000 refugees quartered in many camps
established throughout the country. I became involved with IRC when
my wife accepted the position of Country Director for the program
in the summer of 2001. Soon we were traveling on an inspection tour
of the camps, making the long road-trip to visit the program's
three field offices up-country. Our first destination was a distant
and dusty village, delightfully named Kissidougou&mdash;frequently
called Kissi in the local vernacular.</p><p>Traveling outside the capital city of Conakry, one
immediately finds that Guinea has little infrastructure, especially
in the way of electrical grid and telecommunication systems&mdash;to say
nothing of Starbucks and broadband access to the internet. So IRC
field offices must provide their own infrastructure: diesel
generators for electricity and high-frequency (HF), two-way radio
sets to communicate with other offices and mobile units, up to
hundreds of miles apart.</p><p>Expecting this isolation and general lack of connectivity, I
was quite astonished when we arrived in Kissi. Here I found the
radio operator using his equipment to make a binary file transfer
from his desktop PC to another field office, wirelessly!</p><p>This capability surprised and intrigued me. On top of the
operator's radio set, connected to the serial port of his PC, sat a
dingy black box simply labeled 9002 HF Data Modem. I noticed the
operator used a proprietary, MS-DOS program to make his file
transfers, but I immediately began wondering: if this device is
truly some kind of modem, moving binary data over the ether of
radio, why couldn't we set it up with Linux and network with PPP
connections as well?</p><p>After a little research and testing, I soon confirmed this
equipment could indeed form the basis of a wide area network,
providing full access to internet e-mail via the Conakry office for
all personnel in each of the three field offices. Moreover, since
IRC owned most of the equipment already&mdash;and since we would be
using Linux and other freely available, open-source software&mdash;the
system could be implemented at negligible cost, with no increase in
operating expenses. For the price of some network cards and
category 5 cable, we could connect our bush offices to the rest of
the world. I developed a design and specification for the system,
and the project we call Radio E-mail has been continuously
operational since January 2002.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x15796b8"></a>HF Goes the Distance</h2></div></div><p>If you have been making the move to wireless lately, most
likely you are working with the microwave, high bandwidth
frequencies of 802.11b. If so, you know that on a clear day you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>maybe</em></span> can get a line-of-sight connection out
10 miles or so. That surely won't do for the vast distances and
wild terrain we need to cover in rural Africa.</p><p>HF radio is another animal. Its longer waves roll out across
the landscape, reflecting off the ionosphere to follow the
curvature of the earth. This gives HF signals a range in the
hundreds of miles. From Conakry to Nzerekore&mdash;IRC Guinea's most
distant field office&mdash;HF easily covers a straight-line distance of
over 375 miles (600 kilometers.) The road that sometimes connects
these two points is, of course, much longer&mdash;a gut-slamming,
spine-jamming, two-day punishment for the damned.</p><p>So the great advantage of HF is it can go the distance,
leaping the obstacles in its path with aplomb. Now for the bad
news: where HF wins the wireless game in range, it loses its pants
in data capacity. If 802.11b is considered broadband, think of HF
as slim-to-none-band. The radio modems we are using here are speced
at an anorexic 2400 baud!</p><p>And wait, it gets worse. Two-way radio is the classic
half-duplex medium of communication; that is, you are either
transmitting&mdash;push to talk&mdash;or receiving, not both at the same
time. This, plus the robust error-checking protocols implemented by
the modem hardware itself, means the actual link experience is more
on the order of 300 baud. Does anyone remember 300 baud? Unless you
measure your patience with radio-carbon, your dreams of remote
login sessions will be dashed and splattered. As for on-line
browsing, chat, video-conferencing and the like, well, best to not
even think about it.</p><p>Yet for classic store-and-forward applications like
text-based e-mail, the bandwidth limitation of HF radio is
workable. We simply need to pay close attention to our
configuration and try to optimize as much as possible. With HF
radio, every packet is precious.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1579978"></a>Radio Network Topology</h2></div></div><p>Given these capabilities and limitations of HF, our design
strategy for the project uses radio modems in a topology among
field offices, as shown in the reference network of Figure 1. In
Conakry we have a full-time internet gateway on the host coyah. The
radio modem on the host congo serves as the dial-in hub for each of
the three field offices. We establish periodic PPP links between
the field and Conakry and use our choice of carefully selected
client-server protocols over TCP/IP. Although we might have
implemented e-mail to the field using UUCP, our TCP/IP system is
easier to configure and integrate with the existing network and
e-mail system. This setup is also readily converted to use faster
telecommunications linkups, such as through landlines or
satellites. If and when these become available in the field (and as
the budget may support them), the IRC network is ready to simply
plug in.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6299f1.large.jpg"><img src="6299f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Radio Network Topology</p></div></div><p>For now, though, we don't have the luxury of dedicating our
radios to full-time connections for data communications. In fact,
voice communication continues to be the central purpose of the
radio equipment, providing an essential lifeline for the safety and
security of field office and mobile unit personnel. Our
implementation and procedures must supplement this lifeline, not
impair it. Since data sessions over the radio block voice calls at
each end of the link, we have policies and configurations to hold
connections to less than 15 minutes per session. Otherwise, we keep
the radios free for voice contact. In the field, radio operators
have procedural protocols for making their periodic dial-up
connections with Conakry for e-mail exchange at regular intervals
throughout the day. A schedule is established for these transfers,
but radio operators still maintain the latitude to adjust the
schedule and break sessions as necessary to accommodate urgent
voice communications. For these reasons, all dial-ups are
necessarily under the control of the radio operators, rather than
set up with cron jobs or diald, as we might do in other, better
connected circumstances.</p><p>The equipment used in this project is made by Codan, an
Australian manufacturer of two-way radio hardware. Although there
are other manufacturers&mdash;including Motorola, Kenwood and
Yaesu&mdash;Codan seems to be the radio of choice for international aid
organizations in this part of the world. Wherever expats gather,
you will see their big white Landcruisers with official markings
and the substantial Codan whip antennas bolted conspicuously to
every front bumper. While emphatically robust and utilitarian, the
symbolic authoritative value of these thick black whips&mdash;such as
when crossing the many and potentially intimidating military
checkpoints&mdash;is certainly their most dominant feature.</p><p><a href="6299s1.html" target="_self">Codan Modem Tips and
Traps</a></p><p>The modem used in this project is the 9002 model. (Believe it
or not, Codan also makes a 2400 baud fax modem, model 9001. We
found a used one on the local market for $500.) These modems are
equipped with a basic Hayes-like AT command set, so they are easy
to configure, operate and trouble-shoot with any telecommunications
application available for Linux, such as Minicom or Kermit.</p><p>There are some significant differences between this modem and
that Sportster you may have jacked to your phone line, however. For
one thing, the Codan unit is actually built as DTE (data terminal
equipment), rather than DCE (data communication equipment). To
connect it to your serial port, you need a special DB-9 null modem
cable, wired exactly as diagrammed in David Lawler's
&ldquo;Text-Terminal-HOWTO&rdquo;. Since not all cables described as null modem
are wired the same, this detail is crucial. Also, the AT commands
are not as extensive as, and vary slightly from, those you would
expect to find on your standard USR model. And, of course, this
modem moves data much more slowly than you can possibly imagine.
The dripping of a famous-brand ketchup comes to mind, after
refrigeration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1579e48"></a>Configuring mgetty and PPP</h2></div></div><p>Returning to the network setup, the Conakry radio host
congo&mdash;aliased as radiohub&mdash;is configured as a PPP server, ready
to accept dial-in connections over the radio from offices in the
field. As with a conventional telephone dial-in configuration, we
use mgetty to watch the serial line, initialize the modem, wait for
incoming calls, answer the RING and fire off the PPP daemon.</p><p>The 9002 works pretty much as mgetty expects, and the sample
mgetty.config file (Listing 1) shows how to do it. The comments in
the listing describe the key settings. The most important line in
this file is the modem initialization string given by the init-chat
parameter. Here we start by setting the modem to a known state with
the factory defaults (AT&amp;F) and then get defensively redundant:
set all command, local and remote echo off (E0 L0 R0); ignore
carrier (X0); use hardware flow control (&amp;K3); auto-answer off
(S0=0 &amp;A=0); and reset the station address (&amp;I=nnnn, where
nnnn is like a phone number, the unique identifier that other
radios call to reach this particular station.)</p><p><a href="6299l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
mgetty.config</a></p><p>After mgetty answers the RING and gets a CONNECT back from
the the other end, then what? This is controlled by mgetty's
login.conf file (Listing 2). It is common in dial-in systems to let
mgetty look for incoming PPP packets and then start the PPP daemon
automagically, typically using CHAP in the link negotiation process
for authentication. Such a configuration is handled by the line
starting with the magic string /AutoPPP/.</p><p><a href="6299l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. login.conf</a></p><p>In our experience, though, the high latency of the radio link
makes an /AutoPPP/ configuration slow to kick in. So what we do
instead will be shocking: we dispense with conventional
authentication entirely! In our configuration, the login name
provided by the chat script of the incoming connection is used to
start the PPP daemon directly. When mgetty matches a login name
with an entry in the first field of the login.conf file, such as
Pklogin, it then runs the program specified in the fourth field,
such as /usr/local/sbin/pppd.login.kenya. In essence, then, the
login name used by the remote system serves to control access. Note
that Pklogin is bogus as a system account, and you can be sure I
haven't told you the string we are really using! (Note also that we
have an implicit system of human authentication even before a
connection is made, when operators agree by voice to lock on a
specific channel before starting the link.)</p><p>When mgetty gets a login name listed in the login.conf file,
it then passes control to the corresponding start-up script, such
as pppd.login.kenya (Listing 3). This in turn starts the PPP
daemon, using an options file for the particular remote host, such
as options.kenya (Listing 4).</p><p><a href="6299l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
pppd.login.kenya</a></p><p><a href="6299l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
options.kenya</a></p><p>Here you may want to spare yourself bitter trails of sweat,
tears and other emotional excretions, and pay attention to the
lcp-restart and ipcp-restart options. These parameters give the
time, in seconds, that pppd will wait to receive a reply to that
particular phase of PPP negotiation before trying again. The
default value of these parameters is three seconds, which is
generally more than adequate when using regular telecommunications
and is probably why you have never encountered these options before
now.</p><p>Over the radio, though, if these restart defaults are not
extended, you'll only snag yourself a useless snarling hairball.
Here's what happens. As pppd starts up, each peer begins a
negotiation process with the other to agree on all parameters for
the connection. During these initial discussions, when one end of
the link doesn't hear back from the other within its restart
interval, pppd repeats the transmission. In the meantime, though,
the remote end <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> received the original
transmission and sends back its reply. The local end gets this
response back to its first transmission, thinking it has a proper
response to its second, and so proceeds to the next step of
negotiation. But then the local server gets what is now the
unexpected response back from its <span   class="emphasis"><em>second</em></span>
transmission, and the negotiations break down in unresolved
chaos.</p><p>By extending the lcp-restart and ipcp-restart parameters, you
can delay sending out the repeat transmissions for a sufficient
amount of time for the peers at each end to receive a response.
Almost always the remote end will receive and reply to every
original phase negotiation request, but the round-trip time can
take several seconds. Here we have configured a generous 16 second
delay and never have any more problems.</p><p>Turning our attention up-country, each remote host in the
field is configured to dial-up the radio server in Conakry, using
PPP configurations corresponding to those shown in Listings 5 - 8
for the kenya host in Kissidougou. These reflect the key
configuration issues as already discussed for the server, such as
the crucial modem initialization string (Listing 8) and the
essential options for pppd (Listing 6).</p><p><a href="6299l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. ppp.start</a></p><p><a href="6299l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.

a happy and amazing day when we finally got our first link across
radio waves spreading invisibly through the Guinean atmosphere.
From kenya we actually made ssh connections with congo, just to
express our exuberance over talk sessions with the radio operators
watching their terminal screen in Conakry: &ldquo;Greetings from
Kissi!&rdquo;</p><p>With the configuration details finally worked out, we found
the PPP link, although slow, would come up reliably and remain
stable at all times of the day, even over channels which otherwise
sounded fuzzy. Of course, all radios and antennas should be tuned
for their best performance. But once you establish a link, it is
reassuring to find the radio modems are quite capable of
maintaining it, even when conditions are less than optimal. Because
somehow conditions always have a way of being less than
optimal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157a8f0"></a>qmail in the Bush</h2></div></div><p>Here in West Africa, it seems nearly everything just barely
hangs together with bent nails and spit. While this is a tribute to
the resourcefulness and ingenuity of Guineans in the face of
scarcity, darn if this doesn't make a rough neighborhood for
hardware and networks. I have found power cords hacked apart and
spliced together with scotch tape, motherboards rigged in place
with twist ties and wedges of cardboard. It is forever hot, dusty,
buggy and humid. Generators go out, plugs get kicked, lightning
strikes, nothing is grounded. In short, we face the harshest of
environments in trying to implement high-tech reliably.</p><p>For these reasons alone, we would probably use Dan
Bernstein's outstandingly robust qmail tools to move the mail.
qmail is designed with particular attention to reliability, making
sure messages are safely written to disk at each stage of
processing. If a message is handled by qmail&mdash;especially when
delivered to a Maildir, the special mailbox directory format
developed by Bernstein&mdash;you can be sure that message is well and
truly delivered. Otherwise, the mail always remains safely queued
on disk for delivery at a later time. This feature is essential for
the frequent power and network disruptions we face in the African
environment.</p><p>Going beyond qmail's core reliability, Bernstein also has
developed a number of special purpose tools and applications
perfectly suited to the Radio E-mail project. Central among these,
qmail includes a QMTP server, implementing Bernstein's own Quick
Mail Transport Protocol. QMTP is accessible from the serialmail
package, a supplemental suite of programs designed specifically by
Bernstein for moving mail over slow dial-up connections. And our
connections would certainly qualify as slow! By using qmail, QMTP
and serialmail&mdash;controlling the entire chain of e-mail delivery
within our own network&mdash;we have an optimal solution for moving mail
as efficiently and reliably as possible over HF radio.</p><p>As shown on the reference network in Figure 1, qmail runs on
no less than five hosts: the central mail server coyah, the radio
hub server congo and each of the three field office hosts. That's a
lot of qmail! In fact, our production network adds a sixth qmail
installation on a separate gateway/firewall system. This is
configured with what is known as a mini-qmail system, using
Bernstein's Quick Mail Queuing Protocol (QMQP) to queue incoming
mail through the firewall directly to the mailhub host coyah. Table
1 shows the qmail components installed on each of these different
systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157ab00"></a>qmail components</h2></div></div><div class="table"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157abb0"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>gateway/firewall</p></td><td><p>mailhub</p></td><td><p>radiohub</p></td><td><p>fieldhost</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>qmail-smtpd</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>qmail-qmqpc</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>qmail-qmqpd</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>qmail-qmtpd</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>qmail-pop3d</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>fastforward</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>serialmail</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>daemontools</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ucspi-tcpi</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>djbdns</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>qturn</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Y</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>With so many qmail servers to install and configure, you
intimately become acquainted with all things qmail; it is a
wonderfully capable and flexible system. See the Resources for some
pointers, and prepare to spend some time with The Big Qmail
Picture, Bernstein's FAQ documentation and the PIC files. All
installations follow Dave Sill's &ldquo;Life with qmail&rdquo; instructions to
the letter, the indispensable guide for setting up production qmail
systems. The discussion that follows here assumes familiarity with
qmail and its ways: its control files, the special user alias the
qmail virtual domain mechanism, dot-qmail delivery instructions and
Maildir mailbox delivery.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1b02c10"></a>Bound for Kissi</h2></div></div><p>For the e-mail examples given in this article, we'll use the
nonexistent refugee.ngo domain to represent IRC-Guinea's actual
domain of irc.org.gn. Each user on the IRC-Guinea network, whether
in Conakry or a field office, is assigned an e-mail address of the
form firstname.lastname@refugee.ngo. All mail addressed to the
domain refugee.ngo is processed by the mailhub host and routed as
necessary from there. No sender needs to know anything about a
user's particular location of assignment or otherwise use any
special form of addressing.</p><p>To show how this can be done with qmail, let's first consider
a message arriving (or originating) in Conakry for
rhonda.rabbit@refugee.ngo, a user who happens to be posted to the
field in Kissidougou. The key processing steps are sketched in
Figure 2 and described in more detail below.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6299f2.large.jpg"><img src="6299f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Radio E-mail to
Kissidougou</p></div></div><p>On the mailhub server coyah, qmail finds the domain
refugee.ngo in its locals control file and attempts to deliver the
message locally, that is, to a user account on the host coyah.
First it checks for a user named rhonda.rabbit in the system
/etc/passwd database. When qmail fails to find the user there, it
turns the message over to the special alias user, processing it in
accordance with the instructions in
/var/qmail/alias/.qmail-default. Here we have installed the
fastforward command, directing a lookup in a central database built
from the file /etc/aliases. Now an entry is found for
rhonda.rabbit, and the e-mail message is returned to qmail with a
new envelope address of
rhonda.rabbit@kissidougou.refugee.ngo.</p><p>Still on coyah, qmail now does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> find
kissidougou.refugee.ngo in either its locals or virtualdomains
control files, so it queues the message for remote delivery. But
before qmail tries to find an MX record with a name server lookup
for the kissidougou.refugee.ngo domain, which does not exist, it
checks in the smtproutes control file and finds a match. In this
way all mail destined for kissidougou.refugee.ngo, as well as for
all other remote offices, is relayed directly to the radiohub host.
(The smtproutes mechanism helps us avoid the complication of
setting up and delegating a number of subdomains and MX records in
our local nameserver.)</p><p>When the message arrives at the radio hub congo, qmail won't
find the domain kissidougou.refugee.ngo in the locals control file.
In fact the radiohub may be configured without a locals control
file. Instead qmail finds a match in its virtualdomains control
file. The matching entry in the file
kissidougou.refugee.ngo:qturn-kissidougou instructs qmail to
forward all messages addressed to the virtual domain
kissidougou.refugee.ngo, prepending the string qturn-kissidougou-
to the original envelope address. In the case of our example
message then, the address is now rewritten as
qturn-kissidougou-rhonda.rabbit@kissidougou.refugee.ngo and
delivered locally to user qturn.</p><p>qturn is a special user account we have set up on the radio
hub congo, with a home directory of /var/qmail/qturn, to receive
all mail destined for delivery to remote offices via HF radio
modem. Following qmail's dot-qmail conventions, qmail looks in
qturn's home directory for local delivery instructions in
/var/qmail/qturn/.qmail-kissidougou. Our instructions here tell
qmail to deliver to the Maildir mailbox ./kissidougou/.QMAIL.PPP/.
(Similarly for messages destined for Dabola, for example, the
dot-qmail file ~/.qmail-dabola will instruct delivery to the
Maildir mailbox ./dabola/.QMAIL.PPP/.)</p><p>qmail now considers the message delivered. It is out of the
qmail queuing mechanism, and no further delivery or forwarding
attempts are made autonomously.</p><p>Instead, we wait for the next PPP connection with the remote
host kenya in Kissidougou. Then we can make use of the serialmail
package to blast&mdash;relatively speaking&mdash;all the mail collected in
the /var/qmail/qturn/kissidougou/.QMAIL.PPP/ mailbox across the
link using QMTP. The command sequence that sends the collected mail
over the link is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  # cd /var/qmail/qturn/kissidougou
  # maildirqmtp  .QMAIL.PPP  qturn-kissidougou-  10.0.10.243
</pre><p>The first argument to maildirqmtp is the path to the Maildir
directory with the mail we want to transfer. The third argument is
the IP address of the destination qmail-qmtpd server, in this case
the static IP address we have assigned to the Kissi end of the PPP
connection.</p><p>The purpose of the second argument may be less obvious. It
provides the prepended string which should be removed from the
envelope address on each message. Recall that the local part of the
example message address has been rewritten as
qturn-kissidougou-rhonda.rabbit. When maildirqmtp sends this
message, the prepended qturn-kissidougou- is stripped off, and the
envelope address is written once again as
rhonda.rabbit@kissidougou.refugee.ngo.</p><p>The message then wings its way over Guinea, lofting through
African skies on gossamer currents of HF ether, coming gently
alight upon the Kissi radio aerial after a long and spectacular
journey. Here the qmail system on kenya may now complete its
delivery.</p><p>Again qmail first checks its locals control file and does
find kissidougou.refugee.ngo among the entries, since here is where
we want local delivery of the message. Although there is no user
named rhonda.rabbit in kenya's /etc/passwd file, the fastforward
lookup in /etc/aliases does find a match and sets up delivery of
the message to the user account of rrabbit. The dot-qmail delivery
instructions in /home/rrabbit/.qmail&mdash;as for all users set up to
receive POP3 e-mail&mdash;is configured to deliver to the Maildir
mailbox named ./.QMAIL.POP/ in the user's home directory.</p><p>By a happy coincidence, we have configured qmail's POP3
daemon to deliver mail from Maildirs named .QMAIL.POP in users'
home directories. With her laptop connected to the local network in
Kissidougou, eagerly awaiting word from the world beyond, Ms.
Rabbit is now at last greeted with the joyous chimes of its
arrival, &ldquo;You have mail.&rdquo; Radio E-mail works: they laughed, they
cried, they danced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1b033a0"></a>Out of Kissi</h2></div></div><p>Sometime sooner than later, users in Kissidougou will want to
try sending their own messages to others. If you have followed
along with qmail this far, you may already have some ideas for
getting mail back out from the field to any address on the
internet. But it turns out there are a couple of tricky parts in
sending e-mail from Kissidougou to other refugee.ngo users outside
of Kissidougou, whether in Conakry or another field office. Figure
3. considers the case of sending a message from Kissidougou to a
user in Conakry, addressed to lois.lion@refugee.ngo.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6299f3.large.jpg"><img src="6299f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Radio E-mail from
Kissidougou</p></div></div><p>In Kissidougou as in Conakry, we want to keep the convention
of addressing mail to users with firstname.lastname@refugee.ngo, no
matter where the recipient is actually assigned. This means that
refugee.ngo also must be listed in the locals control file on
kenya, so qmail will accept and deliver mail originating on the
local network in Kissi and addressed to recipients posted there.
This avoids the delay and extra traffic of an unnecessary round
trip to the mailhub in Conakry.</p><p>The question, then, is how to forward mail addressed to users
at refugee.ngo, but who are not found locally. The first part of
the solution is to set up fastforward in pass through mode by using
the -p switch. With this option, if a user isn't found in the
/etc/aliases database on kenya, fastforward exits 0, allowing the
message to be processed by further instructions in the alias
.qmail-default file.</p><p>Which brings us to the second part of the solution. As shown
in the diagram, the second line in this file</p><p><b  >|forward
${LOCAL}@mailhub.refugee.ngo</b></p><p>uses qmail's forward utility to send any message to a
refugee.ngo addressee not found locally, rewriting the domain part
of the address as mailhub.refugee.ngo. In our example, the envelope
address is rewritten as lois.lion@mailhub.refugee.ngo and returns
to qmail further processing.</p><p>Again qmail checks the locals control file, and this time
finds no entry for mailhub.refugee.ngo. But now there is a matching
entry in the virtualdomains control file. This particular entry,
with the first field empty, is a form of qmail wildcard expression
and has the effect of treating any domain as a virtual domain. In
this case the entry</p><p><b  >:qrelay-ppp</b></p><p>tells qmail to forward all messages for any domain to the
user qrelay, prepending the string qrelay-ppp- to the original
address. Now our outbound message will be addressed to
qrelay-ppp-lois.lion@mailhub.refugee.ngo. (And any other
internet-bound addresses would be rewritten likewise, such as
qrelay-ppp-guinix@yahoo.com.)</p><p>Similar to the user qturn on the radiohub congo, qrelay is a
special user account we set up on all field hosts, such as kenya,
to receive all mail destined for outgoing delivery via HF radio
modem. The qrelay user has a home directory of /var/qmail/qrelay,
and the dot-qmail instructions in its ~/.qmail-ppp tell qmail to
deliver to the Maildir mailbox ./.QMAIL.PPP/. Here the messages for
all outbound mail will collect until our next PPP link over the
radio. Then we will again use QMTP and serialmail, this time in the
other direction.</p><p>When the link is up, the command sequence that sends the
batch of collected mail to the radiohub in Conakry is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  # cd /var/qmail/qrelay
  # maildirqmtp  .QMAIL.PPP  qrelay-ppp-  10.0.10.241
</pre><p>As in the previous example, the first argument to maildirqmtp
is the path to the Maildir directory containing all outgoing mail.
The third argument is the IP address assigned to the radiohub end
of the PPP connection. And the second argument is the prepended
string to remove from each envelope address. Now when maildirqmtp
sends the example message, it will be restored to
lois.lion@mailhub.refugee.ngo. (And any e-mail to guinix would be
restored to guinix@yahoo.com.)</p><p>Bounding wirelessly out of Kissi, following rainbows and hot
harmattans, the message gracefully traverses the wilds and dangers
of earthly terrain to arrive safely in Conakry on the radiohub
congo. And here it won't linger. When qmail doesn't find any
matching entry in the locals control file, it immediately queues
the message for remote delivery. The entry in the smtproutes
control file then has the wildcard effect of relaying the messages
destined for any domain back to the mailhub server. This
configuration purposely segregates the radiohub host as a server
only for HF links, while using the mailhub host for all other
e-mail services and administration.</p><p>When qmail receives the message on coyah, it now finds an
entry in the locals control file for mailhub.refugee.ngo and
initiates local delivery. In what by now should be a familiar
sequence, fastforward matches lois.lion in the /etc/aliases
database and passes the message for delivery to the llion user
account. The message is then delivered to llion's POP3 mailbox, the
Maildir named ./.QMAIL.POP/. Hungry for word from Ms. Rabbit in the
field, Ms. Lion pounces on her mouse&mdash;and lo the message is
deposited right to her own desktop.</p><p>What if lois.lion is reassigned to the field office in
Nzerekore? The administrator would make the change in mailhub's
/etc/aliases file and run the fastforward version of the newaliases
command to update the fastforward database. Now qmail will turn
messages for lois.lane around for delivery to
lois.lane@nzerekore.refugee.ngo via HF radio, as in the
rhonda.rabbit example. In this way Conakry serves as the central
hub for all e-mail traffic, and field offices need never make links
with one another directly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1b03c38"></a>Operator Interface and qturn</h2></div></div><p>Each of the radio e-mail servers in the field run headless,
controlled from a simple command-line interface via Telnet session
from the operator's desktop PC. The basic interface consists of
four commands, usually run in the following sequence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  ppp.start
  mail.get
  mail.send
  ppp.stop
</pre><p>Simple shell scripts perform their respective tasks, each
providing the operator with a modest amount of feedback about what
is happening at the time. The functions could be further collected
into a single command, such as mail.run, but we want to enable the
operator to maintain some discretion over radio access, depending
on the demands for voice communication. For example, if getting the
mail takes more than 15 minutes or so, the operator may stop the
session, reestablish voice communications for a security check,
then start a separate session a few minutes later to send outbound
mail.</p><p>The command interface shows that we don't try to get and send
mail simultaneously. Rather, first we do one, then the other. This
is another accommodation for the anemic, half-duplex bandwidth of
the HF radio link. As far as network traffic goes, this link is
like a one-lane backroad. More than a little traffic creates a long
skinny parking lot.</p><p>It should be pretty easy to figure out that the mail.send
script is a simple wrapper around the maildirqmtp command described
in the second example. What may be less obvious is how we get the
mail. That is, how do operators in the field run the maildirqmtp
command on the radiohub server in Conakry?</p><p>As with most things UNIX, TMTOWTDI. You may choose, for
example, to set up ssh for remote execution of the maildirqmtp
command shown in the example. Alternatively, you could just go
ahead and set up a POP3 server on the radiohub and use fetchmail
over the link (with the&mdash;qvirtual option to strip the prefix added
to each envelope's address), though you would then lose the
benefits of QMTP.</p><p>For the Radio E-mail project, we decided to take advantage of
Dan Bernstein's daemontools and ucspi-tcpi packages, already
installed as part of our standard Life with qmail installation. The
tools in these packages make it ridiculously easy to set up special
purpose servers. Ours is called qturn and is modeled on Bernstein's
AutoTURN comments described in the documentation with his
serialmail package. With qturn we keep the significant efficiencies
of QMTP, while avoiding the time-consuming overhead involved in
establishing and authenticating an ssh connection.</p><p>The components of the qturn server running on the radiohub
are provided in Listings 9 - 11. The principle is simple. The qturn
run script (Listing 9) is set up as a daemontools service listening
on a specific port of your choosing (here we use 55210). Anytime a
connection to the port is made, the qturnd.sh script (Listing 11)
is executed. This script reads the $TCPREMOTE environmental
variable passed to it by the tcpserver invocation and gets the
static IP address we have assigned to the incoming connection. The
script then matches this IP address to the Maildir directory used
for that field office. The maildirqmtp command is then run, sending
the collected mail in the Maildir to the QMTP server on the remote
host, while directing status output to filehandles that can be read
by the client process.</p><p><a href="6299l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9. qturn.run</a></p><p><a href="6299l10.html" target="_self">Listing 10.
qturn_log.run</a></p><p><a href="6299l11.html" target="_self">Listing 11.
qturnd.sh</a></p><p>Now the mail.get script on the client is simple, as is shown
in Listing 12. It calls tcpclient to connect to the qturn server
created with tcpserver on the radiohub and redirects the stream
returned from that process to standard output. That's it!
Client/server programming just doesn't get any easier.</p><p><a href="6299l12.html" target="_self">Listing 12. mail.get</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1b042c0"></a>An Algorithm for Africa</h2></div></div><p>As we may have mentioned, the HF radio link is a tad on the
slow side. Yet we do manage to move a decent amount of mail with it
nonetheless. On an average day, over 300 messages travel the
airwaves between Conakry and field offices, over two to three brief
connections per office. And as is typical with all internet
technologies, every taste stimulates even greater appetite.</p><p>Given the limitations inherent in radio e-mail, we try to
maintain a usage policy that is as open as possible. For example,
staff are free to use radio e-mail for personal correspondence with
friends and family anywhere in the world, and there is no limit to
the number of messages any user may send. Our only explicit policy
restriction is the request that users not subscribe to mailing
lists.</p><p>To prevent the radio links from getting choked-up for hours
on huge attachments, such as large documents and graphic files, all
qmail servers connected to radios (that is, the radiohub in Conakry
and each of the field office servers) are run with a message size
limit of 8,000 characters. This is sufficient for three to four
pages of text and is configured with qmail's databytes control
file. We advise users of this message size limitation, suggest they
stick to plain text for their correspondence and configure their
mail client software accordingly. But whatever can be squeezed into
the 8,000 byte limit by way of attachment and file compression is
free to go. (Users in Conakry, which has a full-time, broadband
gateway to the internet, are not quite as restricted. Here the
databytes control file is set to one megabyte.)</p><p>As one would expect with our software selection, the system
has proven extremely reliable. Despite the intermittent power
outages typical in Conakry, we do try to keep the mailhub server
coyah running at all times through the use of generator and battery
back-up. So far these measures have kept this machine serving
flawlessly since it was first installed, with a continuous uptime
at this writing of over three months, no reboots.</p><p>Yet this reliability would mean nothing if the system were
not sustainable over the long term. Two months before we installed
the first radio server in the field, we formed a Network Users/UNIX
Group among interested and capable IRC staff. This group meets
regularly and enthusiastically to learn Linux/UNIX and to develop
network administration skills. UNIX is a linguistically rich
operating environment, and I think it finds a natural affinity
among Africans whose language abilities seem inherently prodigious.
In any case, the group now has a number of functional production
systems on which to work and play, using mostly recycled hardware.
While this article has focused on qmail and serial communications,
the Linux servers installed for this project also host a typical
range of other servers and services, including DHCP, DNS, natd,
Apache, FTP, Samba and PostgreSQL. The IRC-NU/UG provides a human
network that will continue to sustain and grow the technical
network over the years to come.</p><p>The successes of this project are readily duplicated anywhere
in the world. Schools, government ministries and other NGOs can
easily build remote networking solutions over HF radio where access
is otherwise not available, and at minimal cost. Once installed,
these systems are almost trivial to administer and may be quickly
adapted to alternative TCP/IP carriers. Maintenance of the e-mail
system itself involves only the routine adding/deleting of user
accounts, while keeping the /etc/aliases files up to date.</p><p>The current result of our own Radio E-mail project is that we
are now serving mail to over 50 desktops and 150 staff in four
offices throughout Guinea. The entire wide area network is serviced
behind a single public IP address, at a total ISP cost of $150(USD)
per month. Based mostly on existing hardware, the Radio E-mail
project has leaped boundaries and opened dialogs for its users that
were previously not possible.</p><p>Best of all, the system has deployed standard network and
internet technologies throughout the organization and throughout
Guinea utilizing the freely available, best of breed, borderless
open-source technologies that underlie all global connectivity. Not
only does this plant grass-roots networking infrastructure where
there is yet no Internet, it helps build the core competencies and
capabilities essential for Africa's connected future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1b04630"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://cr.yp.to" target="_self">Dan Bernstein's qmail and
