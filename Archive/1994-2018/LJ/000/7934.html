In the field of information security, there are many useful
occupations: firewall engineer, policy analyst, auditor and security 
architect all are popular choices. But what about information technology
philosopher? There's plenty of value in describing the intersections
between technology and the human experience, but I know of only one
person who makes a living doing so--Richard Thieme.
</p><p>
Richard is an institution on the hacker convention circuit, and he is 
much in demand as a public speaker, business consultant and writer. He
and I recently had a wide-ranging conversation about hacker culture,
computer security, competitive intelligence, homeland security and
Richard's singular career.
</p><p>
If you find this chat as fascinating as I did, and I think you will, be
sure to check out Thieme's new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in the
Clickstream</em></span>, which I review in the February 2005 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux Journal:</b></span> Your theological and
ministerial background has made an obvious impact
on your speaking and writing, but how technology entered into it is less
obvious. When and how did you start moving in geek circles?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard Thieme:</b></span> I began writing about the impact of technology on religious
organizations and institutions, images and ideas and, inevitably, human
identity in the 1980s. I intuitively realized the scope and scale of
the transformational engine we now call the digital world while playing
interactive fiction games from Infocom with my oldest son. Because my
previous work--teaching literature and writing at the University of
Illinois-Chicago, as well as sixteen years of ministry--had taught me
how printed text works, hermeneutics (how meaning is derived from text)
and how we are framed by the experience of reading text, I could see by
contrast that interacting with text on computers created a different
experience, shifted how we thought about our possibilities, our work,
meaning, ourselves--everything.
</p><p>
I literally followed my 12-year-old son into the world of bulletin
boards, on-line life (an Apple 2, Ascii Express and a 300 baud modem)
and continued to explore both the technological machinery as it came
on-line through the 1980s and 90s. I offered to do a keynote for
Def Con 4 and have been at Def Con and Black Hat every year since.
</p><p>
I also had started speaking about different things--change, leadership,
diversity--when I left the ministry and it became clear that all of
it derived from technological change. It was natural to follow that
up. Literally, I followed the dots into new learning.  I joke that I
made sure I always was the dumbest one on the room so I always could 
be learning from the conferences I attended and usually spoke at, but
it was true. Hacker cons led to intel people and security professionals, 
and I learned from every conference and conversation, integrating what 
I was learning on the cutting edge with ferocious amounts of reading--two-three 
non-fiction books a week, plus constant on-line learning and attending
many seminars and workshops at conferences at which I spoke. My focus
always was to translate the implications of what I was hearing about
the technologies and what they enabled into human terms. My background
and propensities gave me a unique opportunity to do that.
</p><p>
Eleven years later, what with immersion in all that, it began to sound
as if I had a clue. Of course, I know better. I am still the dumbest
one in the room, and all that wisdom comes to me downhill.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> I was really struck, in your book, by your assertion that computer
technology defines our reality in the same ways that language itself
does. It led me to the realization that computer security is all about
preserving a desired reality--"my system behaves the way I want it
to"--against attackers wishing to impose different realities--"j00 ar3
0wn3d!". Is that the sort of train of thought that got you involved with
the intelligence and security communities? Or was it the other way around?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> As you perceive, it was give and
take. Every interaction with these smart, experienced people taught me
more. I became a friend to many, and our quiet
conversations (never, of course, betraying anything classified) helped me
to see exactly what you're describing. I am delighted that you see the
implications for security of my ways of thinking. I think I'll quote you!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> You refer to some pretty amazing but credible anecdotes and
revelations made by intelligence agency insiders. How do you get those guys
to open up to you? Do you ever worry about being used as a conduit of
misinformation?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> To the last question, I am aware of it but don't worry about it. The
implications are the same for all sources of information these days;
that is,  how much of any of our consensus realities is designed? How much
is intentional? How much is off the cuff, and how much simply aligned
with the habitual sowing of seeds of malignant design?
</p><p>
I don't think I am that important or a sufficient conduit for anyone to
worry about influencing me that way.
</p><p>
To my deep satisfaction, I can't stop being a priest. Leaving the
ordained ministry did not change how I learned to relate to people.
Of course, I brought that with me into the ministry, but training and
practice made it much more likely that I can cultivate relationships I
value with the people I love. I have been careful if I ever thought something slipped over the line into confidentiality
not to share it or to distort or disguise it. I function as a friend
and confidant, in other words, much as I functioned as a priest. I was
told by an intelligence-community friend that the evidence was in, after
some years, that I handled confidentiality with integrity and could be
trusted. My proudest moment came when I was asked to moderate a panel of
feds, including the Assistant Secretary of Defense, at Def Con 2000 as they literally
feared for their safety when they faced thousands of hackers. I was asked,
I was told, because "you're the only one in the room trusted and respected 
by both hackers and feds."
</p><p>
So my vocation, commitments and deeper intentions--although outside the
lines of how conventional people color--have remained intact.
</p><p>
That same guy said last year that after nine years of hearing me, he
realized what it was I did when I spoke: "You articulate things we all
know in our bones are true but don't know how to say." That thrilled
me, of course. Because that, as you know, is the essence of ministry--to 
see the subtext and give it voice so people can become more powerful.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Back in the mid 90s, when Linux was beginning to catch on,
you already were talking about open-source software and free software
fundamentally changing the software market paradigm. You asserted that 
[the change in the paradigm] and the Internet, which makes it so fast and easy to distribute code,
would make the notion of intellectual property obsolete. But the
powers-that-be still have a strong vested interest in intellectual property--do 
you still think IP's days are numbered?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> A good question. In the short term, we always overstate the
effects of new technologies. But in the long run, we always understate
them. In addition, new info-technologies do not so much eliminate as
recontextualize what has come before. I could go on and on about that. An
example is MS making available more source code than ever before as a
result of the influence of open source. A case could be made that MS
would never have done that, absent that influence.
</p><p>
But, there are problems with open source: many eyes make for many
exploits as well as few bugs or more secure code, some people have
a disproportionate influence on decisions, and there is no customer
orientation because programmers work on what they like without regard
to customer input. Yet, as Linux migrates into the commercial space, it
comes to share many properties of commercial software. The marketplace
shapes the forms we can and do bring into it. So maybe right now we can
see the dialogue between different models and vectors of energy pointing
to possible scenarios for the future. But we can't say which will win out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> The open-source software development model, 
in which sometimes large numbers of coders contribute their efforts with minimal centralized
coordination, always has reminded me of Bakuninist anarchy. (Yes, my
friends usually tell me to get a life when I say that!) Do you see the
same or different precedents, or is the OSS phenomenon fundamentally new?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Ken Coar and I spoke at Los Alamos,
and I also keynoted Apache Con, 
and I paid close attention to what he said were problems, some already
mentioned above. Developers work on scratching itches they have, not what
the marketplace demands. As the e-mail conversation goes around the world,
early contributors have a disproportionate influence on decisions, and by
the time it reaches the land of the rising sun, the die is cast. Linux has
what, more than 30,000,000 lines of code, and a recent study said Linux
was the focus of more discrete attacks than MS server software. The same
problems due to complexity, inscrutability and unforeseen interaction
with applications and appliances from third parties apply as much as to
Linux as they do to 
Windows. 
</p><p>
Linux is not inherently more secure, nor does the process by which
it is evolving inherently generate more secure coding practices. The cry
for secure coding at the outset of applications and OS applies to all
domains, and Microsoft does respond to what customers want. Say what
you will, they have an immense efficient machine for soliciting and
responding to customer feedback. Bloatware was a response to a demand
for more features and indifference to security.  Greater security is
a response to that demand from government, corporate and individual
users. The context does determine the content, as I am fond of saying.
</p><p>
The factors that ultimately determine success or failure of technological
processes are complex and ambiguous until hindsight enables us to say
what happened. Chains of causality are clear only in retrospect, and then
we make the mistake of thinking that [specific] historical trajectory was the
only one that could have happened instead of one of many that happened
to occur as a result of choices, accidents and unknown factors. That fine 
study <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Closed World</em></span>, about the mindspace that emerged
from cybernetics and AI and DARPA and generated the simulated worlds we
inhabit today, does a great job of illuminating that process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> You've talked about video games being mediated realities, with the
potential to become the ultimate interactive art medium. But it seems
like a huge percentage of the most popular commercial games are mindless
and nihilistic. Do you think the game-developing community is living up
to its potential?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Absolutely not. Not yet. It will take time, and I don't know the
ultimate form. I used to think it was interactive fiction, then MOOs
and MUSHES, and now it's vast multiplayer global game spaces. What
has happened for sure is that those spaces profoundly influence how
we think about and formulate responses to everything. The convergence
of technologies often is invisible soon after it happens, and the
interlocking of television, music, radio, hard-drive platforms for
downloading (for example, Tivo) television programs and software
programs--and then saying, "wait, they're all the same"--that becomes
the ubiquitous context that people cease to see or understand. It takes a McLuhan to illuminate how
the medium is the message and what the medium, now invisible, in fact is.
</p><p>
That said, hey, it's early yet. Also true is the extraordinary speed with
which these things have happened as compared to prior technologies. The
demographics determine  the content of the marketplace, and one true
thing is that more niches are enabled in the digital world than ever
before. More exploration takes place, more new art and music and sound
and interactive gamespace is generated, and it is seldom what current
media spotlights, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>HALO 2</em></span>, that ultimately
are the important determinants of the future.
</p><p>
The fastest growing online segment is seniors. Their games are bridge and
hearts and checkers. But the chat rooms that accompany their games fuel
the popularity, the social interaction. Sure, young testosterone-driven
males dominate the public media coverage, but get the statistics on
romance novels versus shoot-em-up games, and I bet you'd be surprised
which is higher.
</p><p>
Time, it takes time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Are you still a gamer? What games
do you confess to having on your hard drive?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> I usually cycle through games looking for how new tendencies might
affect the kinds of things we have been discussing. I particularly am 
interested in narratives, poetic images and text, new ways of addressing
human complexity. Games I have played with from that point of view
include <span   class="emphasis"><em>Republic: The Revolution</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Syberia</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>BladeRunner</em></span>, many of
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>MYST</em></span> series, checking out how the SIMs have
evolved. I observe the XBox and PlayStation games
my kids play, kids of all ages. I played with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Everquest</em></span> but found the
time demands to be too great for me to invest. I look at games such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HALO</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></span> to see how they're evolving. I still go
back frequently to the world of interactive fiction, which is a thriving
small niche.  I think INFOCOM games, including
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Trinity</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Mind Forever
Voyaging</em></span> are spectacular works
of interactive literature and will last. Creative people still explore
that genre and do some fascinating things with it. I continue to follow
the work of Michael Joyce, who pioneered <span   class="emphasis"><em>Afternoon</em></span> and other hypertext
fiction, a medium that has not figured out yet how to provide boundaries
or bounded narrative space to contain possibilities. I also have learned a
ton from my son Aaron Ximm (<a href="http://quietamerican.org" target="_self">quietamerican.org</a>), who has won awards for his
"found sound", another medium that would not exist absent digital tools.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> You are a fixture at Def Con and have been for most of the
last decade. What brought you there, and what keeps you coming back?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> You cannot overstate the way Jeff Moss, a.k.a. Dark Tangent, has
built that space. Yes, he had a lot of help from willing collaborators, but
the vision and ability to execute it with flexibility and canny awareness
have made Def Con unique in the world of cons. I went to Def Con 4 to do
a keynote because he created that opportunity. For me as for many, he said
"Yes" instead of "No". That's the most powerful word in the language, as James
Joyce said. I perceived that the real hackers in that space would be the
thought leaders of the next decade; my first talk was "Hacking as Practice
for Trans-planetary Life in the 21st Century", which stands as validated
by what is emerging now. I went there to learn from mentors who were
one third my age, and it became clear that only if I provided something
of real value to them as well would the reciprocity be genuine. I think
the main attendees intuitively get that my respect and admiration
for them is absolute. I have learned so much about how they have been
socialized by interacting with networks and how that frames the way they
hold themselves in the world as possibilities for meaningful action.
</p><p>
Over the years, I developed close friendships with hackers and
evolving technocrats and people from the worlds of law enforcement and
intelligence. As you know, they're hard to distinguish now, right? I
spoke at the Pentagon recently, and about one third of the people in the
room were Def Con friends but with different haircuts and uniforms. They
still play Spot the Fed at DC, but someone suggested, only half-kidding,
that they ought to play Spot the Hacker. The worlds interpenetrate
so much now and hacking, not cracking, has become so mainstream that
was inevitable.
</p><p>
Now, the crossing of those streams at Def Con was not an accident. It's a
unique and still-fertile space, because Jeff straddled multiple worlds
so well and realized from the beginning that the con would grow only
if he continued to include everybody. That pragmatic approach reminds
me of how I did ministry, really. Only if you included all the players
in the process and minimized doctrines and dogmas that always excluded
some and included others could you build a genuinely diverse community.
But to do that, you had to have a tolerance of ambiguity and complexity
that is irritating to purists on either side, whether hard-core hackers
or law enforcement professionals.
</p><p>
I kept coming back because it really did become a kind of psychic home, 
where a lot of us understood one another's unconventional and creative
approaches to life straight up, whereas out here we often have to explain
ourselves or just shut up and walk away a lot.  Properly understood,
hacking is a mindset that transcends any particular technology. It's
evident at Def Con to a large degree, although it has changed and evolved
over the years. Every year a lot of us think, well, maybe this is the
last year. And maybe it is. But so far it keeps coming back and so do we.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> In 1996, if not earlier, you
already were describing hacking correctly as being about truth and
knowledge and not about breaking into other people's computers. This was
way before the mainstream media had begun to get even a clue on that point--they still don't, really. Do you
think hackers are doomed to be misunderstood? Is that an inevitable
result of knowing how things really work?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Yes. Unconventional thinkers who work across the boundaries of
fixed disciplines do not fit in the molds or models of prior ways of
thinking. First, they sound crazy. Then, they sound funny. Then, people
attack them. Then, everybody believes that they always agreed with them
all along. That's when you know their way of seeing things has become the
core of a new consensus reality, and already new truths that contradict
that are arriving on the edges. That's why I say that the truth, once
everybody believes it, has become a lie, and new truths are out there
on the edges. It's also a way of saying that thought leaders who see the
implications of the present describe the present as they experience it,
not the future. But for those living in the past, it sounds like the
future, and we sound like futurists. We're not. We're simply seeing the
inevitable implications of what's already there but which most people, 
because of habitual thinking or work that does not require them to make
these connections, don't see yet. Nietzsche said originality is merely seeing
a little ahead of others what's coming over the horizon and giving it
a name. Same idea.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Based on your contact with the intelligence community, what do you
think about the current state of homeland security in the US?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Honestly, that's like a blind man describing an elephant; the subject
has come to mean so many different things. Has a lot been done to prevent
or disrupt attacks? Yes. Can any single attack succeed? Yes. Do I believe
the gloves are off, and we have stopped some very serious events? Yes. Are
we still vulnerable? Of course.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> What I actually had in mind was
this: I recently met a federal agent who rolled his eyes when someone mentioned the Department of Homeland
Security. I get the impression that many professionals consider the DHS
to be window dressing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Oh, the Department. I agree with that. It required a person
who could do little and be content with that. But in all of the many areas
where people take it seriously, a lot of things have been done. You can't
confuse political rhetoric meant for perception management and public
consumption for the real policies and actions taking place. Anyway,
we all know there's a big difference between making people feel safer
so society does not implode and actually generating more security.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Exactly, just because DHS is window dressing doesn't mean it can't
be useful window dressing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Perception management is absolutely necessary, right? It's easy to
snipe from the sidelines, but when you have responsibilities that impact
society--we all read from the same script.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Your speech at Def Con 10, in which you basically chucked your
speaker's notes and riffed on the importance of hackers carrying on
in the face of 9/11, the Patriot Act, John Ashcroft and so on, really
was moving--it was the only standing ovation I've ever seen at Def Con.
Do you see any improvement in the US's prospects for civil liberties
now, especially given the most recent election?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> The convergence of enabling technologies of intrusion, interception,
and panoptic reach, combined with a sense of urgency about doing
counter-terror and a clear mandate from the White House to do everything
possible and seek forgiveness afterward rather than permission in advance
has created a dire but often invisible set of threatening conditions. I
asked an intelligence veteran recently if he thought we would ever get
back the Bill of Rights. He said probably not; only if there is some
explosive revelation, a la Watergate, that overwhelms the denial of the
population, because they see what's at stake and the consequences of
what already has been done. It has been built into the
framework of our bureaucracies that will relinquish those new ground
rules reluctantly and only under great duress.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> What's really scary to me about that statement is the feeling that
Watergate could happen again, but the American public still might not
reassert its rights. We seem to have lost our ability to become outraged
by much of anything that happens in Washington. Nobody's suffered any
consequences, for example, for the politically motivated blowing of CIA
operative Valerie Plame's cover. What does that say about us? Is that
defeatism, naivete, cynicism or what?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> I agree. I spoke recently with a veteran journalist about a serious
thing I was told. I asked him how we could get it into the public
domain, and he said it would not do any good even if we did. We discussed, for
example, Gary Webb and the CIA, Contras and crack. Gary lost his career
and told me that could be expected, because when things are made public
they are quickly managed, eclipsed, distorted and so on. As a friend who does
cover and deception [work] said, "illusion, misdirection and ridicule are the
methods, and they are done expertly at all levels of the game". But, and
this is a big but, there is a conscience in this country still, and a hopeful
or idealistic heart would respond to something sufficiently egregious,
I think. Watergate took a long time to ripen, and only when Nixon was
directly implicated did the government fall. Remember the Pentagon
Papers: it takes a whistleblower, someone whose conscience can't stand
it another minute, to document the data for us. It's cumulative, yes?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ:</b></span> Yes, it's whether it culminates
into something that matters.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RT:</b></span> Yes, and what would it take, today?
I don't know what that would look like. Watergate was a wholesale appropriation of the law enforcement
and intelligence worlds to commit crimes--it took a lot.
