of my system, let's get back to some of the business at hand,
namely tweaking old Tux for fun, performance and a better knowledge
of the innards of your Linux system. In the last installment, I
gave you some ideas for tuning network parameters in the
<b  >/proc</b> filesystem. For many /proc tweaks, it is
simply a matter of writing the appropriate value in the appropriate
file and great things happen. As a refresher, here is what we did
to turn on IP forwarding, via <b  >/proc</b> rather than
at boot time or through other menus.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>To make sure that these parameters take, we would add this
line to our <span   class="bold"><b>rc.local</b></span> boot script
and call it done. This brings me to a couple of questions I
received from readers while I was away. Somebody e-mailed to tell
me that they could not find rc.local on their Debian system. Sorry
about that. While I try to make my columns non-release specific, I
sometimes slip into the &ldquo;I'm running this here system&rdquo; trap. To get
the scoop on rc.local, I need to give you the scoop on run levels
and a handful of scripts that run each time your system comes up.
What gets executed at bootup is partly defined by symbolic links
located in an <span   class="bold"><b>rc#.d</b></span> file. The &ldquo;#&rdquo;
represents a number corresponding to the run level.</p><p>What is this run level? In your
<b  >/etc/inittab</b> file, you will find an entry that
says something like this.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    id:3:initdefault:
</pre><p>Note the &ldquo;3&rdquo; at the beginning of the line. This tells me that
when the system comes up, it will, by default, switch to run level
3 (which is full multiuser mode with a command line login). If your
system says &ldquo;5&rdquo;, this tells me you are booting directly to the
graphical desktop. What starts at each of these run levels will be
found in an accompanying <b  >/etc/rc#.d</b> directory,
in my case, <b  >rc3.d</b>. Yeah, it's true. I'm still a
command line guy who starts his X desktop with the
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> command.</p><p>Anyhow, back to this rc.local file. On a Red Hat (or
Mandrake) system, you'll find it hiding under
<b  >/etc/init.d</b>. I hear someone in the back yelling,
&ldquo;Wait a minute and stop right there! Didn't you just say that it
would be in the <b  >rc3.d</b> directory?&rdquo; It is. More or
less.</p><p>If you change directory to <b  >/etc/rc3.d</b> ,
you'll see a number of script files either starting with an &ldquo;S&rdquo; or
a &ldquo;K&rdquo;. Do an <span   class="bold"><b>ls -l</b></span> and you will
notice they are all symbolic links pointing back to a directory
somewhere else. On a SuSE system, the <b  >rc#.d</b>
directories are under <b  >/sbin/init.d</b>, but you will
still find those &ldquo;S&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; files and they point to
<b  >/sbin/init.d</b>. In the case of my Red Hat system,
they point back to the <b  >/etc/rc.d/init.d</b>
directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    lrwxrwxrwx   1 root  root  11 Jul 12 16:09 /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S99local -&gt; ../rc.local
</pre><p>On a Debian system, these scripts point back to
<b  >/etc/init.d</b> which is where I would create my
rc.local file. On my own system, it turns out that rc.local is
executed by a call to <span   class="bold"><b>S99local</b></span>. On
a Debian system, for instance, look for (or create) an S99local
file under the appropriate run level directory. My use (or Red
Hat's) of S99local is (to some degree) convention, but you could,
if you wanted to, be somewhat more arbitrary. The first part of
that name, the &ldquo;S&rdquo;, means &ldquo;start&rdquo; (a &ldquo;K&rdquo; means &ldquo;kill&rdquo;) and the 99
is simply a high enough number that it is likely the last thing
your system executes on boot. The &ldquo;local&rdquo; part is just a name that
means something to me. You might call it &ldquo;rclocal&rdquo; or &ldquo;systemlocal&rdquo;
or &ldquo;iceberg&rdquo;. So, if I want this file started with my run level 3
on that Debian system, I would create a symbolic link like
this.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    ln -s /etc/init.d/rc.local /etc/rc3.d/S99local
</pre><p>Make sure (<span   class="emphasis"><em>of course</em></span>) that the script is
executable. Now, let's get back to some of those tweaks.</p><p>What I gave you last time were all network tweaks. This time
around, I want to show you a few file system tricks. In past lives
(working with other UNIXes), the systems I administered ran complex
databases, often with hundreds of users. I'm fond of the following
tweaks because they represent parameters that require a kernel
rebuild if you find yourself starting to run low. You made your
best guess, but invariably, it would be kernel rebuild time soon
enough. With Linux, these parameters are simple
<b  >/proc</b> tweaks. If you are running a busy database
system with a large number of users, this is one you might run
into. The &ldquo;file-max&rdquo; parameter defines the maximum number of open
files on your system at any given time. For most, the default
&ldquo;4096&rdquo; is plenty. For a busier system, you might want to push that
limit up somewhat. As an example, let's double that number.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    echo "8192" &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre><p>If you get errors stating that you are running out of file
handles, it's definitely time to change that number, but don't wait
for the users to start ringing. Without waiting for errors, you can
take a look under the hood and see when this limit is approaching.
(Preventative maintenance. What a concept.) If you do a
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> on
<b  >/proc/sys/fs/file-nr</b>, you will get three
numbers. The third will be your file-max. The first and second are
the number of <span   class="emphasis"><em>allocated</em></span> file handles and the
number of actual <span   class="emphasis"><em>used</em></span> file handles. Why the
two numbers? When the Linux kernel allocates a file handle, it does
not release it. If you do increase the file-max value, then you
should also increase <span   class="bold"><b>inode-max</b></span> as
well. Considering that each open file requires an inode for stdin,
stdout (and possibly, a network socket) this needs to be somewhat
higher than your file-max. Take your file-max value, triple it and
write it back out to inode-max.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    echo "24576" &gt; /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
</pre><p>Busy web server? News server? Here's another tweak for your
files, and this one has nothing to do with
<b  >/proc</b>. One of the options for the
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> command is &ldquo;noatime&rdquo;. In
other words, do not (don't you even think about it) update the
access time on visited files. Each time a file is read, the access
time is updated which can yield useful information about file usage
(with the <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command, for
instance). Odds are, you may not need that information. In the case
of a web server getting a few thousand hits a day (an hour?), this
little change can make a difference. Historically, this option was
a suggestion for directories on news servers. Today, we are usually
talking web servers. This is an environment where small files are
accessed over and over again ( vs. a database environment which
traditionally has comparatively few, large files).</p><p>To mount a filesystem noatime, use the &ldquo;-o&rdquo; flag, like this.
In this example, we'll use the pretend drive &ldquo;hda5&rdquo;.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     mount -o noatime /dev/hda5 /data1
</pre><p>If you wanted this to happen automatically, you could also
edit your <b  >/etc/fstab</b> file so that you have an
entry similar to this one.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
     /dev/hda5      /data1          ext2    defaults,noatime      1 2
</pre><p>Enough file tweaking for one day. Before we wrap up, I want
to talk about the need for tweaking. Another way to look at it is
this: how do you know that you might be hitting a kind of wall? One
of the surest ways is simply to monitor your system's performance
through the various tools your system already has. The most basic
of these is a little program called
<span   class="bold"><b>uptime</b></span> which most of us use to
drive our Windows-using friends crazy. &ldquo;Ah, I see that you've
rebooted twice today already. Let me run uptime and see what I
get.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   # uptime
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
    1:21pm  up 127 days,  6:02,  4 users,  load average: 0.31, 0.29, 0.26
</pre><p>&rdquo;My, my, my. Would you look at that? 127 days, 6 hours and 2
minutes without a reboot.&ldquo;</p><p>Before we get into too much trouble, let's see what else the
program tells you. There are four users logged in. The load average
is 0.31 over the last minute, 0.29 over the last 5 minutes and 0.26
over the last 15 minutes. Load average indicates roughly the number
of processes in the CPU's run queue; that is, the number of
processes active or waiting to execute. If it helps any, you might
think of it as the number of patients in the waiting room to see
the doctor. In this case, I had an average of one third of one
process waiting to be dealt with. The higher the number for load
average, the more likely your system is starting to suffer under an
excessive load. As the saying goes, your mileage may vary, but I
tend to think of anything under four as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>acceptable</em></span>. Any higher and it starts feeling
slow. I've seen systems running around 15 to 20 and let me tell
you, it's ugly.</p><p>If those numbers are high, the very next question is &rdquo;Why?".
Other questions follow. What is it that is holding things up? If I
am running out of something, how do I know what that something is?
And those are just the types of questions that I want to consider
when next we meet here at the corner. Until then, give Tux a tweak.
You both might enjoy it.</p></div></div>
