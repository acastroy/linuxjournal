    Pull up a Zaurus and make yourself comfortable.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13ed240"></a></h2></div></div><p>You just got your Zaurus and you are very
proud of it. You tried every single application, then even typed
some commands in the terminal, like <b  >uname -a</b>,
<b  >ping localhost</b> and <b  >ifconfig</b>
to prove to yourself that it really is a GNU/Linux machine in the
palm of your hand. You even know where most of the keys are but
still may be looking for the pipe (hint: read
<a href="http://more.sbc.co.jp/slj/doc/pdf/SL5000KeyAssign.pdf" target="_self">more.sbc.co.jp/slj/doc/pdf/SL5000KeyAssign.pdf</a>
to find out that bar = Shift-Space).</p><p>Sweet. But now what should you do? After the initial fun, you
may be wondering what you can actually do with a machine you don't
know how to use, and for which you think no third-party software
exists. This article teaches you how to install software on the
Zaurus and presents some killer applications you should know
about.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13ed500"></a>Synchronizing PIM Data</h2></div></div><p>First and foremost, you must load the Zaurus with your
important information; otherwise, you will have to carry the Zaurus
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> your former PDA in your pocket, or worse,
you will have to keep your Zaurus at home because it would be
useless for your everyday life.</p><p>The first use for any handheld is personal information
management (PIM), such as storing phone numbers, calendar entries,
etc. In fact, the Palm was initially built around these functions,
and if you have purchased a Palm, you probably depend on it to
access your personal information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13ed6b8"></a>How Can You Substitute the Zaurus?</h2></div></div><p>Just take your Palm or your cell phone, and thanks to IrDA
support, you can beam your data directly to the Zaurus, if its ROM
supports IrDA. Launch Applications --&gt; System info --&gt;
Version. If you see ROM version 1.1x, IrDA will work. If not, you
will have to update your ROM with version 1.1x or higher, as
explained below. This may seem like an obvious suggestion, but
sending by infrared is the easiest way to transfer your
data.</p><p>On your Palm, open the relevant application and click on the
first tab and &ldquo;Beam data&rdquo; (calendar), &ldquo;Beam business card&rdquo; (phone
book) or &ldquo;Beam category&rdquo; (phone book) should you want to send every
business card at once.</p><p>On your cell phone, these steps will depend on the cell phone
model. Please read your cell phone manual to find out how you can
activate its infrared port to send data. It must 1) have an
infrared port, 2) support IrDA and 3) conform to the VCS/VCF norm
to send telephone numbers or calendar entries. Any recent cell
phone (like the Siemens S35) will be fine.</p><p>On your Zaurus, now launch Settings --&gt; Beam receive
application and watch your data being received to the new handheld.
Do not forget to click on &ldquo;Add to Address book&rdquo; or &ldquo;Add to
Calendar&rdquo; when prompted to include the received information in the
relevant applications.</p><p>If you have a Windows machine, or if you use Outlook as your
PIM, there is another possibility. Just install intellisync, which
is provided for free on your software disk. It can synchronize with
Outlook or Palm Desktop, which means it will convert your Outlook
or Palm contacts to Zaurus contacts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13ed920"></a>Synchronizing Data</h2></div></div><p>If you choose the intellisync method to get your data, you
need to send it to the Zaurus. If you prefer another method, you
need to back up this data on your PC anyway.</p><p>Look at the Zaurus cradle; you will notice it has a USB port.
We will make it work perfectly with the Linux kernel after some
simple steps.</p><p>First, you must know that the version of your Zaurus ROM
dictates which synchronizing software you can use with your PC. Run
Applications --&gt; System Info --&gt; Version to find which ROM
your Zaurus is running. Read &ldquo;Updating the ROM&rdquo; below if you want
to use a specific version. If you cannot see any ROM version
information on there, then you are running a 1.02.</p><p>Go to
<a href="http://more.sbc.co.jp/slj/download.asp" target="_self">more.sbc.co.jp/slj/download.asp</a>
to download the synchronizing software you need. The installation
instructions are provided with the software. You may have to patch
your kernel to compile a USB module.</p><p>Should you need more help, an excellent
<a href="http://www.ruault.com/Zaurus/ethernet-over-usb-howto.html" target="_self">step-by-step
guide is available</a>. It includes help to make your Zaurus
connect to the Internet using your computer connection.</p><p>The synchronizing software on your PC will let you save data
every time you want to. It is recommended that you back up your
agenda on a daily basis. You can then use desktop software or your
computer to maintain it as well as your Zaurus and have both
versions always synchronized.</p><p>Now that you have your Zaurus connection working, please back
up your data <span   class="emphasis"><em>immediately</em></span> because we are going
to test all kinds of software. You don't want to lose the PIM data
you carefully put on your Zaurus, do you?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13edd40"></a>Flashing the ROM</h2></div></div><p>Did you get a developer version Zaurus 5000D? Have you
already flashed it? If you have not, you should consider updating
the ROM.</p><p>First, which ROM version are you using? If you have read the
previous sections you already know that Applications --&gt; System
info --&gt; Version will tell you which ROM version you are
using.</p><p>The ROM updating process is very simple. First, go to
<a href="http://more.sbc.co.jp/slj/index.asp" target="_self">more.sbc.co.jp/slj/index.asp</a>
and download the ROM version you need. Remember, the latest is not
always the best; for example, 1.11 is known to leave very few
places to install applications, peg CPU usage at 100% all the time
and keep the system load at 5+.</p><p>If you want a free-software only ROM, without the
closed-source Java environment or the Opera browser, you can get it
from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openzaurus" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/openzaurus</a>.</p><p>Once you have downloaded the ROM file of your choice, you
have to send it to your Zaurus. The best way is to put in on a
CompactFlash card. You can get one for less than $70. You also will
have to buy a CompactFlash USB reader or a PCMCIA converter for
CompactFlash cards for using the CompactFlash card on your PC.
Please check which device drivers are available for using this
hardware on your GNU/Linux computer. You will use it to install a
lot of applications in the following sections.</p><p>Now rename the ROM file to romimage, and put it in the root
directory of your CompactFlash card. It must have been formatted in
FAT16 to be recognized properly by your Zaurus. Just insert the
card, pop up a terminal and type <b  >ls -l /mnt/cf</b>
to check if the file is present.</p><p>If you have any important data in your Zaurus, you should
back it up using the synchronizing software as explained before.
Any data will be lost during the ROM update process. You have been
warned!</p><p>Now, turn off your Zaurus and plug in the AC power. The
orange &ldquo;charging battery&rdquo; LED will turn on. Next, open the battery
compartment lid but do not take the battery out. Now the tricky
part: while pressing the C and D keys on the keyboard at the same
time, press the full reset button once. This button is located
below the battery compartment and can be accessed with a
stylus.</p><p>You may need a friend to help with this awkward key-pressing
sequence. If you were successful, both LEDs will turn on and the
update process will start. You should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
touch anything or play with the power plug or reset button. An
incomplete ROM update may damage the Zaurus. It is best to have a
coffee and come back three minutes later. You will find both LEDs
turned off. You can then eject the card, close the battery
compartment and press the reset button. The next time you start up
the Zaurus, the new ROM will be used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13ee268"></a>Installing Applications</h2></div></div><p>Even with the new ROM, your Zaurus is quite empty. You may
have noticed that new applications, like the sound recorder or the
infrared apps, came with the ROM update. Run Applications --&gt;
Terminal and try some commands. You will quickly find top, vi and
other command-line utilities missing.</p><p>If you did try to type <b  >rpm</b> or
<b  >dpkg</b>, you must be wondering how you can install
applications on the Zaurus. Are we back to old Slackware plain
.tar.gz time?</p><p>For obvious memory-size limitations, rpm or dpkg cannot be
used on the mobile Linux environments. The problem was solved when
the first versions of Linux running on the Compaq iPAQ appeared: a
new packaging format was designed to be simple and straightforward.
Its name is ipkg, and it is mostly a .tar.gz with some basic
control information on control.tar.gz and the data on data.tar.gz
in the Debian way.</p><p>If you want to install an application, just type
<b  >ipkg install package.ipk</b>. Make sure it was
compiled for ARM CPU and that you have the libraries it will need.
If you want to remove a package, <b  >ipkg remove
package</b> will do it.</p><p>You also can use Settings --&gt; Add Remove Software, but it
fails to work sometimes. Typing <b  >ipkg</b> on the
command line is the best way to install software.</p><p>But how can you bring .ipk files to your Zaurus? If you
followed the previous advice, you may have purchased a CompactFlash
card and a converter to update the ROM.</p><p>If you have not, consider an SDRAM card. This will let you
use the additional storage space while a device is plugged into the
CompactFlash port.</p><p>Installing software is just downloading a .ipk file on your
computer, putting it on the Flash card (CompactFlash or SDRAM) and
transferring the files with <b  >ipkg</b>.</p><p>To find out where your Flash card is mounted, start a
terminal and type <b  >mount</b>. If you can see /mnt/cf
or /mnt/card, just go to this directory using <b  >cd
/mnt/cf</b>, then type <b  >ls</b> to see a list of
available files. Typing <b  >ipkg install
somefile.ipk</b> will then transfer the files to the
Zaurus.</p><p>You may then remove the ipkg file, but it is recommended you
keep it somewhere on your PC because a new handheld is like a new
toy&mdash;you are likely to try a lot of different software before
deciding what is worth keeping.</p><p>Some recommendations now: first, get the famous vi editor
because you will need an editor to change your configuration files
in /etc. This vi package will get you ps as well. If you prefer
Emacs, download
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/uEmacs4s1_arm.ipk" target="_self">prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/uEmacs4s1_arm.ipk</a>
instead.</p><p>You also must install zlib from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/zlib_1.1.2_arm.ipk" target="_self">prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/zlib_1.1.2_arm.ipk</a>
since many applications depend on it.</p><p>An excellent way to start using the Zaurus is by playing
games. The best way to play games on the Zaurus is to install an
emulator. What about playing plain old Nintendo GameBoy games? If
you have purchased the games,
<a href="http://www.slac.com/~mpilone/projects/qtopiagnuboy.phtml" target="_self">get
GnuBoy</a> and find a way to download the ROM files legally for
the game you own. Keep in mind that downloading ROM files on the
Internet for games you do not have is illegal.</p><p>By making a few changes, you can get a GnuBoy application
associated with all of the *.gb and *.gbc files. This means you
will be able to start each GameBoy game by simply selecting the
files from the Documents tab.</p><p>You installed an editor, didn't you? So next add the
following line to /home/QtPalmtop/etc/mime.types:</p><p><b  >application/gameboy gb gbc</b></p><p>And add these lines to qtopiagnuboy.desktop:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MimeType=application/gameboy
        MimeTypeIcons=GnuBoy
</pre><p>You must know NetHack&mdash;wouldn't you like to play it on your
Zaurus as well? Download the .ipk file from
<a href="http://trolls.troll.no/warwick/nethack" target="_self">trolls.troll.no/warwick/nethack</a>.</p><p>If you prefer a plain old chess game, do not forget the
Zaurus is a Java-capable device, so you can get Laser Chess Java
from
<a href="http://www.laserchess.org/downloads/laserchess_1.09_arm.ipk" target="_self">www.laserchess.org/downloads/laserchess_1.09_arm.ipk</a>.</p><p>Now, you may want to take a screenshot of the applications
you are evaluating. Using the screenshot applet is straightforward.
Download it from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/screenshotapplet_0.1_arm.ipk" target="_self">prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/screenshotapplet_0.1_arm.ipk</a>.</p><p>What about installing the X Window System? While the Zaurus
comes with Qtopia, there is nothing preventing you from installing
X as well, except memory limitations of course!</p><p>Download all the X files from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845</a>
and put them on your Flash card.</p><p>Now from the terminal, install x11zaurus_0.2_arm.ipk by
typing <b  >ipkg install x11zaurus*</b>; say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the
reboot question; let your Zaurus restart, and then drop to the
console again. To prevent Qtopia from starting, press the / key
when you see the Wait message if you use ROM version 1.1x, or press
the space key for versions prior to 1.1x.</p><p>Then install icewm with <b  >ipkg install
icewm_*</b> and start X plus the window manager by typing
<b  >wm</b>.</p><p>The first time you run X, you should see the touchscreen
calibration page. Slowly drag the stylus to the upper-left corner
until it bumps against the corner of the plastic frame, then do the
same in the lower-right corner when prompted to do so.</p><p>Then the window manager should start. It has a couple of
applications, as well as default themes, preconfigured.</p><p>Here are some X installation notes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The installation scripts support SD and CF card
installation. Follow the prompts on installation and point it to
either /mnt/card or /mnt/cf as appropriate.</p></li><li><p>To recalibrate your X display if it gets crooked,
exit X, start up in console mode and type <b  >touch
/etc/FORCE_ZTSD_CAL</b>.</p></li><li><p>X installation is known to fail with ROM version
1.11 because of the lack of disk space, and /dev/isd may be missing
as well, so you should choose the safe path and Flash an old ROM
version (and use appropriate synchronization software) if you want
to use X.</p></li></ul></div><p>We can only hope that a new ROM version will fix the X
installation problem soon. Meanwhile, you can play with some
interesting X applications.</p><p>What about snes9x, available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845?" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845?</a>
It is the famous Nintendo SuperNes emulator. Just like the GameBoy
emulator, make sure you have the games: it is illegal to download
ROMs for games you do not own.</p><p>Even better, get xcopilot at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/</a>
and download the ROM of your Palm to the Zaurus. Once again, it is
illegal to download Palm ROM to the Zaurus if you do not have a
Palm. Now you are able to run your former Palm applications inside
the Zaurus.</p><p>We will not insist on these two emulators because they
prevent you from enjoying most of the Zaurus applications, which
run on Qtopia and require you to reboot to use the X Window System.
An xcopilot emulator running natively on Qtopia would let you run
Palm applications with greater flexibility, either next to Qtopia
applications or while using Qtopia applications. It is rumored to
be under development. It will certainly be a killer application and
broaden the Zaurus market acceptance through Palm
compatibility.</p><p>If you want more applications, whether for X, the command
line or Qtopia, just go to
<a href="http://www.handango.com/sharp" target="_self">www.handango.com/sharp</a>
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39939&amp;release_id=70845</a>
where you will find a lot of interesting software.</p><p>What about a movie now? Go to
<a href="http://www.pocketmovies.net" target="_self">www.pocketmovies.net</a>
and download a trailer. Then start Applications --&gt; Media
Player, choose Options --&gt; Full screen, plug in earphones and
enjoy!</p><p>The quality is excellent for such a small device. You can
play movies in MPEG-1 SIF (320 x 240) format at 24 frames per
second. If you want more frames per second or want to store more
movies, HALF SIF (160 x 120) is also possible. The &ldquo;Fit to screen&rdquo;
option will make the low resolution nearly unnoticeable on this
small screen.</p><p>With the 1GB IBM Microdrive CompactFlash hard disk, you
should even be able to take some movies on your pocket, even more
if you think Sharp promised DIVX support soon. Meanwhile, some
hints may help you: renicing the mpegplayer process to -20
increases the frame rate. You also can reduce the throughput
(400KB) and use VBR (variable bit rate) in your mpeg-1 encoder to
get a better looking video. A low sound quality like mono/22KHz
also can be helpful to store more movies and increase the frame
rate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13e63b8"></a>Software Indigestion, Swap and Memory</h2></div></div><p>Ouch. If you tried all the software we suggested, your Zaurus
is now having indigestion. The symptoms of this overfilling are
simple: <b  >ipkg install</b> now gives you &ldquo;no space
left&rdquo; errors.</p><p>You do not have a lot of options. It is either <b  >ipkg
remove</b> to get rid of useless software or ROM Flash back
to version 1.10. This very version will leave you more RAM disk
space left.</p><p>First, try to remove any temporary files from /tmp by typing
<b  >cd /tmp ; rm -fr *</b>. This may help a little bit
because ipkg leaves the temporary files in /tmp, which increases
the overfilling whenever it gets an installation error.</p><p>The 32MB of RAM in the 5000D developer version can be filled
rather fast. This is because the ROM software has to be
uncompressed in the RAM, eating most of the free space. Moreover,
the RAM is then shared between the memory you use for your
applications and the RAM disk where you are installing
applications.</p><p>So do not trust the 32MB of RAM sticker for 5000D or the 64MB
of RAM claim for the 5500. Think about memory available: in the
5000D with ROM version 1.11, you only have a 6MB RAM disk, i.e.,
less than a standard Palm!</p><p>Fortunately, we have a software solution with Linux: flashing
a ROM, which is known to leave a RAM disk big enough to install
applications, and creating a swap file to increase the system
memory we are using for the RAM disk or flashing a ROM, which will
use all the memory available to Linux as RAM, and using an external
device like the SDRAM Flash card where you will install your
software.</p><p>For the first option, you should use the 1.10 version, which
has a 16MB RAM disk and for the second option, a custom-made ROM
available from
<a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~p.flinders/sl-5000d/readme.html" target="_self">www.btinternet.com/~p.flinders/sl-5000d/readme.html</a>
will be just fine.</p><p>In both cases, purchase a 128MB SDRAM card, and plug it in to
the Zaurus. It will free your CompactFlash slot for hardware
peripherals like a wireless network card.</p><p>If you decide to use the custom ROM, just format the Flash
card to use it as disk space where additional applications will be
installed.</p><p>If you want to use swap (it can be done in both cases even if
it is not mentioned on the custom ROM page), get fdisk from
<a href="http://handhelds.org" target="_self">handhelds.org/</a> and create
two partitions on the SDRAM: <b  >fdisk
/dev/mmcda</b>.</p><p>Then type <b  >n p 1 +25M t 82</b> to create a
first partition of 25MB, which will be used for swap (type 82 is
swap). Create a second partition, filling the rest of the card with
<b  >n p 2 enter enter</b>. It will be used as free disk
space.</p><p>Now start the swap with <b  >swapon /dev/mmcda1</b>
and mount the other partition with</p><p><b  >mount /dev/mmcda. g/usr/mnt.rom/card -t
ext2</b></p><p>Whenever the system goes in suspend mode or is rebooted, the
swap will be removed. This is both a bug and a feature. It can be
fixed with some /etc file editing, but you won't want to do that
because there is only a limited number of total writes on a Flash
card. You will ruin your SD card quickly if you do that.</p><p>However, while the NAND-type Flash used in most cards is
usually specified at 100,000 erase/write cycles, this is only the
minimum specification. Moreover, the Flash card controller adds ECC
bytes to each 512-byte block and does wear leveling.</p><p>We can assume a continuous writing on a swap area at 100KB
per second. Thanks to the wear leveling, the controller will cycle
though the sectors, so if we have an 8MB swap area, it will do one
erase/write per sector every 80 seconds. A real smart controller
might even distribute them over the whole card.</p><p>The ECC algorithms will increase the erase/write cycles to at
least 1M cycles per sector. That will give you two and a half years
before seeing any failing sectors, and at that time the controller
will start using spare sectors.</p><p>Therefore, if used properly, a Flash card will last for the
lifetime of the system and definitely beat the MTBF (mean time
before failure) of any hard disk even if you put your swap
partition on it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13e6e08"></a>Getting the Internet</h2></div></div><p>Having the Zaurus connect to the Internet is quite simple
because the Zaurus uses the Linux kernel and its IP stack. You do
not need a dirty hack, like the ones required to have a Palm
connected.</p><p>Basically, you have two possibilities: use the cradle to
connect to the Internet or get a wireless card.</p><p>If you have followed the &ldquo;Synchronizing data&rdquo; guide, you
already have a working cradle connection. But this is no fun. Don't
you want to be able to walk around with a Star Trek
Communicator-like device, browse the Internet, read and write your
mail wirelessly and even send instant messages or use IRC? If so,
read on.</p><p>The best and easiest way to get a working wireless internet
connection on the Zaurus is to go 802.11b. You have to buy hardware
to do that; a CompactFlash 802.11b card will cost you around $100.
Please make sure it will work with the Zaurus before getting one;
read the compatibility list on
<a href="http://more.sbc.co.jp/slj/peri.asp" target="_self">more.sbc.co.jp/slj/peri.asp</a>.
If you do not know which card you should buy, go for a Linksys WFC
11. I could get it for $120 at J&amp;R in Manhattan. On the
Internet, you can get it for less than $100 with shipping and
handling included.</p><p>If you have a ROM prior to 1.1x, you will have to edit your
configuration file to make it work. Have you installed an editor as
suggested? In /etc/pcmcia/wlan-ng.conf, add</p><pre     class="programlisting">
card 'Linksys WCF11 11Mbps 802.11b WLAN Card'
manfid 0x0274, 0x3301
bind 'prism2_cs'
</pre><p>Restarting the PCMCIA service or rebooting will make the card
work. In 1.1x ROM or newer, you just need to plug in the card to
make it work&mdash;a real plug-and-play with no driver needed.</p><p>On the Zaurus, go to Settings --&gt; Network and Sync and
configure your wireless card. Give it an IP address on the local
network with the laptop IP as the gateway machine, then the DNS IP,
or use DHCP to fill this information automatically if there is a
DHCP server on your laptop.</p><p>Now that you have a 802.11b-capable Zaurus, you need another
device to provide internet connectivity via the 802.11b network.
You have two choices: purchase an access point or use ad hoc mode
with another 802.11b card to share an existing internet connection
on the computer using this other card.</p><p>An access point is the best option, and you can now get one
for $100. A hacker-friendly Linksys WAP11 is just perfect. Not only
does it work well with GNU/Linux using SNMP software, but you also
can update its firmware, use directional antennas to make a long
distance wireless bridge, etc.</p><p>Now, if you have an access point, the WAP configuration and
installation is up to you. Make sure it is plugged in to your
Ethernet network. On the Zaurus, go to Settings --&gt; Wireless
LAN, and configure your CompactFlash wireless card to use &ldquo;access
point&rdquo; mode.</p><p>If you are using a PCMCIA 802.11b in a laptop as your access
point, install masquerading software on the laptop to share the
internet connection. Then set up ad hoc mode. Check the module
parameters or the manual you used to configure your wireless
connection. On the Zaurus, go to Settings --&gt; Wireless LAN and
configure your CompactFlash wireless card to do ad hoc mode as
well.</p><p>In both cases, should you set up WEP, be sure to use the same
settings on your laptop and your Zaurus, otherwise nothing will
work. Now if everything went well, try to ping your Zaurus. Does it
work? Launch Applications --&gt; Opera and try to access the
Internet. Congratulations! You are now on-line and ready for the
next part, installing internet-aware applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f5580.0x13e7388"></a>Internet Applications</h2></div></div><p>Now that you can walk around with the Zaurus in the palm of
your hand, while being connected to the Internet, there are some
applications you <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to install.</p><p>First is tkcjabber, a commercial, closed-source application
from
<a href="http://www.thekompany.com" target="_self">www.thekompany.com</a>
that is worth every cent. Basically, it will turn your 802.11b
Zaurus into an instant messenger that is always on if you run it in
the background. Using ICQ, AIM, MSN, YM and IRC will now be just
like using a cell phone.</p><p>When you receive a message, the Zaurus &ldquo;incoming message&rdquo; LED
blinks, and a cell phone-like sound is played. Then you can chat in
a window.</p><p>There are only two drawbacks. First, the interface is
icon-only. The first time you use it will be the worst: no
tooltips, no text, no nothing. Fortunately, the user interface is
very intuitive, and you will not be lost for long, except for the
contacts. I have yet to find how to add contacts by ICQ number or
nickname.</p><p>The second big problem is AIM connectivity. With the
tkcjabber test version I used, I got disconnected from AIM every
minute for the famous &ldquo;unauthorized software access&rdquo; reason&mdash;a very
strange reason, considering Jabber got a license to use AIM. These
bugs are very minor and did not interfere with the daily use of
this great application. It is a recommended purchase. In fact, like
Opera, it should come bundled with the Zaurus because you will
always run it if you do instant messaging.</p><p><a href="http://zic.sourceforge.net" target="_self">Zic is a free
application</a> that only does IRC. We can only hope it will
compete with tkcjabber soon because competition would increase the
quality of both products.</p><p>Now what about sniffing wireless traffic? There is an
excellent application running on the Zaurus to sniff 802.11b
traffic. If you are using a prism2-based wireless card, like the
Linksys WCF11, you should not have any problem installing and using
it.</p><p>Go to
<a href="http://kismetwireless.net" target="_self">kismetwireless.net</a>
and download the binary archive for the Zaurus. Uncompress it with
<b  >tar zxvf</b>. It will give you the ipkg file you can
install with <b  >ipkg install</b>. If you installed zlib
before as suggested, you are ready to run it. However, there is one
fault: you cannot sniff traffic and use the wireless connection at
the same time.</p><p>Therefore, you should use the following script to start
Kismet. Store the script (see Listing 1) in
/usr/local/bin/sniff.</p><p><a href="5902l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Script to Start
Kismet</a></p><p>Now try to do a ping to the Zaurus from your computer, and
launch this script. You will see that it will not only find your
access point but also the channel being used, and then capture the
traffic. As suggested on the Kismet web site, you should use
ethereal to process the dump file. The next versions of Kismet will
let you plug in a GPS on the audio port of the Zaurus (to read the
wireless network position) and may decrypt WEP.</p><p>Now that you can sniff traffic, scanning the machines on the
wireless is the next logical step. This is where Nmap comes in. Get
it from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/zutilsnmap-extra.zip" target="_self">prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zaurus/zutilsnmap-extra.zip</a>,
and port scan the machines on the wireless network using
<b  >nmap IPaddress</b>.</p><p>You can get OpenSSH for the Zaurus from
<a href="http://www.handango.com/sharp/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?siteId=423&amp;platformId=9&amp;productType=2&amp;productId=27113&amp;sectionId=0&amp;catalog=80" target="_self">the
Sharp web site</a>.</p><p>It is not a standard ipkg file but a .tar.gz archive with an
install script within. To install OpenSSH, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar zxvf openssh*.tar.gz
cd openssh
./install.sh m
</pre><p>This will install OpenSSH in the main memory. If you have an
SDRAM card, replace <b  >./install.sh m</b> with
<b  >install.sh s</b>. Do not install OpenSSH on the
CompactFlash port, since the wireless card will use it, and you
will not be able to use OpenSSH and the network connection at the
same time.</p><p>Note: you cannot untar the archive and install it. The /root
directory is the home directory for the root user on many UNIX
platforms and the Zaurus. However, it is mounted read-only at boot
time, while many applications, including OpenSSH, expect to write
to this directory. The Zaurus actually uses /home/root as the root
home directory, but through some .profile hack. You need to fix
that directly in /etc/passwd where /root is mentioned.</p><p>Editing /etc/passwd by setting /home/root as the home
directory instead of /root solves the problem. This should be
considered one of the many bugs that Sharp needs to fix by
default.</p><p>If you have not installed an editor, or if you do not know
how to use one, type the following command to fix
/etc/password:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -e ':/root:/home/root:' /etc/passwd &gt; /tmp/passwd
cp -p /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.BAK
mv /tmp/passwd /etc
</pre><p>Once this is done, you can complete the installation. Now
that you have OpenSSH installed, not only can you administer a
remote machine, but you can also remotely log in on the Zaurus with
SSH. Type <b  >killall -HUP inetd</b> to restart the
inetd d&aelig;mon and allow for incoming SSH connections.</p><p>An FTP d&aelig;mon running on the nonstandard port 4242
completes the SSH. You can use it to get the files you handle with
an SSH connection. But did you know there is no root password on
the Zaurus by default? This means you are walking around with an
open FTP server in your pocket, accessible with 802.11b. You may
run <b  >passwd</b> to set up a root password, but it
does nothing to the FTP server, as if it was not using
/etc/password. At least, the latest version of the ROM makes the
FTP server open only on the USB network interface.</p><p>Anyway, a mobile FTP server would be great if only you could
put a password on it. Now, what about an HTTP server to complete
it? Get boa from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_self">sourceforge.net</a>, and
you can tell your friends you are walking with your internet server
and that they can open an SSH version to administer it if they
want&mdash;just make sure not to mention the FTP d&aelig;mon.</p><p>If they do not have SSH, or if they would prefer a graphical
remote administration, what about using VNC? Grab a VNC server for
the Zaurus from
<a href="http://opensource.lineo.com/fbvncserver" target="_self">opensource.lineo.com/fbvncserver</a>
(<a href="ftp://opensource.lineo.com/fbvncserver/zaurus-fbvncserver_0.1.1_arm.ipk" target="_self">opensource.lineo.com/fbvncserver/zaurus-fbvncserver_0.1.1_arm.ipk</a>
currently) and install it. Then somewhere on your network, start a
VNC client; the Zaurus display is exported as if it was running
X.</p><p>After you are done, you really deserve some time off. So, go
get
<a href="http://www.handango.com/sharp/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?siteId=423&amp;platformId=9&amp;productType=2&amp;productId=26986&amp;sectionId=0&amp;catalog=80" target="_self">the
demo version of zradio</a>, a radio streamer. For only $10, you
can use it to listen to on-line radio stations from your Zaurus. If
you do not like the earphones, you may try the speaker hack from
<a href="http://www.zymurgy.net/zaurus.html" target="_self">www.zymurgy.net/zaurus.html</a>.
Maybe the next version of this hack will include a microphone,
which would let you use your Zaurus as a memo with the default
&ldquo;Recorder&rdquo; application.</p><p>I hope you had some fun and found a lot of ideas for possible
uses of the Zaurus with this software review.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guylhem Aznar</b></span> is the
