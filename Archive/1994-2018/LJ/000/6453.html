</p><p>Editors' Note: The following is a chapter from the book
Multitool Linux, written by Michael Schwarz, Jeremy Anderson, Peter
Curtis and Steven Murphy. Consult the
<a href="http://www.multitool.net/mtl" target="_self">book's web site</a>
for links, updates and errata.</p><p>Question: How can I get access to my home Linux system when
I'm 1)at work behind a firewall that only allows me to send e-mail
from my workstation or 2)away on a business trip and the hotel
firewall only allows me to surf the Web?</p><p>Answer: Create an e-mail-based console application that let's
you execute commands and return results via e-mail. If you're stuck
with only web access, get a web e-mail account somewhere and use it
to send commands over e-mail to your system at home. The e-mail
console is a nice way to communicate with your system when normal
communications (Telnet, ssh, FTP, what-have-you) are not
available.</p><p>Have you ever been sitting around at work and wished you
could execute a command on your home Linux system to find some
information? I have and I bet you could find lots of reasons why
you would want to do this as well. E-mail is simple, yet powerful.
But can it be used as a console to your home Linux system? You bet!
I use it all the time.</p><p>But why not just log in and execute commands in the
traditional manner? Sure, I could do that, but that would be no
fun. In addition, there are times when direct access to a system is
not available. But if e-mail is available, then this e-mail console
application will work for you. First, I'll tell you about how I
arrived at developing the e-mail console, then I'll share how I did
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d78ce8"></a>My Disconnected System</h2></div></div><p>If you're like me, at one time you probably connected to the
Internet using a standard phone line and a local ISP. I like my
ISP, but they limit the number of hours I can be on-line each month
and charge me big bucks when I go over that limit. I won't switch
ISP's because they are, without a doubt, the best in my area.
Because of this restriction to my on-line adventures, I pick and
choose the times when my Linux system will be on-line fetching
e-mail, downloading files and so forth. The problem I have with
this situation is I want access to my home system when I am at
work. And when I'm at work, I often find myself needing to access
my home system to get a file. With my monthly limit, I can't simply
leave my computer continuously connected to the Internet during the
day. What I need is a way to keep my home system off-line until I
need it and then have it go on-line and stay that way until I tell
it to disconnect.</p><p>Some time ago I decided to make it so my system would
periodically connect to the Internet and download e-mail from my
ISP using a nifty program called fetchmail. I wrote a few Perl
scripts to automate and synchronize the connection requests from
various applications, including SETI@HOME and fetchmail, which both
need to connect to the Internet at various times. Plus, I needed to
go on-line to surf around but not get disconnected when the
fetchmail utility completed its work. Getting e-mail with fetchmail
allows me to spend as little connection time as possible getting
and responding to e-mail&mdash;why waste connection time typing
replies?</p><p>The main goal of these scripts is to coordinate the
connection and disconnection requests and keep my system on-line
when needed. It then occurred to me that if I could somehow send an
e-mail to my system (which picked up e-mail once an hour) and
somehow have that e-mail parsed, so a command could be executed, I
could tell my system to stay on-line or disconnect. Bingo! Now all
I had to do was find that e-mail parsing, command-executing, dream
utility. The solution was right under my keyboard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d78ea0"></a>Getting Connected</h2></div></div><p>On a piece of paper beneath my keyboard was a list of
utilities I thought might be useful for dealing with my e-mail;
procmail was one of them. Procmail, as it turns out, is an
incredibly useful utility for performing searches on incoming
e-mail and then performing some kind of action. Currently, I use
procmail to parse my incoming e-mail every 15 minutes (I changed it
from an hour down to 15 minutes so I wouldn't have to wait so long
to access my system). It executes the command that tells my system
to stay on-line after it is done fetching e-mail. Now, I can send
e-mail to my home system with a special subject like &ldquo;CONNECT
REMOTE&rdquo;, and my system will simply stay on-line after fetching and
processing all the e-mail from my ISP. In my procmail configuration
file, a recipe file, I searched for this string and then executed
the Perl script I had written to make it so my system stayed
on-line. I could also tell it to disconnect. Once I had this set
up, it occurred to me that with a little more work, I could write a
procmail recipe and Perl script that would execute any arbitrary
command I gave it. This was the coolest thing I had ever heard of,
and my &amp;quote;NT&amp;quote; friends would be so jealous!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d78fa8"></a>Locking It Down</h2></div></div><p>Because anyone can send me an e-mail, I had to work out a
protocol that would allow me and trusted friends but no one else to
execute commands. I also needed to ensure that the results were
returned securely, safe from snooping eyes. The solution to all of
this lies with encryption and digital signatures found in another
great utility, GnuPG.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d790b0"></a>The Project</h2></div></div><p>Now that you know the story of how the e-mail console came to
be, it's time to put together all the pieces and make a working
system. The following utilities are necessary for this
project:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fetchmail - to get the mail</p></li><li><p>procmail - to parse and execute the e-mail console
script</p></li><li><p>GnuPG - to decrypt the e-mail and verify the
authenticity of the sender</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d79420"></a>The Disclaimer</h2></div></div><p>Doing this project could seriously damage your system. If you
implement this project, anyone&mdash;and I mean anyone&mdash;on the planet
with Internet access and an e-mail account has the potential to be
able to execute any command&mdash;even as root&mdash;on your system. Please,
do not attempt this project if you are not 100% sure you can secure
your system from unauthorized use. In plain English, don't do this
project unless you know what you are doing, and don't blame me if
you screw it up and get your system hacked. I warned you. You know
what? Just don't do it. Just read the [article] and learn. But
don't do it. Imagine logging in one day to discover your hard disk
has been wiped clean by some hacker who discovered he could send a
simple e-mail containing a few simple commands to your system. You
have been warned: do this project at your own risk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d79528"></a>Understanding E-mail</h2></div></div><p>E-mail comes in; e-mail goes out. Simple, right? Ah, not so
my friend. Your e-mail requirements and my e-mail requirements are
probably different. With this in mind, I'm going to take the easy
way out and describe my e-mail setup. You cane work out for
yourself how to adapt the e-mail console for your e-mail
setup.</p><p>I use Exim as my mail delivery agent (MDA). This delivers
incoming mail to my personal mail folder/file. On a side note, a
mail transport agent (MTA) delivers mail between connected mail
hosts. On yet another side note, a mail user agent (MUA) is the
e-mail client program you use to read and send e-mail with. A lot
of Linux distributions use sendmail as their MDA.</p><p>Whatever works for you should be fine. The key thing to
remember is when using a MDA, local e-mail is delivered to your
e-mail file, which is usually /var/ mail/your_account. Some Linux
distributions might differ on this configuration. I'm going to
assume you don't receive e-mail directly from the Internet but
instead use an ISP to store e-mail for you. If you are set up with
a DNS, a static IP and have direct Internet e-mail capabilities,
stop reading because you probably know more about e-mail systems
than I do.</p><p>When e-mail is waiting at your ISP, you have basically two
ways to retrieve it. The first is to use a client e-mail program
like KMail or Netscape Mail and retrieve your e-mail via POP or
IMAP. The second option is to use fetchmail, which also uses POP or
IMAP. It delivers your e-mail to your MDA, which then delivers the
e-mail to your local account's mailbox (/var/mail/you_account).
There are other ways to get your e-mail, but they are not relevant
to this discussion.</p><p>Once the e-mail is in /var/local/your_account, you can use
almost any e-mail client to retrieve it. This usually means
transferring the e-mail to another folder in your home folder,
.mail or Mail, or some other location.</p><p>In Part II we'll talk about fetchmail, procmail and how to
make them work together.</p><p>Copyright 2002 by Addison-Wesley. All rights reserved.
