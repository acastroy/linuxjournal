    VNC as an alternate method of remote access&mdash;how does it
    rank?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a91138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Virtual network computing (VNC), a remote
access application from
<a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc" target="_self">AT&amp;T
Laboratories Cambridge</a>, is a great tool for remote desktop
viewing and manipulation. Its core function is to allow the user to
use the VNC client to connect to a host running the VNC server and
remotely use the server's desktop. Keyboard and mouse updates are
sent to the server, and snapshots of the server's desktop are
compressed and sent back to the client via the VNC protocol. A few
of VNC's most compelling features are: excellent platform
portability, an open-source code base, conservative bandwidth usage
and excellent pricing (free!).
</p><p>For this review I have evaluated VNC primarily in three
areas: stability, performance and portability. Below, I also
compare VNC to X to illustrate the domain of usefulness for each.
For this evaluation I used the following test scenarios:</p><p>&lt;il&gt;LAN: Connecting between a K6-2 400 (Linux) and PIII
560 (Linux, Win2k) via 100Mbps Ethernet
</p><p>&lt;il&gt;Broadband: Connecting between a PIII 650 (Linux,
Win2k) and K6-2 400 (Linux) via 768kbps DSL</p><p>&lt;il&gt;Modem: Connecting between a P133 (Linux, Win98) and
a K6-2 400 (Linux) via 33.6kbps modem</p><p>I tested using all machines involved as both server and
client under all operating systems installed. Under Linux my test
applications were xterm, Netscape 4.7, KDE, StarOffice 5 and the
GIMP. Under Windows my test applications were command.com (or
cmd.exe when applicable), Internet Explorer 5.5, Microsoft Word
2000 and Adobe Photoshop. Both platforms used unmodified copies of
the current versions of VNC, 3.3.3r2/3.3.3r9 (Linux/Windows), both
available on the web site. The results were somewhat
predictable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a91450"></a>Installation and First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>Installing the VNC server on Linux is fairly simple; you can
run it out of the build directory if need be. Configuration of the
server is achieved by editing the vncserver Perl script to match
your system configuration, editing VNC's xstartup script to match
your preferred desktop configuration, and running vncpasswd to set
a password on the VNC server (it will refuse to run without one,
which given the nature of the application is a good thing to do)
Note that if you are using the Linux system as a client you don't
need to do any more in the way of installation than copying the
vncviewer program into a convenient location on your path. There
are a number of things you should configure before you start the
server, most importantly a password, the startup script, and
resolution and color depth. You should also ensure that the default
desktop that VNC loads does not use a pixmap as its desktop, as
this will degrade performance greatly.</p><p>Installing the Windows VNC server is similar to the setup
procedure of its Linux counterpart; unzip the installation files,
run the installer and you're done. As with the Linux version, if
you only want to use the viewer, you can simply copy vncviewer.exe
to a convenient location and not install the server. The user
interface of the Windows server will be somewhat easier for most
people to configure (configuration is available via an icon on the
taskbar). The one important limitation that manifests itself on the
Windows platform is that connecting to a Windows VNC server
connects you to the existing desktop visible on the console, rather
than a virtual desktop created for VNC. This is due to the
inherently single-user nature of the Windows UI, and there is no
simple way to fix this short of running a version of Windows like
NT Terminal Server Edition. Overall, though, installing VNC on a
Windows system should present little trouble.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a915b0"></a>Performance Tests</h2></div></div><p>My first test used my LAN configuration. Performance on this
setup (Linux on a K6-2 to and from Linux and Win2k on a PIII via
fast Ethernet at 1024x768 true color) was quite good when going
both ways, whether connecting Linux to Linux or using Windows as
the client or server (performance in all instances appeared to be
identical). While there was a slight but noticeable lag in updating
the screen, all of the test applications were quite usable (as one
would hope, given the connection over Fast Ethernet). The xterm
felt as fast as if it were local, StarOffice loaded and displayed
documents flawlessly, Netscape ran reasonably well, and the GIMP
was slow but usable. The Windows applications functioned similarly
with one exception, as explained at the end of this review. All in
all, LAN performance is more than acceptable.</p><p>My second test was on the broadband configuration. The
parameters of this test (Linux on a K6-2 to and from Linux and
Win2k on a PIII via 768k DSL at 1024x768 true color) are both
common and, as detailed below, quite sufficient for most
applications. The applications reflecting the most common usage
patterns&mdash;StarOffice and MS Word&mdash;both run acceptably over the DSL.
Both command-line environments
(<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> in xterm and cmd.exe) worked
fine and the web browsers were reasonably usable. This greatly
increases the usefulness of VNC, as many small (and not so small)
businesses as well as a fair number of home users rely on DSL or a
comparable link for connectivity. The applications that I found not
to work acceptably were the GIMP and Photoshop. Both choked the
connection while editing, which makes sense considering that a
full-screen bitmap photo at 1024x768x24 is more than two megabytes,
and editing a photo involves redrawing the screen repeatedly. Other
than the photo editing issue, however, I found that VNC was quite
usable over the DSL. For accessing most office productivity
applications, VNC over broadband performs acceptably.</p><p>The third and last test configuration consisted of the
aforementioned K6-2 connected to a Pentium 133 via 33.6kbps modem.
Due to my experience with the DSL connection, I deemed 1024x768 at
true color likely to be too bandwidth-intensive to work well at
modem speeds. Because the Pentium machine was a laptop with an
800x600 screen, I opted to use 800x600 at 16-bit color as the
screen mode of choice. Before I go into the details of this round
of testing, let me give you the one word summary: slow. To preserve
one's sanity, I would not recommend spending a lot of time running
VNC via modem. That said, basic applications ran without real
problems. StarOffice, Word and the two command lines all were
usable to a reasonable extent. Anything beyond that involved a
great deal of waiting. I attempted to run both Netscape and
Internet Explorer and, though both ran, they loaded pages so slowly
as to make early builds of Mozilla seem lightning fast in
comparison. The bottom line is that, while VNC does function over a
modem to a certain extent, I would not recommend using it as
anything other than a last-resort backup for your normal means of
access to the desired remote computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a917c0"></a>But What About X?</h2></div></div><p>After reading the above, I'm sure many readers are wondering
why they should bother with VNC when another excellent remote
access tool, the X Window System, is included in some form in
nearly all Linux distributions. This is a good question, and the
answer is straightforward. In certain scenarios VNC possesses
several strong advantages over X, specifically in cross-platform
support, security, client-side statelessness and client-side
resource usage. The first of these, cross-platform support, is
simple. While X servers exist for many platforms, they are often
neither free nor any variation of open source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a918c8"></a>Notes</h2></div></div><p>You may want to make a few modifications to your usage habits
to improve your productivity, primarily in the area of scrolling.
Because VNC is an abstract protocol and does not link to the
underlying graphics system (i.e., at the accelerator level), it
sees the screen as only a pixmap and does not follow what X or the
Windows GDI is doing. Because of this, you must redraw all changing
areas of the screen, even if you are simply scrolling a document.
Because of this, I would recommend you become accustomed to
scrolling by page instead of by line to minimize the amount of time
spent redrawing the screen (once per page rather than once for
every line scrolled). Common situations in which this makes a big
difference include paging through a spreadsheet or word processing
document full of charts and diagrams, scrolling through an image in
the GIMP or Photoshop or, if you are so possessed, browsing the Web
through VNC. This also becomes an issue in many Windows
applications that attempt to use Windows' smooth scrolling feature;
because of the way the GDI accelerates this function, VNC cannot
track the current screen image properly and will fail to draw the
screen correctly. A second workaround to this is to turn off
graphics acceleration in the Display Properties control panel under
the Troubleshooting tab of the advanced settings screen (accessible
via the Advanced button under the Settings tab). While this will
greatly slow video performance when working at the Windows
machine's console, VNC is far better able to correctly display and
refresh the screen with these settings. In a similar vein, having a
fast video card&mdash;or any video card for that matter&mdash;won't help you
under Linux. In fact you don't need a display adaptor of any kind
on a Linux VNC host because VNC creates its own virtual
display.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2999580.0x2a919d0"></a>The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>VNC is one of the more useful programs in existence. That it
is being developed by a group devoted to research (AT&amp;T
Laboratories Cambridge) and that it is available under the GPL are
both good points. VNC is well-suited for applications where remote
access to and from diverse platforms is needed, and I would
recommend it to anyone looking for a good graphical remote access
tool.</p></div></div>
