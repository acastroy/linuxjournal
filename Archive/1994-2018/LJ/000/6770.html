</p><p>Editors' Note: The following reader letter and author
response appeared in the February 2003 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>I received a copy of the article &ldquo;Free Software in Brazil&rdquo; by
Jon Hall, featured in the September 2002 <i  >LJ</i>,
from a friend who lives in the US and who was quite worried about
some things the article mentioned regarding what you call &ldquo;the
Landless Movement&rdquo; in Brazil.
</p><p>Although the cause of this movement may look noble, there are
many things related to this group that should have been considered
before publishing that article and stamping their flag on the
magazine's cover. The group, known here in Brazil as MST, has a
radical political position, and they are responsible for some
actions that could be seen as terrorist acts, such as mass killings
and unauthorized land occupation including invading and destroying
a farm that belongs to Brazil's president, Mr. Fernado Henrique
Cardoso. The group's default way of acting is by the use of brute
force, and they usually threaten people to get what they want.
Everything I'm mentioning here can be easily checked. A simple
search of major Brazilian newspapers will show that the MST isn't
worth trust or being featured on a magazine such as <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Mr. Jon Hall, with all due respect, should try
to find out better who he is supporting or featuring.</p><p>&mdash;Bruno Trevisan</p><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall replies:</p><p>The group of people that I was introduced to, and who appear
in the picture, were introduced to me by Mr. Marcos Mazoni, the
President and CEO of PROCERGS. PROCERGS is the government-owned
software company that is doing a lot of the open-source programming
for the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The group also showed up at the
third annual Software Livre! conference, which was sponsored in
part by PROCERGS and attended by the Mayor of Porto Alegre and a
representative from UNESCO. There was no mention or indication that
this was a &ldquo;terrorist group&rdquo;. However, in light of Mr. Trevisan's
letter I went back to Brazil and did some more research, both
directly and indirectly, by reading, by talking to people who I
trust and by doing a little web-scouring of my own.</p><p>In Brazil about 60% of the land is owned by 1% of the
population. A lot of this land lies idle, while millions of people
are out of work and have no way to generate money or food. Since
1984 MST has won land for approximately 250,000 families in 1,600
settlements, but there are still another 4.8 million families
without the means to support themselves.</p><p>MST is building cooperatives, building agroindustries,
building and staffing day care centers, teaching literacy classes
to 25,000 adults, helping to educate 150,000 children in 1,200
public schools. And they are proud of their non-violent direct
action in the form of land occupations.</p><p>I have lived through quite a few other &ldquo;actions&rdquo; in my
lifetime. The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and the
anti-Vietnam war movement come to mind. Both of these had their
peaceful incidents and incidents that were not so peaceful.
However, to judge a whole movement and its motives by the actions
of a small minority of them is wrong.</p><p>If the whole movement of the MST is indeed bad, and if they
are indeed terrorists, than I have good company in the number of
people and agencies that have been duped by them. It appears that
UNESCO, the Catholic Church, and even parts of former president
Cardoso's own judiciary and elected officials supported the
MST.</p><p>Actually, from the documentation I found, it seems that the
non-peaceful and &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; actions seems to have come from the
former government of Brazil, with the killing of many of the
protesters by government forces and the lack of action by the
government in holding their killers responsible. One article
written by Mark S. Lagevin, a professor of Global Studies at
Pacific Western University, says there were 969 assassinations of
rural workers and MST activists, with only five people convicted of
those crimes. Hopefully the new government will be more
responsive.</p><p>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the Brazilian Worker's Party
(PT) is now the President of Brazil. In the past the PT has helped
to support the MST in its quest for land reform, and I hope this
continues.</p><p>Not relying on only newspaper articles and web sites, I asked
several of my Brazilian friends what they thought of the MST
movement. Each of them stated that while they deplore any type of
violence, the good that the MST movement generates is many times
better than the reported bad actions of a few and that the past
government had not been responsive to more than reasonable requests
for land reform. Therefore, they supported the MST overall.</p><p>However, I was informed by a friend in Sao Paulo that
representatives of Microsoft were taking copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i> to people in business and telling them that I
was not an honorable person because I was associated with the MST
group, and by default if I am not honorable, then the Open Source
movement must not be honorable. Therefore, I would like to set the
record straight as to what type of person I am.</p><p>I believe in free speech, a democratic process and freedom of
choice. I believe in non-violence and have never physically hurt
anyone in anger. I have never been in jail, never been arrested and
have received only two speeding tickets in my entire life (which I
paid). I do not believe that killing a human being for anything
less than immediate threat of life (my own or another person's) is
ever justified, yet I would go to war to protect my country and its
ideals if we were attacked. I believe in equality of the races and
sexes, and I believe in honoring diversity in religion and sexual
orientation. I believe that the duty of government is to honor the
will of the majority as long as it does not violate the rights of
the minority. I honor laws, even those that I am not completely
happy about, believing that it is better to change them than to
break them. I encourage people to think about what the law means,
and what it would be like if there were no laws. Finally, I have
never even been accused in court (local, state or federal) of being
a monopoly, breaking the law or knowingly harming another person's
business or the consumer by my business tactics.</p><p>As for my association with the MST group and my picture
alongside their flag, I repeat that my interest was in seeing
people who had little money and great ideals using a free and open
operating system to help their cause and better their lives. On
this path I will continue to walk.</p><p>With respect to Mr. Trevisan, I have encouraged
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to publish his letter and this
response. For those of you who are interested in the MST movement,
I offer their web site at
