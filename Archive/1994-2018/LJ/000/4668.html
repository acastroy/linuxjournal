    There was a time when IT professionals questioned the need for an intrusion detection system (IDS). Most people then thought that a firewall was adequate protection against malicious attacks. Security has now evolved to a point where there is a widespread awareness in the IT community regarding the need for IDS. One such IDS is Snort. Snort is a free, small, highly configurable and portable network-based IDS or NIDS. Additionally, Snort can be used as a packet sniffer and a packet logger.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Snort is often referred to as a
lightweight intrusion detection system. Snort is labeled
lightweight because it is designed primarily for small network
segments. Snort is very flexible due to its rule-based
architecture. The designers of Snort have made it very easy to
insert and expand upon rules as new security threats are detected.
This article will detail the Snort installation, architecture,
rules and how to run it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3240"></a>Snort Installation</h2></div></div><p>Snort was written by Martin Roesch and can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.Snort.org" target="_self">www.Snort.org</a> by
selecting the Downloads link on the left panel. As of this writing,
the latest version of Snort is 1.7. The Snort web site will provide
you with the ability to download binaries for some of the common
platforms as well as source code. But before you download and try
to install/compile Snort, you will need libpcap version 0.5 or
higher. The latest version of libpcap is 0.6.2. It allows for
system-independent packet capture and analysis. Libpcap is
available on some BSD platforms. You may download the latest
version of libpcap from
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org" target="_self">www.tcpdump.org</a>.</p><p>Installation of Snort is fairly straightforward. As with
installing any typical UNIX tools, it involves running ./configure
followed by make. I always like to view the configure options.
Typing <b  >./configure -help</b> will display the
available options. Typing <b  >make install</b> will
install all of the Snort files. However, you are still not ready to
run Snort. Prior to running Snort you will have to build its rules
file. But before we go on to write the rules file, let's review the
Snort architecture.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da3500"></a>Snort Architecture</h2></div></div><p>The Snort architecture consists of three principal
components. A simplified representation of these components is
shown in Figure 1. They are described below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Packet Decoder: the Snort packet decoder supports
the Ethernet, SLIP and PPP mediums. The packet decoder performs all
the work to prepare the data in an expedient manner for the
detection engine.</p></li><li><p>Detection Engine: the detection engine is at the
heart of Snort. It essentially is responsible for analyzing every
packet based on the Snort rules that are loaded at runtime. The
detection engine separates the Snort rules into what is referred to
as a chain header and chain options. The common attributes such as
source/destination IP address and ports identify the chain header.
The chain options are defined by details such as the TCP flags,
ICMP code types, specific type of content, payload size, etc. The
detection engine recursively analyzes each and every packet based
on the rules defined in the Snort rules file. The first rule that
matches the decoded packet triggers the action specified in the
rule definition. A packet that does not match any Snort rule set is
simply discarded. Key components of the detection engine are the
plugin modules such as the portscan module. Plugin modules enhance
the functionality of Snort by adding to the analysis
capability.</p></li><li><p>Logger/Alerter: logging and alerting are two
separate subcomponents. Logging allows you to log the information
collected by the packet decoder in human readable or tcpdump
format. You can configure alerts to be sent to syslog, flat file,
UNIX sockets or a database. Optionally, you may turn off alerting
completely during testing or penetration studies. By default, all
logs are written in the /var/log/Snort folder, and all of the
alerts are written to the /var/log/Snort/alerts file.</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4668f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Snort Rules
</p></div></div><p>The Snort rules file is an ASCII file that can be created
using your favorite editor. The contents of the rules file consist
of the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Variable Definitions: these define variables that
may be reused in creating Snort rules.</p></li><li><p>Snort Rules: these are the actual rules that
enables intrusion detection. These should be consistent with the
overall Intrusion Detection policy. Snort rules are defined later
in this section.</p></li><li><p>Preprocessor: these are synonymous with plugins and
are instrumental in extending the capability of Snort. For example,
the portscan module allows Snort to detect port scans.</p></li><li><p>Include Files: these allow you to include other
Snort rules files.</p></li><li><p>Output Modules: these allow the Snort administer to
specify the output for logging and alerting. The output modules are
run when the alert or logging subsystems of Snort are
called.</p></li></ul></div><p>Snort rules consist of two logical parts: the rule header and
options. Snort rules must be specified on a single line.
Additionally, Snort rules must contain IP addresses, as a hostname
lookup is not performed. Figure 2 shows the Snort rule header and
options details.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4668f2.large.jpg"><img src="4668f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Rule Header and
Options Details</b></span></p></div></div><p>Readers interested in the details of Snort rules are referred
to the &ldquo;Writing Snort Rules&rdquo; link on the Snort page. In addition,
the Snort distribution provides a RULES.SAMPLE file that is very
well documented. This file displays the Snort rules that you can
play with to build the Snort rules file for your environment.
Before writing Snort rules it is recommended that you document your
NIDS policy. This involves identifying the activity that you wish
to log, ignore or be alerted of upon detection. A very simple
policy is documented below and its corresponding rules file is
displayed in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4668l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The Snort Rules File for
Our Policy</a></p><p>Log on the following activity from any host not belonging to
our network: Telnet attempts, FTP traffic, and finger attempts.
Alert on the following: portscan attempts activity from any host
not belonging to our network to th e /var/log/snort/pscan_alerts
file, all PHF requests only and all DNS version queries. Pass
(Ignore) on the following: all UDP port access above port 1024, all
web browsing traffic originating from our network and all ssh
traffic to the NIDS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da4210"></a>Running Snort</h2></div></div><p>Snort can be run as a packet sniffer, packet logger and as an
NIDS. When Snort is run as a packet sniffer, TCP/UDP/ICMP header
information and application data is dumped on the standard
output:</p><p><b  ># Snort -vd</b></p><p>As a packet logger, Snort logs application and protocol
header information to /var/log/today.log:</p><p><b  ># Snort -dev -l /var/log/today.log</b></p><p>As an NIDS, Snort listens on the le0 interface and uses
/etc/Snort.rules as its configuration file and runs Snort in
d&aelig;mon mode:</p><p><b  ># Snort -D -i le0 -c
/etc/Snort.rules</b></p><p>Snort does not evaluate the rules in the order that they
appear in the Snort rules file. All actions specified in the Snort
rules file are evaluated in the order of Alert, Pass and Log by
default. If you wish to change this order to Pass, Alert, Log, use
the -o command-line flag. The -A option specifies the alert mode.
There are four choices here: full, fast, none and unsock. The full,
fast and none options are rather obvious. The unsock option
provides Snort the ability to write to UNIX sockets where a program
listening on that socket may process the alerts. Details of these
options are available in the Snort man pages. With Snort alert
modes, you will have the ability to specify the detail that you
wish to view in your alert messages.</p><p>Be sure to validate your snort configuration. To validate, we
must revisit the IDS policy. A few rules of thumb to validate your
IDS are provided. Based on the IDS policy, you could launch
specific tests and observe logs and alerts. For our policy listed
above, we could launch Telnet, FTP and finger. You could use tools
such as a scanner. Publicly available scanners, such as nmap, are
good ones. Commercial scanners such as Cybercop from Network
Associates and ISS scanner from Internet Security Systems can help
you automate the process as well. Netcat, available from
<a href="http://www.atstake.com/researchtools" target="_self">www.atstake.com/researchtools/</a>,
is another great utility. Finally, you could use
several scripts written for script kiddies to launch attacks
against your own infrastructure. However, tread cautiously, as
running those scripts implies that you trust those scripts. Listing
2 shows a few sample alerts. It shows three common attacks: IIS
Unicode attack, SYN/FIn Scan and a portscan.</p><p><a href="4668l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Common Snort
Alerts</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cab580.0x1da4790"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>First it was the sophisticated hacker, then came the script
kiddy and distributed denial of service (DOS) attacks. Today's IT
infrastructure and business assets are under constant threat of
unauthorized access. Firewalls were the primary mechanism to shield
against attacks on corporate assets during the early 1990s. Modern
security architectures are increasingly including IDSes. Snort
provides a very cost effective alternative to commercial
IDSes.</p><p>Once compiled and installed, Snort can be run as a sniffer,
packet logger and a network based IDS. Snort is easy to configure
and provides multiple output modules for alerting and logging.
Plugin modules developed by the Snort community further enhance
Snort's ability. If you were able to get Snort up and running,
watch your logs and alerts to gain insight into the type of traffic
captured by Snort!</p><p><a href="4668s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Nalneesh Gaur</b></span> is a Technical
