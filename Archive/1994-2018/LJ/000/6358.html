    A plethora of applications, streamlined installation and
    increased performance make putting Debian on your desktop easier than
    ever.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110e580.0x1206190"></a></h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Debian on Steroids&rdquo; is how a member of a
Linux mail list I frequent responded to my description of the
Libranet 2.7 beta. With the 2.4.19 kernel, KDE 3.0.3, Gnome 2.0.1,
Open Office 1.0.1 and a well groomed selection of Debian
applications, Libranet 2.7 is an easy-to-install, muscular
distribution that should tempt anyone curious about Debian.</p><p>While classic Debian can be downloaded or obtained on
inexpensive CDs, a commercial release like Libranet 2.7 justifies
its cost by streamlining the installation and configuration of
Debian, a process with an intimidating reputation. Libranet offers
a straightforward installer, simplified partitioning, automatic
detection and configuration of video and sound, system
administration tools and a well organized selection of
applications, all of which get a generously endowed Debian
installation up and running in short order. And since Libranet is
fully compatible with Debian, it offers fast and reliable system
updates and upgrades.</p><p>On a system with an 850MHz Celeron processor, installation
using the two provided CDs takes less than an hour. Partitioning
can be either fully automatic, i.e. taking over the entire HD, or
specified to available free space. Libranet 2.7 boasts a new
partitioning tool that reminds me of the old SuSE YAST, but greatly
simplified. The ReiserFS is the default, but ext2 or ext3
filesystems also may be selected. In addition, you can run
<span   class="bold"><b>GNU/parted</b></span> from within the
partitioning utility to resize a VFAT or ext2 partition to make
room.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6358f1.large.jpg"><img src="6358f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>The installer then makes the necessary initial installation,
inquires if you want Libranet to handle booting duties with its
GRUB, offers to make a boot floppy and then reboots.</p><p>Users of the previous Libranet release will be pleased to
know that the CD swapping exercise is no more. After inserting CD
#1 and selecting from a menu of package groups, Libranet now asks
to have CD #2 inserted only one time, and that's it.</p><p>Sound and video set up follow. Libranet differs from classic
Debian by autodetecting and configuring the sound card, mouse,
video card and monitor. The Libranet installer had no problem with
the onboard sound on my Celeron and Athlon systems. Not
surprisingly, it could not detect the ancient ISA Sound Blaster 16
card on my P233 box, but after manually selecting the card from the
list, the module loaded without complaint.</p><p>Next up is networking or dial-up configuration. You can set
up a firewall after installation using Adminmenu, Libranet's system
administration utility that further distinguishes it from classic
Debian.</p><p>

</p><p>Libranet then offers to configure your IDE CD burner to
emulate SCSI, essential if you intend to use one of the various
burning applications provided. I happen to like XCDRoast, and for
CD-to-CD copying, both CD drives need to be configured for SCSI
emulation. Luckily, the installer provides an option to do this for
you.</p><p>Next comes configuring X. Libranet now advises not to move
the mouse while detecting. It had no problem correctly identifying
and configuring the wheel rodents on my systems. Video card
detection also is reliable for the cards currently supported by
Xfree86 4.2. If you change your video card after installing
Libranet 2.7, it will autodetect the new hardware and reconfigure
X.</p><p>I found the generic monitor settings worked well. I have a
label with scan frequencies on all of my monitors and usually enter
the values manually, but I actually found the canned settings
worked better. My manual settings sometimes resulted in off-center
displays, while the generic settings were dead on at my preferred
800 x 600 resolution. YMMV, of course, so you can tinker and test
settings either during the installation or by using the elegant
Libranet Adminmenu utility after the installation has
completed.</p><p>Libranet provides the desktop user with a multitude of word
processing packages. Koffice is there, of course, as is OpenOffice,
replacing Star Office 5.2 from the previous release. Libranet also
includes the latest release of Abiword, 1.0.2, an endearing word
processor that keeps getting better.</p><p>My favorite word processor is WordPerfect 8. Libranet thinks
installing WP should not be a hassle, so, like SuSE, Libranet 2.7
includes a compatibility package group to support Linux
WordPerfect. It's listed at the bottom of the package group menu,
but it's not a problem if you overlooked it. Simply run Adminmenu
and add it later. I installed all versions of WordPerfect 8 and 8.1
(the version included on my Corel Linux deluxe CD) without any
difficulty. Instructions for doing this, as well as other useful
tips, are listed in the Support Solutions Database on the
<a href="http://www.libranet.com" target="_self">Libranet web
site</a>.</p><p>For fans of Applix Office, installation is not a problem
either. No, you don't have to convert every Applix RPM to Debian.
Libranet provides onboard support for RPMs. All you need to do is
create the directory /var/lib/rpm and run the command <b  >rpm
-initdb</b>. Libranet is then ready to install RPM packages,
although converting them with Joey Hess' Alien utility is
preferable.</p><p>On the down side, there are a few bugs to deal with. Libranet
can detect a Windows partition and write the appropriate line in
/etc/fstab. A mountpoint, /windows, also is listed, but
unfortunately, Libranet did not actually create it. But that's easy
enough to fix: simply create /windows. And while you're at it, you
might as well create /burn or the like for XCDROAST to store its
image files. You should check the CD-ROM lines in /etc/fstab. I
typically set up both drives for SCSI emulation. With this
configuration, Libranet had my CD-ROM mounted to /cdrom1 and the
second drive, a CD burner, mounted to /cdrom. This will have no
effect other than confusing the CUPS installer in Adminmenu. Either
edit /etc/fstab or put the CD in the second drive when the CUPS
installer asks for CD2. The Adminmenu utility also can rescan your
CD drives and assign the default.</p><p>I found a very noticeable speed-up running Libranet 2.7 on my
900MHz Athlon system. Applications load noticeably faster than with
Libranet 2 on my Athlon. One mail group correspondent reports that
Libranet &ldquo;blows the socks off&rdquo; Red Hat 7.3.</p><p>Along with a collection of up-to-date applications, the
latest kernel, video support, a choice of window managers (KDE,
GNOME, Xfce, IceWM, etc.) and Adminmenu's comprehensive system
tools, Libranet 2.7 provides a smooth ride to high-power Debian
Linux for both the neophyte and the experienced user.</p></div></div>
