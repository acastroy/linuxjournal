    Jason Schumaker rolls out the first inaugural &amp;quot;Lighter Side of Linuxworld&amp;quot; Awards.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222e580.0x2326138"></a></h2></div></div><p>LinuxWorld is quickly fading from memory.
The show has been over for nearly a week, and it is now time to
turn my attention back to the production of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. But, while I was sitting at my desk (at home,
after hours), thinking of a quick piece to nicely wrap up the show
that was, I came up with (after a six-pack of Guinness and two
episodes of <a href="http://www.baywatchtv.com" target="_self">Baywatch
Hawaii</a>) this: Jason's Lighter Side of the LinuxWorld Awards
&reg;-- NYC 2000. While awards for best hardware or software are
important from a user perspective or vendor perspective, these
awards have very little value. If there <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a
value, it is to show the lighter side of our community. That's
all.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Most Sexist, Yet Effective
Booth</b></span>: This one goes to the FreeBSD team. In case you
haven't heard, there were three (maybe four) rather curvaceous
women wearing red vinyl suits, complete with devil horns. They
handed out free wares, including little Styrofoam devil horns,
which also included the recipient having their picture taken with
the girls. I ripped FreeBSD in an earlier report from the show, and
received a few nasty letters. While I still think the idea was
lame, I certainly admit that seeing the women every morning was
like a second cup of coffee.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>The Most Annoying
Booth</b></span>: Without question, it goes to SCO. Their special
brand of rap/funk/crap was commendable only for the amount of
courage shown by those in the band. Condolences go out to the
people at the Hewlett-Packard booth, who were a mere bass pop from
the speakers. HP lost one boothperson to a nervous breakdown, and
are still assessing the damage done to their IA64-run
cluster!</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Best Breakfast</b></span>
(meaning, they paid): This one goes to Illiad and the User Friendly
Media team. Doc Searls and myself found our way to the Fitzpatrick
Hotel at 8AM Thursday morning. Crusty-eyed and bitchin' for coffee,
we settled in to a wonderful breakfast, and a stimulating
discussion about the future of UF. The overall theme was of a
highly secretive nature (the next Transmeta?) that may be the next
logical link toward World Domination.</p></li></ul></div><p>I am always amazed at how much coffee I can drink, which
brings me to the next award.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>My award for the <span   class="bold"><b>Most
Important Morning/Afternoon Stimulant</b></span>: This one was
hotly contested. I have to mention that the girls at the Stormix
booth nearly pulled off the upset. However, the award goes to,
that's right&mdash;Coffee! Wherever I found it, be it at my hotel, the
morning bagel stop, at the stand inside the convention center, or
just sitting somewhere unattended, I felt it had somehow made me
whole.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Most /. -able and
Unsubstantiated Rumor</b></span>: this goes to someone, who shall
remain nameless (namely because I forgot their name), that said
&ldquo;...the folks from /. are riding a mighty high horse over there
next to VA Linux.&rdquo; Okay... I didn't get a chance to visit with the
/. group, but I sure could have used an hour or so in one of their
beanbag chairs.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wealthiest Person Who Walked
Past Me Without Acknowledging My Presence</b></span>: Robert Young
of RHAT. Not sure what he would have said to me, but I was hurt
nonetheless. (Incidentally, second place went to Mario Cuomo. He
wasn't at LinuxWorld, but WAS on my flight home. Some might argue
that Mario could have more money, but his not sitting in first
class would seem to indicate otherwise. Like you care.)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Award for
Hypocrisy</b></span>: This one goes to ME, for calling FreeBSD
classless and sexist for the devil girls in red vinyl, then
referring to the women of Stormix as 1) girls, and 2)
stimulants.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Biggest
Misjudgment</b></span> (that inadvertently shed a negative light on
Linux in the minds of media other than that from the community):
IDG gets this one. Even though they put on a good show, they
provided only one computer running Linux (which I didn't see) in
the press room. I asked Kristin DeAngelis, marketing manager at
IDG, to explain. She said, &ldquo;We provide for everyone, but we need to
especially provide for the majority to make sure the maximum
information about the show can get out to the public.&rdquo; I am really
not meaning to bash IDG (or Kristin), but this is a Linux show, and
when the &ldquo;other press&rdquo; is in our house, they should use our OS. IDG
is basically showing that Linux isn't ready to get the information
out, which is simply not true. There were probably 14 computers
running Windows, which I haven't really used before. I lost whole
paragraphs while working on articles (I still don't understand
how), but was never treated to the blue screen of death.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Coolest Mascot</b></span>:
The User Friendly Dust Puppy! Find some pictures, if you haven't
already seen it. A very close second was the SuSE lizard, who tried
to bite me!</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>The Friendliest
Booth</b></span>: How do you pick this one? Everyone was nice,
except the people from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Magazine</em></span> (I'm
probably just joking). Still, the votes are in, and the winner
is... Merlin Software. They had a Merlin Software pinball machine,
cool hats and just damn friendly folk, that is until I pointed out
the alarming similarities between their logo and that of newcomer
LinuxWizardary. Judge Judy has been contacted.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Best Impersonation of Richard
M. Stallman</b></span>: Hands down, this award goes to Alan Cox. If
it wasn't for the red hat (and the fact that I knew it was Alan
Cox), I would have sworn I was standing a mere five feet from RMS.
Has anyone actually seen them together?</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Best T-Shirt</b></span>: I
don't know where I got it, but simplicity of design always gets me.
The award goes to the &ldquo;Chicks Dig UNIX&rdquo; shirt. A black t-shirt with
a simple white design. Nothing on the back, and the shirt isn't six
sizes too big.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tastiest Typo</b></span>:
Appgen Business Software, Inc. Thanks to them for handing out the
Appgen candy bars, but a close examination of the back stated that
&ldquo;Linux is a registered trademark of Linux Torvalds.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Best Question</b></span>
(directed at Linus, during his keynote): Will Bruce Pehrens please
come forward to accept this award? His question: &ldquo;I have an old
laptop and I would like to play DVDs on it.&rdquo; (said in a
what-would-you-recommend-I-do tone)</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Best Failed &ldquo;Acquisition&rdquo;
Attempt</b></span>: The last award, and it seems only fitting to
close with a category that addresses one of the hottest topics
swarming around Linux. This award goes to RHAT (big surprise!) for
their failed attempt at acquiring Eric Raymond. The deal,
reportedly worth $2.1 million in an RHAT-owned stock medley, was
nixed by Raymond, as he was quoted as saying, &ldquo;Part of the deal was
that I had to wear one of those f*#kin' red hats. Anyway, $2.1
million is bupkes. I was holding out for one of the BSD
wenches!&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><p>Well, that's that. The show was a success by all standards.
Linux is rising, rising, rising and <i  >Linux Journal</i> will be there for every step, leap, acquisition
and IPO! Perhaps I will see you at the next show...</p></div></div>
