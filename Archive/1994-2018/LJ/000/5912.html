    Thanks to geeks with portable WiFi base
    stations, the air was filled with Net love all over SXSW in Austin.
    Then Hollywood moved in. And neither faction was anywhere in sight at
    the Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17ac348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last week started with a missed plane in
Denver, so I didn't catch
<a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/tech_report/_archives/tuesday.php" target="_self">Lawrence
Lessig's opening keynote at the SXSW</a> conference in Austin,
Texas. But when I showed up on Sunday morning, it was clear that he
had set the agenda, not only for the next few days, but for the Net
itself and the fight to keep it free. (For more about what Larry is
up to, check <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig" target="_self">his
home page</a>.)</p><p>I was in a fighting mood myself, having just written two
hotly worded pieces
(<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q1/000016.html" target="_self">&ldquo;The
Choice&rdquo;</a> and <a href="../000/5901.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Bizarre vs.
Bazaar&rdquo;</a>) for <i  >LJ</i>. SXSW seemed like just
the place to meet the enemy and party hard at the same time&mdash;a
convenience made possible by the presence of The Enemy in our own
heads. More about that in a moment.</p><p>By Friday of the same week, I was at the
<a href="http://www.esconline.com/sf" target="_self">Embedded Systems
Conference</a> in San Francisco, which seemed a world away in
time. It was a big conference, filling most of both the North and
South Halls at the Moscone Center. Linux was huge here. Domination
of the embedded world looks no less inevitable, in spite of the
huge Microsoft and Wind River booths, which stood out like boulders
in the stream of history. And after talking with Inder Singh of the
<a href="http://www.embedded-linux.org/organization.php3" target="_self">Embedded
Linux Consortium</a> (and
<a href="http://lynuxworks" target="_self">Lynuxworks</a>) on Thursday, I'm
convinced the stream is quickly turning into a river. After awhile,
it'll be an ocean.</p><p>Yet, except for a few Windows terminals in the halls, the ESC
had all the connectivity of a parking garage. Remarkably few of the
booths feature a Net connection, and the press room had only a
couple of dial-up lines, four Windows boxes and a printer. I
brought along a wireless base station that the good folks at
<a href="http://www.kvo.com" target="_self">KVO</a>, which ran the press
room, were happy to see. Unfortunately, the Net was distributed to
the boxes by some Microsoft MSN intranet thing, rather than the
DHCP one usually finds at venues like this. So here I was, writing
this in a parking garage, with live internet access provided by the
Starbucks on the ground floor. Knock Starbucks all you like, but
somehow they've managed to be more forward-thinking regarding WiFi
than the embedded world's leading conference. Go figure.</p><p>In fact, that's just what I did. I figured that there are
basically three cultures at play in our heads.</p><p>One is purely technical. It's pre-Net, pre-UNIX and maybe
even pre-cultural. It shows up where raw technology meets the real
world, and its concerns are utterly practical. &ldquo;Here's the
problem&rdquo;, it says. &ldquo;Let's solve it&rdquo;. This is a heads-down culture
and civilization depends on it. Embedded systems are what run our
cash registers and brake systems, our airplane guidance systems,
our factory robotics, our flow meters, our stoplights and our
heating systems. The Net and Linux are both handy ways to solve
countless embedded systems problems&mdash;extremely handy, it turns out.
One morning at SXSW I read that embedded Linux will soon run in
something like 60,000 cash registers at Home Depot. It's a big
story, but mostly a technical one. Does Home Depot give a damn
about Linux as a cause? Or about the lawmaking that threatens to
turn the Net into nothing more than a backbone for industrial-grade
commerce, plus a bunch of culverts for moving &ldquo;content&rdquo; stamped and
sanitized by ubiquitous digital content management? I kind of doubt
it.</p><p>The other two cultures are the geeks and the entertainment
industry, what Larry Lessig and others like to characterize
geographically as Silicon Valley and Hollywood.</p><p>The geeks built the Net and want to keep it free. Hollywood
wants to control it. That's the basic conflict. Since the
beginning, the geeks have had resolute faith in the Net's ability
to resist control by government and commercial interests. Geeks
interpret attempts at control as mere problems the Net will
naturally route around. The same goes for Linux, which has proven
handy for extending the Net upward into the operating system and
outward into the world. That geek philosophy was manifest in John
Perry Barlow's &ldquo;
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/barlow_0296.declaration" target="_self">A
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>&rdquo;, even six
years after it was written in February 1996. The provocations have
changed, but the sides remain the same. And, like I said, those
sides dwell in our own heads. Tim O'Reilly talks about this in his
weblog entry,
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1209" target="_self">&ldquo;Disingenuous
Comments from Michael Eisner&rdquo;</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>First, as the CEO of one of the country's largest
and most successful computer book publishers, I am in a unique
position to see both sides of this issue. My business is content
and copyright, just like Disney's, but my subject matter is
technology. And I want to go on record as saying unequivocally that
the Silicon Valley perspective on this issue has far more substance
to it than the Hollywood/Nashville/New York version. The
legislation currently being explored in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, to require computer makers to build copy-protection into
its products, is extremely ill-conceived.</p></blockquote></div><p>&ldquo;Conceived&rdquo; is the operative word here. We conceive things,
cognitive scientists tell us, metaphorically. Our conceptual
metaphors are almost entirely unconscious, yet they drive entire
vocabularies. When we call the Net a &ldquo;space&rdquo; or a &ldquo;place&rdquo;, with
&ldquo;sites&rdquo; and &ldquo;locations&rdquo; with &ldquo;addresses&rdquo; (some of which we call
&ldquo;home&rdquo;), we are using a vocabulary induced by a conceptual
metaphor&mdash;the Net is a place. Prepositions are big give-aways for
conceptual metaphors. We go <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> the Net, not
<span   class="emphasis"><em>through</em></span> it.</p><p>But place isn't the only conceptual metaphor for the Net. We
also call it a &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;, in which we &ldquo;load&rdquo; stuff called &ldquo;content&rdquo;
that we &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; or &ldquo;stream&rdquo; to an &ldquo;end user&rdquo;, as if the whole
thing were a vast container cargo system. That's Hollywood's view,
even though geeks use plenty of that same vocabulary.</p><p>When Larry Lessig calls the Net a &ldquo;creative commons&rdquo;, he's
conceiving it as place, not as pipes. By coincidence, the same
place metaphor and its vocabulary also describes the business
commons we call a marketplace. The geeks who made the Net tend to
come from the place-based metaphorical system because they invented
it, vocabulary and all.</p><p>A couple years back Craig Burton
<a href="http://www.linuxforsuits.com/lfs_columns/2000_08-burton_interview.html" target="_self">described</a>
the Net this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I see the Net as a world we might see as a
bubble. A sphere. It's growing larger and larger, and yet inside
every point in that sphere is visible to every other one. That's
the architecture of a sphere. Nothing stands between any two
points. That's its virtue: it's empty in the middle. The distance
between any two points is functionally zero; and not just because
they can see each other, but because nothing interferes with
operation between any two points. There's a word I like for what's
going on here: terraform. It's the verb for creating a world.
That's what we're making here: a new world. Now the question is:
what are we going to do to cause planetary existence? How can we
terraform this new world in a way that works for the world and not
just ourselves? Remember, this thing is in outer space. It's not
connected to anything else. If you want to live here, you have to
bring your own sustaining structures, foods and the rest of
it.</p></blockquote></div><p>In that same vein, on Tuesday night, Monty of Ogg Vorbis said
this to me at Lovejoys, a terrific brewpub in Austin, &ldquo;It's called
cyberspace, not cyberpipes!&rdquo; So geeks totally understand Larry when
he talks about the commons.</p><p>But by the metaphorical logic of the second system, the
commons is just an intellectual conceit, a way to finesse (Michael
Eisner's word) the real issues, which are about who owns what and
how it moves from one party to another. Witness
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/technology/14PROT.html" target="_self">Piracy,
or Innovation? It's Hollywood vs. High Tech</a>&rdquo;, by Amy Harmon
in the March 14th edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New York
Times</em></span>. Here's one paragraph:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The feud grows out of Hollywood's frustration
with the illicit flow of copyrighted works over the Internet.
Despite courtroom victories against Napster and others deemed to
contribute to Internet piracy, millions of people continue to
download free digital copies of everything from Jennifer Lopez's
latest hit single to the Disney movie &ldquo;Monsters, Inc.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Observe the language: &ldquo;flow&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;download&rdquo;. By this
description, the Net is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>medium</em></span>. It is no
different, fundamentally, from TV, radio, newspapers and magazines.
It differs mostly in its ability to transport larger quantities of
digital content and, more importantly, to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>account</em></span> for that content. To content producers
looking to protect their intellectual property from &ldquo;theft&rdquo;, the
Net is just a vastly capable freight forwarding system with a
rather major inventory shrinkage problem that needs to be fixed. By
this thinking, there is no reason not to have digital rights
management (DRM) everywhere, keeping track of every stream and
every file that moves between producers and consumers and keeping
track of every intermediary that adds value along the way.</p><p>That's the thinking behind the
<a href="http://www.aftra.org/resources/pr/1101/back.html" target="_self">DRPA</a>,
the <a href="http://anti-dmca.org" target="_self">DMCA</a> and the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">CARP
Report</a>. All three of these instruments have kindly
recognized artists' rights to be compensated when their work is
performed, and they love the Net's ability to do what old-fashioned
broadcasting could not, which is account for everything that
happens on it. That's why the CARP Report sees internet
broadcasting as nothing more than a way to pipe recorded
performances to a known number of individuals and to charge the
distributor for the privilege. It imagines a pay-per-view scheme in
which the station pays. Presumably the station will make money by
marking up the goods they pass along to those final customers we'd
rather call &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;. That nobody has yet developed the
technologies for this is of no concern. What matters is that a
business could show up here. If it does, these guys want a piece of
the action. And if demanding that piece kills any chance internet
radio might ever have of being a business, so what?</p><p>Hence, the fight.</p><p>SXSW brings together three overlapping communities:
<a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive" target="_self">Interactive</a>
(March 8-13), <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/music" target="_self">Music</a>
(March 13-17) and
<a href="http://www.sxsw.com/film" target="_self">Film</a> (March 8-17). I
was there for the Interactive portion. So was Don Marti. And so
were a hearty assortment of geeks from the
<a href="http://www.austinlug.org" target="_self">Austin Linux Users
Group</a> and the <a href="http://austinwireless.net" target="_self">Austin
Wireless Group</a>, which treated the tradeshow floor to free
wall-to-wall wireless access. The AustinLUG folks say theirs is the
second-largest LUG in the US. However it ranks, it's hard to beat
their enthusiasm and involvement in the show. The same goes for the
large coterie of geeks who sat around hacking in the meeting rooms
and outside in the hallways.
<a href="http://boingboing.net" target="_self">Cory Doctorow</a> and
<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com" target="_self">Wes Felter</a> (who
lives in Austin) brought along WiFi base stations, which they
hooked up to the hubs that were already putting out DHCP for
panelists who felt like using laptops in front of the rooms. Cory
was also a
<a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/keynotes" target="_self">keynoter</a>,
along with
<a href="http://www.forthnet.gr/forthnet/isoc/short.history.of.internet" target="_self">Bruce
Sterling</a>.</p><p>Don was on the &ldquo;Politics of Open Source&rdquo;, which was more
about Linux than open source. Don did a great job, I thought,
especially at educating both the panel and the audience about Linux
and its various licensing schemes. I was on the &ldquo;P2P Journalism&rdquo;
panel, which was mostly about the difference between the &ldquo;little-j&rdquo;
journalism one finds in weblogs and the &ldquo;big-J&rdquo; Journalism one
finds in serious publications like <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It was all interesting stuff, but the bigger
story&mdash;to me at least&mdash;was the conflict between Hollywood and
Silicon Valley, between pipes and place.</p><p>After I got to San Francisco on Wednesday, I received an
e-mail from a guy who said he enjoyed my panel and added
this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I'm currently still at SXSW and attending the
Music festival. There are quite a few panels on the issue of
digital music, copyright, file sharing, etc., and more than a few
of them seem designed to spread some FUD among artists in the
trenches who don't get the Web. One in particular is the &ldquo;Copyright
in the Courts and Congress&rdquo; panel, which includes a discussion of
the recent royalty adjustments against internet radio (which you've
been talking about for the past weeks) and whether it goes too far
or not far enough.</p></blockquote></div><p>To me that's like asking if torture goes too far or not far
enough. The right answer is neither. But I'm on the geek side of
this thing.</p><p>As I wrote this, I was back in the press room at ESC,
connected over a dial-up line. While I was sitting here wrapping
this thing up, <a href="../095/5698.html" target="_self">Rick Lehrbaum</a>
came by. I asked him what he thought the Big Story from the show
was. He replied:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Web services. Not the kind where you deliver
Microsoft Word on a thin client. I'm talking about where devices
are interconnected with each other and enterprise class services
collect data, put information into devices, exchange information
and do other neat stuff. It's exciting. The Net gives us a great
angle on embedded&mdash;lots of XML and Java. All this stuff bubbling
up. At next year's show I expect to see forty products.</p></blockquote></div><p>I asked him about WiFi. He said, &ldquo;Next year you'll see it all
over the show. Hey, you go into a restaurant and there's lighting.
Why not the same for the Net? It's inevitable.&rdquo;</p><p>But what spectrum of light will we see? Will it be the whole
rainbow? Or just the colors Disney wants us to see?</p><p>And if we are asked by our employers and our government to
replace the people's Net with a corporate digital rights management
system, will we go about it as heads-down technologists? Or will we
refuse to build it?</p><p>Directly over where I was sitting was the
<a href="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~rmr/docs/48.01-king.html" target="_self">Martin
Luther King Memorial</a> in Yerba Buena Gardens. Behind the
waterfall, quotes by the good doctor are inscripted on glass. One
of them seems especially appropriate:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I am convinced that if we are to get on the right
side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical
revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a
thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines
and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered
more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme
materialism, and militarism are incapable of being
conquered.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>
