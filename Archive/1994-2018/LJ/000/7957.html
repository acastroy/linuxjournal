My article in the March 2005 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, 
<a href="../131/7796.html" target="_self">"Introducing
Ardour"</a>, left out some details regarding the
production of "Talkin' 'Bout The Weather". That's the song I composed as
an example for my article. These notes are intended to
fill out that article, so please refer to it if you don't understand what
I'm talking about here.
</p><p>
In addition to the equipment listed in the article, I used a Shure SM58
microphone for recording my vocal and harmonical parts. The strummed
guitar was a cheap Alvarez electroacoustic. I didn't care for its sound
when recorded directly--that is, plugged into the mixer--so I recorded it
instead with a Yamaha MZ160s mic. The Tascam TM-D1000 mixer was a
godsend. Thanks to its digital I/O, I recorded all acoustic parts from the mixer
into the digital ports of the Delta-66 audio interface. The final stereo
mix was routed to the Yamaha DMP11 digital mixer and out through a QCS
power amplifier to a pair of good near-field studio monitor speakers. As
expected, the recorded sound was clean and clear.
</p><p>
I wrote the simple bass and drum parts in Voyetra's Sequencer Plus Gold
(Seq+), a MIDI software sequencer dating from the late 1980s. Its written
for MS-DOS and without graphics other than the extended ASCII character
set. So why would I want to use such software in my otherwise modern Linux
audio arsenal? Well, I've used Seq+ for most of my MIDI sequencing for
almost 20 years, so I know the program well and can work with it
rapidly. Of course, I'm not running it under MS-DOS anymore, I'm running
it under DOSemu, a DOS environment emulator for Linux. Thanks to the care
and talents of the DOSemu developers, the emulator supports the basic
SoundBlaster audio services, including MIDI I/O, and runs well with the 
emulator. Seq+ was a highly successful commercial product into the middle 
1990s, but eventually production and support were discontinued. Recently
Voyetra decided to give away Seq+ as freeware, not software libre.
Actually, the company is giving away almost all of their MS-DOS MIDI software, without support, 
but even the proprietary MIDI interface drivers are now giveaways.
</p><p>
As I wrote in my article, I wrote some of the songs tracks originally
as MIDI tracks and later converted them to WAV format audio files. Here's
the magic formula I used with TiMidity:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
timidity -Ow filename.mid -o new-filename.wav
</pre><p>
Actually I used <tt  >-OwM</tt> to create mono tracks for everything except the
drums, for no other reason than I thought the drums would sound
better in stereo. I did things this way because I could quickly reconfigure TiMidity for
different sets of soundfonts, giving me more flexibility with my sound
combinations. Here are the contents of my ~/timidity.cfg file:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
soundfont /home/dlphilp/soundfonts/FluidR3_20GM.sf2
# soundfont /home/dlphilp/soundfonts/PC51f.sf2
# soundfont /home/dlphilp/soundfonts/8mbgmsfx.sf2
# soundfont /home/dlphilp/soundfonts/GS_Roland_Sound_Set_16_bit_Bank.sf2
</pre><p>
Thus, I could select from four different realizations of the same MIDI
file, making it an easy matter to re-orchestrate my recording. Each MIDI
file included the same tempo track, guaranteeing accurately coordinated
playback. However, to offset the rigidity of untreated MIDI playback, I
often write an asymmetrical tempo track with a series of looping values,
in 16th notes or smaller, moving back and forth between t+2 and t-2 to
create an underlying gentle instability in the feel of the tempo.
</p><p>
I employed the Snd soundfile editor for a variety of utility tasks, such
as fades, normalization and patching together fixes for poorly recorded
segments. For example, the rhythm guitar part was recorded badly, but
instead of replaying the part, I removed the affected regions--Ardour has
excellent region definition tools--and used Snd to replace seamlessly 
the bad parts with sections copied from elsewhere in the track. Again, 
Ardour made it simple to re-insert the corrected region. As I learned
more about Ardour, I discovered that I didn't need to rely upon Snd for my
utility edits. However, my version of the editor is customized heavily 
for my own use, and you already may have noticed I have quite a
retro streak when it comes to software I know and love.
</p><p>
The LADSPA plugins were another blessing. I used Steve Harris's plate
reverb for the vocal and harmonica parts. The MIDI guitar patch was
treated by Tom Szilagyi's TAP Equalizer, and the entire mix was processed
by the SC4 compressor, once again from Steve Harris. Plugins are saved
in their current state when an Ardour session is saved, and I also could 
save my parameter settings as presets for use in other sessions.
</p><p>
By the way, the vocal was a first take. I'd practiced the song for quite a
while before recording it. However, the harmonica part took some practice:
I hadn't really played blues harp for many years, so I was conservative
about its part in the sound. Fortunately, my initial efforts weren't so
bad, so I practiced over the recorded tracks for a while and came
up with the part heard in the released mix.
</p><p>
Mixing and balancing only seven tracks may seem to be a straightforward task,
but with Ardour's flexibility it easily was the lengthiest part of
the process. Auditioning the various combinations of tracks took time,
as did testing and retesting them with the LADSPA plugins. Fortunately, 
I was having a lot of fun, and it was a pleasure to hear and consider the
possible arrangements. Ardour makes it easy to mute and solo tracks,
individually or in user-defined groups. I balanced my bass and drum
parts first and then added the other tracks one by one, auditioning until
I was satisfied with the overall mix.
</p><p>
Incidentally, I wrote the melody and most of the lyrics more than a year
ago. The dominant seventh riff was something ultimately borrowed from
years of playing blues guitar. I debated whether I should add a vocal
bridge, but I couldn't come up with anything that satisfied me. Finally, 
the pressure of writing the Ardour article forced me to come up with
the harmonica break, a happy circumstance.

If I was doing this over, I'd probably use Ardour's automation a lot more, and
I'd check out some other LADSPA plugins. The drum parts can use some 
attention, and I probably could loosen up that dom7 riff a bit. A harmony
vocal might be nice, and at least one listener thought it would be a good
idea to bring in the harp earlier in the song. Well, my tracks all are 
in my Ardour session, and someday I'll try these ideas and suggestions,
but right now I've got a new song that's bursting to be recorded
into Ardour. Gotta run, the session can't start without me.
