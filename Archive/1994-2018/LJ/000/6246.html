    The list of dead web radio signals now includes the
    Linux-powered KPIG and too many other victims to count. Meanwhile,
    Hollywood's anti-Net campaign is winning the fight for hearts and minds
    of lawmakers and regulators. What's our response?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2896580.0x298e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>On July 17, I asked
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6218" target="_self">&ldquo;Why Are
So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air?&rdquo;</a> It was
only one week after the
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcasting_rates_final.html" target="_self">Final
Determination</a> by the Librarian of Congress had
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcast_regs.html" target="_self">become
law</a>--a law that was clearly a death sentence for internet
radio in the United States. At the time, few stations had quit
broadcasting, and there was little sign that any had plans to cease
operations.
</p><p>That changed the next day when
<a href="http://www.kpig.com" target="_self">KPIG</a> pulled its live
signals off the Web. KPIG was the first commercial radio station to
broadcast on the Web. After more than seven years on the air, it
had become one of the most popular webcasts in the world (and one
that was almost entirely Linux-based). Suddenly it was gone. From
there the news got worse. All over the country, webcasts were
dropping like bad packets.
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100243/2002/07/26.html" target="_self">The
casualty list</a> went bubonic, becoming too long and growing
too fast to count.</p><p>But Bill Goldsmith wasn't ready to throw in the towel&mdash;at
least not yet. Bill is the hacker-in-chief at KPIG and the
proprietor of his own popular internet station,
<a href="http://www.radioparadise.com" target="_self">Radio Paradise</a>.
He is also the only webcaster whose extensive automated
record-keeping system (based entirely on free and open-source
software) approaches the
<a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/webcasting.html" target="_self">level
of detail</a> required of webcasters under the new copyright
law. Since Bill is also a veteran broadcaster with a highly
successful on-air station (KPIG makes money and kicks butt in the
ratings), he's in a better position than anybody else on earth to
advocate the webcasters' case both to lawmakers and copyright
holders.</p><p>In news stories about the internet radio kill-off, Bill had
been publicly remarking about negotiations with &ldquo;copyright
holders&rdquo;, without giving any more details. When I contacted him
early last week, he said he was optimistic about those negotiations
and that we should know something more on Thursday. I
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q3/000026.html" target="_self">wrote
a story without an ending</a> on Wednesday, in my SuitWatch
newsletter. And the next day, right on schedule, the good news came
in: Representatives <a href="http://www.house.gov/boucher" target="_self">Rick
Boucher (D-VA)</a>,
<a href="http://www.house.gov/nethercutt" target="_self">George Nethercutt
(R-WA)</a> and <a href="http://www.house.gov/inslee" target="_self">Jay
Inslee (D-WA)</a> had just introduced the
<a href="http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/072602/index.asp" target="_self">Internet
Radio Fairness Act (IRFA)</a>. The bill, H.R. 5285, would
&ldquo;amend title 17, United States Code, with respect to royalty fees
for webcasting, and for other purposes.&rdquo; Those fees were determined
by
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">CARP
(Copyright Arbitration and Royalty Panel)</a> in compliance
with the
<a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~willr/cb/sos/dmcapage.shtml" target="_self">Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>. Here's what the three men
said in a
<a href="http://www.house.gov/inslee/tech_internetradio.htm" target="_self">joint
press release</a> published on Inslee's site:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Inslee: &ldquo;Congress should support creative and
innovative uses for new technology, not drive small web radio
broadcasters out of business with huge fees. We need to refine the
current law on digital technology quickly, before more small web
radio broadcasters are forced out of business. Changing the
standard for setting royalty rates is crucial to the survival of
this innovative sector. We seek a balance between just compensation
and internet development. This process must be fair but not free.&rdquo;
</p><p>Nethercutt: &ldquo;No one wins under the current CARP
standard&mdash;webcasters will close shop, consumers lose access to a
wide selection of programming, and copyright holders collect
nothing. Our legislation protects small businesses from the onerous
CARP ruling, ensuring the continuation of webcasting and,
incidentally, creating a long-term revenue stream for copyright
holders.&rdquo;</p><p>Boucher: &ldquo;Unfortunately, both the CARP and the Librarian of
Congress were working under a flawed law that has produced a
royalty rate that harms not only the hundreds of webcasters that
have already shut down operations, but also internet users seeking
innovative music programming and artists seeking alternative
avenues through which to promote their music.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Later I learned from Bill Goldsmith that the IRFA
introduction was purely coincidental. He had nothing to do with it.
His negotiations were with the victors in the CARP battle: the
RIAA. I asked him what he thought about IRFA, about the
negotiations with the RIAA and whether he would consider taking
Radio Paradise offshore if talks failed. Here is his reply:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The most important thing that the Boucher bill
would accomplish is an important reform of the CARP process itself:
facilitating participation by small businesses and losing the
&ldquo;willing buyer-willing seller&rdquo; model. That's what led the previous
CARP to settle on the wildly atypical Yahoo-RIAA agreement as a
model for the compulsory license.
</p><p>It probably would not protect KPIG as presently worded,
because KPIG is owned by a corporation with revenues in excess of
$6 million per year.</p><p>Personally, I doubt that the bill will pass, and it certainly
won't pass in time to solve the present crisis. Radio Paradise is
presently involved in negotiations (along with several other
independent webcasters) with the RIAA to try to strike a
compromise. It looks like that may happen well before any
legislative remedy could be applied.</p><p>As for RP going offshore, the CARP rates are only a
relatively small factor influencing our decision there. Though the
idea of being able to put this entire issue behind me is very
attractive.</p></blockquote></div><p>Bill's betting line on IRFA is substantiated by the fact that
two of IRFA's three congressional authors say nothing about the
bill on their web sites (Inslee is the only one who appears
interested). <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov" target="_self">THOMAS</a>, a
web site built to record every piece of legislation in the
congressional mill, also appears to know nothing about H.R.
5285.</p><p>Is it real? One has to wonder. We've
<a href="../000/6097.html" target="_self">fallen</a> for
<a href="http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/052102/index.asp" target="_self">false
hopes</a> before. What turned them false was the tide of
pro-Hollywood thinking that began flowing through Congress long
before it carried the DMCA into copyright law in 1998. As Larry
Lessig said in his
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/15/keynotes.html" target="_self">keynote</a>
at OSCon last week, we&mdash;the Free Software, Open Source and
pro-Internet communities&mdash;are losing the argument. The Internet,
which grew almost entirely outside the regulatory environment, is
being pulled inside, not only in the US but all over the world. In
May 2001 the
<a href="http://silvaneves.org/eucd/eucd-fs.en.html" target="_self">European
Union Copyright Directive (EUCD)</a> followed the US lead in
extending copyright terms and fair-use restrictions. We like to say
the Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it, but
in what decade? Tell that to the guys
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100243/2002/07/26.html" target="_self">on
this list here</a>. Many (probably most) of them ran on
Linux.</p><p>This pro-Hollywood bias in Congress runs so deep that even
legislators who think they're being fair still operate like sock
puppets for Jack Valenti. Take the case of Senator Harry Reed of
Nevada. In response to a helpful suggestion from Tom Poe, who runs
<a href="http://www.studioforrecording.org" target="_self">Open
Studios</a>, a community-based, open-source, free recording
studio in Reno, the Senator sent a reply in Jack Valenti's own
handwriting (the highlights are mine):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Dear Mr. Poe:
</p><p>Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about
the intellectual property rights and the public domain. I
appreciate hearing from you.</p><p>I understand your concerns about ensuring that. This issue is
very controversial because Congress must
<span   class="bold"><b>protect</b></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>intellectual property rights</b></span> while
still <span   class="bold"><b>allowing</b></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>ordinary Internet users</b></span> to have
<span   class="bold"><b>access</b></span> to
<span   class="bold"><b>public domain content</b></span>. I
appreciate hearing your suggestion for a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; system. I am
carefully reviewing a number of proposals to address this issue,
and as I do so, I will keep your views in mind.</p><p>Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts
with me. For more information about my work for Nevada, my role in
the United States Senate Leadership or to subscribe to regular
e-mail updates on the issues that interest you, please visit my web
site at http://reid.senate.gov. I look forward to hearing from you
in the near future.</p><p>My best wishes to you.Sincerely,HARRY REIDUnited States
Senator</p></blockquote></div><p>Look at the caste system implied by the Senator's
wording:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What matters most are intellectual property
rights.</p></li><li><p>The Internet's only important content is protected
property.</p></li><li><p>That property must be excluded from the public
domain.</p></li><li><p>The public domain is something that exists only for
&ldquo;ordinary internet users&rdquo; who only should have &ldquo;access&rdquo; to
it.</p></li></ul></div><p>Well, what about our friends in the big technology companies?
Don't they have some influence in Congress too? The sad answer is
that they're conflicted at best. At worst, they're on Hollywood's
side. This became clear last week at OSCon, where Bruce Perens
planned to demonstrate the DeCSS software that lets Linux users
play DVDs but was developed outside the auspices of the consumer
electronics cartel. His
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/3111" target="_self">Friday
session</a> was billed this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Digital Rights Management - How Will It Affect Linux and Free Software?</b></span></p><p>Bruce Perens</p><p>Track: Emerging Topics</p><p>Date: Friday, July 26</p><p>Time: 2:30pm - 3:15pm</p><p>Location: Grande</p><p>Ballroom B</p><p>Bruce Perens demonstrates digital rights management systems
and their circumventions, and covers how the underlying technology
works. How will we be able to use DRM-protected media? What
political and technical problems does it present for Linux and Free
Software?</p></blockquote></div><p>We got the
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/07/26/020726hndmcawimp.xml" target="_self">answer</a>
to the title question when Martin Fink, Bruce's boss at
Hewlett-Packard, stopped the proceedings in their tracks. &ldquo;I have a
thing about my employees going to jail&rdquo;, Fink told the crowd before
Bruce's talk, &ldquo;and I don't want Bruce to go to jail. Hopefully
he'll thank me for that one day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of you came here to see me taken away in chains&rdquo;, Bruce
told the session. &ldquo;But that isn't going to happen.&rdquo; No, only
metaphorically. &ldquo;Obviously, I could still do it...but that would
damage HP's Linux program, which would probably be a bad
idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Bruce spoke, Fink explained HP's position on the DMCA.
On the one hand, he said, &ldquo;We do understand that there are aspects
of the DMCA that are not favorable to the Open Source community.&rdquo;
On the other hand (the one with the chains), he said &ldquo;the content
producers have a right to get paid for their content.&rdquo;</p><p>As if Linux users don't buy DVDs.</p><p>HP's stripes became clearer yesterday, when Declan McCullagh
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html" target="_self">reported</a>
that HP invoked the DMCA in its threat to sue researchers who
publicized a bug in HP's Tru64 UNIX operating system. In response,
Bruce posted this on his <a href="http://www.perens.com" target="_self">web
site</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hot Topic:</b></span>9:46
P.M. PST, Tuesday July 30:Everyone's after me about the way HP is
alleged to have used DMCA to intimidate someone who reported a
security flaw in the Tru64 OS. If it's true, obviously I will have
some criticism for HP management. When I went to work there, I
negotiated for the right to criticize HP publicly, when necessary.
This might be one of those times. Give me a little time to
investigate.</p></blockquote></div><p>Credit where due: it takes a certain kind of bravery to labor
in the belly of the beast. That goes for congressmen as well as
hackers like Bruce. But like geeks in the corporations that employ
them, the congressional good guys are in the minority, and they are
not matching their opponents move-for-move. On July 19,
<a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000155.html#000155" target="_self">Sen.
Ernest Hollings sent a letter</a> to FCC Chairman Michael
Powell urging the adoption of a &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; that would resist
copying of digital content intended for broadcast and aid in the
prosecution of copying violators.
(<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/HDTV/20020611_eff_bpdg_pr.html" target="_self">Here's
the EFF's take on the issue</a>.) On the same day,
<a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000156.html#000156" target="_self">Senators
Tauzin and Dingel sent a joint letter of their own</a> making
the same request. And on July 25,
<a href="http://www.house.gov/berman" target="_self">Rep. Howard Berman</a>
(D-CA), the representative from the part of Los Angeles where
Disney (the top Berman
<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.asp?CID=N00008094&amp;cycle=2002" target="_self">contributor</a>)
makes its home,
<a href="http://www.house.gov/berman/pr062502.htm" target="_self">previewed
legislation</a> intended to sanction &ldquo;electronic
countermeasures&rdquo;--what CNET calls
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-939333.html?tag=fd_top" target="_self">&ldquo;high
tech attacks&rdquo;</a>--against peer-to-peer trafficking in
copyrighted &ldquo;content&rdquo;.</p><p>In the <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span>, columnist
Dan Gillmor wrote this in
<a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/3751660.htm" target="_self">&ldquo;Hacking,
hijacking our rights&rdquo;</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you or I asked Congress for permission to

Hill. Then we'd be investigated by the FBI and every other agency
concerned with criminal violations of privacy and security.
</p><p>Then again, you and I aren't part of the movie and music
business. We aren't as powerful as an industry that knows no bounds
in its paranoia and greed, a cartel that boasts enough money and
public-relations talent to turn Congress into a marionette.</p></blockquote></div><p>When I asked a Hollywood-connected friend of mine how the
Berman bill was going down with the geeks in the industry, I got
back this e-mail:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The entertainment geeks think &ldquo;Berman is a
complete money-grubbing, technically illiterate idiot.&rdquo; (A direct
quote from an undisclosed source.) Other reliable inside sources
said the reason Berman sponsored the bill was because he &ldquo;wanted
the money&rdquo; (not needed it) and was running unopposed. He thought
the bill would endear him to the big money-donating, studio types
in the neighborhood. However, he was clueless about how it would
divide the voters in the district. Remember the San Fernando Valley
has as many technical people as creative types. Talk about the
Hatfields and the McCoy's!
</p><p>The best comment came from a close friend of mine who said,
&ldquo;The talent-types in entertainment community are completely stupid
about the effects of all these laws. Talent is normally pretty
brainless about how things <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> work.
However, because they are the pretty faces who can get the camera
time on-air, they get heard before we techies get the time of day.
It will be a pretty damn big wake-up call if these laws go
through&mdash;and they can't get their cheap indie-productions done on a
shoestring for an f'in tax big write-off during their next summer
hiatus!&rdquo;</p><p>Many are saying if the law goes through&mdash;they are leaving the
business.</p></blockquote></div><p>Publicly, we are hearing almost nothing from our allies in
Hollywood. One welcome exception is
<a href="http://www.kenlayne.com" target="_self">Ken Layne</a>, who wrote

of intellectual property that might show up in a movie, a musical
recording or some other &ldquo;content&rdquo; that will flow from a few huge
producers to millions of &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; through government-regulated
