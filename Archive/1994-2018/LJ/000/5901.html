    In a bizarre move that requires a bazaar
    response, the U.S. Copyright Office plans to price Webcasters off the
    Net and replace the creative commons with a content pumping system

Paradise, where <a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">Bill Goldsmith has been
making the most</a> of open-source methods and software to give
this young industry what it needs to grow and even make a little
money along the way. When you tune into his stations (and to many
of the others listed above), you're literally <span   class="emphasis"><em>listening
to Linux</em></span>.</p><p>What we're seeing with Internet Radio, even more than we saw
with Napster, is the music market's workaround of a grotesquely
obsolete regulatory environment where big-time broadcasting has
grown safely protected from accountability to its own users. Today
the AM and FM bands are populated almost entirely by a strange
breed of immense mutant advertising-fed cattle that seem to
reproduce only by cloning. Drive through four cities hitting your
radio's SCAN button, and you'll find at least four different
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=good+times+great+oldies" target="_self">Good
Times, Great Oldies&rdquo; stations</a> playing the same playlist of
200 songs. And that's just the tip of the shitberg.</p><p>Simply put, Internet Radio is what happens when Demand gets
the power to Supply. It's nothing more complicated than The Market
at work.</p><p>But the regulators and their bizarre beneficiaries have no
idea what a real market is, and they are lined up with bulldozers,
ready to replace nature's own music marketplace with a new
Net-enhanced version of the plumbing system we call The Media. They
started with the
<a href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html" target="_self">DMCA</a>,
and their latest bulldozer is something called CARP, the Copyright
Arbitration and Royalty Panel. After meeting in secret for the last
several months, CARP issued a
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">report</a>
on February 20 &ldquo;recommending rates and terms for the statutory
license for eligible nonsubscription services to perform sound
recordings publicly by means of digital audio transmissions
(&rdquo;webcasting&ldquo;) under 17 U.S.C. &sect;114...&rdquo; etc.</p><p>Specifically, CARP wants to charge very
steeply&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>punitively</em></span>&mdash;for broadcasting music on
the Net. <a href="http://www.kpig.com/?content=web_radio" target="_self">KPIG
lays out the issues</a> as kindly as they can:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Independent webcasters such as KPIG are facing a
grave threat to our existence. It may be an evil conspiracy on the
part of the big record companies and corporate webcasters, or -
more likely - it's just a dumb mistake. In either case, KPIG could
soon be liable for huge music usage fees ($5,000 - $10,000 per
month) that would make it impossible for us to stay online.</p></blockquote></div><p>The effect will be to outlaw webcasting, something the big
broadcasters will never miss because it's a pain in their butts
anyway.</p><p>The DMCA anchors a strategic vector for these people, and
it's not hard to see where it's pointing. How long before the
Library of Congress (which is behind CARP, by the way), in cahoots
with some new industry-led enforcement body, starts crawling the
Web looking for matches between quoted and copyrighted text and
busting individuals for violations? How long before free speech
starts costing you? (And not just
<a href="http://www.freesklyarov.org" target="_self">Dmitry</a>.)</p><p>Webcasting is just the first species marked for destruction.
Whether this is an evil plot, a dumb bureaucracy at work or both,
the effects are the same: the destruction of the Net as a commons
and its replacement with a plumbing system for the distribution of
&ldquo;content&rdquo; (a word hardly used in a shipping context before Big
Media got all drooly over The Promise of The Net).</p><p>So what can we do, beyond what the
<a href="http://www.eff.org" target="_self">EFF</a> and other
<a href="http://208.3.135.80" target="_self">friends</a> are already
<a href="http://www.povradio.com/riaa_carp_facts.htm#proposal" target="_self">up</a>
to?</p><p>In my most recent
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2002q1/000016.html" target="_self">SuitWatch
newsletter</a>, I called for two courses of action:</p><p>One is to do everything we can to draw a distinction between
the place-based concepts on which the Net and the Web were based
(and which drive expressions like &ldquo;address&rdquo;, &ldquo;site&rdquo;, &ldquo;home&rdquo; and
&ldquo;location&rdquo;) and the plumbing-based concepts by which the both
regulators and Big Media want to redefine the Net (and which drive
expressions like &ldquo;content&rdquo;, &ldquo;deliver&rdquo;, &ldquo;move&rdquo; and &ldquo;distribute&rdquo;). I
think
<a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-03-01/screens_feature6.html" target="_self">Larry
Lessig</a> and the
<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_self">Creative
Commons</a> folk (who will have a
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1126" target="_self">high
profile</a> at the upcoming
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon2002" target="_self">O'Reilly
Emerging Technology Conference</a>) are doing a good job at
framing that one up. But we need to build on the Commons concept;
just being conscious about language will help. Look at it this
way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>We</em></span> have the advantage if we
talk about the Net as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>place</em></span>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>They</em></span> have the advantage if we
talk about the Net as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>plumbing system</em></span> for
shipping content.</p></li></ul></div><p>(And make no mistake, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a
death-match between the two, one fought in our own minds as well as
out in the social environment we call The Marketplace.)</p><p>The other is to march on Washington*. I know that's very 60s
and retro, but sometimes you just have to get physical. You have to
deliver the missing clues, in person, to elected representatives
and the regulators they employ. What better place to do that than
on the nation's home commons? For a little motivation on that one,
let's revisit the
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti" target="_self">First
Amendment</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or
the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
government for a redress of grievances.</p></blockquote></div><p>Congress made <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> that kind of law
with DMCA, and it needs to repealed.</p><p>Let's show these guys there's nothing bizarre about democracy
at work but, instead, something very bazaar. It's hard to imagine a
more peaceable assembly than one that's nothing more than a real
market doing its real job.</p><p>*Or we could take a train, webcasting live music along the
way, stopping to perform and have fun at venues along the way.
Whatever it takes.</p></div></div>
