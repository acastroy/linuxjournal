prognostications. Will next year be better or worse? Will stocks
stay in the tank? Will the real estate bubble burst? Will consumer
confidence rise?</p><p>When it came to Linux, of course, there was the perennial
LOTD&mdash;Linux on the Desktop&mdash;question, for which the answer is
the equally perennial &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;.</p><p>Me, I'm mostly wondering what happens when business finishes
waking up to the abundance of highly useful free stuff in the
world. There are signs it's happening.</p><p>For example,
<a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/010103/16.html" target="_self">here's
Christopher Koch, in CIO Magazine</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A for-profit software company cannot compete with the
economics of open source&mdash;free is as cheap as it gets. Nor, it
turns out, can it compete with open source's quality testing
process. Though the pace of open-source development can be languid
and tends to create products less functionally rich than their
proprietary counterparts, the stuff gets tested so often and so
brutally by so many different people that most open-source programs
are judged to be more stable and reliable. In a commodity market,
low cost and reliability count more than bells and whistles.</p></blockquote></div><p>That's where we connect the dots between Linux' domination of
the server business (a milestone the Butler Group expects to pass,
languidly, in 2009) and the same eventuality with desktops.</p><p>PCs can't be commodities if they're not running commodity
OSes. Nearly all of them aren't, and that's THE problem with the PC
marketplace right now. Commodity customers aren't seeing commodity
alternatives to Windows. Not in stores, anyway. Not yet.</p><p>But with the price of PC hardware melting toward nothing, the
(growing!) cost of Windows is becoming an increasingly exposed and
unsustainable irony. At some point low cost and reliability will
win the market. That's when LOTD breaks through the dam.</p><p>That dam consists almost entirely of the big international PC
hardware companies' collective unwillingness to market Linux
desktops and laptops in a serious way.</p><p>But, again, there are signs.</p><p>The Bigs won't risk making their first move right under
Microsoft's nose here in the U.S. Instead they'll answer demand in
those parts of the world where technology is no less important, but
there's far less money to go around.</p><p>Like
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6450" target="_self">India,</a>
for example.</p><p>On Wednesday, India's
<a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=24958" target="_self">Financial
Express reported</a> that Hewlett-Packard is coming out with a
Compaq Presario home PC&mdash;with monitor, speakers and the rest of
the usual works&mdash;for 30,990 rupees, or about $645. It features a
1.5 GHz AMD Athlon cpu, and Red Hat Linux. The Intel-based Windows
XP alternative is 40,000 rupees, or about $833. Local &ldquo;assemblers&rdquo;
are putting together other bundles for as little as 24,000 rupees,
or about $500.
&lt;http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=24958&gt;</p><p>This comes at a time when Hewlett-Packard is running thick
multi-page ads in magazines describing how HP and Linux have done
wonders for the likes of
<a href="../000/6103.html" target="_self">Dreamworks</a> and Amazon on the
server side&mdash;while also running ads for the Compaq Tablet PC that
chant &ldquo;HP recommends Microsoft Windows XP Professional for Mobile
Computing&rdquo; on every page. Co-op advertising money will buy
impressions, but it won't make bells and whistles outsell low cost
and reliability&mdash;especially for customers that desperately crave
the latter. At some point those sales go over a line, and the dam
bursts.</p><p>So... When will it happen here in the U.S.? Is 2003 the year
we see big-name hardware companies selling Linux as aggressively as
they sell Windows&mdash;by which I mean Linux PCs show up in stores
and on the front pages of Web sites?</p><p>Paul Saffo famously said we overestimate in the short term
and underestimate in the long. But I'm going to go out on a limb
and say the long term is mostly behind us. (How many years have we
been waiting for LOTD to take off?) Somebody is going to break the
ice this year. My own instinct says it'll be IBM, mostly because
there must be serious demand for LOTD (as well as improvised
solutions with it) inside the company. You can't have that many
engineers walking around with Linuxified ThinkPads and not get
around to selling them at some point.</p><p>I'm betting Dell will be next. Then Gateway. Then HP. Yes,
I'm basing this on admittedly scant evidence, but you can help in
that department. Feel free to feed me some real facts if you have
them. (I'm <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>)
</p><p>As for other predictions, here are a few that come quickly to
mind:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Members of Unbreakable Linux will continue not
using that expression to describe what they do with the OS.</p></li><li><p>Members of United Linux will be united in not using
the adjectival first name when casually describing their Linux
offerings.</p></li><li><p>Approximately 100% of positive publicity statistics
about Microsoft advantages over Linux will be the result of
research bought by Microsoft.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6476" target="_self">Red
Hat</a> will jump to the front of the LOTD bandwagon, once it
starts rolling.</p></li><li><p>Embedded Linux will be driven in a huge way by Sony
and Matshushita, which recently announced the intent to co-develop
a standard form of embedded Linux for consumer electronics (think
of it as an XBox payback)</p></li></ul></div><p>In other words, this is the year to bet on the tortoise that
looks like a penguin.</p><p>But enough of my predictions. What about yours? Send them
along. If they make good sense, I'll share them with the rest of us
here.</p></div></div>
