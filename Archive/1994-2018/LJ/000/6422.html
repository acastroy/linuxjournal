(Thursday) brought us to
<a href="http://www.caribline.com/islands/jm/ormap.shtml" target="_self">Ocho
Rios</a>, a town on the north coast of Jamaica. Here we met
early in the morning with the
<a href="http://www.jsdnp.org.jm/jalug/index.html" target="_self">Jamaica Linux
Users Group (JaLUG)</a>, where Linus and other speakers from
the cruise answered questions in a wide-ranging Q&amp;A. The
<a href="http://www.focuspublicationsint.com/focusonjamaica/ochorios.htm" target="_self">setting</a>
was The Ruins Pub &amp; Internet Cafe, which sits beside a perfect
waterfall and a patio shaded by palms and banyan trees.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6422f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
A high point in the JaLUG meeting calendar.
</p></div></div><p>Later, most cruisers found their way to
<a href="http://travelwithkids.about.com/library/jamaica/bldunnsriver.htm" target="_self">Dunn's
River Falls</a>. Here a cool mountain river cascades over
limestone boulders for hundreds of yards on its way to the sea.
Pretty as it is to watch, Dunn's is basically an interactive river.
The main idea is to climb the falls upstream from the bottom to the
top. It's a bit scary, but most of us had no trouble with it,
thanks to experienced guides and pink rubber booties the park rents
to visitors who don't trust their own bare feet or sandals.</p><p>Guides aren't required for the trek, but they are highly
recommended. When we saw the size of our guide's crowd meeting down
at the beach, we accepted an offer by a rogue guide to take our
small group up ahead of the huge one. About a hundred feet up the
first course of waterfalls, the official guide got into a big
argument with our unofficial one, ultimately coming to a
settlement: our group should take on at least one climber from the
big crowd. We chose Cathy Raymond (for those who don't know, Cathy
is the wife of ESR).</p><p>At this point our group included Greg Haerr, myself, my wife,
our six-year-old son, Cathy and the guide. We arrived at the top a
good twenty minutes ahead of the crowd. At the exit point there's a
pool fed by a wide and smooth waterfall about six feet high.
Standing in that falling current is a profoundly refreshing
experience, even if you don't get sweated up by the long
climb.</p><p>On the way back, our taxi driver, Donald, gave us a terrific
tour of the town and countryside. Along the way it was fun to
discover that Donald knew
<a href="http://reggaeclub.cyberkern.com/shaka" target="_self">Jah
Shaka</a>, the reggae music figure and
<a href="http://jahshakafx.sourceforge.net" target="_self">open-source effects
developer.</a> I had hoped Jah Shaka would be able to join us
that morning at the JaLUG meeting. It turned out Donald knew what
Jah Shaka had told me earlier in an e-mail: that he'd be busy at a
recording session that day&mdash;small island.</p><p>That evening's talk was a wide-ranging Q&amp;A with all the
speakers on stage. It turned out to be an egalitarian affair, more
like a conversational circle, with an even balance of power between
audience and stage.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Day Six</b></span> (Friday) was a full
day at sea, as the ship threaded the straits between the east end
of Cuba and the West end of Haiti. That morning Eric Raymond talked
about &ldquo;Twenty Years Among the Hackers&rdquo;, while Guido van Rossum
covered &ldquo;Application Development with Python&rdquo;. Steven Oualline's
&ldquo;Bullet Proofing, Paranoia, and Mucking Out&rdquo; followed, along with
ESR's &ldquo;The Great Brain Race&rdquo;.</p><p>At lunch I interviewed Lincoln Durey of
<a href="http://www.emperorlinux.com" target="_self">Emperor Linux</a>. We
got off to a late start when we were upstaged by a natural
phenomenon. Outside the window we saw some kind of stirring out on
the calm waters about a mile away. Then we noticed a line
connecting sea to sky: a funnel cloud had dropped down from a
squall line behind the boat. When we went up on the stern deck, we
saw at least three (I counted four) funnels snaking down from the
clouds. At sea these are called water spouts; on land they're
tornadoes. Either way, watching them beat dodging hurricanes, which
is what cruises like this often do in the Caribbean this time of
year.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6422f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Locally heavy weather
</p></div></div><p>That afternoon's sessions were &ldquo;Code Inspections and Reviews&rdquo;
(Steve Oualline), &ldquo;Introduction to Zope&rdquo; (Guido van Rossum), &ldquo;GUIs
and Embedded Linux&rdquo; (Greg Haerr), &ldquo;Digital Forensics Using
Open-Source Tools&rdquo; (Brian Carrier) and &ldquo;Building Ad Hoc Serverless
Communities&rdquo; (Brandon Wiley). The evening session was a lively and
fun quiz show moderated by Steve Oualline: &ldquo;How Not to Program in
C++&rdquo;.</p><p>On <span   class="bold"><b>Day Seven</b></span> (Saturday), we
took tender boats to Half Moon Cay (formerly Little San Salvador),
which is uninhabited except when the big boats come visiting. The
long, protected C-shaped beach is lovely and remarkably uncrowded,
considering the large population ferried from the ship. Here we had
a whole day to scuba, snorkel, take out sailboat or kayaks, or just
drink and hang out.</p><p>The party master for the cruise, by the way, was Randall
Schwartz, who has been on <span   class="emphasis"><em>all thirteen</em></span> Geek
Cruises. I asked Randall if he felt like Bill Murray in the movie
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Groundhog Day</em></span>, waking up each morning ready to
repeat the same experiences, over and over again. He said no, each
cruise was different and new.</p><p>The next morning we were off the boat and back to our
ordinary lives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18da580.0x19d2f50"></a>The Take-Aways</h2></div></div><p>The most useful part of the trip for me was getting to hang
around Linus and see how his mind works. He's a very subtle and
funny guy, but also a deeply practical one. There is a lot of
idealism attached to Linux, but at its core the OS is the practical
product of a practical mind. And one that quietly savors the irony
of it all.</p><p>The
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2124552,00.html" target="_self">CNET/ZDNet
story on Linus' talk</a> covered the Q&amp;A's high points as
news items, which is fine; but the story didn't convey the friendly
and convivial nature of the affair. Linus doesn't give talks any
more, he told us, which is why he preferred the Q&amp;A
format.</p><p>He made it clear throughout the talk that he was speaking as
the kernel's chief hacker. &ldquo;I only do kernel stuff&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;I
did user level stuff about 10 years ago&mdash;only because without it
the kernel isn't usable. I don't know what happens outside the
kernel, and I don't much care. What happens inside the kernel I
care about.&rdquo;</p><p>This meant he considers his thoughts about the Itanium (he
doesn't like it) and OS X (he's still not a fan) irrelevant, no
matter how interesting (or even newsworthy) those thoughts may be.
His high-content points mostly concerned the 2.6 kernel:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Right now, we are very close to a feature
freeze&mdash;(at the) end of this month. So when I get home I'll have
about three days to say no to people. After that we're done. We're
close to 2.6, feature wise. It looks fairly stable too. It doesn't
look too bad. One of the big features that happened during 2.5 [was
that] the block device layer got completely rewritten in many
different ways. The queuing is different. Just the startup for a
block device driver is very different. You register disks
differently. You keep track of all the disk data, all the
partitions you have...</p></blockquote></div><p>He went on to say that most of the problems in development
through version 2.5 have involved coping with this fundamental
architectural change.</p><p>Also on the subject of kernel development, Linus said he
preferred Bitkeeper to CVS, even though he wasn't fond of
Bitkeeper's licensing. But even there he made a point repeated so
often on the trip that I came to believe it's his favorite phrase:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I don't care</em></span>.</p><p>We tend to assume that strong opinions involve strong
emotions, but Linus proves over and over that this doesn't need to
be the case. He has countless strong opinions about subjects that
don't move him emotionally. That's probably true with all of us.
But saying it out loud has proven to be extremely useful, because
it shunts to ground the emotional charges around countless
potentially unproductive and off-topic arguments. The result is a
movement as deeply practical as its product.</p><p>Here are a few of my notes from Linus' Q&amp;A. Most of them
are close to verbatim quotes (again, you can
<a href="http://205.122.23.229/peng/linusq-a.ogg" target="_self">listen to the
original</a>) :</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>I always thought WINE was important, but not
supremely important.</p></li><li><p>I'm a big believer in cheap, powerful and good
enough.</p></li><li><p>The big things that have happened in Linux have all
been open source.</p></li><li><p>It's very important that all infrastructure is open
source.</p></li><li><p>Oracle is not the thing that makes Linux
popular.</p></li><li><p>It's about showing them that we can do
better.</p></li><li><p>To me all the politics is just amusement value. I
don't care.</p></li><li><p>I have never in more than six years been able to
talk about what customers are doing. I want to be in development
projects. That's it.</p></li><li><p>My problem has always been trying to throw the
uninteresting stuff to other people and make them feel it's
interesting. It's been working real well.</p></li><li><p>There's always stuff to do. There is always to some
degree <span   class="emphasis"><em>too much</em></span> stuff to do.</p></li><li><p>I think I'm a klutz, and I'll bet a hundred dollars
you think you're one too. Being a klutz is okay. Being a klutz who
thinks he's competent is really irritating.</p></li><li><p>I don't put too much store in design. A lot of the
things I dislike are overdesigned.</p></li><li><p>We have not been bug free by any stretch. (Linux'
success is) about a willingness to admit bugs and get them
fixed.</p></li><li><p>Linux is not secure by design.</p></li><li><p>My job is tastemaster. My job is to say no to some
things.</p></li></ul></div><p>Over dinner later in the week, Linus dropped a terrific one
liner: &ldquo;The customer may always be right, but not always bright.&rdquo;
That led me to think that open-source infrastructure developers
need to be bright, but not always right&mdash;just close enough.</p><p>Infrastructure is naturally practical stuff, and that's why
Linux is becoming as fundamental to the nature of computing as rock
is to architecture. It's not perfect and never will be. But it's
good enough, and it keeps getting better, by expressing and
embodying all the stuff Eric Raymond covered in his &ldquo;Zen of UNIX&rdquo;
talk, which you'll also find in
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/chapter1.html" target="_self">the
first chapter of his next book</a>. One nice quote from that
talk:</p><p>The history of computing is littered with the bones of
programming environments that were so powerful that nobody would
ever need to do anything else.</p><p>Several other related realizations also became clear in the
course of cruise.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux' presence in the world is steadily,
inexorably, commodifying operating systems</em></span>, and there is
nothing anybody, including Microsoft, Sun or anybody else can do to
stop it. One of the participants, Roland Smith of LSI Logic, told
me how Linux is becoming the company-wide platform for pretty much
everything, including high end engineering tools.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Hardware is now so commodified that
tolerance for relatively expensive software is bound to go away at
the low end of the market.</em></span> That market is huge. In most
large companies it includes hundreds or thousands of employees
dedicated to using one or two job-related applications. Beyond
e-mail and browsing, the need for productivity applications is
minimal. This means that spreadsheets, word processors, personal
information managers and presentation software are naturally going
to become generic and commodified.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Transparency is a virtue that make the
case for a lot of open-source code</em></span>, as well as its
development methods. ESR: &ldquo;Look at open-source digital forensics,
which we're starting to use in law enforcement. We have to prove
the underlying processes. Digital analysis wants to be like digital
sciences, which means the underlying processes and procedures have
to be knowable.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>New generic applications will become
platforms of their own</em></span>, thin layers of hard code on
which countless scripts and scripted applications can run. ESR
again: &ldquo;We're seeing a transition from high level compiled
languages to scripting languages. In time C won't be used for
anything but OSes and critical applications. Scripting languages
will do high level memory and resource management.&rdquo; For some
perspective on this, take a look at what Mitch Kapor is doing with
the
<a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/our_product_desc.htm" target="_self">first
application</a> developed by his new
<a href="http://www.osafoundation.org" target="_self">Open Source Applications
Foundation</a> (which was announced during the cruise). Code
named Chandler, it's a personal information manager that puts all
kinds of scripting (mostly Python) and scriptable modules around a
core of C and C++ code. &ldquo;We've been enormously influenced by the
success of Linux and how that was done&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,75498,00.html" target="_self">Mitch
says</a>. Thus a development model validates itself to
ubiquity.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LOTD&mdash;Linux on the Desktop&mdash;will
inevitably become popular</em></span>. It might not happen rapidly,
but the success of Mozilla 1.x is a useful harbinger. People
scoffed and said Mozilla would never happen. But it did. There is a
vast market for generic desktops&mdash;basically the same market that
bought countless dumb 3270 and VT-X00 terminals twenty years ago.
Microsoft won't be cheap or open enough to serve that market. Apple
wants the high end professionals and upscale consumers. That leaves
Linux running OpenOffice, Chandler and other commodity
applications.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The big companies are finally getting fed
up with the high cost of doing business with Microsoft</em></span>.
Yes, there are the familiar crashes of big mission critical
applications. One cruiser, Kel Vanderlip, said, &ldquo;What's driving
Linux into corporations is the failure of Exchange&rdquo;. But the main
issue for Big IT today is Microsoft's damaged relationships with
customers. The decision by Microsoft to muscle up license fees this
past summer was a dumb move by a smart company. In the past,
Microsoft has generally tried to do what the market wants. In fact,
I believe the biggest uncredited cause of Microsoft's success is
its extreme sensitivity to what customers want. But no customer
wants a big price increase or newer, tougher licensing terms. By
demanding those prices, Microsoft proved to be less a marketing
company than an entrenched monopoly whose only revenue-growing
choice is to extract more money from its customers. Financially, it
looks good so far. This week Microsoft announced higher net
earnings based on those price increases. Those earnings, however,
came from customers who mostly felt they had little choice. From
what I've been hearing (and not just on the boat) many of those
customers are looking to move off Microsoft at the first
opportunity.</p></li></ol></div><p>Linux is waiting.</p><p><a href="../000/6419.html" target="_self">Part 1</a>
