refund debate that started in the late 1990s. A Google search turns
up dozens of pages belonging to people who have made attempts to
provide helpful information to those seeking a refund. Browsing
these pages reminds me of a recent trip I took to Salem,
Massachusetts, where I participated in a guided tour through the
burial grounds of the Witch Trials of 1692. Every link, another
tombstone telling a piece of the bigger story, another graveyard
where we can pay our respects to those who have suffered.</p><p><a href="http://windowsrefund.net" target="_self">WindowsRefund.net</a>
has been created to provide a safe haven for those who have lost
their way in this struggle, as well as to provide guidance to those
that are only now getting involved. I, myself, only recently took a
personal interest in this situation when I purchased a Portege 2000
laptop from Toshiba American Information Systems (TAIS). Although I
was well informed about how I should proceed in my quest to receive
a refund for the unused OS (yes, the tombstones were helpful to
some degree), I have not yet been successful doing so. I continue
to be in pursuit. <i  >Linux Journal</i> published my
original article, called <a href="../000/6318.html" target="_self">&ldquo;The Toshiba
Standoff&rdquo;</a>, on September 13, which describes my ordeal in
greater detail.</p><p>&ldquo;The Toshiba Standoff&rdquo; was a huge success; it received the
attention of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), the Free Software
Foundation (FSF), the New York Linux Scene (NYLXS), Red Hat,
empathetic lawyers, as well as thousands of individuals who
frequent the <i  >LJ</i> web site. Any questions I had
as to whether or not the community still cared about this issue
were put to rest within the first two days of the article's
publication. My inbox was overloaded with e-mails. It became clear
to me that I had not planned my attack as effectively as I could
have, because I had no way to wrap my arms around the explosion
that the article had generated. WindowsRefund.net is my attempt to
do that now. The web site will become the central point of
organization and collaboration as we take this battle to the
courts.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, I have had a chance to hear many
different opinions on the Windows refund debate and feel obligated
to share my thoughts on the most common misconceptions that people
tend to have.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Common Misconception #1:</b></span>
&ldquo;Microsoft is the problem. The OEMs are not at fault.&rdquo;</p><p>There is nothing to win by going after Microsoft for
resolution. The End User License Agreement (EULA) already includes
the provision for a refund. At this point, is is the OEM's
responsibility to make good on this.</p><p>Furthermore, I am a firm believer that human nature justifies
the desire to want more. Too much is never enough. All single
entities are entitled to pursue this unreachable goal. With this in
mind, I place no blame on Microsoft for trying to increase it's
market share. I do, however, blame the OEMs for delivering the
increase. These OEMs have the ability to ship systems without a
preinstalled Microsoft operating system but choose to ignore that
option at the customer's expense. By focusing on Microsoft, we are
avoiding the real issue. Instead, we need to hold the OEMs
accountable and force them to rewrite their policies so that
customers are given a choice. The first step in this change is to
assure that refunds are granted to those who seek them. Only when
customers are given true freedom will the market decide what is
appropriate.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Common Misconception #2:</b></span>
&ldquo;Buy from another vendor.&rdquo;</p><p>This does not fix the problem; it is simply an attempt on the
end user's part to avoid the problem. In the case of a desktop
system, the approach makes more sense because, at the end of the
day, we could always build our own &ldquo;white box&rdquo; using the exact
parts that we require. However, huge differences exist in the
laptop solutions that are being offered today, and no one I know
builds their own laptops. For example, in my opinion, the Portege
2000 that I am writing this article on is second to none when it
comes to my requirements for portability, power and value. By
&ldquo;blacklisting&rdquo; Toshiba's products in an effort to escape the
bundled OS, I would be limiting myself. This is not the
answer.</p><p>One other option available today for the Linux enthusiasts
among us is to buy a system from a vendor like
<a href="http://www.emperorlinux.com" target="_self">EmperorLinux.com</a>.
Unfortunately, the company did not offer the system I wanted, and I
therefore was unable to support their business. To summarize, I
don't believe that customers should have to try and escape this
problem. I believe customers should be free to purchase whatever
product they intend to use and not be strong-armed into paying for
unrelated components.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Common Misconception #3:</b></span>
&ldquo;Some guy in Australia got a refund.&rdquo;</p><p>Good for him. Unfortunately, this is a &ldquo;one in a million&rdquo;
case, and I do not believe these OEMs have created internal
procedures that allow this to happen on an as-needed basis. I have
personally been shocked, time and time again, when speaking to
high-level personnel from both Dell and Toshiba who never even read
the Microsoft EULA. It is the EULA that provides the foundation for
this argument. As long as we continue to not hold the OEMs
accountable, there is no need for them to educate themselves and
create the procedures that we deserve.</p><p>WindowsRefund.net is looking for input from the community.
You can show your support by completing the surveys, sharing your
opinions in the forums, submitting your articles and asking
questions to help the FAQ grow. Securing legal representation is a
high priority at the moment, and I plan to provide news on it's
development through the web site. If you feel you are entitled to a
