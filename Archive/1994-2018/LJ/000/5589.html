matter what the hell Richard Stallman says. Well, actually it does.
The man's uncompromising certitude fronts a set of ethical and
technical convictions (not to mention achievements) that have so
arguably shaped the world we'll never stop arguing about them. But
arguing was not the first order of our week at sea on a
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com" target="_self">Geek Cruise</a> around
the Eastern Caribbean. Schmoozing was. Also eating, drinking,
dancing and hanging out on various decks and lounges between
lectures by V.I.G.s and forays to ports of call.
</p><p>RMS was good company. So were Eric Raymond, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall, Dan Connolly, Michael Johnson, and the hundred-plus other
geeks, family members and affectionate affiliates who shared the
floating venue.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>The author at a precruise
security meeting.</b></span></p></div></div><p>The cruise was created by &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Neil Bauman, who is also
the impresario for
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/jj2_home.html" target="_self">Java
Jam</a>,
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/pw_home.html" target="_self">Perl
Whirl</a>,
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/mm_home.html" target="_self">Mac
Mania</a> and other floating conferences for various computing
constituencies. This one was cosponsored by <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which provided two of the speakers (At the
Forge columnist Reuven Lerner and a certain Senior Editor who
writes the Linux For Suits column), plus a number of other
cruisers, including: Richard Vernon, our Editor in Chief (whom I
referred to in my talk as Se&ntilde;or Editor, owing to his Ph.D.
in Hispanic Literature); Carlie Fairchild, our VP of Sales &amp;
Marketing; Martin Seto, our Northeast Regional salesdude; and Phil
Hughes, our publisher and resident Geek in Chief.
<i  >LJ</i> families also brought along a total of
seven kids. Adult forms of children, however, accounted for about
half the remaining guest list.</p><p>The trip was a trip.</p><p>We left Fort Lauderdale under a balmy and overcast sky on
Sunday, October 21. The light was perfect for hundreds of
near-simultaneous digital photographs, snapping silently on the
forward deck. The ports of call, all visited over the next week in
perfect weather on calm seas near the end of the hurricane season,
took us through the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, and back through the Bahamas again. Our vessel was
the
<a href="http://www.hollandamerica.com/fivestarfleet/maasdam.htm" target="_self">M.S.
Maasdam</a>, an eleven-deck 54,000 ton ocean liner that sails
under the fastidious stewardship of Holland America Lines.</p><p>Built to work as a round-the-clock eating, drinking,
swimming, formal dining and entertainment experience, a cruise like
this is more about relaxing than touring. The shore visits are
almost interruptions: the travel equivalent of <span   class="emphasis"><em>hors
d'ouevres</em></span>, even for standard cruise guests of the
<a href="http://www.princess.com/news/article.jsp?newsArticleId=na1" target="_self">Love
Boat</a> variety. For herds of geeks on the water, however, the
whole thing was more about hanging out and talking techno-trash on
a near-constant basis.</p><p>Designed by Neil as a floating industry conference, the
cruise featured a curriculum of breakouts and keynote speeches. On
Monday, for example, our first full day on the cruise, we spent the
morning docked in Nassau, then followed with a noon-7:45pm series
of six different talks, all at sea, en route to San Juan. These
included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall on Linux pros and cons</p></li><li><p>Reuven Lerner on mod_perl</p></li><li><p>Eric S. Raymond on &ldquo;The Great Brain Race&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Steve Roberts on &ldquo;The Technomadic Life&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><p>Dinner followed. Two nights out of our seven at sea were
formal, and a major hoot. RMS wore his &ldquo;power tie&rdquo; (see pic) one
night and an Ethernet cable on the other. And one of the few times
I've ever seen Maddog actually appear to exemplify his dangerous
name was when he showed up for dinner at our table in a perfectly
tailored tux, hair slicked back over his enormous beard, sporting a
brass-handled cane that turned out to conceal a small beaker of
liquid improvement for the evening's four-course meal. He looked
like Diamond Jim Brady.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>RMS gives a GNU meaning to
power tie.</b></span></p></div></div><p>Some of the most enjoyable talks (all of generous length)
were by folks who make creative use of Linux but fall outside the
usual range of Linux community hubbub. Chief among these was Steve
Roberts, the six-foot-four head of
<a href="http://www.microship.com/" target="_self">Nomadic Research
Labs</a>, which is the corporate expression of his high-profile
nomadic life.</p><p>You had to be isolated from nearly all media to have remained
unexposed to news features about Steve's peripatetic journeys
across the country on a
<a href="http://www.microship.com/bike/index.html" target="_self">series of
recumbent bicycles</a>--the
<a href="http://www.microship.com/bike/winnebiko/index.html" target="_self">Winnebiko
I</a>,
<a href="http://www.microship.com/bike/winnebiko2/index.html" target="_self">Winnebiko
II</a> and finally the
<a href="http://www.microship.com/bike/behemoth/index.html" target="_self">Behemoth</a>--that
were each increasingly encumbered by every imaginable technology,
and then some. Steve's trend, however, was opposite that of our
biological ancestors, since Steve seems to have evolved back toward
the sea with his latest Nomadic effort, The
<a href="http://www.microship.com/microship/index.html" target="_self">Microship
Project</a>.</p><p>Steve is a Polymath of the First Water. He's an inventor, ham
radio operator, circuit board designer and handcrafter of many
useful things, all of which he integrates seamfully into vehicles
powered by human muscle, sunlight and other natural processes. An
interactive schematic of the Microship is
<a href="http://www.microship.com/microship/techinfo/microshipnet/index.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p><p>Sometime soon Steve and his wife Natasha Clarke will depart
for another long trip&mdash;an
<a href="http://www.microship.com/microship/overview/expedition.html" target="_self">expedition</a>--this
one on various US waterways down through the heartland and along
various coasts, on his &amp; hers Microships,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wordplay</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Songline</em></span>.
(We'll be publishing my interview with Steve&mdash;and those with Eric
Raymond and Richard Stallman, among others&mdash;shortly after we're
done transcribing them.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>Steve Roberts and Natasha
Clarke will soon take the Microships
</b></span><span  class="emphasis"><em>Wordplay</em></span> and
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Songline</em></span> on the aquatic equivalent of a road
movie.</p></div></div><p>Natasha was a hoot. When I met her at the first of the
cruise's countless cocktail parties, and mentioned I lived in Santa
Barbara, she yelled &ldquo;You killed Doug Adams! He never would have
gone to a gym in England!&rdquo; Natasha, who hails from London, knew the
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4185990,00.html" target="_self">late
author</a> and shared his pointed sense of humor.</p><p>Cruises like this are no place to go for a diet. The boat
charges for drinks, but pretty much all the food comes with the
price of admission, and in cornucopian abundance. Food seems to
wash over you in tides; not only at scheduled meal times (when many
geeks took the opportunity to order two or more entr&eacute;es),
but at various snacky intervals. There were formal teas in the
two-deck Rembrandt Lounge, hamburger &amp; rib cookouts by the Lido
pool, and an ice cream bar on the Lido level that never seemed to
close. The long buffets in the Lido dining room, where every seat
had an 11th-floor view out the deck's wall of windows, was open to
midnight. Room service was also delivered without additional
charge, and available around the clock.</p><p>The rooms weren't bad, either. We had one of the smallest
cabins, and it served our family of three just fine. I've stayed in
much tinier rooms in fine French hotels. At the top (just below the
Lido), where speakers who registered on time (unlike yours truly,
still kicking himself in the head) were privileged to stay, the
suites were flat-out huge: over 1100 square feet, including an
8-seat living room area and a vast deck overlooking the
ocean.</p><p>Most of the action was indoors, but my favorite outdoor
discovery was the top front deck, a vast wood-floored space below
the forward smoke stacks with their spinning radar, in the wee
hours of the night. Alone on that deck in the darkness, with the
wind sometimes blasting at near-gale velocities, one stood poised
between the immense power of a great ship at sea and the vast
mystery of the whole universe. Unlike the land-lit dome that covers
civilization, here the sky was Infinitude itself. Stars glowed in
the great black Nothing. Spread from one horizon to the other, the
wide middle of the Milky Way, in Sagittarius, loomed high overhead.
To the Northeast, near Cassiopeia, glowed its nearest neighbor, the
Andromeda Galaxy. One could almost sense the perspective, looking
from the midst of one galaxy toward another.</p><p>Appropriately, our best shore excursion came in Puerto Rico,
when we visited the
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/about/ao/telefact.htm" target="_self">Arecibo
Observatory</a>, which looks like an enormous salad bowl held
captive in a mountain redoubt and subjected to strange experiments
by vast steel spiders. We learned a surprising amount about the
system, and the Puerto Rican countryside we drove through to reach
it, from our guide, Gonzolo de Leon, who was built like a weight
lifter, smart as a whip and much funnier than any of the official
on-ship entertainment.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f4.jpg"></div><p>The business end of the Arecibo
telescope is a 900 ton contraption suspended from steel bridge
cables above a vast bowl of aluminum mesh. That thing draped to the
upper right is an aerial catwalk. Perspective: the geodesic
&ldquo;Gregorian dome&rdquo; hanging like a goiter from the bottom of the
platform is 85 feet in diameter and contains control rooms filled
with cool computational gear as well as radio transmitting and
receiving systems. The
<a href="http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/users/iotm/IOTMS/9611/arecibo.html" target="_self">dish</a>
below is 1000 feet wide.
</p><p>The telescope itself is a mathematical and engineering marvel
that Every geek whose Linux (or whatever) system works its idle
hours <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" target="_self">searching
for extraterrestrial intelligence</a> (since we understand the
Earthbound shortage all too well ) looks into space through the
Arecibo system, where
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/radio_search_3.html" target="_self">most
of the SETI data is collected</a>. Now that I've been
<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/arecibo_profile_000508.html" target="_self">reading
up</a> on the whole Arecibo/SETI setup, I wish I had done more
research before the trip. Maybe one of the SETI scientists would
make a good onboard speaker for the cruise. (Hey Cap'n Neal,
whaddaya think?)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>Leaders of the Free Software
and Open Source movements agree respectfully to decline joining a
local scientist in worship of native
technology.</b></span></p></div></div><p>The only technological disappointment on the trip, but
perhaps a fortuitous one, was the ship's Internet cafe, which
presented the Net in 640x480 dimensions through a customized
Microsoft Internet Explorer browser that cost $.75/minute or
$99.95/week to use. Apparently some of us (myself included, I am
sure) inadvertently insulted the uniformed professional assigned to
assist guests normally far less Net-hip than our contingency. She
was not happy with campers who insulted her system verbally&mdash;or
worse, tried to crawl under the tables and hack into it physically.
Using the system, however, made me want to rant through an
Arecibo-grade bullhorn at brain-dead info delivery services that
never seem to get that the Net is a place no less vast and free
than the oceans and the stars:</p><p>Earth to Commerce: The Net belongs to nobody because we&mdash;your
geeks&mdash;made it for every member of a species hungry for knowledge
and human contact. We have no problem with any hospitality service
charging us for access to it. But we don't like it dumbed down, or
given a browser interface that's even more commercial than the ones
we're already forced to use. Thank you.</p><p>Anyway, the net result was to be cast at sea without a Net.
For geeks who tend to live in cyberspace (approximately 100% of
those aboard), this was a fortuitous blessing that forced far more
socializing than might otherwise have occurred. (Late bulletin:
Captain Neal has since informed me that future
<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/" target="_self">cruises</a> will
feature geek-grade Net connectivity, via both wired and wireless
links from guest laptops.)</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f6.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Maddog and RMS (hacking happily on
GNU/Linux, we suspect) both strike their best Tux poses on the
beach at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas. RMS's intent, by the way (in
his
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html" target="_self">work</a>
as well as this photo), is to replace the penguin with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/graphics/agnuhead.html" target="_self">a different
animal</a>
</p><p>Spared nearly all temptation to borg into the Net, I found
the best part of the trip was hanging out with fellow geeks and
colleagues, including luminaries with whom I'd never spent much
time, casual or otherwise, in the past. Eric Raymond, for example,
is an old pal. But I've never had much hang time with, say,
<a href="http://www.li.org/who/bio.php?name=hall" target="_self">maddog</a>
or <a href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_self">RMS</a>. Our own
Richard (whom I call <span   class="emphasis"><em>Se&ntilde;or Editor</em></span>,
owing to his Ph.D. in Hispanic Literature, a degree as marginally
relevant to his current occupation as my own background as a
marketing dweeb and joke radio personality) has already
<a href="../000/5590.html" target="_self">/article/5590</a>
covered the maddog issue, so I won't go there. I talked with RMS at
some length, and have hours of tape to transcribe. You should see
it up on the Web as soon as I finish transcribing it and running it
past both Richards.</p><p>I'm a long way from understanding RMS as well as I would
like. But for now I'll just say that it's clear to me that the man
has an understanding of software that is extraordinarily deep. His
knowledge of <span   class="emphasis"><em>what software is and why it
matters</em></span> is too easy to overlook or discredit when we're
busy arguing about licensing, business models and the rest of the
stuff that soaks up so much geek time&mdash;while remaining ironically
opaque to those for whom software is just another form of property.
That software has properties that resist ownership is just one of
the inconveniences that Richard is determined to help the rest of
us remember.</p><p>Okay, back to the Cruise.</p><p>The best purely Caribbean shore trip, by popular acclaim, was
<a href="http://www.vinow.com/" target="_self">St. Thomas</a>, where most
of the <i  >LJ</i> contingency took a water taxi to a
<a href="http://www.vinow.com/stthomas/beaches_stt/beaches.php3" target="_self">perfect
beach</a> on the far side of the island while I hacked away at
the keynote talk I would give that evening.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5589f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="bold"><b>My keynote talk, &ldquo;Migrating
from Antarctica: A Progress Report on Linux in the Land of the
Suits,&rdquo; is
<a href="http://www.searls.com/geek_cruise_2001_ds/ds_2001geekcruise_keynote/index.html" target="_self">here</a></b></span></p></div></div><p>.
</p><p>Fortunately I still got a shore trip on Half Moon Cay, our
last port of call. Never heard of it? There's a good reason. It was
called
<a href="http://www.attrill.freeserve.co.uk/littlesansal.htm" target="_self">Little
San Salvador</a> until it was bought by Holland America, which
<a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Bahamas/LittleSanSalvadorHalfMoonCay" target="_self">renamed</a>
it. The company maintains a skeleton crew of just six people on the
island. They put much effort into protecting the island's unspoiled
nature until the big ships show up and proceed to turn the place
into something like a small town on a long curving beach. This
state persists until about 3pm, when the crew breaks the set after
all the guests have been herded on tender boats back to the mother
ship.</p><p>On the island I had an enjoyable talk with one of the
lifeguards, a woman who spoke with such a perfect native accent
that I was sure she hadn't come from our big boat.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you live here?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No. Over there,&rdquo; she said, pointing at the horizon.</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There. See the island?&rdquo;</p><p>I noticed a narrow margin of gray poking up over the far edge
of the blue Atlantic. Then several others broad lumps at some
distance to the right and left.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. Which island is yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They're all one island:
<a href="http://users.powernet.co.uk/mkmarina/bahamas/eleuthera.html" target="_self">Eleuthera</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really. How big is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About 110 miles long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many people live there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know. Maybe ten thousand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you come here for the day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. By boat. It's about eighteen miles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you ever think about leaving your island, or the
Bahamas?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no. It's paradise.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
