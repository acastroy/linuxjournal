       How about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Harried Admin meets Savvy Automount</em></span>?
       Probably not (in either case), but it's my way of introducing another installment of the
       <span   class="bold"><b>SysAdmin's Corner</b></span> right here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>
       on-line. It's great to see all your smiling faces again.
     </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdac580.0xea42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last time around, we went through the process of setting up a NIS
server.  Although it's great that we've done the job of setting up
the NIS server, it isn't much good without clients.
Luckily, clients are fairly simple, so feel free to set up lots of them.
On the client system, start by opening the file <pre     class="programlisting">/etc/yp.conf</pre>
in your favorite editor (go ahead, I dare you).  There are three possible
ways of setting up the client to look for NIS servers.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     domain NISDOMAIN server HOSTNAME
     #       Use server HOSTNAME for the domain NISDOMAIN.

</pre>
</p><p>If you choose this method, then specify the NISDOMAIN and the HOSTNAME
to which you would like the client to connect.  You can have more than
one such entry.  Using my example of domain.nis, my <pre     class="programlisting">yp.conf</pre>
entry would look like this.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     domain mydomain.nis server testsys.mydomain.dom

</pre>
</p><p>You can also set up your client to listen for NIS servers via a
broadcast.  The only catch here is the servers must be on the
same subnet.  You can not listen for NIS servers outside your network.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     domain NISDOMAIN broadcast
     #       Use  broadcast  on  the local net for domain NISDOMAIN

</pre>
</p><p>Once again, you replace NISDOMAIN with the NIS domain name.  The
advantage of this method is you only need to configure one entry,
and you are done.  The final option is perhaps the easiest of the bunch,
in terms of flexibility.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     ypserver HOSTNAME
     #       Use server HOSTNAME for the  local  domain.

</pre>
</p><p>Type the hostname of the NIS server, and that's it.  If you
are going to use this approach, however, you had better make sure the
<span   class="bold"><b>HOSTNAME</b></span> is listed in <pre     class="programlisting">/etc/hosts</pre> file.  For my
test, I used the final example with this entry.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     ypserver testsys

</pre>
</p><p>One last file needs editing, and we are finished.  This one is called
/etc/nsswitch.conf and while there is a lot more stuff here
than in yp.conf, the format is no more difficult.  Basically,
you have a list of file names and one or more service options associated
with each one.  Here's a sample from my file which is basically the
stock configuration from a Red Hat system.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     passwd:     files nisplus nis
     shadow:     files nisplus nis
     group:      files nisplus nis

     #hosts:     db files nisplus nis dns
     hosts:      files nisplus nis dns

</pre>
</p><p>The service options are <span   class="bold"><b>files</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>nis</b></span>
(or <span   class="bold"><b>yp</b></span> - both are the same), <span   class="bold"><b>nisplus</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dns</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>[NOTFOUND=return]</b></span>.   Okay,
here's a bit more detail.  The files options means we should use
the local files to look up information.  On the other hand, nis (or
yp) tells the system to use NIS for the information.
Then, we have nisplus (use NIS+), dns (use the DNS to find the
information : note that this only applies to the hosts file) and, finally,
[NOTFOUND=return] which means &ldquo;if you haven't found the information,
stop searching&rdquo;.</p><p>Of course, each file has several options listed which can only mean
the order is somehow important.  This is the search order for
information retrieval: you almost always want to search your local
host first, so files is usually the first option.  It is only when you
don't find the information locally that you want to look elsewhere,
but even that can be changed.</p><p>Let's test things, shall we?  First things first.  As with the server,
you need to have the NIS domain name set.  You still want the information
hard-coded in the appropriate configuration files, but a quick way to
set it (if you haven't already) is with the <span   class="bold"><b>domainname</b></span> command.  Now,
remember, we are working on the client this time.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     domainname mydomain.nis

</pre>
</p><p>Cool!  Now, we need to start <span   class="bold"><b>yppasswdd</b></span>
(to allow for password changes on the NIS server) and the NIS
listener, <span   class="bold"><b>ypbind</b></span>.   With Debian, this is the
/etc/init.d/nis start script.  With Red Hat, you'll need to start
/etc/rc.d/init.d/yppasswdd and /etc/rc.d/init.d/ypbind
as well.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>You can just feel the tension, can't you?</em></span>  To see the contents
of the NIS server's password file, try this command.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     ypcat passwd

</pre>
</p><p>I won't bore you with the contents of my central password file
&lt;insert appropriate evil grin here&gt;.  Suffice to say that if
you did everything right, you should see the contents of the password
file.  Notice, however, <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> the entries after
the <span   class="bold"><b>MINUID</b></span> you set last time around (see the last
column on setting up the NIS server <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5299" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5299</a>) are actually visible.</p><p>
Let's try another.  To get the host information, do this.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     ypcat hosts

</pre>
</p><p>The format is simple.  You are simply specifying the name of the file
served by NIS services.</p><p>I am going to leave NIS for now.  There are still a couple more
things on this topic I want to talk about, but for now, we'll do
something else.  In order to address that something else, I need to
ask you all a few questions.</p><p>Are you feeling tired? Listless?
Has the constant flow of life-giving caffeine stopped
having the desired effect?  Do you find yourself absendmindedly saying &ldquo;sure, I'll mount that
file system for you&rdquo; whenever someone walks into your
office?  Are you constantly trying to remember whether you've set up
shares to this directory or that one?  Is your network getting bogged
down by hundreds of unnecessary NFS (or SAMBA) mounts that you only use
occasionally, but can't bear the thought of mounting and unmounting every
time you need them?  If you've answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to any of these questions,
then I may have something to help you.</p><p>If you start using NFS in a big way, you may find this
whole business of mounting and unmounting file systems gets
to be a bit <span   class="emphasis"><em>tedious</em></span>.  You could just put the various
mounts in your /etc/fstab (as we talked about in the
 first
 part of this series <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4710" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4710</a>) and have them come up automatically, but that
has its problems as well.  What if that system is not always available?
It may also be that you only need this file system from time to time.
If this is the case, you don't want to have it permanently mounted.
Then again, when somebody does need it, do you really want them to disturb you?</p><p>The Linux command <span   class="bold"><b>autofs</b></span> can make your life a lot easier.
The idea is you define file systems for mounting in a file called a
<span   class="bold"><b>map</b></span> file.  This map describes the file system
types, where they are and what permissions may be required to mount them.
The beauty is you don't have to manually mount these file systems
or even have them mounted at all.  As soon as a user requests something in the
map path, that file system is automatically mounted.  Does it sound
too good to be true?   Fear not.  It's all real.</p><p>To use this tool, you will need to have the autofs
package loaded on your system.  You will find it is probably
already on your distribution CD.   Alternatively, you can go to the
<a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org" target="_self">ftp.kernel.org</a> web site and look in the
/pub/linux/daemons/autofs directory for the latest and greatest.</p><p>Setup is easy.  Start by setting up your /etc/auto.master
file.  The format is as follows.  You define a top level directory
where your automatic mounts occur.  This points back to another file
(your map) which takes care of individually defining
these mounts and their file system types.  Here's my auto.master
file now.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     /automnt\t\t/etc/auto.automnt

</pre>
</p><p>You can have many such definitions.  For instance, you might have mount
points defined under /misc, /home or the perennial
/mnt.  The convention is to use a /etc/auto.map file
where "map" is the same name as the mount point.  You can use pretty
much any name you like, however, and it will still work.  Now, let's
have a look at the map I have defined.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     # automount locations
     # This is an automounter map and it has the following format
     # key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location

     # nfs servers
     testsysdata        -fstype=nfs,rsize=8192,wsize=8192          testsys:/data1
     testsysroot        -fstype=nfs,rsize=8192,wsize=8192          testsys:/

     # samba servers
     testsysdos\t\t-fstype=smb,username=marcel,password=secret\t://testsys/dosdir
     winsoft\t\t-fstype=smb\t\t://nexus/win95

     # Windows PCs
     natika_c\t\t-fstype=smb,username=natika,password=secret         ://speedy/natika_c

</pre>
</p><p>Notice I have listed Samba file systems (which I haven't
talked about yet) and a Windows PC as well.  The Linux autofs can
handle many different systems; it's not just for NFS.  Before we can
start using things, though, we need to start (or restart) the autofs process.
On my test system running Red Hat, I start it from a script</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     /etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs start

</pre>
</p><p>On a Debian system, the script will likely be in /etc/init.d
instead, but it will use the same keyword to start the automounter.
By the way, the program that actually does the work is called
<span   class="bold"><b>automount</b></span> so if you look for the program in a &ldquo;ps
ax&rdquo;, you'll see that program name instead of autofs, which is just
the package name.</p><p>To access information on any of these systems, I only need to change
the directory or reference a file there.  The autofs system will do the
rest for me.</p><p>
<pre     class="programlisting">

     cd /automnt/natika_c
     ls

</pre>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Voila!</em></span>  Miraculously, I can see the entire contents of Natika's C drive!</p><p>Well, that wraps up another week for your humble geek and narrator.
Until next we meet on this most sunny of corners, remember what your
Momma said, &ldquo;It's nice to share&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
