    For a fast machine on a budget, buy hardware one generation
    old.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcd2580.0xdca240"></a></h2></div></div><p>In your big-box stores, most computer
systems are running between $600 and $700 at a minimum, and some
run well into the four-figure range. All of them include an extra
couple of hundred bucks' worth of unnecessary proprietary software.
Considering these realities, one begins to wonder what it would
take to roll one's own hardware, just as one would compile a
kernel. Recently, Don Marti asked me that very question, and at his
request, I'm sharing my response with you.</p><p>The goal here is to put together the best bang-for-buck basic
workstation. There is a point on any price list from which further
improvements get really expensive; we want to aim just below that
point. This aim translates to one-generation-back technology&mdash;the
stuff that's still new in the box, but is last year's model and can
be had at a bargain. This machine isn't the Ultimate Linux Box,
however; this is simply something you can use to get on the Web, do
your taxes and maybe play a game or two of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TuxRacer</em></span>.</p><p>A wander through my favorite computer store reveals a couple
of things that stand out as places to start a design, simply
because they are dirt cheap: PC-133 memory and AMD Duron
processors. These items pretty much determine what kind of
motherboard we will use&mdash;something with a socket A and SDRAM slots.
When I built my own box some months ago, I went with a Chaintech
7AJA2E, based on the VIA KT-133 chipset. It has the advantage of
fast UDMA-100 IDE disk controllers while still taking the older
memory. It also has on-board audio that, while not the best, will
do for being on a budget. New, motherboard and CPU (an AMD Duron
1.1GHz) run about $50 each; memory, a generic 256MB DIMM, was about
$45. More memory is better if you can afford it; more processor
speed, however, is overkill. (My wife does her work just fine on a
K6-2/300 I built several years ago.)</p><p>Okay, now that we have the basics, we need something to put
it in. Cases these days run from your basic no-name cheap case, at
about $25, to the all-aluminum Lian Li's, which is in the
three-figure range. I'm partial to neither, because neither case
absorbs the kind of punishment a hardware geek will give it over
several years of upgrades, taking it apart and putting it back
together time and again. I used to be hooked on Enlights; two of
them lurk here under the computer table in the hobbit-hole. My new
hotrod, however, is in a Future P4300W, whose sides come off
independently of the front. It also has a pair of USB ports hiding
under a panel at the bottom front edge. Forty bucks gets you the
plain silver hood; colors and windows are extra. Enermax also makes
a case in this range, and they are known for good power supplies.
But pick the one <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> like. After all, you've
got to live with it.</p><p>Also something to consider here: you'll come out a lot better
buying a case with the power supply already in it. Purchasing the
power supply separately can cost as much as the case, and you're
not guaranteed to get any better performance. The idea here is
inexpensive and serviceable, not zero to a terahertz in four
seconds.</p><p>Well, we almost have enough here to get a BIOS screen, so
let's add video. This is an area where you can pick up almost
anything cheap and it will work. Matrox G200s, nVIDIA RIVA TNTs,
ATI Rage Pro, even the venerable Voodoo line all handle 3-D, though
you may wish to go up a notch and get a GeForce 2 or a Radeon. If
you're going to do serious gaming, the GPU is where it's at, but if
you're only going to run a browser, you don't need a whole lot of
horsepower. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> sink a lot of cost here on
something fancy, but then we'd be building a gamer's box. On the
other hand, a low-end Radeon or GeForce card runs about $50. The
ATI cards take the standard XFree86 drivers. Matrox and nVIDIA both
offer downloads for their accelerated drivers. I have seen cases
where running the nVIDIA drivers on their smaller cards was
actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>slower</em></span> than the regular VESA driver,
at least in 2-D mode. Purists will want to go non-nVIDIA anyway, as
the driver contains a non-GPL kernel module. I'm no purist. You
decide.</p><p>Another cost consideration: AGP actually is cheaper than PCI
in low-end cards. I surmise this is because everybody has an AGP
slot these days, and thus the demand for AGP cards drives the
production rate up and the cost down. I see the same phenomenon in
PC-100 RAM versus PC-133.</p><p>Now for the pricey part of our little shopping
expedition&mdash;drives. As of this writing, it looks like the break
point is about $100, for which you can get somewhere between 40 and
60GB, 80 if you're lucky. As luck would have it, Seagate recently
released its shiny new line of serial ATA drives, which means the
price of its 40GB Barracuda, a drive I've admired for quite a
while, has broken the $100 barrier. Maxtors and IBM's can be had
for similar coin; Western Digitals seem to run a bit more. Of
course, even if you fire up Red Hat or Mandrake and click on
&ldquo;Everything&rdquo;, this is an incredible amount of space for your basic
e-surfboard. Then again, it may not seem like so much after you rip
your CD collection to OGGs.</p><p>And this leads me to our next item, the CD-RW device. You
need some way to back up the system, some way to install it and
something to do with all those OGG files. Plain CD-R has become
pass&eacute; in the last few months; your basic RW device runs
$60-140, depending on how impatient you are. If your motherboard
supports USB 2.0 (or you want to buy a PCI USB controller), you can
buy an external USB one and share it around, if you like. The older
motherboards may not boot from USB either, though, making
installation painful. Best to stick with IDE here, and don't be
afraid to go cheap unless you need fast. The $60 one will do just
fine.</p><p>We mustn't forget our old friend the floppy drive. How else
are you going to upgrade the BIOS? (Don't forget to do that later.)
If you're paying $20 for one, you're getting ripped off, but don't
leave it out either. Sometimes it's the fastest way to sneakernet
across that critical file you <b  >rm</b>ed.</p><p>Speaking of sneakernet, you need a way to communicate with
the outside world. If you're stuck in dial-up world, you'll need a
modem. External is best, albeit pricey, but you don't want to have
to reboot Linux and spoil your three-digit uptime because the modem
flaked. If you need to go internal for the savings, make sure you
don't buy a Winmodem; you can tell this if it calls for a Pentium
II rather than a 486.</p><p>Unless this machine is your only computer and you're
modem-bound, you'll need at least one network card. The little
Netgear units are cheap and ubiquitous; they take either the
Natsemi driver or the Tulip. If the installer doesn't know for sure
already, pick one and try it; if it doesn't work, use the other
one. Other good and cheap 10/100 cards include RealTek's 8139,
which is sold under a number of brands, and the Linksys and D-Link
cards. Basically, if it's a PCI card, it probably will work. Even
Intel's e100-based cards have come down into the $20 range, minus
all the bells and whistles. You can get away with 10baseT-only
cards in a pinch; after all, it's not like you'll be able to drive
more than that on your outside link, even on a cable modem.</p><p>(Driver consideration: If you use the Intel, be sure to get
the latest e100 driver for it, if your distro doesn't already have
one. The eepro100 driver has issues if you start hammering it, for
instance, moving all those OGGs off your old machine. As of this
writing, Red Hat 8.0 has the driver, but Debian Woody does not. The
new versions are GPL; RMS would be proud.)</p><p>One more thing and we're done: you'll need a cooler for that
CPU. This is where <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> being a hotrod saves us
even more dough. Gigahertz-class Durons don't throw heat like the
old Thunderbirds or the high-end Palamino-core Athlons. You can get
away with a sub-$10 fan if that's all you wanted to spend. One
thing to look for, though, are slow fans. I made the mistake of
picking up a 7,000 RPM DragonOrb when I built my current box, which
sounded like an idling jet engine from the other end of my
apartment. Needless to say, I got another, slower fan. Thermaltake
makes a few good ones; the Volcano 6 has a copper base, a 4,500 RPM
fan and lists for $15.</p><p>By my count, we have spent $50 a piece for motherboard and
CPU, $45 each for memory and case (I took the color upgrade on the
FutureCase), another $50 for video, an even three figures for the
drive, $60 for the CD-RW, $20 for the NIC and $15 each for the
floppy and cooler. Total cost, $450 plus tax (and shipping, if
you'd rather stay in your nice dark office and let FedEx do all the
walking around).</p><p>But this was supposed to be a dirt cheap machine, you say.
Here's where we begin to be really resourceful. These are retail
prices are for all new equipment. But, we're Linux geeks; we don't
pay for software, why should we pay full price for hardware? Get on
your local Linux User Group's mailing list (if you aren't already,
you should be) and ask where the good second-hand computer stores
are. You might find something in this class you can spruce up. Or
maybe they'll have something a touch slower&mdash;a lot of K6-2 machines
are floating around. Extra memory, as we've said, is cheap; add a
decent 3-D video card, and you're set. Sound can be added with a
SoundBlaster of some variety, and a used one costs $15 or less.
Drives are another place where you can save lots of cash; used ones
can be had for around a buck a gig, and if you're not hogging OGGs,
you don't need the extra space. If you're feeling really cheap,
Debian can be shoehorned into 2GB reasonably comfortably, but you
might wish to stay with at least UDMA-33 drives for performance.
That should put you in the 10-20GB range. If you're adding to a
fleet of machines, and already have a CD-RW elsewhere, you can get
a cheap CD-ROM drive, put it in your machine and move files across
the network to burn. Another option, the one I used, is to put the
cheap drive in the old machine, which happened to be slower, and
put the RW in the shiny new box. Floppies can be had from your own
old machines, or if you're fresh out, pick one up second-hand for
$5. Stay with the good video card unless you're building a server;
you'll wish you had if you don't. (Smart shopping might get you
something around $30, but make sure the chipset is what you think
it is. If XFree86 doesn't recognize it, you'll be stuck with plain
VESA mode, which is painful at best.)</p><p>You should be able to get a second-hand box for around $100,
add memory and a CD-RW and come out with something quite usable for
under $250. On the plus side, the older boxes don't need as much
cooling (if you avoid Thunderbirds, which run hot) and therefore
are quieter. And because Linux runs on practically anything these
days, you can upgrade the system a bit at a time, which will save
interest on your already well-worn credit cards.</p><p>Of course, with all the money you've saved, you might want to
get yourself a second drive. Either RAID them both with software or
with a little Promise controller ($20), the latter of which is also
a good way to get UDMA-100 performance into an older machine, or
simply run one system and one data and keep good backups. Splitting
up your filesystems also enables you to run XMMS while doing
something else data-intensive (like burning CDs or compiling the
kernel) on the other drive, even on older hardware. But, make sure
you've got things spread out across controllers. To be safe, I
would put the system onboard primary, the writer on secondary and
any auxiliary drives on the extra controller.</p><p>So there you have it. Cheap Penguin Gold, $450; the Silver
model, minor scratches, $250; or Platinum, with RAID-1, $570. Happy
hacking!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Glenn Stone</b></span> is a Red Hat
