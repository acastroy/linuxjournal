    Enterprise-level CAD software comes to Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbcc580.0xcc4138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sana Abou-Haidar is a Marketing Manager
at Matra DataVision, a company with a middle- to high-end CASE CAD
product. This product is a set of components for the development of
trade-specific technical and scientific modeling applications
ranging from CAD/CAM/CAE to metrology and measuring machines,
biomedical software, 3-D geological mapping, optical simulation,
product design and styling. Matra is releasing the Linux version of
this product as open source on December 20, and will also be open
sourcing the software for other platforms as well. I talked to Sana
by phone on December 10.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Why don't you begin
by telling me a bit about the product?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: Okay; the product is
Open CASCADE, and basically, Open CASCADE is open source for
CAS.CADE. CAS.CADE is Case for CAD computer-aided software
engineering for computer-aided applications and is made up of a
number of software components dedicated to the development to
scientific and technical applications. You know, graphic
applications. They deal with geometric modeling with visualization,
data exchange between a number of different graphic applications,
etc.</p><p>Now, to give you just an idea about this CASCADE product,
it's been marketed by Matra DataVision since 1995. So this product
is not coming straight out of research or anything&mdash;it's
market-tested since 1995. Our customer base today is made up of
industrials with specific developments of ISVs (independent
software vendors) and a number of research and education institutes
in Europe and the United States. CASCADE generates a yearly revenue
for Matra-DataVision of about 3.5 million dollars in a market that
is about 24-25 million dollars. So it's a bit more than 10% of that
market.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It sounds like it is
a very high-end product.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: Well, it is medium-
and high-end. CASCADE has a number of classes, because it is in C++
and object technology dealing with basic graphics and geometry, but
also with very high-end classes that deal with complicated modeling
algorithms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How did y'all decide
to go about becoming open source?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: Well, first of all, as
I mentioned, the yearly revenue generated by CASCADE was 3.5
million dollars in an already-limited market. We have estimated
that our going into open source would enable to us to go outside
this market into a much bigger one and into a very innovated
business model much more oriented to our services. Let me explain a
bit about the market perspective, the new market perspectives, and
then about the service business model.</p><p>First of all, the market perspective. Today, we estimate the
market of services around technical applications, CAD, CAM and
general scientific and technical applications at six billion
dollars. That is Dataquest information. In that six billion
dollars, we estimate you have one billion for the market of
specific technical application development. In those services, you
see the development is about one billion dollars. Now, that market
consists of about half the Matra's extensions of CAD, CAM and half
generally available commercial applications, which can be
customized if you wish. The other half is taken up mostly by
technical, specific development based totally on proprietary
information. There is one small part of that market, about 25
million dollars, which is technical application development; based
on components&mdash;commercial components like CASCADE. By going open
source, we feel we will be able to extend our component sale
business model into the proprietary development section of that
market which is much bigger&mdash;about 450 million dollars. I told you
it is about half, the total market of specific technical
application development, because people are not buying components
on which they are basing their development; they are using a tool
that becomes their own tool. Since it is available as open source
and they can go into it, debug it, use it, they don't have to pay
runtime licenses, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How do you make
money, then?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: The business we are
hoping to catch is the service and support part of that business.
Meaning, those people with needs for the development of technical
applications who will require support for use of Open CASCADE, and
those who need training. Since it's a development product, you have
to master a number of things: how to use it, how to use it best,
etc. Many industrial companies will be attracted to it and
understand its potential, but will not want to do their own
development, as development is not their core business. These
companies will ask us to do the specific development for them. Our
business model is based on support and specific development around
Open CASCADE.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Has CASCADE always
supported UNIX and Linux, or is this new?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: CASCADE has supported
UNIX for the past six years and is now available on Linux. On
December 20, 1999, Open CASCADE will be published on the Linux
platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So Open CASCADE will
be Linux only?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: No, that is only part
of our publication plan. Our first publication on December 20 will
be on the Linux platform, then at the end of January we are
publishing the Windows NT and Sun platforms, then later we will be
publishing Silicon Graphics, IBM, AIX, etc. We are having a
frequent and regular publication plan.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Okay, well that
sounds like you are truly supportive of open source&mdash;that you are
going all the way with it. Some companies in the past have stuck to
the &ldquo;we are open for Linux but not for the Windows and everything
else&rdquo; model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: We thought about that,
but no, no, no, no! We decided the Open CASCADE product would be
total open source, and our whole function. This is the ideal moment
to tell you we have a web site at
<a href="http://www.opencascade.org" target="_self">http://www.opencascade.org/</a>
that is basically our open-source web site. This is where we are
going to contribute by putting the developments to the Open CASCADE
product. This is where we are going to create a whole community of
people using and contributing to Open CASCADE. This is where we are
going to establish a core team (50 people) of project leaders who
are going to push the projects they are interested in. You see, it
is very oriented toward open source; it is true open source. We
have decided to base the business model on the service part, so the
development part can be true open source. The license is completely
LGPL-compliant.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That will please
everyone.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: It is completely LGPL,
meaning all debugs and modifications to existing code must be
published as open source. However, today we have an install base of
independent software vendors and industrial people using that
software, so in our license, we say developers of new components or
applications which we call &ldquo;derived works&rdquo; have the choice to
publish or not publish as they wish. This is exactly
LGPL-compliant. What we develop, we are going to publish.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: You keep referring
to Open CASCADE; is it a different product from the one you
sold?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: No, it is exactly the
same product in terms of functionality. It is just that we have
made it more modular. We have established quality criteria to make
it easily downloadable, etc. But in terms of functionality of
parameters, you have the basic geometry, the high-end topology, the
high-end algorithms, and the visualization. We also have a very
interesting feature that is quite innovative and it is not
available in any of our competitor's products. It is called the
Open CASCADE Application Framework. Basically, it is a rapid
application development framework which gives you a ready-made
template for your application, and all the objects you create will
be automatically stored in the template. You can assign
non-geometric attributes to the application object. You can undo or
redo all the operations on the object; you can store the
modifications to the data models. So it is a very high-end feature
and it will also be open source, even though it has cost us a lot
of money to develop it. I'm sure in the end, it will bring in a lot
of money and resources.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It sounds like Matra
is truly committed to everything the open-source people have been
advocating&mdash;the idea that people can develop high-quality source,
give it away, and still be able to make money. Y'all seem to have a
very good working model going here, and I'm sure it will be very
welcome in the Linux community.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sana</b></span>: In addition to the
service and specific development business model, we will also have
a component gallery which we will be exhibiting on the
<a href="http://www.opencascade.com" target="_self">http://www.opencascade.com/</a>
site. This component gallery will be like a portal and will include
all kinds of components which can be used to develop technical
applications. They can be created by us or our partners; they don't
have to be open source, but they can be. It will be the ideal
place&mdash;the reference place&mdash;to find everything you need in terms of
technical application development, graphics, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thanks very much for
talking to us.</p></div></div>
