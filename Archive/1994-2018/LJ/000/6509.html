    Printers: cheap, networked or color&mdash;pick two.
    Right?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19dd580.0x1ad5240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Like many home office users, I have a
network-capable laser printer, and I appreciate being able to print
conveniently from anywhere on the network. Until I needed
color.</p><p>A network-capable color printer would have broken the money
and space budgets, besides being total overkill for occasional
color use. Unfortunately, inexpensive inkjets, such as the HP
DeskJet 5550 that we chose for its print quality and
<a href="http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_self">free
software driver</a>, tend to have only USB and parallel
ports.</p><p><a href="http://www.hawkingtech.com/prodSpec.php?ProdID=91" target="_self">Hawking
PN7127P 1-Port Mini-Internet Print Server</a> to the rescue.
This tiny printer server mentioned Linux on the box, an encouraging
sign. The price, around $60 at an electronics mega-store, was
reasonable too. Besides Linux, it supports Novell NetWare,
Microsoft Windows, UNIX and Apple Mac OS.</p><p>The Hawking unit connects easily to HP's parallel port,
without a cable. Besides the printer connection, there is a
connector for the +5V wall wart and an RJ45 for Ethernet. A green
&ldquo;link&rdquo; LED comes on when the network is connected, and a yellow
&ldquo;status&rdquo; LED flashes for power-on self tests and error
conditions.</p><p><a href="http://www.hawkingtech.com/printserver.php#I%20am%20having%20trouble%20setting%20the%20print%20server%20up%20with%20LINUX.%20%20How%20do%20I%20set%20this%20up" target="_self">A
FAQ item on Hawking's site</a> explains how to assign the unit
an IP address. Go to any Linux system on the LAN and do this as
root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arp -s <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.1.2 00:40:01:20:70:ad</em></span>
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>192.168.1.2</em></span> is the IP address we
want to assign, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>00:40:01:20:70:ad</em></span> is the
MAC address. Hawking conveniently prints the MAC address on a label
placed on the unit. After the unit sets its address as given in the
arp command, you can ping it. Better yet, you can point your web
browser at it and set up such features as SNMP and DHCP. I chose to
put it on DHCP so it is consistent with all the other computers and
devices on the network.</p><p>A later look at the manual revealed that although most of the
manual is devoted to cumbersome point-and-click navigation through
proprietary OS dialogs, the arp command also is documented. Because
of the PN7127's clean design, nothing about setting it up requires
any software installation on your Linux hosts nor the use of any
other OS.</p><p>The web interface is thorough and well-designed. You should
certainly, however, check to make sure the unit is installed in
private address space and not where it is reachable from the
outside.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19dd580.0x1ad5818"></a>Ready to Print</h2></div></div><p>The only hard part about setting up this box was finding the
space to fit its wall wart into an overcrowded power strip. I use
Ghostscript with
<a href="http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/install.php" target="_self">hpijs</a>
to convert PostScript files to the format used by the HP printer
and the handy rplr utility to test print them over the net without
having to change the lpd setup. You can try this or, if you want to
do it the easy way, simply set up another network printer in your
distribution's printer setup tool.</p><p>Depending on your printer and distribution version, you may
need to get a more recent version of hpijs. I had to do an upgrade
to get the version that supports the HP DeskJet 5550. If you're
already using the printer when it's directly attached to a Linux
system's parallel or USB port, however, you shouldn't have to
change anything in the Ghostscript or hpijs department.</p><p>The Hawking PN7127P solves an important problem&mdash;connecting
multiple systems to one printer&mdash;in a refreshingly straightforward
and platform-neutral way. By thinking ahead and building a unit
based on standards, Hawking has done home Linux users, and those
with a diversity of systems, a useful service.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Marti</b></span> is editor in chief
