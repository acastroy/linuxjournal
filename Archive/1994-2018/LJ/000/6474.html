    How to build your own dedicated distribution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x1db3298"></a></h2></div></div><p>The exploitation of Linux potentialities
on x86 platforms increased quite a lot in the last few years, but
an entire field of applications seems to me to be extremely
underdeveloped. I am referring to dedicated CD mini-distributions,
namely Linux distributions that live on a CD, contain exactly the
software needed to run some particular application and
automatically start that application at the boot. That is, they use
Linux only to provide us a background from which to run some
application directly from CD.</p><p>Let me provide a concrete example. Suppose you keep your
favorite audio/video files on CD in several formats, such as DivX,
XviD, MP3, OggVorbis and so on. Typically, when you try to play
your files on a PC different from your own, one of the following
happens: the machine has no HD; no player on that machine is able
to play your audio/video format; the codec you need is not
installed; or everything is there, but the playback quality is poor
even though you know with the hardware playback should be pretty
decent.</p><p>Now, suppose that together with your files you also burned on
the CD a minimal Linux system that is able to boot directly from
CD. It would start automatically and play all of the CD files. This
way the CD would be &ldquo;self-sufficient&rdquo;, you wouldn't have to worry
about any codec hassle, and you could be pretty sure that all PC
resources are devoted only to the playback. Actually, you even
would be able to play your files on a diskless PC. And, of course,
you could still play all CD files from your favorite OS when you
want to do so.</p><p>As you might imagine, such a philosophy is not limited to
audio/video playback. You can create dedicated Linux
mini-distributions for basically any application, including gaming,
text processing, multimedia editing, network broadcasting and so
on.</p><p>Let me point out the main advantages of such
mini-distributions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No wasted HD space.</p></li><li><p>Ready to run every time you need it.</p></li><li><p>Runs even on a diskless PC.</p></li><li><p>Runs even where Linux is not present, helping Linux
diffusion.</p></li></ul></div><p>This idea of &ldquo;live&rdquo; CD distributions is not new. Many good
examples of both big (DemoLinux, Knoppix) and small (LNX-BBC,
Devil-Linux) distributions are available, especially those that are
routering and firewalling oriented. But, I could find very few
examples of such dedicated ones (see Resources).</p><p>In particular, a few months ago I looked on the Net for a
Linux CD mini-distribution that is able to boot and play
automatically all audio/video files on the CD. I was very surprised
to find none. Therefore, my only chance to get one was to develop
it myself, and so I started working on MoviX. Now, I am not a Linux
guru and I know close to zero about multimedia playback, but the
beauty of open source is you can put together tools developed by
people who know much more than you and still create something new
and useful. I put together my knowledge of Slackware management
(I've been fond of Slackware since 1994) and the MPlayer (&ldquo;the&rdquo;
multimedia player) and IsoLinux (an easy-to-use Linux CD
bootloader) package I had recently found out on the Net and began
building my distribution.</p><p>Initially MoviX consisted in a single Linux CD
micro-distribution, but after a lot of feedback and requests from
MoviX users, the project split into three different packages, as
follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>eMoviX</b></span>: a CD Linux
micro-distribution (~7MB) meant to be embedded in a CD together
with audio/video files that is able to boot and play automatically
all CD files.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>MoviX</b></span>: a CD Linux
mini-distribution (~15MB) able to boot and launch a console
interface to MPlayer.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>MoviX2</b></span>: a Linux
mini-distribution (~30MB) containing a full installation of XFree86
4.2.0 and able to boot and launch gmplayer, the MPlayer GUI.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you use MoviX or MoviX2, after the boot you can get rid of
the boot CD and use the interface to play most audio/video CD/DVDs.
In short, while eMoviX makes your CD self-sufficient, MoviX and
MoviX2 are some kind of &ldquo;Swiss Army Knife of multimedia&rdquo;, able to
make any PC a powerful multimedia station. And because MPlayer is
such a good piece of software, you can achieve good playback even
on a P200MMX.</p><p>The point I want to make in this article is that developing
this kind of dedicated mini-distributions is not hard once you have
a few guidelines. I hope to encourage the development of more such
distributions by describing below the main steps I followed to
build the MoviX packages. The only thing I assume is you are
accustomed to kernel/modules configuration and compilation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x1db3d40"></a>Compiling the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>First of all, make sure your kernel is compiled with support
for the RAM disk and loopback device, because you are going to use
these features. It is cleaner to keep your PC kernel tree separated
from the one used for the distribution. So get the latest stable
kernel (2.4.20 at the time of this writing), and unpack it in a
directory different from your main kernel directory.</p><p>The kernel configuration defaults are close to the ones we
need. Once you are in the distribution kernel directory, run
<b  >make menuconfig</b> and add support for the
following items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Code maturity level options ---&gt; Prompt for
development and/or incomplete code/drivers</p></li><li><p>Processor type and features ---&gt; Processor
family: [choose Pentium-MMX]</p></li><li><p>Block device ---&gt; Loopback device support</p></li><li><p>Block device ---&gt; RAM disk support</p></li><li><p>Block device ---&gt; Initial RAM disk (initrd)
support</p></li><li><p>File systems ---&gt; /dev file system support
[select the &ldquo;Automatically mount at boot&rdquo; option]</p></li></ul></div><p>Then run <b  >make bzImage</b> to produce the
kernel binary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x1db4420"></a>Creating the Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>The initrd file (init Ram Disc) contains the root filesystem
of the distribution. Our first initrd should contain only the
system files; therefore, 5MB will be enough. To create it, we make
use of the RAM discs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=5000
mke2fs -m0 /dev/ram0 5000
mount /dev/ram0 /distro
</pre><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> standard for small
distributions is the Busybox binary (the &ldquo;Swiss Army Knife of
Embedded Linux&rdquo;) in place of the scores of small binaries we
need.</p><p>Compilation instructions are pretty easy and well documented,
but you also may want to take a look at Bruce Perens' Busybox
articles in <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> (see
Resources). I suggest you compile it with support for all possible
commands because, eventually, you are going to need most of them.
Remember to install Busybox with <b  >./install.sh
/distro</b>, so all links for all commands supported by your
copy of Busybox automatically are created in /distro.</p><p>Binaries usually are linked dynamically to system libraries.
It is possible to compile Busybox statically to save space. But, we
are going to add more complex binaries to the distribution, so
eventually we'll have to add dynamical libraries anyway. To add the
libraries for a binary, say Busybox, the rule is always the
same:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>get the list of libraries linked to it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
root# ldd busybox
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40028000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>copy all of them ton /distro/lib/.</p></li></ul></div><p>A trick to minimize libraries size is getting rid of all the
debug stuff they contain:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
objcopy --strip-debug /lib/libc.so.6 /distro/lib/libc.so.6
</pre><p>To complete the work we need to add a few configuration
scripts: <a href="6474l4.html" target="_self">/distro/etc/inittab</a>,
<a href="6474l5.html" target="_self">/distro/etc/rc.d/rc.S</a>,
<a href="6474l6.html" target="_self">/distro/etc/fstab</a>,
<a href="6474l7.html" target="_self">/distro/etc/shells</a> and
<a href="6474l8.html" target="_self">/distro/etc/profile</a>. We also need
to create a few directories: /distro/dev, /distro/mnt, distro/proc,
/distro/root and /distro/tmp. We don't need to create any device
node in /distro/dev, because the devfs d&aelig;mon automatically
creates all devices at boot time.</p><p>Finally we can create the initrd file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
umount /dev/ram0
dd if=/dev/ram0 of=initrd bs=1k count=5000
</pre><p>To check that everything is okay, you can mount the initrd
file and take a look inside:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount initrd /distro -o loop
ls -lR /distro
</pre><p>Then remember to umount it and gzip it.</p><p>Before burning a CD, it is a good idea to test the initrd
image by booting it from LILO. Create an /initrd directory in your
system, put bzImage and initrd.gz there, rename bzImage as vmlinuz
and add the lines in Listing 1 to lilo.conf.</p><p><a href="6474l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Adding a LILO
Entry</a></p><p>At this point run LILO, reboot and choose the &ldquo;Distro&rdquo; label
at the LILO prompt to boot with your new distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21ad1c8"></a>Making the CD</h2></div></div><p>To create a bootable CD containing the kernel and filesystem
created above, you need a boot image. The most convenient choice
you can make is the IsoLinux boot image, called isolinux.bin and
part of the SysLinux package, so your system is able to load the
initrd.gz no matter what its size.</p><p>Begin by creating a new directory, say /cdrom. Then, create a
/cdrom/isolinux/kernel directory; put the initrd.gz and
isolinux.bin files in /isolinux and the kernel in isolinux/kernel.
Finally, inside /isolinux edit a isolinux.cfg file to tell the boot
loader the boot options you want to use (see Listing 2).</p><p><a href="6474l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Simple isolinux.cfg
File</a></p><p>The format of this file is similar to the lilo.conf format;
consult the SysLinux web site for detailed information. A nice
improvement is the possibility of calling up to 10 text files from
the boot prompt, using the F1-F10 keys. That is, there is a way to
make the user able to access documentation about boot parameters
right at boot time, directly from the CD. For the type of
distribution we are talking about, this is a useful feature.
Another nice feature is the capability to visualize pictures rather
than text, for example, making it possible to add a &ldquo;splash&rdquo; boot
logo to the distribution (16 colors at most; otherwise, try the
BootScriptor package).</p><p>To produce a bootable CD image, run mkisofs with the
following options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkisofs -o /tmp/distro.iso -r -V "My distro" -v -no-emul-boot \
  -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -b isolinux/isolinux.bin \
  -c isolinux/isolinux.boot /cdrom
</pre><p>Then, burn the image:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord dev=0,0 -v -eject /tmp/distro.iso
</pre><p>Now you can reboot the system to be sure the burning was
successful and the CD is really bootable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21ad5e8"></a>Detecting Hardware</h2></div></div><p>As is, this CD already is a pretty good hardware checking
tool, and it easily can be turned into a good recovery tool.
Indeed, simply by booting from it, you can find out the brand and
model of most PC hardware (everything except ISA cards) by looking
at /proc/pci and /proc/cpuinfo. By taking a look at the kernel boot
log with dmesg, you also may find information on the P&amp;P ISA
cards. Adding to it binaries such as e2fsck, you have all the tools
necessary to recovery a Linux system experiencing problems.</p><p>On the other hand, no card is supported by the system at this
point&mdash;no NIC, no audio card, no SCSI card, nothing. Although this
probably is okay for a rescue CD, it most likely is not okay for
our mini-distribution.</p><p>The standard way of activating kernel hardware support is to
use kernel modules, but simply loading all possible modules is not
a good idea. You need some autodetection tool. Several
autodetection tools have been developed by big Linux distributions:
kudzu (Red Hat), libdetect (Mandrake, but now they use kudzu too),
discover (Progeny). But these seem much too complex for the kind of
small distribution we are building.</p><p>Luckily, you can base a simple autodetection procedure on the
devfs. Indeed, its automatic creation of device nodes can be used
as an effective way of checking whether some device has been
recognized by the kernel. For example, the device node
/dev/sound/dsp automatically is created only when you load the
right module for your audio card. So, you can easily write a script
that loads, one by one, every single audio module and verifies
every time whether the audio device appeared. If it did, then you
successfully loaded the driver and can stop the loop; otherwise,
you can unload the module and go on. See Listing 3 for a simple
Perl example.</p><p><a href="6474l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Loading Audio Card Module
with Perl</a></p><p>Hence, our method of autodetecting some kind of card, say the
audio one, follows this path:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>go back to the distribution kernel directory and
activate the support for all possible audio cards as
modules;</p></li><li><p>compile all modules with <b  >make
modules</b></p></li><li><p>install the modules on your system with
<b  >make modules_install</b> (to avoid overwriting the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; modules directory, make sure you rename it before installing
the distribution's);</p></li><li><p>re-mount the initrd.gz file on /distro (remember to
gunzip it before mounting it or it won't work);</p></li><li><p>copy the newly created directory
/lib/modules/2.4.20 to /distro/lib/modules/; if the space left is
smaller than ~.5MB, build a new initrd, as explained above, and
assign to it more space;</p></li><li><p>add some script to load all possible modules and
add a line to call it in rc.S</p></li></ul></div><p>I don't have enough data to tell you whether this method is
always reliable, but I've been using it in all MoviX packages for
four months. Thus far, I have received no negative feedback, so at
least I can tell you it is not totally unreliable.</p><p>Repeating this procedure for every kind of driver you need,
you can easily build a script able to autodetect all hardware
supported by Linux on any PC. You can find working examples of such
scripts in each MoviX package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21aded8"></a>Adding Your Application</h2></div></div><p>Once all necessary hardware drivers are loaded, any
application making use only of the console can be installed easily
in the distribution. Both eMoviX and MoviX are based exactly on
this principle, because the package MPlayer is able to play audio
and video files without X.</p><p>If we assume, as it happens in most of cases, the package we
want to include in our distribution makes use of the
autoconf/automake mechanism, then the easiest way to add the
package is to do something like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mplayer [further options]
make
make install
</pre><p>In this case, to transfer the installation to the
distribution it is enough to do as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>re-mount the inird in /distro</p></li><li><p>copy the package in /distro: <b  >cp -a
/usr/local/mplayer/ /distro/usr/local/</b></p></li><li><p>add to /distro/lib/ all missing libraries linked to
all binaries in /usr/local/mplayer/bin/;</p></li><li><p>add the /usr/local/mplayer/bin/ path to the PATH
variable in profile: PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mplayer/bin/</p></li><li><p>add a line to rc.S to create a software link in the
distro /lib to all libraries in /usr/local/mplayer/lib/ with
<b  >ln -s /usr/local/mplayer/lib/*
/distro/lib/</b></p></li><li><p>unmount and gzip back the initrd.</p></li></ul></div><p>Following these directions for the application mp3blaster,
you easily could produce a mini-distribution able to boot and play
automatically every MP3 or Ogg Vorbis audio file&mdash;a distribution
endowed with a nice console interface (the native mp3blaster one).
This would ensure that users are able to play their favorite Vorbis
files on any PC (at least as long as its audio card is supported by
Linux), regardless of which OS is installed and without having to
install any plugin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21ae668"></a>Dealing with X</h2></div></div><p>A lot of applications need X in order to work. Unfortunately,
the XFree package tends to be pretty big (~80MB), which is bad when
you need to load everything in RAM to make the CD/DVD drive back
available.</p><p>Several projects are available whose goal or byproduct is
small-sized versions of X, including DirectFB or smallX, but none
of them gets close to the hardware support level offered by the
latest XFree86 full versions. If you plan to make use of such
capabilities for the largest number of cards possible, the best
solution is to use the full XFree86 package after removing as many
unnecessary component as possible.</p><p>Luckily enough, almost half of the XFree86 package is
occupied by fonts. As the distribution you are building is going to
run only a few applications, you easily can reduce the package size
to around 40MB once you identify the few fonts actually used.
Getting rid of unnecessary binaries and libraries can bring the
package size down to around 30MB.</p><p>Of course, you also need to produce a working XF86Config file
&ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;, either generating it from X itself&mdash;using the X
-configure command and tweaking it a little (you need at least to
set the number of colors and your favorite screen resolution)--or
creating a sort of template. In the template method, you would
write a script that is able to detect the video card and then set
the right parameters corresponding to it.</p><p>In both cases it is a good idea to have a tool able to detect
the most important data of the monitor, namely the horizontal sync
and the vertical refresh frequencies ranges. It is especially
helpful if it warn us when the monitor is not able to provide this
data, so we can provide standard frequencies instead. A good tool
for this is the program ddcxinfo, part of the kudzu package, that
returns the ranges we need with <b  >ddcxinfo -hsync</b>
and <b  >ddcxinfo -vsync</b>, respectively. When the
information is not available, it simply returns 0-0.</p><p>Finally, let me point out that you most likely won't need a
window manager, because you are going to run only one application.
This is the case for MoviX2. In case you need one, you should try a
tiny manager, such as Matchbox.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21ae9d8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I hope this article helps increase the number of such
dedicated distributions. Their development does not require highly
technical skills, only a good acquaintance with the management of a
Linux system. Moreover, it is an effective way to increase
significantly your knowledge of Linux and the application you're
including, thanks to the users feedback.</p><p>Let me conclude by thanking all developers whose projects I
used for making them open source, because the MoviX project would
not have been possible otherwise. Thank you also to all the people
whose feedback significantly increased my knowledge of Linux and
MPlayer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbb580.0x21aeb38"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>MoviX:
