    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x1304138"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you're thinking about getting involved
in e-commerce, you'd best be aware that you've missed your chance.
Thanks to a 1996 U.S. Federal appeals court decision
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust vs. Signature Financial
Group</em></span>), it's now possible to obtain broadly phrased
patents on Internet business processes. These patents enable a firm
to obtain what amounts to a government-guaranteed monopoly on the
abstract concept of how to carry out a certain type of business on
the Internet. Since then, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO) has awarded hundreds of patents for e-commerce business
processes, including Amazon's patent on its one-click ordering
technology. As the Amazon case illustrates, businesses that obtain
such patents will not hesitate to use them against competitors&mdash;and
Amazon would just love to get rid of that pesky upstart, Barnes
&amp; Noble, which wasn't quite as quick to realize the potential
of selling books on the Internet. Within the next few months, savvy
patent seekers are sure to win patents on every conceivable method
of doing business by e-commerce. If you're not aware of such
patents, and start making some money, you'll hear from their
lawyers. Count on it.</p><p>Defenders of the U.S. patent system concede that some recent
patents seem too broadly phrased. They point out that the courts
may overturn some of the recently granted Internet patents. Of
course, that's no consolation to those who may have to give up
their businesses rather than face insolvency in prolonged patent
litigation; the cost of contesting a patent infringement generally
exceeds $500,000. But you should be aware of an even more chilling
possibility: namely, that the courts may very well sustain such
patents. That is precisely the conclusion reached by legal scholar
Francisc Keeley-Domokos (1999), and other prominent legal scholars
concur (Melges 1999). After tracing the long, tortuous line of
legal reasoning that led the Federal Court to the State Street
decision, these scholars conclude that the Court's reasoning was
sound&mdash;and that many, if not most, Internet patents will withstand
a court challenge.</p><p>How could sound legal reasoning lead to a patent policy that
so obviously undermines competition, discourages innovation, and
distorts market dynamics in an important, emerging industry? As
you'll learn in this essay, you don't get the answer until you
trace this reasoning back to the earliest decision that enabled
patent seekers to win government-guaranteed monopolies for software
algorithms&mdash;that is, the first U.S. Supreme Court decision
concerning computer software (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gottschalk vs.
Benson</em></span>, 1972). In this decision, the computer-illiterate
judges committed an error of monumental proportion in defining one
of the basic concepts of computer science, the algorithm. Their
error led directly to the lower court decisions and PTO policies
that transformed virtually all software algorithms into patentable
subject property&mdash;and in the end, as you'll see, to the concept of
patents on abstract Internet business patents.</p><p>Legal scholars will say that the long chain of legal
reasoning since the 1972 Benson decision is too well-established to
be overturned. But this is tantamount to saying that, if the U.S.
Supreme Court once ruled that the earth is flat, then all
subsequent courts must proceed as if this is true. In the end, I
believe Internet patents can be successfully challenged only by
laying bare the erroneous thinking that underlies the very concept
of software patents. Please read on; everyone who understands
essential computer concepts bears an important responsibility to
educate the public, as well as our lawmakers, about what's truly at
stake. If you're reading this from outside the U.S., please be
aware that these patents can be written so that the U.S. can compel
foreign countries to honor them. That's true even if your country's
laws haven't yet been fully molded in the image of the
out-of-control U.S. intellectual property system. The points I'm
about to make matter to everyone, everywhere, who's concerned in
any way about the future of computing and electronic
commerce.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x13043f8"></a>Patents in Constitutional Perspective</h2></div></div><p>Let's start with a bit of background. As you're probably
aware, the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress &ldquo;to promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times
to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective
Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo; But what does this mean?</p><p>Judges and attorneys who favor software patents will argue
that a literal reading of the Constitution discloses only that such
rights should be limited in duration, but this is obviously false.
The Constitution clearly states that that copyrights and patents
should promote the progress of science and technology. It is also
obvious that the Constitution means to distinguish intellectual
property rights from the type of rights granted to owners of
tangible property, such as real estate. In the &ldquo;takings&rdquo; clause,
the Constitution plainly states that the government may not deprive
citizens of their tangible property without paying fair
compensation. However, no such compensation is owed when copyright
and patent holders lose their protection. Therefore, the
Constitution argues that Congress promotes science and technology
not only by <span   class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> temporary monopolies to
copyright and patent holders, but also by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>depriving</em></span> them of these rights after a certain
amount of time has expired. What the Constitution envisions, in
short, is a thriving and growing public domain of ideas, knowledge,
and techniques. In the public domain, no one person has a right to
exclude others from using ideas, information, techniques, or
knowledge in a particular way (Benkler 1999).</p><p>From the writings of the Framers and the earliest patent and
copyright laws, as well as two centuries of jurisprudence, it is
clear that the Constitution does not offer protection for &ldquo;anything
under the sun made by man&rdquo;, as a more recent (and misguided)
Congressional committee put it. Authors and inventors cannot seek
protection for ideas, scientific truths, abstract concepts, and the
mental steps that are the stock in trade of expertise in science
and technology. These must always be part of the public domain. If
intellectual property rights are expanded to the point that they
reduce rather than enlarge the public domain, then they fail to
measure up to the expressed constitutional standard, i.e.,
promoting the progress of science and technology. How effective
would your college education have been if your professors had to
pay licensing fees every time they taught you a fact or a
mathematical formula?</p><p>Copyright law serves the constitutional purpose admirably. As
you may be aware, copyright protects only the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>expression</em></span> of an idea, not the idea itself.
But patents are risky. A patent seeker may try to win a patent, not
only on the practical implementation of an idea but also the idea
itself. This is precisely what telegraph inventor Samuel Morse
tried to do in 1853. After winning seven patents on
telegraph-related devices, Morse sought an eighth patent on the
abstract concept of using electromagnetism to produce printed
characters at a distance. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to award
the eighth patent to Morse, pointing out that it amounted to a
patent on an abstract concept&mdash;that of electromagnetism. Such a
patent could not serve to promote science and technology. It would
do the opposite, because it would enable Morse to levy what amounts
to a tax on any new method of electromagnetism for communication
purposes. An inappropriately broad patent, in sum, fails to promote
science and technology because it enables the patent holder to
eliminate competitors who may very well have come up with better
technology. For the same reasons, the courts have long refused to
grant patents on abstract business concepts, such as a certain type
of accounting system that is required in order to do business in a
specific field. Such a patent is inimical to the public good
because it enables the patent holder, in effect, to win a monopoly
on a specific type of business.</p><p>In short, what <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> patentable is not the
idea itself, but rather the practical application of an idea in a
genuinely innovative way. As the U.S. Supreme Court has recently
affirmed, Congress and the Patent Office may not enable patent
seekers to obtain patents that, in effect, remove existing
knowledge from the public domain. Such knowledge includes the
truths of science, which are given by nature and, as such, cannot
be discovered. An inventor may claim to have made a considerable
investment in research that disclosed a new scientific truth, and
seek to win patent protection for the truth itself, not just the
practical application of this truth. But such actions would impede
the progress of science. For this reason, the U.S. courts have long
held that scientific truths, even if newly encountered, must be
treated as if they are, in principle, prior art, and therefore not
subject to patent protection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x13047c0"></a>The Benson Blunder</h2></div></div><p>Still with me? OK, you're about to find out how we got into
this mess. Let's start with patent attorney Giles S. Rich, who in
1952 chaired a congressional commission that rewrote the Patent
Act.</p><p>The Patent Act's language, dating back to 1790, enumerated
patentable subject matter in the following terms: &ldquo;any new or
useful art, machine, manufacture, or process of nature&rdquo;. In place
of &ldquo;art&rdquo;, the Giles-led commission recommended that Congress use
the word &ldquo;process&rdquo; instead. This was no insignificant updating. The
history of technology reveals that the term &ldquo;art&rdquo; nicely captures
the Constitution's intent in that, in this context, it refers to
the non-scientific skills and techniques that a successful
practitioner uses. In contrast, &ldquo;process&rdquo; could include scientific
processes, such as those employed in industry. It seems reasonable
enough to extend patent protection to industrial processes, but you
shouldn't be na&iuml;ve about Giles' intentions. In the early
1950s, Giles embarked on a single-minded, decades-long campaign to
greatly expand the scope of patent protection to &ldquo;anything under
the sun made by man&rdquo;, as the Giles-led commission put it.
Subsequently, Giles fought for the legislation and jurisprudence
that enable biotechnology firms to win patent protections for
engineered life forms.</p><p>Enter computer software&mdash;and a great deal of confusion. In a
computer program presented for patent protection, it is far from
obvious (especially to those new to computing) just how to separate
the abstract concepts from their practical application. In the 1972
Benson decision, the computer-illiterate judges tried to deal with
a program that converted decimal numbers into binary numbers. Doing
its job as charged, the Court attempted to determine whether the
patent seeker was attempting to win a patent, not only on the
specific application of the underlying idea, but on the idea
itself. In its analysis, the Court determined that the underlying
idea was the program's algorithm, which it defined as &ldquo;a procedure
for solving a mathematical problem&rdquo;. The Court rejected the patent,
pointing out that granting patent protection to this &ldquo;mathematical
algorithm&rdquo; would be tantamount to granting a state-guaranteed
monopoly on a scientific truth. Scientific truths are not subject
to patent protection, the Court affirmed.</p><p>The Benson decision paved the way for the patentability of
virtually all software algorithms. Almost immediately, the lower
courts (and subsequently, the Patent Office) interpreted the Benson
decision to mean that only &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>mathematical</em></span>
algorithms&rdquo;, those that solve an equation for numerical purposes,
are excluded from patentability. All other algorithms became
subject to patent protection, even if they appeared to use
mathematics. The key determining factor in an algorithm's
patentability, the lower courts concluded, was whether the
algorithm was intended to perform a numerical computation rather
than control or supervise a practical process. In the end, the
courts' reasoning led them to embrace patents for most mathematical
algorithms as well, excepting only those with no known practical
application, such as (presumably) an artificial life
simulation.</p><p>What's wrong with the Benson decision is immediately obvious
to anyone with a modicum of computer literacy. As Turing proved in
1937, there is no defensible boundary that separates
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mathematical</em></span> from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non-mathematical</em></span> algorithms. On the contrary,
any mathematical or logical problem that is capable of solution can
be solved by a simple symbolic processor, which is capable of only
a few basic operations, such as advancing and retracting a strip of
paper and making or erasing marks on this paper. In short, there is
no boundary that clearly separates mathematical from
non-mathematical algorithms, such that the mathematical algorithms
constitute a program developer's stock in trade of abstract
concepts. On the contrary, the programmer's stock in trade consists
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>algorithms</em></span>, most of which are used for
purposes other than solving equations. For example, when you study
programming, you examine a whole series of algorithms that perform
tasks such as sorting and searching. Properly defined, an algorithm
is a step-by-step procedure for solving a specified problem.
Whether the problem is mathematical in nature or not has nothing to
do with the level of abstraction involved.</p><p>To restrict the abstract conceptual knowledge of programmers
and software engineers to mathematical algorithms is not only
theoretically indefensible, but flies in the face of everyday
professional practice. When you develop a program, you move from a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>functional specification</em></span>, a statement of what
the program is supposed to do, to a <span   class="emphasis"><em>structural
specification</em></span>, a statement of how a particular
algorithm, independent of any specific programming language, should
be employed in the program's design. To accomplish this,
programmers use paper-and-pencil techniques such as pseudo-code or
flow charts, or programs that emulate these paper-and-pencil
techniques.</p><p>Here's the key point. By restricting the abstract concepts of
program development to a non-existent class of &ldquo;mathematical
algorithms&rdquo;, the Benson decision enabled patent seekers, in effect,
to win patents on the conceptual knowledge and mental steps that
programmers use to create software. I'll return to this point in a
bit, but first let's look at how the Court's reasoning in Benson
led to Internet patents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x1304ce8"></a>The So-Called &ldquo;Separation of Powers&rdquo; in Action:
Rich Gets His Way</h2></div></div><p>Dystopian novelist George Orwell liked to point out that, in
the future, the government will twist and distort the meaning of
words in order to enslave the citizenry. If you think he was nuts,
read on.</p><p>Here's how we got to State Street, folks. The basic
reasoning:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>According to the 1952 Patent Act, step-by-step
industrial processes, such as those used in making synthetic
rubber, are patentable subject matter.</p></li><li><p>Software algorithms are step-by-step procedures for
accomplishing a practical purpose.</p></li><li><p>There is no real difference between a step-by-step
industrial process and a software algorithm. Both are step-by-step
procedures for accomplishing a practical purpose. Both are
algorithms.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, software algorithms are processes, and
processes are subject to patent protection.</p></li><li><p>Oh, by the way, let's get rid of that old
prohibition on business processes, to the extent that they involve
computers. When implemented by means of a software algorithm, a
business process is a step-by-step method for solving a problem. If
computer processes can be patented, then business processes can be
patented, as long as they involve computers.</p></li></ol></div><p>Incidentally, the judge who wrote for the State Street
majority was none other than our old friend Giles S. Rich, then in
his nineties. Rich survived long enough to interpret the very
language that he himself had injected into U.S. patent law, namely,
the substitution of &ldquo;process&rdquo; for the former word &ldquo;art&rdquo;. He died in
June, 1999. The rest of us are stuck with the mess.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x1305268"></a>Abolish Software Patents Now</h2></div></div><p>You can protest Internet patents until you're blue in the
face, and boycott all you like, but you're wasting your time. The
court's reasoning in the State Street decision is sound, if you
accept the definition of &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; laid down by the Benson
decision. It's quite likely that the courts will affirm Internet
patents. We're not going to get rid of Internet patents until the
computer profession exposes the profound error that underlies this
whole dysfunctional tradition of jurisprudence. That means getting
rid of software patents, too.</p><p>Defenders of Internet and software patents will argue that
strong intellectual property protection is needed for economic
advancement. In this, they are correct, but they're leaving
something out. Strong science is needed, too. In their boundless
greed, some patent seekers will try to lock up the abstract
concepts, mental processes, and scientific truths used by
practitioners so that they can effectively monopolize a certain way
of doing business. This is precisely what Amazon has achieved in
its patent on one-click technology. The company defends its patent
by stating that it spent thousands of hours developing the
one-click method, which boils down to the use of garden-variety web
programming to retain customer information from session to session.
But all e-commerce sites spend thousands of hours developing their
pages, and all e-commerce sites use cookies to retain customer
information. What Amazon has obtained is a patent on the conceptual
knowledge and mental processes that Web developers employ every day
to create e-commerce sites.</p><p>Amazon's patent could be contested by looking for evidence of
prior art, which would invalidate the company's patent claim; but
such a solution is piecemeal. It does not address the underlying
problem, which is essentially this: in obtaining patents on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> software algorithm, patent seekers are
succeeding, in effect, in obtaining a monopoly on the mental
processes and abstract concepts routinely employed by software
developers. Our attack on the patentability of software algorithms
should begin at this level and proceed in accordance with the First
Amendment. The U.S. Constitution guarantees not only freedom of
speech, but also freedom of thought. By obtaining broadly phrased
patents that restrain others from using the stock-in-trade mental
steps and concepts used to develop web sites, Internet patent
holders are violating the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
software developers to engage in the thought processes
characteristic of their profession.</p><p>Internet patent holders will reply that their algorithms are
novel, and therefore deserve protection. They are, after all,
easily copied by others. This argument must be refuted as well, and
once again, Turing points the way. His 1937 paper proves that
algorithms, like the laws of physics, are timeless, immutable
truths given by nature. <span   class="emphasis"><em>If this were not the case,
Turing's equations could not have shown that a certain class of
problems exists which algorithms (and by extension, computers) will
never be able to solve.</em></span> Turing was able to project the
science of algorithms forward to the point at which he could
discern its ultimate limitations, just as Einstein was able to
discern, thanks to his equations, that it is not possible to travel
faster than the speed of light. Neither prediction could have been
made unless both were dealing with the underlying truths of nature.
Either you see this, or you don't; and if you don't, go back to
college.</p><p>As two centuries of U.S. jurisprudence establish beyond
question, the truths of nature cannot be subject to patent
protection. Any such truth that is discovered in the process of
technological development should be regarded, therefore, as if it
were prior art. In short, there's a better way to combat Internet
patents than chasing after old journals and Internet posts in
search of prior art. Because algorithms are part of the truths
given by nature, all algorithms, even novel ones, are prior art
<span   class="emphasis"><em>by definition</em></span>. It therefore follows that there
is no such thing as a valid patent on a software algorithm,
including one for which no evidence of previous practice can be
found to exist.</p><p>Internet patent holders will further argue that patents are
needed to compensate those who try to discover new algorithms. This
is the most absurd argument of all&mdash;and it is deeply offensive, as
well, coming as it does from companies that may very well have
accomplished little more than blending an existing business
practice with the level of web publishing knowledge found in an
introductory textbook. Most of the algorithms now in existence were
invented before they became eligible for patent protection. Patent
protections were not needed then. They are not needed now. There is
no evidence that withdrawing patent protection for software
algorithms would discourage further scientific progress in this
area.</p><p>The whole lengthy, dysfunctional, Orwellian edifice of legal
reasoning that supports Internet patents has a huge central flaw.
It rests, ultimately, on a monumental misunderstanding of the
science of algorithms (Newell 1986). The computing community must
explain this to the public and lawmakers. And we must speak with a
unified voice: Abolish software patents, and abolish them
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x120c580.0x13056e0"></a>References and Selected Readings</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Andrews, Edmund L.
