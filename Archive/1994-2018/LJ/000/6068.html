    An easy and fast installation, streamlined admin tools and
    meticulous data accountability&mdash;this is backup software?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de6298"></a></h2></div></div><p>I still am a kid at heart when it comes
to gadgets and software. Whenever I get a new one I'm always
incredibly eager to fire it up. But that was not the case when I
received <a href="http://www.tolisgroup.com" target="_self">BRU-Pro
2.0</a>. I was expecting to have to install it, spend a while
recompiling my kernel with some arcane options, spend some time
figuring out why it wasn't finding my tape drive and then spend
more time debugging something else. At least, that's how things
have worked for me with other backup solutions. Why would this one
be any different? I grabbed my bottle of Advil and hunkered down
for what I expected to be a long and tedious afternoon.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I was backing up and throwing the Advil
back into the drawer. Jokes aside, BRU-Pro's installation was the
simplest installation of any backup product I've ever seen. Quite
literally, I mounted the cd-rom, ran
<b  >./install.sh</b>, said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to install, and after a
few more simple prompts, I was done. The manual (and it should be
noted that I received a rough-draft manual prior to it going to the
printer) covered every possible problem you might have during the
installation problem, from noexec flags to a missing package
dependency. Not only did the installation program install
everything flawlessly, it even configured (quite transparently) my
drive into the system and installed the first client onto the
server. My only complaint about the installation process was that
it was probably more verbose than it had to be at times, but it
seems like a very small price to pay for the world's easiest
install.</p><p>The administrative interface is intuitive and easy to use. A
simple logon screen prompts you for a password and then sends you
to a clean and easy to understand UI. With only six simple
tabs&mdash;Backup, Restore, Verify, Configure, Refresh and Exit, it
doesn't take long to learn the interface.</p><p>My first task was to back up something. I picked some files
from my system and hit Backup. The tape drive spun up and BRU
backed up my home directory to tape while displaying a simple
progress bar in a window. Restores were just as simple and offered
me a variety of options, such as restoring to a different machine
or directory, prompting in case of an overwrite and offering to
send a confirmation e-mail upon completion. It may seem like
BRU-Pro's interface is so simple that it lacks true backup
capabilities; this is not the case.</p><p>With BRU-Pro 2.0 you can push clients into various groups.
You could have, for example, a group for Windows clients or UNIX
clients. When setting up your backup schedule, you can select to
backup every disk of every machine or you can &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; into
each group and make specific selections, down to a specific file on
a specific machine. You also are not limited to one schedule per
group. You can mix and match schedules across groups and have
multiple schedules in each group. For example, say you had several
mail servers in a group called Mail. You could schedule BRU to
backup /var/mail every hour but / every night. You could even
&ldquo;batch&rdquo; schedules together so that one job's completion triggers
another schedule.</p><p>As with most backup systems, you can choose between different
backup levels. In BRU's case, you can choose from a full, Level 1
and Level 2 backup. Level 1 backs up all files that have changed
since the last full backup. Level 2 backs up all files that have
changed since the last Level 1 backup. It will auto promote backups
as well, so that if you attempt to do a Level 1 or Level 2 backup
the backup is promoted to a full one. In the simple to use
configuration screen, you can configure a variety of options such
as groups, schedules, devices and licenses. So, what does all this
cost?</p><p>BRU-Pro 2.0 Server with three client licenses (the base
package) for Linux x86, IA64 or PPC is $999. None of the three
licenses are consumed on the backup machine itself. After that,
additional licenses are volume priced. A single additional license
is $99, with $10 price breaks at the 10-24 mark and at the 25-50
mark. Unlike other solutions, BRU-Pro provides native SCSI support
of all tape devices in its base price, so there are no additional
costs to support specific tape devices like autoloaders or
libraries. Technical support is $499 for the initial product and
provides unlimited access to phone, e-mail and fax service. It also
does not limit support to any single individual within an
organization, which is a good thing. Support for additional clients
is volume priced and starts at under $25. It is hard to shake a
stick at prices like these.</p><p>BRU's biggest selling point, besides price, is down in the
dirt of how it does backups. The philosophy BRU's creators took was
that your backups are only as good as the data on them. It is easy
to assume that since you backed something up, your data is safe;
unfortunately, that is not always the case. Therefore, the creators
designed BRU to provide accountability for every bit of data of
every buffer block, local or remote. BRU applies a 32-bit CRC at
the buffer level and writes it to the header before it goes to
tape. The result is that every single little piece of data is
verifiable. The 32-bit CRC means that BRU uses 8-12% more tape than
other backup solutions, but you get a very robust backup solution.
It may not sound so fancy or special, but it is a cool
feature.</p><p>On top of that, if BRU does run into a bad chunk of data
during a recover, it will attempt to re-read it several times. If
it still cannot read the bad data, it will continue with the next
piece of data rather than bombing out. This means that a large text
file with some bad data in it would not be completely lost&mdash;BRU
would at least recover what it could. Trivial feature? Maybe, but I
could see it coming in very handy in some cases.</p><p>BRU-Pro can also write multiple simultaneous data streams to
multiple tape drives. Therefore, the data from any one client is
written contiguously on tape and is not &ldquo;interleaved&rdquo; across many
tapes or multiplexed across a single tape. Again, a feature like
that sounds obvious, but not all backup solutions do it. BRU also
writes its catalogs to tape and to disk for extra peace of mind. If
you think about all these little features built into BRU, you can
see that it is a meticulously built product.</p><p>So, what about the other side of the coin? BRU-Pro 2.0 does
not support Novell Netware clients (though you can mount a Netware
client and back it up that way), so if you need that feature be
warned. I also had some problems with the Windows client on 2000
and XP. Sometimes the client would crash, and occasionally backup
speeds would slow to a crawl for no apparent reason. BRU knows that
the 2000/XP Windows client has a few issues here and there, and
they are working to fix them. I also had a graphical error once or
twice, but they never caused my backups to fail, just put a glitch
on my screen. I suspect the problem was with my goofy window
manager rather than with BRU. I also would have liked a little more
information for reporting purposes. In addition, some of the more
arcane options (like being able to backup Netware mounts) lay
hidden in configuration files. It would be nice to be able to
change them in the graphical format.</p><p>A good rule of thumb, I think, for any new product, is to
wait a little while before adopting it. It gives the developers
time to discover new bugs or issues and send out patches.
Considering the copy I received was virtually the first boxed
version and performed as well as it did, I am convinced that by the
time this article posts, or soon after, BRU-Pro will be a stellar
product. In truth, it already is.</p><p>The Good</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Price is very reasonable compared to other
