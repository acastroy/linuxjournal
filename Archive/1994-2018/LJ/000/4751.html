    As any administrator knows, a successful network rollout begins and ends with security. No matter how much money is spent on a system with the latest and greatest hardware and software, the system can be rendered worthless if its security is compromised.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1744580.0x183c138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Unfortunately, keeping up with system
security can be tedious. Administrators must stay aware of updates
to software as well as the latest system compromise techniques. Due
to this difficult task, system security is often not maintained and
is lacking in many areas. This is illustrated by the increased
number of reports that entail system compromise. This dilemma
changed for me when I discovered the freeware tools offered by
Psionic Software, Inc. called PortSentry and Logcheck. Within
minutes, these tools can be installed and configured to improve
system security dramatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1744580.0x183c240"></a>The Anatomy of PortSentry</h2></div></div><p>Once a host is targeted by an attacker, a port scan is almost
always performed. The port scan is done to expose all services
available on the target host and to provide a starting point for
break-in attempts. PortSentry detects such scans by monitoring the
unused ports on the host. Upon a connection attempt to one of the
unused ports, PortSentry is alerted and has the ability to issue a
number of commands in response to the scan. The commands issued are
configured by the administrator within a configuration file.
Although any command may be used, the most helpful is one in which
the IP address of the attacker's host is essentially &ldquo;black holed&rdquo;
by issuing a routing command that denies all traffic from that
address. The violation and corresponding action taken by PortSentry
are recorded in the system log. Using another Psionic utility,
Logcheck, these security alerts are e-mailed to an administrator at
designated intervals. Thus, the host is now capable not only of
retaliating against a potential break-in attempt automatically, but
also of notifying the administrator of the occurrence.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1744580.0x183c348"></a>Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Installation and configuration of these freeware utilities is
simple and straightforward. They compile on most operating systems,
including Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD. The system used for the
following install is an x86-based web server using Red Hat Linux
7.0. The tools can be downloaded from Psionic's web site
(<a href="http://www.psionic.com/tools" target="_self">www.psionic.com/tools/</a>).</p><p>The latest version of the tarballs as of this writing are
Logcheck 1.1.1 and PortSentry 1.0. First, we will install and
configure PortSentry. Untar the archive and enter the
PortSentry-version directory. Read the README.install file for all
configuration options available, if desired. Type <b  >make
&lt;&lt;I&gt;systype</b>&gt; (where systype is one of: linux,
bsd, solaris, hpux, hpux-gcc, freebsd, openbsd, netbsd, bsdi, aix,
osf or generic). Then use <b  >make install</b>
(installation directory can be changed by editing the
Makefile).</p><p>Next, we will install Logcheck. First, untar the archive and
enter the Logcheck-version directory. Then read the INSTALL file
for all configuration options available, if desired. Type
<b  >make &lt;&lt;I&gt;systype</b>&gt; (where systype is
one of: linux, bsdos, freebsd, sun, generic, hpux or digital).
Lastly, type <b  >make install</b> (installation
directory can be changed by editing the Makefile).</p><p>We will now edit
/usr/local/psionic/portsentry/portsentry.conf file to enable route
drop. Find and uncomment the KILL_ROUTE option that corresponds to
your operating system. For our example, we will use the ipchains
utility found in the Linux kernel version 2.102+:</p><p><b  >KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/ipchains -I input -s $TARGET$ -j
DENY -l</b></p><p>This will drop all packets originating from an attacker's IP
address and log future connection attempts. Individual ports must
now be specified for monitoring within the configuration file.
Commonly used ports are already given and can simply be
uncommented, depending upon how secure the system needs to
be:</p><p><b  >TCP_PORTS="1,11,15,79,111,119,143,540,635,1080,1524,2000,5742,6667,
12345,12346,20034,31337,32771,32772,32773,32774,40421,49724,
54320"UDP_PORTS="1,7,9,69,161,162,513,635,640,641,700,32770,32771,
32772,32773,32774,31337,54321"</b></p><p>On our example Linux system, however, we will be using
PortSentry's advanced stealth scan detection mode, which will
automatically monitor ports not being used below 1024 by default.
This value can also be altered, but alteration is not recommended.
When using this advanced mode, ports can also be manually
excluded:</p><p><b  ># Default TCP ident and NetBIOS
serviceADVANCED_EXCLUDE_TCP="113,139"# Default UDP route (RIP),
NetBIOS, bootp
broadcasts.ADVANCED_EXCLUDE_UDP="520,138,137,67"</b></p><p>Once all services for our host have been started, PortSentry
can now be enabled. First, we start up the TCP port monitor
(leaving out the -atcp switch for non-Linux systems):</p><p><b  >/usr/local/psionic/portsentry/portsentry
-atcp</b></p><p>Tailing our system log will give the following output:</p><p><b  >Dec 1 14:23:20 hostname
portsentry[18821]:adminalert: Advanced Stealth scan detection
modeactivated. Ignored TCP port: 80Dec 4 14:23:20 hostname
portsentry[18821]:adminalert: PortSentry is now active and
listening.</b></p><p>A list of ignored TCP ports will be displayed, followed by
confirmation of PortSentry's activation. Then, if desired, we start
up the UDP port monitor (again, leaving out the -audp switch for
non-Linux systems):</p><p><b  >/usr/local/psionic/portsentry/portsentry
-audp</b></p><p>Tailing our system log once more will give the following
output:</p><p><b  >Dec 1 14:23:20 hostname
portsentry[18821]:adminalert: Advanced Stealth scan detection
modeactivated. Ignored UDP port: 137Dec 4 14:23:20 hostname
portsentry[18821]:adminalert: PortSentry is now active and
listening.</b></p><p>A list of ignored UDP ports will be displayed, followed by
confirmation of PortSentry's activation. The command(s) can be
placed within a startup script but should always be initialized
after all other services are active. In this example we will
include the above command line into /etc/rc.d/rc.local. All actions
taken by PortSentry will be recorded in the system log.</p><p>With PortSentry now running, we will configure Logcheck to
e-mail an administrator of any suspicious network activity
experienced by the host. Edit /usr/local/etc/logcheck.sh to include
the e-mail address of the administrator:</p><p><b  >"mailto:SYSADMIN=<i><tt>your_administrator@yourdomain.com</tt></i>"</b></p><p>Finally, place the Logcheck command into a cron script to
parse the system log at an interval best suited for your
operations. We will set our interval for this example at one hour.
Open the crontab for editing by typing <b  >crontab
-e</b>, and place the following line into the crontab:</p><p><b  >0 * * * * /usr/local/etc/logcheck.sh &gt; &gt;
/dev/null</b></p><p>The host is now configured to detect and react to intrusion
attempts and to notify the administrator of such attempts, all
fully automated (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4751_l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. An E-mailed Intrusion
Attempt Detected by PortSentry and Parsed by
Logcheck</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1744580.0x183d210"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Using this freeware from Psionic Software, Inc., system
security is no longer a chore. My systems have been using these
freeware security utilities for nine months, and they have
performed flawlessly. Upon our initial use of the utilities, I was
amazed to see how many intrusion attempts were made in a 24-hour
interval. The configuration is extremely comprehensive and allows
flexibility in constructing your own network security policies. I
have set up dozens of gateway/firewall systems for enterprises and
have incorporated these utilities within our standard installation.
Thanks to Psionic, administrators now have two more tools for
strong system security.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Anthony Cinelli</b></span> is the
