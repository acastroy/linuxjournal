    How to digitize analog video sources for storage and
    manipulation on a computer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf30580.0x1028240"></a></h2></div></div><p>In 1999 I purchased my first DVD player.
My wife and I had a small collection of VHS tapes containing videos
that we wanted to view using our new purchase. Furthermore, optical
media is very convenient and stable, and the idea of storing our
video collection on CD-R discs was very attractive to us. What
followed was a very indepth investigation that has flourished into
an interesting hobby. In this article, I cover how to digitize
analog video sources for storage and manipulation on a computer,
tools for editing video on a computer and some options for
publishing digital videos. One publishing option I present is
storage in the video CD (VCD) format, which is compatible with many
DVD players. All of these steps are performed using free
software.</p><p>I am a software developer, not a video producer, so please
bear with me as you read this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf30580.0x10283a0"></a>Digitization</h2></div></div><p>The first obstacle I encountered in my work to convert my
videos was how to digitize the analog VHS tapes. Because I wanted
to convert standard analog video tapes, IEEE 1394 (Apple calls this
interface FireWire; Sony calls it i.LINK), though extremely
powerful, defines a purely digital interface and would not suffice.
Instead, I decided to purchase a video capture card. Many vendors
produce these cards, which take standard analog video streams and
digitize them for storage or display on a computer. I bought
<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com" target="_self">Hauppauge</a> WinTV PCI
video capture card that works nicely with Linux for around $80 US.
Incidentally, the Linux driver framework for video capture cards is
named Video4Linux.</p><p>There are a few important considerations to make when
purchasing a video capture card, though they are becoming less
relevant as the speed of computers continues to increase. Because
capturing video from most analog sources must occur in real time,
writing raw video to disk requires a very fast hard drive. In my
experience, even a 10,000 RPM SCSI drive has difficulty storing raw
24-bit video with a resolution of 640 x 480 and a frame rate of
23.9 frames/second. Think about it: around 30 frames per second,
640 x 480 = 307,200 pixels per frame, and each pixel is 24 bits. In
order to store uncompressed video of this quality, a hard drive
needs to write 2.21 x 108 bits, or around 26MB every second!</p><p>Don't run out and buy an expensive high-speed disk array
quite yet&mdash;an alternative exists. Compressing the raw video before
writing it to disk shifts some work away from the hard disk.
Compression can be done either by a dedicated processor, shifting
work to video capture card compression hardware, or in software,
shifting work to the system's CPU. Since my system has two 1,000MHz
CPUs, my cheap Hauppauge card, which lacks compression hardware,
performs just fine. If your computer's CPU is a little slower, it
may make more sense to invest in a video capture card with hardware
compression capabilities and save a relatively expensive CPU
upgrade for later.</p><p>Capturing raw or losslessly compressed video is ideal for
editing purposes, but capturing using a carefully chosen lossy
technique such as MJPEG, which stores each frame using JPEG still
image compression, is a realistic compromise. JPEG compression can
be performed relatively quickly in software. In addition, many
hardware video compressors output MJPEG.</p><p>Even when compressing a video stream before writing it, hard
disk speed is important in digitizing video. It follows that the
filesystem used is a large factor in performance. I have
experimented with the ext2, ReiserFS and
<a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs" target="_self">XFS</a>
filesystems. My experience is that capturing video to an XFS
filesystem generally outperforms capturing to ext2- or
ReiserFS-formatted disks. XFS has the additional benefit over ext2
of being a journaling filesystem.</p><p>Andrew Morton's
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/schedlat.html" target="_self">low-latency
kernel patch</a> also seems to help the digitization process. I
find that with Andrew's patch I am able to perform minor tasks on
my computer while capturing video without losing too many
frames.</p><p>As I am from the United States, I am interested in using the
National Television System Committee analog video format (NTSC).
Many Europeans may be more interested in PAL, which has similar
properties. If you live elsewhere, a little research will reveal
the analog video format used in your region. My VHS tapes are
encoded using NTSC. NTSC has a range of acceptable resolutions and
frame rates; when capturing from a VHS source I generally capture
640 x 480 frames at a rate of 23.976 frames/second. Though VCDs,
being digital, don't have a video norm such as NTSC, DVD players
generally use the frame rate that a VCD contains to decide what
type of analog signal they will send to the television to which
they are connected. For example, if I encode VCDs at 25
frames/second, my DVD player outputs a PAL signal that looks
distorted on my NTSC television. If I encode the same video stream
at 23.976 frames/second, a valid NTSC frame rate, my DVD player
outputs an NTSC signal to my television.</p><p>Digital media streams found on a computer are generally
stored as a wrapping format containing one or more audio and video
tracks. Examples of wrapping formats are AVI and QuickTime.
QuickTime has the advantage of being well defined by Apple,
<a href="http://www.heroinewarrior.com/quicktime.php3" target="_self">supported
on Linux</a> and able to store video streams much larger than
4GB. Within the wrapping format, different compression techniques
such as MJPEG, OpenDivX, Ogg Vorbis and MPEG audio may be used.
These compression/decompression techniques are often called codecs.
Wrapping formats such as QuickTime also can contain
storage-intensive raw digital audio and video.</p><p>I have found that <span   class="bold"><b>streamer</b></span>,
part of the <a href="http://www.bytesex.org/xawtv" target="_self">xawtv
package</a>, performs the digitization task nicely. Using
streamer, my system can capture 640 x 480 video at a frame rate of
23.976 frames/second from my video capture card and compress it in
real time to an MJPEG encoded QuickTime before writing it to
disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf30580.0x1028978"></a>Editing Video</h2></div></div><p>Once I had digital video on my computer, editing it was the
next step. Broadcast 2000 (MandrakeSoft produces an RPM called
bcast-2000c) is a GPLed nonlinear video editor [see &ldquo;Movie Making
on a Linux Box?&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> January 2001 and &ldquo;NLE
Video Editors&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> February 2002]. With it,
one can manipulate audio and video tracks. A screenshot of
Broadcast 2000 may be seen in Figure 1.
<a href="http://www.suse.com/en/support/howto/broadcast2000" target="_self">SuSE
has a pretty good guide to Broadcast 2000</a>. Cinelerra, best
for users competent in compiling development-quality code, can be
found on
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_self">SourceForge</a> and is
the up and coming successor to Broadcast 2000. Both of these tools
work with the QuickTime output from xawtv.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5817f1.large.jpg"><img src="5817f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

time to encode them as VCDs. A little research revealed that VCDs
contain MPEG-1 video streams and MPEG-1 layer 2 audio streams. This
data, along with some simple directory information, is encoded onto
a CD. More information about the VCD format, also known as the
White Book specification, can be found at
<a href="http://www.cdpage.com/Compact_Disc_Books/whitebook.html" target="_self">www.cdpage.com/Compact_Disc_Books/whitebook.html</a>.</p><p>A package named
<a href="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net" target="_self">mjpegtools</a> does a
good job of transcoding an MJPEG encoded QuickTime file into an
MPEG-1 stream. Using
<a href="http://www.vcdimager.org" target="_self">vcdimager</a>, a VCD
image can be created from the resulting MPEG-1 stream. Finally, the
VCD image can be burned to CD-R media using
<a href="http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net" target="_self">cdrdao</a>. Here is
how I use these tools to create a VCD on my system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
streamer -r 23.976024 -s 640x480 -f jpeg -F stereo
        -i Composite1 -n ntsc -c /dev/v4l/video0
        -b 64 -o foo.mov -p 2 -t 00:45:00
</pre><p>You may need to use a different argument with -c, which
specifies the video capture device to use. Often it is /dev/video0.
The -t parameter specifies how long the program should continue
capturing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lav2yuv +n -n 2 -d 3 foo.mov | yuvscaler -n n
        -O VCD | mpeg2enc -n n -f 1 -r 16
        -o foo_video.mpg
lav2wav +n foo.mov | mp2enc -V -o foo_audio.mp2
mplex -f 1 foo_audio.mp2 foo_video.mpg -o foo.mpg
vcdimager foo.mpg
cdrdao write --driver generic-mmc --device <span   class="emphasis"><em>0,4,0</em></span>
--speed 1 videocd.cue
</pre><p>Replace 0,4,0 with the numbers that reference the CD writing
drive on your system.</p><p>I have simplified this process with a package called
<a href="http://www.flyn.org" target="_self">qtutils</a>, which includes a
script named vcdize.</p><p>Many DVD players can play VCDs in addition to DVDs. However,
some DVD players have trouble playing CD-R discs. My Phillips
Magnavox DVD 825 DVD player plays the VCDs that I have burned to
CD-R media fine.</p><p>Some relatively storage-space friendly alternatives other
than the VCD format exist, including MPEG-2 and QuickTime using the
OpenDivX and Ogg Vorbis codecs. These formats may be played with a
computer using video players that use the QuickTime for Linux
library such as
<a href="http://www.heroinewarrior.com/xmovie.php3" target="_self">X-Movie</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf30580.0x10293c8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>So there you have it. You should now be able to convert VHS
tapes to a more convenient format using free software exclusively.
The VCDs you produce will play in DVD players that support the VCD
format and CD-R media. For more information on this subject, visit
the home pages of the software projects I mentioned. Two very
relevant mailing lists also exist: the video4linux and mjpegtools
mailing lists, hosted by Red Hat and SourceForge respectively.
