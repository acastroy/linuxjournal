    A conversation with the creator of Python about an effort to teach Python to non-computer science students.

Conference in August in Monterey, California,
<i  >LJ</i> interviewed Guido van Rossum, creator of
the Python programming language. The first part of this interview
will be published in the December, 1999 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>At the end of the interview, Guido talked about a new effort
to turn Python into the programming language taught to college
students majoring in something other than computer science. He
seems very excited about this project, and we are pleased to be
able to share it with you here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I have one thing I
really want to tell you about&mdash;a project we currently call CP4E. I
can't even pronounce it myself! And it is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
related to R2D2 and C3PO, even though Python is very popular with
Industrial Light and Magic and the Star Wars folk. CP4E stands for
computer programming for everybody. We're sort of in the middle,
trying to get DARPA funding for this project. We're fairly sure we
will get a bit of funding for it in the next two years. We're
hoping to get a lot of funding for the next five years, in which
case we will do much more work, and we will also involve other
researchers.</p><p>What is the goal of computer programming for everybody? There
are basically two ideas; one is, we would like to teach
programming&mdash;actual programming, not Excel macros&mdash;to as many
people as are interested. The other idea is we want to make really
good programming tools for those people who are going to be
programming a bit. We think Python or something very close to
Python is an almost ideal language for teaching this kind of
audience.</p><p>We have a lot of anecdotal evidence that this is the case. I
think the best evidence so far comes from the Alice Group at CMU,
academic people who really like Python. They happen to have Windows
as their web form, but mostly because it is what the majority of
their students are using at the moment. They have made it
programmable&mdash;a virtual reality system. There is a rendering engine
written in highly optimized C++ that talks directly to the
hardware&mdash;well, almost directly. All the control stuff is written
in Python, so you build your entire virtual world in Python. How
you fill in your models and your 3-D objects is a different story.
The actual design of the object is done using other tools. But the
control, all the effects in the 3-D world, are controlled by Python
scripts.</p><p>Alice has done a lot of usability studies. They take actual
users and tell them, &ldquo;We are going to teach you a bit of
programming. Here is a bunny, and you can use commands to move the
bunny forward and backward.&rdquo; They sort of try to see which syntax
makes the most sense to those people who have never programmed
before&mdash;people from Humanities. This is like a &ldquo;freshmen in
college&rdquo; kind of thing&mdash;people who are absolutely not in the
computer science department. They form teams and have a sort of
friendly competition. Within two weeks, each team has produced a
couple of minutes of animation or an interactive game using this
system.</p><p>They have identified the two things wrong with Python&mdash;all
that language, and there are only two things wrong with it! One,
apparently, is that case sensitivity is something people don't
expect. This may be because they are all Windows users, and case
sensitivity is sort of unusual in Windows. In typical math, lower
case a and upper case A are different variables&mdash;you do not mix
them up. On the other hand, if you ask a typical person to write
down their user name or their e-mail address, they'll write it all
in uppercase because that is the only way they can write legibly.
So, it is just from their observation that most of the mistakes
their users make have to do with case sensitivity. They have
learned the command &ldquo;move&rdquo;, so they will type &ldquo;move&rdquo; with an
uppercase &ldquo;m&rdquo; or all uppercase letters. The other thing is a real
minor nit, where Python borrows integer division from C; so, three
divided by four is zero&mdash;not good. But with those two things fixed,
Python makes an ideal language for teaching.</p><p>We are going to get in touch with schools, initially local
schools, so we can actually pay visits frequently. First, we are
going to produce teaching materials&mdash;a whole course. There aren't
currently any programming courses using Python for people who
haven't programmed before. There are a bunch of excellent
tutorials, but even <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span> assumes
you already know how to program and your basic questions are,
&ldquo;What does a function look like in Python? What are the semantics
variable in Python? How do I look over an array of data in
Python?&rdquo; It also assumes your questions aren't &ldquo;What is a
function? What is a variable? What is a name? What is a string?
What is the difference between constants and variables?&rdquo; So we are
going to write a very different kind of tutorial that focuses on
those things using Python, a language that doesn't get in the way
of teaching concepts.</p><p>If you see what they are currently using in high schools&mdash;if
they teach programming at all&mdash;it's C++! They used to have Pascal,
which was a good teaching language, unfortunately, it was so
completely extinct outside the schools that I think two years ago
they changed to C++, because at least it has real-world
relevance.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: C++ is a scary thing
to wave in front of someone who doesn't know how to program!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: The teachers I have
heard from so far all find it a disaster! Probably partly because
they don't understand C++ very well themselves, and I don't blame
them! It's not their job. Even if they are a computer science
teacher, they are often more likely a math teacher who also teaches
on computers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: That sure isn't going
to move it into the Humanities department!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Yeah! So a language
like Python, which actually has roots in educational languages,
will do better. Python is very strongly inspired by a language
called ABC; I worked on the ABC implementation designed by
colleagues of mine in the early '80s. It was a wonderful language
for teaching. The history of Python comes out of the frustration I
had with that language when it wasn't being used for teaching, but
for day-to-day ad hoc programming&mdash;but that's a different story.
Python inherits a lot of that focus to make it very simple, easy to
understand, easy to remember and easy to learn. It's a very good
language to start teaching. We are very hopeful about that side of
the CP4E effort.</p><p>The other side, which is possibly even more exciting, is
tools. If you look at a typical programming environment, whether it
is for Java or C++ or Visual Basic, they are all extremely
complicated because they are aimed at the professional programmers
who need so many different features. Programmers can deal with the
complexity, because they've spent some time learning it and
possibly even customizing it, so they have the feeling they own it
and they can deal with all the different panels and menus and
dialogs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Sort of like me using
vi. I've been using it since 1983, and I'm just starting to get
comfortable!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Yeah! There is
probably very little that anyone can teach you about vi. For the
kind of casual programmers we are going to try to train here, their
needs in a programming environment are very different. I mean,
something like the old Turbo Pascal was probably a much better
match. So, I actually have done something that might be the
prototype for a typical development environment for Python, which
is basically just the Python text editor doing colorization and
automatic indentation of your source code. Also, it will have an
interactive shell where you can type your Python commands, and it
will use the same colorization and indentation and have a class
browser and a few other features, including a half-finished
debugger that needs a lot of work before it's usable. That could be
the start of the kind of programming environment we are thinking
about.</p><p>What I think will make it really interesting is program
analysis tools. If you have a large program written by someone else
in Python and there is some hope of understanding it, it's going to
take a lot of time just to find your way around in it. We hope we
can produce a bunch of program-understanding tools. The tools
probably won't understand the program, but they
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> help you understand it by giving you a
road map of the software, allowing you to focus on the part you are
interested in changing.</p><p>My example of something where this doesn't work very well is
Mozilla. It would be so wonderful if people could actually change
the Mozilla source code so they could recompile it to have a
Netscape that did something different. I have a lot of complaints
about the Netscape I'm using on my system. But I'm not going to
rebuild it from the Mozilla sources, because there is no way I can
find the time to dig through the sources to actually fix what is
wrong, even though it looks like some of the problems should be
fairly simple to fix once you have found where to fix them. So we
are designing tools that help you, and we focus on use by
inexperienced programmers. The tools will give them a lot of hand
holding, a lot of insight into the existing code and will help them
get an idea of what the consequences of changes would be. That is,
you can say, &ldquo;Okay, now I have this code and I think I want to
make this change. You tell me where this variable is used elsewhere
in the program&mdash;what the dependencies are, what code is using this
function. Maybe this function isn't being used at all!&rdquo; Just like
in our DNA, there are large pieces of software containing unused
code. Nobody noticed it was no longer needed, so nobody bothered to
take it out. Now, a section of code looks like the place where your
font is being drawn, but it just so happens that a different font
library has taken its place.</p><p>So, if we get the DARPA funding&mdash;that's part of DARPA's
expedition into the future&mdash;CP4E will cause a lot of excitement in
the Python world in the next five years.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: It sounds cool to me.
I've taught programming, and basically, I found if people learn
Basic as their first language, they are much harder to teach than
if they had never learned a programming language.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Basic is just about
the worst language you can teach as a first language.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: But with the death of
Pascal, there isn't anything else. Maybe people like me are still
employable because schools can't train programmers anymore.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I was just thinking:
you may be a little too old, but you must know the story of all the
retired Cobol programmers who are just now becoming instant
millionaires by fixing old Y2K stuff? Can you imagine the demand
for retired UNIX hackers near the year 2038?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yeah, it's the same
thing! I've told people, they've asked me, &ldquo;Well is UNIX
Y2K-compliant?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;No problem at all, but in 2038 I
plan on being retired, because it is not going to be a good year
for UNIX systems!&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks for telling me about CP4E. Watching it develop should
be most interesting.</p></div></div>
