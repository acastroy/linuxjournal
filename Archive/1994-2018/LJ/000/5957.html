    With LVM, you can combine partitions or drives into one large storage pool,
     called a volume group, and from there create logical volumes for filesystems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2e580.0x1b263f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Logical Volume Management (LVM) is an
abstraction layer over the hard drives, which allows the Linux
kernel to access the filesystems normally, yet each filesystem may
be comprised of multiple hard drives. The main benefit you may see
with LVM is when you run out of space in a filesystem (/home, for
example), you can either resize the filesystems on the fly, or add
another hard drive and spread /home across the two drives. If you
are running short on two filesystems, the new drive can be used to
augment both filesystems.
</p><p>Notice how I have avoided the use of the word &ldquo;partition&rdquo;?
Partitions do not exist under LVM. Under most Linux systems, a
partition is used to create a filesystem (formatted with ext2,
ext3, or reiserfs), then the filesystem is mounted to a mount
point. LVM can use your partitions, and combine them together in
one large storage pool (called a volume group). From that volume
group (VG), you create logical volumes (LV), which is like a
partition, from which you create the filesystems. Page 3 of
<a href="http://www.sistina.com/lvm_whitepaper.pdf" target="_self">the LVM
Whitepaper</a> (PDF) describes this concept in detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2e580.0x1b265b0"></a>LVM from the Trenches</h2></div></div><p>Last December, I set up my Linux workstation. Since I didn't
really know how I would use the machine over the next few months, I
decided to install LVM - I was trained in IBM AIX LVM, so I knew
what it could do. I also chose to create my filesystems using
ReiserFS, which turned out to be a huge benefit. Four months later,
I filled the /home filesystem. Traditionally, I would have been
forced to move stuff around, and make a bunch of symlinks to use
the space on another file system, or repartition, reformat and
reload my data. In this case, /home was 100% full, but my /share
and /tmp filesystems had several gigabytes of unused space on them.
The
<a href="http://www.sistina.com/lvm_howtos/lvm_howto/Why_would_I_want_it.html" target="_self">LVM
HOWTO</a> descibes a classic scenario like this one that
illustrates exactly why LVM is an excellent tool.</p><p>Obviously, the solution was to resize the LV's. However, I
had an old unused 4GB hard drive (more on this later) that I wanted
to add to the mix. I installed the new hard drive, set its
partition type to LVM (the whitepaper says this is not necessary
for LVM, but old habits die hard, and I did this before reading the
whitepaper), and added it to the VG. When that was done, I resized
the LV's to use the 4GB drive and to take some space from /share
and /tmp, and I gave it to /home.</p><p>This all sounds so simple, but of course, it was not. My
first snag was in trying to resize the reiserfs on /home. Since I
am using SuSE 7.3, I used YaST2. It showed me that my filesystem
was resized, yet df showed me the truth - my filesystem was still
the same size. Undaunted, I tried several more times. I fired up
YaST1, and it resized the ReiserFS with no problems.</p><p>The second snag is the old 4GB drive itself. My other drives
were 7200 RPM Fast IDE drives. The 4GB drive was a 5400 RPM [slow]
IDE drive. Because LVM blended it in so well to the VG, I now
suffered a data throughput performance hit. Before I used the 4GB
drive, I could move data from filesystem to filesystem with a
sustained data transfer rate of about 8 - 10MB/sec. With the old
drive in place, my sustained data transfer rate was 1 - 1.5MB/sec.
It looks like you are limited to the speed of the slowest drive on
the filesystem, which makes sense.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2e580.0x1b26818"></a>Distribution Support for LVM</h2></div></div><p>Since LVM is a kernel device driver, it works with all Linux
distributions, however, only some distributions support LVM during
installation. As of this writing, only Mandrake (see figure 1) and
SuSE (see figure 2) support implementing LVM during Linux
installation.</p><p>

SuSE installer</b></span></p></div></div>
</p><p>SuSE's YaST administration tool provides a GUI-based logical
volume management interface. As mentioned earlier, I noticed YaST2
does not resize ReiserFS VG's properly. YaST1 works
correctly.</p><p>This brings me back to the benefit of using ReiserFS that I
mentioned earlier - the ability to resize the filesystem on the
fly. The ext3 filesystem has the ability to be resized, however,
that filesystem must be unmounted during resizing, and ReiserFS can
be resized while it is mounted and in use.</p><p>Regardless of which Linux distribution you use, you may
always use the command line to manage your LVM installation. The
LVM whitepaper provides an excellent discussion on using these
tools.</p><p>George Toft has been heavily involved in Linux system
