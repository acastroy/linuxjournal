    Technical editor Jason Kroll speculates on the release of hacker Kevin Mitnick&mdash;and freedom for the rest of us.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201f138"></a></h2></div></div><p>At 6:30 AM PST, Friday January 21st,
Kevin Mitnick was finally released from prison after nearly five
years of being held without bail and without trial since his arrest
in February of 1995. He was indicted on 25 counts of computer and
wire fraud, to which he initially pleaded &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; He was
ultimately coerced into a guilty plea when it became clear that the
government intended to keep him in prison indefinitely pending
confession, and that a guilty plea would accelerate his release. In
his recent plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to 5 of the federal
charges. The terms of his release leave him penniless, in debt, and
not allowed to talk about computers, or use a cellular or cordless
phone, for the next three years. He lists &ldquo;gardening&rdquo; as one
occupation open to him; even fast food work would violate the terms
of his release. The circumstances surrounding Kevin's imprisonment
have been the source of scandal and controversy for the years he
has been incarcerated. He is the Kevin of the FREE KEVIN
movement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201f240"></a>How he got there.</h2></div></div><p>Kevin had been charged with innocuous computer crimes before,
once in 1989 when he was accused of breaking into corporate
networks and copying random files (the typical trophy-taking
procedure of curious network explorers), to which he pleaded guilty
and served 8 months in solitary confinement on account of the
judge's fear that Kevin would be a threat to national security if
given access to a telephone (the specific story, as recounted in
various periodicals including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span>, is that
Kevin was thought to be able to launch nuclear missiles by
whistling into a telephone. Kevin was also recently placed in
solitary due to fears that he could use an FM radio for similar
nefarious purposes. Most recently, he was denied use of a modemless
laptop to review 9GB of evidence against him for fear that he could
be particularly dangerous with such technology).</p><p>With the memory of this eight-month trauma fresh in his mind,
Kevin disappeared on Christmas eve of 1992 to avoid further
questioning about more alleged exploits. He was consequently
reported to have made it to the FBI's &ldquo;Most Wanted List,&rdquo; (though
this turns out to be a complete lie despite its reputable source);
and was taken into custody in a big media spectacle after
<span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> writer John Markoff, who
calculatingly used his position to construct the Mitnick myth (with
numerous fabrications, including the above-mentioned &ldquo;Most Wanted&rdquo;
myth as well as the story that Mitnick as a teenager had
electronically broken into NORAD), coordinated with computer user
Tsutomu Shimomura and the FBI to find Kevin, write a book about
him, and sell movie rights.</p><p>Following his arrest, Kevin was denied a bail hearing and
accused of $299,927,389.61 in damages. Sun Microsystems alleged
that, by downloading the source code to Solaris (which was
available for $100, and apparently free for students), Kevin had
cost the company $80 million, a figure which Sun failed to report
to its stockholders and to the SEC, despite legal obligation to do
so. In fact, none of the companies that alleged losses (also
including Motorola, Fujitsu, Nokia, Novell and NEC) reported
anything of the sort either to their shareholders or to the SEC. It
turns out the government had coached these firms in how to estimate
their damages, although even the government hadn't expected them to
be able to arrive at such an enormous figure. Eventually the feds
convinced the court that $80 million was the most reasonable
estimate (much greater than the $1.5 million which the government
had first alleged&mdash;but less than the later $300 million corporate
allegations). In the end, estimates severely eroded and Kevin was
ordered to pay restitution of a little over $4000.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201f4a8"></a>Outrage and protests</h2></div></div><p>Kevin's case sparked outrage across the Internet because of
the flagrant violations of civil rights and the cruel,
authoritarian tactics of the government (including use of evidence
which was seized illegally). In journalist communities, many
questioned the ethics of Markoff, who profitted handsomely, was
friends with Shimomura and had a hand in the FBI takedown&mdash;facts
which he and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> concealed from
his readers. Civil rights groups from the ACLU to Amnesty
International and the EFF refused to stand up for Kevin, with
excuses ranging from not understanding the situation clearly to not
wanting to be associated with &ldquo;computer hackers.&rdquo;</p><p>Although many people were frightened and intimidated by the
spectacle, certain communities stood up for Kevin and opposed the
civil rights violations, government collusion, zealous persecution,
and the intrusion of the government in computer technology. The
most vocal of these was the 2600 community, a loosely knit but
intelligent and dedicated lot oriented around the eponymous
magazine also known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacker Quarterly.</em></span>
Spearheaded by Emmanuel Goldstein (Eric Corley), the community led
the FREE KEVIN campaign, which ranged in events from distributing
information, collecting defense fund donations, exposing civil
rights violations and government collusion, leaking documents and
sponsoring protests. Smaller protests localized around movie
theaters in order to distribute the truth about Kevin's predicament
to movie-goers likely to see the upcoming
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Takedown</em></span>, the heavily fraudulent movie somehow
inspired by Markoff and Shimomura's book. The height of the
protests came on June 4th, however, when protesters gathered by the
dozens outside of federal court-houses across America and at the US
embassy in Moscow, with a clear message: FREE KEVIN. A sky writer
even sprayed FREE KEVIN across the sky in New York, while an
airplane toted a sign. And, although not endorsed or encouraged,
dozens of websites across the world (including the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New
York Times</em></span>) had their pages replaced by FREE KEVIN
messages, placed there by Kevin supporters who favored law-skirting
PR tactics.</p><p>The protests did not lead to Kevin's immediate release; he
never got bail and never got a trial. However, they did raise
awareness across the board, exposing the immeasurable ignorance of
the government as regards computers, the maliciousness of the
courts and the medieval tactic of &ldquo;making an example&rdquo; out of Kevin,
so typical in computer crime. In centuries past, he might have been
impaled or crucified.</p><p>Kevin's plight touched many lives, thanks to countless
supporters of all age groups. Young supporters often wrote school
essays or articles for their school newspapers, and now educators
all over the country are aware of this esoteric, yet critical civil
rights issue. FREE KEVIN even appeared on national television and
in numerous media venues such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>ZDNet</em></span> (bonus
points if you find the &ldquo;freekevin&rdquo; in <i  >Linux Journal</i>). Even Miramax, who was producing the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Takedown</em></span> movie, apparently re-worked the
script to remove many of the defamatory allegations (such as Kevin
making racial slurs and physically assaulting Shimomura with a
garbage can, which is ironic since Kevin had never been anywhere
remotely close to Shimomura).</p><p>Although on one level Kevin is remembered as an early
contributor to the Linux kernel [a memory which the facts do not
corroborate], today he is more of an example to all computer users
of the dangers of zealous, authoritarian government, which isn't
exactly the example the feds hoped to make. Americans tolerated the
government's Drug War for years, despite its grievous offenses
against civil liberties and civil rights. However, now that the
government is arbitrarily stalking the computer community, more
people are resisting and fighting back.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201fa28"></a>The Rallying of Communities</h2></div></div><p>DeCSS is one important rallying point which brought the Linux
community and the 2600 community closer together. Although the
former has looked down upon the latter (often using derogatory
terms such as &ldquo;cracker&rdquo;) and although members of the 2600 community
have often been critical of weak security on earlier Linux systems
(often paying due respect to NetBSD and FreeBSD), both communities
rallied together to make sure the DeCSS source code was available
all over the net. The &ldquo;Whack the Mole&rdquo; technique (as one
Slashdotter named it) in this case was a joint effort, a mutual
decision by everyone involved to defy the law, in effect declaring,
one step at a time, the illegitimacy of government in affairs of
computers, cryptography and the Net. Both Slashdot (itself a
perfect example of the potential unity of diverse computing
communities) and 2600 have been accosted by the MPAA (Motion
Picture Association of America) for their role in distributing
DeCSS, and a fight-to-the-death legal battle may ensue (2600, a
pillar of its own ethics and integrity, steadfastly refuses to be
coerced or intimidated as a matter of principle, and as a result
may go down in flames, though I bet it will triumph). As a typical
sign of changing times for these traditionally divergent
communities, VA Linux's Chris DiBona is referenced right on the
2600 homepage, along with the EFF (which professes not to be a
defense fund for crackers). So much for stories of &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; being
closed and secretive types who associate with no one but
themselves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201fb30"></a>What does this mean for the Linux
community?</h2></div></div><p>In so far as there are divisions within the Linux scene,
there have traditionally been three figureheads who stand for
slightly different world-views: Linus Torvalds, self-proclaimed top
programmer in the world, author of the kernel and all around
popular and charming fellow, embraces everyone from the commercial
sector to the free software community, and is a favorite of
techies, kernel hackers and the press; Eric Raymond, president of
the Open Source Initiative, identified the open source methodology
and brought it to the masses when he encouraged Netscape to open
up, formulated <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>
which laid the groundwork identifying the bazaar (open source)
approach to software development and also developed an economic
model which, though not entirely accurate, provides the kind of
&ldquo;selfish agent&rdquo; model business people are looking for, as well as
business models for leveraging open source, and is a favorite of
those people known as &ldquo;suits&rdquo; and those committed to &ldquo;living in a
world where software doesn't suck&rdquo; (regardless of whether or not it
is free); and Richard Stallman, whose 15 years of work produced the
FSF, GNU Project, free software movement, and most of the important
software that runs on Linux, has always been a purist for free
software and stresses community, freedom and philosophy. Hence
Stallman is popular with anti-commercial sectors, the &ldquo;free
software community&rdquo; (slightly different from the open source
community or the Linux community), long-time free software
advocates, a lot of leftist types who are repulsed by
laissez-faire, free market rhetoric and consider free software more
a socialist/anarchist creation than a product of the free market,
and those who value the philosophy of free software over the
methodology of open source or the specific technical virtues of any
given kernel or software package. To oversimply grossly (and make a
rather arbitrary construction), we could say that Linus is the
figurehead of the Linux community, Eric is the figurehead of the
open source community, and Richard is the figurehead of the free
software community. When we speak of the Linux community, though,
we generally mean a vague, inclusive assortment of the three, and
in my mind anyone who uses Linux or otherwise identifies with Linux
is definitely part of our community, though others may
disagree.</p><p>Unfortunately, these camps seem to have written off the
Mitnicks of this world as &ldquo;crackers&rdquo;. Indeed, the Linux, open
source and free software communities have almost uniformly been on
a quest to abolish the 'misuse' of the word &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; to refer to
those who discover security holes and explore the matrix. Eric S.
Raymond (known as ESR), is very explicit about this point in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The New Hacker's Dictionary</em></span>, explaining the
origins of the term &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; and how the word has been villainized
by the media. He even jokes in his <span   class="emphasis"><em>How to Become a
Hacker</em></span> about the hefty prison sentences levied against
seemingly innocuous network explorers. Likewise, the free software
community is on too pure an idealist crusade to be involved in
exploring computers whose owners do not want uninvited guests.
Linux users in general are too busy building the most fantastic
operating system in history to be interested in cracking
techniques, and very many are system administrators who have been
plagued for years by silent intruders, so there are often years of
animosity coming from many Unix users. Nevertheless, our new era
may bring forgiveness, buried hatchets, cooperation and, most of
all, mutual understanding.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x201fd98"></a>&ldquo;Bonding by Mutual Ordeal&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>In a bizarre turn of history, happenstance and government
aggression are uniting the Linux communities with the 2600
community, bonding us by &ldquo;mutual ordeal&rdquo; (to use the expression of
one Lonnie Princehouse, quoted in a Jon Katz article on the WTO
protests in Seattle). We are all increasingly victimized by a
zealous government which does not understand computers or hackers,
and is consequently terrified of us and abusive. Murder makes
strange bed-fellows, and authoritarianism has a peculiar
characteristic of uniting brainpower against it (and authoritarians
will stop at nothing to stamp out rebellions or the human spirit in
general, though the flip side is that the human spirit will stop at
nothing not to be stamped out). Although there isn't tremendous
cross-communal love or genuine solidarity across communities as was
formed, for example, among some factions of WTO protesters,
reasonable people of the world are being taken hostage by inferior
intellects with all the authority, and we're standing up against
it. Time will tell if further assaults on our self-determination
and freedom will cause the prejudices and snobbery to fall away as
highly talented and intelligent computer users of varying interests
and activities come together through the net for mutual survival
and establishing a legacy of freedom. (To quote Doc Searls in his
very ESR-like soundbite, &ldquo;Freedom is an efficiency that drives
value.&rdquo;) Our world is changing, pardon the cliche, at the speed of
light.</p><p>Not so long ago, it seems, many computer programmers had
gotten accustomed to the typical paradigm: get a job at Microsoft,
write proprietary code, make a lot of money, buy a fancy car and
house; enforce copyright and patent laws, do what you can to get
ahead, your fancy car will be the path to happiness, and do not
sympathize with hackers, crackers, or revolutionaries. &ldquo;Windows is
the future! Get used to it!&rdquo; was the mantra. &ldquo;So, have ya freed
Kevin yet?&rdquo; was the hacker-harrying humor present among so
many.</p><p>Then, as the Internet kept growing, Linux hit the scene,
information became instantly accessible across the planet. No
longer were people chanting, &ldquo;Windows is the future, get used to
it!&rdquo; for it was clear that Windows was a sinking ship (or at least
a stinking ship, to quote Koji Yanagisawa). Open source had been
&ldquo;diagnosed&rdquo; and brought to the masses. The whole software
development model was turned on its head, largely from what the
Linux developers were doing, and also from the writings of a
certain wandering trouble-maker. The anarchy of the Net changed
everything... and the government crackdown on computers gained
steam.</p><p>Arguably, the major recent instance of this was the
&ldquo;lynching&rdquo; of Microsoft, a move ESR opposed as violating free
market principles (though many advocated government intervention
insofar as Microsoft was violating anti-trust laws, harming
consumers and hurting business for competitors who pressured
Congress), and a bit morally defeating for those who wanted to see
Microsoft fall of its own accord. However, Al Gore, self-proclaimed
inventor of the Internet, and numerous politicians had been
supporting various stupid bills including Internet censorship
bills, arbitrary and confused culpability bills (often making
sysadmins liable for their users' actions), and numerous absurd
assaults on algorithms such as mp3 (isn't it contrary free market
principles to make efficiency illegal?) and DeCSS, along with
reinforced copyright restrictions (extending licenses arbitrarily
so that corporations could continue to profit from material that,
at the time of creation, was expected to fall into the public
domain soon). Our liberties have, in fact, been under assault for a
very long time.</p><p>It is true that government has a long history of interfering
with technology, often correcting market failures for the benefit
of society (for example, the breakup of Ma Bell and the
investigations into IBM which held the giant still long enough for
Microsoft and others to get a foot-hold). From these institutions,
both Linux hackers and security hackers began exploring on
descendants of the operating system that came out of AT&amp;T, that
is, UNIX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x2020000"></a>Recently in the World of Hacking</h2></div></div><p>In the recent years, there was little distinction between a
cracker and a hacker. Robert Tappan Morris, for example, was
considered a hacker while a graduate student at Cornell. Then, his
Internet worm got released (and really misfired), wreaking havoc on
the Net, grinding roughly 10% of it to a halt and shutting down
more than a few locations. He had intended, apparently, to make a
simple worm that would crawl around a bit but not do any harm (in
order to demonstrate a security flaw he had found in Sendmail,
which is, to be fair, probably the source of more CERT advisories
than anything else) but an error in the code caused a small
catastrophe which was followed by government prosecution.
Fortunately for RTM, he did this before the government was on a
trip to make examples of people (and his father was an important
fellow, which may or may not have influenced the situation), so
although he was suspended from Cornell, fined, and forced to do
community service, he was not, for example, held five years without
bail or trial, or even sentenced to a single year in solitary (as
happened to our martyr Kevin). Indeed, even Bill and Paul
apparently spent much time hacking the time-sharing system at
Lakeside's computer lab so as to use the machine without footing
too many bills.</p><p>Hacking is probably a natural part of exploring computers, no
more malicious than figuring out how to put graphics in the border
of the C64, disassembling executables, running programs through hex
editors or trying to crack copy-restriction schemes on early
software. With a world as vast and seemingly limitless as the Net,
(and especially in the days before everyone was on it, when
commercialism was strictly forbidden) reaching out to the far
tentacles of the matrix was an exciting way to learn what was out
there, and that included digging around through various computers.
What's here? It's a host. What is it? Let's get in and see. Where
does it come from? What does it do? Whose is it? Why is it here?
What's on it? These sorts of explorations are a large part of the
excitement of youth. And it's a thrill for beginners even to use
anonymous ftp to jump into NASA, for example, and download press
releases. It's not much different from the time you might dialup
somewhere only to find that ctrl-C drops the software to a prompt,
or that you can get free telnet through the public library by
typing ctrl-], or that by dropping carrier while your ship is
loading fighters from a planet you can double the amount of
fighters on board, or that by covering one hole on that Cap'N
Crunch whistle... Indeed, computer crime, as it is often called, is
one of the few ways to keep entertained in the suburbs.</p><p>To learn about a system, it is helpful to explore. The
exploratory drive in humans is responsible for a bulk of scientific
progress (as well as conquest, colonialism and genocide). At the
very least, innocent intellectual curiosity is not a characteristic
to hate in people.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x20201b8"></a>People have Diverse Interests</h2></div></div><p>It is true that people take different paths in life. Many
people have a mind to share, to develop software and to build
GNU/Linux. Future generations will probably be very grateful for
this. Other people still prefer to concentrate on networking and
security, they find it exciting, like cryptography or a good sci-fi
thriller. Not all people can have the same interests, and when it
comes to what you do with your free time, it's hard to do something
that isn't what you want to do. Even within the Linux community
there are those who code the kernel, those who commit to massive
projects like Gnome, The Gimp, window managers, free office
software, Apache, etc.; those who prefer to develop multimedia and
use Linux for audio applications, and those who just want to make
fun games, for example. Many Linux users just love to use Linux for
the freedom, and many Linux supporters are most effective through
different channels. RMS will be remembered always for creating gcc,
emacs, the GNU Project and FSF, his saintly character, and his
eccentricities, whereas ESR, though he authored fetchmail and
numerous Emacs extensions, made the most impact through his works
such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>, his
economic and social analyses, his models for business, and
formalizing, organizing, and promoting Open Source methodology.
Linus, of course, is your typical example of someone whose big
success is in the code. Nevertheless, Linux brainpower embodies
more than just a bunch of kernel hackers.</p><p>Is it possible, then, that the whole computer community and
indeed the world at large stands to benefit from a diversity of
interests and aptitudes? In the struggle to save software, most
emphasis was on developers, and indeed they did the work, with
evangelists stirring up popular support and charismatically winning
over a public hostile to anything vaguely ringing of
socialist/anarchist overtones (good thing Raymond's a Libertarian,
eh?). What about the struggle to save computing from the clutches
of ignorant authority?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x2020370"></a>Is it time?</h2></div></div><p>Although UNIX users grew apart and wandered off to different
communities, including various BSD troupes as well as those people
known as &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; to the Linux scene, now may be the beginning of
a time when communities grow back together again, or at least gain
a better understanding of each other. Too many people are quick to
see a few 37337 h4x0r5 d3f4c3 4 w3bp4g3 and jump to the conclusion
that everyone out there interested in network security is a little
kid with a script who wants to write cryptic messages about owning
so-and-so and playing games on irc. Beneath this superficial layer
is a group of extremely dedicated advocates of freedom, truth, fair
treatment, free information, sharing, exploration, curiosity, and
knowledge, a true counter-culture which has remained steadfast as a
vanguard against injustices perpetrated by the government, by
corporations, by authoritarians. Yes, sometimes people think they
go too far and probably suspect they're characters in a
post-apolocyptic sci-fi movie. Still, the diversity among these
people who get written off as &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; is such that it is unfair
to characterize the group as a whole, and it is true that you will
often find refreshingly decent, compassionate values. Likewise for
the NetBSD and FreeBSD communities. While I am sure that Linux
types view them as competition, the BSD daemon
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> horribly cute, and last COMDEX they
<span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> have a girl in red vinyl... There have got
to be good ideas floating around, and I'm not so sure we want to
keep misunderstanding and/or ignoring each other.</p><p>The press has some excuse for misunderstanding computers,
security, Linux, hacking, cracking, and technology in general.
Everyone knows the press is stupid and intentionally misunderstands
things for the sake of a more palatable story. However, Linux
hackers, open source advocates, free software enthusiasts and, I'll
say it at the risk of offending a whole lot of people, hackers
across the board, would do well to understand each other, and stop
laughing when tragedy befalls people like Kevin. &ldquo;So, have ya freed
Kevin yet?&rdquo; isn't so funny when you're Kevin. First, they ignored
us, then they laughed at us...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x2020580"></a>Getting back to Kevin</h2></div></div><p>Kevin became a figure in the security hacking scene both for
his innocent openness (he'd operate under the name Kevin Mitnick),
and adherence to the hacker code: he never damaged data or altered
it in any way, he never stole, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>he never
profitted</em></span> from his extraordinary abilities.</p><p>Today, Kevin is legally forbidden from profiting from his
&ldquo;crimes&rdquo;, whereas there is no such provision to prevent John
Markoff from profiting from what I would call his crimes against
journalistic integrity, civility and honesty. This case is just
another example of how a few evil people, playing on the fear,
cowardice, and authoritarian brutality of the federal government,
can ruin a person's life, make a lot of money, and set a legal
precedent launching a War on Computing which we can expect will
trample over civil liberties with as much impunity as the War on
Drugs.</p><p>Maybe you didn't come to Kevin's aid when the government came
down on him. But let's just hope that when the government goes
after you, someone will be there to protect you. Although it's
crass and crude to make self-interest ploys (as in &ldquo;do this because
it's in your own interest!&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;let's do this because
it's morally the right thing to do!&rdquo;), self-interest at least is a
powerful argument for standing up against the War on
Computing.</p><p>I don't believe in or advocate self-interest arguments, so
let's put it another way. Kevin Mitnick is a human being, just like
you, and just like me, who lives on the same planet at the same
time, evolved from the same animals, sees, hears, touches, tastes,
smells, perceives the world in the same way as the rest of us. A
miracle of 4 billion years of evolution, like each and every one of
us. He is also a human being who has been abused by a zealous
government, indeed years of his life have been stolen and his name
tarnished. Who knows how years of stress, spending time in solitary
confinement as holidays and seasons drift by, endlessly awaiting
trial for crimes so minor it's hard to imagine they could warrant
jail time, being victimized by hateful authority figures who giggle
and laugh at his misery (as the judge was heard doing) have
affected him. How would they affect you? How does it affect you to
know that the everyday miracles of human ability to be aware, to
think, to walk one leg in front of the other, to open doors and
fetch jars, to see, to dream, to feel, are held hostage at the whim
of authority with little justification or compassion?</p><p>Remember that the full weight of the law can be brought down
on anyone, for a range of offenses such as using the wrong
cryptography algorithms, sending cryptography programs across the
border (making one a terrorist arms smuggler), running emulations
of old games on MAME (violating copyright law), downloading an mp3,
having a user on your ISP who has something illegal, possessing or
distributing a copy of DeCSS, trying to write a DVD player for
Linux, or even accidentally using some patented code in an free
software project. Wars on one thing or another, drugs or computing
(as Clifford Stoll notes, we're both called &ldquo;users&rdquo;), always have
victims. These people are all human beings, most of whom have lives
and friends whom they would miss dearly were they incarcerated for
these minor and arbitrary offenses. What is the cost of living in a
world where one false step can bring a vicious government down on
an individual? Thomas Jefferson warned against the practice of
creating crimes in order to punish them, but that is exactly what
the government is doing. We in the United States have more of our
population imprisoned than any other country, more even than
Fascist or Communist nations, and there is probably a reason for
this. The ultimate point, however, which has probably been lost by
now, is only that empathy makes us all the wiser. Hopefully empathy
will lead us to solutions for these problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x2020840"></a>The People United</h2></div></div><p>A troupe of unarmed citizens recently chased the military out
of my neighborhood when we were last invaded at the whim of our
less than popular mayor. I refer of course, to the Capitol Hill
neighborhood of Seattle during the World Trade Organization
protests last fall. The sheer number of us backed up the cops to a
street corner. Although they were armed with gas, concussion
grenades, riot gear and the whole lot, and could not lose face by
leaving the hill altogether (authoritarians will destroy the world
before backing down), after 2a.m., they took off when most us had
gone home (it <span   class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> a Wednesday night). The
point is not just to share war stories, but to illustrate that
sheer numbers of united people can counter illegimate
authority.</p><p>In the case of computers, it has been one long frustration,
the lack of respect Linux hackers often have for system &ldquo;crackers&rdquo;
(to be politically correct, this is a Linux site after all), and
indeed for the lack of Linux enthusiasm among the latter. It is
true that Linux folks have shown up at HOPE to show off the
GNU/Linux OS, but there is an air of disinterest about the
struggles of the respective communities&mdash;which does not make sense
as these struggles seem wholly philosophically consistent. Indeed,
the divisions seem based on intentional misunderstanding, with even
a twinge of elitism. However, it seems inevitable; the harder and
faster the government assaults us, the more it will drive us
together. Although it plays on the same &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; instincts
that have cursed humanity throughout history, the hope is that it
will actually unite us. Like Linux, in which we are establishing a
legacy of freedom, everyone has his or her own reasons for
participating. Some activists will be purely rational, interested
in what is objectively best for technological progress. Some will
be self-interested, concerned with preserving and protecting their
own liberties, and indeed some will be motivated to uphold freedom,
community and principles. All of this, of course, presupposes that
somehow in time there will be greater unity, and this in turn
depends on the tactics of the government and the
responses/necessities of various communities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x20209f8"></a>Never Again</h2></div></div><p>Kevin Mitnick may have suffered for years at the hands of
federal aggression, but his ordeal is winding down. We failed to
make a big enough commotion, maybe because we weren't as Internet
savvy when the whole affair started, maybe because we were
preoccupied with short-sighted selfish concerns, or maybe we just
didn't understand the situation and couldn't take the time to
learn. The stigma of &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; prejudiced many away from the cause,
including individuals and organizations who really should have
known better. Many people discarded the whole affair, saying
simply: &ldquo;well, I don't like Kevin&rdquo; without ever understanding the
deeper significant issues, or even knowing that they exist. Kevin
has been released now, though he is not truly free. He has not, in
fact, been truly free since his arrest in 1989. The nightmare he
has been subjected to at federal hands has about three years left
to run its course. At that time, a nearly middle-aged Kevin can try
to recover and salvage what remains of the years ahead. At least
the Linux kernel will be far along, so he'll have something to look
forward to, but that's not much consolation.</p><p>The government got away with some big injustices, while
personal hatred, prejudice and, worst of all, apathy, prevented
larger numbers from coming to Kevin's support. Too many people in
this world were concerned only with themselves, only with their
immediate gains. They were too self-centered even to think about
the plight of others long enough to realize that our fates are
collective and that standing up for any human is standing up for
all humans, including oneself. Pardon the trite Sixties
diatribe.</p><p>Fortunately, we now have a massive information network,
raised awareness and heightened sensitivity to injustice. Since
this affair was exposed, many people have lost what little faith
remained in the so-called justice system and the government's
feigned respect for civil rights. Many have realized that victims
of the government are sometimes not evil people, but merely victims
of a malicious government. It is a similar realization to the
understanding that laws define what is legal and not what is moral.
Because of this awareness and sensitivity to future anti-computing
spectacles perpetrated by the authorities, it is unlikely that the
government will be able to pull off an injustice of this magnitude
against an individual computer user without massive backlash and
protest. As we said to the police during last November's WTO
protest, as we knelt on the pavement while being sprayed with gas
and concussion grenades, &ldquo;the world is watching.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f27580.0x2020bb0"></a>All Together</h2></div></div><p>Although it seems premature to make such an assessment at
this point, it appears the struggle for the new era is not about
right versus left, one country opposed to another, one religion
against the other, but bottom against top, the powerless against
the powerful, the would-be free against the authoritarians. In our
case, this movement is a struggle for the survival of computing in
the face of ignorant, but strong authority, a crusade not specific
to any one community in particular, but crucial to everyone who
could benefit from technological progress and civil liberty. If we
form bonds of solidarity across the computing horizon, we will not
be moved, we will not be defeated. Freedom is not only an
efficiency that drives value and a desirable self-serving end, but
a moral imperative. All roads lead to Rome, and computer community
ideologies&mdash;Linux world domination, open source, free source,
hacking/cracking/phreaking ethos, cypherpunk et al.&mdash;point to
freedom. Free as in beer. Free as in speech. Free as in FREE
