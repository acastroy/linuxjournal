<a href="../000/7436.html" target="_self">Nick's March 8, 2004, update
article</a> for a new configuration that deals with
bogofilter's reversed command-line switches for marking
spam.</p><p>Eric S. Raymond's
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/bogofilter" target="_self">bogofilter</a>
is a fast Bayesian spam filter that implements the algorithm
described in Paul Graham's
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html" target="_self">A Plan For
Spam.</a> To make it easy for all
<a href="http://www.mutt.org" target="_self">mutt</a> users on my server to
use it, I put the following macros into the system-wide mutt
configuration file, /etc/Muttrc:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span> (save) is bound to run
<b  >bogofilter -N</b> before
saving<span   class="bold"><b>r</b></span>,<span   class="bold"><b>g</b></span>,
and <span   class="bold"><b>l</b></span> (individual reply, group
reply, and list reply) are bound to run <b  >bogofilter
-n</b> before replying<span   class="bold"><b>X</b></span> is
bound to run <b  >bogofilter -S</b> before
deleting</p><pre     class="programlisting">
macro index s "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -N\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;save-entry&gt;"
macro pager s "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -N\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;save-entry&gt;"
macro index r "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;reply&gt;"
macro pager r "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;reply&gt;"
macro index g "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;group-reply&gt;"
macro pager g "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;group-reply&gt;"
macro index l "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;list-reply&gt;"
macro pager l "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;list-reply&gt;"
macro index X "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -S\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;delete-message&gt;"
macro pager X "&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -S\n&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n&lt;delete-message&gt;"
</pre><p>You also can place these macros in your personal .muttrc
file. The logic for this setup goes like this: if you're saving a
message, that means it's worthwhile to you. Thus, we run
<b  >bogofilter -N</b>, which adds the words in the
message to the good list and subtracts them from the bad.</p><p>If you're replying to a message in any way, it is also not
spam. You obviously wouldn't be replying to spam, because that only
begets more spam! So we simply add it to the good list.</p><p>Then comes the new key, X. Note that this is shift-X, and not
lowercase x. It is a special &ldquo;delete as spam&rdquo; key. I use
<b  >bogofilter -S</b>, which adds words to the spam list
and subtracts them from the good list, because the assumption is
you're marking spams that bogofilter missed.</p><p>Here's how I use these keys. First of all, I put the
following three stanzas into my .procmailrc file, to run bogofilter
on all incoming mail:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0fw
| bogofilter -u -e -p
:0e
{ EXITCODE=75 HOST }
# file the mail to spam-bogofilter if it's spam.
:0:
* ^X-Bogosity: Yes, tests=bogofilter
inboxes/zztrash
</pre><p>This means that all mail gets filtered through bogofilter,
and it reinforces itself. All spams get added to the spam list, and
all good messages get added to the good list, so if spam evolves
this will catch it as time goes on.</p><p>Now I have put all caught spams into inboxes/zztrash, which
is the last mailbox I read. I read my normal inboxes, deleting
uninteresting but legitimate mail with the regular d key but
zapping spam with X. Remember, if something is in a normal mailbox,
bogofilter must have marked it as good, hence the -S to subtract
from the good list and add to the spam list.</p><p>Every mail I reply to receivers extra reinforcement on the
good list. It was added once because it wasn't caught as spam, but
it'll get added again because it caught my attention enough to
warrant a response.</p><p>Once I hit the zztrash folder, I check for any mail
misclassified as spam. I simply save them to the folders where they
were supposed to go! This runs them through <b  >bogofilter
-N</b>, which removes them from the spam list and places them
on the good list.</p><p>I have found that after only a couple days of mail, the
system seems to really be catching on to patterns in spam. I find
myself correcting less and less for the system, as it is getting
much better with the self-reinforcing stuff.</p><p>The setup comes with the caveat that the registration
performed by the macros is done in addition to whatever bogofilter
did when invoked from .procmailrc. For example, saving recognized
non-spam means that three things have happened:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>All words in the mail were added to the non-spam
list when it was processed.</p></li><li><p>These words are then deleted from the spam word
list, even though the mail was never added there.</p></li><li><p>The mail is again added to the non-spam
list.</p></li></ol></div><p>This is actually a desired, or at least acceptable, result in
my eyes. If I save a mail, it is something that is
<span   class="bold"><b>really</b></span> worth my while. The
belt-and-suspenders approach to marking it as non-spam, then, is
fine with me.</p><p>Of course, you can always change .procmailrc to run
bogofilter without -u to remove the feedback loop effects. That
makes the mutt keybindings the only commands the registration gets.
In that case, the -N and -S switches should be made -n and -s,
respectively.</p><p>See
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/bogofilter/bogofilter.html" target="_self">the
bogofilter man page</a> for a complete list of bogofilter
options. I encourage you all to play with bogofilter!</p></div></div>
