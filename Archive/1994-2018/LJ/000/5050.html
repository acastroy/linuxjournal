raided by special police forces at the whim of the Motion Picture
Association, an organization which affectionately refers to itself
as &ldquo;a little State Department&rdquo;. Jon's Linux box, his FreeBSD/Win2k
box, as well as his Nokia cellphone (which we are sure played a
large part in helping him to provide a DVD player for Linux, and is
likely to harbor dark and mysterious secrets) have been
confiscated. Although Jon was questioned for seven hours and then
released, he and his father are charged and could face fines and up
to two years in prison. The GILC, a coalition of civil rights
groups throughout the world (notably including the EFF), has
condemned the action as a violation both of the Human Rights
Accords of the United Nations and the First Amendment of the US
Constitution. Almost ironically, Jon's reverse-engineering rights
are specifically protected by the notorious Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (which itself is probably unconstitutional).
(Incidentally, many have questioned whether the American
constitution has much validity in Norway, a question of national
sovereignty which is often overlooked; the point is merely that Jon
violated neither American nor Norwegian law.)</p><p>DeCSS has been the source of much contention between the
Linux community and government/industry (it's hard to tell
government and industry apart these days). Linux hackers wanted to
play DVDs on their Linux boxes, while the movie industry wanted to
prevent people from being able to copy DVDs. Although currently the
sheer size of DVDs is a better copy restriction than the most
elaborate encryption, the techno-ignorant industrial lawyers
probably allege increased bandwidth and some new compression scheme
to make DVD distribution possible some day, as is currently the
case with mp3s (a fair expectation). Still, encrypting DVDs hasn't
any effect on whether or not they are easy to copy, so it's not
clear how the industry's line of thinking holds up (apparently
through techno-ignorance, though it's likely they have in mind
complete control of the player market which would make them greater
villains than we had initially suspected).</p><p>Jon and his group MoRE (Masters of Reverse Engineering)
managed to break the encryption scheme (the actual breaking of the
code is said to have been accomplished by an anonymous German
member), apparently intercepting the data as it passed through a
piece of hardware unencrypted (due partially to a design error on
the part of the hardware manufacturer). As cryptographers know,
it's not difficult to break encryption when you can watch the data
get decrypted, although such a feat of international significance
is outstanding, and pardon the age-ism (in technology, it seems age
can be inversely proportional to intelligence) impressive for
someone so young. Now 16 years of age, Jon is at the center of an
international scandal and a focal point in the ongoing struggle
between freedom-endorsing hackers and techno-ignorant,
corporate-controlled, authoritarian government. The danger,
however, is that the battle has escalated and American corporations
have such sufficient influence over police, even in Europe, that a
teenager can have his home searched and seized at their arbitrary
intimations.</p><p>One question is why. Why is the MPA invading someone's home
in another country and stealing this person's possessions to use as
evidence to lock him in an iron cage for a couple years? Why are
seven major Hollywood studios (Disney, Sony, MGM, Paramount, Fox,
Universal Studios, and Warner Bros) assaulting one person and his
father? They say it's because these studios are worried about
potential &ldquo;unauthorized duplication&rdquo; in the future (when everyone
has a T3 and terabyte hard drives), and they are worried about
losing a few DVD sales this way (apparently more sales than they
lose through not having a free DVD player for Linux). Of course,
the techno-ignorant industry doesn't understand that encryption
won't make duplicating DVDs any more difficult, but try telling
them that.</p><p>Or do they know already? The encryption would allow the
industry to put regional codes into DVDs, preventing American DVDs
from running in Europe (where movies come out several months later
and at higher prices), or preventing Indian DVDs (which cost less
since India has less money) from running in America. In essence,
it's an attempt to &ldquo;extract the consumer surplus&rdquo; by a technique
known as &ldquo;price discrimination&rdquo; (which is in fact illegal according
to US and much international law as well). If DVDs cost the same
the world over, prices would be lower for consumers. In addition,
the encryption facilitates censorship across continents and gives
the DVD Copy Control Assocation complete domination over the DVD
player market (which apparently involves huge licensing fees and
whatnot). But why, why won't they tell that to the judge? Why do
they keep lying?</p><p>The obvious conclusion would be that the industry is up to no
good and can't let anyone know. These are the same seven studios
who assault a human who exercises basic civil and technological
liberties, as long as profit is perceived to be at stake. In years
past, the predecessors to corporate leaders probably led invasion
armies to colonialize and plunder the world. As usual, the handful
of decent people is left to suffer. The more things
change...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e413f8"></a>Fight government&mdash;shoot back</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;We're going to need some bigger guns&rdquo; says EFF attorney
(presumably free-of-charge) Robin Gross as quoted on the
<a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_self">2600 homepage</a>.
Fortunately, on one level, you can't have much bigger guns than the
Linux community, the 2600 community, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Slashdot community. Hackers across the board
have been taking action against the MPAA's assault of civil
liberties by mirroring the DeCSS source code all over the Internet.
Indeed, after just one injunction was filed against Slashdot and
2600, hundreds of mirror sites sprung up all over. &ldquo;Whack the mole&rdquo;
on a grand scale (if you're the Slashdotter who came up with this
phrase, let me know so I can give you credit because this will be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> technique for civil disobedience in the
information age). Chris DiBona, Linux Evangelist from VA Linux, was
even handing out DeCSS source code in the court-room while the
judge was deciding on whether or not to allow the MPAA to get a
restraining order against, essentially, the entire electronic
world.</p><p>The problem, however, is the typical situation
revolutionaries face: in order to fight the system, we often have
to work within it. A close to home example is how Richard Stallman
had to develop his GNU project on proprietary Unix. Socialists
often have to work for the corporations and operate in the free
markets they oppose, because otherwise they'll die. Free marketeers
in communist countries again have to live in state housing, take
state jobs, receive state food and state money even though it seems
hypocritical. The GNU project even had to use copyright law in
order to create the copyleft which accomplishes everything
copyright restrictions are set up to prevent. In the DVD case, even
though the law is the bad guy, and we are very effective at
ignoring the law, a critical chance for winning the DVD war (which
is, in essence, a struggle to protect the freedom to
reverse-engineer, a freedom we cannot afford to deny the world) is
to win the battle on the legal front. We can distribute the code as
much as we want, mirror it, perfect free DVD players for all sorts
of platforms, but as long as we're in violation of the law, we're
open season for the government snipers. A world in which a whole
community is in violation of a law is a world in which the
government can arbitrarily arrest anyone, essentially a police
state. Another description of a police state is when the government
has all the guns, but who needs guns when you can have lawyers? A
crafty lawyer can arbitrarily point the guns of government at
anyone. Lawyers are one thing we need, to protect the first
amendment, before anyone has to fall back on the second, and
they're our key to success within the law.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e41608"></a>&ldquo;When I hear that word 'government' I reach for
my revolver&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>I will remember very clearly for the rest of my life that
night, early last decade, when I had to fill a travel bag with
hundreds of disks and thousands of pages of printed material and
run off to the woods to hide it in the hopes that when the police
came, they wouldn't find anything. People buried disks in parks,
demagnetized their hard drives (those who had them), even simply
destroyed collections of disks (or in one case, someone panicked
and destroyed a collection of disks I had lent him). We waited all
night but the police never came. In a few weeks, most of the boards
(BBSs) were back up. However, that marked the beginning of the end
for a lot of people, not because anyone got arrested but because
they finally got scared off. Living in terror of the government
wears on people, and I felt relieved when a couple years later I
largely abandoned the old ways in favor of the GNU/Linux movement.
(Nowadays I'm particularly careful; I haven't even got a home
computer anymore.) The point is partially to brag how cool I am,
but mostly to illustrate the point that living in terror of the
government is not a good way to live, though there's another lesson
here that you can break the law hundreds of times and not even get
noticed ...</p><p>DeCSS is not directly and exclusively about government,
however. The governments of the US and Norway would have ignored
Jon's contribution to the Linux community had it not been for
corporate pressure. Slashdot author Jon Katz has called it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>corporatism</em></span>: the collusion between
mega-corporations (essentially industry-wide cartels) and
government in their effort to propagate American-style corporate
capitalism across the world and arbitrarily construct laws that
actually have nothing to do with the typical free market rhetoric
which normally accompanies such tasks. (Not exactly the same kind
of right-wing fascist/socialist government a la Peron that
political scientists mean by corporatism, though similar in many
ways.) People like Michael Parenti have been writing and lecturing
about American imperialism for decades now, so the notion is not
something new. What is new is that with the fall of the Soviet
Union and (re)unification of Germany, global capitalism has
reasserted itself with invigorated violence and aggression
(although it <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> always been violent,
aggressive and imperialist, from the Roman Empire to the Hanseatic
League to the British Empire and beyond). The other new feature is
that there is a backlash against it, albeit not very strong.</p><p>The WTO protests in Seattle were a good example of global
capitalist violence directed against peaceful opposition, even
though huge numbers of people overwhelmed the police and ultimately
shut down the talks. However, the police had guns, gas and
grenades, and the people didn't, so the cops stormed about with
impunity assaulting anyone they pleased and ultimately chased
everyone away. Later, they would commit spectacular acts of malice
such as filling a bus with protesters and gratuitously discharging
gas inside the bus&mdash;which incidentally had no restrooms. When the
whole WTO affair was finished and the nearly 600
protestor-prisoners were released (after large, protracted protests
at the county jail), the police were never held responsible for
their actions and the victims were just left victimized and told to
be grateful and flattered that the police hadn't just killed them
outright. <a href="http://www.indymedia.org" target="_self">Indymedia</a>
is a good source if you want to read the extent of the brutality of
Seattle police, though that's old news and a bit cliche by this
point. The lesson is that authoritarians never back down. They went
after their opponents viciously during the WTO confrontation, and
they used special police to go after Jon Lech Johansen and his
father during the DVD affair.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e418c8"></a>What can we do?</h2></div></div><p>The hopeful characteristic in many of the responses I
received to my <a href="../000/5049.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Free Kevin&rdquo;</a>
article is that people want to know what we can do. All over
Slashdot people have been asking this about the DVD struggle, and
recently, Jon Katz has been called upon to provide a solution to
the problem of corporatism. This signifies a cooperative potential
across the computer world.</p><p>When it comes to moral behavior, not everyone can go out into
the world and do good things. However, most people appear to be
ready and willing *not* to do bad things. After all, inactivity is
easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e41a80"></a>Boycott the Motion Picture Industry</h2></div></div><p>It's really a moral imperative, otherwise the industry will
be using our dollars to attack Jon Lech Johansen, and that's pretty
traitorous on our part. It won't be difficult, just make a choice
to see independent films instead of Hollywood movies, if you have
to see films at all. Theater and opera are other possibilities; a
bit expensive, but hopefully you would find them worth it. There is
a wealth of entertainment available in this world, and sitting down
and staring at pictures, whether the television, the monitor, or a
movie, isn't exactly the best the world has to offer. I would
advocate boycotting television as well just because it's
insufferably stupid, though it's not directly related (movies get
shown on the telly, and Fox, at least, has broadcasting concerns,
but boycotting tv is less noticeable than boycotting the cinema).
If you have to see some Hollywood movie, you could try to sneak in,
or pay for another movie and then sneak into the room where your
movie is being shown (just to be difficult and cast your dollars
for a movie that isn't produced by Disney, Sony, MGM, Paramount,
Fox, Universal Studios or Warner Bros., assuming there are other
movie producers in mainstream cinema). Of course, you can also see
matinees which cost less. You could even make just one exception in
the case of major things like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></span>, if you haven't the
willpower for a complete boycott. The idea is to reduce
consumption, as far as you are able. The point is to vote with your
dollars; while I would advocate boycotting the motion picture
industry all together, as long as we seriously curb our
expenditures on movies (even by refusing to buy soda and candy,
i.e. sneaking in your own bloody candy) we'll send a message. It's
up to every individual to decide how committed he or she can be.
For me, it's not a sacrifice, I never see movies anyway, and I
haven't got a television or radio for that matter.</p><p>Specifically, boycott Disney, Sony, MGM, Paramount, Fox,
Universal Studios, and Warner Bros. All together. Everything they
do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e41c90"></a>Protest</h2></div></div><p>Activists might prefer a more pragmatic approach, such as
protesting with giant signs outside of theaters. The 2600 cats did
this when Miramax was producing a heavily fraudulent film (based on
a largely fabricated and defamatory book) about Kevin Mitnick. The
protest was effective, and the executives had the script
re-written. Monster corporations going after a kid and his dad look
horrible (and for the sake of our struggle we'll get more sympathy
if Jon comes across as a little kid instead of a technologically
proficient, young adult). It <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> pretty sick,
it's corporate assault on the family, after all. If the DeCSS
situation doesn't go away soon, it's likely we'll see announcements
on Slashdot and elsewhere about where and when the protests are and
whatnot. 2600 is already advocating protests, check out their
<a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_self">website</a> for
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e41e48"></a>What about mpegs?</h2></div></div><p>The sneaky villain in all of this is the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA), who is secretly meeting in Seattle
at the moment in order to plot the demise of mp3s. How they propose
to do this is not known at the moment. The industry has been trying
to make the mp3 format illegal, which would be an interesting move.
Interesting, because once again it would prove that the free market
rhetoric espoused by corporatists actually has nothing to do with
their intentions: free markets are about efficiency above
everything else, and outlawing efficiency is completely contrary to
this alleged principle. However, that looks impractical simply
because the 3-digit IQ community wouldn't allow it. The other
techniques have been developing new CD players and CD formats so
that people would not be able to read CDs and turn them into files
on a computer. This restriction, we can guarantee, would be quickly
broken, and then we'd go through a DeCSS fiasco all over again. The
other problem is that consumers (remember, business people don't
refer to people as people, they refer to us as 'consumers') already
have these old CD players that can't play new, encrypted CDs, and
we'd all have to buy new players.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e41f50"></a>Copy Restriction Destroys</h2></div></div><p>I cracked my first game when I was in the second grade. I had
a Commodore 64, and it was more or less my life. I was very
excited, because I knew this could be the start of something. At
the time, I thought copy restrictions were immoral and that
information should be shared, I didn't know anything about free
software or open source, it was just an intuited moral attitude.
After a little while of opening games up with hex editors to remove
the passwords that you had to enter from a page in the manual, I
learned some tricky things about copy restriction.</p><p>One popular technique on the C64 was to fill the disk mostly
with unreadable junk, lace it with blocks of good data, and
overdrive the disk drive (old disk drives, for the 5.25" disks,
operated at 3 speeds depending on where on the header was reading
the data). So, you have a drive reading a disk full of bad data
(designed to throw off copy programs), spinning the disk at the
wrong speeds and grinding over bad blocks. You could literally hear
it grinding away, and it sounded horrible. The problem with this
practice, and with all of the techniques of bad blocks, blocks of
bad lengths, etc., is that it would ruin disk drives, literally and
aurally grinding them up; the most common problem was that it threw
the heads out of alignment, among other things. Now, if you were a
tech, you could open up your drive and go at it with an
oscilloscope to fix it. However, the fact remained, those greedy
software firms were producing software that damaged people's
computers all for the sake of stopping people from copying
software, which of course we did anyway. The destructive copy
restriction schemes <span   class="emphasis"><em>forced</em></span> us to crack them,
forced us to use cracked software. These troubles continued into
the world of Amiga, and I constantly found myself with misaligned
disk drives more often than not, and knowing that if I wanted to
get software to work, I'd either have to get software that didn't
have bad blocks, or I'd have to get a cracked copy; it was the only
way to protect my drive. I imagine the copy restriction schemes
alone probably caused more damage than the most malicious hackers,
crackers, and virii, and this says nothing of harm from the more
conniving things software firms have done.</p><p>The point of this is that corporations will destroy your
hardware without a second thought, they will also sell you products
that are bad for your health, and build cars that aren't safe for
you or the planet. Oddly, the corporate-irresponsibility attitude
is so prevalent today that anytime someone complains that a company
is harming consumers or destroying the environment, we get told,
&ldquo;Shut up! The company's out to make a profit, your moral
pontificating is out of line and inappropriate!&rdquo; Apparently, the
very fact that you're out to make a profit alleviates one from
responsibility. That's a pretty good deal if you're destructively
inclined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e42160"></a>Boycott Everyone</h2></div></div><p>Richard Feynmann, hero to intelligent people the world over,
once suggested that if an advertisement insulted our intelligence,
we should not buy the product. I've been trying that my whole life,
and it's made it impossible to purchase anything, which is probably
a good thing considering what I get paid. The point is, we vote
once or twice a year with our votes (assuming we have civil
rights), but we vote thousands and thousands of times every year
with our dollars.</p><p>Boycott the motion picture industry&mdash;it's a moral
imperative, otherwise we're voting with our dollars to persecute
Jon Johansen and his father, and that's the geek equivalent of
treason.</p><p>Boycott the recording industry&mdash;the RIAA is trying to
abolish mp3s, and that's just the start of their conspiracy. CDs
cost too much already, and pretty soon we'll be jerked into buying
new players and encrypted CDs that we can't read. We'll face
hardware that we can't control and algorithms we're no longer
allowed to use. We have to resist this assault on our technological
autonomy, which means not supporting the industry. Already the
industry charges stupidly high prices for CDs, so high, that unless
I can find a used CD, I won't buy it. $20 for a Cure album that
came out twenty years ago? I don't think so, and I don't buy it. We
can't contribute dollars to an industry that wants to invade our
world (computers), outlaw our algorithms, take control of our
hardware and data away from us, and sic the government on its own
citizens in order to enforce its weird, corporate ideas for law.
Maybe this means not listening to as much music, or borrowing CDs
from friends. Maybe it means downloading mp3s instead. Musicians
who are allegedly in music not for money, but for art's sake, would
want their music to reach the largest audience possible, and would
be flattered to see mp3s of their tunes travel around. Otherwise,
it's time for pop stars to admit that they're just in it for the
money, stop lying to their fans, and stop nominally pretending to
be populists and leftists and whatnot. I'm finished with buying
CDs, it's mp3s from now on, the way it ought to be (though I'll
have to get a computer to play them since I haven't got one right
now). Any rock star who whines about &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; should first admit,
&ldquo;Yes, I'm in it for the money.&rdquo; If we were all saints, we could
abstain from listening to proprietary music all together, but at
least for now we can stop paying for it.</p><p>Boycott Amazon&mdash;fight against software patents, and
besides, Richard Stallman said so.</p><p>Boycott anyone whose actions you oppose&mdash;every time you
spend money at a company with an agenda you don't like, whether
they do business with countries that torture people, or mistreat
their employees, or pollute, or support fascist politicians and
dictators, you've voting with your dollars in support of these
people, letting the corporations know that commerce and money are
more important than everything else, and you're ultimately the
reason they're allowed to get away with what they do. We don't have
to take to the streets with picket signs, smash McDonald's and
spray-paint &ldquo;meat is murder&rdquo; (as happened during the WTO protests),
or take to the hills. We can, however, curb consumption as much as
we can of bad products, and boycott as much as we can. Government
is not on our side, and we can not rely on government to regulate
corporations since in actuality it's corporations who regulate the
government. We'll have to do it from the ground up, by boycotting
everything we don't like. I boycott nearly everything, including
automobiles and gasoline, and it hasn't negatively impacted my life
a great deal.</p><p>I suppose no one would mind if we didn't have to fight these
struggles, if the battle for freedom were not necessary every
single day, if we could just live and enjoy. Unfortunately, we're
not able to do this, at least not for very long. Every moment our
technological freedoms are being eroded away by corporate and
government collusion. It's been happening for years, and it has
exceeded the basic copyright issues of years ago. For a long time,
Microsoft led the charge to deliver the software equivalent of a
car with its hood welded shut. We had to deal with proprietary
software for far too long, closed source binaries that we had no
control over, and this was often on computers where you were
effectively logged in as root <span   class="emphasis"><em>all the time</em></span>.
Secret codes got placed inside files, and pretty soon people wanted
to start monitoring users (and with IE linked right into your
kernel, it's an invitation for catastrophe).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d49580.0x1e42478"></a>Under Assault</h2></div></div><p>Fortunately, GNU/Linux saved us from this horrible fate.
However, the battle has hardly even begun. Web sites have started
monitoring users, even RealNetworks was covertly collecting data on
its users, and pretty soon DoubleClick will compile enormous
consumer databases. Bryan Pfaffenberger warned about this only a
couple months ago, and it seemed like a problem we'd face a few
years from now, but already it's here. (You can find Bryan's
columns, under <span   class="emphasis"><em>Currents</em></span>, at our index
<a href="/" target="_self">here</a>.) Emulation has been under assault for a
long time, with many companies hoping to make it completely
illegal, without any regard for the technological implications or
what it means for basic civil liberties in the information age.
Cryptography was under assault for a long time, but the NSA is
easing up and patents are expiring so we can hope for better things
soon in this area at least, which may be an important tool in
protecting our privacy from corporate control.</p><p>However, the technological world is increasingly held hostage
to corporate whim, whether through software patents, or just
lobbying groups who want to outlaw this and outlaw that,
arbitrarily molding the law and distorting the markets for their
own benefit. The boycott of Amazon.com hasn't put an end to the
one-click patent, but if the movement grows large enough we may be
able to put an end to all software patents. Right now the
government is ignorant of technology, and susceptible to anyone who
would seek to use it as a tool with coercive power for business,
hence the explosion of patents. This demonstrates corporate
America's eagerness to jump in and abuse government the moment it
becomes possible, so we would best be advised to make it impossible
for this to happen, and one good start would be the
<a href="../000/5074.html" target="_self">abolition of software
patents.</a></p><p>GNU/Linux was the movement that saved computing, and it's
clear what to do to contribute to that. However, the battleground
is much larger now, and it's less clear what we can do. The flip
side, of course, is that there are many more ways to contribute to
intellectual and technological freedom than were available before
Linux (where basically you can code or evangelize). There are
things we can decide not to do (whom to boycott), this sort of
action is easy, and there are things we can actively do. What this
will mean will become clearer as time goes on and the battle plans
materialize. Right now, the assault on DeCSS and mp3 is pretty
vague, but when we find out exactly what they're up to, we'll for
sure have an active plan of our own, and the brainpower to back it
