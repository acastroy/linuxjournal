affectionate creatures; compassionate, empathic, loyal, and
supportive... until food enters the picture. Then they become
whimpering idiots, begging, whining, contorting, groveling,
prostrating themselves, acting as fools. Food, you see, makes them
periodic imbeciles. The problem, of course, is that money has a
magnified effect on people. Out go all the morals, all the ethics,
every commitment, every belief, the moment the slightest bit of
cash enters the picture. How many
hackers/crackers/phreakers/warezmeisters fight against the system
until they get a high-paying job at Microsoft, only to turn around
and declare that all true hackers work at Microsoft and that
&ldquo;piracy&rdquo; is immoral, and free software is bunk?</p><p>As you may have heard, more than a few people have become
quite wealthy by selling free Linux software (or more specifically,
selling Linux stock), and more than a few people caught on. And
money is having its strange effect, hence the recent explosion of
Linux distributions. (Although it's questionable what's worse: what
money does to people when they have the opportunity to sell out and
make a bundle, or what it forces them to do on a daily basis.) Oh,
by the way, our recommendation that &ldquo;everyone should have his or
her own version of Linux&rdquo; was a joke, but if you've gone ahead and
done it, maybe you can grab some IPO cash, but don't count on the
community to support you.</p><p>Of course, there are the Linux firms that have been around
forever, firms like Red Hat and VA Linux which have had successful
IPOs and were around before Linux became trendier than &ldquo;e-business&rdquo;
and &ldquo;dotcom&rdquo;. These firms have also done a lot for Linux, both the
community and the operating system. As jealous as I am of Red Hat,
and even considering every irritating thing they do, I have to
admit they've supported kernel development and even took a stand
against the restrictive licensing of libQt by supporting the Gnome
project (and that was back when Gnome/Enlightenment wasn't even
stable, like it is today). Higher-quality distributions are out
there, but Red Hat isn't exactly a Johnny-come-lately. And besides,
look at the infusion of capital Linux received as a result of Red
Hat. VA, likewise, employs (supports) many of the top brains in the
Linux community, and supports more projects than I can keep track
of. Not only that, but VA fills one, if not the most important,
niche of commercial Linux, a premier hardware vendor&mdash;the hardware
icon for Linux. While investors probably expect software firms to
make more money than hardware firms, Linux people know the value of
VA to the community.</p><p>Then of course there are SuSE and Caldera, who have also been
in Linux forever and produce what many (myself included) consider
the highest-quality commercial Linux packages available in their
respective markets. SuSE is so complete and all-encompassing with
its 6 CDs of software and easy yet fail-safe installation. SuSE's
clever design of incorporating installed software into menuing
systems, the YaST program (for installing and removing packages
whenever you like), the thorough manuals, and the hardware support,
put SuSE over the top. Caldera, in turn, offers what is probably
the most cohesive distribution, ideal for VARs who want to install
a Linux distribution before shipping. Caldera also took a brave
step in introducing the first graphical, auto-probing, easy
installation software for Linux. Caldera prompted others to offer
similar auto-probing installers, as well as automatic sound-card
configuration (a traditional terror in the Linux world). These two
have been leading figures in commercial Linux (which makes Linux
palatable to the masses) for a long time, and we are waiting for
the inevitable IPOs, even though SuSE and Caldera have not rushed
in to grab capital but are waiting until the most appropriate time.
It is possible that by the time this goes to print, one or both
will have IPOd (Caldera has filed already).</p><p>Some people who <span   class="emphasis"><em>aren't</em></span> waiting for the
most appropriate time are crawling out of the woodwork. I keep
receiving distributions I've never heard of, and reading about
planned IPOs from the same (e.g., LinuxOne, though I have yet to
see a product from this one). These people <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
rushing in, trying to cash in on the Linux craze before the wells
dry up. What are the dangers of this? Suppose that these
fly-by-night operations aren't of the same caliber as the SuSEs,
Calderas, Turbos, Storms and Mandrakes of this world. Will
investors lose faith in the Linux phenomenon, thinking it has been
sucked dry? Will the legitimate, committed firms be able to get the
capital they can use for delivering top-quality, supported Linux to
the masses (and billions of dollars to themselves), ensuring that
future generations won't have to suffer through proprietary, buggy
operating systems? (And how much do we care about a few
opportunistic paper billionaires in light of the legacy we're
trying to leave?) Furthermore, when the public &ldquo;owns&rdquo; parts of the
Linux scene, everyone contributes financially, giving geeks the
freedom to develop what they want and giving everyone a common
interest in the continued success of Linux. Already, there is so
much capital behind Linux, it produces a massive incentive on the
part of everyone to keep us alive.</p><p>The issue with the new wave of aspiring Linux profiteers has
been the reaction of the community, which has been negative. Is it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bad</em></span> that we have had a negative reaction? We
do need to protect our integrity as a community (for whatever that
means these days), and we probably don't want to see newcomers
producing shoddy Linux products and selling them. If the products
are imperfect, or the support is bad, or the companies are found
out not to be dedicated to the GNU/Linux movement, the public may
be more reluctant and distrustful of Linux. We've worked hard, each
in our own way, whether coding or documenting, evangelizing or
giving tech support, helping out the occasional newcomer getting
his system installed, or even &ldquo;just&rdquo; using Linux (don't
underestimate how big a contribution it is just to make the choice
to use Linux), to insure that future generations will have the best
possible free operating system. As computers are in their infancy
(and humanity at large in an excruciating age), our actions and the
direction of our movement can leave a legacy of freedom for a long
time to come. We have been given by happenstance and history the
task of establishing a technological legacy; as the Buddhist saying
goes, we have been given a key to the gates of heaven, but this
same key opens the gates of hell. We cannot afford to fail, to
curse our people (which at this point ought to mean the whole human
race) with a legacy of proprietary software. The cost to humanity
when it has to back up and correct this mistake could set progress
back immeasurably, and hopefully we'll get our act together before
we burn up the entire planet. So, as our reaction protects the
integrity of our movement, it is a defensive measure.</p><p>The problem with our reaction is this is one of the few times
the community has said, &ldquo;You're not really part of the community;
you haven't paid your dues.&rdquo; It's true that ESR's &ldquo;How to become a
Hacker&rdquo; almost said something similar, because of the elitist
proposition that there is a social circle of hackers and you can't
join until they accept you (they call <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> a
hacker; you don't call yourself a hacker) and you have to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> good at hacking and intuit their secret
rules. This kind of social organization, based on exclusion and
secret social codes, is found in childish youth cultures and is the
same &ldquo;I'm part of the group; you're not part of the group&rdquo;
mentality that leads to race wars and genocide. (Fortunately,
Eric's article turns out to be more encouraging than anything
else.) Still, isn't exclusion one of the main things the free
software movement fights against? Isn't one of the strengths of our
community that we accept people regardless of any considerations
other than they want to be part of Linux? Eric Raymond has
libertarian values, Richard Stallman has socialist values, and
Linus just charms everyone. Look at the community at large: we
don't even speak the same language, share the same religion, or
view the world in the same way. Where else would you find
cooperation among such diverse people? Certainly not in typical
social cliques where everyone has to think the same, look the same,
act the same, talk the same, be the same. Linux has embraced
everyone, from the fanatical free-software enthusiasts (who built
the software for fifteen years before the apparent overnight
success of the Linux kernel) to the greedy cats looking for some
cheap way to make a buck, from the genius to the well-intentioned
beginner, from all fields of computing and with diverse interests,
so why are we now becoming exclusive?</p><p>It's probably because we've been forced to protect our
community, and as much as I hate to indicate agreement with ESR's
interpretation of Linux as a reputation-based selfish-agent economy
(which I suspect more than a few people find insulting), we have to
protect our reputation. The reason for this is not that we need
status to ensure we get better mates (as evolutionary psychologists
suggest); the community as a whole needs to see to it that
uninformed investors don't pour money into hack-jobs and Linux
projects that aren't the very best products we can show to the
world (remember, investors poured money into Microsoft, and look
what legacy <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> left for the computer world).
The GNU/Linux movement is our chance to set a precedent for the
world, to leave the human race a legacy of free software and at
least one kernel to run it on. Computers were once elitist tools,
and people who should have known better criticized the early Linux
pioneers as hypocrites for writing free software for expensive
machines. (Apparently, this is somehow hypocritical, probably
having to do with the short-sighted assumption that the only value
of freedom is saving money in the short run, and with people not
foreseeing computers becoming key counterparts to the human being
in short order.) It even once seemed strangely perverse to be on a
moral crusade over the principles concerning a tool that only the
wealthiest one percent of the world owned, but it is becoming clear
now that the implications of what happens will soon reach to nearly
every living human, as computers are becoming an essential fact of
life, soon as important to our own tragic and pathetic age as fire
and language were to early humans.</p><p>In short, the sad fact of all this is that LinuxOne has hurt
the Linux community because it forced us to be exclusive,
protective, to say this is &ldquo;our&rdquo; operating system but not &ldquo;your&rdquo;
operating system as well. We lose a kind of innocence, and we run
the risk on continuing down this path of &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo;. Already,
there is a disturbing alienation between computer communities, each
looking down on the others, and while this line of thinking can
give a community an identity, it can also cause internal divisions,
alienating those who are parts of a few communities, who don't
participate in the &ldquo;our group looks down on your group&rdquo; game. (In
these cases, I should note that I am speaking of the divide between
the GNU/Linux scene, the hacking/cracking/phreaking scene, the
warez scene, and perhaps even the decrepit demo scene.)</p><p>Of course, the LinuxOne situation can also help us, if it is
true that that which does not kill us serves to make us stronger.
If Robert Tappan Morris had not released his Internet worm years
ago, how secure would we actually be today? He got in a lot of
trouble for doing the world a big favor. Without hackers (er,
&ldquo;crackers&rdquo; in Linux parlance) constantly discovering security
flaws, how safe would our networks be against real terrorism and
corporate espionage? This is not to say that LinuxOne has done us a
big favor the way hackers/crackers have; in actuality, it has been
about as nice as the guy who first trademarked Linux. It forced us
to take a defensive action, but if we are successful, we'll deal
with these things now and hopefully we can establish a precedent to
extinguish these problems early and get on with more important
things.</p><p>One other issue remains: that of the whole commercial
&ldquo;side-taking&rdquo; we end up having to engage in. The whole business of
the community standing up and saying that some firms have more
right than others to make a buck from the Linux movement ends up
polarizing and politicizing us, distracting us from technical
considerations and into the market sphere. On one hand, it may
signal to the market that Linux is for real and that the community
is willing to take a stand against anyone who tries to corrupt or
exploit the movement. However, it does pull us down into the
commercial sphere, which, while it may be helpful, is horribly
trite. And, there is a danger we might make bad decisions, siding
with the wrong people, misunderstanding the market, compromising
free software principles, undermining our own philosophy,
frightening people away from Linux and open source, making
ourselves look fickle, disagreeable, uncooperative. If we take too
strong a stance, we make ourselves wide open to looking like fools,
and worse, to drawing dividing lines in our community. (Though with
the rapid exchange of ideas via the 'net, the threat of taking the
wrong stance is not particularly big.) Hence, it is probably safest
just to ignore LinuxOne, decline any stock offerings, expose the
company for what it is, and not harbor too much resentment against
the people who made LinuxOne; after all, they're just silly apes
being foolish over green bananas.</p></div></div>
