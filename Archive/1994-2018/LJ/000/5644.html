    Jon takes a look at Xine, VideoLAN Client, MPlayer and
    Ogle&mdash;four GNU/Linux DVD playback applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffa580.0x20f2240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Playing DVDs under GNU/Linux has not had
the happiest of histories, what with the DeCSS debacle and
subsequent legal battle. So you'd be forgiven for thinking that you
will never be able to play your DVDs on your GNU/Linux system.
Luckily, this is not the case, and there are several applications
available for you to download and use. The issue with DeCSS is
still with us but is slowly getting clearer. However, this has left
some of the DVD players officially not supporting encrypted DVDs,
although unofficially, playback is possible via third-party
additions.</p><p>This introduction to DVD playback applications for GNU/Linux
looks at Xine, VideoLAN Client, MPlayer and Ogle. In addition to
playing encrypted DVDs, unofficially in some cases, several of
these players also will play back other file formats.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffa580.0x20f23a0"></a>Xine</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://xine.sourceforge.net" target="_self">Xine</a> has
quite a large following, and for good reason, as it is a very
capable DVD player. In addition, like most of the players reviewed
here, Xine is capable of playing a large range of file types in
addition to unencrypted-DVD playback. Xine easily can be extended
with additional functionality as it supports plugins that enable
you to incorporate new codecs (open- or closed-source) or any
additional function easily. There are many plugins available for
Xine on the Net ready to be downloaded.</p><p>Xine only supports the playback of unencrypted DVD directly,
but support for encrypted DVDs is provided by a third-party plugin
(xine_d4d_plugin). It is unlikely that Xine will support encrypted
DVDs directly. The legal status of this plugin is, as always,
debatable, but it is easy enough to find and install. There are
some useful links on the Xine web site, and a search at Google
should find the required links for this plugin. It is stated on the
Xine web site that encrypted DVD playback is not going to be
supported directly because of the legal issues that surround this
area. However, once you have installed the plugin, Xine's playback
of encrypted DVDs is smooth with no noticeable problems with audio
synchronization or any video glitches.</p><p>Xine's interface is tidy and provides most of the function
you might require. Depending upon your preferences, you may find
that it takes up too much space on your desktop. As Xine is
currently not skinnable, there is no way to change the size or
layout of the GUI. If you are running XFree86 4.x, with a supported
video card, you can switch Xine from windowed to full-screen mode
and back again smoothly. If this is not supported by your video
card or version of X, Xine still can be viewed in a window, which
is the default startup mode.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xine does not support DVD menus directly;
however, there is a plugin called dvdnav (available from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dvd" target="_self">prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dvd</a>)
that adds this functionality to Xine. This plugin is a must-have if
you intend to use Xine for DVD playback. The plugin works very
well, even with the complex animated menus that some DVDs have, and
although this is not required for DVD playback, it obviously gives
you complete access to all the features available. The code for the
DVD navigation was written referencing the original Ogle DVD menu
code base.</p><p>Xine is a good DVD player, and with the use of plugins it can
be extended in many ways. It appears to have a solid following,
which should ensure its survival. The interface, however, may not
be to everyone's taste.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffa580.0x20f26b8"></a>VideoLAN Client</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org" target="_self">The VideoLAN
Client</a> is part of the VideoLAN Project, a full MPEG-2
client/server solution. However, the VideoLAN Client also can be
used as a standalone program to play MPEG-2 streams from a hard
disk or DVD. It currently has GTK+, GNOME, KDE and Qt front ends
and can use either X11, XVideo, SDL or DirectX for video output.
For audio, VideoLAN Client supports OSS, ALSA and ESD. To access
encrypted DVDs, VideoLAN Client uses the library libdvdcss, which
is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block device
without having to bother with the decryption. VideoLAN Client does
not use DeCSS but a different implementation that does not use the
cracked Xing decoder key. The libdvdcss was written by the VideoLAN
Client development team, using the original DeCSS code as a
reference base.</p><p>DVD playback with VideoLAN Client is very smooth with no
noticeable problems with audio synchronization. When you start
viewing a DVD, it defaults to opening up a window to display the
movie, but you switch to full-screen mode quickly and easily by
pressing the F key, as with the other players reviewed here. The
switch from windowed view to full-screen view, and back again, is
very quick and smooth with no slowing of playback.</p><p>VideoLAN Client GUI is a rather large window by default, the
largest of the group. This seems unnecessary, and although you can
shrink it down, it does not scale very well&mdash;a minor point, but it
does seem overly big for what is a simple interface. That said, the
GUI itself is fairly easy to navigate, with buttons to Stop, Pause,
Forward and so on. Preferences also can be modified for items such
as the path to the DVD/VCD device, audio device and output to use,
the default interface and so on. It is the only player reviewed
here that allows you to modify the preferences from the GUI.</p><p>The only drawback to VideoLAN Client is that there is
currently no support for DVD menus, so you only can see the movie
and you cannot access any additional items. This is not a major
drawback and should not be held against VideoLAN Client as its DVD
playback is as good as Xine and MPlayer. If you are not too worried
about having DVD menu support and can live with the largest GUI of
the players reviewed here, VideoLAN Client is a good choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffa580.0x20f2920"></a>MPlayer</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage" target="_self">MPlayer</a>
is another movie player that can play most MPEG, VOB, AVI, VIVO,
ASF/WMV and QT/MOV files supported by many native, XAnim and Win32
DLL codecs. In addition to this you can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD,
3ivx and even DivX movies. In this respect it supports more formats
than any of the other players reviewed here.</p><p>In addition to all of these video formats, MPlayer also
supports a wide range of output drivers. It works with X11, Xv,
DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev and AAlib, and you can use SDL and some
low-level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and RADEON) as
well. Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can
enjoy movies in full screen. Lastly, MPlayer supports displaying
through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB and
DXR3/Hollywood+. Blimey that's a list and a half.</p><p>So this looks like a one-stop shop for movie playback, but
how does it perform? Very well. There are occasionally
synchronization problems with DVD playback but nothing too major.
The only thing to remember is that MPlayer does need to be run on a
fairly powerful PC (greater than 500MHz) to work properly. If you
are running on low power, MPlayer definitely is not for you. On
lower spec machines the audio synchronization can get very messy,
and the video becomes jerky, making the DVD, and other movie types,
unwatchable. If you are using a lower spec machine, VideoLAN Client
would appear to be the best option.</p><p>Encrypted DVDs are supported using the libcss library and,
optionally, libdvdread for chapter support. As with the other
players, encrypted support is not provided directly by MPlayer; you
will need to download the libraries yourself. Unlike Xine, MPlayer
does not support plugins, so you need to ensure that the libraries
are installed before compiling.</p><p>MPlayer does not compile with a GUI by default, which is a
little bizarre. To be fair, this is not a negative point as this is
not really required if you just intend to use MPlayer to play back
DVDs, as it does not support DVD menus. So having a GUI is not
really necessary for DVD playback. However, if you intend to use
MPlayer to play back other file types, you will need the GUI. To
have GUI support you need to specify this if you compile from
source by adding <b  >--enable-gui</b> to the configure
script.</p><p>To access the GUI you then either start MPlayer with a
<b  >-gui</b> switch (MPlayer does not use the standard
<b  >--</b>, which is usual for switches of more than one letter) or link
MPlayer to gMPlayer, and then call gMPlayer instead. Another hurdle
to get over with a GUI is that MPlayer is skinnable, but the
standard source code has no skin, so the GUI still will not work.
You need to download a skin from the MPlayer web site and install
it, which is an irritating step. However, once all these additional
steps are completed you are then presented with a usable interface
to MPlayer. The interface, using the default skin, presents a
simple and clean looking interface, that does not take up too much
screen space. For those of you that find the Xine interface a
little too bulky, MPlayer may suit you.</p><p>MPlayer's main drawback, or at least irritation, is that you
cannot access a DVD from the GUI; instead you have to start MPlayer
with the -dvd flag in order for it to play your DVD. To view
another DVD currently means that you have to restart MPlayer.
Lastly, there is no support for DVD menus available at present, so
you cannot access the additional features of your DVD with
MPlayer.</p><p>As a one-stop shop for movie playback, MPlayer scores very
highly. It is fast (assuming you have a fairly new PC), and DVD
playback is very good with no audio synchronization problems. With
the support for multiple file format, you may find that MPlayer is
all that you need.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ffa580.0x20f2df0"></a>Ogle</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd" target="_self">Ogle</a>
is purely a DVD player and was the first to support DVD menus and
navigation, the code of which is now used in the Xine plugin as
mentioned earlier. As with VideoLAN Client and MPlayer, Ogle uses
libcss and libdvdread to decode and read DVDs. The MPEG decoder
features various levels of acceleration to take advantage of MMX
processors and some hardware MPEG decoders.</p><p>Ogle can be run directly from the shell, but a GUI is also
available if you prefer. The GUI is more compact than VideoLAN
Client's, but manages to contain more functionality. All of the
major functions are present, such as pausing, forwarding the DVD
and menu keys. That said, the interface to the control GUI is still
larger than the standard MPlayer GUI and is not as nice to look at.
Unfortunately, although there is an option to edit preferences, it
is not currently functional.</p><p>When you first access your DVD from Ogle you are presented
with the DVD menu, which you navigate using your mouse. You also
can navigate the DVD menu by using the arrows on the GUI, but
navigation using the mouse seems to be the easiest method by far.
Unfortunately, playback of encrypted DVDs is occasionally not as
smooth as with VideoLAN Client or MPlayer as there are freezes and
audio glitches. However, this is occasional and does not detract
too much from watching a DVD, but it might be a consideration. As
with the other players reviewed, you can switch between windowed
and full-screen mode, and again, switching between the modes goes
smoothly.</p><p>Ogle does have a few drawbacks, the main ones being that
there is no chapter menu support, no angle selection during
playback and no closed-caption support. The most annoying issue is
that you have to restart Ogle to play another DVD, which is the
same problem MPlayer has. These may not be major issues to you but
are worth taking into consideration.</p><p>Ogle is the only one of the players reviewed here that only
plays DVDs and not any other formats. Its main claim to fame was
the DVD menu support, but thanks to the fact that Ogle is
open-source, the code base is now being used in other players. If
you only want to play DVDs, then Ogle is worth reviewing, but if
your needs are wider than that, you probably will want to look at
one of the other players.</p><p>In conclusion, playing your bought-and-paid-for DVDs under
your favorite OS is now achieved easily using any of the players
reviewed here. There are many other players available; the ones we
reviewed here have the most supporters and users. As always,
because there are a wide range of DVD players to choose from, you
should be able to find a player to suit your requirements. So go
ahead and enjoy your DVDs on your GNU/Linux box.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Kent</b></span> is a system
