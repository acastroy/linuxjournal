news that the Librarian of Congress had shot down the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp/webcasting_rates.html" target="_self">CARP
(Copyright Arbitration and Royalty Panel)</a> Report's
recommendations for internet radio. We're both at a
computer/telecom industry conference. Among the several other
people standing around hearing my report, huzzahs went up. CARP's
mandate would have taken effect on May 22, 2002.</p><p>CARP was widely regarded, especially in internet radio
circles, as a death sentence for the whole category. Instead the
sword cut the other way.</p><p>Here's how the death sentence reads:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>On May 21, 2002, the Librarian of
Congress</b></span>, based upon the recommendation of the Register
of Copyrights, <span   class="bold"><b>issued
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcasting-rates-order.html" target="_self">an
Order</a> rejecting the Panel's determination</b></span>
proposing rates and terms for these licenses. In such cases, the
law provides that the Librarian shall issue his final determination
within 30 days of his decision to reject the Panel's proposed rates
and terms. <span   class="bold"><b>The final determination is due on
June 20, 2002.</b></span></p><p>And here is the Order, complete:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the Matter of Digital Performance Right in Sound
Recordings and Ephemeral Recordings</p><p>Docket No. 2000-9 CARP DTRA 1&amp;2</p><p>ORDER</p><p>On February 20, 2002, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
(CARP) reported its determination to the Librarian of Congress in
the above-captioned proceeding. In accordance with
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap8.html#802f" target="_self">17
U.S.C. 802(f)</a>, the Librarian is given 90 days from date of
delivery of a CARP report to review the determination and issue a
decision setting forth the final royalty fee and terms of payment.
However, if the Librarian rejects the CARP's determination, section
802(f) provides an additional 30 days for the Librarian to render
his final determination.</p><p>The Register of Copyrights recommends, and the Librarian
agrees, that the CARP's determination must be rejected. A final
decision will be issued no later than June 20, 2002.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DATED:</b></span> May 21, 2002</p><p>SO RECOMMENDED.</p><p>Marybeth Peters, <span   class="bold"><b>Register of
Copyrights</b></span>.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thank you, Marybeth Peters.</p><p>Ironically, the CARP panel was convened by the Library of
Congress. The panel wasted a large amount of energy and time in the
course of recommending highly complex copyright obligations,
including payments for performance rights, all intended to fulfill
requirements of the
<a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~willr/cb/sos/dmcapage.shtml" target="_self">Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>.</p><p>Here's Kurt Hansen of the
<a href="http://www.kurthanson.com" target="_self">Radio and Internet
Newsletter (RAIN)</a> and
<a href="http://www.saveinternetradio.org" target="_self">SaveInternetRadio.org</a>:</p><p>This morning's announcement from the Librarian of Congress
makes perfect sense, as the likely impact of the CARP's
recommendation&mdash;the virtual shutdown of internet radio&mdash;would have
been totally contrary to the legislative intent of establishing a
statutory royalty rate in the first place!</p><p>One benefit of attending the Copyright Office's roundtable on
recordkeeping requirements two weeks ago was the chance to see and
hear Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and General Counsel
David Carson and realize that they seem to have an excellent handle
on the issues involved. The decision on an appropriate royalty rate
seems to be in good hands.</p><p>The CARP report drew immediate and steady resistance from the
moment it was published in February 2002. In
<a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/webcasting.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Webcasting
Legally&rdquo;</a>, Jamie Zawinski ran down the list of station
reporting obligations, prohibitive even for stations that have
troubled to keep records of what they've played and when, such as
the Linux-powered <a href="../000/5725.html" target="_self">KPIG and Radio
Paradise</a>. Those stations, which have up to several thousand
listeners at any given time, would have been bankrupted immediately
by CARP's payment obligations. Here's the math of the matter,
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article/0,,3_1000981,00.html" target="_self">according
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet News</em></span></a>:</p><p>Here's how the 14/100 of a cent per performance royalty rate
would translate for a webcaster with about 500 listeners per day:
500 listeners x .0014 dollars x 15 songs per hour x 24 hours = $250
per day or $90,000 per year, retroactive to 1998.</p><p>Recently, webcasters held a

of Silence</a> to protest CARP. I

Report</a></p></li></ul></div><p>This CARP report may be dead, but the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act remains in force, which means concerns about its
implications are still quite alive.</p><p>We still need to deal with the differences between our
default understanding of radio, and the DMCA's characterization of
internet broadcasts. Instead of &ldquo;stations&rdquo; with &ldquo;signals&rdquo; that
carry &ldquo;programs&rdquo;, the DMCA sees sources of streams that distribute
&ldquo;performances&rdquo; (that's the key term), as if the radio were a stage
in a performance hall. It presumes there is a business here and
wants to charge rates for it. The big problem is that no business
worthy of the noun has emerged in a state finished enough to even
begin guiding regulation.</p><p>The CARP report struggled at length with the perceived need
to describe a &ldquo;willing seller&rdquo; and a &ldquo;willing buyer&rdquo;. Terrestrial
commercial radio has never had anything of the sort, at least
between stations and listeners. Commercial radio's customers are
advertisers, not listeners. With internet radio, on the other hand,
listeners are in a perfect position to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>customers</em></span> and not just &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;. In some
cases, such as Radio Paradise's, there is real income through
PayPal contributions&mdash;up to thousands of dollars per month. But
Radio Paradise is the exception. Most web stations essentially give
the goods away just like terrestrial radio does, but potentially in
a far more accountable way&mdash;and that's the rub.</p><p>It's clear now that advertising isn't going to sustain
internet radio stations any more than it will sustain print
publications on the Web. In fact, it's an open question how long
advertising will remain a working source of revenue for terrestrial
radio stations, especially if new technology makes the
relationships between stations and listeners accountable, as TiVo
is threatening to do for the relationships between commercial
television and its viewers. What's at risk isn't the relationship
between stations and listeners, which has always been weak (since
listeners paid zero for the goods, their influence rounded to the
same), but between stations and advertisers. When mute buttons get
wired back to advertisers, the broadcast advertising game will be
radically changed, if not killed outright. Broadcast advertising
has always been inefficient, unaccountable and thick with unseen
but very real waste. Once the accountability appears and the
inefficiency and waste fully exposed, the only serious question is
how much advertising goes away.</p><p>So pay-for-play is the only choice. It's not without
precedent in terrestrial radio, since that's what has sustained
noncommercial broadcasters for many years. Public broadcasting
doesn't suffer that same split between customers and consumers that
afflicts commercial broadcasting.</p><p>Commercial radio broadcasters might not be willing to look to
the noncommercial model for guidance, but internet broadcasters
don't have a threatened revenue model to discourage them.</p><p>What they need now is a chance to develop. Stations like
Radio Paradise are pioneers, but it's too early to call them models
for a whole new marketplace. That marketplace needs a chance to
emerge and grow, which means now is the time to trust the Commons,
not to regulate it away.</p><p>Between writing the last paragraph and this one I scarfed
down a quick lunch in the informative company of Dave Burstein,
Proprietor of <a href="http://www.dslprime.com" target="_self">DSL
Prime</a> and co-host of the
<a href="http://www.pcradioshow.org" target="_self">Personal Computer
Show</a> on WBAI in New York. He gave me a high five when I
told him the news about CARP. Then, for perspective on the issue,
he offered this
<a href="http://vikingphoenix.com/public/rongstad/news/bamr/aboutajl.htm" target="_self">famous
quote</a> from A.J. Liebling: &ldquo;Freedom of the press is
guaranteed only to those who own one.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks to Marybeth Peters, thousands of internet broadcasters
still enjoy their first amendment guarantees. We need to do
everything we can to keep those guarantees safe.</p></div></div>
