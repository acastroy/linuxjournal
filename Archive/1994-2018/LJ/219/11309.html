Manage your Linux server without ever touching the command line.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x1533358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Whenever I introduce people to Linux, the first thing they bring up
is how scary the command line is. Personally, I'm more disturbed by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> having a command line to work with, but I understand a CLI can
be intimidating. Thankfully, not only do many distributions offer GUI
tools for some of their services, but Webmin also is available to configure
almost every aspect of your server from the comfort of a GUI Web browser.
</p><p>
I have to be honest, many people dislike Webmin. They claim it is messy,
or that it doesn't handle underlying services well, or that the whole
concept of root-level access over a Web browser is too insecure. Some
of those concerns are quite valid, but I think the benefits outweigh
the risks, at least in many circumstances.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x15335c0"></a>
What Is Webmin?</h2></div></div><p>
Like the name implies, Webmin is a Web-based administration tool for
Linux. It also supports UNIX, OS X and possibly even Windows, but I've
only ever used it with Linux. At the core, Webmin is a d&aelig;mon process
that provides a framework for modules. Those modules, in turn, offer a
Web-based GUI for configuring and interacting with d&aelig;mons running on
the underlying server. Modules also can be used to interact with user
management, system backups and pretty much anything else a user with
root access might want to control.
</p><p>
Webmin comes with a huge number of built-in modules that can manage
a large selection of common server tasks. The infrastructure is such
that authors also can write their own modules or download third-party
contributed modules. With the nature of Webmin's root permissions,
third-party modules can be a scary notion, so it's unwise to install
them willy-nilly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x1533720"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The Webmin installation instructions are on its Web site:
<a href="http://www.webmin.com" target="_self">www.webmin.com</a>. You can download an RPM or deb file if your distribution
supports it, but Webmin also supplies a tarball along with installation
instructions for most systems. If you use the RPM or deb files, I highly
recommend installing the APT or YUM repository rather than directly
installing the downloaded package. Not only will that allow for dependency
resolution, but it also means updates will occur with your system updates.
</p><p>
If you use the tarball for installation, the setup.sh script will walk
you through all the configuration settings. This is the proper way to
install Webmin for Linux distributions like Slackware, which don't support
RPM or deb files. Be sure during the configuration process that you select
your specific distribution, otherwise Webmin won't handle the
config files for your various services properly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x15338d8"></a>
What's the Secret Sauce?</h2></div></div><p>
The thing I've always liked about Webmin is the
lack of magic. The
underlying configuration files on your system are configured using the
appropriate syntax and can be edited by hand if you prefer. In fact,
if you already have configured services on your server, Webmin 
usually will read the configuration properly.
</p><p>
Sometimes it's a great way to learn the proper method for configuring a
particular service by configuring it with Webmin and then looking at
what changes were made to the config files. This is helpful if you can't
remember (or don't want to be bothered with researching) the particular
syntax. I've learned some pretty cool things about configuring virtual
hosts in Apache by looking at how Webmin sets them up.
</p><p>
It's important to note that Webmin can be configured to work over
non-encrypted HTTP, but because very sensitive data (including a user
account with root access!) is transmitted via browser, SSL is enabled
and forced by default. This means annoyance with unsigned certificates
at first, but using standard HTTP is simply a horrible idea.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x1533ae8"></a>
So What Does It Do?</h2></div></div><p>
Once Webmin is installed, it should detect installed applications on your
server and enable the appropriate modules. To log in, point your browser
to https://server.ip.address:10000, and log in with either the root
account or a user with full sudo privileges. The latter is preferable,
as typing a root user/password into a Web form just gives me the willies.
</p><p>
The first page you'll see is a dashboard of sorts. Figure 1
shows the details of my home server. It's been 44 days since our last extended
power outage (my uptime); I have some packages to update, and my file
server is almost full. The dashboard doesn't offer earth-shattering
information, but it's a nice collection of quick stats. The notification
about 44 package updates available also is a hyperlink, which leads to
the apt module. It makes for a very simple point-and-click way to keep your
system updated.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11309f1.large.jpg"><img src="11309f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The dashboard is simple, but quite useful.
</p></div></div><p>
Along the left side of the dashboard, you'll notice expandable menus
separated into subject areas. I've never really liked the categories in
Webmin, because so many modules naturally fit into more than one. Still,
I appreciate the attempt at organization, and I just search the menus
until I find the module I'm looking for. Figure 2 shows a mostly expanded
screenshot of the menu system. These are merely the services and features
Webmin detected when it was installed. There is still the &ldquo;Un-used
Modules&rdquo; menu, which contains countless other modules for applications
I don't have installed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11309f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The sheer number of Webmin modules is overwhelming, but awesome.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x1534068"></a>
The Mounds of Modules</h2></div></div><p>
Going back to those packages that need to be updated, clicking on the
&ldquo;Software Package Updates&rdquo; module (or just clicking the hyperlink on the
dashboard) will give you a listing of the outdated packages. Figure 3
shows my system. I've scrolled down to the bottom of the list to show
some of the little extras Webmin offers. There is a button to refresh the
package list, which upon clicking would execute <tt  >sudo apt-get
update</tt>
in the background and then refresh the page with whatever updates are
available. The same sort of thing happens when pressing the &ldquo;Update
Selected Packages&rdquo; button; it just offers a quick-and-clicky way to run
<tt  >apt-get update</tt>. Below those buttons, you can see a nifty scheduling option
for installing updates automatically. Like most things with Webmin,
this isn't some proprietary scheduler, it simply runs cron jobs in the
underlying system.

Figure 3. A GUI tool for updates on a headless server is very nice.
</p></div></div><p>
Other common system configuration tasks are available as modules
too. Figure 4 shows the crontab configuration tool. Figure 5 shows the
upstart configuring (which d&aelig;mons are started on boot), and Figure
6 shows the interface for viewing log files. All of these things are
configurable from the command line, but the simple, consistent interface
can be a time-saver, especially for folks unfamiliar with configuring
the different aspects of their system.

Servicing Servers</h2></div></div><p>
I've been a sysadmin for 17+ years, and I still need to search the
manual in order to get Apache configuration directives right. I think
it's very good for sysadmins to know how programs like Apache work,
but I also think it's nice to have a tool like the Webmin module (Figure
7) to make changes. Whether you need to add a virtual host or want to
configure global cgi-bin permissions, Webmin is a quick way to get the
right syntax in the right place.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11309f7.large.jpg"><img src="11309f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Apache has so many options, keeping track of them can be like
herding cats. Webmin helps.
</p></div></div><p>
The MySQL Module, shown in Figure 8, is a very functional alternative
to both the command-line MySQL interface and the popular phpmyadmin
package. I've found it to be a little less robust than phpmyadmin,
but it has the convenience of being contained within the Webmin system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11309f8.large.jpg"><img src="11309f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The MySQL module is very functional, with a consistent interface.
</p></div></div><p>
I won't list every service available, but here are a few of the really
handy ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SSH Server: great for managing user access and system authentication keys.
</p></li><li><p>
Postfix/Sendmail: e-mail can be tricky to configure, but the GUI
interface makes it simple.
</p></li><li><p>
Samba: there are a few other Web-based Samba configuration tools,
but Webmin is very functional and straightforward.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x192d440"></a>
When Configuration Isn't Enough</h2></div></div><p>
It's clear that Webmin is a powerful and convenient tool for system
configuration. However, some other features are just as
useful. If you look back at Figure 2, you'll notice a bunch of modules
in the &ldquo;Others&rdquo; section. Most are fairly straightforward, like the File
Manager. Modules like the Java-based SSH Login or the AJAX-based Text Login
are very useful if you need to get to a command line on your server,
but don't have access to a terminal (like when you are on your uncle's
Windows 98 machine at Thanksgiving dinner and your server crashes,
but that's another story).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11309f9.large.jpg"><img src="11309f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The command line in a browser is helpful in a pinch, but too slow
for regular use.
</p></div></div><p>
Another nifty module is the HTTP Tunnel tool (Figure 10), which allows
you to browse the Web through a tunnel. This certainly could be used
for nefarious purposes if you're trying to get around a Web filter,
but it has righteous value as well. Whether you're testing connectivity
from a remote site or avoiding geographic restrictions while abroad,
the HTTP Tunnel module can be a life-saver.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11309f10.large.jpg"><img src="11309f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The HTTP Tunnel is a cool feature, but it can be slow if you have a
slow Internet connection on your server.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x143b580.0x192d9c0"></a>
When Webmin Isn't Enough!</h2></div></div><p>
If you were thinking how great Webmin is for the sysadmin, but you wish
there were something end users could use for managing their accounts,
you're in luck. Usermin is a separate program that runs on the server and
allows users to log in and configure items specific to their accounts. If
users need to set up their .forward file or create a procmail recipe
for sorting incoming mail, Usermin has modules to support that. It
will allow users to configure their .htaccess files for Apache, change
their passwords, edit their cron jobs and even manage their own MySQL
databases. Usermin basically takes the concept of Webmin and applies
it to the individual user. Oh, and how do you configure the Usermin
d&aelig;mon? There's a Webmin module for that!
</p><p>
Webmin is a tool that people either love or hate. Some people are offended
by the transmission of root-level information over a browser, and some
people think the one-stop shop for system maintenance is unbeatable. I'm a
teacher at heart, so for me, Webmin is a great way to configure a system
and then show people what was done behind the scenes in those scary
configuration files. If Webmin is the gateway drug to Linux system
administration, I think I'm okay with that.
