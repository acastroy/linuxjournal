cPacket Networks' cVu</h2></div></div><p>
Data centers are getting faster and more complicated. In order to enable the higher
levels of network intelligence that is needed to keep up with these trends,
without adding undue complexity, cPacket Networks has added a new feature
set to its cVu product family. The company says that cVu enables unprecedented
intelligence for traffic monitoring and aggregation switches, which
significantly improves the efficiency of operations teams running data centers
and sophisticated networks. The cVu family offers enhanced pervasive real-time
network visibility, which includes granular performance monitoring, microburst
auto-detection and filtering of network traffic based on complete
packet-and-flow inspection or pattern matching anywhere inside the packet
payload. An additional innovation involves utilizing the traffic-monitoring switch
as a unified performance monitoring and &ldquo;tool hub&rdquo;.

Opera 12 Browser</h2></div></div><p>
Opera recently announced its new Opera 12 browser&mdash;code-named
Wahoo&mdash;with a big &ldquo;woo-hoo&rdquo;! The folks at Opera say that the latest entry in
the company's long line of desktop Web browsers &ldquo;is both smarter and
faster than its predecessors and introduces new features for both developers and
consumers to play with&rdquo;. Key new features include browser themes, a separate
process for plugins for added stability, optimized network SSL code for added
speed, an API that enables Web applications to use local hardware, paged media
support, a new security badge system and language support for Arabic, Farsi,
Urdu and Hebrew. Opera says that the paged media project has the potential to
change the way browsers handle content, and camera support shows how Web
applications can compete with native apps. Opera 12 runs on Linux, Mac OS and
Windows.

Don Wilcher's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Electronics with Arduino</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
If you are a home-brew electronics geek who hasn't tried Arduino yet, what the
heck are you waiting for? Get yourself an open-source Arduino microcontroller
board and pair it with Don Wilcher's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Electronics
with Arduino</em></span>.
Arduino is inarguably changing the way people think about do-it-yourself tech
innovation. Wilcher's book uses the discovery method, getting the reader
building prototypes right away with solderless breadboards, basic components
and scavenged electronic parts. Have some old blinky toys and gadgets lying
around? Put them to work! Readers discover that there is no mystery behind how
to design and build circuits, practical devices, cool gadgets and electronic
toys. On the road to becoming electronics gurus, readers learn to build
practical devices like a servo motor controller, a robotic arm, a sound effects
generator, a music box and an electronic singing bird.

Moxa's ioLogik W5348-HSDPA-C</h2></div></div><p>
Industrial automation specialist Moxa recently announced availability of its new
product ioLogik W5348-HSDPA-C, a C/C++ programmable 3G remote terminal unit
(RTU) controller adapted for data acquisition and condition monitoring that
leverages a Linux/GNU platform. This integrated 3G platform, which is designed
for remote monitoring applications where wired communication devices are not
available, combines cellular modem, I/O controller and data logger into one
compact device. Moxa emphasizes the product's open, user-friendly SDKs, which
reduce programming overhead in key areas, such as I/O control and condition
monitoring, interoperability with SCADA/DB and improving smart communication
controls, including cellular connection and SMS. The result, says Moxa, is that
engineers can create imaginative, user-defined programs that integrate with
localized domains, giving end users considerable additional value.

Jono Bacon's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Community</em></span>, 2nd ed. (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Huge need for your groundbreaking open-source app? Check. Vision for changing
the world? Check. Development under way? Check. Participation by a talented group
of collaborators? Inconvenient pause. Well don't worry, mate, because Ubuntu
community manager, Jono Bacon, is here to help with the updated second edition
of his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Community: Building the New Age of
Participation</em></span>. So that
you don't have to re-invent the wheel, Bacon distills his own decade-long
experience at Ubuntu as well as insights from numerous other successful
community management leaders. Bacon explores how to recruit members to your own
community, and motivate and manage them to become active participants. Bacon
also offers insights on tapping your community as a reliable support network, a
valuable source of new ideas and a powerful marketing force. This expanded
edition adds content on using social-networking platforms, organizing summits
and tracking progress toward goals. A few of the other numerous topics include
collaboration techniques, tools and infrastructure, creating buzz, governance
issues and managing outsized personalities.

BGI's EasyGenomics</h2></div></div><p>
Scientific inquiry will continue to advance exponentially as more solutions like
BGI's EasyGenomics come on-line. EasyGenomics is a recently updated,
cloud-based SaaS application that allows scientists to perform data-heavy
&ldquo;omics&rdquo;-related research quickly, reliably and intuitively. BGI adds that
EasyGenomics integrates various popular next-generation sequencing (NGS)
analysis work flows including whole genome resequencing, exome resequencing,
RNA-Seq, small RNA and de novo assembly, among others. The back-end technology
includes large databases for storing vast datasets and a robust resource
management engine that allows precise distribution of computational tasks,
real-time task monitoring and prompt response to errors. Thanks to Aspera's
integrated fast high-speed file transferring technology and Connect Server Data,
transmission rates are 10&ndash;100 times faster than common methods, such as FTP. BGI
is the world's largest genomics organization.

Bryan Lunduke's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Tycoon</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Bryan Lunduke gave us the official shout that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Tycoon</em></span>&mdash;&ldquo;the premier
Linux Distro Building Simulator game in the universe&rdquo;&mdash;has arrived at the
coveted &ldquo;One-Point-Oh&rdquo; status. In this so-called &ldquo;nerdiest

their own Linux distro...without actually building or managing their own Linux
distro. Remove the actual work, bug fixing and programming parts, and wham-o!,
you've got <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Tycoon</em></span>. Of course, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Tycoon</em></span> runs on Linux, but Mac and
Windows users also have the irresistible chance to simulate being a Linux user.
Features in progress include Android, iOS and Maemo versions, as well as an
on-line, multiplayer game, which is currently in limited beta.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Tycoon</em></span> is
DRM-free.

NGINX, the second-most-popular Web server for active sites on the Internet,
recently released a version 1.2 milestone release with myriad improvements and
enhancements. Functionality of the open-source, light-footprint NGINX
(pronounced &ldquo;engine x&rdquo;) includes HTTP server, HTTP and mail reverse
proxy, caching, load balancing, compression, request throttling, connection
multiplexing and reuse, SSL offload and HTTP media streaming. Version 1.2 is a
culmination of NGINX's annual development and extensive quality assurance
cycle, led by the core engineering team and user community. Some of the 40 new
features include reuse of keepalive connections to upstream servers,
consolidation of multiple simultaneous requests to upstream servers, improved
load balancing with synchronous health checks, HTTP byte-range limits, extended
configuration for connection and request throttling, PCRE JIT optimized regular
expressions and reduced memory consumption with long-lived and TLS/SSL
connections, among others. Developer Nginx, Inc., says that NGINX now
serves more than
25% of the top 1,000 Web sites, more than 10% of all Web sites on the Internet
and 70 million Web sites overall.
