Sometimes your interactive TCP-based applications
lag. This article shows you how to reduce the worst latency.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x19a51f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Are you tired of having to wait for seconds for your networked
real-time application to respond? Did you know that Linux has recently
added mechanisms that will help reduce the latency? If you use
Linux for VNC, SSH, VoIP or on-line games, you should read this article.
Two little-known TCP modifications can reduce latency by
several seconds in cases where retransmissions are needed to recover
lost data. In this article, I introduce these new techniques that
can be enabled per stream or machine-wide without any modifications to
the application. I show how these modifications have improved maximum
latencies by several seconds in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Age of Conan</em></span>, an MMORPG game by
Funcom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x19a5408"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
The communication system in Linux provides heaps of configuration
options. Still, many users keep them at the default settings, which
serves most causes nicely. In some cases, however, the performance
experienced by the application can be improved significantly by
turning a few knobs.
</p><p>
Most services today use a variant of TCP. In the course of many years,
TCP has been optimized for bulk download, such as file transfers and
Web browsing. These days, we use more and more interactive
applications over the Internet, and many of those rely on TCP, although
most traditional TCP implementations handle them badly. For several
reasons, they recover lost packets for these applications much more slowly
than for download traffic, often longer than is acceptable. The Linux
kernel has recently included enhanced system support for interactive
services by modifying TCP's packet loss recovery schemes for
thin-stream traffic. But, it is up to the developers and
administrators to use it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x19a5568"></a>
Thin-Stream Applications</h2></div></div><p>
A large selection of networked interactive applications are
characterized by a low packet rate combined with small packet
payloads. These are called thin streams. Multiplayer on-line
games, IP telephony/audio conferences, sensor networks, remote
terminals, control systems, virtual reality systems, augmented reality
systems and stock exchange systems are all common examples of such
applications, and all have millions of users every day.
</p><p>
Compared to bulk data transfers like HTTP or FTP,
thin-stream applications send very few packets, with small payloads,
but many of them are interactive and users become annoyed quickly when
they experience large latencies. Just how much latency users can
accept has been investigated for few applications. ITU-T (International
Telecommunication Union's Telecomunication Standarization Sector&mdash;a
standardization organization) has done it
for telephony and audio conferencing and defined guidelines for the
satisfactory one-way transmission delay: quality is bad when the delay
exceeds 150&ndash;200ms, and the maximum delay should not exceed 400ms.
</p><p>
Similarly, experiments show that for on-line games, some latency is
tolerable, as long as it does not exceed the threshold for
playability. Latency limits for on-line games depend on the game type
and ranges from 100ms to 1,000ms. For other kinds of interactive
applications, such as SSH shells and VNC remote control, we all know how
a lag can be a real pain.
It also has been shown that pro-gamers can adapt to larger lag than
newbies, but that they are much more annoyed by it.

A Representative Example: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Anarchy Online</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
We had been wondering for a long time how game traffic looked when one
saw a lot of streams at once. Could one reduce lag by shaping game
traffic into constant-sized TCP streams? Would it be possible to see
when avatars interacted?
</p><p>
To learn more about this, we monitored the game traffic from Funcom's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Anarchy Online</em></span>. We captured all traffic from one of the game servers
using tcpdump. We soon found that we were asking the wrong
questions and analyzed the latencies that players experienced. Figure
1 shows statistics for delay and loss.
</p><p>
In Figure 1a, I have drawn a line at 500ms. It is an estimate of the
delay that the majority of players finds just acceptable in a role-playing
game like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Anarchy</em></span>. Everybody whose value is above that line
probably has experienced annoying lag. The graph shows that nearly
half the measured streams during this hour of game play had
high-latency events, and that these are closely related to packet
losses (Figure 1b). The worst case in this one-hour, one-region
measurement is the connection where the user experienced six consecutive
retransmissions resulting in a delay of 67 (!) seconds.

New TCP Mechanisms</h2></div></div><p>
The high delays you can see in the previous section stem from the
default TCP loss recovery mechanisms. We have experimented with all
the available TCP variants in Linux to find the TCP flavor that is
best suited for low-latency, thin-stream applications. The result was
disheartening: all TCP variants suffer from long retransmission delays
for thin-stream traffic.
</p><p>
We wanted to do something about this and implemented several
modifications to Linux TCP. Since version 2.6.34, the Linux kernel
includes the <span   class="emphasis"><em>linear timeouts</em></span> and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>thin
fast retransmit</em></span>
modifications we proposed as replacements for the exponential backoff
and fast retransmit mechanisms in TCP. The modifications behave
normally whenever a TCP stream is not thin and retransmit faster when
it is thin. They are sender-side only and, thus, can be used with
unmodified receivers. We have tested the mechanisms with Linux,
FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows receivers, and all platforms
successfully receive, and benefit from, the packet recovery
enhancements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199dc38"></a>
Thin Fast Retransmit</h2></div></div><p>
TCP streams that are always busy&mdash;as they are for downloading&mdash;use
fast retransmit to recover packet losses. When a sender receives three
(S)ACKs for the same segment in a row, it assumes the following
segment is lost and retransmits it. Segment interarrival times for
thin-stream applications are very high, and in most cases, a timeout
will happen before three (S)ACKs can arrive. To deal with this
problem, you trigger a fast retransmission when the first duplicate
(S)ACK arrives, as illustrated in Figure 2. Even if this causes a
few unintended retransmissions, it leads to better latency. The
overhead of this modification is minimal, because the thin stream sends
very few packets anyway.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11180f2.large.jpg"><img src="11180f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199def8"></a>
Linear Timeouts</h2></div></div><p>
When packets are lost and so few (S)ACKs are received by the sender
that fast retransmission doesn't work, a timeout is triggered to
retransmit the oldest lost packet. This is not supposed to happen
unless the network is heavily congested, and the retransmission timer
is doubled every time it is triggered again for the same packet to
avoid adding too much to the problem. When a stream is thin, these
timeouts handle most packet losses simply because the application
sends too little data to trigger fast transmissions. TCP doubles the
timer, and latency grows exponentially when the same packet is lost
several times in a row. When modification is turned on, linear
timeouts are enabled when a thin stream is detected (shown in Figure
3). After six linear timeouts, exponential backoff is resumed. A packet
still not recovered within this period is most likely dropped due to
prevailing heavy congestion, and in that case, the linear timeout
modification does not help.

Limiting Mechanism Activation</h2></div></div><p>
As the modifications can have a negative effect on bulk data streams
(they do trigger retransmissions faster), we have implemented a test
in the TCP stack to count the non-ACKed packets of a stream, and then
apply the enhanced mechanisms only if a thin stream is detected. A
stream is classified as thin if there are so few packets in transit
that they <span   class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> trigger a fast retransmission (less
than four packets
on the wire). Linux uses this &ldquo;test&rdquo; to decide when the stream is thin
and, thus, when to apply the enhancements. If the test fails (the stream
is able to trigger fast retransmit), the default TCP mechanisms are
used. The number of dupACKs needed to trigger a fast retransmit can
vary between implementations and transport protocols, but RFC 2581
advocates fast retransmit upon receiving the third dupACK. In the
Linux kernel TCP-implementation, &ldquo;packets in transit&rdquo; is an
already-available variable (the <tt  >packets_out</tt> element
of the <tt  >tcp_sock</tt>
struct), and, thus, the overhead to detecting the thin-stream
properties is minimal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199e478"></a>
Enabling Thin-Stream Modifications for Your Software</h2></div></div><p>
The modifications are triggered dynamically based on whether the
system currently identifies the stream as thin, but the mechanisms
have to be enabled using switches: 1) system-wide by the
administrator using syscontrol or 2) for a particular socket using
I/O-control from the application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199e580"></a>
The Administrator's View</h2></div></div><p>
Both the linear timeout and the thin fast retransmit are enabled
using boolean switches. The administrator can set the
<tt  >net.ipv4.tcp_thin_linear_timeouts</tt> and
<tt  >net.ipv4.tcp_thin_dupack</tt>
switches in order to enable linear timeout and the thin fast
retransmit, respectively. As an example, linear timeouts can be
configured using sysctl like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_thin_linear_timeouts=1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199e790"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The above requires sudo or root login or using the exported kernel variables
in the /proc filesystem like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "1" &gt;  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_thin_linear_timeouts
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199e948"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(The above requires root login.)
</p><p>
The thin fast retransmit is enabled in a similar way using the
<tt  >tcp_thin_dupack</tt> control. If enabled in this way by the system
administrator, the mechanisms are applied to <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> TCP streams of the
machine, but of course, if and only if, the system identifies the
stream as thin. In this case, no modifications are required to the
sending (or receiving) application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199eb58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
If you care about thin-stream retransmission latency,
there are two other socket options that you should turn on using I/O-control: 1) TCP_NODELAY disables Nagle's algorithm (delaying small
packets in order to save resources by sending fewer, larger
packets), and 2) TCP_QUICKACK disables the &ldquo;delayed ACK&rdquo; algorithm
(cumulatively ACKing only every second received packet, thus saving
ACKs). Both of these mechanisms reduce the feedback available for TCP
when trying to figure out when to retransmit, which is especially
damaging to thin-stream latency since thin streams have small packets
and large intervals between each packet (see Table 1).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199edc0"></a>
The Application Developer's View</h2></div></div><p>
The thin stream mechanisms also may be enabled on a per-socket basis
by the application developer. If so, the programmer must enable the
mechanism with I/O-control using the <tt  >setsockopt</tt> system call and the
<tt  >TCP_THIN_LINEAR_TIMEOUTS</tt> and
<tt  >TCP_THIN_DUPACK</tt> option names. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int flag = 1; 
int result = setsockopt(sock, IPPROTO_TCP, 
                        TCP_THIN_LINEAR_TIMEOUTS,
                        (char *) &amp;flag, sizeof(int));

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199f028"></a></h2></div></div><p>
enables the linear timeouts. The thin fast retransmit is enabled in
a similar way using the <tt  >TCP_THIN_DUPACK</tt> option name. In this case, the
programmer explicitly tells the application to use the modified TCP at
the sender side, and the modifications are applied to the particular
application/connection only.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ad580.0x199f188"></a>
The Mechanisms Applied in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Age of Conan</em></span> MMORPG</h2></div></div><p>
We've successfully tested the thin-stream modifications for many
scenarios like games, remote terminals and audio conferencing (for
more information, see the thin-stream Web page listed under
Resources). The example I use here to show the effect of the
modifications is from a game server, a typical thin-stream
application.
</p><p>
Funcom enabled the modifications on some of its servers running <span   class="emphasis"><em>Age
of Conan</em></span>, one of its latest MMORPG games. The network traffic was
captured using tcpdump. The difference in retransmission latency
between the modified and the traditional TCP is shown in Figure 4.
</p><p>
During a one-hour capture from one of the machines in the server park,
we saw more than 700 players (746 for the traditional and 722 for the
modified TCP tests), where about 300 streams in each experiment
experienced loss rates between 0.001% and 10%. Figure 4 shows the
results from an analysis of the three first retransmissions. Having only
one retransmission is fine, also when the modifications are not
used. The average and worst-case latencies are still within the bounds
of a playable game. However, as the users start to experience second
and third retransmissions, severe latencies are observed in the
traditional TCP scenario, whereas the latencies in the modified TCP
test are significantly lower. Thus, the perceived quality of the game
services should be greatly improved by applying the new Linux TCP
modifications.

The Tools Are at Your Fingertips</h2></div></div><p>
If you have a kernel later than 2.6.34, the modifications are
available and easy to use when you know about them. Since you now
know, turn them on for your interactive thin-stream applications and
remove some of the worst latencies that have been annoying you. We're
currently digging deeper into thin-stream behavior&mdash;watch our blog
for updates on how to reduce those latencies further.
