<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #219, July 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
An interesting side effect of last year's cyber attack on the
kernel.org server was to identify which of the various services
offered were most needed by the community. Clearly one of the hottest
items was <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> repository hosting. And within the clamor for that one
feature, much to <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span>'s surprise,
there was a bunch of people who
were very serious about regaining access to the <span   class="bold"><b>2.4
tree</b></span>.
</p><p>
Willy had been intending to bring this tree to its end of life, but suddenly
a cache of users who cared about its continued existence was revealed.
In light of that discovery, Willy recently announced that
he intends to continue to update the 2.4 tree. He won't make any more
versioned releases, but he'll keep adding fixes to the tree, as a
centralized repository that 2.4 users can find and use easily.
</p><p>
Any attempt to simplify the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel
licensing</b></span> situation is bound to be
met with many objections. <span   class="bold"><b>Luis R.
Rodriguez</b></span> discovered this recently
when he tried to replace all kernel symbols indicating both the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL
version 2</b></span> and some other license, like the <span   class="bold"><b>BSD</b></span> or <span   class="bold"><b>MPL</b></span>, with the simple
text <span   class="bold"><b>&ldquo;GPL-Compatible&rdquo;</b></span>.
</p><p>
It sounds pretty reasonable. After all, the kernel really cares
only if code is GPL-compatible so it can tell what interfaces to expose to
that code, right? But, as was pointed out to Luis, tons of
issues are getting in the way. For one thing, someone could interpret
&ldquo;GPL-Compatible&rdquo; to mean that the code can be re-licensed under
the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL
version 3</b></span>, which <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> is specifically opposed to doing.
</p><p>
For that matter, as also was pointed out, someone could interpret
&ldquo;GPL-Compatible&rdquo; as indicating that the code in that part of the
kernel could be re-licensed at any time to the second of the two
licenses&mdash;the BSD or whatever&mdash;which also is not the case. Kernel
code is all licensed under the GPL version 2 only. Any dual license
applies to code distributed by the person who submitted it to the
kernel in the first place. If you get it from that person, you can
re-license under the alternate license.
</p><p>
Also, as <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> pointed out, the license-related kernel symbols are
likely to be valid evidence in any future court case, as indicating
the intention of whomever released the code. So, if Luis or anyone
else adjusted those symbols, aside from the person or organization
who submitted the code in the first place, it could cause legal problems
down the road.
</p><p>
And finally, as <span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> and Linus Torvalds both said, the
&ldquo;GPL-Compatible&rdquo; text only replaced text that actually contained
useful information with something that was more vague.
</p><p>
It looks like an <span   class="bold"><b>in-kernel disassembler</b></span>
soon will be included in the
source tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Masami Hiramatsu</b></span> posted a patch implementing that
specifically so <span   class="bold"><b>kernel oops</b></span> output could be rendered more
readable.
</p><p>
This probably won't affect regular users very much though. <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span>, although in favor of the feature in general, wants users to have
to enable it explicitly on the command line at bootup. His reasoning
is that oops output already is plentiful and scrolls right off the
screen. Masami's disassembled version would take up more space
and cause even more of it to scroll off the screen.
</p><p>
With support from folks like H. Peter and <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span>, it does look as
if Masami's patch is likely to go into the kernel, after some more
work.

<h2 class="title">Audiobooks as Easy as ABC</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #219, July 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Whether you love Apple products or think they are abominations, it's
hard to beat iPods when it comes to audiobooks. They remember your place,
support chapters and even offer speed variations on playback. Thanks to
programs like Banshee and Amarok, syncing most iPod devices (especially
the older iPod Nanos, which are perfect audiobook players) is simple
and works out of the box.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11295abcf1.large.jpg"><img src="11295abcf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The one downside with listening to audiobooks on iPods is that they
accept only m4b files. Most audiobooks either are ripped from CDs into
MP3 files or are downloaded as MP3 files directly. There are some fairly
simple command-line tools for converting a bunch of MP3 files into
iPod-compatible m4b files, but if GUI tools are your thing, Audio Book
Creator (ABC) might be right up your alley.
</p><p>
ABC is a very nice GUI application offered by a German programmer. The
Web site is <a href="http://www.ausge.de" target="_self">www.ausge.de</a>, and although the site is in German, the program
itself is localized and includes installation instructions in English. The
program does require a few dependencies to be installed, but the package
includes very thorough instructions. If you want to create iPod-compatible
audiobooks, ABC is as simple as, well, ABC!

<h2 class="title">File Formats Used in Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #219, July 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My past articles in this space have covered
specific software packages, programming libraries and algorithm
designs. One subject I haven't discussed yet is data storage, specifically
data formats used for scientific information. So in this article, I look
at two of the most common file formats: NetCDF
(<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf" target="_self">www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf</a>) and HDF (<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org" target="_self">www.hdfgroup.org</a>). Both of these
file formats include command-line tools and libraries that allow you to
access these file formats from within your own code.
</p><p>
NetCDF (Network Common Data Format) is an open file format designed
to be self-describing and machine-independent. The project is hosted
by the Unidata program at UCAR (University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research). UCAR is working on it actively, and version 4.1 was
released in 2010. 
</p><p>
NetCDF supports three separate binary data formats. The
classic format has been used since the very first version of NetCDF,
and it is still the default format. Starting with version 3.6.0, a 64-bit
offset format was introduced that allowed for larger variable and file
sizes. Then, starting with version 4.0, NetCDF/HDF5 was introduced,
which was HDF5 with some restrictions. These files are meant to be
self-describing as well. This means they contain a header that
describes in some detail all of the data that is stored in the file. 
</p><p>
The
easiest way to get NetCDF is to check your distribution's package
management system. Sometimes, however, the included version may not have the
compile time settings that you need. In those cases, you need to
grab the tarball and do a manual installation. There are interfaces
for C, C++, FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90 and Java.
</p><p>
The classic format consists of a file that contains variables, dimensions
and attributes. Variables are N-dimensional arrays of data. This is the
actual data (that is, numbers) that you use in your calculations. This
data can be one of six types (char, byte, short, int, float and
double). Dimensions describe the axes of the data arrays. A dimension
has a name and a length. Multiple variables can use the same dimension,
indicating that they were measured on the same grid. At most, one dimension
can be unlimited, meaning that the length can be updated continually as
more data is added. Attributes allow you to store metadata about the
file or variables. They can be either scalar values or one-dimensional
arrays. 
</p><p>
A new, enhanced format was introduced with NetCDF 4. To remain
backward-compatible, it is constructed from the classic format plus some
extra bits. One of the extra bits is the introduction of groups. Groups
are hierarchical structures of data, similar to the UNIX filesystem. The
second extra part is the ability to define new data types. A NetCDF 4 file
contains one top-level unnamed group. Every group can contain one or more
named subgroups, user-defined types, variables, dimensions and attributes.
</p><p>
Some standard command-line utilities are available to allow you
to work with your NetCDF files. The ncdump utility takes the binary
NetCDF file and outputs a text file in a format called CDL. The ncgen utility
takes a CDL text file and creates a binary NetCDF file. nccopy
copies a NetCDF file and, in the process, allows you to change things
like the binary format, chunk sizes and compression. There are also the
NetCDF Operators (NCOs). This project consists of a number of small
utilities that do some operation on a NetCDF file, such as
concatenation, averaging or interpolation.
</p><p>
Here's a 
simple example of a CDL file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
netcdf simple_xy {
dimensions:
   x = 6 ;
   y = 12 ;
variables:
   int data(x, y) ;
data:
     
 data =
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
  12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
  24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
  36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47,
  48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59,
  60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 ;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have this defined, you can create the corresponding NetCDF file
with the ncgen utility.
</p><p>
To use the library, you need to include the header file
netcdf.h. The library function names start with nc_. To
open a file, use <tt  >nc_open(filename, access_mode,
file_pointer)</tt>. This gives you a file pointer that you can use to
read from and write to the file. You then need to get a variable
identifier with the function <tt  >nc_inq_varid(file_pointer, variable_name,
variable_identifier)</tt>. Now you can actually read in the data with the
function <tt  >nc_get_var_int(file_pointer, variable_identifier,
data_buffer)</tt>,
which will place the data into the data buffer in your code. When you're
done, close the file with
<tt  >nc_close(file_pointer)</tt>. All of
these functions return error codes, and they should be checked after each
execution of a library function. 
</p><p>
Writing files is a little different. You
need to start with <tt  >nc_create</tt>, which gives you a file pointer. You then
define the dimensions with the <tt  >nc_def_dim</tt> function. Once these are
all defined, you can go ahead and create the variables with the 
<tt  >nc_def_var</tt> function. You need to close off the header with
<tt  >nc_enddef</tt>. Finally,
you can start to write out the data itself with
<tt  >nc_put_var_int</tt>. Once
all of the data is written out, you can close the file with
<tt  >nc_close</tt>
</p><p>
The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is another very common file format
used in scientific data processing. It originally was developed at the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and it is now maintained
by the nonprofit HDF Group. All of the libraries and utilities are
released under a BSD-like license. Two options are available:
HDF4 and HDF5. HDF4 supports things like multidimensional arrays, raster
images and tables. You also can create your own grouping structures called
vgroups. The biggest limitation to HDF4 is that file size is limited to
2GB maximum. There also isn't a clear object structure, which limits the
kind of data that can be represented. HDF5 simplifies the file format so
that there are only two types of objects: datasets, which are homogeneous
multidimensional arrays, and groups, which are containers that can hold
datasets or other groups. The libraries have interfaces for C, C++,
FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90 and Java, similar to NetCDF. 
</p><p>
The file starts with
a header, describing details of the file as a whole. Then, it will contain
at least one data descriptor block, describing the details of the data
stored in the file. The file then can contain zero or more data elements,
which contain the actual data itself. A data descriptor block plus a
data element block is represented as a data object. A data descriptor
is 12-bytes long, made up of a 16-bit tag, a 16-bit reference number,
a 32-bit data offset and a 32-bit data length.
</p><p>
Several command-line utilities are available for HDF files too. The
hdp utility is like the ncdump utility. It gives a text dumping of the
file and its data values. hdiff gives you a listing of the differences
between two HDF files. hdfls shows information on the types of data
objects stored in the file. hdfed displays the contents of an HDF file
and gives you limited abilities to edit the contents. You can convert back
and forth between HDF4 and HDF5 with the h4toh5 and h5toh4 utilities. If
you need to compress the data, you can use the hdfpack program. If you
need to alter options, like compression or chunking, you can use hrepack.
</p><p>
The library API for HDF is a bit more complex than for NetCDF. There
is a low-level interface, which is similar to what you would see with
NetCDF. Built on top of this is a whole suite of different interfaces that
give you higher-level functions. For example, there is the scientific data
sets interface, or SD. This provides functions for reading and writing
data arrays. All of the functions begin with SD, such as SDcreate to
create a new file. There are many other interfaces, such as for palettes
(DFP) or 8-bit raster images (DFR8). There are far too many to cover here,
but there is a great deal of information,
including tutorials, that can help you get up to speed with HDF.
</p><p>
Hopefully now that you have seen these two file formats, you can start
to use them in your own research. The key to expanding scientific
understanding is the free exchange of information. And in this age,
that means using common file formats that everyone can use. Now you
can go out and set your data free too.

Although AutoCAD is the champion of the computer-aided design world,
some alternatives are worth looking into. In fact,
even a few open-source options manage to pack some decent
features into an infinitely affordable solution.
</p><p>
QCAD from Ribbonsoft is one of those hybrid programs that has a fully
functional GPL base (the Community Edition) and a commercial application,
which adds functionality for a fee. On Linux, installing QCAD is usually
as easy as a quick trip to your distro's package manager. For
Windows users, however, Ribbonsoft offers source code, but nothing
else. Thankfully, someone over at SourceForge has compiled QCAD for
Windows, and it's downloadable from <a href="http://qcadbin-win.sourceforge.net" target="_self">qcadbin-win.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><p>
For a completely free option, however, FreeCAD might be a better
choice. With binaries available for Windows, OS X and Linux, FreeCAD
is a breeze to distribute. In my very limited field testing, our local
industrial arts teacher preferred FreeCAD over the other open-source
alternatives, but because they're free, you can decide for yourself! Check
out FreeCAD at <a href="http://free-cad.sourceforge.net" target="_self">free-cad.sourceforge.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">Stop Waiting For DNS!</h2>

I am an impulse domain buyer. I tend to purchase silly names for simple
sites that only serve the purpose of an inside joke. The thing about
impulse-buying a domain is that DNS propagation generally takes a day
or so, and setting up a Web site with a virtual hostname can be delayed
while you wait for your Web site address to go &ldquo;live&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Thankfully, there's a simple solution: the /etc/hosts file. By
manually entering the DNS information, you'll get instant access to your new
domain. That doesn't mean it will work for the rest of the Internet
before DNS propagation, but it means you can set up and test your Web site
immediately. Just remember to delete the entry in /etc/hosts after DNS
propagates, or you might end up with a stale entry when your novelty
Web site goes viral and you have to change your Web host!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11295instantf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The format for /etc/hosts is self-explanatory, but you can
add comments by preceding with a # character if desired.

<h2 class="title">Build Your Own Flickr with Piwigo</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #219, July 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In 2006, the family computer on which our digital photographs were stored
had a hard drive failure. Because I'm obsessed with backups, it shouldn't
have been a big deal, except that my backups had been silently failing
for months. Although I certainly learned a lesson about verifying my backups,
I also realized it would be nice to have an off-site storage location
for our photos.
</p><p>
Move forward to 2010, and I realized storing our photos in the
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo;
would mean they were always safe and always accessible. Unfortunately,
it also meant my family memories were stored by someone else, and I had
to pay for the privilege of on-line access. Thankfully, there's an
open-source project designed to fill my family's need, and it's a mature
project that just celebrated its 10th anniversary!
</p><p>
Piwigo, formerly called PhpWebGallery, is a Web-based
program designed to upload, organize and archive photos. It supports
tagging, categories, thumbnails and pretty much every other on-line
sorting tool you can imagine. Piwigo has been around long enough
that there even are third-party applications that support it out of the
box. Want mobile support? The Web site has a mobile theme built in. Want a
native app for your phone? iOS and Android apps are available. In fact,
with its numerous extensions and third-party applications, Piwigo rivals
sites like Flickr and Picasaweb when it comes to flexibility. Plus,
because it's open source, you control all your data.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11295piwigof1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Piwigo supports direct upload of multiple files, but it also
supports third-party upload utilities (screenshot courtesy of
<a href="http://www.piwigo.org" target="_self">www.piwigo.org</a>).
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11295piwigof2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Categories, tags, albums and more are available to organize
your photos (screenshot courtesy of <a href="http://www.piwigo.org" target="_self">www.piwigo.org</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
If you haven't considered Piwigo, you owe it to yourself to try. It's
simple to install, and if you have a recent version of Linux, your
distribution might have it by default in its repositories. Thanks to
its flexibility, maturity and downright awesomeness, Piwigo gets this
month's Editors' Choice award. Check it out today at <a href="http://www.piwigo.org" target="_self">www.piwigo.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Networking Poll</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #219, July 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We recently asked LinuxJournal.com readers about their networking
preferences, and after calculating the results,
we have some interesting findings to report. From a quick glance, we can
see that our readers like their Internet fast,
their computers plentiful and their firewalls simple.
</p><p>
One of the great things about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers and staff is that
we all have a lot in common, and one
of those things is our love of hardware. We like to have a lot of it,
and I suspect we get as much use out of it
as we can before letting go, and thus accumulate a lot of machines in
our houses. When asked how many computers
readers have on their home networks, the answer was, not surprisingly, quite
a few! The most popular answer was
4&ndash;6 computers (44% of readers); 10% of readers have more than 10 computers on their
home networks (I'm impressed); 14% of readers
have 7&ndash;9 running on their networks, and the remaining 32% of readers
have 1&ndash;3 computers
</p><p>
We also asked how many of our surveyed readers
have a dedicated server on their home networks, and a slight majority,
54%, responded yes. I'm pleased to know none of us are slacking on
our home setups in the least!
</p><p>
Understandably, these impressive computing environments need serious
speed. And while the most common Internet connection speed among our
surveyed readers was a relatively low 1&ndash;3mbps (17% of responses),
the majority of our readers connect at relatively fast speeds.
The very close second- and third-most-common speeds were
6&ndash;10mbps and an impressive more than 25mbps, respectively, and each
representing 16% of responses. A similarly large number of surveyed
readers were in the 10&ndash;15mbps and 15&ndash;25mbps ranges, so we're glad
to know so many of you are getting the most out of your Internet
experience.
</p><p>
The vast majority of our readers use cable and DSL Internet services.
Cable was the slight leader at 44% vs. 41% for DSL. And 12% of readers have a
fiber connection&mdash;and to the mountain-dwelling Canadian reader connected via long-range
Wi-Fi 8km away, I salute you! Please send us photos of your view.
</p><p>
The favorite wireless access point vendor is clearly Linksys, with 30%
of survey readers using some type of Linksys device. NETGEAR and
D-Link have a few fans as well, each getting 15% of the delicious response
pie.
And more than a handful of you pointed out that you do not use any
wireless Internet. I admit, I'm intrigued.
</p><p>
Finally, when asked about your preferred firewall software/appliance,
the clear winner was &ldquo;Stock Router/AP Firmware&rdquo; with 41% of
respondents
indicating this as their preferred method. We respect your tendency to
keep it simple. In a distant second place, with 15%, was a custom
Linux solution, which is not surprising given our readership's
penchant for customization in all things.
</p><p>
Thanks to all who participated, and please look to
LinuxJournal.com for future polls and surveys.
