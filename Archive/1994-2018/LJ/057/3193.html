    Ready to create your own virtual community? Here's how to
    begin.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1308580.0x1400450"></a></h2></div></div><p>For a period of time last year, the
buzzword on the Web was &ldquo;community&rdquo;. Everyone wanted to build a
virtual community, allowing people to interact on-line in much the
same way as they interact in real life.
</p><p>While virtual communities were (and are) overhyped, it is
true that the Internet has produced a number of such on-line
groups, many of whose members have never met in person. If you're
reading this magazine, you probably participate in at least one
e-mail list, chat system or Usenet newsgroup. Indeed, Linux would
probably not be the success it is today were it not for communities
of developers and users sharing information with each other via the
Internet.</p><p>Several methods are available for creating an on-line
community, beginning with the oldest and best-known, an e-mail
list. Setting up a mailing list is relatively easy, and only
minimal resources are necessary to keep a list running. Another
popular option is a Usenet newsgroup, which uses a similar format
but a different distribution mechanism than e-mail.</p><p>Still another option is a web-based bulletin board system.
While such systems are neither as flexible nor as powerful as
Usenet or e-mail lists, they do offer a number of advantages. They
are resistant to spam, can be easily integrated into other aspects
of a web site and give visitors to the web site a chance to
participate in discussion without having to register. Many
commercial web sites now offer bulletin boards for their users, in
the hopes of turning their site into a truly interactive and
two-way experience, rather than another distribution medium for
their content.</p><p>Starting in this issue, we will take a three-part look at how
to create a simple bulletin board system of our own. This project
was suggested by reader Dwight Johnson and also influenced by my
creation of an &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; home page that will include
examples of the programs presented in these columns, as well as a
central place for readers to discuss the programs.</p><p>This month, we will look at the basic guts of the bulletin
board system to be used on the ATF site. As you will see, I have
decided to keep the software and the BBS very simple, without
certain advanced features such as hierarchies and threading.
However, it should not be difficult to add these features to the
software, or to use this as a base for a more advanced system. Next
month, we will add enough features to make this a serviceable BBS.
Finally, in the third part of this series, we will look at ways in
which we can add a number of useful features to the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1308580.0x1400710"></a>Designing the BBS</h2></div></div><p>The first consideration is the look and feel of the BBS,
since that will force our hand on a number of other issues. As I
indicated above, it is my goal to keep this software as simple as
possible. I decided to keep discussions in a non-hierarchical
manner. Each message belongs to a single thread within the BBS. We
will not keep track of replies or allow sub-threads. Messages
within a thread will be presented in chronological order, from the
newest message to the oldest.</p><p>The user will thus have several possible options at any given
point: starting a new thread, posting a new message to an existing
thread, listing the current threads, or looking through the
messages in one thread.</p><p>While I briefly considered storing messages in ASCII text
files, I quickly decided to use a relational database. A database
makes it easier to handle future expansion, since more features can
be provided by adding one or more columns to a table. Databases
also free us from having to worry about file formats, locking and
other problems which inevitably occur when we use ASCII text
files.</p><p>My database of choice is the &ldquo;mostly free&rdquo; MySQL. The
programs will be written in Perl and will use Perl's database
interface, known as DBI. See the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; sidebar for pointers
to information about any or all of these.</p><p>If you have been following this column over the last few
months, you may be surprised to see that I have implemented it
using simple CGI programs. I could have used mod_perl, a module
that embeds a Perl binary inside of the Apache HTTP server. I could
also have used HTML::Embperl, the templating language we explored
in this column's previous two installments.</p><p>However, reality is often the compelling factor and the web
space provider I use has not yet installed mod_perl. These programs
should run just fine under Apache::Registry, the modules for
mod_perl that provide emulation of the CGI standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1308580.0x14009d0"></a>Creating the Tables</h2></div></div><p>If we are going to store information in a relational
database, the first technical decision involves the database
itself. What information do we want to store, and how do we want to
store it?</p><p>Because we are storing messages and threads, I designed the
system with two tables, ATFThreads and ATFMessages. Each message,
including information about the author and the posting date, is
stored in ATFMessages. Each message in the table points to a single
thread in ATFThreads, allowing us to sort messages by
thread.</p><p>Here, for instance, is the definition of ATFThreads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE ATFThreads (
    id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT
        PRIMARY KEY,
    subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(subject)
 );
</pre><p>Each thread is stored in a single row of the database,
uniquely identified by its <b  >id</b> column, which we
define to be a <b  >SMALLINT UNSIGNED</b>. (We are thus
allowed 65,535 different topics, which should suffice for now.) By
declaring the column to be AUTO_INCREMENT, we are asking MySQL to
give the <b  >id</b> column a new value each time we
insert a new row. By declaring it to be the PRIMARY KEY, we
indicate that the <b  >id</b> column will uniquely
identify a row.
</p><p>The other columns are fairly self-explanatory:
<b  >subject</b> contains the subject of the thread,
while <b  >author</b> and <b  >email</b>
contain the thread creator's name and e-mail address,
respectively.</p><p>Each thread has an opening message that starts the
discussion; it is stored in the <b  >text</b> column in a
column of type <b  >TEXT</b>. <b  >TEXT</b>
fields can contain amounts of text larger than the 255-character
maximum given to us by <b  >VARCHAR</b> columns.
<b  >VARCHAR</b> columns are stripped of trailing
whitespace, sparing us from at least one housekeeping chore when
working with the database.</p><p>Finally, we give each thread a <b  >date</b> column
in which we record the creation date and time with a
<b  >DATETIME</b> element. We also ensure that the
human-readable subject line for the thread is unique with the
<b  >UNIQUE</b> keyword at the end of the table
definition. This prevents us from having two threads named
&ldquo;Problems with MySQL&rdquo;, for example.</p><p>Now that we have seen how to create ATFThreads, we can define
ATFMessages. The two are quite similar, the main difference being a
reference to a thread ID:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE ATFMessages (
    id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT
        PRIMARY KEY,
    thread SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
        "No subject",
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
        "Mr. Nobody",
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
        "atf@lerner.co.il",
    text TEXT NOT NULL
 );
</pre><p>Once again, we create a column with an auto-incrementing
primary key named <b  >id</b>. Different tables can have
identically named keys just as different hashes can. If we are
referring to both tables in a single query, we can distinguish
between the two by using the <b  >table.column</b>
syntax, as in <b  >ATFMessages.id</b> and
<b  >ATFThreads.id</b>.
</p><p>Notice how we have used the <b  >DEFAULT</b>
keyword to assign default values to each of the elements. Truth be
told, the way the database-handling programs are written makes it
unlikely we will ever see these defaults. (Empty strings are passed
to the database as empty strings, rather than as NULL values. To
get a true NULL, we must pass an undefined scalar.) However, it is
always a good idea to build multiple checks into your programs just
in case one of the other levels does not work in the way you
expected. This can also help us track down problems; if we notice
that many users are identified as &ldquo;Mr. Nobody&rdquo;, we can assume
something has gone wrong with our posting software.</p><p>We can create the tables by entering the above SQL commands
at the interactive <span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span> prompt.
Once they have been created, we are ready to start working on the
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1308580.0x1401630"></a>Common Program Elements</h2></div></div><p>The programs in this project share a number of elements. Each
starts with a series of <b  >use</b> statements:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use strict;
use diagnostics;
use CGI;
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
use DBI;
</pre><p>The first, <b  >use&nbsp;strict</b>, prods us into
making our variable references explicit, either by creating them as
lexicals (with the <b  >my</b> statement) or with the
<b  >use vars</b> statement. I have chosen to create all
variables as lexicals, but if you were interested in putting common
variable definitions into an external file, you might want to
consider making them globals.
</p><p>Next, we invoke <b  >use diagnostics</b>, which
tells Perl to give us information from the
<span   class="bold"><b>perldiag</b></span> manual page if and when
there are problems with our program. I find <b  >use
diagnostics</b> to be an invaluable debugging tool when
working with web applications, since it often points to a foolish
mistake I have made. This, along with
<b  >use&nbsp;strict</b> and the <b  >-w</b>
flag, makes programming in Perl much less error-prone.</p><p>We then load the <b  >CGI::Carp</b> module, which
overrides the built-in <b  >Carp</b> module with routines
of its own that make for more accurate messages in our HTTP
server's error log. We also import
<b  >CGI::Carp::fatalsToBrowser</b>, which sends an error
message to the user's browser if and when an error occurs. This
allows us to use the standard <b  >die</b> statement
without having to worry about whether we have already sent the HTTP
&ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header. Sending a message to the user's browser
without such a header almost always causes an error message to be
displayed.</p><p>Each program in the BBS also defines a number of variables:
<b  >$database</b>, <b  >$server</b>,
<b  >$port</b>, <b  >$username</b> and
<b  >$password</b>. These variables are used to log into
the database with DBI; by setting them at the top of the program,
you can modify them as necessary without having to change
hard-coded strings.</p><p>Each program also turns off buffering, so that information is
sent to the user's browser as soon as the program sends it to the
appropriate file handle. Normally, saying</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print "&lt;P&gt;Hello&lt;/P&gt;";
</pre><p>does not send <b  >&lt;P&gt;Hello&lt;/P&gt;</b> to
the user's browser. Rather, it places the string in a buffer. When
the buffer is filled, its contents are shipped off to the user's
browser. This is more efficient, since the computer can copy a lot
of data at once, rather than spending its time entering and exiting
from the routines that handle file operations. However, it also
means the user must wait to see results. We can turn off buffering
by setting the built-in Perl variable <b  >$|</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$| = 1;
</pre>


Finally, each program connects to the database with the standard
DBI routine:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $dbh =
 DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$server:$port",
 $username, $password);
</pre>


If the connection succeeds, we receive a database handle (dbh) in
return and store it in <b  >$dbh</b>. If
<b  >$dbh</b> is false, however, we should report an
error, since it means the connection did not work:
<pre     class="programlisting">
die "DBI error from connect:", $DBI::errstr
    unless $dbh;
</pre>


We can do the same thing when preparing a query. The result from
<b  >$dbh-&gt;prepare</b> is a statement handle (sth).
When defined, <b  >$sth</b> is an object that itself
accepts methods. When <b  >$sth</b> is undefined, the
statement preparation failed:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
die "DBI error with prepare: ", $sth-&gt;errstr
    unless $sth;
</pre>


We can execute our statement with
<b  >$sth-&gt;execute</b>, which works in much the same
way as <b  >$dbh-&gt;prepare</b>. The difference is that
the result code is a simple value, rather than an object:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $result = $sth-&gt;execute;
</pre>


In some programs, we test the value of <b  >$result</b>
and use <span   class="bold"><b>die</b></span> to report an error:
<pre     class="programlisting">
die "DBI error with execute: ", $sth-&gt;errstr
    unless $result;
</pre>


In others, we use <b  >$result</b> to decide whether to
continue with the program or to print a more user-friendly error
message:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if ($result)
{   # do something
}
else
{   # indicate an error
}
</pre>


Finally, we always disconnect from the database at the end of our
programs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh-&gt;disconnect;
</pre>


This is not truly necessary, since DBI and Perl close all such
connections when the program exits. However, if you are running
with <b  >-w</b>, a message will be inserted into your
error log each time a program exits without disconnecting from the
database nicely. We do this in order to keep our error log free of
spurious details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1308580.0x13f8ff0"></a>Creating and Viewing Threads</h2></div></div><p>Since each message must belong to a thread, we will first
look at how a thread is created. A thread is no more than a single
row in the ATFThreads table, so our thread-creation program will be
fairly simple.</p><p>The three listings referred to in this article are available
for anonymous download at
<a href="../listings/057/3193.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue57/3193.tgz</a>.
They are not printed here due to space considerations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Add-thread.pl</b></span> (Listing 1 in
the archive file) uses the contents of an HTML form to insert a new
row into ATFThreads. However, it performs some additional
manipulation as well, to ensure that the data will be retrievable
in a useful way.</p><p>We can use either single or double quotes around text strings
in SQL queries. Double quotes are used by DBI for parameters and
thus exclude the possibility of using quotation marks. We therefore
use single quotes around our text strings. However, this raises the
issue of how to pass single quotes to the program. A simple
solution is to perform a substitution on each of the text strings
generated by the user. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$value{"subject"} = $query-&gt;param("subject");
$value{"subject"} =~ s/\'/\'\'/g;
</pre><p>We can do even better by using the built-in
<b  >$dbh-&gt;quote</b> method, which quotes a text
string for us. <b  >$dbh-&gt;quote</b> decides whether to
use single or double quotes and also handles special characters,
such as quotation marks and question marks, with ease. We use a
<span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> loop to quote each of the
elements:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Get the form parameters
foreach my $element (qw(subject text author
    email))
{
$value{$element} =
    $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param($element));
}
</pre>


Once we have done this, we can be sure that
<b  >$value{$element}</b> is suitable for insertion into
the database.
</p><p>We also perform several substitutions on the &ldquo;text&rdquo; HTML
element, which contains the text that starts the thread. To begin,
we remove all HTML tags, so as to prevent people from linking to
all sorts of crazy sites. While it might be desirable to allow
people to include HTML in their postings, it could also lead to
chaos if formatting commands were inserted. I decided to be
slightly draconian and disallowed all HTML. We do that by removing
everything between <b  >&lt;</b> and
<b  >&gt;</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$text =~ s/&lt;.*?&gt;//sg;
</pre><p>Notice how we use Perl's non-greedy operator
<b  >*?</b> instead of <b  >*</b> to remove the
HTML tag. If we were to use <b  >*</b> and the line had
two HTML tags, Perl would remove everything from the first
<b  >&lt;</b> through the final <b  >&gt;</b>.
We use the <b  >/s</b> modifier to tell Perl that
<b  >.</b> includes all characters, including new lines.
Without <b  >/s</b>, <b  >\n</b> would not be
included in <b  >.</b>, which means a two-line tag such
as
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;a
 href="http://www.cnn.com/"&gt;
</pre>


would be ignored.
</p><p>We then make sure new lines are treated correctly, first
removing multiple new lines and then replacing them with HTML
paragraph markers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$text =~ s/\r\n/\n/g;
$text =~ s/\r/\n/g;
$text =~ s|\n\n|&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;\P&gt;|gi;
</pre><p>Once it has performed all of these tasks, add-thread.pl
creates the SQL query that will insert the new thread into
ATFThreads:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "INSERT INTO ATFThreads ";
$sql .= " (subject, text, author, email, date) ";
$sql .= "VALUES ($values, NOW())";
</pre>


We insert the date of the thread for future use, but also so that
we can sort the threads in the order of their creation.
</p><p>The program which lists threads, appropriately named
<span   class="bold"><b>list-threads.pl</b></span> (Listing 2 in the
archive file), uses a SELECT query to retrieve all of the rows from
ATFThreads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql =
"SELECT id,subject FROM ATFThreads ORDER BY subject";
</pre><p>After performing an <b  >$sth-&gt;execute</b>, it
checks to see how many rows were returned. If none were returned,
we indicate that no threads have yet been created. If threads
exist, we iterate through the results with
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b>, which places the query result
into <b  >@row</b>. We can pull out the elements of
<b  >@row</b> and print a list:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if ($sth-&gt;rows)
{
print "&lt;ul&gt;\n";
while (my @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow)
{
 print "&lt;li&gt; ";
 print "&lt;a href=\"/cgi-bin/view-thread.pl?";
 print "$row[0]\"&gt;$row[1]&lt;/a&gt;\n";
}
print "&lt;/ul&gt;\n";
$sth-&gt;finish;
}
</pre>


Users are presented with an alphabetical list of thread titles,
each of which is a hyperlink to
<span   class="bold"><b>view-thread.pl</b></span> (Listing 3 in the
archive file), described below. As you can see, the argument to
view-thread.pl is the <b  >id</b> value of the thread,
the defined primary key.
