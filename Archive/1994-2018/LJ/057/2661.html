    Mr. Stutz introduces us to a digital method for keeping
    track of appointments and those important dates in our
    lives.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1149580.0x1241450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I am obsessive about keeping track of
things. I used to get a free calendar each year from the local
phone company. It was the perfect interface for all my
appointments&mdash;a slim, spiral-bound calendar that I kept on my
desktop and used to record any upcoming appointments, as well as
mark the birthdays of my friends and family. Every year around the
holidays I'd get a new calendar and dutifully re-transcribe the
birthdays and other annual appointments into the new calendar.
</p><p>A few years ago, the phone company decided to stop sending
out these free calendars, but fortunately I had found a better way.
By using <span   class="bold"><b>cal</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>calendar</b></span> programs, I can leave all
my old analog date books behind.</p><p>Different versions of these utilities exist. Originally part
of the BSD utilities, a GNU version called
<span   class="bold"><b>gcal</b></span> with some advanced features
has been released. I will focus this tutorial on the original BSD
programs since they're widely available, as well as mention some
other related programs at the end of the article.</p><p>You'll first want to find out if you have these programs
installed on your system by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
which cal
</pre><p>If <span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> returns a full
pathname of the <span   class="bold"><b>cal</b></span> program, it is
installed. If instead you are immediately returned to a shell
prompt, then you will need to obtain and install this program. You
can use <span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> again to see if you
have the <span   class="bold"><b>calendar</b></span> program
installed as well; they are different programs and you will need
them both.
</p><p>If you use the Debian distribution of Linux, both programs
are available in the <span   class="bold"><b>bsdmainutils</b></span>
package. Otherwise, consult your distribution, or search the Linux
Software Map at http://www.linuxresources.com/apps.html.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1149580.0x1241a28"></a>Using Calendar</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar</b></span> is a basic reminder
service. It reads a file called calendar in the current directory
and prints lines which start with today's or tomorrow's dates. The
calendar file is a text file that can be created and edited with
any text editor.</p><p>This program is more powerful than it may seem at first. The
general format for a calendar file entry is the month and day to
the immediate left, followed by a tab and the reminder text. The
month and day can be skipped&mdash;each line beginning with a tab
carries the same month and day value as the line preceding
it.</p><p>There is quite a varied syntax for the month and day. To
demonstrate, let's make up a sample calendar file and look at it
line by line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
10/31   Johnny's Halloween party
Friday  Garbage day
Nov. 20 Dentist appointment, 9:30am
20/11   Mandatory staff meeting, 10:00am
January Happy new year!
        Have you made your resolutions yet?
18 *    Rent's due
</pre><p>Let's imagine that today is Friday, October 31, 1997. At the
shell prompt, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
calendar
</pre>


With the sample calendar file in your current directory, you will
see this output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
10/31   Johnny's Halloween party
Friday  Garbage day
</pre>


The <b  >10/31</b> in the first line tells calendar to
print that line if it is October 31 (or the day before), and the
<b  >Friday</b> in the second line tells it to print (you
guessed it) every Friday.
</p><p>As you can see, you can also use an abbreviated form of
writing out the month, as in the example line starting with
<b  >Nov. 20</b>. Now, on the fourth line, the mm/dd
format is reversed&mdash;in this case, calendar figures that out and
will print it on the 20th day of November. It's probably not a good
idea to keep records in this format. If you were to write May 10th
as 10/5, calendar will assume you mean the U.S. convention of mm/dd
and print that entry on October 5th.</p><p>If you have just the name of a month in the first column,
calendar will print the entry on the first of that month. If you
eliminate that column altogether by inserting a tab and some
reminder text, calendar will print the line on the date of the
preceding entry. Thus, on New Year's Day, our example calendar will
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
January Happy new year!
        Have you made your resolutions yet?
</pre><p>Finally, substituting an asterisk for the month will print
that entry on the stated date each month. In our example, a
reminder to pay the rent will be displayed on the eighteenth of
each month.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1149580.0x1242000"></a>Keeping Your Dates Separate</h2></div></div><p>Since it is pre-processed by
<span   class="bold"><b>cpp</b></span>, the C preprocessor, calendar
recognizes include files. This allows you to keep and use special
lists, such as a personal list of birthdays, without cluttering up
your main calendar file. The calendar program comes with a set of
such files in /usr/lib/calendar/ to get you started:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.birthday</b></span>:
birth and death dates of many famous historical figures</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.computer</b></span>:
important dates in the history of computing</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.holiday</b></span>:
known (and not-so-well-known) holidays</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.music</b></span>:
important dates in music, especially mainstream rock-n-roll</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.christian</b></span>:
Christian holidays</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.history</b></span>:
many historical events</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.judaic</b></span>:
Jewish holidays</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>calendar.usholiday</b></span>:
standard US holidays</p></li></ul></div><p>When you use an include statement, calendar first searches
the directory it was called in, and then looks in
/usr/lib/calendar/. Including this line in your file,
<pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;calendar.usholiday&gt;
</pre>


means calendar will first look in the current directory for such a
file. If not present, it will then check /usr/lib/calendar/, and if
the appropriate file is found, include it.
</p><p>One of the functions of my old paper calendar was to record
and keep a record of important events in my life. I was able to
reproduce this function by keeping this information in files named
calendar.yyyy, such as calendar.1997. Looking through the files in
order gives me a chronological record of major events in my life,
and if I ever wanted to see what I was doing around today's date in
a certain year or years, I could add include statements for the
appropriate calendar.yyyy files in my calendar file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1149580.0x1242b00"></a>Automating Calendar</h2></div></div><p>You can run calendar whenever you like, but it might be more
useful to put it in your profile file (~/.bash_profile if you use
the bash shell). Then calendar will run each time you log in to the
system.</p><p>I keep my personal calendar file in the doc/etc/ subdirectory
of my home directory, so I would include the following line in my
profile:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/m/doc/etc/; calendar; cd
</pre><p>Putting the same line in your .bashrc file (again, only if
you use the bash shell&mdash;others are different) also works to run
calendar each time you start a shell.
</p><p>Sometimes even <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> isn't enough&mdash;if
your machine is on all the time and you haven't been starting any
new shells or xterms, you might miss a reminder. So you could
schedule a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job to run
calendar each day, e-mailing the output to you as a
reminder.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1149580.0x163b068"></a>Using cal</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>cal</b></span> program displays a
text calendar. If you call it without any options by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cal
</pre><p>the current month will be displayed on the terminal like this
(assuming September, 1998):
<pre     class="programlisting">
  September 1998
 S  M Tu  W Th  F  S
       1  2  3  4  5
 6  7  8  9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30
</pre>


It's pretty no-frills, but can work on any terminal. To get a
calendar of the whole year, call cal with the year as argument.
<pre     class="programlisting">
cal 1950
</pre>


Typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cal -y
</pre>


will print a calendar for the current year.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cal</b></span> can also display any
arbitrary month. If you want to see the month of December 1999, for
instance, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cal 12 1999
</pre><p>in which case you'll see:
<pre     class="programlisting">
December 1999
 S  M Tu  W Th  F  S
          1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31
</pre>

sometimes when printing you might want a nicer output.
<span   class="bold"><b>pcal</b></span> is a program that creates
very nice calendars in PostScript. Its options are very similar to
that of cal. It is available from
http://garbo.uwasa.fi/unix/pcal.html.</p><p>Other programs that handle calendar functions in a more
graphically-intense way (and can be used only in X) include
<span   class="bold"><b>ical</b></span>, at
http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Sanjay_Ghemawat/ical/home.html
and <span   class="bold"><b>plan</b></span>, found at
http://www.in-berlin.de/User/bitrot/plan.html. There are many
variants of the basic UNIX calendar programs&mdash;check the Linux
Software Map for more.</p><p>With this overview of the power and flexibility of these
simple calendar programs, you too can leave your analog calendar
systems behind.</p></div></div>
