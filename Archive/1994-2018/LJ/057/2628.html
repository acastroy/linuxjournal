    Improve your users' browsing and save your bandwidth by
    using proxy servers to cache web pages.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f3580.0x13eb500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The web is everywhere. Everyone uses it.
Everyone talks about it. But in this less-than-perfect world, you
know there are problems. Bandwidth is a problem. Web document
latency (the time a document takes to arrive at your browser once
its URL is requested) is a problem. As more of your bandwidth space
is used, latency of documents retrieved from the Internet
increases. Bandwidth is expensive, perhaps the most expensive
element of an Internet connection.
</p><p>Despite the fact that the web is growing fast, the same
documents get requested and the same web sites are visited
repeatedly. We can take advantage of this to avoid downloading
redundant objects. You would be surprised to learn how many of your
users read the NBA.COM web pages, or how many times the GIFs from
AltaVista cross your line.</p><p>Even if you know nothing about web caching, you are probably
using it with your web browser. Most common browsers use this
approach with the documents and objects you retrieve from the Web,
keeping a copy of recent documents in memory or disk. Each time you
click on the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button or visit the same page, that page is
in memory and does not need to be retrieved. This is the first
level of caching, and the technique can be expanded to the entire
web.</p><p>The basic idea behind caching is to store the documents
retrieved by one user in a common location, and thus avoid
retrieving the same document for a second user from its source.
Instead, the second user gets the document from the common place.
This is very important when you deal with organizations in Europe,
where most of the inbound traffic comes from the other side of the
Atlantic, frequently across slow links.</p><p>The main benefit of this approach is the fact that your
users' browsing is now collaborative, and an important number of
the documents your users retrieve are served in a very small period
of time. In a medium-sized organization (with between 50 to 100
users), you can serve up to 60% of URL requests from the local
cache.</p><p>The difference between a browser cache and a proxy-cache
server is that the browser cache works for only one user and is
located in the final user workstation, while the proxy-cache server
is a program that acts on behalf of a number of web browser
clients, allowing one client to read documents requested by others
earlier. This proxy-cache server is located in a common server that
usually lies between the local network and the Internet. All
browsers request documents from the proxy server, which retrieves
the documents and returns them to the browsers. It's the second
level of caching in an organization. Figure 1 shows this type of
network configuration.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2628f1.large.jpg"><img src="2628f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Proxy-cache Server Network Configuration

</p></div></div><p>A proxy-cache is not just a solution to the bandwidth crisis;
it is also desirable when a network firewall is needed to guarantee
the security of your organization. In this case, the proxy-cache
sits on a computer accessible from all local browsers, but isolates
them from the Internet at the same time. This computer must have
two network interfaces attached to the internal and external
networks and must be the only computer reachable from the Internet.
Figure 2 illustrates such a configuration. The proxy-cache server
must be accessible only by internal systems to ensure that no one
on the Internet can access your internal documents by requesting
them from the proxy-cache. I will discuss access control to the
proxy-cache later in this article.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2628f2.large.jpg"><img src="2628f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

hierarchy, where two or more proxy-cache servers cooperate by
serving documents to each other. A proxy-cache can play two
different roles in a hierarchy, depending on network topology, ISP
policies and system resources. A neighbor (or sibling) cache is one
that serves only documents it already has. A parent cache can get
documents from another cache higher in the hierarchy or from the
source, depending whether it has more parent or neighbor caches in
its level. A parent cache should be used when there are no more
opportunities to get the document from a cache on the same
level.</p><p>Choosing a good cache topology is very important in order to
avoid generating more network traffic than without web caching. An
organization can choose to have several sibling caches in its
departmental networks and a parent cache close to the network link
to the Internet. This parent cache can be configured to request
documents from another parent cache in the upstream ISP, in case
they have one (most do). Agreements can be made between
organizations and ISPs to build sibling or parent caches to reduce
traffic overload in their links, or to route web traffic through a
different path than the regular IP traffic. Web caching can be
considered an application-level, routing mechanism, which uses ICP
(Internet Cache Protocol) as its main protocol. Figure 3 is an
example of how an organization can implement multi-level web
caching.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2628f3.large.jpg"><img src="2628f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Multi-level Web Caching Organization

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f3580.0x13ebea0"></a>What's ICP?</h2></div></div><p>ICP, Internet Cache Protocol, is a protocol used for
communicating among web caches. A lightweight protocol built on top
of UDP, ICP is used to locate specific web objects in neighboring
caches. Most transfers of objects between caches are done with the
TCP-based HTTP protocol, but making the decision of where to
retrieve an object must be done with a simpler and faster
mechanism. Other information needed is which caches are down or
have congested links.</p><p>One cache, in order to find the best location from which to
download an object, sends an ICP request packet to all of its
siblings and parent caches, and they send back ICP replies with a
HIT or MISS code. A HIT code means this cache has the object and
agrees to serve it. A MISS code means it doesn't have the object.
Thus, the cache now knows who has the object it needs, and,
combining this information with other factors such as round-trip
times of each response, can perform the cache selection and make
the request via HTTP to its choice. If all the caches reply with
MISS packets, it requests the document from its parent cache. An
ICP request/reply exchange should occur in a second or two, so the
latency increases this time for the browser, but this is usually
not noticed by the end user.</p><p>If the object requested via ICP is small enough, it can be
included in the ICP HIT reply, like an HTTP redirect, but this is
not a very common situation. Of course, ICP is needed only in a
multi-level cache environment with multiple siblings and parent
caches. Using ICP is not necessary in situations like the ones in
Figures 1 and 2. When only one cache is involved, or when one cache
always requests documents from the same higher-level cache, ICP
would only add unwanted overhead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f3580.0x13ec058"></a>To cache or not to cache?</h2></div></div><p>At this point, we must realize that not all objects in the
web are cacheables. Most FTP files are, as well as most static web
pages, but a large number of CGI-generated web pages (dynamic
documents) are not. This kind of document is non-cacheable, because
it is different each time you request it. Two good examples of this
kind of object are access counters and live database queries.
Caching a reply from a flight reservation system is senseless,
since the next query will most likely return more up-to-date
values. Other kinds of documents which should not be cached include
SSL documents (securely transmitted documents).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f3580.0x13ec160"></a>OK, cache, but for how long?</h2></div></div><p>Even if you do not have a proxy-cache server, you must be
aware of the effects other proxy-cache servers are causing on the
Internet. You may be publishing information on your web server that
other caches are storing and serving for more time than you
probably want. This is particularly true if you periodically update
your site and it's important to you that a final user never gets
out-of-date pages or graphics.</p><p>A document in a cache server can have three different states:
FRESH, NORMAL and STALE. When an object is FRESH, it is served
normally when a request for it arrives without checking the source
to see if the object has been modified since its last retrieval. If
it's in NORMAL state, an <b  >If-Modified-Since GET</b>
request is sent to the source, so the cache server downloads the
object from the source only if it has changed since its last
retrieval. A STALE document is no longer valid, and it's retrieved
from the source again.</p><p>Normally, when a web server sends a document, it adds an HTTP
header called Last-Modified containing the date the object was
created or last modified. This data is used by cache servers to
heuristically calculate how much time may pass for the object to
still be considered FRESH. Usually, a proportion of the time
elapsed between the date the document was last modified and the
date when the document was received is used. A normal proportion is
10% to 30% of this time. If this proportion is set to 20%, a
document modified 10 days ago will remain in the cache only two
days before being checked for changes.</p><p>Webmasters who frequently update their information need more
control over the time their documents remain unchecked in web
caches. In this case, the Expires HTTP header in the documents
served by your server can be used to indicate when this document
must be dropped by any cache server. This header explicitly gives
the caches the expiration date of a document. A valid RFC1123 time
format should be used with this header, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Expires: Mon, 25 Aug 1997 10:00:00 GMT
</pre><p>This header can be generated easily in CGI scripts or the
mod_expires module included in Apache 1.2. For example, the
following Apache directives (in a &lt;Directory&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt; or a .htaccess) would do it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresByType image/gif A432000
ExpiresByType image/jpeg A432000
ExpiresByType text/html A10800
</pre>


The Expires header is activated for all subsequent documents with a
value of five days for JPEG and GIF images and three hours for HTML
documents.
</p><p>If you have documents which should never be cached in any
server or browser, use the HTTP header called:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Pragma: no-cache
</pre><p>Of course, a cache may expire an object sooner, based on site
configuration, lack of free disk space, LRU (less recently used)
policies, etc., but it can never cache an object beyond its
<b  >Expires</b> time.
</p><p>Next month, we will discuss Squid, the best free software
solution for building proxy-cache servers.</p><p><a href="2628s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
