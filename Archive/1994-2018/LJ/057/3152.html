Corporation's founder, CEO and President; he also serves as
Chairman of the Board for Corel Computer Corporation. Prior to
founding Corel in 1985, Michael worked for over 20 years in
communications and computing, first as a design engineer at Bell
Northern Research (now Northern Telecom), then as manager of
circuit design for Microsystems International, and finally as
co-founder and president of Mitel, a leader in the telephony,
computer telephony integration (CTI) and communications industries.
I interviewed Michael by e-mail in October 1998.
</p><p>Corel Corporation, headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, develops
software technologies for the business, graphics and Web markets.
Recognized for excellence through industry awards and consumer
loyalty, Corel products rank among the highest in the
industry.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What event first
brought Linux to your attention?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: In the last two
years, Linux has truly emerged as a viable market opportunity.
Linux was the only non-Microsoft OS to gain market share in 1997.
The Linux user base now exceeds seven million worldwide and all
indicators show continuing growth.</p><p>Corel has been shipping Corel WordPerfect for UNIX for many
years. We began to hear from a large Linux user base that they
wanted a native Linux port.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What sort of
evaluation procedures did you use to decide to support
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: The number of Linux
users has doubled annually for the past few years&mdash;growing from
half a million users in 1994 to about 7 million this year. For many
users, Linux is a viable alternative to the various Windows
platforms.</p><p>Linux, because of its technical merits, won the hearts and
minds of developers and programmers many years ago. Because of its
stability, cost and openness, a large number of institutions,
governments and medium-sized businesses have been using Linux as a
network operating system for the past couple of years. More
recently, home-based technical enthusiasts have been using Linux
because of the growing number of features and programs the OS has
to offer in addition to its stability, security and
openness.</p><p>Linux offers the general computer user an excellent
alternative. However, the typical consumer looking at Linux is
waiting for an easy-to-use, easy-to-learn operating system that
runs familiar commercial applications. This is the opportunity for
Corel to bring a set of premiere applications to a mass market
demanding products that run on the highly stable, 32-bit,
multitasking operating system, Linux.</p><p>The number of Linux requests continues to grow rapidly every
month. Other large companies like Oracle, Netscape and Informix
have begun to support Linux, and it is grabbing the attention of
the mainstream and computer trade press.</p><p>Support for Linux also fits well with Corel's mission
statement to focus our technology leadership and offer customers
value, compatibility and choice.</p><p>This support also aligns with development work being done at
Corel Computer division, on its NetWinder family of Linux-powered
thin clients and thin server products. The reason the NetWinder is
based on Linux is because it is the best technology to accomplish
Corel Computer's goals. Corel Computer is taking a leading role in
the promotion of open standards, thin client and server computing
and the cooperative software development model, having announced in
May 1998 that it will make the source code to the Linux portion of
its NetWinder operating system available. By selecting Linux as its
operating system, Corel Computer is providing cost-effective,
value-added alternatives to customers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What advantages do
you see in having products that support Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Corel sees
customers wanting a new and much-needed choice of operating
systems. We also believe Linux to be very stable, and providing our
customers with a better environment on which to run Corel
applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
Disadvantages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: There is still some
fragmentation in the Linux community with respect to the various
distributions. Installation formats are still not standardized and
are usually too cryptic for adoption into the computer
mainstream.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you find
most attractive about Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Linux offers
customers stability, freedom and speed. The concrete reasons why
Linux has millions of supporters, including Corel, is because it
is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Highly stable</p></li><li><p>Robust</p></li><li><p>Multitasking and multithreading</p></li><li><p>A small footprint</p></li><li><p>Supported by thousands of developers
worldwide</p></li></ul></div><p>Corel views Linux as an up-and-coming operating system for
innovators and power users in the computer industry. We see
innovation in Linux where we have seen a slowdown in innovation in
the computer mainstream for the past few years.
</p><p>Linux also offers some benefits that go beyond technology.
Primarily, it is a highly accessible operating system. Not only is
it freely available, but the users and developers have access to
the best technology as soon as they need it, not when a big
software developer gets around to releasing the next upgrade. For
example, when Corel Computer decided to use the StrongARM
processor, Linux was the only serious OS that had binaries
available for this chip.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How do you compare
Linux with other operating systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: We see Linux as a
more powerful and stable operating system than Windows 95 and
Windows NT. However, the Linux community still has to deliver
better user interfaces for configuration and both application and
OS installation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What other
platforms do you support?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Corel presently
offers its award-winning Corel WordPerfect on numerous operating
systems including Linux, UNIX, Macintosh, DOS, Open VMS and various
Windows platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you plan to
support Linux with all your products? If not, why not?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: We are studying the
market demand and opportunity. We are working to provide the main
applications to the Linux community for the initial development
phase. After the market begins to mature and attract more early
adopters, then we will move to add other applications which are not
as critical to the majority of Linux users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us about the
products you have ported to Linux and why you chose to port
them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Corel beleives a
word processor is the first priority for a typical Linux user.
WordPerfect was the application for which we received the largest
number of user requests. WordPerfect 7 was available first, and
Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux will ship in late 1998. We will be
putting a major effort into porting our office suite and graphics
line of products to Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you think
needs to be added to Linux to make it more attractive to business
users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: Several issues need
to be resolved before corporations will begin to officially adopt
Linux. Application installations must be improved and standardized.
The operating system installations must be improved. Distributions
must unify and adopt standards for installations, desktops,
windowing systems, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Linux seems to be
climbing rapidly in popularity with all the PR it has gotten
recently. How long do you expect that to last?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: We think the
momentum is going to increase even more from now on. If Linux
distributors can unite and application vendors continue to support
Linux, we expect the demand for Linux to continue to increase
rapidly every six months. We believe Linux will become a major
competitor to NT within the next two years.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you see in
the future for your company and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span>: I see a huge future
for Linux and Corel. Linux will be the major alternative to NT and
Corel will be the major productivity and graphics software company
on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p></div></div>
