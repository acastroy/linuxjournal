set permissions in a directory, but it doesn't allow me to set
execute. I use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
umask a=rwx
</pre><p>and when I create a new file the permissions are
<b  >-rw-rw-rw-</b>.
</p><p>Can you give me a quick explanation of this command?
Thanks.  &mdash;Ernesto Jardim, ernesto@ipimar.pt</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>umask</b></span>
doesn't set permissions; it uses a mask to clear existing file
permissions. The umask is also used by the shell to set initial
file permissions on a newly created file. Specifically, permissions
in the umask are turned off from 0666. The default umask is
commonly 022 (in octal notation). In binary it is 000 010 010 which
is equivalent to <b  >----w--w-</b>. When a file is
created, the default permissions are <b  >rw-rw-rw-</b>
(666) and after the <b  >umask</b> is applied, they will
be <b  >rw-r--r--</b> (644). To set permissions, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ee580.0x2ae66b8"></a>IDE/ATAPI Support?</h2></div></div><p>I have two technical questions that I can't seem to solve by
reading HOWTOs.</p><p>1) Has anything been done for the IDE/ATAPI version of the
Iomega Zip drive? Every HOWTO I have read seems to cover only the
SCSI and the parallel port versions.</p><p>2) I have an HP ScanJet 5P scanner, with complementary
Symbios one device SCSI controller. When I boot Linux, it says it
doesn't detect any SCSI hosts. Is this normal and what is the
reason behind it?
&mdash;Henk Verleye, henk@sophis.be</p><p>1) Newer kernels (like 2.0.35) support IDE/ATAPI removables.
Just include IDE/ATAPI FLOPPY support and recompile the
kernel.</p><p>2) Frankly, I don't know if this type of SCSI controller is
supported, but if it is, make sure the ncr53c8xx SCSI driver is
compiled into the kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ee580.0x2ae6920"></a>Switching Hard Drives</h2></div></div><p>I have one hard drive for Linux Red Hat 5.0 and one for
Windows and want to switch them. Linux is on hda1 and Windows is on
hdb1. hdb1 is the faster of the two, and I want to move Linux to it
and put Windows on hda1. I know how to do the Windows part, but how
do I duplicate everything on hda1 to hdb1? hdb1 is a bigger hard
drive and has more than twice the speed of hda1. &mdash;Jon,
LordShroom@hempseed.com</p><p>First boot Linux, then mount hdb1 under /mnt with
<b  >mount&nbsp;/dev/hdb1&nbsp;/mnt</b>; then, if one
partition is all you need to copy, type the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp -a --one-file-system / /mnt
</pre><p>Wait for the copy to finish, then type
<b  >umount&nbsp;/mnt</b>. If you have more than one file
system you want to copy, you have to repeat this for each
partition. Now you need to change /etc/lilo.conf so that LILO boots
from hdb1 instead.

a Zip disk formatted in Windows 98. The file system is not FAT32;
it is FAT16. I can easily mount a Linux EXT2 Zip, but not the
Windows 98 one. I'm not sure if I have the relevant information in
my FSTAB&mdash;maybe someone can tell me what I need. I've used commands
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t msdos
</pre><p>I've tried many variations of this with no success. Is there
something I'm missing? The <b  >man mount</b> help seems
informative, but yields no solutions &mdash;Edward Heshka,
heshka@idirect.com
</p><p>The default partition used on a Zip disk under DOS/Windows is
the fourth partition. Don't ask me why! Add entries similar to
these to your /etc/fstab:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sdc1 /zip ext2 noauto,rw,user,nosuid,sync
/dev/sdc4 /zipdos msdos noauto,rw,user,nosuid,sync,mode=0777
</pre><p>Make sure the mount points exist and you use the
correct SCSI device. Check the messages during bootup if you're not
sure. Now you can mount a DOS Zip disk with
<b  >mount /zipdos</b> and an EXT2 Zip disk
with <b  >mount /zip</b>.

Linux 5.1 on my laptop and have configured X appropriately. I have
made appropriate network settings and I want to use network shares
(i.e., directories) that exist in my company's Windows NT domain.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also, we use MS
Exchange for our e-mail and I have had limited success in
configuring a POP3 client to hit the server. Thanks in
advance. &mdash;William B. Winslow, bill.winslow@atkearney.com</p><p>One word: SAMBA. You can find information on SAMBA
at http://www.samba.bst.tj/samba/samba.html. Also, read the review
in <i  >Linux Journal</i> of John Blair's
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>SAMBA: Integrating UNIX and Windows</em></span> to see
if it is a resource you are interested in using.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ee580.0x2ae71b8"></a>Shutting Down</h2></div></div><p>I am using Red Hat 4.2. I would like to give a user who is
not root the permission to shut down the system. The man page says,
&ldquo;write the name of the user in the file /etc/shutdown.allow&rdquo;.
Unfortunately, this has no effect, i.e., the user gets the message
&ldquo;must be root&rdquo; after typing <b  >shutdown</b>. &mdash;Thomas
Okon, okon@math.tu-dresden.de</p><p>The only way I know of for any user to correctly shut down a
Linux system is to be physically present at the keyboard and press
<b  >ctrl-alt-del</b>. This key sequence has the effect
of running shutdown from init(8). This is the default behavior and
all /etc/shutdown.allow does is to restrict
<b  >ctrl-alt-del</b> even more to specifically named
users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ee580.0x2ae7420"></a>Updating Web Site</h2></div></div><p>I am using Red Hat 5.0. How can I write a script that
compares two directories recursively, one on the localhost, the
other on an FTP site, then upload only the newer files to the FTP
site? I wish to easily update my web site which is getting quite
large and difficult to update
manually. &mdash;Grim_Sweeper@softhome.net</p><p>The good news is the solution is already available. The bad
news is that you will have to configure it to fit your needs. I'm
talking about the mirror package available at
ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/mirror/mirror.tar.gz. This is an
excerpt from the man page:</p></div></div>
<div class="authorblurb"><p>Mirror was written for use by archive maintainers
      but can be used by anyone wanting to transfer a lot of files via
      ftp. Regardless of how it is called, mirror always performs the
      same basic steps. It connects to the remote site, internally builds
      a directory listing of the local target directory, builds one for
      the remote directory, compares them, creates any subdirectories
      required, transfers the appropriate files (setting their
      time-stamps to match those on the remote site), creates any
      symbolic links, removes any unnecessary objects and finally drops
      the connection.</p></div>
