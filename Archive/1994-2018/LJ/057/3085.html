    Mr. Lukka takes a look at VRML basics including scripting,
    animation
    and applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd77348"></a></h2></div></div><p>VRML is intended to be for virtual
reality what HTML is for text&mdash;a structured, standard,
cross-platform format for static or interactive hyperlinked
content. Just like HTML, it can be written by hand or generated by
a program (the latter is usually preferable).
</p><p>About a year ago VRML was catching on quickly, but much of
that enthusiasm seems to have faded. It has not yet taken its place
alongside HTML, JPEG and CGI as one of the basic, widely deployed
web technologies.</p><p>One reason why this might be true is that no workable VRML
browser for Linux or other UNIX-like operating systems is
available. The ones that do exist are incomplete and generally not
able to display web content in VRML well enough for serious use.
For example, the cross-platform offerings are not able to handle
Script nodes, which are one of the most important additions to the
new VRML97.</p><p>My theory as to why this might influence the general
acceptance of VRML is that a large fraction of people who are
interested in cool technologies are using Linux and do not want to
support an application that does not work with Linux and other
properly working operating systems.</p><p>My scientific work needs the interactive visualization that
VRML provides. While many different 3-D packages are available,
VRML has the advantage in that it supports many sorts of
interactions with the scene. Also, I would be able to send the
diagrams I made with it to colleagues by e-mail.</p><p>After finding the available browsers to be unsatisfactory, I
decided to write my own VRML browser. This browser, called FreeWRL,
is rapidly approaching VRML97 specification compliance, and
supports most of the capabilities lacking in other Linux browsers.
I wrote it in Perl, as it was the only language that would enable
me to get it working quickly.</p><p>With the availability of FreeWRL, I think many free OS users
might wish to evaluate or re-evaluate VRML. In this article, I'll
attempt to lay out the basic concepts of VRML and explain how it
might be useful.</p><p>To run the code listed here, you need a VRML browser. If you
don't have one, and are running Linux or some other UNIX-like OS,
go to http://www.iki.edu/lukka/freewrl/ and follow the installation
instructions.</p><p>Notice in particular the words &ldquo;if you have any trouble,
e-mail me.&rdquo; The very worst thing you can do with free software is
to download it, see that it doesn't work for some reason, leave it,
and tell your friends that it doesn't work. The author will never
know what is wrong with his package and will not be able to improve
it, while rumors will be spreading everywhere that the package is
not worth trying. Good bug reports are the least you can do for
free software developers in return for their effort. &ldquo;Thank-you&rdquo;
e-mail is nice, but not nearly as vital.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd77710"></a>The Basics</h2></div></div><p>Instead of a lengthy description, let's start with the code
for drawing a simple world (see <a href="3085l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>). We'll start with the inner section: a sphere is
described with a radius of 0.5. (In VRML, the units are usually
called meters but that is just a convention.) This
<b  >sphere</b> is the <b  >geometry</b> of a
<b  >Shape</b> node, whose &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; has a
<b  >diffuseColor</b> of 0.8 0 0, i.e., very bright red.
Therefore, the Shape actually describes a red sphere. This shape is
one of the <b  >children</b> of a
<b  >Transform</b>, whose <b  >translation</b>
is 0 1 0, i.e., one meter upwards on the Y axis, which, from the
default viewpoint on the positive Z axis, is up. The first line is
a comment telling the browser this file is written in VRML version
2.0.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3085f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1

</p></div></div><p>In short, we have just described a red sphere with a radius
of half a meter and lying one meter above the origin. (See Figure
1.) Now the code in <a href="3085l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> may
seem a somewhat onerous way of describing such a simple scene. For
example, the following might be easier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# THIS IS NOT LEGAL VRML&mdash;SEE TEXT
Sphere {
        center 0 1 0
        radius 0.5
        color 0.8 0 0
}
</pre><p>In fact, you can do this: it is possible to create your own
nodes suitable for your own application using
<span   class="emphasis"><em>prototypes</em></span>, which are similar in spirit to
preprocessor macros in C, as shown in
<a href="3085l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3085f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2

</p></div></div>

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3085f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3

</p></div></div>

</p><p>The scene described by the code in Listing 2 is shown from
two different angles in Figures 2 and 3. Now you can define any
number of scenes like this, using the <b  >PROTO</b> you
just defined. Of course, you do have to deal with including the
original <b  >PROTO</b> in the beginning. It is also
possible to refer to it in another file using so-called
<b  >EXTERNPROTO</b>s, which include the interface part
(in brackets) but omit the definition (in braces). Even this might
sometimes feel like too much typing. In that case, you can easily
write a Perl script to include the correct
<b  >PROTO</b>s in your VRML files, or to do whatever
other repetitive tasks you need done.</p><p>In scene graphs, you can give a node a name using the
<b  >DEF</b> statement and use it again in another place
with a <b  >USE</b> statement&mdash;see
<a href="3085l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p><p>Note that unlike with <b  >PROTO</b>s, where a
complete copy of the contents of the prototype is made, only one
Appearance node is present, which is referred to in two places. For
example, if we later animate the appearance to change the color
from red to blue, both the box and the sphere change color; whereas
if we animate the color of a <b  >Thing</b> in the
<b  >PROTO</b> example, only that one
<b  >Thing</b> changes color. Once a node has been named
with <b  >DEF</b>, it can be used in
<b  >USE</b> statements any number of times.</p><p>Now that you have a sense of what is going on, let's have a
more formal description of what we just did. A VRML
<span   class="emphasis"><em>world</em></span> is described as a hierarchy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span> called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>scene
graph</em></span>. Each node is of a particular <span   class="emphasis"><em>node
type</em></span>, and for each node type the VRML97 specification
defines various fields. Each field has a type and a default value.
The syntax for a node is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NodeType {
        field value
        field value
        ...
}
</pre><p>where the syntax for a value depends on the type of the
field. For example, the value of an <b  >SFVec3f</b> is
three floating-point numbers and the value of an
<b  >SFNode</b> is another node just like above.
</p><p>The single-valued (SF) field types are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >SFBool</b>: a Boolean value, written
<b  >TRUE</b> or <b  >FALSE</b></p></li><li><p><b  >SFFloat</b>: a floating-point
number</p></li><li><p><b  >SFImage</b>: an image, described by
several integer values, first width, height and number of
components, then width*height values for the pixels</p></li><li><p><b  >SFInt32</b>: a 32-bit integer</p></li><li><p><b  >SFNode</b>: a node</p></li><li><p><b  >SFRotation</b>: a rotation: 3
floating-point values for an axis and one for the angle in
radians</p></li><li><p><b  >SFString</b>: a string in double
quotes. Inside, double quotes and backslashes are quoted by a
backslash</p></li><li><p><b  >SFTime</b>: a floating-point value,
time in seconds since a specific origin</p></li><li><p><b  >SFVec2f</b>: a two-dimensional
vector containing two floating-point values</p></li><li><p><b  >SFVec3f</b>: a three-dimensional
vector containing three floating-point values</p></li></ul></div><p>For most SF field types there exists a corresponding MF field
type, which simply means zero-or-more values of the corresponding
SF type. For example, the following would be legal values for a
<b  >MFVec3f</b> field:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[]
0.1 2 3
[0.1 4 2]
[0.5 2 6 1 6 4 7 4 6]
[0.5 2 6, 1 6 4, 7 4 6]
</pre>


That is, the values may or may not be separated by commas and must
be surrounded by brackets if there are more or less than one of
them.
</p><p>These names for the field types are also used inside the
<b  >PROTO</b> declarations: the syntax of a
<b  >PROTO</b> is basically</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PROTO Name [
        field Type fieldName defaultvalue
        exposedField Type fieldName defaultvalue
        eventOut Type fieldName
        eventIn Type fieldName
        ...
] {
        Node { ... }
        ...
}
</pre><p>where inside the <b  >PROTO</b> body, field values
can also be specified using <b  >IS</b> statements, which
equate that field with one of the published fields of the
<b  >PROTO</b> (e.g., the <b  >center</b> field
of the <b  >Thing</b> <b  >PROTO</b> above).
</p><p>For descriptions of all the node types and their fields as
well as the exact grammar and semantics of VRML, see the VRML97
specification (found at http://www.vrml.org/) or a book. Figure 3
shows Netscape displaying the definition for the
<span   class="bold"><b>IndexedFaceSet</b></span> node (which makes
it possible to describe arbitrary polygonal geometry) from the web
site.</p><p>This is basically all you need to know to create static VRML
scenes, except for the nitty-gritty details which you can find in
the above-mentioned source. Once you do create worlds using
FreeWRL, send me a note by e-mail and I'll put a link to your
worlds on the FreeWRL web page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd704c0"></a>Animation and Interaction</h2></div></div><p>Of course, creating static scenes is not such a big deal. The
truly interesting part of VRML is its ability to interact with the
user. Suppose you want to demonstrate the concept of a cross
product of two vectors to a friend. You can draw all sorts of 2-D
diagrams, but what would be a better description than a 3-D graph
in which your friend could adjust two vectors and see the cross
product change in real time (especially since you can embed it into
a web page using the HTML <b  >embed</b> tag)? One of the
FreeWRL demos (Figure 4) does exactly this, plus the vector sum and
difference.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3085f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4

</p></div></div><p>In the previous section, you saw how the Nodes describe the
scene to be rendered. What I didn't mention is that nodes can send
<span   class="emphasis"><em>events</em></span> to each other along specified
<span   class="emphasis"><em>routes</em></span>. The event routes are independent of
the scene hierarchy.</p><p>Routes are specified by ROUTE statements. For example,
<a href="3085l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> creates a white box
(Figure 5), which cycles smoothly through red and blue when
clicked, returning to white 2.5 seconds after the click. What
happens when you click on the box? First, the BUTTON node senses it
(most sensors in VRML sense events from their siblings, in this
case the Shape node defining the box) and sends a touchTime event.
The ROUTE statement causes that event to be routed into the
startTime of the TimeSensor TS, which causes it to start generating
time events for one cycle (the length of the cycle is 2.5 seconds).
At each clock tick, the TimeSensor sends an event called
<b  >fraction_changed</b> with an SFFloat value between 0
and 1 (giving the fraction of the time in the cycle that has gone
by). This event is then routed to CI which is a ColorInterpolator,
i.e., it does piecewise linear interpolations of color values. CI
then sends a value_changed event that MAT receives as diffuseColor,
then the color of the box changes. For example, if CI receives a
set_fraction event with the value 0.3, it checks its key field and
notices that 0.3 is between the first and second value. It is six
tenths of the way to the second value; therefore, the output is the
color (0.6 0.6 0.6).</p><p>Having events go through an interpolator to reach their
destination is a fairly common idiom in VRML, as this allows you to
specify arbitrary mappings relatively easily and cheaply. Several
different kinds of interpolators are in the VRML97 specification,
for different data types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd70a40"></a>Scripting</h2></div></div><p>However, interpolators will take you only so far: for one
thing, they can't toggle on a light at a particular point in the
sequence. It would have been easy for the VRML97 specification
authors to add a node type to accomplish this, but they chose not
to. Instead, they chose to create a very general interface to
external scripting languages, Java and JavaScript. You can define
arbitrary behaviours for your world using these programming
languages.</p><p>If we want to have the Box in the previous example disappear
and be replaced by a small blue sphere for the first 1.5 seconds of
each cycle, we need to use a Script node. This particular example
is shown in <a href="3085l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>. The TS and
CI nodes and the routes between them and MAT are the same as in the
previous example.</p><p>As is obvious from the example, the syntax of specifying
fields inside the Script node is similar to the
<b  >PROTO</b> interface section: instead of just saying
<b  >fieldName value</b> we are saying <b  >kind Type
fieldName</b> followed by <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> for
fields. This is because the specification defines only three fields
for the Script node: <b  >url</b>,
<b  >directOutput</b> and <b  >mustEvaluate</b>
and leaves it up to the programmer to define the
<b  >eventIns</b>, <b  >fields</b> and
<b  >eventOuts</b> of his script.</p><p>The actual script inside the Script node is specified in the
<b  >url</b> field. In this case, it is written in
JavaScript and is embedded into the URL. It would also have been
possible to write the script into a file (with the .js suffix) and
to refer to that file in the URL. Alternatively, the script could
have been written in another scripting language (e.g., Java or
Perl).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd71070"></a>Applications</h2></div></div><p>So far, we've discussed how to write VRML. However, the most
interesting results come from creating VRML automatically. Static
worlds that are programmed once are interesting mostly for games,
art or advertisements. Great possibilities remain to be exploited
in the interface between the rest of the information world and the
3-D browser.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3085f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5

</p></div></div><p>Also, we can use the API provided by the browser to create an
application that uses VRML to provide a part of the GUI. A fairly
simple interface can be written as a Perl program that uses the
FreeWRL browser and GTK together to provide a user interface, which
would be difficult to do in VRML or GTK alone. The main window
consists of an entry into which you can enter a function you want
the program to plot, a button to plot it, and three labels showing
the X,Y coordinates and the function value at the point where your
mouse last touched the function surface. The program also places a
blue box at this point in the 3-D window. It would be trivial to
add code to take 2-D or 3-D snapshots of this scene, as either the
usual image files (GIF/JPEG) or VRML, once you have the scene
displayed in the browser.</p><p>Basically, in addition to creating the GTK GUI, the code
simply creates a browser window, loads a VRML world from a string
and then calls a browser method to obtain a reference to an
<span   class="bold"><b>ElevationGrid</b></span> node in the scene.
It then sends events to this ElevationGrid to set the shape of the
surface via the <span   class="bold"><b>height</b></span> field. The
program also registers a listener for a
<b  >TouchSensor</b> node in the scene, so it is able to
obtain the mouse position on the surface. The really interesting
thing is that all the code for this application is under 200 lines
with comments. (The application is included in the FreeWRL
distribution, so I will not include the full source code
here.)</p><p>It is also possible to access the VRML browser through a Java
API called EAI (external authoring interface). This enables one to
write web applets that access a VRML scene. At the time of this
writing, FreeWRL partially implements the Java EAI API but isn't
yet able to provide this API while running inside Netscape. By the
time you read this article, this situation may have changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc7f580.0xd71540"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Rather than writing a complete tutorial, I've tried to give
an overview of what VRML is and what it might be useful for. I hope
I've provided some new ideas that you can put to use at the right
time. If you need more complete references, links to many sources
can be found at http://www.vrml.org/, the web site of the VRML
Consortium. The FreeWRL home page is at
