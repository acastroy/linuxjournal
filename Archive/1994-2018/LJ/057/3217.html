Antipolis</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.esinsa.unice.fr/xxl.html</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Larry Ayers</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span> is the fruit of a
long-term student project of the &ldquo;Maitrise d'Informatique&rdquo; at the
University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis in France. The intent of xxl is
to produce a graphical spreadsheet which is both uncomplicated and
easy to learn and use. <span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span>, along
with the STk and TkTable packages upon which it depends, are freely
available, open-source software. The license terms are similar to
those accompanying the Tcl/Tk software.
</p><p><a href="3217f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. xxl
Toolbar</b></span></a></p><p>This spreadsheet is not completely self-contained. It needs a
working installation of STk, a variation of the Tk toolkit which
uses the Scheme programming language as a command interpreter
instead of the usual Tcl. The TkTable widget library (which gives
Tk the ability to display data in a tabular format) is included
with the xxl distribution.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span> is not designed to load
or save files in the proprietary formats used by commercial
spreadsheets. Files can be saved in four formats: HTML, plaintext,
LaTeX and CSV (comma-separated values). The CSV format is supported
by many commercial spreadsheets; it is sort of a
least-common-denominator ASCII text data format which uses new
lines to distinguish the rows and commas to separate the
columns.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec1978"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span> does not install
quickly, due to its dependence on the STk package. STk can be
obtained from http://kaolin.unice.fr/STk/ in both source and binary
formats; the source code is preferable, since it will most likely
be the latest version. Luckily, STk is not at all difficult to
build. Before installing xxl, it is a good idea to try out the test
programs in the /Tests subdirectory of the STk source distribution,
just to be sure it is working correctly.</p><p>Once STk is up and running, compiling and installing xxl is
relatively easy. A configure script adapts the Makefile to your
system, and there really isn't much code to be compiled. Most of
xxl (aside from the TkTable library and a few other small shared
libraries) is in the form of STk and STklos scripts, which are
written in Scheme. The <b  >make&nbsp;install</b> copies
the xxl files to /usr/local/lib/xxl. In order to be able to run xxl
from any directory, I created a symbolic link from xxl.stk to
/usr/local/bin/xxl. Make sure you save a copy of the sole
documentation file, xxl.doc.ps, and the files in the /Tests
subdirectory, which are example spreadsheets saved in various
formats. These files are helpful as examples while learning the
application.</p><p>In order to make full use of this spreadsheet, a TeX and
LaTeX installation is also needed. Although xxl can save files in
other formats, the LaTeX format enables high-quality PostScript
versions of files to be created, which are well-suited for
printing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec1be0"></a>Using the Spreadsheet</h2></div></div><p>When xxl starts up, two windows are created. The larger one
is the spreadsheet and the other is an independent control window
containing the icons and menus. Small &ldquo;balloon help&rdquo; messages
appear above each icon when a mouse cursor lingers over it. At
first glance, I thought I would be able to create a simple
spreadsheet without consulting the documentation, but after several
fruitless attempts to enter the formula for the sum of a column, I
finally read the PostScript documentation.</p><p><a href="3217f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. xxl
Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>My assumption that simply clicking on the icon would be
enough to sum cell values was wrong; doing this will enter part of
what is needed into the command-input entry field, but the
remainder has to be entered manually. Clicking the icon will enter
<b  >sum(</b>, but what is needed is (as an example)
<b  >=sum(B2:B8)</b>. This has to be done only once, as
the copy-and-paste key bindings can copy a formula from one cell
and paste it into another; the column location is automatically
changed to accommodate the new location. Columns are automatically
recalculated when entries are added or changed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span> has some useful
mouse-based features. Clicking button two on a cell border allows
the cell to be dynamically resized. Cutting, copying and pasting of
cell values is analogous to the standard x-selection method.</p><p>The font, font size and style of either individual cells or
selected groups of cells can be set from the control bar.
Currently, no support exists for graphing or charting of the
spreadsheet data. A wide variety of mathematical, statistical and
Boolean functions can be applied to selected cells or columns, but
as with the above &ldquo;sum cell values&rdquo; example, only a bare skeleton
of the required formula command is entered into the command entry
field. The remainder needs to be entered by hand, but thereafter
the formula can be easily copied and pasted into other cells. Any
row or column can be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in place, which is typically used
for identification text at the left and top. These fixed rows and
columns will remain visible when a spreadsheet is scrolled.</p><p>Several sample spreadsheets are included with the xxl source.
I found these to be at least as useful as the documentation while
learning to create a spreadsheet with xxl. Load one of these
examples into the main window, then select one of the cells and the
formula which produced it will be shown in the input entry
field.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec2058"></a>Limitations</h2></div></div><p>Since an <b  >undo</b> command isn't currently
implemented, saving often is advisable. The lack of graphing and
charting capabilities limits the usefulness of xxl in a business
environment, but xxl <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> produce nicely
formatted text-only output. The use of Scheme (and STk's
object-oriented Scheme extension, STklos) has its pros and cons. A
user familiar with Scheme would be able to add extensions and
generally adapt xxl to particular needs, but others will see xxl as
yet another application with a new scripting language to learn.
Scheme has a relatively simple and transparent syntax, and even
non-Schemers can adapt existing scripts to their purposes. The case
of the GIMP graphics application and its Scheme-based Script-Fu
scripting facility shows that people can use existing scripts as
templates to produce new functionality without being Scheme
adepts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec2210"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>The xxl web site (http://www.esinsa.unice.fr/xxl.html) has
the latest information on xxl, as well as a link to the FTP
download site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec2318"></a>Comparison with Other Free Spreadsheets</h2></div></div><p>Several other freely available spreadsheets, offering various
mixes of features are under development. I found the Siag (which
stands for Scheme In A Grid) spreadsheet, part of the Siag Office
Suite (http://www.edu.stockholm.se/siag/), to be easier to use than
xxl. Like xxl, Siag is Scheme-based, but has both an X Window
System and a character-mode interface. Siag can save in a variety
of formats, including those supported by xxl, as well as Lotus
1-2-3, a native Siag format, Scheme code and troff. Along with its
native Scheme, Siag has the ability to accept commands in Tcl, C
and Guile (the GNU Scheme-based scripting language). Siag is
distributed along with a basic word processor and an animation
package. These two components are currently not as useful as the
spreadsheet, but the source distribution includes all three. I've
noticed that the Debian Linux distribution has separated these
applications, so that if someone just wants the spreadsheet, it can
be obtained separately.</p><p>Miguel Icaza, one of the principal developers of the GNOME
desktop project, has been working on a spreadsheet called Gnumeric.
It is still in the early stages, but looks as if it may end up
being worthy of investigation. The screenshots available on the
http://www.gnome.org/ web site certainly look promising.</p><p>The Oleo spreadsheet from the GNU project
(ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/oleo/) has been available for quite
awhile, but until recently it was strictly a character-mode
application. I had just about given up on further development, when
new versions began to appear in recent months. The current beta
versions have a Motif X Window System interface (which compiles and
functions well with newer versions of LessTif) and a GTK version is
in the works. Oleo is particularly appealing to users of the Emacs
or XEmacs text editors, as many of the key bindings are identical.
Oleo can make use of Sciplot for graphical output. The current
version (1.6.8) is not completely usable, but is meant as a
proof-of-concept. I was impressed by the progress.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc9580.0x1ec24d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xxl</b></span> is not an application
that lends itself to quick utilization by the typical business
user. The learning curve could be made simpler, although a user
familiar with Scheme will have a definite advantage. More complete
documentation (and perhaps a tutorial) would help. I found the
icons on the toolbar to be misleading in a way. A traditional
spreadsheet normally requires a user to learn the formula syntax
and enter it manually. The xxl icon for summing a column, for
example, will enter part of the formula needed, but not all. It
seems to me that an icon should either do most of what is also
needed in such a case or not be there at all, as the whole point of
such icons is to make core tasks possible without prior study. On
the plus side, xxl <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> free, and the Scheme
scripts which contain most of its internal routines can be
augmented and extended. The calculation functions seemed speedy
enough, and the various save formats functioned well for me.</p><p>Those looking for a graphical spreadsheet with graphing and
charting capabilities might take a look at Xesslite, an inexpensive
subset of the Xess spreadsheet available in a 30-day trial form
from http://www.ais.com/. A related commercial spreadsheet from
another firm is NExS, available in a trial form from
http://www.xess.com/prodinfo.html. Both of these products are able
to read Excel files.</p><p>Other alternatives are the spreadsheets included with the
Applixware and StarOffice business suites.</p></div></div>
