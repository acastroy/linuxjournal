    &ldquo;I don't care if space aliens ate my mouse&rdquo; or a case study
    in both the technical and human issues in porting the Linux
    OS to a new M68K target platform.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c924a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Several barriers to a Linux for Macintosh
68K port exist. The first is that Apple does not want other
operating systems on its machines. While almost all of the workings
of a PC can be learned from books, almost nothing is written about
the Apple Macintosh. Sometimes Macintosh specifications and
technical notes fill in the blanks; at other times, it is necessary
to apply a great deal of guesswork and experimentation to figure
out the hardware.
</p><p>The second barrier is a human one. Most Macintosh machines
were not sold to the technical market, and average Macintosh users
aren't terribly interested in a &ldquo;real operating system&rdquo; for their
computers. Nevertheless, a sizable technically oriented Macintosh
user community does exist, with a lot of Macintosh hardware to go
with it (probably more than any other non-Intel Linux platform). A
further reason has been provided by Apple, whose quaint advice for
owners of 68K machines now appears to be &ldquo;buy a new
computer&rdquo;.</p><p>The third barrier to a Linux port is less obvious and is
hidden by a lack of documentation. Certain folks have speculated
that embarrassment is the main reason for Apple Computer releasing
so little documentation. In general, Macintosh platforms have
positively Stone Age design features. For example, the interrupt
controllers on a Macintosh II are a pair of 6522 VIA chips,
intended for use with the 8-bit 6502 processor. Bad hardware design
makes for poor performance, unless carefully handled. The complete
lack of DMA (direct memory access) is even less helpful. Apple
seems to think no DMA is a feature on most machines and actually
have a technical note stating &ldquo;I used to be a teenage DMA
junkie&rdquo;, which seems to be a justification of their rather comical
hardware design.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c92660"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>To get a port started, the first item needed is hardware. I
had most of this (a 5MB MacII, cast off from the office as too slow
for practical use). Initially, I felt safe helping to work out the
directions for the Linux port, as this system lacked an MMU (memory
management unit) and was therefore unable to run any proposed Linux
port.</p><p>Rob Pelkey started on some very basic Linux work for the
Macintosh, but needed a boot loader to load the Linux OS and kick
it off. On #linux on the LinuxNet IRC network, Jes Sorensen (the
keeper of Linux68K), I and several others got into a few
discussions about the port and what would be required. After a lot
of digging, we managed to gather some basic information on the
Macintosh68K, then filled in further areas by investigating the
excellent detective work the OpenBSD/Macintosh team had done in
getting BSD limping along on Macintosh machines. Further
information came to light from the Linux on OSF Mach port sponsored
by Apple. We discovered that Apple continued to use the same 8-bit
microcontrollers, or emulations of them, and had not redesigned the
systems materially for the new processor.</p><p>Everything seemed perfectly fine. I had a Macintosh box to
laugh at (and we used it occasionally to fail to duplicate problems
Macintosh users had with CymruNet), we could kick ideas around and
I had no MMU in my Macintosh, so I couldn't possibly help write any
code.</p><p>By this point, Rob's effort had stalled badly, as he lacked
the time to write the boot loader needed to run Linux and was
working on passing courses and other sundry items. No worry&mdash;either
someone would eventually take over the project, or he would finish
his courses. Then Frank Neuman sent me an MMU for the MacII and
someone else donated a pair of Ethernet cards&mdash;whoops, no more
excuses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c92870"></a>Learning MacOS</h2></div></div><p>Having fitted the MMU to the Macintosh without blowing it up,
I tried to get MacOS to run with virtual memory. This is supposed
to be simple&mdash;click on the memory tool and select 32-bit, virtual
memory on. But no, my memory control didn't have a 32-bit option,
let alone a virtual memory one. I stared a bit, then checked on a
more modern Mac downstairs to be sure I had the right screen. The
other Macintosh which was running the same MacOS version had the
required option; mine didn't.</p><p>This was my first experience with the horrors of the Mac.
While UNIX says &ldquo;I'm sorry you can't do that&rdquo;, MacOS has exactly
two error messages. It either goes &ldquo;eep?&rdquo; or the setup box is
simply not there until 12 other unidentified items have been
installed and three apparently unrelated dialog boxes have been
completed. Mine was an error of the latter category.</p><p>Apple shipped the MacII with the ability to upgrade to
include an MMU chip; therefore, they sensibly shipped it with a
system ROM incapable of running with the MMU enabled.
Brilliant&mdash;just don't design anything mission-critical, please.
Fortunately, Apple had concealed on their web site a small tool
which patches the ROM entry points so that it can run in 32-bit
mode.</p><p>Okay, so all I had to do was download the tool, install it
and be done&mdash;not so simple. To get the program, I needed the
Ethernet to work. I ended up using
<span   class="bold"><b>kermit</b></span> to transfer 700KB of
Ethernet installer onto the Macintosh. After four hours of fighting
with the completely alien Macintosh archiver tools, I had the
machine talking AppleTalk shares to a Linux box using Netatalk, as
well as insight into why Macintosh people meeting a PC for the
first time look as if they'd just discovered alien life
forms.</p><p>An hour later, I had figured out how to unpack Macbin files
and the Macintosh was in 32-bit mode and admitted the MMU was
present and functional.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c92b30"></a>Building and Booting Linux</h2></div></div><p>The next stage in the operation was to figure out how to boot
a Linux kernel image on the Macintosh. NetBSD and OpenBSD use a
boot loader which loads a.out format executables into the memory of
the Macintosh, shuts the Macintosh down, moves it to address 0 and
jumps to it. I quickly decided I didn't want to write a boot
loader. The OpenBSD loader was almost pure MacOS wizardry at a
level far beyond my abilities. Not to worry&mdash;it soon became
apparent that the OpenBSD loader could be persuaded to load Linux
too. A true loader could wait.</p><p>The next problem was building a Linux kernel image that would
link and (while most likely not doing anything useful) at least
serve as something to feed the OpenBSD booter. Linux is built using
the GNU tool chain, which supports the building of cross compilers.
It is thus possible to compile and build 680x0 binaries on an
ordinary Intel-based PC. It took a couple of builds to get
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> and the GNU binutils
generating almost the right code. Linux a.out executables have a
two-byte header different from the OpenBSD ones, and the OpenBSD
boot loader checked those bytes. Rather than rebuild the entire
tool chain again, I wrote a simple tool to fix the headers.</p><p>Most of Linux/M68K was quite content to build for a Macintosh
target. I filled in everything that complained with dummy
routines&mdash;for Mac keyboards, mice, display, etc. until it all
compiled. Because of the well-designed abstraction layers in the
Linux/M68K kernel, this was quite easy to do. I now had a
completely useless, do-nothing, Macintosh kernel that the OpenBSD
loader would load and which then promptly crashed the machine as I
expected.</p><p>The Linux/M68K project had faced up to the challenges of
supporting multiple types of 680x0-based computers within the same
port, well before I got involved. As a result of the need to
support both the Amiga and Atari systems, clear layers of
abstractions are present. Adding an additional M68K target consists
mostly of filling in platform-specific blank fields. A port to a
completely new processor would have been far more challenging than
this one.</p><p>For the Macintosh case, I filled in various, mostly blank
function handlers. After finally getting the thing to link, I ended
up with a kernel that was hard-coded for a 5MB 68020-based
Macintosh with FPU and a display at 0xF9000000. It had no interrupt
controllers, no disk controllers, no keyboard and no mouse.
Anything else I could find was also hard coded. However, it linked
and that was the important thing. Having done a bit of reading up
on the innards of the console drivers (and much interrogation of
Jes), I wrote a fairly simplistic back end for the generic console
driver on the Macintosh. As it turned out, the very simplistic
approach reflected the Macintosh hardware I had, which was a
completely unaccelerated bitmapped display supporting 640x480 in
4-bit colour.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c92df0"></a>Paint It Black</h2></div></div><p>A Linux 68K kernel starts with a partially shared piece of
initialisation code written in 680x0 assembler and using almost all
the most Gothic and peculiar features of the architecture. This
initialisation code also sets up the memory management and caching,
and touches everything no one normally knows about. The 68020,
68851, 68881 combination of chips used in the Macintosh II is
obsolete and Motorola didn't carry documentation on this device. I
did know two things which, in theory, were enough to debug and
figure out what was going on. First, I knew the base address of the
screen memory; second, I knew the address that the code would begin
executing. The very first routine I put in the startup code painted
the screen a revolting blue colour. After about 15 boots and some
staring at the source code, I had a Macintosh that booted to a blue
screen, waited a short while, then crashed.</p><p>In many ways, this was the single hardest item to get going.
When dealing with a completely unknown system environment with no
idea what is around the code, debugging is extremely tricky. Real
commercial hardware people use logic analysers&mdash;I didn't have that
option. I learned several things in the process; notably, that
Macintosh screen memory is not located where the hardware claims it
is until the MMU is set up. I also made the amazing discovery that
the rounded corners on the Macintosh display are drawn in
software.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, the Macintosh went through an
assortment of debugging stripes and coloured patterns as I inched a
few lines at a time through the initialisation assembler code,
fixing it bit by bit and gradually mapping in the needed hardware.
Eventually, the kernel hit the magic
<span   class="bold"><b>start_kernel</b></span> function in the C
code without crashing on the way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c93000"></a>Consoling Yourself</h2></div></div><p>Hitting start_kernel is the beginning of the easy road; at
least on a PC, text-mode consoles are now present instead of
stripes. So theoretically, hitting start_kernel on a Macintosh
should have meant that getting the kernel to initialise a text
console and begin showing useful debugging information was close.
Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p><p>After several attempts to get the console up, I wrote some
routines to print penguins and Macintosh logos on the screen (this
was easier than text). Each significant point the kernel reached
added a penguin to the display, and a failure point before the
console came up printed a given number of burning Macintosh logos.
While hardly as good as print statements, this was good enough to
rapidly locate several bugs in the processing of options passed by
the boot loader (little things like apparently having 0KB of memory
upset the Linux memory initialisation). The code would get to the
beginning of the console setup and die.</p><p>To get past this point, I had to fill in support for the
4-bit packed pixel displays that were used by the Apple Macintosh
&ldquo;Toby&rdquo; display card. The generic bitmapped console drivers for
the 680x0 port supported a wide variety of pixel formats and
naturally excluded the one I needed.</p><p>Had I known at the time, I could have simply switched the
machine to Mono in the display preferences, but I didn't know that
action physically switched the card into a monochrome mode. Adding
4-bit packed pixel wasn't too difficult. I left the somewhat
scarier 2-bit packed pixel support for later, hoping someone else
would write it. The console code is also very modular on the 680x0,
and these console layers (abscon, fbcon) are now used by most
non-Intel ports. It is reasonable to assume that it will be driving
all the ports by the 2.3 kernel series.</p><p>The machine still crashed mysteriously and all evidence
pointed to a structure getting stamped on. I put guard values on
either side of it and checked that they were not overwritten; I
moved the structure in memory; I tried everything I could think of
in order to stop it from being apparently corrupted. (No joy, no
change.) After a bit of head scratching, I added code to check that
the values were okay at boot and at initialisation of each
subsystem. The value was wrong at the start of the C code; it was
also wrong at the start of the assembler.</p><p>This looked as if the boot loader was corrupting data, yet
this made no sense, since the loader would corrupt the same
location, not pick on a specific variable wherever it might be
located. Eventually, I used the GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>objdump</b></span> tools to look at the
binary I was loading. It turned out the GNU linker was at fault and
in some places was loading a completely bogus address for
relocation.</p><p>A new linker and the magic words &ldquo;Calibrating Bogomips&rdquo;
appeared on the screen, followed by a hang, then much rejoicing. In
many ways, the time lost to the linker bug was not that bad.
Eyeballing the code in search of the mystery bug, I had fixed some
twenty or thirty other serious bugs in a vain attempt to find the
illusionary real bug.</p><p>I wasn't too worried about the Bogomip calibration hanging.
It is hard to calibrate time before the interrupt routines and, in
particular, the timer interrupt routines have been written. I
commented it out and after a short while the rest of the code
booted to the point of saying &ldquo;Panic:unable to mount root file
system&rdquo;. A reasonable situation, as it had exactly no device
support except the screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c933c8"></a>Filling In the Blanks</h2></div></div><p>Getting the machine to the point where everything appears to
boot is by no means a completion of the first steps of a porting
project. This stage is when you finally appreciate the real
problems and the scale of work remaining to be done.</p><p>The most important items to fill in were those that dealt
with the most basic system resources: interrupts, memory and the
I/O buses. The interrupts and several I/O subsystems are handled by
a pair of 6522 VIA chips, 8-bit controllers from the Stone Age.
These chips themselves are documented and their locations are
known, even if some of the connections to their I/O pins are a
mystery. A certain amount of mapping work and other detective
information showed that the VIA chips provided the all-important
system timer ticks, handled the keyboard at an extremely low (and
at the time undeciphered) level and provided interfaces for
external interrupts from the bus controllers.</p><p>Several other pins appear to do things such as turn the
Macintosh off. Even now, we don't know what everything on the VIA
chips does or if all the pins have a real use. It also turned out I
got the easy end. The later Macintosh machines replace the second
VIA with a device known as RBV (RAM-based video), which contains a
bad emulation of a VIA chip and various other components in one
piece of glue logic.</p><p>Basic interrupt handling on a Macintosh is relatively clean.
A great deal of attention has been paid to keeping interrupts that
need a fast response at a higher priority than time-consuming
processes. That works well under MacOS, but Linux tends to take
rather too binary a view of interrupts, especially in the drivers.
Certain interrupts are wired in strange ways, presumably to save
components; the SCSI interrupt, for example, is wired through a VIA
but is effectively upside down compared to the other interrupt
sources. Apple saved an inverter by using as an interrupt signal
the fact that the VIA can handle either direction of state
change.</p><p>I ended up with two layers of interrupt handling, which were
mostly hard coded. Unlike a PC, the Macintosh interrupts are hard
wired. Only the Nubus (plug in) cards change positions, and they
all share one interrupt which sets bits in a VIA register to
indicate the real interrupt source.</p><p>Nubus proved quite entertaining. The documentation is weak
and written from the viewpoint of someone building a card for a
Macintosh. It took about a week before the boot-up code would scan
and report a list of which Nubus slots were occupied and the names
of the devices. Once it worked, the Nubus turned out to be an
extremely well-designed system with features much like PCI. Each
slot is allocated a set of memory resources and can raise an
interrupt. A ROM allows the OS to read each device for
identification and driver information. The ROM also contains other
&ldquo;useful&rdquo; data, including icons for the device. At the moment,
these are not visible under Linux, but the intention is to support
/proc/nubus/[<span   class="emphasis"><em>slot</em></span>]/icon.xpm at some time in
the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c936e0"></a>Mapping Ethernet Cards</h2></div></div><p>The Daynaport card I had been given was very close to several
PC designs. The 8390 Ethernet chip and block of RAM on it made that
quite clear. There are, however, 224 possible locations for the
chip and memory within each Nubus slot space.</p><p>Finding out where the device was hidden required building a
collection of kernels which searched the 24 bits of address space
looking for two things. First, it looked for areas of memory which
could be read and written; second, it looked for areas like those
which had the additional property of giving different results when
read back. The 8390 chip has several control registers; by playing
with these, it is possible to reliably identify the chip. (This
same code is used to probe for NE2000 and WD80x3 cards in Linux for
PC.) On the Macintosh, the RAM was easy to find but the 8390 did
not show up.</p><p>Having played with the RAM behaviour a bit, I discovered that
the memory was mapped to alternate 16 bits in its address space.
That is, if you wanted to read it, you had to read two bytes, skip
two bytes, read two bytes, etc. A bit of further experimentation
revealed that the Ethernet controller registers occurred every
fourth byte, that the RAM occurred every other pair of bytes and
was 16-bits wide and that the Ethernet controller saw the 16-bit
wide memory as 8-bit wide.</p><p>This sort of technique worked for mapping a large number of
devices and address spaces and helped to discover the location of
additional devices in the Apple I/O spaces. We still don't know
enough to drive the Apple sound chip and the &ldquo;Integrated Woz
Machine&rdquo; (floppy disk controller), but we do know where they are
located.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c938f0"></a>Rooting for NFS</h2></div></div><p>When you need to start testing a system by booting into user
space, you need a file system. The NFS root file system is
extremely attractive for this and has been used for most ports. The
NFS (Network File System) makes transaction requests at the level
of files rather than disk blocks. This has the saving grace that
errors in the new port cause transactions to get rejected. If you
are trying to debug a new port and a SCSI controller driver at the
same time, you will instead spend much of your time reformatting
and reinstalling the disk from which you are attempting to boot.
Using NFS limits the possibilities for errors and makes it easier
to add and edit files as you attempt to make the machine
work.</p><p>The initial installs were done with a set of
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> files, known as
&ldquo;watchtower&rdquo;, for the M68K. Watchtower is extremely outdated but
is small and easy to unpack. Since the goal was to get a shell
prompt, the age of the binaries was not a serious worry. Watchtower
also demonstrates another strength of Linux/M68K&mdash;all the ports run
the same binaries. Instead of having to cross compile and debug all
the binaries for the Macintosh, I was unpacking and booting a file
system set up for installation on a Commodore Amiga.</p><p>With a few modifications to the drivers and several small bug
fixes to the kernel code, the applications began to run. As most of
the code we needed to add for a new M68K platform was drivers and
setup code, once things began to work, most applications sprang to
life. It took a couple of tweaks to get floating point to always
behave, but once done, I was able to boot the machine fully
multi-user but without keyboard, mouse or hard disk support.</p><p>It took almost a month before anyone else got the kernel to
boot on their own machine. A lot of debugging removed some rather
bad assumptions that had &ldquo;escaped&rdquo; the code cleanup. Gradually,
other MacLinux 68K machines began to pop into being. This is an
extremely important step for any project, as it allows others to
contribute effectively. Michael Schmitz wrote the SCSI drivers and
much of the keyboard and mouse support. He is now adding IDE.
Numerous others have tested and debugged code on many varieties of
Macintosh and even made it work on some.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b9a580.0x1c93b58"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>While any new port is difficult, the structure of the Linux
M68K kernel tree is very well-designed and delivers on its
intention to allow easy portability between M68K targets. Several
sections of this code are rightfully being used cross-architecture
as well as cross-platform.</p><p>Making a free software port work seems to be about having a
small number of people willing to take the project the first half
of the way. Once this point is reached, the project gathers
momentum of its own accord, even when it is something as pointless
as Linux on a Macintosh II.</p><p>Lack of documentation is only a hindrance. It will not
prevent determined people from exercising their basic rights to use
and operate property they bought and now own. Instead, it reflects
badly on the vendor who is trying to be a nuisance. If the only
documentation on the keyboard interface is entitled &ldquo;Space aliens
ate my mouse&rdquo;, someone will still find it.</p><p>Always be the second operating system ported to an
undocumented platform. The sterling work done by the
OpenBSD/Macintosh team was a huge help to the Linux project. I'm
also happy to say that even though half of the world may spend
their time arguing on Usenet advocacy groups, the relationship
between the Linux and BSD Macintosh teams has always been one of
mutual co-operation. Together, we advance our detective work and
knowledge of the Macintosh platforms to the good of all Macintosh
users dumped and orphaned by Apple.</p><p><a href="2996s1.html" target="_self">Thanks</a></p></div></div>
