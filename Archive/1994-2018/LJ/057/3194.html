up a Sun SPARCstation&rdquo;, October 1997) on getting a SPARC up and
running on Red Hat 4.2. Shortly after reading it, I came across an
old SPARC IPX at the local computer graveyard that essentially
needed a CMOS battery to function properly. I snapped it up and
never got around to installing Linux on it until recently. Since
I've moved, I couldn't find the original article and was overjoyed
when I found it in its entirety on your web site. That information
along with the Red Hat Powertools 5.1 disc allowed me to get the
IPX up and running in under an hour.</p><p>Thanks again for all the great information with no
  fluff! &mdash;Leon Hauck leon@progcpu.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1240"></a>Future of Linux Followup</h2></div></div><p>I just received the October issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and was alarmed to discover that I had omitted
from my &ldquo;Future of Linux&rdquo; report the most important &ldquo;Resource&rdquo;
link of all: that of the on-line version of the article itself,
which I continue to update almost weekly:</p><p>http://pobox.com/~newt/reports/linux-19980714-top.html</p><p>Recent developments include Linux product announcements from
Caldera (Netware), Citrix and Sybase; a <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Francisco
Chronicle</em></span> report that the last of the large databases
without a Linux port, IBM's DB2, will be announced for Linux by the
end of September; and news about Dell's Linux pre-installations, a
number of Open Source announcements and a new Linux quarterly in
French: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Magazine France</em></span>.</p><p>More important, perhaps, is the fact that the dozens of links
embedded in the text (e.g., for the Top 500 supercomputer list or
the AP1000+ multi-computer) are available. &mdash;Greg
Roelof snewt@pobox.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1558"></a>Re: July 1998 Issue</h2></div></div><p>It's ironic that when I was reading Griffin Caprio's letter
in the October issue, I had the July issue in my briefcase to take
to work in order to photocopy two articles for some coworkers.
Please do not let the prospect of big circulation lead you to water
down the content of <i  >LJ</i>. I have seen other
computer magazines go that way, and abandoned them.
<i  >LJ</i> is now the only one to which I still
subscribe. &mdash;Tom Kuiper kuiper@jpl.nasa.gov</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1710"></a>Office Suite Review</h2></div></div><p>In the article &ldquo;Applixware vs. StarOffice&rdquo; that appeared in
the October <i  >LJ</i>, Mr. Butzen states that his
criteria for testing included portability, specifically the &ldquo;...
ability to import and export files to Microsoft Office.&rdquo; While he
touched on this issue briefly with his experience exporting to Word
6.0, he neglected a major issue in this regard.</p><p>To my knowledge, neither suite's presentation package will
export to Microsoft PowerPoint format. While this may seem like a
minor point to some, it is a huge issue for those of us who use
presentation software as a routine part of our jobs. Most of us are
not fortunate enough to have access to PC/projection systems
running Linux and the appropriate presentation software, let alone
fortunate enough to find someone willing or able to create 35mm
slides from either of these formats. While exporting presentations
to Windows Meta Files is supported, this is a poor substitute
compared to having the project saved in a format that is easily
edited and displayed, particularly when one is far from his
friendly Linux box.</p><p>I have been a StarOffice 4 user for about six months. While I
find it a bit slow, the major factor preventing me from completely
abandoning Microsoft Windows95 and Microsoft Office is StarOffice's
inability to export presentation files to a more &ldquo;universal&rdquo;
format. I'm surprised that with Linux's popularity in the
scientific community and the common use of presentation software in
those endeavors, this subject has not received more
attention. &mdash;Frank Lynch, MD flynch@statecollege.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1920"></a>October STP Column</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed the October &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo; column, but felt
it was rather dated by the time it hit my mailbox, given the recent
actions by Oracle, Sybase and IBM(DB2). Have you considered running
the column on the <i  >LJ</i> web site instead, so as
to keep the column from becoming too out of sync with current Linux
events?</p><p>I've been working in the database industry for the past 2 1/2
years now, so I naturally feel that the database market will be
critical to Linux's future success. As such, I've kept a close eye
on the Informix, Oracle, Sybase and IBM announcements of late.
Although the Informix-centric information was most excellent,
another article covering the recent adoption of the Linux platform
by all the major database names would be most
welcome. (I'd be interested in finding out whether my own
suspicions about the meaning of these trends are shared by
others.)</p><p>Regardless, I'm planning on photocopying the &ldquo;Stop the
Presses&rdquo; article and posting it outside my door as the latest
salvo in my long-running Linux-PR campaign I've been waging within
my company.</p><p>Many thanks, and keep up the good work! &mdash;Peter
Kuklaf ruviad@coil.com</p><p>We do sometimes put the &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo; column
on the web as soon as it is written, usually in our on-line
e-zine <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>. However, that did not happen for
this particular column &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1c38"></a>Redirecting to Console 9</h2></div></div><p>In my previous letter you published in the &ldquo;Letters to the
Editor&rdquo; column, I referred offhand to &ldquo;redirecting output to
Console 9, as described in a previous issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;. I have received quite a few inquiries as to
which issue that was in and how to do it.</p><p>The issue was #31, the column was &ldquo;Novice to Novice:
Keyboards, Consoles and VT Cruising&rdquo; by John M. Fisk and the page
was 17, the section heading &ldquo;Putting that Unused VT to Work&rdquo;.
However, you don't have to look up that issue, as it is quite
simple. Just add the following line to /etc/syslog.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.*        /dev/tty9
</pre><p>and all your syslog messages are sent to console 9 as well.
</p><p>Thanks, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, for publishing
that tip back in November 1996. It has made a lot of system
administration tasks easier. &mdash;Cynthia
Higginbotham cyhiggin@pipeline.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a1f50"></a>Intel and Red Hat</h2></div></div><p>I have been using Linux since 1992 and have built up a
successful business providing offices with an effective cheap
alternative to expensive Microsoft servers and products. Up until
the beginning of this year, it did not matter which distribution
you used; everything worked just fine. Okay, each distribution
worked slightly different, but they all used the same libraries and
kernel. When I read in the computing press that the big software
houses were starting to support Linux, I knew that before long,
Linux would rival MS on the same level for both back end and
desktop.</p><p>However, within a few weeks of Intel buying a stake in Red
Hat, I read that some products will work only with the Red Hat
version of Linux. We must stop this now, or in two years we will
have a situation of Intel-Hat becoming the next Microsoft with an
85% stake in the Linux market. Last week I installed a mail, Samba
and web proxy server into an office in London. I was asked, &ldquo;Is
this Red Hat you are installing?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No, it is
Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>I believe we must push for a common standard. Any product
released for Linux must work on
all distributions. Please don't let Intel-Hat
muscle their way in or we will be in the same position in two to
three years as we are with Microsoft now. &mdash;Robert
Weeks robert.weeks@csfp.co.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a9580.0x27a2108"></a>Review of Applixware vs. StarOffice</h2></div></div><p>I read <i  >LJ</i> here in Germany and have often
read good reviews in your magazine. Anyway, this special review
&ldquo;Applix vs. StarOffice&rdquo; by Fred Butzen in the October issue is
somewhat incorrect.</p><p>StarDivision released StarOffice 4.0 some time ago, and three
service packs have already reached the users. Since 4.0, they are
no longer using Motif but their own StarView GUI which has a
Windows look and feel. Speed, features and reliability have all
been improved greatly since the 3.0 version. By now, the Linux
StarOffice 4.5 preview release is out and can be tested. This
preview got released even before the other 4.5 preview releases had
been shipped. You can even buy an official version of StarOffice
4.5 including the handbook and a sheet with notes about the
differences between the Windows and Linux versions. They are
actually selling the 4.0sp3 version now, with the guarantee of
sending you the new 4.5 CD-ROM as soon as it is no longer a
preview/beta version. &mdash;Holger
