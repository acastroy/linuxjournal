    A description of the history and status of Linux in

American University (http://www.lau.edu.lb/) Byblos Campus
(LAU-Byblos) in November 1994 by Professors Walid Keirouz
(walid@lau.edu.lb) and Haidar Harmanani (haidar@lau.edu.lb). Before
introducing Linux, the computer lab relied almost exclusively on
Microsoft, Borland and Novell products. No one at LAU, and very few
elsewhere in Lebanon, had heard of Linux. The first installations
were done at LAU-Byblos using floppies on i486/33 machines with 8MB
of RAM with kernel 0.99. Later on, these machines were upgraded to
include CD drives so that we could do CD-based installations. These
Linux PCs were configured into one of the first IP networks at the
university (NFS, YP/NIS).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x27006b8"></a>Students' Response to Linux</h2></div></div><p>After the installations were complete, students were given
access. Since the shell environment seemed a bit strange to those
who had used a graphical environment, they were constantly
complaining. Shortly thereafter, more Pentium machines were ordered
to use as Linux machines. By the time the new machines arrived,
students had become familiar with Linux and were ready for an
introduction to the X Window System. X turned out to be more fun
for the students, because of the network utilities and all the
shareware programs that come with it. These conditions inspired the
students to install Linux on their home machines, turning them into
32-bit multitasking workstations capable of running almost all the
software necessary for their courses.</p><p>With Linux, students can have a workstation at home that is
almost identical to the workstations in the computer lab and can
run the same programs and tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x2700818"></a>Linux at LAU-Byblos</h2></div></div><p>Linux is now being used by the Computer Science/Engineering
faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students. The
professors' Linux machines are hooked to the university network and
course materials are posted on the local web site for students to
download. Apache is used as the web server.</p><p>Needless to say, having Linux at home is a big plus for
students who are not able to stay late at the university, in
particular for those living off campus due to limited on-campus
accommodation. Also, most graduate students have at least a
part-time job and are not able to spend much time at the university
outside of class. The best solution for them was to install Linux
on their home machines; thus, all Computer Science graduate
students have Linux installed at home.</p><p>In the graduate school, Linux is used mainly in the following
graduate courses:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Computer Graphics (OpenGL, SRGP)</p></li><li><p>Distributed Operating Systems</p></li><li><p>Artificial Intelligence (LISP, CLISP)</p></li><li><p>Advanced Computer Networks</p></li><li><p>VLSI Design Automation (Alliance Tools, Magic,
IRSIM, SPICE)</p></li><li><p>Graphical User Interface Design (Moo-tiff,
Xlib)</p></li><li><p>Logic Programming</p></li><li><p>High Performance Computer Architecture</p></li></ul></div><p>The most widely used applications under Linux include:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Emacs and XEmacs editors by most, but also vi,
mainly by beginners</p></li><li><p>Programming/Compilers/Tools: GNU C, GNU C++,
Pascal, GNU Common LISP, PERL, Lex, Flex, Yacc &amp; Bison, gdb and
xgdb</p></li><li><p>Moo-Tiff and Xlib programming for X
interfaces</p></li><li><p>Alliance Tools, Magic, IRSIM and SPICE</p></li><li><p>TeX and LaTeX for document formatting</p></li><li><p>Internet: Pine, ELM, Apache server, Arena, Lynx and
Netscape web browsers</p></li><li><p>Java Development Kit</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x2701528"></a>PCs Running Linux</h2></div></div><p>At LAU-Byblos there are two computer labs. The Computer
Engineering Center includes a Linux server with NFS/NIS with six
Linux clients. The machines consist of P90 with 16/32 MB of RAM,
1.0 GB and 4.0 GB SCSI Drives, SCSI controllers, CD-ROMs and tape
backup in addition to a PostScript HP laser printer. The Computer
Science Center includes four Linux boxes, seven Sun SPARC/Solaris
machines and one SGI workstation. The Linux machines are 166MHz
Pentiums with 32MB of RAM and 1.5/2.5GB hard drives. One of them is
running Red Hat 5.0 and the other three run Slackware with kernel
2.0.30.</p><p>Most of the time, especially near project due dates, an
available Linux machine cannot be found in the computer centers.
For this reason, the department is currently in the process of
purchasing five new Pentium machines to put in service in the
Computer Science center. These machines will also be used for the
network and operating system lab courses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x2701688"></a>Research at the Lebanese American University
(Byblos Campus)</h2></div></div><p>The Computer Science Department is involved in Electronic
Design Automation and Computer Networking and Electronic Publishing
research. More information can be found at
http://vlsi.byblos.lau.edu.lb/.</p><p>Dany Said (dany@flame.byblos.lau.edu.lb), a graduate student
in C.S., is working with Professor Walid Keirouz on
high-performance computing for wave propagation. For this purpose,
they have put together a Beowulf cluster of eight P-II/300 machines
running a customized version of Red Hat 5.0. Tools used in this
project include PVM, MPI and ZPL (a data parallel language
developed at the University of Washington, Seattle,
http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/zpl/). More information on
this work can be found at http://flame.byblos.lau.edu.lb/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x27017e8"></a>Universities Using Linux</h2></div></div><p>At this time, four universities in Lebanon are using
Linux.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>LAU uses Linux in its computer labs; in addition, a
Linux box has acted as the central UUCP mail server for nearly two
years. Distributions and manuals are available for students to use
and a great increase in Linux-related books has been noticed in the
library.</p></li><li><p>American University of Beirut
(http://www.aub.edu.lb) uses Linux in some of its labs, and many
students use it. AUB hosts a Linux mailing list. To subscribe, send
a mail to majordomo@aub.edu.lb and in the body of the message
write: <b  >subscribe linux-users</b>. The address of the
list is linux-users@aub.edu.lb.</p></li><li><p>ESIB (Ecole Superieure D'Ingenieurie &lt;\#224&gt;
Beirut, http://www.esib.edu.lb/) and the Lebanese University use
Linux and many students have Linux installed on their personal
machines.</p></li></ul></div><p>At LAU-Byblos, almost all Computer Science and Engineering
undergraduates have Linux installed on their personal machines. In
addition, 100% of Computer Science Master's degree students have
Linux running on their machines. Overall, we notice that the
percentage of students using Linux is very high. This gives us an
optimistic view for the future of Linux in Lebanon, as current
students will be in key managerial/industrial/computing positions
in the near future, where they will be able to promote Linux as a
cheap and reliable alternative to commercial operating systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x2701c08"></a>Companies Using Linux</h2></div></div><p>At present, very few companies in Lebanon are using Linux
except for a small number of firms needing a cheap, effective
setup. For these companies, Linux is the only choice due to its low
cost and suitability as a web/mail server. One of the popular
Internet Service Providers here uses Linux for its proxy server,
and many web design and publishing companies are using Linux for
simulation purposes and for checking their designed web
pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x26f85a0"></a>Distributions Used</h2></div></div><p>The most widely used distributions are Slackware 96, 3.0, 3.4
and Red Hat 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 from both Red Hat and CheapBytes
(http://www.cheapbytes.com/) and the Debian distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2608580.0x26f86a8"></a>Closing</h2></div></div><p>A major obstacle to widespread use of Linux here is the
availability of pirated software in Lebanon. For example, one can
get an NT 4 Server CD for $5 US or MS Office 97 for $8 US. As a
result, many organizations do not feel the burden of software
purchases and view software as having no value.</p><p>The Lebanese market is almost a raw market when it comes to
Linux/UNIX. We are doing our best to push Linux into the
marketplace. We believe that Linux, in some areas, has reached the
required level to compete with other operating systems, in
particular as a web/mail/ftp server.</p></div></div>
