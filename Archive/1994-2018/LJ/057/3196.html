DupliDisk-Direct, a real-time backup device. Due to its small size

1 device capable of mirroring up to two pairs of IDE, EIDE or U/DMA
drives of any capacity. If a hardware failure disables one of the
mirrored drives, the DupliDisk automatically shifts operations to
the functioning drive. Users have the choice of either a
bay-mounted or rear-mounted external panel for the visual display.
