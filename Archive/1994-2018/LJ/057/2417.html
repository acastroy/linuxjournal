    This article discusses the main characteristics of Distributed
    Inter-Process Communication (DIPC), a relatively simple system software
    that
    provides users of the Linux operating system with both the distributed
    shared
    memory and the message passing paradigms of distributed programming.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9d978"></a></h2></div></div><p>Before Linux, powerful UNIX operating
systems were considered a luxury. Linux made it possible for
ordinary people to have access to an affordable and reliable
computing platform. The only problem is that Linux was originally
based on decades-old designs (see Resources 7), making it less
attractive for more technically minded users. Linux's answer to
this problem is either port and adaptation or introduction of newer
concepts.
</p><p>Building <span   class="emphasis"><em>multi-computers</em></span> (see Resources
1) and programming them are among the more popular research
subjects and demand for them is rapidly rising. Any solution to
distributed programming under Linux should keep up with one of
Linux's more important features: <span   class="emphasis"><em>availability</em></span>
to ordinary users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9db88"></a>Motivation</h2></div></div><p>Linux already had symmetric multi-processing capabilities.
However, it did not provide enough standard facilities for
distributed software development. Programmers and users had to
resort to different add-on packages and various programming models
to write or use distributed software. The mechanisms provided by
these packages usually differed greatly from one another, each
requiring users to learn some new material which was not of any use
to them when migrating to other methods. Many also required
detailed involvement of the programmer in the process of
transferring data over the network; an example is the PVM (Parallel
Virtual Machine) software (see Resources 8). The need for a simpler
distributed programming model, usable by more programmers, was
obvious.</p><p><a href="2417s4.html" target="_self">What is Distributed
Programming?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9dd40"></a>The DIPC Software</h2></div></div><p>DIPC (Distributed Inter-Process Communication) is a
software-only solution for enabling people to build and program
multiple computers easily. Each node can be an ordinary personal
computer. These nodes must be connected to each other by a TCP/IP
(see Resources 3) network. It does not use network broadcasting,
which helps it work in networks without such capabilities. Also, no
assumption of a synchronized clock is made. These features mean
that DIPC could be used in a wide area network (WAN).</p><p>Right from the start, it was decided that <span   class="emphasis"><em>ease of
application programming</em></span> and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>simplicity of
the DIPC itself</em></span> should be among the most important
factors in the system design, even if it were to mean some loss in
performance. This decision was backed by the observation that
computing and telecommunications equipment speeds are improving
rapidly, while training and programming times for distributed
applications are not.</p><p>In DIPC, UNIX System V IPC mechanisms (see Resources 4),
consisting of semaphores, messages and shared memories, are
modified to function in a network environment. This means that
installing DIPC requires changing and recompiling the kernel. Here,
the same system calls used to provide communication between
processes running on the same computer can be used to allow the
communication of processes running on different machines. There is
no new system call for the application programmer's use. There is
also no library to be linked to the application code, and no need
for any modifications in compilers. DIPC could be used with any
language that allows access to the operating system's system calls.
It is completely <span   class="emphasis"><em>camouflaged</em></span> in the
kernel.</p><p>The result is that DIPC supports both the message passing and
the distributed shared memory paradigms of distributed programming,
providing more options for the application programmer (see
Resources 5). It also allows the processes to share only selected
parts of their address space in order to reduce the problems of
false sharing.</p><p>It was decided to implement DIPC in the user space as much as
possible, with minimal changes to the kernel. This leads to a
cleaner and simpler design, but in a monolithic operating system
such as Linux it has the drawback of requiring frequent copy
operations between kernel and user address spaces (see Resources
2). As UNIX does not allow user space processes to access and
change kernel data structures at will, DIPC must have two parts.
The more important part is a program named
<span   class="bold"><b>dipcd</b></span>, which runs with superuser
privileges; dipcd forks several processes to do its work. The other
part is inside the kernel giving dipcd work and letting it see and
manipulate kernel data. The two parts use a private system call to
exchange data. This system call must not be used by other processes
in the system.</p><p>DIPC provides easy data transfer over the network and assumes
that the code to use these data already resides at the suitable
places. This is justifiable when one considers that in most cases,
the program's code changes much less frequently than the
data.</p><p><a href="2417s1.html" target="_self">About the Example Distributed
Program</a></p><p><a href="2417l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Example Distributed
Program</a></p><p>DIPC is only concerned with providing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mechanisms</em></span> for distributed programming. The
policies, e.g., how a program is parallelized, or where an
application program's processes should run, are determined by the
programmer or the end user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9e370"></a>DIPC Clusters</h2></div></div><p>DIPC enables the creation of <span   class="emphasis"><em>clusters</em></span> of
PCs. Computers in the same cluster could work together to solve a
problem. DIPC's clusters are logical entities, meaning they are
independent of any physical network characteristics. Computers
could be added or deleted from a cluster without the need to change
any of the network parameters. Several clusters may exist in the
same physical network, but each computer can belong to at most one
of them. Computers on the same cluster can even be connected to
each other by a WAN. As far as DIPC is concerned, computers in one
cluster never interact with computers in other clusters.</p><p>In normal System V IPC, processes specify numerical
<span   class="emphasis"><em>keys</em></span> to gain access to the same IPC structure
(see Resources 4). They can then use these structures to
communicate with each other. A key normally has a unique meaning in
only one computer. DIPC makes the IPC keys globally known. Here, if
the application programmer wishes, a key can have the same meaning
in more than one machine. Processes on different computers can
communicate with each other the same way they did in a single
machine.</p><p>Information about all the IPC keys in use is kept by one of
dipcd's processes called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>referee</em></span>. Each
cluster has only one referee. In fact, it is having the same
referee that places computers in the same cluster. All other
processes in the cluster refer to this one to find out if a key is
in use. The referee is DIPC's name server. Besides many other
duties, the referee also makes sure that only one computer at a
time will attempt to create an IPC structure with a given key
value, hence the name. Using a central entity simplifies the design
and implementation but can become a bottleneck in large
configurations. Finding a remedy to this problem is left to the
time when DIPC is actually running in such configurations.</p><p>Users may need to run some programs (e.g., utilities) in all
the computers in the system at the same time, and these programs
may need to use the same IPC keys. This could create interference.
To prevent any unwanted interactions, distributed IPC structures
are declared by programmers. The programmer must specify a flag to
do this. The structures are local by default. The mentioned flag is
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> thing the programmer should do to
create a distributed program. The rest is like ordinary System V
IPC programming. Other than this flag to keep DIPC compatible with
older programs, the system is totally transparent to
programmers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9e6e0"></a>DIPC Programs</h2></div></div><p>DIPC's programming model is simple and quite similar to using
ordinary System V IPC. First, a process creates and initializes the
needed IPC structures. After that, other processes are started to
collaborate on the job. All of them can access the same IPC
structures and exchange data. These processes are usually executing
in remote machines, but they could also be running on the same
computer, meaning distributed programs can be written on a single
machine and later run on real multi-computers.</p><p>An important point about DIPC is that no other UNIX facility
is changed to work in a distributed environment. Thus, programmers
cannot use system calls, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span>, which create a process in
the local computer.</p><p>The fact that DIPC programs use numerical keys to transfer
data means they do not need to know where the corresponding IPC
structures are located. DIPC makes sure that processes find the
needed resources just by using the specified keys. The resources
could be located in different computers during different runs of a
distributed program. This logical addressing of resources makes the
programs independent of any physical network
characteristics.</p><p>Simple techniques allow the mapping from logical computing
resources needed by a program to physical resources to be done with
no need to remake the program. As DIPC programs do not need to use
any physical network addresses, they do not need recompiling to run
in new environments. Of course, this does not prevent the
programmer from choosing to make his program dependent on some
physical system characteristics. For example, he could hard code a
computer address in his code. DIPC programmers are discouraged from
doing this type of coding.</p><p>When dipcd is not running, the kernel parts of DIPC are short
circuited, causing the system to behave like a normal Linux
operating system. As a result, users can easily disable the
distributed system. Also, normal Linux kernels are not affected by
DIPC programs, meaning there is no need to change and recompile
these programs when they are to be executed in single computers
with no DIPC support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9e9a0"></a>DIPC's Distributed Shared Memory</h2></div></div><p>Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) (see Resources 6) in DIPC
uses a multiple-readers/single-writer protocol. DIPC replicates the
contents of the shared memory in each computer with reader
processes so they can work in parallel, but there can be only one
computer with processes that write to a shared memory. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>strict consistency</em></span> model is used here, meaning
that a read will return the most recently written value. It also
means there is no need for the programmer to do any special
synchronization activity when accessing a distributed shared memory
segment. The major disadvantage with this scheme is a possible loss
of performance in comparison to other DSM consistency
models.</p><p>DIPC can be configured to provide a segment-based or
page-based DSM. In the first case, DIPC transfers the entire
contents of the shared memory from computer to computer, with no
regard as to whether all data will be used. This could reduce the
data transfer administration time. In the page-based mode, 4KB
pages are transferred as needed, making possible multiple parallel
writes to different pages.</p><p>In DIPC, each computer is allowed to access the shared memory
for at least a configurable time quantum. This lessens the chance
of the shared memory being transferred frequently over the network,
which could result in bad performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9ebb0"></a>Error Detection in DIPC</h2></div></div><p>DIPC assumes a fail-stop (see Resources 9) distributed
environment, so it employs time-outs to find out about any problem.
The at-most-once semantics (see Resources 1) is used here, meaning
DIPC tries everything just once. In case of error, it simply
informs the relevant processes, either by a system call return
value or, for shared memory read/writes, by a signal. DIPC itself
does not do anything to overcome the problem. The user processes
should decide how to deal with the error. This is normal behavior
in many other cases in UNIX .</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9ecb8"></a>Security in DIPC</h2></div></div><p>It is important to provide some means to make sure that the
data are accessed only by people with proper permissions. DIPC uses
login names, not user IDs, to identify users. Remote operations are
performed after assuming the identity of the person who executed
the system call originally. For this to work, one login name on all
computers in a DIPC cluster should denote the same person.</p><p>In order to prevent intrusion to DIPC clusters, addresses of
the computers allowed to take part in a cluster should be put in a
file for DIPC to consult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1e97068"></a>Current Status of DIPC</h2></div></div><p>DIPC is under development mainly in the Iran University of
Science and Technology's (IUST) Department of Computer Engineering,
but people from different parts of the world are currently working
on it. A port to Linux for Motorola 680x0 processors has been
completed. This made DIPC a heterogeneous system, as the two
versions can communicate with each other. DIPC's sources and
related documents can be found on the Internet via anonymous FTP at
sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/system/network/distrib/, or can be
downloaded from DIPC's web page at
http://wallybox.cei.net/dipc/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1e97170"></a>Call for Cooperation</h2></div></div><p>DIPC belongs to the Linux users community, and the ultimate
goal is to make it an integral part of the Linux operating system.
Considering the inadequacy of computing and informational
facilities in IUST, the only way to make sure this software will
survive is for interested people to join in its development.</p><p>To subscribe to DIPC's mailing list, send e-mail to
majordomo@wallybox.cei.net with the body containing &ldquo;subscribe
linux-dipc&rdquo;. Postings should go to

new functionality to an IPC system designed decades ago. Many of
the DIPC's nicer features are the result of its being hidden inside
the kernel. Considering its main characteristics, DIPC has the
potential to introduce ordinary programmers to distributed
programming, thus making Linux one of the first operating systems
with <span   class="emphasis"><em>usable</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>really
used</em></span> distributed programming facilities.</p><p>Several experimental distributed systems are available for
use. Many of them have been implemented in universities running
UNIX variants on workstations produced by different manufacturers.
The fact that, in most cases, researchers did not have free access
to the underlying operating system's source code has had a big
influence on the design decisions. The availability of source code
in Linux has provided new ways to deal with the problems of
distributed programming. DIPC is an example of what can be done
when one has access to the operating system sources. Some could
mention the problems in porting DIPC to proprietary operating
systems with no publicly available source code as a drawback.
However, in our opinion, proprietary operating system vendors and
their users are the ones at a loss here, as they cannot take
advantage of more easy-to-use distributed systems developed by
third parties. This statement does not mean DIPC could not be
implemented in other UNIX variants supporting System V IPC, but
implies that the port can only be attempted by people with access
to kernel source code.</p><p><a href="2417s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2417s3.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
