column in <i  >LJ</i>. This column will take a brief
look at new/updated free software of interest. Each month, hundreds
of open-source software packages are made available by developers
on the Web. Some are included in nearly every distribution, but
many are not. Some languish because not enough people are
interested in or even aware of the software. I would like to
recognize some of these new offerings.
</p><p>The ground rules I will apply are simple. Large, well-known
packages (Apache, Perl, or any modules for either, GIMP, and the
Linux kernel itself come to mind), libraries, commercial software
(Sybase, StarOffice, etc.), or common utilities (binutils, etc.)
will not be included. I will also not highlight
window-manager-centric items (such as all the new software popping
up for KDE), as I expect these will be listed on a centralized
site. Listings will have the package name, URL to home page or
download location, required libraries and a few thoughts of my
own.</p><p>I will use several sources in my search for new and exciting
programs including e-mail from readers and developers. Let me know
what you'd like to read about.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0558"></a>gpasman:http://www.student.wau.nl/~olivier/gpasman/</h2></div></div><p>My hat's off to this one. I have more passwords than I have
old shoes, and I can't keep track of either. Now I can store
passwords in encrypted form on one computer. This is a &ldquo;must
have&rdquo; for system administrators with too many passwords to
remember. Required libraries are libgtk.so.1, libgdk.so.1,
libglib.so.1 (these three comprise gtk-1.0.6), libXext.so.6,
libX11.so.6, libm.so.6, libc.so.6 (glibc).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0660"></a>gtkfind:http://www.oz.net/~mattg/download.html</h2></div></div><p>This program is a great GUI interface to the
<b  >find</b> command. All <b  >find</b>
options (or test expressions) are available, and the program even
accepts standard wild cards. The interface will be particularly
familiar to those of the Windows persuasion, with tabs for all the
major options, pick boxes, text boxes and wheels to select option
arguments. Even help is only a pushbutton away. Output can be sent
to another script for further processing. A very friendly, easy to
use, yet powerful utility. My only gripe would be I could find no
way to write out or display a command line <b  >find</b>
equivalent&mdash;which would be great for those who want to get away
from GUI dependency. <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> would be next on my GUI wish
list. Required libraries are libgtk.so.1, libgdk.so.1,
libglib.so.1, libXext.so.6, libX11.so.6, libm.so.6,
libc.so.6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0920"></a>geg, GTK+ Equation
Grapher:http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/2030/</h2></div></div><p>If you have kids who are beginning to learn algebra, geometry
or trigonometry, here is a simple, fun way to see the equations
they are learning. I think I wasted an hour just checking out all
the trig functions, and I don't have any kids in high school or
college yet. One drawback is that all equations must be expressed
in one variable only, so I haven't yet figured out how to graph a
circle. It is well worth the download. Required libraries are
libgtk.so.1, libgdk.so.1, libglib.so.1, libXext.so.6, libX11.so.6,
libm.so.6, libc.so.6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0a28"></a>xwhois:http://www.goatnet.ml.org/software.html</h2></div></div><p>If you spend as much time as I do trying to find all the spam
kings that waste our time and bandwidth with junk e-mail, you'll
love this little utility. More often than not, I find GUI tools
more trouble than they are worth and clumsier than a command line,
but this one is much easier. I don't have to remember the different
whois servers, I can just select one, type in the domain name and
get back my answer&mdash;good implementation. Required libraries are
libgtk.so.1, libgdk.so.1, libglib.so.1, libXi.so.6, libXext.so.6,
libX11.so.6, libm.so.6, libc.so.6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0b30"></a>X Northern
Captain:http://www.xnc.dubna.su</h2></div></div><p>Seldom does a GUI file manager come along that gets my
attention. While XNC won't replace &ldquo;Midnight Commander&rdquo; for me,
it does have some nice features. This file manager will appeal to
the graphic artists in the Linux community. It has a built-in
viewer for several graphics formats as well as an &ldquo;mc&rdquo; style
ability to peer into tar.gz files. You'll need extra graphics
development libraries to compile in all the graphics support.
Required libraries are libSM.so.6, libICE.so.6, libX11.so.6,
libXext.so.6, libstdc++.so.2.8 (compiled with egcs, untried by me
with gcc and its libraries), libm.so.6, libc.so.6.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0c38"></a>Web
Secretary:http://homemade.hypermart.net/websec/</h2></div></div><p>If you check out many web sites frequently, let Web Secretary
do it for you. It will highlight differences in web sites and mail
them to you. Now, if it would only mail me the text. Required
library is Perl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0d40"></a>PySol
1.11:http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/pysol.html</h2></div></div><p>This is Windows Solitaire on steroids. Fourteen games and
three variants&mdash;more games than I knew how to play. Don't worry,
the autoplay function will show you how. Great time-killer.
Required library is Python.</p></div></div>
