    Here's how to set up a web server using another freely
    available operating system, FreeBSD, a high performance,
    mature, UNIX-like system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dec3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>FreeBSD is a popular (and free) Unix-like
operating system, available from the Internet and on CD-ROM
(chiefly from Walnut Creek CD-ROM). In this respect, it shares much
with Linux, which is admittedly more popular and better documented.
</p><p>Unlike Linux, FreeBSD is (as the name implies) derived from
the popular BSD variant of Unix; many features considered standard
with Unix these days originated at the University of California,
Berkeley. These features include (among others) networking and long
file names; the networking code, in particular, is mature and high
performance. (One of the busiest sites on the Internet is
http://wcarchive.cdrom.com/, aka ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/ aka
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/ aka http://www.freebsd.org/; it runs FreeBSD
and pumps out data at an average of more than 2.5MB per second,
every second of every day.)</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process of installing
FreeBSD on a LAN, and configuring it to work as a web server, all
using free software. Although Unix is not traditionally a
user-friendly operating system, FreeBSD does have a usable
installation process (provided you read the documentation and have
a rough idea what you are doing) and requires very little
maintenance.</p><p>Before installing FreeBSD, you need to be prepared. First,
you need to know how you will choose to install the system: via
CD-ROM, NFS or FTP. CD-ROM installs are the easiest and fastest;
FTP is the most commonly-used. This requires that the computer you
are installing on have access to the Internet (either via LAN or
PPP/SLIP).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dec608"></a>Hardware Requirements</h2></div></div><p>FreeBSD needs at least an 80386-level processor, with at
least 4MB of RAM and about 150MB of disk space. Note that FreeBSD
currently requires at least 5MB of RAM for installation&mdash;but can
get by with 4MB post-install. Most popular disk controllers are
supported, including (E)IDE and several SCSI controllers. The
machine I am using is a 33MHz 80486, with 16MB of RAM and a 202MB
IDE drive. It also has an UltraStor 34f VLB SCSI controller with a
CD-ROM drive attached, and a Novell NE2000+ Ethernet card,
configured at IRQ 5 and <b  >0x280</b>.</p><p>For PCI systems, almost any DEC 21x40 and 21x41-based
Ethernet card will suffice, and both the Adaptec and NCR SCSI
controllers are well-supported. The NCR is considerably cheaper and
is well-suited to low-load systems. There is some debate as to
whether the new versions of Adaptec's SCSI cards are worth the
money for high-end systems, due to recent changes Adaptec has made.
There is also new support for DPT SCSI cards, including their RAID
controller, which may be desirable in some circumstances.</p><p>Some IDE CD-ROM drives, and proprietary CD-ROM interfaces,
are also supported. The support for those is not as good as for the
SCSI. This is true because while a SCSI driver may be quite
complex, the command set is very standard, which is not yet the
case for IDE CD-ROM drives.</p><p>You will also need a boot floppy. The boot image is available
at
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/&lt;release&gt;/floppies/boot.flp
and on the CD-ROM as /floppies/boot.flp. The release I used was
3.0-970522-SNAP. If you are creating the boot floppy under a
Unix-like system, you would use <span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span>
to create the image. For example, under FreeBSD, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=boot.flp of=/dev/rfd0a bs=18k
</pre><p>A similar command is used on other Unix systems. If you are
creating the floppy under MS-DOS, you will need the rawrite.exe
file, which is located in .../tools/rawrite.exe on both the FTP
site and CD-ROM. Create the floppy by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ..     ools\rawrite boot.flp a:
</pre>


I installed the 3.0-SNAP release, which is available on CD-ROM; it
is essentially a development snapshot, and hence isn't as stable or
mature as the other releases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dec9d0"></a>Preparing to Install</h2></div></div><p>Before beginning the installation, at least read the release
notes. The recommended files to read are INSTALL.TXT, README.TXT
and RELNOTES.TXT, all in the release's root directory.</p><p>Write down hardware information, such as the disk geometry
(heads, sectors, and cylinders)&mdash;although this is not truly
necessary, it can be useful. Also the configuration of any ISA
cards, such as SCSI and Ethernet. Last, since the machine is going
to be on a LAN, you should write down the host name, domain name,
IP address, default router IP address and name server (DNS) IP
address; this will save you a lot of frantic searching later. Note
that if you are doing an FTP or NFS install, you need the same
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1decb30"></a>Beginning Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation is begun in the same way as any other equivalent
system: put the boot floppy or CD-ROM in the drive. Press
<b  >enter</b> at the <b  >Boot:</b> prompt; if
you don't type anything, it will time out and boot
automatically.</p><p>First a scrollable menu is presented to let you decide
whether or not to configure the kernel. You can choose to skip the
configuration step, or you can enter either a visual or
line-oriented configuration program. (I recommend the visual mode,
of course.)</p><p>The kernel configuration process allows you to disable or
reconfigure most device drivers; this is invaluable if you have a
device card that is configured slightly different from what FreeBSD
has been told to expect. Some devices require destructive probes
(meaning that probing for one may confuse or disable another
device); if you know which devices are not in your system and
disable all of those, probes will be less of a concern. Please note
that PCI devices are not, currently, configurable&mdash;since they are
configured on the fly, there is no conflict, and do not need to be
re-configured or deleted.</p><p>In my case, I disabled all of the mass-storage devices that I
did not have, including the Adaptec 154x driver and the second
Western Digital controller. The Western Digital driver,
<span   class="bold"><b>wdc</b></span>, controls (E)IDE, ESDI, MFM
and RLL hard disk drives. The probe sequence for one of these
controllers takes a considerable amount of time, so disabling the
second one, _wdc1_, speeds up the boot process measurably.</p><p>The visual configuration process is fairly self-explanatory
and takes only a few seconds to go through. However, it is not, in
most cases, truly necessary. An example of when it would be
necessary: if my Ethernet card had not been configured at IRQ 5,
I/O port <b  >0x280</b>, memory address
<b  >0x0d8000</b>, I would need to either reconfigure the
card or change what the FreeBSD kernel expected. If you accidently
delete a driver, you can reconfigure it by switching to the
&ldquo;Inactive Drivers&rdquo; section by pressing <b  >tab</b> and
pressing <b  >enter</b> to re-enable it.</p><p>After you've finished the kernel configuration, press
<b  >Q</b>, answer the question that appears and watch
the system boot. On a slow system, you can watch the kernel
messages being issued and ensure that all of the desired devices
have been found. Or, you can press the scroll-lock key when they
begin to scroll, and when the kernel is done probing, you will be
able to scroll the display up and down using the arrow keys and
page up/page down.</p><p>You will now be presented with a text menu (in color, if you
are on a color CGA or VGA monitor). (See Figure 1.)</p><p><a href="2515f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. The
Initial Install Menu</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1ded210"></a>Read the Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The first item in the menu is &ldquo;Usage&rdquo;, which explains how
to move through the menu system and which keys do what. This is a
must-read for any first-time installer. Press
<b  >enter</b>, and you will be presented with the &ldquo;HOW
TO USE THIS SYSTEM&rdquo; screen. (See Figure 2.)</p><p><a href="2515f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Selecting Item 1 in the initial menu brings up this
screen.</b></span></a></p><p>The next menu item is &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo;, which provides a
brief overview of FreeBSD, the supported hardware, installation
guide, etc. These files are available on the CD-ROM's root
directory, as well as in the release's root directory in the FTP
location.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1ded4d0"></a>Choosing Your Options</h2></div></div><p>The third menu item is &ldquo;Options&rdquo;, and mostly applies to
non-CD-ROM installs&mdash;NFS and FTP. In particular, if you need to use
an FTP name other than <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> (e.g.,
anonymous or even a non-anonymous account name). (See Figure
3.)</p><p><a href="2515f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Installation Process Options</b></span></a></p><p>The easiest way to get started is to choose the &ldquo;Novice&rdquo;
installation method (the fourth item of the main menu). The first
thing this does is partition the disk for you, using a
screen-oriented <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> program. The
&ldquo;Express&rdquo; method isn't as verbose with explanations&mdash;and is
probably the best way to install if you've done FreeBSD installs
before. (See Figure 4.)</p><p><a href="2515f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Express Install Screen</b></span></a></p><p>For simplicity's sake, I chose to use the entire disk for
FreeBSD by typing <b  >A</b>&mdash;it then asked if I wanted
to have a &ldquo;true partition&rdquo; entry. This is necessary if the disk
will be used in a mixed-OS, dual boot machine (e.g., both DOS and
FreeBSD). Since the machine in question will only be used as a web
server, I answered no. (See Figure 5.) Note that if you are using
BIOS geometry mapping, this may very well be required. As always,
type <b  >Q</b> when done.</p><p><a href="2515f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. Disk
Geometry Screen</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x1dedb00"></a>Partitions vs. Slices</h2></div></div><p>FreeBSD can work with DOS-style partitions, and it can use
its own partitions as well. FreeBSD calls the former &ldquo;slices&rdquo; in
order to avoid confusion, although it doesn't necessarily succeed.
In general, BSD partitions reside inside DOS-style partitions (aka
&ldquo;slices&rdquo;). The normal name for a disk is
&lt;device&gt;&lt;unit&gt;&lt;partition&gt;, e.g., wd0a; the slice
is added after the unit, and before the petition. For example,
wd0s1e would be the first slice (starting at 1, not 0), fifth
partition within that slice, of the first IDE drive. FreeBSD can
automatically partition the slice for you; on my 202MB drive, it
chose:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/       32MB
swap    41MB
/var    30MB
/usr    98MB
</pre><p>You can choose your own sizes, of course. I chose the
defaults which are quite reasonable.
</p><p>After deciding on the layout of the disk, the next step is to
choose which type of system to install. The options range from
minimal to complete, with most people selecting something in
between. For this install, the most likely type would have been
&ldquo;Basic&rdquo;, which would install the basic FreeBSD system; however, I
also prefer to configure my kernel to edit out unnecessary devices,
so I chose the &ldquo;kernel developer&rdquo; package&mdash;this is the basic
package, with compiler tools and the kernel sources. When
installed, it used up approximately 130MB of disk space.</p><p>When selecting the package (by pressing the space bar), you
are immediately asked if you want to install the DES packages. This
is desirable, as you can share password file entries with
traditional Unix systems this way. However, the default FreeBSD
password encryption scheme (MD5 checksumming, actually) appears to
be stronger than DES. Note that you are not supposed to install DES
unless you are in the USA or Canada due to export restrictions,
although the packages are included on the CD-ROM.</p><p>In addition to the basic DES package (the static and shared
libraries), you can choose to install Kerberos (an authentication
suite developed at MIT), as well as the sources to each. Although I
generally use Kerberos, I did not install it on this machine, as
space was getting tight and configuring Kerberos is not
easy.</p><p>The install program then asks if you want to install the
ports collection; this is fairly small (about 10MB), but since
space was so tight I did not install it. There is more about ports
and packages later later.</p><p>At this point, you are presented with the &ldquo;Choose
Distributions&rdquo; menu again; if you are satisfied with your choices,
press <b  >return</b> to continue, otherwise, choose the
distribution type you wish and continue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e6118"></a>Installation Media Choices</h2></div></div><p><a href="2515f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6. Media
Choice Screen</b></span></a></p><p>The next choice is what kind of media to use for the install.
(See Figure 6.) I chose to use the CD-ROM method, as it is faster,
easier and more convenient than the others. However, you can also
install via NFS and FTP (and passive FTP&mdash;this is required if you
are behind a firewall that has been configured by a paranoid
administrator). For FTP installs, it uses the account name chosen
in the &ldquo;Options&rdquo; section mentioned previously. Last, you can also
install via an existing file system (e.g., an MS-DOS file system),
floppy or tape. To use tape, you must have one of the tape drives
supported by FreeBSD&mdash;mostly SCSI tapes, but also Wangtek and a
couple of others.</p><p>If you choose to do an FTP install, you have to select the
site to grab the files from&mdash;the default is the &ldquo;Primary Site&rdquo;,
which is ftp://ftp.freebsd.org (aka http://wcarchive.cdrom.com/).
There are also mirrors around the world.</p><p>When doing an FTP or NFS install, you also need to configure
the networking interface. You're presented with all of the
networking interfaces that the system found&mdash;any networking cards
it recognized, as well as SLIP, PPP and the parallel-port IP
interface (PLIP). Help is available at the &ldquo;Network interface
information required&rdquo; menu by pressing <b  >f1</b>. One
quick note: the SLIP and PLIP options assume that the connection
will be a hard-wired connection&mdash;if you need to connect using a
modem, PPP is the only possible method.</p><p>After selecting the network interface (e.g., ed0), you will
need to tell the install program the host name and domain name,
default router (aka the &ldquo;gateway&rdquo;), name server, IP address and
any extra options. Note that the gateway and name server fields
need to be IP addresses, not host names. You will need to enter
this information again, when doing post-install
configuration.</p><p>If you selected the PPP interface, you will be asked to
configure it. This requires knowing what baud rate to use (it
defaults to 115200) and the IP address of the remote side. By
default, it uses the gateway address, if you supplied it; you can
also tell it to use &ldquo;0&rdquo;, which will allow it to be negotiated as
part of the PPP connection setup. After you've done all this, you
are then told to switch to VTY3 (the third virtual console screen),
where the PPP program has been started. From there, you need to
connect to the PPP server you are using (e.g., dialing the modem,
entering account and password information, etc.).</p><p>After that, all that was necessary was to wait while the
system installed. On my slow 486DX-33, with an IDE drive and a
double-speed SCSI CD-ROM drive, it took 16 minutes to install all
of the packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e6538"></a>System Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The install program then asks if you'd like to configure the
network devices and, if so, which ones. This is identical to what
was done if a network installation of any sort was done. In the
case of the install I did, there was only one interface to
configure: ed0. FreeBSD prompts for host and domain names, network
gateway, name server and IP address. The netmask defaulted
correctly, although you can change it if necessary. There is also a
box for &ldquo;Extra options&rdquo;&mdash;some cards may require link-level
options to choose which interface pair, e.g., BNC or Twisted, to
use.</p><p>The next questions asked are about, Samba, IP forwarding,
anonymous FTP, and NFS configuration. Of these, the only one I
chose to configure was anonymous FTP, as this is sometimes useful
for a web server. If my network had more (or, for that matter, any)
Windows systems, Samba would allow file and printer sharing. If the
machine were going to be my router, I would have enabled IP
forwarding.</p><p>The last three system configuration questions are system
console configuration (e.g., screen saver, font, keyboard map,
etc.), time zone and mouse. This particular machine does not have a
mouse; if it did, it would be possible to enable text cutting and
pasting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e66f0"></a>Installing the Web Server</h2></div></div><p>The last thing to do is install any desired packages. FreeBSD
has quite a considerable set of packages and ports; this is, in
fact, one of the most attractive attributes of FreeBSD, in addition
to its high performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e67f8"></a>Ports vs. Packages</h2></div></div><p>Ports and packages are very similar; the only difference is
in what is included in the file. A package is a gzipped tar file
containing all of the files needed, along with some description and
checksum files. A port, on the other hand, consists of patches, and
a pointer to the location on the Internet of the main files. Many
ports are built on the local system after applying source patches.
Some, however, are &ldquo;ports&rdquo; because they are commercial programs
and cannot be distributed via CD-ROM or Walnut Creek's FTP
site.</p><p>The only package I chose to install was the Apache package in
the WWW category. This took only a few seconds to install from
CD-ROM, and it then went on to finish system configuration:
additional accounts, setting the root password and registering.
(Registering sends e-mail to the FreeBSD project and is not
necessary. It does help the project, though.)</p><p>Once all that is done, the installation process is complete,
and you can exit to reboot. When your machine comes back up, your
FreeBSD system should now be on the network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e69b0"></a>Post-install Configuration</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned above, I always configure my kernels to trim
away any unneeded devices. This is similar to what was done during
the visual configuration process but is done by compiling the
kernel, it results in a smaller kernel, requiring less
memory.</p><p>The FreeBSD Handbook describes this process in detail. The
Handbook is available on the FreeBSD web page, at
http://www.freebsd.org/ and is also installed in /usr/share/doc/,
in HTML. In simplest terms, you do the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /sys/i386/conf
cp GENERIC &lt;machine name&gt;
vi &lt;machine name&gt; #edit the file and exit vi
config &lt;machine name&gt;
cd ../../compile/&lt;machine name&gt;
make depend all
cp kernel /kernel
reboot
</pre><p>The complicated part is in the editing of the configuration
file. After dealing with the visual configuration utility, the
configuration file should not be all that complicated. (It is
documented in the Handbook.) You can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>dmesg</b></span> command to see which devices
were found and which were not. By default, the installation leaves
a copy of the generic kernel in /kernel.GENERIC; you can boot this,
or any other kernel, by typing the name of the kernel at the Boot:
prompt.
</p><p>In addition to removing or configuring devices, system
parameters can also be configured this way. One such parameter,
<b  >maxusers</b>, controls how much memory the kernel
allocates to certain resources&mdash;the maximum number of processes,
open files, and time events are all calculated based on
<b  >maxusers</b>. Another parameter that may need to be
changed is <b  >MAXMEM</b>&mdash;due to BIOS limitations,
FreeBSD only recognizes up to 64MB of RAM by default (or 16MB on
some very old systems), and MAXMEM (specified in KB) tells it to
use more.</p><p>For example, on a machine with 256MB of RAM, which is
expected to have a heavy load, the following lines in the
configuration file might be used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
maxusers        100
options         MAXMEM="(256*1024)"   # 256MB
</pre><p>Once again, after editing the appropriate configuration file,
run <span   class="bold"><b>config</b></span> and then
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e6f30"></a>Making the Web Server Useful</h2></div></div><p>The Apache package installs the configuration files into
/usr/local/etc/apache, and the default configuration files have a
document root of /usr/local/www/data. By creating an index.html
file in that directory, the web server is now up.</p><p>For me, the machine was completely installed, configured and
acting as a web server on my LAN in about two hours. Most of that
time was spent waiting for the kernel to recompile; it took 90
minutes on this machine (it takes about six and a half minutes on
my 133MHz Pentium)&mdash;and the system was working as a web server
during that period.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf4580.0x21e7090"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I have installed FreeBSD several times. The process is fairly
painless, largely intuitive and very quick when done from a CD-ROM.
My main objection is that it lacks a help option for many of the
dialog boxes or menus; this can make it difficult to know what to
do if you are new to Unix. However, ignoring that, the install went
smoothly and required no knowledge of Apache configuration or
installation on my part. If I hadn't chosen to reconfigure the
kernel, I would have had a fully-functioning web server within
about 30 minutes of beginning installation.</p><p><a href="2515s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
