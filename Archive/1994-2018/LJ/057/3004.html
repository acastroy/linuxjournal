package featuring true 3-D modeling, solids and spatial analysis,
2-D to 3-D and 3-D to 2-D projection and extrusion, parametric
symbol and mechanical part libraries and surface development
utilities. It can be installed as a stand-alone application or on a
server and networked in peer-to-peer and client-server
configurations. The Linux version offers additional file security
with <span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span>. For the price, it
delivers a strong value; however, a learning curve is involved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2749580.0x2841a28"></a>Knobs, Levers and Switches</h2></div></div><p>At the interface level, VariCAD resembles Microstation95 with
a multitude of icons and sub-menus in both static display and
windowed groups. The top menu bar is generic, with pull-down and
side menus. Most of the available functions are presented in both
the icons and menu bars. While you work, the menu choices and icons
change functionality relative to your working environment. Menus,
sub-menus, icons and sub-icons are easily customized by editing
separate text configuration files. In a networked environment, each
user is able to customize his own menus and icons to his liking.
The layout of the screen worked reasonably well for my work style.
I was inclined to use the menu bar more at the beginning and the
icons later on, once I better understood the meanings of the icon
symbols.</p><p>The icons are arranged in a column matrix, loosely separated
into two sections with active functions at the top and function
group selection icons at the bottom. Changing the group of active
functions is a simple matter of selecting one of the function group
icons. Some of the function group icons also launch floating icon
windows. I found the tool tips to be a great help in deciphering
the icon glyphs.</p><p>The command line at the bottom of the window reminded me of
AutoCAD, but that is the only resemblance. The acronyms varied from
those I knew in AutoCAD. Selecting a menu item or icon causes the
associated acronym to be displayed on the command line. Commands
can also be entered manually using acronyms. Additional parameters
are either entered as single letter, digit or symbol options, or by
interactive selection of drawing and solid objects.</p><p><a href="3004f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.

program and VariCAD ships with several well-crafted samples of the
program features. From those files, I was able to get a rough idea
of performance and capabilities. Both 2-D and 3-D files loaded
quickly on my 200MHz machine with the 3-D samples taking slightly
longer to load, depending on the number of elements involved.
Overall, I was satisfied with the graphic display quality, but
VariCAD lacks the ability to export a rendered image to a standard
graphics file format. To send a concept picture by e-mail, a
separate utility must be used to create the snapshot file. As far
as printed quality is concerned, VariCAD scores excellent. The
lines are crisp and the text is clear, even on a dot-matrix
printout. Since your output may vary, VariCAD includes all of the
popular drawing size formats in both metric and ANSI.</p><p><a href="3004f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.

a blank slate was another matter. As each new experience has a
learning curve, I expected some level of difficulty in getting
started, but I found the VariCAD learning curve to be closer to
that of CATIA than to Microstation95 or AutoCAD. As a member of
that group of people who jumps right into working with software
without reading the manual, I ran into some problems with symbology
and default settings. The default sizes of the icons were too small
for my old monitor to show clearly. Once I learned how to enlarge
them, the symbology became easier to decipher.</p><p><a href="3004f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
On-line Manual</b></span></a></p><p>The on-line manual was instrumental in helping me learn to
modify the icon characteristics and other tasks during the review
process. Pop-up tool tips were also quite helpful, but I would
still like to see VariCAD offer a printed quick reference guide for
the icon graphics. I am also one of those people who likes a
printed page for reference, so I was happy to discover the on-line
manual can be spooled to a printer or text file. I also found the
search engine left something to be desired in that it did not
effectively return results on multiple keyword searches. Overall,
the manual appears to be complete, with a few translation, grammar
and spelling errors throughout the document.</p><p>At first, I found working in VariCAD's 3-D environment to be
awkward and unforgiving. The error messages that resulted from
missed picks were annoying. Even CATIA will ignore missed picks and
allow the user to try again without interrogation. I like the
mouse-driven zoom and pan features, which make working on a large
area easy. I missed the presence of an axis displayed at 0,0,0 with
the vectors labeled X,Y and Z. The reliance on colors for
identification of the axis vectors will make using the product
difficult for color-blind users.</p><p>VariCAD recommends constructing the geometry for the solids
first, then projecting the finished product into the 2-D drawing.
This approach makes sense because the projected geometry does not
automatically update when the parent solid is modified. Overall,
the solids module is comprehensive and includes features such as
moment of inertia, interference and material properties analysis in
addition to solid merging, subtraction and compound surface
manipulation features. I liked the &ldquo;Bill Of Material&rdquo; feature,
because it makes it possible to specify the materials and parts
&ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;.</p><p>VariCAD comes with extensive parametric part and symbol
libraries. If you need a 2-inch long 1/4-20 bolt included in your
design, it is a simple matter of defining the parameters in a
dialog box and then placing the resulting part in either 2-D or 3-D
modes. The modular design philosophy behind the &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo;
feature is becoming more popular, so VariCAD is right in stride
with the trend. This feature gives you the ability to design
individual components in small separate files and then assemble
them in a &ldquo;collector&rdquo; drawing file.</p><p>Finally, VariCAD features DXF and IGES file format import and
export capabilities for easy communication between other popular
CAD packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2749580.0x28424d0"></a>In Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>VariCAD is powerful and efficient with a long history of
development. VariCAD celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1998. The
people at VariCAD have elevated rapid development to a science. In
the past six months, they have released three versions of VariCAD,
and by the time this review is printed, they will have released a
few more. October 1998 was the most recent release date, with major
improvements in the area of 3-D to 2-D associativity as well as
other enhancements. VariCAD is a work in progress and continues to
improve with each new release.</p><p><a href="3004s1.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p></div></div>
