Regarding Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column in the March 2009 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>:
as you have been using UNIX nearly as long as I have, you probably already
know this.
The early UNIX spell program used a pipeline very similar to the one you
develop in your column. Its purpose was to get a list of unique words
from the document, sorted and single case.
The rest of it used comm(1) to compare the document word list to a small
system dictionary, /usr/lib/dict/words. I say small, as it had only about
25,000 entries.
</p><p>
One significant difference between the spell pipeline and yours was the
handling of the tr(1) commands. Like your pipe, one tr did upper &rarr; lower
translation. But, the second tr used options you did not mention in the
article: -c and -s (complement and squeeze). Using today's syntax, that
it would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tr -cs [:lower:] '\n'
</pre>
</p><p>
By complementing the lowercase class, this style ensures that no punctuation,
white space, digits, control chars and so on are missed. All are translated into
newlines, and where multiple sequential newlines result (that is, blank
lines),
they are squeezed out by the -s option.
</p><p>
I notice from your <tt  >uniq -c</tt> output that blank lines are the second-most
frequent &ldquo;word&rdquo;.

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for your note, Jon. You're right, using a bit

Regarding Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Secure Squid Proxy, Part I&rdquo; in the
April 2009 issue:
great article, Mick! However, I just wanted to draw some attention to the
information in the &ldquo;Just How Intelligent Is a Web Proxy&rdquo; 
sidebar. It isn't necessarily true that &ldquo;contents of HTTPS sessions are, in
practical terms, completely opaque to the Web proxy&rdquo;. Some proxy software
now has the ability to initiate a man-in-the-middle attack, issuing fake
SSL certificates on the fly to enable the proxy to impersonate the remote
server. This enables the proxy to inspect the traffic going
between the client and server. Most browsers will detect this on-the-fly
cert (generating a warning to the user), as it usually doesn't come from a
valid Certificate Authority, but some companies are using tools, such as
Group Policy, to push down custom CA settings within their organizations to
configure the browsers to accept the on-the-fly certs as genuine (without
throwing a warning).

As I continue to search the forums for the issues I am having with a
Linux desktop install, it seems that the Linux desktop (for me) still ranks
as a hobby; Linux lacks a desktop that I can use in business. Linux has the
applications&mdash;that's not the issue, desktop stability is. I think
Linux on the desktop is up and coming, but there are still unresolved issues&mdash;look at the forums and the number of issues that go unresolved.
I am not a Windows zealot by any means and run a lot of Linux in the server
environment (where it rocks!), but I have yet to have a Linux desktop
install that just works out of the box. When you install Windows, you know
what you're getting, warts and all, but it does work. It seems 
Linux
lacks a level of stability and requires a level of experience that I
don't have time for. Windows does not seem to have these issues and is why
I continue to say that Windows wins the desktop war. Some will ask &ldquo;what distro
are you running, or what hardware platform are you installing on?&rdquo;
Or, they will say 
there is something I am doing wrong, and there probably is, but all I am
looking for is usability so I can make a living. I will continue to search
the forums and continue hoping that a stable Linux desktop OS emerges.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kulmacet   <br><br>
</p><p>
I sound like a broken record when I keep saying this, but again, one of the
weaknesses Linux has as a desktop operating system is the diversity we have.
Linux can (and does) mean so many different things.
Are you using a popular desktop distribution? By that, I mean one
tailored for desktop use as opposed to server and/or corporate use?
Distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, OpenSUSE and a few others have
a better track record for desktop stability and usefulness. Since you
mention that applications aren't the problem, it makes me scratch my head,
because stability is usually where Linux ROCKS. Feel free to drop
me an e-mail with more specifics, and I'll see what I can do to help
(<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>).&mdash;Ed.

Regarding James Gray's response to Jim Leuba in the April 2009 Letters:
you may want to omit the political &ldquo;Climate Change&rdquo; nonsense. While I'm
sure you eat it up with the spoon Al Gore sold you in exchange for carbon
credits, the rest of us out here in the ether don't want to hear it. Stick
to geek-speak and keep your audience.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Seth Miller  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>James Gray replies:</b></span>
While the decisions regarding how to respond to climate change&mdash;or not to
respond to it&mdash;are political, the fact that climate change is occurring is
not. The Theory of Global Climate Change is one supported by huge amounts
of empirical data and enjoys near unanimous consensus among climatologists.
You can read more about it in documents published by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which summarizes the findings of
climatologists around the world (<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch" target="_self">www.ipcc.ch</a>).
</p><p>
Your reference to Al Gore suggests that I am a person who does not analyze
evidence before making a decision. This I do not appreciate. Because you
don't know me, you have no idea how I make my decisions. However, the
scientific literature I have read on climate change, and not bombastic
rhetoric from blowhard opinionators, is the basis for my writings on the
topic.
</p><p>
Regarding your advice to &ldquo;stick to the geek-speak&rdquo;, I would argue that I am
doing so. In most of the &ldquo;green&rdquo; pieces I write, I discuss solutions to
the challenge of reducing energy consumption in the data center.
Discussions of climate change is simply part of the rationale that I offer
for taking on such challenges.

I usually enjoy Shawn Powers' articles, but I feel that his editorial was a bit
misleading [&ldquo;Free to a Good Home: Junk&rdquo;, in the UpFront
section of the May 2009 issue]. The idea of recycling old computers into the hands of those
who need them is great:
&ldquo;Don't worry about running out of hardware, the local school district
likely has parts piled in closets in would love for you to
'recycle'.&rdquo;
I work for my local school district and had the same thought. I quickly
received a lot of flack from the people at the top and discovered it is
easier for them to trash computers than to give them away. As a result, I
started a 501(c)(3) at reglue.org (Recycled Electronics and Gnu/Linux Used for
Education). A lot of things did and didn't happen. I quickly had a lot of
CRTs; I didn't have nearly as many working mainboards with RAM to couple
them with. I also quickly discovered that sometimes it's hard to give
stuff away.
</p><p>
On a lighter note, I know someone who has been a lot more successful with
refurbishing and giving away computers than I&mdash;Helios from the Helios
Project (<a href="http://www.heliosinitiative.org/news.php" target="_self">www.heliosinitiative.org/news.php</a>). He's also the author
of the blog about the teacher and the Knoppix CD.
</p><p>
He and others are working to create a nation-wide (originally, just in
Austin) Linux Against Poverty drive and installfest on August 1, 2009
(<a href="http://geekaustin.org/2009/02/01/linux-against-poverty" target="_self">geekaustin.org/2009/02/01/linux-against-poverty</a>).
Maybe you'll consider coordinating your own Linux Against Poverty
installfest.
</p><p>
As a side note: no one is really interested in having a computer without
Internet access. Community-based mesh networks are a great idea. I think
those distributing computers might want to help others access
the Internet&mdash;the greatest cleft in the Digital Divide
(<a href="http://wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English" target="_self">wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English</a> and 
<a href="http://freifunk-texas.net" target="_self">freifunk-texas.net</a>). 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
D Davis  <br><br>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> easier to throw stuff away. That doesn't mean
the school wouldn't love to give stuff away, just that it's difficult.
Unless we break some ground and push for some new policies, those
computers will continue to be thrown away instead of put to better use.
If I misled you into thinking it would be easy, I do apologize. Also,
as a big coincidence, I'm actually writing this response on Earth Day.
It seems all the more important that we do make the effort, however
difficult, to get the piles of usable computers into the hands of those
who can use them. I'm speaking to myself as much as anyone, because in
my school district, it's much easier to dispose of hardware than to give
it away. That just has to change. Thanks for your comments. Hopefully,
with people like us willing to do the grunt work, some real change can
take place.&mdash;Ed.

Kyle Rankin had a great article in the March 2009 issue: &ldquo;When Disaster
Strikes: Hard Drive Crashes&rdquo;. Good stuff there, and &ldquo;Linux
Hacks&rdquo; has
saved my backside more than once.
</p><p>
It has been my observation that most of my drive failures, particularly in
laptops, involve heat. By cooling the drive, it is sometimes possible to
pull an image&mdash;often an error-free image&mdash;before the unit fails entirely.
If a drive won't run long enough to pull an image, sometimes it is
possible to extract important files quickly.
</p><p>
I wrap them in anti-stat plastic and freeze them for a couple hours.
Once out of the freezer, I leave them wrapped to avoid condensation,
sandwich with gel-pacs, connect directly to a host machine, or via USB to
SATA/PATA adapter, and pull an image as quickly as possible. Rinse and
repeat as necessary.
I'm about 70% with this technique. Your mileage may vary.
Great article and great magazine. Keep it up.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bill   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Ah, the famous freezer trick! I admit I have used that one
myself a few
times, although I've always wondered how much of it was science and how much
was voodoo. Either way, when one's data is at stake, I think most people are
willing to try anything that works (just look out for condensation on the
drives if you live in a humid environment).

I enjoy your magazine, though the increased attention given to JavaScript
and browser-based technologies seems somewhat off-topic for a magazine
about an operation system. My preference is for more system-related
content. Still, I understand that &ldquo;Web anything&rdquo; is a hot topic, and often
the JavaScript articles are informative.
</p><p>
However, if you are going to cover AJAX, please get the facts straight. In
whatever number of articles you have published about AJAX, I don't think
you've ever correctly explained where it came from. The May 2009
Point/Counterpoint column was especially glaring. Bill Childers says,
&ldquo;AJAX is
a newish Web technology (Google Maps came out with it in 2005...)&rdquo;.
Mr Childers, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, should do a bit of
research. Although the
magazine makes no secret of its distaste for all things Microsoft, you
really need to give credit where it's due. As painful as you may find
this, AJAX is a Microsoft creation.
</p><p>
The XMLHTTP object (later named XMLHttpRequest) was first available in
IE5 in the late 1990s. It was created by the developers of an Outlook Web
client. It was later copied by the Mozilla team and other browser
developers. The increased availability of high-speed Net access, plus the
adoption of XMLHttpRequest by multiple browser vendors, opened the door
for developers at companies such as Google to start using it in more
mainstream Web applications. And, of course, it really hit the big time
when Jesse James Garrett coined the AJAX acronym.
</p><p>
Rampant Microsoft bashing makes <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> look a little silly, but
inaccurate technical details makes you look plain bad. Whatever
justification there may be to dislike Microsoft the company, please do not
short-change the many good Microsoft developers who have done interesting
and valuable work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
James Britt  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill Childers replies:</b></span>
Thank you very much for the clarification on the origins of AJAX. You are
absolutely correct about the history of the XMLHTTP object and how it
became the XMLHttpRequest object. It was finally mostly
&ldquo;standardized&rdquo; in
2006 when the W3C released the first draft spec for the object.
</p><p>
Although all that is historical fact, the practical matter is that
Point/Counterpoint is meant to be a view into the differing opinions of two
techies. It's not meant to be a heavy technical piece. The comment that
Google Maps utilized AJAX in 2005 was meant to be taken as that's when AJAX
&ldquo;hit the big time&rdquo;. It certainly wasn't the first use of it, but it was the
one of the first places that used it in a new and unique way. Millions of
people saw and ogled over the fact that the map could be dragged about with
the mouse, and with that, Google Maps set a new standard for Web apps, in my
opinion.
</p><p>
Please note that there was only one mention of Microsoft in the column, and
it was with respect to feature creep. It wasn't &ldquo;rampant Microsoft
bashing&rdquo;, nor was it targeted at its engineers. I'm sure the coders who
work for Microsoft are hard-working, respectable folks who put their pants
on one leg at a time, just like us Linux folks do. It sounds like you may
have a cross to bear toward some past anti-Microsoft writings. May I
suggest you withhold your rancor for a Point/Counterpoint where Kyle and I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> bash Microsoft? I'm sure that will be on our list at some point, as Kyle
and I have no sacred cows.
</p><p>
At any rate, I thank you for bringing some history on AJAX to our readers.

Whoever wrote the May 2009 &ldquo;They Said It&rdquo; column in UpFront saw
fit to include quotes by Marx and Lenin.
Why go half-baked? Allow me to submit a few more choice quotes for the
next
issue, in chronological order:
</p><p>
&ldquo;Western intellectuals that profess admiration for Communism are
suspect....They are objective traitors to their class and to their interests, and
must
be treated as such....After their final victory in Western Europe and
America, revolutionary forces will eliminate all bourgeois
traitors.&rdquo;&mdash;Lenin
</p><p>
&ldquo;Death solves all problems&mdash;no man, no problem.&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph Stalin
</p><p>
&ldquo;The only good bourgeois is a dead bourgeois.&rdquo;&mdash;Pol Pot
</p><p>
I could go on, but I think you are starting to see my point.
</p><p>
Marx and Lenin are responsible for some of the most horrible
dictatorships
in
history. And those are the people you chose to quote. Kudos. What
elegance, what taste! Truly, you outdid yourself.
</p><p>
I am extremely disappointed in you and your journal. I have been reading
