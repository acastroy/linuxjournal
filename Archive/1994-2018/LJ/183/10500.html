When my kids were young, it was difficult for me to convince them that penguins
were birds. Frankly, they don't look much like birds. They don't exactly
sit on bird feeders. Heck, they don't even fly. When they are waddling
around in the snow, penguins look gangly and awkward. It's not until you
see them in the water that their beauty and elegance really shines.
Although
I'm not suggesting Linux is awkward, there are some environments in which
it really shines. Mobile devices are one of them.
</p><p>
This month, we're covering the whole gamut of mobile Linux. Alexander
Sirotkin shows us how to bend Google Android to our will with the Java API.
Marcel Gagn&eacute; shows us a bit about syncing data from our non-Linux
BlackBerry handsets with our Linux desktops. Most smartphones lack native
Linux software, but thankfully, Funambol fills that gap nicely and supports
many different mobile devices. If you have a smartphone, you'll want to
check it out.
</p><p>
One of the frustrations of using mobile Linux devices is that the screens
(if they have one) are really small. David Harding shows us the nuances of
the Conkeror Web browser on small screens. Thankfully, more and more
Web sites are being designed for the mobile-sized browser, but a flexible
browser still is a great asset on tiny screens. Heck, with Linux, mobile
computing doesn't even need screens. Federico Lucifredi shows us how to
hack the Western Digital MyBook II. With a little bit of work, you'll be
able to take your own Linux server with you wherever you go. Throw a
couple in your backpack, and you could be a mobile cloud!
</p><p>
I was sure that for the mobile issue, Kyle Rankin would tell us about the time
he did system administration on his server farm from a beach somewhere in
Mexico with nothing more than an SSH prompt on his BlackBerry. I may have
been wrong with my guess, but Kyle doesn't disappoint this month. He deals
with the horrible mistake many of us have made: typing a command
remotely into the wrong server. As someone who accidentally has typed his
password in an instant message window to someone by mistake, I'd advise
reading his column. Twice.
</p><p>
Daniel Bartholomew is back this month to show us Kindle 2. The
differences between that and the new Kindle DX are fairly easy to see (basically, it's
huge). But, there are some significant differences between the original Kindle
and the new regular-sized model too. Daniel compares the two and explains
the pros, cons and general interesting things Amazon is offering in its
Linux-based devices. If music or audio is more interesting than reading to
you, Dan Sawyer tells us all about Indamixx, a recording studio you can
take with you on the go. There may be some inappropriate places to set up
your mobile studio, but with Indamixx, the problem won't be portability.
</p><p>
Fear not; this month we still have our regular lineup of columns to scratch
that geeky itch. Dave Taylor demonstrates using getopt in shell
scripts to parse the start flags. Reuven M. Lerner shows us how to check our
Ruby code with metric_fu, and Mick Bauer continues his series on building a
secure Squid proxy. This
issue focuses on mobile Linux, but as with every other month, we aim to
please everyone.

I suppose <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> itself is a good example of mobility. Feel free to
take this issue with you wherever you go. If you subscribe to the digital
edition, you might be reading this on a laptop right now. My only
suggestion would be that regardless of which format you are reading, try
not to get carried away. Penguins might be able to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; underwater, but
unless you have a Linux-powered submarine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is best enjoyed on
dry ground.
