A review of the sleek, slim, sexy successor to the Kindle.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279f580.0x2897250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Everyone knew Amazon would announce a successor to its popular Kindle
ebook reader. What people did not know was when. Thankfully, the time
between when the Kindle 2 was announced and when it started shipping
was short. Now that it has been released, it's time to put Amazon's
Linux-powered book reader to the test.
</p><p>
Like the original, the Kindle 2 is built around an e-ink display. The
dimensions of the display are the same, but every other aspect of
the device is either new or modified. Instead of being shaped like a
wedge, the Kindle 2 is a flat slab. Instead of a rubberized back, it has
brushed aluminum. Instead of angled rectangular keys in a split keyboard
configuration, it has circular keys in a rectangular grid. Instead of a
scroll wheel, it has a five-way thumbstick. Instead of four shades of gray,
it has 16. You get the idea.

Things the Kindle 2 Does Better</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with my favorite Kindle 2 improvement: battery life. Of all
the changes, this is the one I appreciate the most. With the wireless
turned on, I can use the Kindle for several days before having to charge
it. With the wireless turned off, I have to charge the Kindle only two
or three times a month. This is a vast improvement over the original
Kindle&mdash;when I did not have the charger with me, I had to be careful
never to
turn on the wireless except when I wanted to purchase something
or knew I had a subscription waiting for me to download. Turning on the
wireless on the original Kindle is a sure way to kill your battery life.
</p><p>
Another improvement is that newspapers and magazines are easier to navigate
on the Kindle 2. Instead of having to use the scroll wheel to select
links to jump between different articles, I can move the joystick to the
left or right anywhere on the page to jump between stories. Likewise,
a single click takes me to the section list.
</p><p>
Browsing Web sites also is better on the Kindle 2. The combination of
better graphics and a faster processor makes the experience tolerable. It
still could be improved, sure, but it is a definite step up from the
original. Web pages appear quicker and are much easier to navigate.
</p><p>
On the entertainment front, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Find the mines!</em></span> (aka
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span>)
game (that you can get to by pressing Alt-Shift-M) works much better on the
Kindle 2. For one thing, it's actually playable, which I consider to
be a requirement for games. The game works so well, I wish there were
more games. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> or some other word game would be nice,
for example.
</p><p>
Another improvement is that you now can attach notes to individual words,
thanks to the five-way joystick controller. The original Kindle let
you attach notes only to individual lines of text. Of course, that being said,
there aren't many instances where I have wanted multiple discrete notes
per line, but just in case I do, the feature is there. Unfortunately,
although the original Kindle can see the multiple notes per line that I
made on the Kindle 2, it can't select or edit them properly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279f580.0x2897bf0"></a>
Things the Kindle 2 Does Differently</h2></div></div><p>
The power and USB ports have been combined on the Kindle 2. The included
power adapter is really just a standard USB-A to micro USB-B cable with
a wall adapter. The use of a micro USB end instead of the more common
mini USB that the original Kindle used is a disappointment, because I
can't use the same cable to connect both Kindles to my computer. A lot
of manufacturers are moving to micro USB, because although the width of the
plug is the same compared to mini USB, it has about half the height,
which makes it easier to incorporate into thinner devices. Two years from
now, I'll probably have lots of micro USB cables, because most devices will
have moved to it, and it won't be a big deal. Right now, the cable that
came with the Kindle 2 is my only micro USB cable, so I need to keep an
eye on it. At least Amazon did not do something stupid and create its
own custom connector. I also hope more manufacturers take Amazon's lead
and combine both the data and power cables. Fewer cables is good, and the
more devices I can charge with the exact same cable, the happier I'll be.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10432f3.large.jpg"><img src="10432f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Kindle 2 plug (bottom) is much smaller
than the plug for the original Kindle.
</p></div></div><p>
There is no longer a physical button for turning the Kindle's wireless on
and off. This has both good and bad sides to it. For one, if you attempt
to do something that needs the wireless, the Kindle 2 offers to turn
the wireless on for you. On the other hand, it takes more effort to turn
the wireless off now that it is not a physical switch. It takes only a
couple clicks from anywhere in the Kindle 2 interface, so it's not a
big deal. And, with the longer battery life, I don't need to stress as
much about leaving the wireless on like I did with the original Kindle.

Things the Kindle 2 Does <span   class="emphasis"><em>Not</em></span> Do Better</h2></div></div><p>
Despite all the nifty new features, the
original Kindle did a few things better than the Kindle 2. For one, no cover is
included. Instead, you are forced to purchase one. I say forced, because
with a device this expensive and fragile, going out without a cover
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a good idea. The original Kindle's cover was not anything to
be proud of, but it was included with every Kindle, and it worked well
enough, most of the time. I happily admit that the covers are much
better this time around. They snap securely into the left side of the
Kindle 2, and I'm not worried about the Kindle 2 falling out of the cover
like I was with the original Kindle.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10432f5.large.jpg"><img src="10432f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Kindle 2's covers are nice, but they are no
longer included. You have to purchase them separately.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10432f6.large.jpg"><img src="10432f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The way the Kindle 2 attaches to the covers is
more secure than it was with the original Kindle.
</p></div></div><p>
Another thing the original Kindle did better was contrast. The
contrast between the gray-ish background and the text is just not as good
as on the original Kindle. It's hard to notice unless you have them
side by side, but if you do, it's instantly recognizable. The text on my
original Kindle is sharper, darker and easier to read than the text on
my Kindle 2. If there was one thing I wish they would have kept from the
original, the screen is it. I would happily go back to four shades of gray
if it means better contrast. I use the Kindle for reading, not looking
at gray-scale pictures, and why Amazon thought that improving picture
quality was more important than text legibility is a mystery to me.
</p><p>
There also are a few things the original Kindle had that the Kindle 2 does
not. For one, the Kindle 2 does not have a removable battery. This seems
to be a trend among consumer electronics manufacturers these days. It's a
trend I do not like. Maybe it was necessary to get the desired thinness
and battery life, but I still would prefer a removable battery. If the
battery dies on my Kindle 2, I likely will have to send it in to Amazon
to be fixed. On my original Kindle, I can replace the battery myself
and even carry around spares.
</p><p>
Another thing that got axed this time around is
the SD card slot. The
internal memory of the Kindle has been beefed up to 2GB, but that's
no excuse in my opinion. Using SD cards was one of the ways I used to
organize my growing collection of ebooks. On the Kindle 2, I can carry
them all with me, but I have to page through screen after screen to
get to a particular book. Since they have removed removable storage,
Amazon really needs to update the Kindle software to allow for some sort
of organizational hierarchy, manual or otherwise&mdash;folders, tags, genres,
whatever. Right now, things can be displayed alphabetically (by title or
author), or by how new they are. That's a poor way to organize things
if you have 100+ ebooks on your Kindle.

New Things the Kindle 2 Can Do</h2></div></div><p>
So, the question you probably are asking is &ldquo;What's new?&rdquo; The
answer is,
not a lot. There are a pair of major new features. The first of these
is Text-To-Speech (TTS). Personal computers have had TTS of varying
quality for decades. I remember toying around with a rather primitive
TTS system for Apple IIe computers back in the early 1980s, and then there
was the Macintosh that famously introduced itself using TTS, so it's
not surprising that TTS has found its way to handheld devices like the
Kindle. I have found it to be a useful feature.
</p><p>
The TTS system on the Kindle 2 is powered by RealSpeak Solo from Nuance
Communications. The quality is good, and great strides have been made in
the past few years with regard to making computer-generated male and
female voices sound more natural. It is not a replacement for an audio
book, but it does come in handy for times when I can't look at the
Kindle but still want to continue reading. While driving is the obvious
time when it would be bad to read the Kindle. I also have used the
TTS when cooking and exercising.
</p><p>
The Kindle 2 can read text at three speeds. The middle
setting works the best for me, but if I want to cruise through several
newspaper articles quickly, the fast setting does a good job. As far
as the voices go, I personally prefer the male voice. The female voice
sounds more robotic to me, but I'm sure others will feel the same way
about the male voice.
</p><p>
For all of its benefits, the TTS feature of the Kindle has not been
without controversy. As soon as it was announced, the Author's Guild cried
foul and claimed that TTS violated authors' copyrights on recorded
performances of their work. The legal validity of this claim is debatable,
but Amazon quickly moved to settle with the Guild by changing TTS through
a firmware update so TTS could be turned off at the discretion of the
rights holders.
</p><p>
In honor of the 15th anniversary of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I had the Kindle 2
&ldquo;read&rdquo; the Linus Torvalds interview from the very first issue.
It's
not perfect, and it's unintentionally funny in places,
but it does a good job overall. The .ogg file I captured is available
at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/site_files/video/interview_with_linus.ogg" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/site_files/video/interview_with_linus.ogg</a> if you want to listen to it.
</p><p>
The second major new feature is synchronization of your page position,
bookmarks and notes between devices. Now that there are multiple
versions of the Kindle out there, and a Kindle iPhone application,
it's a safe bet that people will read their Amazon ebooks on two or
more different devices. When I first turned on the Kindle 2, part of the
getting started process had me go to the Archived Items section of the
Kindle interface and download the books I had purchased previously for
my original Kindle. A week before the Kindle 2 started shipping, Amazon
made a firmware update available for the original Kindle that added the
synchronization functionality, so when I opened the books on the Kindle 2,
they opened to the page I was reading when I last had them open on my
original Kindle. All of my notes and bookmarks were there too. This made
switching to the new device painless.

Figure 9. If you have an original Kindle, you
will be prompted to download your previously purchased items.
</p></div></div><p>
The unfortunate thing about all this synchronization goodness is it 
works only with items purchased from Amazon. Books from other sources cannot
be synchronized wirelessly. I wish it weren't this way, but I can see
Amazon's reasoning. The cell network access the Kindle uses is not free,
after all, but I still don't like the synchronization not working for
non-Amazon items.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279f580.0x288f978"></a>
Hacking the Kindle 2</h2></div></div><p>
Like the original Kindle, the Kindle 2 has several hidden features.
One of these is the 411 information page. To display it, go to the main
screen, choose Settings from the menu to go to the settings page,
and then type 411. The 411 page then appears. I would include a
screenshot, but the page is filled with things like the Kindle's serial
number and other information that should not be made public.
</p><p>
Another thing the Kindle 2 has that the original Kindle had is a debug
mode. To get to the mode, bring up the search box and enter
<tt  >;debugOn</tt>,
and press the Enter key. Then, bring up the search box again, and enter
<tt  >`help</tt> to show the various debug commands that are available. There's
no documentation for what the listed commands do. And, if you break your
Kindle messing around with them, Amazon probably will consider you to
have broken your warranty.

Figure 12. Some of the dialogs that appear when
mucking around in Debug mode are less than helpful.
</p></div></div><p>
That said, one hacker found that the <tt  >`usbQa</tt> and
<tt  >`usbNetwork</tt>
commands enabled him to tether his Kindle 2 to his computer. It's not the
kind of tethering where the computer was getting its Internet access from
the Kindle 2 (like what you might do with mobile phone tethering). Instead,
the Kindle 2 was able to connect to the Internet using the network
connection of the computer. This is not terribly useful, but it's there
if you want to experiment.
</p><p>
The Kindle 2 runs Linux, and a lot of the software it uses is licensed
under the GPL or the BSD license. Some of the more interesting pieces
of software include syslog-ng, u-boot, monit, lrzsz, iptables, gstreamer,
BusyBox, dosfstools, e2fsprogs, ALSA, mtd-tools, bzip2, libpcap,
ncurses, ppp and strace. The presence of BusyBox in particular suggests
that a command-line environment of some kind should be available&mdash;if
BusyBox had the right features enabled when Amazon compiled it, which
it didn't. One hacker discovered that statically compiled Linux ARM
binaries work just fine on the Kindle 2, and he was able to replace the
onboard BusyBox with one he had compiled for the Android platform,
which had Telnet enabled. This let him Telnet into his Kindle when it
was connected to his local network via the USB tethering trick.
</p><p>
The Kindle 2 is less hackable than the original Kindle (there's no external
serial port, for example), but determined individuals have been able to
poke and prod at the hardware.
</p><p>
On the software side, there's a cat-and-mouse game currently being
played out that looks a lot like what went on a few years back with
Apple and its iTunes/iPod DRM. People are posting scripts that help
you use encrypted Mobipocket files purchased from other on-line sources,
to which Amazon responds by serving DMCA takedown notices. The scripts
then surface on different sites hours later. Amazon then changes its
DRM, which breaks the scripts. Updated versions of the scripts surface
the next day. And, the cycle keeps going.
</p><p>
There is one neat project all of this hacking has enabled that I'd like
to mention in closing: Savory. This is software that runs on the Kindle
that will convert .pdf and .epub files into Kindle-compatible .mobi
files automatically. It also updates the built-in Web browser to accept
.pdf and .epub as valid, supported media types. Battery life is impacted
with this package installed, but not by much, and the ability to navigate
to, download and automatically convert .pdf and .epub documents without
having to make a trip to my desktop computer makes it worth it.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
So, is the Kindle 2 worth it? Maybe. If you have an original Kindle,
it's a tossup. There are a lot of nice improvements, but if the
original Kindle is working for you, there really is no compelling reason
to make this a must-have upgrade. If, on the other hand, you don't have
a Kindle, the reasons and justifications for getting the original
Kindle still apply: get one if you love to read and don't like (or can't)
carry around all the books you want to read. The Kindle 2 is the best
of the current crop of ebook readers, and if you've been wanting to get
an electronic reader, you could do a lot worse than the Kindle 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279f580.0x2890478"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
My Kindle Wish List</b></p><p>
I believe the Kindle 2 is the best ebook reader on the market right now.
However, it's not perfect. Here is a list of six things I hope will
be part of the Kindle 3:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A touchscreen: a device like the Kindle <span   class="emphasis"><em>needs</em></span> a touchscreen. When I
hand the Kindle to
people to try, nine times out of ten, they will try to tap on the screen to
select an item. Every review I've read of the Kindle 2 talks about how much
better the joystick is than the scroll wheel on the original Kindle. I
say a touchscreen would have been better.
</p></li><li><p>
Folders or tags:
there needs to be a folder or tag method for organizing files. Empirical
ordering by author, title or date has its place, but for ease and speed of
access, a good logical layout works best for me (especially when I create
the layout).
</p></li><li><p>
Slide-out keyboard:
the keyboard isn't used much on the Kindle. For the 95%+ of the time when
I'm not using the keyboard, I would like it to disappear. Cell phones have
had sliding keyboards for years. It shouldn't be too difficult to add one
to the Kindle and free up space for either a bigger screen or a smaller
physical size.
</p></li><li><p>
Real keyboard keys:
while I'm on the subject of the Kindle's keyboard, the chiclet keys are
terrible. The Kindle 2 has the space&mdash;put some decently sized keys there. I
realize both this and suggestion #3 will make the Kindle thicker, and I'm
okay
with that. The Kindle still would be thinner and lighter than nearly every
book on the market. Call it the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version and charge a premium. Better
still, make the current version the &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version (and drop its price by
$100+) and sell the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version for the current price.
</p></li><li><p>
Microphone:
add a microphone to the Kindle 2 and make it possible for me to create voice
notes. Let me attach them to specific passages in books just like regular
notes.
</p></li><li><p>
Removable battery:
bring back the removable battery. Don't get me wrong, I love the extended
battery life, I just don't like that the battery is now not removable.
