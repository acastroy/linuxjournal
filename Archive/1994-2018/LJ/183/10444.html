The Indamixx portable recording studio is built around
a Linux multimedia real-time operating system
and provides an unprecedented level of software integration
and refinement for audio tasks.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dd408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You've wanted to be a record producer, right? Or, you've wanted to be able to set up and record
impromptu interviews and panels at tradeshows and conventions? What if you
could do it all, on Linux, with a couple decent mics and a device you can
carry in your pocket? Ever imagined being able to produce original content
everywhere?
</p><p>
You don't have to imagine anymore. Since November 2008, a little company
called Indamixx has been putting out just such a marvel. Built on a Samsung
Q1 Ultra chassis, this little handheld does its best to deliver on a very
impressive list of marketing promises.
</p><p>
I unwrapped this lovely little toy box and had it virtually glued to my hip
for the five weeks I reviewed it. It starts up fast; it works slick; the
physical and virtual interfaces are very well put together, functional and
fast. It did almost everything I asked of it, and its battery life was
impressive on top of it all.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10444f1.large.jpg"><img src="10444f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Indamixx/Ardour
</p></div></div><p>
In the course of my review, I edited a half-hour radio drama, recorded a
five-person roundtable podcast over Skype, did an extensive amount of blogging,
wrote two articles for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, did a couple photo shoots and
composed a couple tunes, and took it round to a club for a shakedown.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dd930"></a>
The Good</h2></div></div><p>
In terms of advertised features, the Q1 was an excellent platform to begin
with. Touchscreen-based with three USB ports and a monitor jack, it docks
easily at a desk and moves quickly with you. The screen is clear and
contrasty enough to do work on its own most of the time, at least for work where
you don't need a lot of vertical resolution (the drawback of the
ultra-widescreen aspect ratio).
</p><p>
It's very small, light and only marginally more difficult to lug around
than an iPod. At first blush, it's a hell of a little gadget.
</p><p>
Appropriate for its intended task, it has a pair of built-in stereo
microphones that do proper left/right separation and exhibit a serviceably
low noise floor for casual interviews and note taking. I put those
microphones to the test in a couple interviews and, even while driving, they
exhibited good enough discrimination for transcription. Score one for the
Indamixx.
</p><p>
Of course, those are all properties of the hardware layer, which is a
commodity device made by Samsung and can be had off the shelf for about
$800. The real genius of this box is that the folks at Trinity Audio who
designed it paid a lot of attention to detail in their choice of software
packages as well. The Q1 is a pretty anemic hardware platform from the spec
sheet, but Trinity managed to pull out every spare processor cycle from
this.
</p><p>
Pro-audio applications in all flavors of Linux&mdash;Ardour, energyXT,
Rosegarden and so on&mdash;all run atop the recursively named Jack Audio Connection
Kit (JACK), a real-time server layer that gives pro-audio apps direct,
low-latency access to the DSPs and MIDI devices. Digital Audio Workstations
(DAWs) built on Linux must play nice with JACK, and &ldquo;playing
nice&rdquo;
can be measured in two ways:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
How easy is it to get real-time performance out of JACK?
</p></li><li><p>
How many of the distribution's applications come prebuilt for JACK
compatibility?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The answer to #1 should be pretty easy, because a real-time kernel patch is
available for most distributions, and if it isn't available for yours, you
always can build it. But, it isn't all that easy. The processes your distro
runs, the other kernel modules you load and a dozen other things about
distro architecture can make the difference between a system that will
serve you well and one that will drive you bonkers. Because of this, the
various Linux distributions do so with varying degrees of success, from the
just-plain-awful vanilla SUSE to the tolerable Ubuntu Studio to the
excellent 64 Studio.
</p><p>
As for question #2, there is a similar gradient among distributions for JACK
compatibility with application packages, from the &ldquo;just about nothing
unless you compile it yourself&rdquo; end to the &ldquo;almost anything
you could
want&rdquo; end of the spectrum.
</p><p>
So, how does the Indamixx's OS, called Transmission, stack up? Not to put
too
fine a point on it, but it is hands-down the best-engineered Linux
distribution I've ever laid my eyes on. Trinity took the best-of-breed
64 Studio distro and made it better, getting every program to route through
JACK, including such normal recalcitrants as Skype and Flash&mdash;and
did it all so well that I very rarely encountered any xruns, even when
recording while I browsed the Web, and even when hooked up to notoriously slow
external USB pro-audio gear.
</p><p>
The Indamixx recognized the aforementioned pro-audio gear without batting
an eye&mdash;both the mixing surfaces and the A/D converters, and pretty
much the only thing I found myself wanting was more USB ports (advice:
use a hub with this thing). It played nice with Samba (though not NFS)
right out of the box. Its Wi-Fi found signals where both of my laptops
have trouble locking on, and even with my stubby fingers, the built-in
thumb-keyboard and touchscreen were a breeze to operate.
</p><p>
The power management features also worked without a hitch&mdash;from blanking to
sleep to hibernation, I encountered none of the problems that portable
users commonly encounter on Linux. Add that to the startup time of
less than a minute, and you've got a device that seems ideal for its advertised
ends:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Recording and mixing.
</p></li><li><p>
Building dance loops and remixes.
</p></li><li><p>
DJing.
</p></li><li><p>
Podcasting.
</p></li><li><p>
Mastering.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The Indamixx's list of software packages is no less impressive. The selection of
programs is deliberate and lean. Everything one needs to
accomplish,
virtually any audio task, as well as some video and other graphics tasks,
comes installed and built with a number of performance enhancements: GIMP,
Blender, Ardour, a portable version of Firefox, the commercial DAW program
energyXT, SHOUTcast and DJ mixing software, hundreds of LADSPA plugins, a
properly functioning VST server (another rarity on Linux),
the always-handy Skype and a boatload of remix samples and MIDI voices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26de488"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Capabilities</b></p><p>
I found that the Indamixx can comfortably maintain real time on its
internal hard disk while recording four tracks simultaneously or when playing
back four with reverb and other complicated effects applied.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26de698"></a>
The Bad</h2></div></div><p>
The Indamixx is advertised as an all-purpose DAW and is heavily marketed
to DJs and those who work with live music. That means the people most
likely to buy this device also are those most likely to use it in nightclubs and dive bars.
</p><p>
Such environments are filled with a number of hazards that, frankly, the
designers of the Q1 and those who picked it as the Indamixx platform didn't
consider. Those hazards include such things as spilled drinks,
smoke, ash and particulates from pyrotechnics, high humidity and high temperatures,
high levels of vibration (from speakers) and so on.
</p><p>
In addition, there are ergonomic issues that make working
with the Indamixx in a club situation somewhat less than optimal. Simply
put, it doesn't fit anywhere, and it's easily knocked off the edge of a
table. There is no custom mounting hardware available for it, which means
its hazard risk is at maximum in a club environment.
</p><p>
Let's face it, the Indamixx is flimsy. Despite its solid feel, the Q1 Ultra
is made of thin, brittle plastic&mdash;difficult to disassemble and upgrade
despite being user-serviceable and easy to break during service.
Similarly, its touchscreen is ill-protected and prone to scratching (not to
mention breaking if dropped), and there is no custom hard case available
for the unit that adequately protects the screen. Worse still, it's a
hard-disk-based machine, and the hard disk is neither shock-resistant nor
mounted with shock absorbers. This means that, when running, a fall from
desk height onto a hard floor has a very good chance of irrecoverably
crashing the heads. Given the purposes for which this unit is advertised,
it isn't in the least bit moisture- or smoke-resistant. Not all the ports
have protectors; there's no sealing grommet at the seams, and the
ventilation holes have no splash screen.
</p><p>
Of course, very few computers of any form factor are hardened against these
kinds of hazards, and even fewer at this price point. Because of that, it
might seem kind of petty to complain about those things, but the folks at
Trinity Audio have advertised this remarkable handheld as being suitable
for tasks that it simply can't stand up to long term, and that's not good
for anybody.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26de958"></a>
The Ugly</h2></div></div><p>
A couple other minor points about this unit just aren't
pretty, and they also have to do with the marketing literature. The
Indamixx's sales brochure advertises the ability to record at 96KHz in
32-bit float format, and although this is technically true (that is, the hard disk
will keep up with it), it implies that what you get in the box is what you
need to do this, and that simply isn't true. The unit comes with no
pro-audio interface, nor did it come with a list of compatible hardware so
that someone building a studio around this unit could select an appropriate
A/D converter (at the time of this writing, a list of such devices can be
found on the Web site, but I have no way of knowing whether the list is
included with the product).
</p><p>
The other ugly point is the price. The unit retails for just under $1,200,
which is pretty steep.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26deab8"></a>
The Verdict</h2></div></div><p>
I love the Indamixx. I wish I could afford one. I had more fun and
got more work done with this little thing than I ever expected. It has,
bar none, the best multimedia implementation of Linux I ever
have seen&mdash;the care that has gone into the software design on this unit is
nothing short of astounding.
</p><p>
The problem is, this unit is ill-adapted for the very environments I'd use
it in most: bars, nightclubs, restaurants, film sets and other rugged
on-the-go situations. It's not robust enough to do the very tasks for which it is
otherwise ideal.
</p><p>
Because of that, I can't give it my unconditional recommendation, much as
I'd like to. If you have the $1,200 to spare and need to do a lot of audio
work on business trips, planes or at conventions, this is the ideal
machine for you. If you're looking for something that'll hold up well in
hard-core production situations, you'd be better off buying the $600 laptop
model that Indamixx also sells and spending some of the balance on
hardening the machine to make it safe for the environments where you're going to
be working. Perhaps dropping some of the spare cash on a good pro-audio
interface also would be a good idea. This solution won't give you something
quite as portable, but it will give you almost all of the good points of
the Indamixx's exquisite portability and software design without being
constrained by its profound drawbacks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dec70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
How to Clean Your Gear</b></p><p>
So, someone has spilled beer on your gear, or it's gotten so gummed up with
tar and gunk that it's not working anymore. What do you do?
</p><p>
First, if the offender is a liquid, cut the power immediately. If the unit
has batteries, pop them out. If it's plugged into the mains, pull the plug.
The sooner you do this, the more likely you are to save the unit. Once this
is done, you can proceed on a non-emergency basis.
</p><p>
Second, get yourself some deionized water. It's important that you use
completely fresh water that's been filtered by deionization, rather than by
any other process. This removes all of the electrical potentiality from the
water (as well as the electrolytes), so it's safe to use to clean your
gear.
</p><p>
Third, disassemble the equipment and bathe all of the affected parts in the
water. Scrub (with a clean, static-free cloth) any tars, residues, sugars
or anything else off the gear.
</p><p>
Fourth, seal each piece in a ziplock bag or airtight container with either
uncooked rice or (preferably) silica gel to dry. Leave it there for several
days.
</p><p>
Finally, reassemble the gear, taking care not to subject it to static
discharge.
</p><p>
At this point, so long as you've put everything together
properly, your gear should once again be in perfect working order, unless
something fried during those first few seconds. This procedure works
equally well for mixing boards, amplifiers, laptop computers, hard drives
and rack gear.
