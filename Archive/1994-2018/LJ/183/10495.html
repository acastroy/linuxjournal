I've talked before about how I am a lazy shell script programmer. It
might be because I'm simply not a full-time professional software
developer, and I don't even administer my own servers anymore&mdash;I
outsource the job to Wisconsin.
</p><p>
Regardless of how much I program nowadays though, I still find myself
needing simple little applications&mdash;tiny programs that do one simple task
well.
</p><p>
And, then there are the throwaway scripts that stick around, ultimately
becoming a mainstay of one's toolkit, spreading out to cover multiple
functions and mysteriously growing to 100 lines or more.
</p><p>
I have one of those in my toolkit, a script that originally was intended
simply to figure out the dimensions of a graphic file and produce the
proper height and width attributes for an HTML image tag.
</p><p>
Now the script scale.sh has grown to 133 lines and does a variety
of different, albeit related tasks. No surprise, it's also grown to
have a variety of command-line arguments, as shown here:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ ./scale.sh

Usage: scale {args} factor [file or files]
  -a      use URL values for APparenting.com site
  -b      add 1px solid black border around image
  -i      use URL values for intuitive.com/blog site
  -k KW   add keywords KW to the ALT tags
  -r      use 'align=right' instead of &lt;center&gt;
  -s      produces succinct dimensional tags only

A factor 0.9 for 90% scaling, 0.75 for 75%, or max width in pixels.
A factor of '1' produces 100%.

</pre>
</p><p>
Crack open the code, and you'll see my dirty little scripting secret&mdash;a
very sloppy approach to parsing command-line options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$1" = "-a" ] ; then
  baseurl="www.apparenting.com/Images/"; shift
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
I did warn you that I was a lazy programmer, right? This is a pretty
classic way to parse and process command-line arguments, actually. Check
the value of $1, and if it's a known flag, change a default variable or
two, then use the shift command to move $2 &rarr; $1, $3 &rarr; $2 and so
on, effectively deleting the processed flag from the command-line args.
</p><p>
The problem is, when you have more than one or two flags, this really
doesn't work. I step through the command flags alphabetically in my
script&mdash;for example, invoking the script as <tt  >scale -r
-a</tt> will fail. It'll process the -r flag but never
see the -a and generate an error condition.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there's a very nice Linux command called getopt
that lets you parse through your command flags in a far more sophisticated
manner.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10eb930"></a>
getopt In Shell Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
The getopt command first requires that you let it rearrange how your
command flags are organized, then you use the set command to update all the
positional variables.
After that, you can step through the positional variables with a case statement.
</p><p>
The first step is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
args=`getopt FLAGS $*`
set -- $args
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10ebae8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where FLAGS should be the individual letters of known and accepted command
flags. If a flag has an argument that goes with it (like -s 30),
append a colon to it.
</p><p>
For my script, it looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
args=`getopt abik:rs $*`
set -- $args
</pre>
</p><p>
To see what happens, I've added a bonus echo statement. Here's the
result:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scale -abs -k fdsf 100 *png
args = -a -b -s -k fdsf -- 100 blooeeh.png
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, getopt separates out each and every command flag and adds a
-- flag that indicates when the command flags end&mdash;simple,
really!
</p><p>
Now that the args have been restructured, parsing is relatively easy,
though it looks pretty complicated (warning, I've stripped out a few
clauses for simplicity):

<pre     class="programlisting">
for i; do
  case "$i" in
    -a  ) baseurl="www.apparenting.com/Images/"
          shift ;;
    -k  ) keywords=" ($2)"
          shift ; shift  ;;
    -s  ) verbose=0
          shift ;;
    --  ) shift; break ;;
  esac
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's read this backward. At the -- option, the loop
will exit due to the break.
Until that's hit, the for loop will
just keep iterating, stepping through all the flags specified.
This is how the order of the flags becomes irrelevant.
</p><p>
Each time a flag is matched, the desired action is taken, variables are set
and so on, then the shift command shows up again to move all the
command flags down one (for example, $2 to $1, $3 to $2 and so on).
</p><p>
Shell script case statement matching lines are all in the form of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
regex ) actions  ;;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10ebfb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The double semicolon is an oddity, but that's how
you indicate the end of an individual case match, hence the notation shown
above.
</p><p>
Grabbing the argument for the -k flag is easy too, because
getopt has made sure that it's a separate argument, and since
we're using shift as we go along to move things around, $2 will
always be the argument itself.
</p><p>
Finally, also notice that as a stylistic approach, I have the
double semicolon with a leading space. That's just so when I eyeball
the script, I quickly can recognize if there are any cases that are missing
the double semicolon.
</p><p>
The only piece missing is some error handling, because right now, if a bad
flag is encountered, here's what happens:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scale -ax 100 *png
getopt: illegal option -- x
</pre>
</p><p>
Nice, but the script doesn't catch the error condition or stop
running&mdash;not so good.
</p><p>
To fix it, immediately after the call to getopt, simply test the
return code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then ...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff3580.0x10ec328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the conditional, you probably would put a usage statement and an exit command.
For my script, I actually also test to
ensure that there are a minimum of two arguments on the command line as well,
because the script is never valid without them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $? != 0 -o $# -lt 2 ] ; then
  echo ""
  echo "Usage: scale {args} factor [file or files]"
  echo ""

  ... stuff skipped ...

  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point in our shell script writing journey, I certainly hope you can
read that rather cryptic conditional statement and understand what it
does.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it's a bit of work to parse command-line flags the
right way, but it makes for a far more flexible and robust shell script.
