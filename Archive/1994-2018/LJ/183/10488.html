Tighten the controls on your Squid Web proxy.

We've been building a secure Squid Web Proxy the past few months, and we'll
continue to do so for a couple more. Last time [May 2009], we got Squid installed, running
and restricted to serve only local clients (based on their IP addresses).
This month, we delve deeper into Squid's Access Control List (ACL)
capabilities and other built-in security features.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb41580.0xc39618"></a>
ACL Review</h2></div></div><p>
As you may recall from my last column, all we had to do to get Squid running
on a standard Ubuntu 8.04 system was add two lines to the file
/etc/squid/squid.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
acl mick_network src 10.0.2.0/24
http_access allow mick_network
</pre>
</p><p>
We inserted those two lines, which allow outbound proxy connections from
clients whose IP addresses fall within the network 10.0.2.0/24 (that is,
addresses 10.0.2.1 through 10.0.2.254), right above Squid's default &ldquo;deny
all&rdquo; ACL, which looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http_access deny all
</pre>
</p><p>
You can correctly infer from this that, by default, Squid denies proxy
connections from all clients. This is a refreshing change in default server
application configurations during the past few years. Whereas in the past,
many applications had default configurations that would &ldquo;just
work&rdquo;, which
is a very user-friendly but also excessively open stance, nowadays few
network applications will do much of anything without
<span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
administrative intervention. This is only sensible. Connecting things to the
Internet that you don't even know how to configure is the way of
pain.
</p><p>
Getting back to our example ACL, the acl statement itself is fairly
self-explanatory: <tt  >acl</tt> tells Squid we're defining an
ACL; <tt  >mick_network</tt>
is its name; <tt  >src</tt> indicates it matches the client's source IP address or
network address; and <tt  >10.0.2.0/24</tt> is the network address in CIDR notation
that will match this ACL. 
</p><p>
This is the simplest type of ACL and still one of the most useful. In
February 2002, if the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> had had a simple source-IP/network ACL
correctly configured on its Internet-facing corporate Web proxies, the
rogue hacker Adrian Lamos couldn't have gained access quite so easily to
its editorial-page contributor database or its Lexus-Nexus portal.

ACLs in More Depth</h2></div></div><p>
Besides clients' (source) IP addresses, Squid also can match a great deal of
other proxy transaction characteristics. Note that some of these deal with
arcane HTTP headers and parameters, many of which are minimally useful for
most Squid users anyhow.

I've presented the full range of possible ACL types to give you a
taste for how rich Squid's ACL functionality is. Needless to say, however,
I can't cover usage scenarios for (or even adequately explain) all of
these. ViServe's &ldquo;Squid 2.6 Configuration Manual&rdquo; (see Resources) gives
complete syntax and usage examples for all.
</p><p>
Many, if not most, Squid installations don't go much beyond a few src ACLs,
along with perhaps a few simple dstdomain blacklist entries thrown in for
good measure. Many of the other most useful ACL types, such as myip, time,
port, proto, method, dst_mime_type and rep_mime_type, should be reasonably
self-explanatory (or at least easy enough to understand from the examples
shown in squid.conf's comments). 
</p><p>
One category of less-intuitive ACL types is particularly powerful and
useful: the ones that enable Squid to authenticate client users via
external authentication authorities. Before we tackle authentication,
however, we should give a little more attention to ACL operators, the tags
that perform some action (most commonly, to allow or deny a request) based
on a matched ACL.
</p><p>
By far, the most important ACL operator is http_access, which specifies
whether Squid should allow the transaction matching the specified ACL to
proceed. Going back to the example ACL/operator pair from the beginning of
this section, after we defined the ACL mick_network as all transactions
involving client/source IP addresses within 10.0.2.0/24, we operated on it
with this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http_access allow mick_network
</pre>
</p><p>
This is simple enough to understand: &ldquo;allow HTTP requests matching the ACL
named mick_network.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The most common use of ACLs is to specify a list of ACLs and http_access
statements, ending (as we've seen) with a &ldquo;drop by default&rdquo;
line, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http_access deny all
</pre>
</p><p>
This has the effect of creating a &ldquo;whitelist&rdquo;&mdash; a list of types of
transactions that are allowed, with all others being denied.
</p><p>
Squid recognizes a number of additional ACL operators besides http_allow,
including no_cache, ident_lookup_access, always_direct, never_direct and
snmp_access. Because most of these concern cache performance, HTTP redirects
and communications with other Squid servers rather than security per se,
I'll leave it to you to explore those (or not) as your particular needs
dictate. The Squid User's Guide referenced in the Resources section is a
good source of information about Squid's various ACL operators.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb41580.0xc33600"></a>
Squid Authentication</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned previously, one of Squid's most handy capabilities is its ability to
authenticate proxy users by means of a variety of external helper
mechanisms. One of the simplest and probably most commonly used helper
applications is ncsa_auth, a simple user name/password scheme that uses a
flat file consisting of rows of user name/password hash pairs. The HOWTO by
Vivek Gite and, to a lesser extent, the Squid User's Guide, 
explain how to set this up (see Resources).
</p><p>
Briefly, you'll add something like this to /etc/squid/squid.conf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squidpasswd
auth_param basic children 5
auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server at Wiremonkeys.org
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
auth_param basic casesensitive off
</pre>
</p><p>
And, in the ACL section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
acl ncsa_auth_users proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access allow ncsa_auth_users
</pre>
</p><p>
The block of auth_param tags specifies settings for a &ldquo;basic&rdquo;
authentication mechanism: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >program</tt> is the helper executable ncsa_auth, using the file
/etc/squid/squidpassd as the user name/password hash list (created
previously).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >children</tt>, the number of concurrent authentication
processes, is five.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >realm</tt>, part of the string that greets users, is
&ldquo;Squid proxy-caching Web
server at Wiremonkeys.org&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >credentialsttl</tt>, the time after authentication that a
successfully authenticated client may go before being re-authenticated, is
two hours.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >casesensitive</tt>, which determines whether user names are case-sensitive, is
off.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In the ACL section, we defined an ACL called ncsa_auth_users that says the
proxy_auth mechanism (as defined in the auth_param section) should be
used to authenticate specified users. Actually in this case, instead of a
list of user names to authenticate, we've got the wild card REQUIRED, which
expands to &ldquo;all valid users&rdquo;. The net effect of this ACL and its subsequent
http_access statement is that only successfully authenticated users may use
the proxy.
</p><p>
The main advantages of the NCSA mechanism are its simplicity and its
reasonable amount of security (only password hashes are transmitted, not
passwords proper). Its disadvantage is scalability, because it requires you
to maintain a dedicated user name/password list. Besides the administrative
overhead in this, it adds yet another user name/password pair your users are
expected to remember and protect, which is always an exercise with
diminishing returns (the greater the number of credentials users have,
the less likely they'll avoid risky behaviors like writing them down,
choosing easy-to-guess passwords and so forth).
</p><p>
Therefore, you're much better off using existing user credentials on an
external LDAP server (via the ldap_auth helper) on an NT Domain or Active
Directory server (via the msnt_auth helper) or the local Pluggable
Authentication Modules (PAM) facility (via the pam_auth helper). See
Resources for tutorials
on how to set up Squid with these three helpers.
</p><p>
Note that Squid's helper programs are located conventionally under
/usr/lib/squid. Checking this directory is a quick way to see which helpers
are installed on your system, although some Linux distributions may use a
different location.

Other Squid Defenses</h2></div></div><p>
Access Control Lists really are Squid's first line of defense&mdash;that is,
Squid's primary mechanism for protecting your network, your users and the
Squid server itself. There are a couple other things worth mentioning,
however.
</p><p>
First, there's the matter of system privileges. Squid must run as root, at
least while starting up, so that, among other things, it can bind to
privileged TCP ports such as 80 or 443 (although by default it uses the
nonprivileged port 3128). Like other mainstream server applications,
however, Squid's child processes&mdash;the ones with which the outside world actually
interacts&mdash;are run with lower privileges. This helps minimize the
damage a compromised or hijacked Squid process can do.
</p><p>
By default, Squid uses the user proxy and group proxy for nonprivileged
operations. If you want to change these values for effective UID and GID,
they're controlled by squid.conf's cache_effective_user and
cache_effective_group tags, respectively.
</p><p>
Squid usually keeps its parent process running as root, in case it needs
to perform some privileged action after startup. Also, by default, Squid
does not run in a chroot jail. To make Squid run chrooted, which also
will cause it to kill the privileged parent process after startup (that is, 
also will cause it to run <span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span> unprivileged after startup), you can
set squid.conf's chroot tag to the path of a previously created Squid
chroot jail.
</p><p>
If you're new to this concept, chrooting something (changing its root)
confines it to a subset of your filesystem, with the effect that if the
service is somehow hacked (for example, via some sort of buffer overflow),
the attacker's processes and activities will be confined to an unprivileged
&ldquo;padded cell&rdquo; environment. It's a useful hedge against losing the patch
rat race.
</p><p>
Chrooting and running with nonroot privileges go hand in hand. If a
process runs as root, it can trivially break out of the chroot jail.
Conversely, if a nonprivileged process nonetheless has access to other
(even nonprivileged) parts of your filesystem, it still may be abused in
unintended and unwanted ways.
</p><p>
Somewhat to my surprise, there doesn't seem to be any how-to for creating
a Squid chroot jail on the Internet. The world could really use one&mdash;maybe
I'll tackle this myself at some point. In the meantime, 
see Resources for some mailing-list posts that may help.
Suffice it to say for now that as with any other chroot jail, Squid's must
contain not only its own working directories, but also copies of system files
like /etc/nsswitch.conf and shared libraries it uses.
</p><p>
Common Squid practice is to forego the chroot experience and to settle for
running Squid partially unprivileged per its default settings. If,
however, you want to run a truly hardened Squid server, it's probably worth
the effort to figure out how to build and use a Squid chroot jail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb41580.0xf47b18"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Setting ACLs, running Squid with nonroot privileges most or all of the
time and running Squid in a chroot jail constitute the bulk of Squid's
built-in security features. But, these are not the only things you can do to
use Squid to enhance your network and end-user systems' security.
</p><p>
Next time, I'll show you how to use add-on tools such as SquidGuard to
increase Squid's intelligence in how it evaluates clients' requests and
servers' replies. I'll also address (if not next time then in a subsequent
column) some of the finer points of proxying TLS/SSL-encrypted sessions. 
Until then, be safe!
