Is it weird to say that DNS is my favorite protocol? Because DNS
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> my
favorite protocol. There's something about the simplicity of UDP packets
combined with the power of a service that the entire Internet relies on
that grabs my interest. Through the years, I've been impressed with just how
few resources you need to run a modest DNS infrastructure for an internal
network. 
</p><p>
Recently, as one of my environments started to grow, I noticed
that even though the DNS servers were keeping up with the load, the query
logs were full of queries for the same hosts over and over within seconds
of each other. You see, often a default Linux installation does not come
with any sort of local DNS caching. That means that every time a hostname
needs to be resolved to an IP, the external DNS server is hit no matter
what TTL you set for that record. 
</p><p>
This article explains how simple it is
to set up a lightweight local DNS cache that does nothing more than
forward
DNS requests to your normal resolvers and honor the TTL of the records it
gets back.
</p><p>
There are a number of different ways to implement DNS caching. In the past,
I've used systems like nscd that intercept DNS queries before they would go
to name servers in /etc/resolv.conf and see if they already are present in
the cache. Although it works, I always found nscd more difficult to
troubleshoot than DNS when something went wrong. What I really wanted was
just a local DNS server that honored TTL but would forward all requests to
my real name servers. That way, I would get the speed and load benefits of a local
cache, while also being able to troubleshoot any errors with standard DNS
tools.
</p><p>
The solution I found was dnsmasq. Normally I am not a big advocate for
dnsmasq, because it's often touted as an easy-to-configure full DNS and
DHCP server solution, and I prefer going with standalone services for that.
Dnsmasq often will be configured to read /etc/resolv.conf for a list of
upstream name servers to forward to and use /etc/hosts for zone
configuration. I wanted something completely different. I had full-featured
DNS servers already in place, and if I liked relying on /etc/hosts instead
of DNS for hostname resolution, I'd hop in my DeLorean and go back to the
early 1980s. Instead, the bulk of my dnsmasq configuration will be focused
on disabling a lot of the default features.
</p><p>
The first step is to install dnsmasq. This software is widely available for
most distributions, so just use your standard package manager to install the
dnsmasq package. In my case, I'm installing this on Debian, so there are a
few Debianisms to deal with that you might not have to consider if you use
a different distribution. First is the fact that there are some rather
important settings placed in /etc/default/dnsmasq. The file is fully
commented, so I won't paste it here. Instead, I list two variables I made
sure to set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ENABLED=1
IGNORE_RESOLVCONF=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
The first variable makes sure the service starts, and the second will tell
dnsmasq to ignore any input from the resolvconf service (if it's installed)
when determining what name servers to use. I will be specifying those
manually anyway.
</p><p>
The next step is to configure dnsmasq itself. The default configuration
file can be found at /etc/dnsmasq.conf, and you can edit it directly if you
want, but in my case, Debian automatically sets up an /etc/dnsmasq.d
directory and will load the configuration from any file you find in there.
As a heavy user of configuration management systems, I prefer the
servicename.d configuration model, as it makes it easy to push different
configurations for different uses. If your distribution doesn't set up this
directory for you, you can just edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf directly or look
into adding an option like this to dnsmasq.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, I created a new file called /etc/dnsmasq.d/dnscache.conf with
the following settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
no-hosts
no-resolv
listen-address=127.0.0.1
bind-interfaces
server=/dev.example.com/10.0.0.5
server=/10.in-addr.arpa/10.0.0.5
server=/dev.example.com/10.0.0.6
server=/10.in-addr.arpa/10.0.0.6
server=/dev.example.com/10.0.0.7
server=/10.in-addr.arpa/10.0.0.7
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's go over each setting. The first, no-hosts, tells dnsmasq to ignore
/etc/hosts and not use it as a source of DNS records. You want dnsmasq to
use your upstream name servers only. The no-resolv setting tells dnsmasq not
to use /etc/resolv.conf for the list of name servers to use. This is
important, as later on, you will add dnsmasq's own IP to the top of
/etc/resolv.conf, and you don't want it to end up in some loop. The next two
settings, listen-address and bind-interfaces ensure that dnsmasq binds
to and listens on only the localhost interface (127.0.0.1). You don't want to
risk outsiders using your service as an open DNS relay.
</p><p>
The server configuration lines are where you add the upstream name servers
you want dnsmasq to use. In my case, I added three different upstream name
servers in my preferred order. The syntax for this line is
<tt  >server=/domain_to_use/nameserver_ip</tt>. So in the above example, it would use
those name servers for dev.example.com resolution. In my case, I also wanted
dnsmasq to use those name servers for IP-to-name resolution (PTR records),
so since all the internal IPs are in the 10.x.x.x network, I added
10.in-addr.arpa as the domain.
</p><p>
Once this configuration file is in place, restart dnsmasq so the settings
take effect. Then you can use <tt  >dig</tt> pointed to localhost to test whether
dnsmasq works:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ dig ns1.dev.example.com @localhost

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.4-rpz2+rl005.12-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; ns1.dev.example.com @localhost
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4208
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;ns1.dev.example.com.                   IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ns1.dev.example.com.    265     IN      A       10.0.0.5

;; Query time: 0 msec
;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)
;; WHEN: Thu Sep 18 00:59:18 2014
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 56

</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I tested ns1.dev.example.com and saw that it correctly
resolved to 10.0.0.5. If you inspect the <tt  >dig</tt> output, you can see near the
bottom of the output that <tt  >SERVER:
127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)</tt> confirms that I
was indeed talking to 127.0.0.1 to get my answer. If you run this command
again shortly afterward, you should notice that the TTL setting in the
output (in the above example it was set to 265) will decrement. Dnsmasq is
caching the response, and once the TTL gets to 0, dnsmasq will query a
remote name server again.
</p><p>
After you have validated that dnsmasq functions, the final step is to edit
/etc/resolv.conf and make sure that you have nameserver 127.0.0.1 listed
above all other nameserver lines. Note that you can leave all of the
existing name servers in place. In fact, that provides a means of safety in
case dnsmasq ever were to crash. If you use DHCP to get an IP or otherwise
have these values set from a different file (such as is the case when
resolvconf is installed), you'll need to track down what files to modify
instead; otherwise, the next time you get a DHCP lease, it will overwrite
this with your new settings.
</p><p>
I deployed this simple change to around 100 servers in a particular
environment, and it was amazing to see the dramatic drop in DNS traffic,
load and log entries on my internal name servers. What's more, with this
in place, the environment is even more tolerant in the case there ever were a
real problem with downstream DNS servers&mdash;existing cached entries 
still would resolve for the host until TTL expired. So if you find your internal
name servers are getting hammered with traffic, an internal DNS cache is
something you definitely should consider.
