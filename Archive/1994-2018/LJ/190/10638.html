Don't settle for a desktop that came out of a box; find out
how to write your own Plasma widgets (aka plasmoids) and
give your desktop a shot in the arm or a kick in the you-know-what.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2ae2250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Plasma is one of the most exciting technologies KDE 4 has brought to
life. It often is considered to be merely the desktop shell of KDE 4, but
in reality, it is so much more.
</p><p>
We are just starting to see the full potential of Plasma, but it's already
being used by some of the best KDE applications. Amarok, for example,
uses it in so-called context view, and the Plasma packaging system is widely
used in conjunction with GetHotNewStuff technology. Plasma's main goal is
to provide a powerful framework you can use to build your own UIs.
All of this is possible because the Plasma libraries are not tied to
a specific use case. Instead of housing all the desktop-related code in
the plasma-desktop binary, the majority of it is contained in desktop-specific plugins.
That is why the desktop shell itself is just a few hundred lines of code, but it
uses thousands of lines of code located in the Plasma libraries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2ae2460"></a>
Why C++ and Not JavaScript?</h2></div></div><p>
Although JavaScript bindings are the official language for widget authoring,
for security reasons, its subset of functions is limited to the Plasma API,
and it gives the programmer no access to pure Qt or KDE components.
JavaScript plasmoids are great if you want your widget to be 
installable as an add-on easily and securely, in which case the bindings are
complete enough to give you access to most of the functions you will
ever need. JavaScript bindings also offer an extremely easy approach to
the API. There are less problems related to packaging,
and JavaScript is (usually) a less difficult language to use.
</p><p>
However, I'm going to introduce you to a C++ plasmoid,
because the JavaScript API is quite new, and most widgets to date have been
written in C++. For this reason, you're likely to find more code examples
or help for C++ plasmoids.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, we expect more and more JavaScript components to be produced
over time, especially after the release of KDE 4.4. And, as the API
remains very similar, it shouldn't be difficult to migrate your knowledge
of C++ to JavaScript.
</p><p>
Ruby, Python (including Edje support) and C# bindings are also
production-ready and offer access to the full C++ API, but if you use
them for your component, only users having the kdebindings package installed
will be able to use it. JavaScript bindings are the only ones shipped
with the Plasma libraries and are currently the only ones officially suggested.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2ae2670"></a>
Understanding Plasma's Design</h2></div></div><p>
We created Plasma with development flexibility in mind. The basic idea
is that to write simple things, you shouldn't need more than what is
necessary for actual functionality.
</p><p>
This approach should be very scalable and not limiting&mdash;meaning
you should be able to extend, tweak and experiment with user interaction
without destroying any work previously done or re-inventing the
wheel.
To achieve this, Plasma has separated the mechanisms of getting the data
from the visualization itself. This approach is commonly known as the
Model View approach.
</p><p>
In this tutorial, I create a plasmoid for providing a visualization
of an RSS source.
The C++ class that represents the base class for the visualization will be called Plasma::Applet.
I also briefly overview the other classes later in the article, and
I assume that you know some basic Qt programming techniques.
If that is not the case, however, check out some of the many tutorials
you can find on-line. I make references mainly to basic things
like QString or the Signal/Slot mechanism in this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2ae2880"></a>
Writing Your First Lines of Code</h2></div></div><p>
I'll get to the instructions to build the
plasmoid later; first, I want to give a brief
overview of the most significant parts of the code.
You can download the full source code from <a href="../listings/190/10638.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue190/10638.tgz</a>.
I don't cover the CMake configuration file in this article, but you can
find it in the tarball complete with comments.
</p><p>
All KDE plugins and extensions, as well as application launchers, are
described in the files with the .desktop extension. First, you need a
.desktop file for this tutorial. This file contains the data used
by KDE to show the applet to the user, and it contains the plasmoid's name,
description and credits. A minimal desktop file for this example plasmoid
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# plasma-applet-exampleplasmoid.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Name=RSS
Comment=An RSS Plasmoid
Icon=application-x-plasma
Type=Service
X-KDE-ServiceTypes=Plasma/Applet
X-KDE-Library=plasma_applet_plasmoid
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name=plasmoid
</pre>
</p><p>
The first lines are fairly obvious.
They provide a human-readable name and description and an icon.
The following lines tell the system what kind of plugin it is. The important line here is
the X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name. This line tells the KDE internals what
the plugin's name is (this is used as an argument to plasmoidviewer
to preview your plasmoid). Note that this name cannot contain any
special characters. Make sure the name of this file matches the pattern
plasma-applet-*.desktop.
</p><p>
Next, let's look at the source code for a very simple plasmoid,
with the minimum amount of code needed to make it valid,
such that it actually will compile and load.
</p><p>
First, the header:


<pre     class="programlisting">

// plasmoid.h
#ifndef PLASMOID_HEADER
#define PLASMOID_HEADER

#include &lt;Plasma/Applet&gt;

class Plasmoid: public Plasma::Applet
{
    Q_OBJECT
    public:
        Plasmoid(QObject *parent, const QVariantList &amp;args);
        ~Plasmoid();
};

// This is the command that links your applet to the .desktop file
K_EXPORT_PLASMA_APPLET(plasmoid, Plasmoid)

#endif

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this is a pretty simple class derived from Plasma::Applet.
A few interesting things to note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The first two lines (and the last one) are the common trick for ensuring that
the header file doesn't get loaded multiple times&mdash;meaning you will have no compiler
errors due to that.
</p></li><li><p>
The Q_OBJECT macro is inserted because you need to make use of slots
later on (the signal/slot paradigm is a Qt feature, and any introduction
to Qt should explain it if you're not familiar with it).
</p></li><li><p>
The K_EXPORT_PLASMA_APPLET macro is what actually exports
the plasmoid (and, therefore, makes it displayable). You can
find more information on this macro on TechBase (see Resources).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now, here's the actual implementation:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#include "plasmoid.h"

Plasmoid::Plasmoid(QObject *parent, const QVariantList &amp;args)
    : Plasma::Applet(parent, args)
{
}

Plasmoid::~Plasmoid()
{
}

#include "plasmoid.moc"

</pre>
</p><p>
For now, this plasmoid doesn't do anything beyond
displaying its own background. If you were to compile it and
preview your work with plasmoidviewer, you would see what looks like
Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10638f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. First Run of the Applet
</p></div></div><p>
It's a bit boring perhaps, but on the other hand, it compiles and runs.
Now, let's inject some cool features.
</p><p>
To get some new data, you should be familiar with another Plasma component, the DataEngine.
This class is the base class that the applet uses to
interact with the rest of the world. It mainly is used to fetch data
from different sources. DataEngine is a read-only object. Its read/write
counterpart is the Service class, which is used in cases where user
input can modify the environment outside the plasmoid itself (think of
Web services, for example). Just like Applets, additional DataEngines
and Services can be written and installed by the user.
It's simple to connect to a data engine from within an applet;
you just need to add the following line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Plasma::Applet::dataEngine("rss")-&gt;
           connectSource("http://dot.kde.org/rss.xml", this);
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, <tt  >rss</tt> is the name of the data engine you want to
invoke. The first argument of connectSource() is the source name
(in this case, the URL of the feed you want), and the second argument
is the object that should be updated when the data engine receives new data.
Another data engine example would be the Time data engine, and
you would connect it with the following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
timeEngine-&gt;connectSource("Local", this);
</pre>
</p><p>
Local, in this case, means the local time zone. This, however, will update
only once. To make it update itself automatically (and update
your plasmoid) every second, you would have to write something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
timeEngine-&gt;connectSource("Local", this, 1000);
</pre>
</p><p>
The third parameter, if present, specifies how often (in milliseconds)
you should request an update from the source. Note that the source also can
decide to update itself independently.
</p><p>
You also can connect several data engines to one single object; just
make sure to check the sourceName in the dataUpdated function (see below)
when the update occurs.
</p><p>
You can get a list of the available engines and their structure with a
plasma tool called PlasmaEngineExplorer. Run the following
command inside your terminal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plasmaengineexplorer
</pre>
</p><p>
This will show you a rather large list of engines from which to choose for building
your plasmoid. Find one that inspires you and start hacking on it.
To know what structure the data engine
gives you, you either can use the engine explorer, look at another
applet's source code, or even explore the data engine source code itself.
</p><p>
To give your plasmoid the data, the DataEngine tries to
call a slot with the following signature:


<pre     class="programlisting">

void dataUpdated(const QString &amp;sourceName,
                 const Plasma::DataEngine::Data &amp;data)

</pre>
</p><p>
Add this function (method) to your Plasmoid class with
the following code (don't forget the declaration in the header file):


<pre     class="programlisting">

void Plasmoid::dataUpdated(const QString &amp;sourceName,
                           const Plasma::DataEngine::Data &amp;data)
{
    QMap&lt;QString, QVariant&gt;
             item      = data["items"].toList().first().toMap();
    QString  title     = item["title"].toString();
    QString  feedtitle = item["feed_title"].toString();
}

</pre>
</p><p>
DataEngine is type-agnostic; it stores all of its data in
QVariants. It's your responsibility to know what data to expect
and to convert it accordingly.
In this case, the data is a QList of QVariants (each item)
that in reality is a map. You take the first element and convert it
to a QMap. Then, you extract the title and the feed title and store them in
QStrings. That is all you need to get the data from any RSS feed.
</p><p>
So now, you've got the data, but how do you display it? With Plasma, it's a
piece
of cake!
</p><p>
The Plasma team has created several useful widgets that can be utilized in an
applet. What you need in this case is a label. First, create a simple
linear layout for the plasmoid in the constructor, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
QGraphicsLinearLayout *layout = new QGraphicsLinearLayout(this);
setLayout(layout);
</pre>
</p><p>
A QGraphicsLayout will resize and align all the widgets
it contains automatically. Linear and Grid layouts also are available.
Now, include a Plasma::Label as a member in the header, initialize it
and add it to the layout, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
m_rssTitle = new Plasma::Label(this);
layout-&gt;addItem(m_rssTitle);
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, add the following lines to dataUpdated():


<pre     class="programlisting">

QString text = "Most recent news from &lt;b&gt;"+feedtitle+"&lt;/b&gt;:";
text += "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"+title;
    m_rssTitle-&gt;setText(text);

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you don't need to destroy/free any objects, because every object that has
a parent (assigned on creation by passing an argument to the constructor)
is deleted automatically by Qt's garbage-collection system.
</p><p>
If you compile your applet now, and everything has gone well, you should
see something like Figure 2 when launching the plasmoidviewer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10638f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Plasmoid Widget in Its Full Glory
</p></div></div><p>
When the DataEngine fetches new data, your plasmoid will 
be updated automatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2ada818"></a>
Build Environment</h2></div></div><p>
For your build to succeed, you must have the Qt4 and KDE development
libraries, cmake and the usual compilation tools, such as make, g++ and so
on, installed onto your system. Note that this tutorial
assumes a KDE version greater than or equal to 4.3.
</p><p>
To build your plasmoid, change directory to your plasmoid, and issue the
following commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the backticks (``) in the cmake command, which mean
&ldquo;substitute here the result of the evaluation of the quoted
command&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The first time you test the plasmoid, you'll have
to refresh the KDE configuration cache by issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll also need to run this command any time you make modifications to
the plasmoid desktop file.
</p><p>
To test the plasmoid, run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plasmoidviewer plasmoid
</pre>
</p><p>
Plasmoidviewer is a little test application that makes it easy to load and
play with a single plasmoid without having to restart your desktop every
time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2adad40"></a>
Writing Other Types of Plasmoids</h2></div></div><p>
In this tutorial, I've explained how to write a simple plasmoid from
scratch, but I've barely scratched the surface.
As I mentioned previously, Plasma is all about plugins,
and writing other types of plasmoids is just as easy. You can, for example,
write your own &ldquo;containment&rdquo;.
Containments are a subset of applets, which are built to contain other
applets. The panel, the desktop, or the &ldquo;folder view&rdquo; are all examples of
containments. Being applets, they also can be used like regular applets
wherever that makes sense.
</p><p>
You can write wallpapers, which are plugins that draw a
containment's background. With these, you can draw a simple image or
a more complex rendering, such as a Mandelbrot fractal or even an animated
(and intractable) Earth globe!
</p><p>
You also can create a plasma theme, which changes the look and feel of
all the applets through the usage of SVGs.
</p><p>
Apart from visualization, you can write a DataEngine and/or an associated
Service to be able to gather information from the rest of the world. You
can make a Runner, which is a plugin that responds to user
queries&mdash;from &ldquo;3+2&rdquo; to &ldquo;run command x&rdquo; to
&ldquo;google for x&rdquo; to &ldquo;shut down the PC&rdquo;.
These are then accessible from Krunner, from menus, or even from your own applet!
</p><p>
All of this also is accessible through scripted languages, be it
JavaScript, Ruby, Python or many others. And obviously, you can invent
your own binding to Plasma by re-implementing a ScriptEngine, which has
been done, for example, to be able to load simple Apple Dashboard or
Edje widgets.
</p><p>
As you can see, there are almost infinite possibilities for expressing your
creativity, and all this goodness is exposed through an intuitive
and powerful API.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ea580.0x2adb210"></a>
A Quick Look into the Future</h2></div></div><p>
This article was written in October 2009, when the stable version of
KDE was 4.3, and Qt was at version 4.5. By the time you read this, however,
both Qt 4.6 and KDE 4.4 should be available, so let's briefly outline
what possibilities these new versions will offer:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
First, Qt introduces a new animation framework, sometimes referred to
as Qt Kinetic, which makes animations in our plasmoids trivial. You will be
able to decide what should be animated, how that element should look
at the start of the animation (for example, be at position 0,0) and how it
should look at the end
of it (for example, be at position 100,20, rotated 20 degrees and scaled by a
factor 2), and everything will be taken care of for you. For more
information,
take a look at the Qt documentation (see Resources).
</p></li><li><p>
Anchor layouts, a minor improvement in Qt that might nonetheless save
you from major headaches, are designed to make it possible to achieve many visual
presentations with less effort.
</p></li><li><p>
Remote plasmoids is one of the most interesting things that KDE
4.4 will bring. This technology has been developed as a Google Summer
of Code Project, and it allows you to transport applets,
data engines and services over the network transparently. Without any more code
than what you would write for a local component, you will be able
(because of compression and caching algorithms)
to distribute services and content between any HTTP-capable
machine efficiently. Ideas include writing a lightweight server application that
distributes plasmoids and/or content directly from a Web server, without
requiring any graphical interface on it or perhaps built directly into your
Web 2.0 application. The API to interact with this technology is, in fact,
extremely simple and has a very small runtime requirement.
