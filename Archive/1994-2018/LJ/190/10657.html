Displaying remote applications on a local system or even controlling a
remote desktop requires little configuration and almost no changes to your
everyday application use.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc92a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the advantages to using a GNU/Linux system is the separation of the
display system from the underlying operating system. The Linux desktop has
at its core the X Window System, a software architecture that provides
layering of display components. Each component provides its own set of
display features. These features include the ability to change out window
managers, directly drive hardware, provide alternative desktop environments
and even remotely display some or all of a desktop.
</p><p>
Most Linux users will be familiar with window manager and video display
hardware tools, because the desktop paradigm has long assumed the user is
sitting in front of the system running the desktop applications. Remote
display, although not new to the X Window System, is discussed less often,
because end users were thought to have only one system in use. But,
end-user needs have grown more sophisticated, and applications like media and
Web servers, for example, provide ample reasons to manage multiple
PCs remotely, even within a single household.
</p><p>
In this article, I discuss the variety of methods available to Linux
users for running Linux applications on a remote system for display
locally. I cover basic configuration issues, discuss limitations and
advantages, consider security implications and contrast the reasons for
using each method. All of the tools discussed in this article should be
available from any popular Linux distribution, although package names may
vary. Examples and discussion focus on GNOME-based solutions running
on Fedora, although similar functionality and applications exist for KDE
users. This article does not specifically address display of Mac or
Windows applications on Linux systems; however, the section on VNC is closely
applicable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc9510"></a>
The GNU/Linux Display Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
From a very high level, the GNU/Linux display system can be viewed as three
distinct components (Figure 1). At the lowest level comes the Linux kernel and the X.org
display server and its associated libraries (referred to commonly and
collectively as X11). The display server and kernel work together to
provide management of the display hardware, and the libraries provide
higher-level software a convenient means of using them.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10657f1.large.jpg"><img src="10657f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Linux Display System Stack
</p></div></div><p>
The desktop environment sits in the middle of this stack. This includes
GNOME, KDE and Xfce, the three most popular desktop environments. In
support of these environments are application libraries, such as GTK+ and
Qt, as well as a variety of other general-purpose libraries used by desktop
applications.
</p><p>
Applications sit above the desktop environment. These are the actual
tools users run to view movies, listen to music, communicate with friends
and coworkers and purchase products from the Internet.
</p><p>
Remote display of applications is handled by features found within the
Infrastructure and Desktop layers. Applications that run in the desktop
and X11 environments can be told to display remotely but leave the
details of how that is done to the underlying layers of the stack.
</p><p>
There are three methods by which users can run an application on a remote
system and have it display locally&mdash;that is, on the screen in front of which
they are seated. The first method involves the use of the X Display
Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP). This protocol is part of the X11
specification and is implemented on Linux systems using the GNOME Desktop
Manager (GDM) or when using KDE, by the KDE Display Manager (KDM), both of
which are replacements for the X Display Manager (XDM).
This method is focused on running individual applications,
although there are applications that can provide a complete remote desktop.
</p><p>
The second method relies on OpenSSH support of X11 protocols. It also is 
focused on running individual applications and is typically easier to
configure and use.
</p><p>
The last method is based on Virtual Network Computing (VNC) mechanisms that are
operating-system-independent and more suited to complete desktop sharing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc99e0"></a>
Using XDMCP via GDM</h2></div></div><p>
In X11 parlance, the server is the thing that manages your display
hardware,
and the client is the application that needs the server to display windows.
This often confuses people, because it's backward from one's normal understanding
of the terms client and server, as now the server is the computer in front of you
and the client is the remote computer.
</p><p>
Most applications on the Linux desktop provide the -display command-line
option. This option is equivalent to setting the DISPLAY environment
variable, 
and it tells X11 clients (applications) which X server to display on. The default setting
is to display on the local server, referenced as :0.0. A remote server can be
specified by prefixing this value with the hostname (or IP address), such as galileo:0.0.
The reference to galileo:0.0 works only if the host galileo is running at
least one instance of an X server.
</p><p>
The use of the -display option is tied to the configuration of XDMCP on the
X server. XDMCP is the old-school method of displaying remote applications
on a local display. Most old-time UNIX and X11 users are familiar with its
use, although configuration issues have evolved with the Linux desktop.
</p><p>
On GNOME systems, XDMCP is controlled by GDM.
GNOME users are familiar with GDM from the graphical login screen. That
screen is actually only one part of GDM and not related to our discussion.
GDM also controls XDMCP usage for an X session, otherwise known as a
graphical login. The graphical login starts a new X server with various
options. By default, GDM does not permit XDMCP connections to the X server
from remote client applications. To enable it, edit the file /etc/gdm/custom.conf
to look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# GDM configuration storage
[xdmcp]
Enable=true
[chooser]
[security]
DisallowTCP=false
[debug]
</pre>
</p><p>
The [xdmcp] section has a single option, Enable, which when set to true,
allows XDMCP connections. However, GDM also needs to be told to allow TCP
connections in order for the remote applications actually to use XDMCP when
communicating with the X server. The [security] section option
DisallowTCP must be set to false in order to disable the feature that
denies TCP connections.
</p><p>
Note that XDMCP is the higher-level protocol (the way a client application
and an X server will communicate), while TCP is a lower-level protocol, which
for our purposes can be defined as the networking port that the
communication flows through.
</p><p>
Once configured, restart GDM. You can do so by changing the run state
to 3 and then back to 5 with the following commands, with a short pause
between them recommended. Be aware that if you execute the first command
in a terminal/shell window, the window will disappear, because this command kills the X server.
You'll be dropped into a virtual console/terminal, at which point, you 
probably will have to log in to execute the second command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo init 3
sudo init 5
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the local X server is configured to allow remote applications to
connect to it. One additional step is required to specify which hosts have
access to the local X server. There are two ways to do this. One is
to edit the /etc/hosts.allow and/or /etc/hosts.deny files. A simpler
method is to run the xhosts command after logging in to the local system:

<pre     class="programlisting">

xhost +&lt;hostname-or-ip&gt;
xhost -&lt;hostname-or-ip&gt;
xhost +

</pre>
</p><p>
The first command allows a specific host to display locally, and the
second denies a host. The third method allows any host to display locally.
This option should be used only on a trusted network, such as your network
at home that is behind your firewall. The xhost settings are applicable
only to
the current login session.
</p><p>
Now, open a terminal window, log in to the remote system (preferably with
SSH, but Telnet if you must),
and start another terminal with the display option set to the local X
server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xterm -display galileo:0.0
</pre>
</p><p>
The xterm started here is running on the remote system but displaying on
the local X server (on the computer in front of you). You can start other applications the same way with
each appearing as an ordinary window on the local desktop. In this way, the
remote applications mix seamlessly with the local desktop.
If for some reason your shell prompt doesn't include the name of the host
in the prompt, you probably should set it so that you know on which system
each xterm is running.
</p><p>
GDM comes with GNOME, so as long as you have GNOME installed, you can use
this method of remote application display.
With KDE, you normally would use KDM, but its configuration is not
covered here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bca010"></a>
Remote Desktops Using Xnest/Xephyr</h2></div></div><p>
The -display option allows a single application to display remotely, but
what about an entire desktop? It is possible to start a graphical login
remotely over XDMCP using the Xnest or Xephyr X servers. These servers
act like application windows on your local display but connect to the
remote display manager (GDM) to offer up a graphical login. GNOME doesn't
include these servers, and on most Linux distributions, they are likely not
installed by default. However, if you do a quick search of your distribution's
software repositories, you should find packages similar to these Fedora-specific
packages: xorg-x11-server-Xephyr and xorg-x11-server-Xnest.
</p><p>
After installation, the servers can be run manually to connect to a remote
system:


<pre     class="programlisting">

Xnest :10 -query &lt;host-with-gdm-configured&gt; -geometry 1024x768
Xephyr -query &lt;host-with-gdm-configured&gt; -screen 1024x768 :1

</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10657f2.large.jpg"><img src="10657f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Xephyr-Based Remote Desktop Running Evolution
</p></div></div><p>
Experiments with both shows that Xephyr (Figure 2), the more modern and more actively
developed of the two, was more stable. Unfortunately, logging out of a
session prevented further connections. That may be because GDM was
configured to allow only a single session from a remote system and may be
fixed with additional research into GDM configuration. In these tests,
however, the only solution was to restart GDM on the remote host.
</p><p>
XDMCP via GDM acts as a conduit for remote applications to display on a local
machine. This means it does not control remote desktops. In fact, there
doesn't need to be anyone logged in to the remote system at all, although GDM
does need to be running. Because it doesn't take control of an existing X
session remotely, it is possible to have a different display size on the
local display. For example, if the remote system provides only a display
resolution of 800x600, it still would be possible to display at 1024x768 on the
local display using a Xephyr and a GDM/XDMCP-managed connection. It also
means you can use different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, Xfce or
others) for the remote and locally displayed sessions.

Remote Display via SSH</h2></div></div><p>
By far, the easiest of the three methods for remote application display is
to use SSH. SSH is the secure shell, a tool for connecting to remote
systems using encrypted communications. Linux systems use the open-source
OpenSSH implementation of SSH. This package offers X11Forwarding, a
configurable option in the server and client (the SSH server and client)
that end users utilize with the -X command-line option.
</p><p>
SSH uses a client/server architecture. The server side is the remote
system, and the client is the local system
(the configuration that we normally think of as client/server and the opposite of X).
The remote server must be configured to allow X11 forwarding. This is done by enabling the
X11Forwarding option in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
AcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE
AcceptEnv LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES
AcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE
AcceptEnv LC_MEASUREMENT LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL LANGUAGE

#AllowAgentForwarding yes
#AllowTcpForwarding yes
#GatewayPorts no
X11Forwarding yes
...
</pre>
</p><p>
X11 forwarding also can be enabled on a per-user basis in this file by
placing the X11Forwarding option after a user specification:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
Match User bilbobaggins
   X11Forwarding no
...
</pre>
</p><p>
These changes will not take affect until the SSH server is restarted. If
your distribution provides it, the service command is the easiest way to do
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service sshd restart
</pre>
</p><p>
The client-side configuration, found in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, requires
enabling the Forward11Trusted option. This is enabled by default on Fedora
systems, although other distributions may require the option to be enabled
manually:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
ForwardX11Trusted yes
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the location of the SSH client and server configuration files may
vary with different Linux distributions. Consult the OpenSSH package for
your distribution to find the configuration files.
</p><p>
Once the server and client sides are configured for SSH, a user can use
X11Forwarding by adding the -X option to an SSH login. The -X option
passes the required DISPLAY information to remote applications, which
automatically open on the local display. Note that using SSH
X11Forwarding means the remote application should not use the -display
option nor should the DISPLAY environment variable be set. SSH will take
care of all of that automatically.
</p><p>
SSH X11Forwarding does not require the remote machine to be running GDM or
an X server. This means remote systems can be run in headless mode,
which means they have no display at all. Instead, users log in remotely
using <tt  >ssh -X</tt>, run graphical applications on the remote system and have them
display locally. This places far less load on the remote system than using
the GDM-based remote application display.
</p><p>
Although in most instances, you will need to have an X server installed
on the remote system, because most X applications, which are on the remote system,
will need the associated X libraries, and most package managers will end up
installing the entire X server to provide them:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ssh -X &lt;remote host&gt;
# login to remote host succeeds...
xterm -geometry 80x50

</pre>

</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc27e8"></a>
Virtual Network Computing (VNC)</h2></div></div><p>
XDMCP is the old-school method, and SSH is the safe method. But, the method
best integrated into the desktop is Virtual Network Computing (VNC). VNC
is a system based on the Remote Frame Buffer protocol from Olivetti
Research Labs, which is available for anyone to implement. This protocol
isn't based on X11, but lives at a lower level in the Infrastructure layer.
This means VNC software can work with any desktop system, including Linux,
Windows and Mac OS/X. With VNC, you can display remote Linux desktops next
to remote Mac desktops on your local display.
</p><p>
VNC is essentially a protocol definition&mdash;it describes how something
should work. There are numerous implementations available
for Linux systems. Clients are referred to as viewer applications. One
open-source implementation is TigerVNC, a fork of the popular TightVNC
implementation. TigerVNC offers both server and client viewers and was
created to help increase development activity on the project.
</p><p>
GNOME users will find Vino as the default VNC server and Vinagre as the
most full-featured client viewer, and they are tightly integrated with the
desktop,
meaning GNOME provides menu options to configure and enable both the
client (Vinagre) and server (Vino).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc29a0"></a>
VNC Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike XDMCP/GDM and SSH, VNC is not used to launch remote applications for
display on the local system. Instead, it is used to view and/or grab
control of the remote desktop. Thus, the remote desktop must already
be running. Additionally, VNC would not be useful if the remote system
were
running in headless mode, although Xvnc can remove this restriction also.
Xvnc provides a remote &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; X server to which VNC clients
can connect.
Because the remote desktop is virtual, Xvnc also can be used to enable
an alternate remote desktop and/or multiple remote desktops, perhaps of different sizes.
</p><p>
The VNC server must be enabled on the remote system for the client viewer
to connect to it. The server is configured from GNOME using the
System&rarr;Preferences&rarr;Remote Desktop menu option. The configuration dialog
requires enabling desktop sharing, configuring security
constraints and setting methods of notification (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10657f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Vino Configuration under GNOME
</p></div></div><p>
Sharing refers to how the desktop will be accessed. Sharing is
enabled by allowing remote users to view the desktop and, if desired,
allowing them to take control of the desktop. In the latter case, the
user of the desktop where the server is enabled will no longer be able to
use the desktop while the remote user controls it. For administration of
systems on your local network at home, the server should be configured to
allow other users to control the desktop.
</p><p>
Under Security, the only option required for home use is specifying a
password. This password is not encrypted for Vino or TigerVNC, so this
protection is not very helpful outside of a local network protected by a
firewall. If the option to confirm each connection is set, every time
you use a VNC client viewer to connect to that machine, you also must walk
over to that machine to allow the connection. For home use, this option
should not be set.
</p><p>
Notifications are a personal preference. Because the idea of VNC, at least for our purposes here,
is that the server is on a machine you don't want to be in front of, the notifications
are of little use. However, it is helpful to have an icon displayed when a
connection is active, in case you forget when one machine is controlling
the one you're trying to use.
</p><p>
On the client side, the GNOME Vinagre VNC client viewer is started from
Applications&rarr;Internet&rarr;Remote Desktop Viewer. The Vinagre client looks
like any other desktop application (Figure 4), with a menu bar and an obvious Quit
option (File&rarr;Quit). This is in contrast to, for example, Xephyr for
displaying a remote desktop. Vinagre also allows opening connections to
multiple remote servers with each remote desktop connection accessed by a
tabbed folder (Figure 5). This makes using VNC very convenient and easy to
understand,
as it uses the usual desktop application widget paradigms.

VNC: Multihead Using Two Computers</h2></div></div><p>
One of the clever ways to use VNC is to connect the local keyboard
and mouse to the remote desktop. This simulates a multihead configuration
where two monitors act as a single screen. Using x2vnc, the local computer
acts like the first monitor, and the remote desktop acts like the second
monitor. Moving the mouse off the right edge of the local monitor moves it
into the left edge of the remote desktop. This is a clever way of using a
laptop to control a MythTV client connected to your TV without having to
deal with IR remote controls or IR keyboard/mouse combinations. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

x2vnc &lt;remote host&gt; -east (or -west, -north, -south)

</pre>
</p><p>
Above, the -east option configures the remote desktop to act as if were to the
right of the local desktop, and -west reverses this setup. Various other
options are available to refine the use of this configuration.
</p><p>
VNC extensions provide various forms of compression and security. These
extensions must be supported on both ends of the communication. If the
server supports these but the client does not, VNC still will function
between the two but without those extensions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad1580.0x1bc3448"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>VNC Pros and Cons</b></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>

Performance</h2></div></div><p>
From a bandwidth perspective, the use of SSH is likely to provide the best
performance of these three options, as long as only a single remote
application is displayed locally. GDM-based connections are likely to be
roughly similar in performance, depending on the compression available in the
SSH connection and what, if any, compression may be configured in GDM.
</p><p>
VNC has the potential to be the fastest of all three if extensions are
introduced that compress the frame buffer data sufficiently. Because VNC
is based on a tile architecture, where rectangles of frame buffer memory
are resent if they have been updated, any compression that improves the
transfer of tiles will have serious performance implications. However, at
the time of this writing, there were no such extensions currently in use.

Security</h2></div></div><p>
XDMCP uses UDP port 177, and the X server uses TCP port ranges from 6000 +
display number. XDMCP also is prone to DoS attacks. GDM has some
configuration options to address this, but XDMCP use still should be
considered insecure. Therefore, GDM and XDMCP should be limited to use
behind firewalls and should not be used across the Internet.
</p><p>
SSH connections are, by design, secure if properly used. Because of
built-in encryption, there is no reason SSH X11Forwarding could not be used
across the Internet. Note that the use of X11 protocols over SSH can be
bandwidth-intensive, and therefore, only a small number of applications from
the remote system should be displayed locally using SSH.
</p><p>
VNC can be used across the Internet as long as the remote server's firewall
forwards port 5900 to that server. VNC does not include security
extensions by default and, therefore, is insecure in nature. Various
server implementations provide security extensions, but Vino does not.
VNC use across the Internet using Vino as the server should be
done only over VPN or SSH connections.

Choosing a Method</h2></div></div><p>
None of these options support playing media files, such as movies or music.
I mentioned that media servers could be managed remotely, and I stand by
that. The management of those systems&mdash;starting and stopping servers,
configuring them and so forth&mdash;is easily done using any of these methods.
But, making use of those media provided by those servers is best left to
streaming media players that connect from the local system to the remote
servers.
</p><p>
For home users who need to manage remote systems on their local network
that sit behind a well configured firewall, VNC offers the most complete
and easy-to-use option. Home office users who need to connect to remote
systems may find SSH a better option (as this author does). GDM/XDMCP
is the least-favored solution, because SSH is faster and arguably easier to
use for single applications, and VNC offers easier-to-use solutions for
accessing remote desktops. Still, GDM/XDMCP is the only option if
your needs include starting a new session on a remote system, as neither
SSH nor VNC supports that type of use.
