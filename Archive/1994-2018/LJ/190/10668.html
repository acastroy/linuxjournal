<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #190, February 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>quilt</b></span> tools were developed by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> for the same reason&mdash;to help organize patches. But part of
Andrew's motivation in developing quilt was to avoid having to adapt
his work habits to git. So, what do you get if you cross those two
tools together? Apparently, you get <span   class="bold"><b>StGit</b></span> (stacked git), a Python
script developed by <span   class="bold"><b>Catalin Marinas</b></span> and various others. It emulates
quilt's ability to push and pop patches onto and off of a stack, but
it does so on top of a full git repository. Thus, users can take
advantage of the full range of git features, in addition to the
pushing and popping features of quilt.
</p><p>
Large numbers of occurrences of the <span   class="bold"><b>big kernel
lock</b></span> (BKL) are being
expunged from the kernel. This isn't exactly news, but the pace of BKL
patches seems to have stepped up lately. The basic pattern seems to be
to push the BKL out of the core code and into specific drivers. This
way, only a single piece of code relies on a given occurrence of the
BKL. This lets the developers replace just that occurrence with
something that does a different kind of locking that works for just
that bit of code. The whole problem with eradicating the BKL is that
the true locking requirements of anything that uses it are really very
different from each other. So, if a lot of stuff depends on a single
instance of the BKL, it's just impossible to recode that instance of
the BKL to be less heavy-handed and still work for everyone. That's
one reason why various folks used to say getting rid of the BKL would
be nearly impossible. But lately, thanks to this whole process, folks
like <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Jan Blunk</b></span> and others are ripping the BKL out
of the kernel in big fistfuls.
</p><p>
On systems with tons of CPUs, just listing the <span   class="bold"><b>boot
messages</b></span> on the
screen can cause big delays in the boot process and produce so much
output, any information that actually might be useful for
debugging is simply buried under tons of other data. <span   class="bold"><b>Mike Travis</b></span>
calculated that with 4,096 processors and a console baud rate of 56K,
the boot messages would take almost an hour and a half just to
display. He's posted some patches and worked with various folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span> to help reduce the number of less-relevant
messages that come through during startup.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Relicensing kernel code</b></span> is tricky. You need to get permission from
everyone who's submitted patches, because those people hold
the copyright on their own contributions and have (modulo some legal
fuzziness) released their code under the same license as the rest of
the code, or under the licensing that they specify when they submit
the patch. So, when <span   class="bold"><b>Mathieu Desnoyers</b></span>
wanted to dual-license portions
of the <span   class="bold"><b>tracepoint</b></span> code under the <span   class="bold"><b>GPL</b></span> and the <span   class="bold"><b>LPGL</b></span>, and other portions
under the GPL and <span   class="bold"><b>BSD licenses</b></span>, he had to ask all the contributors for
permission.
</p><p>
In the old days, that would be a nonstarter, because identifying all
contributors would involve combing through mailing-list logs and
Usenet logs, and even then, there wouldn't be any guarantee that
everyone had been found. With the advent revision control for the
kernel and the <span   class="bold"><b>Signed-Off-By</b></span> headers that are now standard with all
patch submissions, it's now trivial to list everyone who's contributed
to a piece of the kernel, as far back as the revision control records
go.
</p><p>
Even so, actually getting everyone's permission is not always a done
deal. In this case, Ingo Molnar rejected Mathieu's request, putting
Mathieu in the position of either having to abandon the project,
persuade Ingo to change his mind or extract Ingo's code and relicense
the remainder, which would be very difficult. It's unclear how this
particular case will turn out, but it's at least possible the
relicensing will take place.

<h2 class="title">Comparing Files</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #190, February 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You often may need to compare one version of a file to an
earlier one or check one file against a reference
file. Linux provides several tools for doing this, depending on how
deep a comparison you need to make.
</p><p>
The most common task involves comparing two text files. The tool of
choice for this task is diff. With diff, you can compare two files
line by line. By default, diff notices any differences between the
two text files, no matter how small. This could be as simple as a
space character being changed into a tab character from one file to
the next. The file will look the same to a user, but diff will find
that difference. The real power of diff comes from the options
available to ignore certain kinds of differences between files. In the
above example, you could ignore that change from a space character to
a tab character by using the <tt  >-b</tt> or
<tt  >--ignore-space-change</tt> options, which tell diff to ignore any
differences in the amount of whitespace from one file to the next. 
</p><p>
What about blank lines? The <tt  >-B</tt> or
<tt  >--ignore-blank-lines</tt> options
tell diff to ignore any changes in the number of blank lines from
one file to the next. In this way, diff effectively looks 
only at the actual characters when comparing the files, narrowing diff's focus to the
actual content.
</p><p>
What if that's not good enough for your situation? You may need to
compare files where one was entered with Caps Lock turned on for some
reason, or maybe the terminal being used was misconfigured.
You may not want diff to report simple differences in case as
&ldquo;real&rdquo;
differences. In this situation, use the <tt  >-i</tt> or
<tt  >--ignore-case</tt> options.
</p><p>
What if you're working with files from a Windows box?
Everyone who works on both Linux and Windows has run into the issue
with line endings on text files. Linux expects only a single newline
character, while Windows uses a carriage return and a newline
character. diff can ignore this with the 
<tt  >--strip-trailing-cr</tt> option.
</p><p>
diff's output can take a few different formats. The default
contains the line that is different, along with a number of
lines right before and after the line in question. These extra
lines are called context and can be set with the &ldquo;-c&rdquo;,
&ldquo;-C&rdquo; or
&ldquo;--context=&rdquo; options and the number of lines to use for context. This default
output can be used by the patch program to change one file into the
other. In this way, you can create source code patches to upgrade code
from one version to the next. diff also can output differences
between files that can be used by ed as a script with the 
<tt  >-e</tt> or <tt  >--ed</tt> options. diff also
will output an RCS-format diff with the
option <tt  >-n</tt> or <tt  >--rcs</tt>. Another option is to print out the
differences in two columns, side by side, with the
<tt  >-y</tt> or
<tt  >--side-by-side</tt> options. 
</p><p>
The diff utility compares only two files. What if you need to compare
three files?
diff3 comes to the rescue. This utility compares three
files and prints out the diff statements. Again, you can use the
<tt  >-e</tt>
option to print out a script suitable for the ed editor.
</p><p>
What if you simply want to see two files and how they differ?
Another utility might be just what you are looking for, comm. With no
other options, comm takes two files and prints out three columns. The
first column contains lines unique to the first file, the second
column contains lines unique to the second file, and the third column
contains lines common to both files. You can suppress each
of these columns selectively with the options <tt  >-1</tt>,
<tt  >-2</tt> and <tt  >-3</tt>. They suppress
columns 1, 2 or 3, respectively.
</p><p>
Although this works great for text files, what if you need to compare two
binary files? You need some way to compare each and every byte in each
file. Use the cmp utility, which does a 
byte-by-byte comparison of two files. The default output is a printout of
which byte and line contains the difference. If you want
to see what the byte values are, use the <tt  >-b</tt> option.
The <tt  >-l</tt> option gives even more detail, printing out the byte
count and the byte value from the two files.
</p><p>
With these utilities, you can start to get a better handle on how
your files are changing. Here's hoping you keep control of your files!

<h2 class="title">Linux in Education</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #190, February 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the biggest arguments used against Linux in grade-school-level
education is that we aren't teaching kids to use the applications they'll
need in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;. As the Technology Director for a
K&ndash;12 school
district, I've heard that argument many times. After all these years,
I still don't buy it. Truthfully, to give kids a well-rounded
education, we should expose them to as many different types of technology
as we can. Children should be comfortable using whatever tool is at
their disposal to accomplish a given task. This isn't a new concept
by any stretch of the imagination. For some reason, when it comes to
computers, however, the &ldquo;Microsoft Mantra&rdquo; is all too prevalent.
</p><p>
Think about some other subject areas:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Language: teachers begin teaching grammar to young kids. They start
with the simple concepts, like differentiating between nouns and verbs,
and move on to tougher things. By the time students are finished in
high school, they've likely been given many different types of writing
assignments. The concepts they've learned allow them to write well as
they continue in life. Guess what though? I never once was taught to blog
in school. It just didn't exist. Thankfully, because I was taught the
concepts of writing and grammar, I'm able to pull off the crazy world
of blogging as if I were specifically trained for it.
</p></li><li><p>
Mathematics: just like with language, mathematics are taught with
fundamentals. Specific problems are assigned (remember
story problems?), but it's very clear that everything we learned in
school was meant to be extrapolated upon.
</p></li><li><p>
Reading: I didn't go to the most prestigious school in the country. Heck,
I didn't even go to the best school in the area. I am very certain,
however, that no school assigns every book ever written to their
students. Even if they did, more books are published every day. Again,
it's the <span   class="emphasis"><em>concept</em></span> of reading that we learn, not specific books.
</p></li><li><p>
Driver's Ed: my first car was a 1978 Volkswagen Diesel Rabbit. It was
a four-speed manual transmission, and it had the touchiest clutch I've ever
driven. In driver's ed, however, I drove a cute little Dodge with an
automatic. Sure, when I finally got a car, I had to learn a few new things,
but my driver's education and driver's license prepared me perfectly
fine. The rules, procedures and, yes, concepts were all the same.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So why are computers different?
</p><p>
I think there are a few valid arguments for specific applications being
taught in schools. For vocational programs, especially if they are
computer-related, a firm grasp of the specific applications that will be
used is slightly advantageous. Even with that, however, it's important
to teach concepts, because programs change all the time.
</p><p>
Higher-level education (college and so on) is certainly the time to begin
specializing in specific areas. Some of those areas require certain
applications and/or operating systems. Accountants, for example, might
be expected to know how to use QuickBooks. Graphic designers probably would be
expected to know Adobe Photoshop inside and out.
</p><p>
At the grade-school level though, we need to teach children not only
how to use technology, but also how to learn to use technology. If we can
offer students the use of Windows, Linux and Macintosh, and teach them
Web 2.0, handheld computing and application concepts, we prepare
them to succeed. Isn't that what we ultimately want for kids? For them
to succeed in whatever they do?
</p><p>
Linux is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span> tool for education. It plays well with other
operating systems, and it offers such a wide variety of applications that
it's silly not to expose children to its usage. Oh, and there's also
that little thing called cost. For many schools, that alone can seal the
deal. Linux offers more, costs less and even can fit well with existing
tools. Why in the world wouldn't schools want Linux?

WinSCP is an open-source SFTP, FTP and SCP client for Windows.
It provides two GUI interfaces: an Explorer-style interface and
a Commander-style interface. You remember Norton Commander, right?
In addition, it provides a command-line interface with scripting
capability.
</p><p>
WinSCP provides all the expected file operations:
uploading, downloading, renaming, deleting, creating directories and so on.
It also has the ability to synchronize local and remote directories.
You can edit remote files using a local editor.
It even gives you the ability to find files on the remote system.
The GUI interfaces provide Windows integration: drag and drop,
desktop and quick launch icons, &ldquo;Send To&rdquo; support and so on.
</p><p>
WinSCP optionally allows you to store configuration information
in a configuration file rather than in the registry for making
your WinSCP configuration portable.
WinSCP also provides U3 support, which is a proprietary method for
formatting USB drives and auto-launching applications from them.
</p><p>
WinSCP has been translated into numerous languages.
The current stable release is 4.1.9, but version 4.2 may be
available by the time you read this (at the time of this writing, the
fourth beta version of 4.2 is available).

Even with modern Linux distributions, the inconsistency with onboard
audio devices makes using headphones and microphones a hit-or-miss venture.
When things work, they work great, but when things don't work, it's
generally tough to get them going.
</p><p>
Thankfully, there is an audio standard that seems to work pretty
consistently across operating systems: USB. Although the thought of
purchasing additional hardware to get sound into or out of your Linux
machine might seem a bit frustrating, USB audio devices tend to have
better sound quality than the cheap onboard audio devices that come with
most laptops and desktops.
</p><p>
Now, because I've given you this tip, you'll probably never need to use it.
Still, it's good to know USB audio is very supported under Linux, and
the devices are fairly standard. Plus, it's easy to add multiple audio
devices with USB audio, which makes things like podcasting much easier!

<h2 class="title">Wave Goodbye to E-mail?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #190, February 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Late last year, getting a Google Wave invite was reminiscent of getting
a Cabbage Patch Kid in 1983. It was the newest gizmo everyone just
had to have. As a geek, I was one of the kids begging the loudest.
Thankfully, one of our readers from across the pond (Paul Howard,
thanks!) sent me an invite, and I cleared my schedule for the product
that was going to change the way I communicate. Only, it didn't.

</p><p>
I'll admit, some of the reasons are not Google's fault. First,
off, it wasn't even in beta yet. I also didn't really have anything I
wanted to communicate with anyone. Even with those two things in mind,
I did expect it to be fun to experiment with. Quite frankly, it seemed more
cumbersome than helpful.
</p><p>
In watching the demonstrations on the Google Web site, it seems apparent
Google Wave was designed to solve some problems we've all faced in e-mail.
Where I think Google may have gone wrong, however, is in trying to solve
a problem with additional technology that really we've all learned to
manage anyway. Sure, Google Wave allows conversations to take place in one
section,
so everyone can see what's going on, but we've all solved that years ago
with &ldquo;reply all&rdquo; and &ldquo;forward&rdquo;. Yes, Wave allows for embedded photos,
videos and so on, but let's be honest, we've all been attaching files and/or
links for years.

</p></div></div><p>
So what do you think? Am I off-base with my assessment? Is Google Wave
changing the way you communicate? If so, I'd love to hear about it.
You'll have to send me an e-mail though, because even though I got my Google
version of the Cabbage Patch Kid, mine is still in the box.
