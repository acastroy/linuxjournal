article, <i  >LJ</i> Technical Editor Don Marti
explains how you too can be the first on your block to build a
machine that develops over 9,000 BogoMips. But now that machines
with processor speeds of 1-2GHz, and even multiple processors, and
gigabytes of RAM are quite common, building the Ultimate Linux Box
isn't only about sticking the fastest and the biggest together
(although that's still a lot of fun). Therefore, in addition to
making recommendations on cards, motherboards, hard drives, etc.,
Don takes a look at some of the finer points of box building, such
as box real estate, the advantages of building over buying and
cooling. Though it's certainly a labor of love, Don has been
working with vendors and others for many months now in order bring
you building advice that has real value, whether you're building a
computer from top-of-the-line components or one that represents a
more modest budget.
</p><p>Speaking of modest budgets, in Cooking with Linux this month,
Marcel takes an alternative view of the idea of the Ultimate Linux
Box, showing how you can obtain greater speed from humble resources
by lightening the software load. He samples some lightweight
software that includes a window manager with abundant features, a
web browser and office software that manage to run all together in
less than 32MB of memory.</p><p>Last month we ran an update to Charles Curley's November 2000
article on bare metal recovery. This month, Joey Hess shows how to
avoid conscious backups all together by keeping not only your
projects, but your entire home directory, in CVS. Joey admits the
idea is a sure sign of an unbalanced mind, but that it also has
many advantages, not the least of which is distributed
backups.</p><p>Also in this issue, we have a report from John &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall on his recent visit to the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
to attend the F&oacute;rum Internacional de Software Livre. Jon
discovered that in Brazil they are taking the concept of world
domination quite seriously, and the state of Rio Grande do Sul has
had laws favoring the use of open-source software by government and
business for some time now. His article points out a number of
highly worthy free software projects.</p></div></div>
