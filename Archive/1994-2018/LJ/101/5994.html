    A look at the possibilities of Pd and GEM for Linux-based
    audio and video.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1145580.0x123d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>As a multimedia-capable platform Linux
has seen terrific growth over the past few years. At the system
level, a simple kernel patch can now improve scheduler efficiency
and bring performance latencies down to an incredible three
milliseconds or less, well within the acceptable range for
professional audio and video applications. Given the low-latency
patch (along with some other fine-tuning), we can now consider the
availability of applications capable of utilizing this enhancement.
</p><p>Along with performance artist Chris Spradlin, I am currently
working on a multimedia presentation that combines video
playback/processing, still-image and video projection, and various
forms of audio capture, playback and transformation. Controlling
the interplay of the different media poses a considerable
challenge, particularly because we want to do everything in real
time and in Linux. Happily, I have found an excellent solution to
our dilemma: Miller Puckette's remarkable Pd.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1145580.0x123d768"></a>From the Simple</h2></div></div><p>Pd (pure data) is an audio synthesis/processing environment
similar to the famous Max (and its Java offspring jMax). These
environments employ a neat scheme of graphically patching various
simple components (such as signal generators/modifiers and their
control objects) into complex sonic networks.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5994f1.large.jpg"><img src="5994f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. A Simple Pd Patch</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 1 demonstrates Pd's basic principles: the osc~ signal
generator creates an audio waveform (a cosine wave), the slider
controls the frequency (pitch) of the waveform and the network
around the dbtorms object modifies the amplitude (volume) of the
generated signal. Finally, the modified signal is sent to the dac~
object (the digital-to-analog converter) and the results are heard
through the audio system.</p><p>Pd includes a variety of ready-made objects for signal
generation and processing, and if this kind of synthesis patching
were all Pd could do, it would still be an impressive audio
environment. However, thanks to Mark Danks' wonderful GEM
OpenGL-based graphics library, Pd also can manipulate video and
image parameters in real time. Pd's flexibility permits arbitrary
connection and control between its audio and video streams,
creating a powerful environment for controlling and coordinating
multimedia presentations.</p><p>In order to use Pd with GEM, you must invoke it via the
$HOME/.pdrc file or with a command string similar to this
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pd -rt -lib /home/dlphilp/gem-0.87_2/Gem
</pre><p>The -rt option prioritizes Pd's performance to real-time
status. When coupled with a low-latency kernel, Pd's performance is
quite acceptable for live shows and other real-time circumstances.
You'll want all the help you can get when you're running Pd with
the GEM library; the kernel latency patch is a godsend, but you'll
still need a hardware-accelerated OpenGL installation to make the
best use of GEM.
</p><p>Note: the test system for this article included an 800MHz
Duron CPU, 256MB RAM and a Voodoo3 AGP video card. The Linux kernel
version was 2.4.5, patched for low latency; the video subsystem was
XFree86 4.0.1. Certain operations in GEM are very CPU-intensive,
and I would qualify the Voodoo3 as the low end of acceptable video
boards for the Pd/GEM alliance. The audio system included a Sound
Blaster Live! sound card running under the ALSA 0.9.0beta10 driver.
Note also that Pd version 0.34-4 (stable) was used along with
IOhannes Zmoelnig's beta version of GEM 0.87. Previous incarnations
of GEM do not include the Linux versions of the pix_movie and
pix_film objects needed for the real-time video manipulations
described here.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5994f2.large.jpg"><img src="5994f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A Simple Pd/GEM Patch</p></div></div>
</p><p>In Figure 2 we see the basic structure of a simple Pd patch
utilizing the GEM library functions. Note that the gemwin and
gemhead objects are required for all other GEM-related actions.
This patch provides the mechanisms for loading a movie (anim-3.mov
in this case) and playing it back while rendering it to the
surfaces of a cube. The cube size is controlled by the slider
movement, and the film can be started and stopped by clicking on
the smaller Bang button (one of the two cyan-colored boxes).
Figures 3-5 demonstrate this patch in action. The first snapshot
(Figure 3) illustrates the simplest rendering, with one face of the
cube displayed and expanded to fit most of the rendering window.
Figure 4 shows how the rotate object manipulates the cube, and
Figure 5 displays the curious effect that occurs when the slider
value exceeds the rendering window size. Of course the still images
can't convey the effect of the movie playing upon the surfaces of
the animated cube, but trust me, it's very cool.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5994f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

example patches. Using straightforward cut/copy/paste editing, we
easily can copy one patch's contents into another and start having
some serious fun. Pd truly lives up to the promise of its name:
data is purely data here, any data stream can be routed anywhere
within a patch (with some restrictions), and we easily can set up a
system in which one set of controllers simultaneously controls
audio and video parameters.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5994f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. A Complex Pd/GEM Patch</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 6 illustrates our complex combined audio/video patch.
As you can see, the two sliders each simultaneously control an
aspect of the video along with an aspect of the audio. Adjusting
the audio amplitude results in an adjustment of the cube size,
while moving the slider for the audio frequency control also will
rotate the cube on its x/y axes. Multimedia artists will find great
possibilities in Pd's support for such arbitrary attachments and
correspondences. I also should note that GEM includes numerous
other fascinating pixel-based effects (such as color convolution
and pixel threshold control), but I leave their exploration to the
interested reader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1145580.0x123e790"></a>Project Assessment</h2></div></div><p>Basing our work upon the examples shown here, we are
currently planning our presentation for a two-man show. We hope to
use no more than two Linux-powered laptops (ideally we would need
only one) and a variety of external devices (video recorder/player,
still-image projector, lighting displays, etc.). Ease of
transportation is a concern because we would like to be able to
take the show on the road in a single vehicle.</p><p>Our Pd audio explorations have been quite stable in
performance, which is good news because we plan to use Pd's
real-time audio processing throughout the piece. GEM 0.87_2
sometimes crashes Pd, but I'm using a beta version as I write this
article. IOhannes Zmoelnig is dedicated to GEM's improvement, so we
reasonably can expect flawless performance by the time we are ready
to mount our first performance (targeted for late 2002). We also
have seen that combining heavy audio and video processing creates a
need for more powerful hardware than we currently employ. I hope to
improve our video situation with the addition of a GeForce3 video
card. Finally, we also intend to use Pd's shoutcast~/oggcast~
objects for broadcasting our performances live over the
Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1145580.0x123e8f0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Pd is incredibly easy to work with, permitting fast
construction of relatively complicated patches. The examples shown
here were designed merely as learning tools and proof-of-concept
demonstrations, and I have already created considerably more
complex patches for our project. This article is only a shallow
indicator of the possibilities of Pd and GEM, and I encourage all
Linux-based audio and video artists to get involved with this
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1145580.0x123e9f8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Vast thanks to Miller Puckette and Mark Danks for creating
and freely distributing Pd and GEM. Thanks also to the Pd community
for their continuing assistance to this perpetual newbie, and
especially to IOhannes Zmoelnig of IEM for his beta version of GEM
0.87 and for his unstinting aid while I learn more about GEM's
video objects. Finally, great thanks also must go to Guenter Geiger
for his initial work on the pix_movie object and for his many other
contributions to the Linux versions of Pd and GEM.</p><p><a href="5994s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
