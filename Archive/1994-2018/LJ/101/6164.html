    Using AOLserver is not nearly as difficult or challenging as
    you initially might expect.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x14034a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Apache, the well-known HTTP server, is
something of a poster child for open-source software: it is
popular, stable, flexible, secure, portable, extensible and
compliant with internet standards. I've been using Apache since it
was first released, and it's a joy to work with.
</p><p>But given that there are multiple open-source operating
systems, editors, databases and programming languages, it shouldn't
come as a surprise to hear that Apache isn't the only open-source
HTTP server. What is surprising is that one of the alternatives
comes from America Online, the same company that sponsors Mozilla,
the open-source web browser.</p><p>AOLserver offers many of the same features as Apache: it is
released under an open-source license, is easy and flexible to
configure and offers an API for writing plugin modules. But
AOLserver has a fundamentally different architecture from Apache,
which often makes it a more efficient choice. Moreover, AOLserver
includes a built-in Tcl interpreter, multiple threads, database API
and database connection pooling. If your web site uses a lot of
database connections, then it's worth looking into AOLserver as an
alternative to Apache.</p><p>This month, we look at AOLserver as a lead-in to several
articles about the open-source OpenACS (Open Architecture Community
System) web application framework. While AOLserver is not an
absolute requirement for OpenACS, it is the standard and expected
way to configure and install the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x14036b8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>AOLserver began as NaviServer, written and sold by a
pioneering company called NaviSoft that offered high-quality,
client- and server-side tools for web publishers. AOL has often
bought companies that have developed interesting technology; in the
case of NaviSoft, AOL bought them for their server- rather than for
their client-side tools.</p><p>AOLserver probably would have remained relatively unknown
were it not for a combination of events: AOL made binary copies of
the program available at no cost via the Internet, and Philip
Greenspun began work on the ArsDigita Community System. AOLserver
makes it easy to create high-performance, database-backed web
sites; the fact that ACS made heavy use of relational databases
meant that AOLserver was a perfect fit.</p><p>But while AOLserver was free of charge, the source code still
was unavailable to the general public. In 1999, Greenspun helped
negotiate a deal that resulted in the release of AOLserver 3.0
under the AOLserver Public License, which is essentially identical
to the Mozilla Public License.</p><p>ArsDigita itself effectively went out of business earlier
this year, with its remaining staff and assets becoming part of Red
Hat Software. But the original ACS software lives on in the OpenACS
Project, which is based on the original Tcl version of ACS, using
AOLserver and either PostgreSQL or Oracle.</p><p>AOLserver's transition to an open-source model wasn't without
its problems. While the details are still a bit sketchy, a number
of OpenACS developers briefly worked on their own fork of
AOLserver, which they called OpenNSD, arguing that the AOLserver
developers needed to be more open to community involvement. OpenNSD
now appears to be dead, with the OpenACS community once again
encouraging people to use AOLserver.</p><p>At the same time, ArsDigita added a number of enhancements to
AOLserver that have not yet been added to the server's source code
in its latest stable or development editions. Because my use of
AOLserver is almost always connected to OpenACS, I will be using
AOLserver 3.3ad13, available at
<a href="http://www.openacs.org/software.adp" target="_self">www.openacs.org/software.adp</a>.
More advanced versions, including a development snapshot for the
upcoming 4.0 version, are available at
<a href="http://www.aolserver.com" target="_self">www.aolserver.com</a>.
But right now, these official versions are not guaranteed to
support OpenACS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x1403a28"></a>What Makes It So Great?</h2></div></div><p>Until earlier this year, when version 2.0 was first released
to the general public, Apache was a multiprocess server. That is, a
number of Apache processes would run at any given time, with each
process able to handle a single HTTP transaction at a given time.
Supporting ten simultaneous transactions meant having ten Apache
processes running in parallel, while supporting 100 simultaneous
connections meant having 100 such connections available.</p><p>Apache 2.0 changes this somewhat, allowing you to have
multiple threads per process. Each thread can handle an HTTP
connection, meaning that five threads in each of five processes can
accept up to 25 simultaneous connections. Because threads typically
consume fewer resources than processes, this effectively means that
a typical PC will benefit from an increase in performance.</p><p>AOLserver, by contrast, has always been multithreaded and
operates within a single process. At any given time, your computer
will be running only one copy of nsd, whose name reflects the fact
that it was once the NaviServer d&aelig;mon. But that one process
can handle a large number of simultaneous HTTP connections. Indeed,
AOL continues to push AOLserver development precisely because it
can handle such a large number of simultaneous connections. It uses
AOLserver on its own high-traffic web sites, including
<a href="http://netscape.com" target="_self">netscape.com</a>,
<a href="http://aol.com" target="_self">aol.com</a> and
<a href="http://digitalcity.com" target="_self">digitalcity.com</a>.</p><p>One advantage&mdash;and potential pitfall&mdash;of a multithreaded
solution is the fact that the threads easily can share data
structures with one another. AOLserver takes advantage of this to
create a pool of database connections. Because connections in this
pool are always kept open, your web applications will not have to
spend time opening (or closing) them. Moreover, because it is rare
for all of a server's current HTTP connections to require
simultaneous access to a database, the pool can contain fewer
connections than the maximum number of threads&mdash;reducing the amount
of memory used by the web server and the database server. You can
think of this as the database equivalent of packet switching, in
which a telephone line is shared among numerous parties by taking
advantage of the fact that no one needs the line 100% of the
time.</p><p>AOLserver supports plugin modules, much as Apache does. There
are a number of modules available, ranging from an XML parser
(nsxml) to an embedded version of Python (PyWx). There are also
modules for executing CGI programs, for secure connections via SSL
and for individual relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL
and Oracle. Because OpenACS can work with either PostgreSQL or
Oracle, the version of AOLserver available for download from
<a href="http://openacs.org" target="_self">openacs.org</a> includes both
of these modules, as well as nsxml.</p><p>Just as mod_perl allows web developers to customize Apache's
configuration and responses without using C, AOLserver provides an
integrated API that allows you to create custom functionality in
the Tcl language. Truth be told, I personally would prefer to use
Perl or Python for development, but as many AOLserver and OpenACS
developers have told me over the years, Tcl &ldquo;isn't that bad&rdquo;, and
I have managed to create a number of interesting, maintainable
applications using Tcl and AOLserver in a remarkably short period
of time. (I haven't yet tried the embedded Python module, in part
because OpenACS requires the use of Tcl.) And, the API that
AOLserver provides makes it relatively easy to work with such
things as HTTP headers and HTML form values.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x1403e48"></a>Compiling and Configuring</h2></div></div><p>Compiling AOLserver is relatively straightforward. Unlike
Apache, which provides support via the apxs program for compiling
modules after you have installed the server, AOLserver requires
that all modules be compiled and installed together.</p><p>While creating this user and group is not mandatory,
AOLserver will refuse to run as root for security reasons. So
before you begin to compile and install AOLserver, you should
create a new user and group on your system, traditionally called
nsadmin. On my Red Hat 7.2 system, I simply say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/adduser nsadmin
</pre><p>While still logged in as root, I now create the
/usr/local/aolserver directory, into which AOLserver is installed
by default. I then give ownership of this directory to nsadmin:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /usr/local/aolserver
chown nsadmin.nsadmin /usr/local/aolserver
</pre>


Once we've done this, I change to the nsadmin user, open the source
code that I downloaded from
<a href="http://openacs.org" target="_self">openacs.org</a> and begin the
compilation process:
<pre     class="programlisting">
su - nsadmin
cd /tmp
tar -zxvf aolserver3.3ad13-oacs1-beta-src.tar.gz
cd aolserver
./conf
</pre>


This will automatically configure, compile and install AOLserver
according to your system's parameters, placing files under the
directory /usr/local/aolserver. AOLserver automatically will try to
compile whichever modules it can, ignoring (and excluding) any
others. On my desktop machine, which has development libraries for
PostgreSQL but not for Oracle, configuring and installing AOLserver
in this way results in the inclusion of the PostgreSQL driver, but
ignores the Oracle driver entirely.
</p><p>The build process can take awhile and doesn't produce a great
deal of output to the screen. If you are concerned that the process
has somehow become frozen, you can look at the log/aolserver.log
file; all of the compilation output can be found there.</p><p>When the build process is done, you will have a copy of
AOLserver in /usr/local/aolserver. The most important directories
under /usr/local/aolserver are bin, in which the AOLserver (nsd)
program is located, along with the shared libraries (.so) for each
of the modules that were compiled into the server. The log
directory contains access and error logs for the server, and the
lib directory contains the built-in Tcl interpreter.</p><p>AOLserver's configuration file is written in Tcl; a simple
configuration file is placed by default in
/usr/local/aolserver/sample-config.tcl. If you examine it, you will
see that each of the configuration directives is actually a Tcl
variable assignment. These variable assignments are divided into
sections, where each section normally represents a module that was
compiled into the server.</p><p>As you can see from the sample configuration file, you can
assign literal values to variables. For example, you can set the
HTTP port to which AOLserver listens to 8000 with the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set httpport 8000
</pre><p>Because the configuration file is written in Tcl, you also
can set the homedir variable, which is /usr/local/aolserver by
default, by asking AOLserver rather than hard-coding the value:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set homedir          [file dirname [ns_info config]]
</pre>


And of course, you can base variable settings on the values of
other variables, using simple interpolation:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set servername             "server1"
set pageroot ${homedir}/servers/${servername}/pages
</pre>


Those two lines, from the sample configuration file that comes with
AOLserver, configure the root of static URLs to be in
/usr/local/aolserver/servers/server1/pages.
</p><p>Other configuration settings are made with the ns_param
command, which typically takes two parameters: a name and a value.
Each parameter must come in a section, begun by a call to
ns_section. For example, we can activate server debugging by
turning on the debug parameter in the (global) ns/parameters
section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ns_section "ns/parameters"
ns_param   debug           false
</pre><p>Unfortunately, the documentation for AOLserver's parameters
is quite lacking when compared with the on-line Apache
documentation. An almost complete list of parameters is at
<a href="http://aolserver.com/docs/admin/config-reference.tcl.txt" target="_self">aolserver.com/docs/admin/config-reference.tcl.txt</a>,
which demonstrates a server configuration that sets nearly
everything.
</p><p>Once you have finished configuring your system&mdash;and the
default configuration is a good start for simple sites&mdash;you can
start AOLserver by invoking the nsd program and specifying the name
of the configuration file you want to use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/aolserver
bin/nsd -f -t sample-config.tcl
</pre><p>The -f option runs AOLserver in the foreground, sending the
error log to your screen. Once you feel comfortable with what's
happening, you can remove the -f, looking in the log directory for
your server's error log.
</p><p>If you want AOLserver to listen to port 80, then you must
start it as root. Otherwise, Linux will refuse to honor the
request, telling you that only the superuser can start servers that
listen to &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; ports (i.e., less than 1024). If only root
can listen to port 80, but AOLserver refuses to run as root, how
can you serve port 80? By starting AOLserver as root and passing it
options to indicate the user and group to which it should
switch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su root
cd /usr/local/aolserver
bin/nsd -f -u nsadmin -g nsadmin -t \
  sample-config.tcl
</pre><p>You should now be able to point your browser at
http://yourhost.yourdomain.com:8000/ and see the introductory
AOLserver document, welcoming you to this new server. Note that
AOLserver's configuration file looks for both your computer's name
and its IP address, so if you are connected to a network, you will
not be able to point your browser to localhost, but will instead
need to use its full name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x1404790"></a>Tcl Programs</h2></div></div><p>While AOLserver is undoubtedly an excellent HTTP server for
static documents, you're unlikely to use it for that. It's far more
common to create dynamic pages using Tcl.</p><p>The easiest and simplest way is to create a Tcl program that
returns HTML. To do this, create a file in the pageroot that ends
in the .tcl extension. It can create any Tcl that you want; the
most important thing, however, is that it end with ns_return&mdash;a Tcl
procedure defined by AOLserver that takes three arguments: 1) a
numeric HTTP response code (such as 200 or 404) that indicates the
success or failure of the program's execution, 2) a
&ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header that describes the type of content that is
being returned and 3) the actual content to return to the
user.</p><p>For example, here is a simple &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;
program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ns_return 200 text/html "&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;"
</pre><p>If you stick the above program in the pageroot directory as
hello.tcl and load it into your browser, you will get the literal
contents of the file returned to you. That's because we need to
reconfigure AOLserver to allow .tcl pages within the pageroot. We
do this by setting the enabletclpages parameter to true within the
ns/server/${servername} section:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ns_section "ns/server/${servername}"
ns_param   enabletclpages  true
</pre>


Once you have made this change, you can restart AOLserver and
retrieve hello.tcl once again. This time, you should see HTML
output rather than the verbatim, text/plain output.
</p><p>A .tcl page can do a host of different things: connecting to
a database, retrieving information from XML files to retrieving
information from across networks or receiving information from an
HTML form. Because Tcl comes with a variety of string-manipulation
commands, you can parse the input and interpolate variables into
the output in a wide variety of ways.</p><p>Note that the Tcl is interpreted within AOLserver, rather
than as an external process. This means that such .tcl files
execute much faster than a CGI program would; in many ways, they
run similarly to Perl programs in mod_perl.</p><p>It's true that .tcl files are great when a programmer is
creating the outgoing HTML. But as I (and others) have learned from
bitter experience, graphic designers generally are unprepared to
modify HTML that appears within source code files. For this reason,
many web developers have switched over to templates&mdash;be they ASP,
JSP, HTML::Mason, DTML or a variety of other similar technologies.
AOLserver comes with its own built-in templating system, known as
ADP (AOLserver Dynamic Pages), whose syntax is suspiciously similar
to Microsoft's ASP. Code that you want to execute goes within &lt;%
and %&gt;, while the code that outputs a value into the surrounding
HTML goes within &lt;%= and %&gt;. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;% set foobar "abcdef" %&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;%= $foobar %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>Sites larger than a few pages probably will want to share
some Tcl code. The easiest way to do this is to create one or more
.tcl files that define procedures that AOLserver will load at
startup time. These procedures then will be available to all of
your .tcl and .adp pages. To enable this functionality, we must add
the following to our sample-config.tcl file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ns_section ns/server/${servername}/tcl
ns_param   library \
  ${homedir}/servers/${servername}/tcl
ns_param   autoclose      on
ns_param   debug          true
</pre>


Since our server name is server1, any .tcl file that we place in
/usr/local/aolserver/servers/server1/tcl will be loaded when
AOLserver starts up. For example, I added the file foo.tcl to that
directory, whose contents consisted of:
<pre     class="programlisting">
proc return_hello {} {
    return "hello"
}
</pre>


I restarted AOLserver (which is necessary in order for it to read
Tcl library files) and modified hello.adp to read:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;% set foobar "abcdef" %&gt;
&lt;% set hello [return_hello] %&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;%= $foobar %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;%= $hello %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>


Now the value of the &ldquo;hello&rdquo; variable is set to the output from
my return_hello proc, which in this case is nothing more than the
word hello.
</p><p>Because you must restart AOLserver in order for it to load
library Tcl procedures, I've often found it easiest to define new
procedures within &lt;% %&gt; sections in my ADP pages. Once I see
that the procedure works correctly, I move its definition to the
library directory and restart AOLserver only once.</p><p>ADP and .tcl pages are fine for documents that contain some
dynamic content. But sometimes you want to associate programs with
a URL without necessarily creating a document on disk. We easily
can take care of this by defining a Tcl procedure in our library
file and then registering that procedure with a particular URL
using the AOLserver ns_register_proc command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc http_hello {} {
  ns_return 200 text/html "&lt;html&gt;
                           &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello!
                             &lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
                           &lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!
                             &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
                           &lt;/html&gt;"
}
ns_register_proc GET /hello http_hello
</pre><p>If you put this Tcl code in a file that sits within the
library directory we defined earlier, restart your server and point
your browser to /hello, you will see the output from our http_hello
procedure.
</p><p>I've been programming in mod_perl for several years and am
still impressed by the ease with which you can create new dynamic
pages with AOLserver and ns_register_proc. Moreover, you can
register different procedures for GET and POST requests. You even
can register filter procedures that can monitor or change the
output generated by another page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130b580.0x17fd118"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If you plan to use OpenACS for on-line communities, then you
almost certainly will have to learn how to work with AOLserver. But
even if OpenACS does not interest you, AOLserver's flexibility,
speed and multithread capabilities are well worth investigating for
your dynamic web sites.</p><p><a href="6164s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
