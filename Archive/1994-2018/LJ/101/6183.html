    Greg explains how to use patch and diff or BitKeeper for
    kernel development.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11be558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many issues involved with Linux kernel
development are different from traditional software development
processes. When working on a portion of the kernel (or a specific
driver), you need to 1) stay aware of changes that are happening to
other portions of the kernel with which you interact, 2) constantly
apply your changes to the moving target of a fast-based kernel
development release schedule, 3) resolve any merge conflicts
between changes you have made and changes made by other people and
4) be able to export your changes in a format others can use
easily.
</p><p>For a number of years, I developed and maintained the USB to
serial port drivers and then eventually took over maintaining all
of the USB code in the kernel. In this article, I explain some of
the tools I used in the past to do this work and show how some new
tools have enhanced my ability to keep on top of changes in the
kernel and let me do my job with less effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11be6b8"></a>patch and diff</h2></div></div><p>One of the most common methods of doing kernel work is to use
the patch and diff programs. You can use this and no other type of
source-code control system to do kernel development. One way is to
use two different directory trees: a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; one and a
&ldquo;working&rdquo; one. The clean tree is a released kernel version, while
the working one is based on the same released kernel version, but
contains your modifications. Then you can use patch and diff to
extract your changes and forward port these changes to a new kernel
release. For example, let's start off with a clean 2.4.18 kernel
(available at
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.18.tar.gz" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.18.tar.gz</a>)
in our working directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls
linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
</pre><p>Uncompress this kernel, and then rename the created
directory, which will be called &ldquo;linux&rdquo; to something that makes
sense:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -zxf linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
$ mv linux linux-2.4.18
$ ls
linux-2.4.18  linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
</pre>


Now create a duplicate version of this kernel version, and name it
something else:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -zxf linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
$ mv linux linux-2.4.18-greg
$ ls
linux-2.4.18  linux-2.4.18-greg  linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
</pre>


Now we can do all of our development in our -greg directory and
leave the clean, original kernel directory alone. After we are
finished with our work, we need to create a patch to send to other
people. The Documentation/SubmittingPatches file explains the
proper format that most kernel developers like for sending and
receiving patches. It also explains the usage of a dontdiff file,
which can help with generating these patches. The dontdiff file can
be found at
<a href="http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/dontdiff" target="_self">www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/dontdiff</a>
and contains a list of files that you do not want to have the diff
program pay attention to.
</p><p>To create a patch, use the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ diff -Naur -X dontdiff \
linux-2.4.18 linux-2.4.18-greg/ &gt; my_patch
</pre><p>This creates a file called my_patch that contains the
difference between your work and a clean 2.4.18 kernel tree. This
patch then can be sent to other people via e-mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11bead8"></a>New Kernel Versions</h2></div></div><p>If a new kernel version is released, and you want to forward
port your changes to the new version, you need to try to apply your
generated patch onto a clean kernel version. This can be done in
the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Generate your original patch, as in the previous
example.</p></li><li><p>Using the official patch from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>, move the old
kernel version forward one release:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd linux-2.4.18
$ patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-2.4.19
$ cd ..
$ mv linux-2.4.18 linux-2.4.19
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Move your working directory forward one release by
removing your patch, then applying the new update:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd linux-2.4.18-greg
$ patch -p1 -R &lt; ../my_patch
$ patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-2.4.19
$ cd ..
$ mv linux-2.4.18-greg linux-2.4.19-greg
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Try to apply your patch on top of the new
update:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd linux-2.4.19-greg
$ patch -p1 &lt; ../my_patch

</pre><p>If your patch does not apply cleanly, resolve all of the
conflicts that are created (patch will tell you about these,
leaving behind .rej and .orig files for you to compare and fix up
manually using your favorite editor). This merge process can be the
most difficult part if you have made changes to portions of the
source tree that have been changed by other people.
</p><p>If you use this development process, I highly recommend
getting the excellent patchutils set of programs (found at
<a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils" target="_self">cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils</a>).
These programs enable you to manipulate text patches easily in all
sorts of useful ways, and they have saved kernel developers many
hours of tedious work.</p><p><a href="6183s1.html" target="_self">Directory Tip</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11bf2c0"></a>Source Code Control</h2></div></div><p>The process of kernel development using patch and diff
generally works quite well. But after a while, most people grow
tired of it and look for a different way to work that does not
involve so much tedious patching and merging.</p><p>A few years ago I discovered BitKeeper (available at
<a href="http://www.bitmover.com" target="_self">www.bitmover.com</a>) and
have been using it ever since for kernel development. It originally
enabled me to track easily external changes to the kernel tree and
allowed me to forward port my kernel changes with almost no effort.
Now that Linus Torvalds and Marcelo Tosatti are using BitKeeper for
their kernel development, it also allows me to send patches to them
easily for inclusion into the main kernel tree.</p><p>The use of BitKeeper as a kernel development tool is one that
a lot of people find contentious, given BitKeeper's licensing
strategy. Read over the license and decide for yourself if you
should use it. You also should go through the tutorial on the
BitMover web site to familiarize yourself with the tool and some of
the different commands.</p><p>To do kernel work with BitKeeper, you can base your kernel
off Linus' or Marcelo's kernel tree, or you can create your own,
with all of the different versions. However, unless you are
planning on using BitKeeper to send your patches to Linus or
Marcelo, I recommend creating your own kernel tree. That way you
are not buried in the vast number of different changesets that all
of the different kernel developers are creating, and you can focus
on your work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11bf528"></a>Two Trees</h2></div></div><p>Again, with BitKeeper you end up creating two different trees
(or repositories as I will now call them) to do kernel work: a
clean tree and a working tree.</p><p>To create a clean BitKeeper repository, start with a released
kernel in your working directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls
linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
</pre><p>Uncompress this kernel:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -zxf linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
$ ls
linux  linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
</pre>


Now create a BitKeeper project called linux-2.4:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bk setup linux-2.4
</pre>


BitKeeper will ask you a few questions and then provide a file to
edit where you should describe your project. Fill this out with
your favorite editor, and save it.
</p><p>You will now have a directory called linux-2.4, which is
where your project will be held. Now import the original kernel
version into the new repository:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls
linux  linux-2.4  linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
$ bk import -tplain linux linux-2.4
</pre><p>This will take some time. After BitKeeper is finished
importing all of the files, I recommend tagging this point with the
kernel version number. This will allow you to find the different
kernel versions more easily in the future:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd linux-2.4
$ bk tag LINUX_2.4.18
</pre>


Now make a clone of that repository, which is a clean kernel tree,
in a different directory so you can make your own changes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bk clone linux-2.4 greg-2.4
</pre>


All of our kernel work will be done in the greg-2.4 directory.
</p><p>You can use the -l option to bk clone. That will use a lot
less disk space and go faster by creating hard links to the
metadata files. If a file is modified, BitKeeper will break the
link and create a new one where needed. If you end up creating a
lot of different repositories on the same disk, you should use this
option.</p><p>After we are finished with our work, creating changesets by
checking in our changes all during the development process (see the
BitKeeper tutorial for more details of this), we would like to
create a patch to show our changes. This can be done with a simple
command from within the greg-2.4 directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bk export -tpatch -rLINUX_2.4.18..+ -h \
&gt; ../my_patch
</pre><p>This will create a patch showing all of the changes from the
tagged version (LINUX_2.4.18) up to the current changeset and save
it in the my_patch file. This patch can then be sent to other
people through e-mail, just like any patch created with diff. You
will notice that creating this patch was a much shorter process
than the previous method of using diff and patch.
</p><p><a href="6183s2.html" target="_self">Submitting Kernel
Patches</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x11bfbb0"></a>New Kernel Versions</h2></div></div><p>When a new kernel version is released, you will want to
forward port your changes to the new version. This is where
BitKeeper really shines over the previous patch and diff
method.</p><p>First, go to the original, clean kernel tree and import the
new patch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls
greg-2.4 linux-2.4 patch-2.4.19
$ cd linux-2.4
$ bk import -tpatch -SLINUX_2.4.19 ../patch-2.4.19 .
</pre><p>If BitKeeper thinks any files that the patch file shows as
created and deleted might actually be files that were renamed or
moved around the tree, it will pop up a GUI tool that you can use
to show manually which files were renamed, which files simply were
deleted and which ones simply were created. Figure 1 shows an
example of this dialog box.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6183f1.large.jpg"><img src="6183f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. BitKeeper Example Dialog
Box</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now go back to your working repository and pull the new
changes into it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ../greg-2.4
$ bk pull
</pre><p>BitKeeper will then merge all of the changes between kernels
2.4.18 and 2.4.19 into your working repository. If there are any
merge conflicts between any changes you have made and changes that
have showed up in the new kernel version, it will report this and
ask you what you want to do. I suggest using the graphical
three-way merge tool to help resolve these conflicts. This tool
shows the original file with the changes that you have made and the
changes that the patch (or someone else) has made. It then lets you
pick which change you want to accept, or you can hand-edit the
file, merging both changes together. Figure 2 shows an example of a
change that I made to a file that conflicts with a change that
happened in the main kernel.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6183f2.large.jpg"><img src="6183f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A Merge Conflict</p></div></div>
</p><p>After you are finished resolving any conflicts (and wasn't
that much easier than manually looking through .rej files?), you
can continue working in your updated kernel. Again, to export a
patch with all of the changes you have created, use the following
command within the greg-2.4 directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bk export -tpatch -rLINUX_2.4.19..+ -h \
&gt; ../my_patch

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x15b85e8"></a>Other Benefits of BitKeeper</h2></div></div><p>BitKeeper also allows you to see easily all of the changes
that have happened to a specific file over time. You can see if the
file was modified by one of the main kernel patches or by yourself.
An example of the changes that have happened to the
drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.c file over time in my repository can
be seen in Figure 3. With this tool, you can see what other changes
happened at the same time and even what line of code was modified
in which version.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6183f3.large.jpg"><img src="6183f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. BitKeeper Keeping Track of
Changes</p></div></div>
</p><p>One of the strongest benefits of using BitKeeper for your
kernel development is that it is a very powerful version control
system, and it allows you to work with other developers on the same
sections of code at the same time. You can allow other people to
pull from your working tree, or you can set up a local server to
store your working tree. See the BitKeeper tutorial and
documentation for some good examples of how this can be set up and
how the development life cycle can be used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10c6580.0x15b8958"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I have shown two different ways of doing Linux kernel
development, one with only patch and diff and one using BitKeeper.
Personally, BitKeeper has enabled me to spend more time actually
doing development work and less time messing with merges. It has
also kept me sane in trying to track the 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 kernel
trees for the Linux USB and Linux Hot Plug PCI drivers.</p><p><a href="6183s3.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
