    Debate continues over the best approach to real-time
    capabilities and the Linux kernel.

embedded Linux applications actually require real-time enhancements
or add-ons, articles and discussions on that subject invariably
spark passionate debate. For whatever reason, the topic is a magnet
for what might be characterized best as a sort of religious fervor.
So it is with some tiptoeing through a minefield that this month's
embedded column begins with several topics related to real-time
Linux. Hold on to your hats.

Opportunity</h2></div></div><p>In their recently published research report &ldquo;Linux's Future
in the Embedded Systems Market&rdquo;, Venture Development Corp. (VDC)
concluded that the availability of real-time solutions for Linux
are needed to accelerate the broad adoption of Linux in embedded
designs.</p><p>The report analyzes the current size and future growth of the
worldwide market for embedded Linux software solutions
(<a href="http://www.vdc-corp.com" target="_self">www.vdc-corp.com</a>).
According to the study, the dominant factors favoring the use of
Linux in embedded projects include the availability of source code,
royalty-free options and reliability. On the other hand, VDC found
&ldquo;real-time limitations&rdquo; to be the most common issue cited by
embedded developers as inhibiting their adoption of Linux for
future projects.</p><p>Here is a list, in ranked order, of what developers told VDC
were their main concerns with respect to using Linux in embedded
systems and devices:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Real-time limitations</p></li><li><p>Doubts about availability and quality of
support</p></li><li><p>Fragmentation concerns</p></li><li><p>Doubts about vendor longevity</p></li><li><p>Footprint size</p></li><li><p>Other</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1960580.0x1a58c38"></a>The Great Real-Time Linux Debate (Redux)</h2></div></div><p>The usual real-time debate erupted shortly after
<i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> published the third
article in a series by Kevin Dankwardt on real-time Linux
technologies. Here's an outline of the sequence of reactions and
responses from key players in the real-time Linux market, followed
by a pointer to where you can read them all on-line:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>MontaVista Software's Kevin Morgan issued a
response to Dankwardt's article in which he offered &ldquo;a few
clarifications (or points of view)&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Victor Yodaiken and Matt Sherer (of FSMLabs)
reacted to Kevin Morgan's response to Dankwardt's article, taking
exception to Morgan's assertion that RTLinux is &ldquo;not appropriate
for the placement of comprehensive applications&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Kevin Morgan clarified the status of MontaVista's
kernel preemption enhancements and responded to several other
issues raised in Yodaiken and Sherer's earlier comments.</p></li><li><p>Karim Yaghmour provided &ldquo;the RTAI
perspective&rdquo;--drawing attention to the nature of the API, the
usability of the methods and distinctions in the overall openness
of the specific approaches being compared.</p></li><li><p>Doug Locke, TimeSys' VP of technology, contrasted
his company's preemptible Linux implementation with the one
pioneered by MontaVista and commented on several aspects of the
preceding debate.</p></li></ul></div><p>You can access all the above, including the original
three-part <i  >ELJ</i> article by Kevin Dankwardt,

Scheduler Latency&rdquo;, in which he compares the performance of two
popular methods for improving Linux kernel preemption latency&mdash;the
preemption patch pioneered by MontaVista and the low-latency patch
pioneered by Ingo Molnar&mdash;and discovers that the best approach
might be a combination of the two
(<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8906594941.html" target="_self">www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8906594941.html</a>).</p><p>The ADEOS Project announced its first release of ADEOS, a
hardware abstraction layer that allows a real-time kernel and a
general-purpose kernel to coexist on one CPU. The announcement
claims that &ldquo;RTAI will eventually use ADEOS services, thus
offering a real-time kernel based on a principle clearly different
from the 5,995,745 US Patent&rdquo;, aka the &ldquo;RTLinux patent&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/adeos" target="_self">www.freesoftware.fsf.org/adeos</a>).</p><p>Victor Yodaiken published a whitepaper that points out the
disadvantages of dealing with the issue of &ldquo;priority inversion&rdquo;
in real-time systems by means of a commonly used method known as
&ldquo;priority inheritance&rdquo;. Priority inversion refers to the
situation when a scheduled task must wait for a lower-priority task
to complete. In the whitepaper, Yodaiken describes &ldquo;the classical
nightmare case&rdquo; of priority inversion as being &ldquo;when a low
priority task owns a resource, a high priority task is blocked
[and] waiting for the resource, and intermediate priority tasks
keep preempting the low priority task so it cannot make progress
toward releasing the resource.&rdquo; Yodaiken says the technique of
priority inheritance is intended to allow:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>a task that is blocked waiting for a resource [to
pass] its priority down to the owner. The low priority task is
[thus] considered to be acting on behalf of the highest priority
blocked task and inheritance prevents intermediate priority tasks
from interfering.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, &ldquo;priority inheritance is neither efficient nor
reliable&rdquo;, the paper argues, and its &ldquo;implementations are either
incomplete (and unreliable) or surprisingly complex and
intrusive&rdquo;, asserts Yodaiken
(<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7168794919.html" target="_self">www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7168794919.html</a>).

Strategy</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat discontinued development of its eCos open-source
embedded operating system and is rumored to have discontinued many
of its embedded Linux development efforts.</p><p>Asked whether Red Hat was still in the embedded market, Red
Hat Chief Technology Officer Michael Tiemann replied, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but
our strategy is to expand the scope of Linux to encompass the
embedded space.&rdquo; Expanding on this point, Tiemann said &ldquo;the
embedded world that [Red Hat is] most interested in needs a Linux
platform that extends into the embedded space&rdquo;, as opposed to a
unique version of Linux tailored specifically to embedded
devices.</p><p>These statements explain Red Hat's move away from products
like eCos, an open-source embedded operating system that Red Hat
inherited via its acquisition of Cygnus Solutions in late 1999, and
&micro;Clinux, a version of Linux geared toward
resource-constrained, &ldquo;deeply embedded&rdquo; devices that Red Hat got
involved in via its mid-2000 acquisition of Wirespeed. In addition,
Tiemann's reduced investment statements explain Red Hat's
developing embedded-oriented tools, like the Embedded Linux
Developers Suite (ELDS).</p><p>Tiemann elaborates on what he means by &ldquo;a Linux platform
that extends into the embedded space&rdquo; in a guest editorial for
LinuxDevices.com entitled, &ldquo;How Linux will Revolutionize the
Embedded Market&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7248149889.html" target="_self">www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7248149889.html</a>).
That editorial basically unfolds a strategy that treats the
embedded market as a portion of a continuum&mdash;one that increasingly
demands greater consistency of technology, APIs, middleware and
tools, due to growing end-to-end application connectivity and
interoperability.</p><p>The best approach, Tiemann argues, is to offer a solution
that meets the needs of the entire range of requirements within a
single <span   class="emphasis"><em>platform</em></span>, rather than providing a
unique version of Linux specially tailored to embedded systems.
Quoting from the conclusion,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The deeper I look into environments adopting
Linux, from embedded to enterprise, the more I believe that Linux
has the requisite DNA and development model to scale truly from
embedded to enterprise as a single platform, and Red Hat's focus
will remain on ensuring that what works for the mainframe, and the
server, and the workstation, also works for the appliance, the
carrier, the router, the PDA, and the cell phone; and, of course,
vice-versa.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1960580.0x1a599f8"></a>Three Reviews on Hollabaugh's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded
