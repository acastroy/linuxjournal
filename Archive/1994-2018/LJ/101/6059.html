    Cal discusses mtrace, dmalloc and memwatch&mdash;three
    easy-to-use tools that find most application program errors.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef0580.0xfe8500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the problems with developing
embedded systems is the detection of memory leaks; I've found three
tools that are useful for this. These tools are used to detect
application program errors, not kernel memory leaks. Two of these
tools (mtrace and dmalloc) are part of the MontaVista Linux
Professional Edition 2.1 product. The other (memwatch) is available
from the Web (see Resources).
</p><p>C and C++ programmers control dynamic memory allocation.
Reckless use of this control can lead to memory management
problems, which cause performance degradation, unpredictable
execution or crashes.</p><p>Some of the problems that cause memory leaks are writing or
reading beyond an allocated memory segment or trying to free memory
that has already been freed. A memory leak occurs when memory is
allocated and not freed after use, or when the pointer to a memory
allocation is deleted, rendering the memory no longer usable.
Memory leaks degrade performance due to increased paging, and over
time, cause a program to run out of memory and crash. Access errors
lead to data corruption, which causes a program to behave
incorrectly or crash. When a program runs out of memory it also can
cause the Linux kernel to crash.</p><p>Designing and programming an embedded application requires
great care. The application must be robust enough to handle every
possible error that can occur; care should be taken to anticipate
these errors and handle them accordingly&mdash;especially in the area of
memory. Often an application can run for some time before it
mysteriously crashes itself or the system as a result of a memory
allocation that is never freed. Finding these errors can be done
through use of memory leak detectors.</p><p>These tools work by replacing malloc, free and other memory
management calls. Each tool has code that intercepts calls to
malloc (and other functions) and sets up tracking information for
each memory request. Some tools implement memory protection fences
to catch errant memory accesses.</p><p>Some of the leak detection programs are very large and
require a virtual memory image of the program being searched. This
requirement makes it very difficult to use on embedded systems.
However, mtrace, memwatch and dmalloc are simple programs that find
most errors.</p><p>All three tools were run on one example C program containing
common memory handling errors. This program, together with
Makefiles for building it with the three tools, is available as a
downloadable file at
<a href="../listings/101/6059.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue101/6059.tgz</a>.
All of these tools have been used in several different target
architectures. The example code will work whether compiled natively
or cross-compiled.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef0580.0xfe8870"></a>mtrace</h2></div></div><p>The simplest of the three tools is mtrace. A feature of the
GNU C library, mtrace allows detection of memory leaks caused by
unbalanced malloc/free calls. It is implemented as a function call,
mtrace(), which turns on tracing and creates a log file of
addresses malloc'd and freed. A Perl script, also called mtrace,
displays the log file, listing only the unbalanced combinations
and&mdash;if the source file is available&mdash;the line number of the
source where the malloc occurred. The tool can be used to check
both C and C++ programs under Linux. One of the features that makes
mtrace desirable is the fact that it is scalable. It can be used to
do overall program debugging but can be scaled to work on a module
basis as well.</p><p>Key to the use of the mtrace feature are three items: include
mcheck.h, set the MALLOC_TRACE environment variable and call the
mtrace() function call. If the MALLOC_TRACE variable is not set,
mtrace() does nothing.</p><p>The output of mtrace includes messages such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
- 0x0804a0f8 Free 13 was never alloc'd
/memory_leak/memory_leaks/mtrace/my_test.c:193
</pre><p>to indicate memory that was freed but never malloc'd and a
&ldquo;Memory not freed&rdquo; section that includes the address, size and
line number of calls to malloc for which no free occurred.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef0580.0xfe8ad8"></a>memwatch</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>memwatch</b></span> is a program that
not only detects malloc and free errors but also fencepost
conditions. Fencepost conditions occur when writing data into an
allocated chunk of memory (allocated by malloc) and the data goes
beyond the end of the allocated area. Some things that memwatch
does not catch are writing to an address that has been freed and
reading data from outside the allocated memory.</p><p>The heart of memwatch is the memwatch.c file. It implements
the wrappers and code for the address checking. To use memwatch the
file memwatch.h must be included in the source. The variables
MEMWATCH and MW_STDIO must be defined on the compile command line
(-DMEMWATCH and -DMW_STDIO). The memwatch.c file must be used with
the application as well. The object module from the compile of
memwatch.c must be included in the link of the application. Upon
execution of the application, a message will appear on stdout if
memwatch found any abnormalities. The file memwatch.log is created
that contains the information about the errors encountered. Each
error message contains the line number and source-code filename
where the error occurred.</p><p>Comparing memwatch.log with the log from mtrace, the same
errors are reported. The memwatch tool also found a fencepost
condition where the memory addresses were changed to overwrite the
start and end of an allocated area, showing the expanded capability
of memwatch in this case. The disadvantage is that memwatch is not
scalable. It has to run on the whole application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xef0580.0xfe8ce8"></a>dmalloc</h2></div></div><p>The third tool is a library that is designed as a drop-in
substitute for malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other memory
management functions. It provides runtime configurability. The
features of the tool provide memory leak tracing and fencepost
write detection. It reports its errors by filename and line number
and logs some general statistics. This library, created and
maintained by Gray Watson, has been ported to many operating
systems other than Linux.</p><p>The package is configurable to include thread support and C++
support. It can be built both as shared and static libraries. All
of these options are selected when building the tool. The result is
a set of libraries that are used when linking the application
program. There is an include file (dmalloc.h) that needs to be
included in the source of the application to be checked. In
addition to the library and include file, it is necessary to have
an environment variable set up that dmalloc reads to configure how
it checks and where it puts the logging information. The following
line is the setup used with the test program for dmalloc:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export \
DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x44a40503,inter=1,log=logfile
</pre><p>What this means is 1) log is a file named logfile in the
current directory, 2) inter is the frequency for the library to
check itself and 3) debug is a hex number whose bits select the
types of checking to do. This example tests for just about every
possible error. The following is a list of the tests and the
corresponding bits to set in &ldquo;debug&rdquo;:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>none (nil): no functionality (0)</p></li><li><p>log-stats (lst): log general statistics

pointers (0x20000000)</p></li><li><p>error-dump (edu): dump core on error and then
continue (0x40000000)</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>If the library needs to check C++ programs, a source file
named dmalloc.cc is needed with the application. This module
provides wrapper functions for new to malloc and delete to free.
The GNU debugger GDB can be used with dmalloc. A file is included
with the product that can be used as part of a .gdbinit file so
that GDB is set up automatically to know about dmalloc.</p><p>Along with the library is a utility named dmalloc that will
programmatically set up the DMALLOC_OPTIONS variable. I've made a
setup script that is sourced prior to running the program to be
debugged. This way the setup is repeatable without errors.</p><p>This article only covers the general use of the tool, but the
documentation for it is extensive and details more available
features. The test program used with the earlier tools was run
using DMALLOC. The results can be lengthy and optionally include
the bytes present at critical areas of memory such as the
&ldquo;fence-top&rdquo;, where a pointer overruns a malloc'd area. The end of
the log file includes statistics, addresses, block sizes and line
numbers for occurrences of malloc without free.</p><p>The three tools provide varying support for memory leak
detection and reporting. Each of these tools has been used on a
Linux workstation as well as cross-compiled and executed on several
different target architectures. In one application, developers used
all three tools. <span   class="bold"><b>mtrace</b></span> was used
to find a memory leak in a third-party C++ library where an
exception throw/catch block caused a major leak. The dmalloc tool
was used to find memory leaks in the execution of Linux pthreaded
applications. The memwatch tool was used to catch a buffer pool
mechanism that was not properly defragmenting itself. These tools
are small and easy to implement and remove when debugging is
completed.</p><p>The example program consists of one source file, my_test.c.
There are three separate directories that contain a README,
Makefile and a script to run the test [available at
<a href="../listings/101/6059.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue101/6059.tgz</a>].
In the dmalloc test, the environment setup script is also
available. Each of the tests has been built on Red Hat and SuSE
Linux releases, as well as the MontaVista Linux cross-development
environments.</p><p><a href="6059s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
