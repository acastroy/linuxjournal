    We present this year's winners and a few honorable mentions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9d298"></a></h2></div></div><p>This year, in order to draw upon a wider
base of knowledge and experience, we made some modifications to the
process of choosing the winners of the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Editors' Choice Awards. We started by selecting
a board of over 50 Linux experts, chosen largely from among the
best and brightest of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
contributors. This board, after receiving the categories, was
charged with coming up with nominees for each. Once we had the
nominees and the board's comments on each one, we passed them on to
our contributing editors for their input. Armed with this
information, our editorial team made the final decisions.
</p><p>This year, we see an unusual number of free and open-source
software products among the winners. This is not a sign that
commercial products are in decline, either in quantity or quality,
but rather a reflection of the maturity of many open-source
projects. There were a number of commercial products that also
ranked highly with the nomination board, and in those cases where
one product received a high number of nominations, but won no
award, we included it as an honorable mention.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9d4a8"></a>Server Appliance: SnapGear Lite/Lite+ SOHO
Firewall/VPN Client</h2></div></div><p>We ran a review of the SnapGear Lite in the
<i  >LJ</i> April 2002 issue
(<a href="../096/5744.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5744</a>)
and concluded that for the price and functionality, it can't be
beat. For $249-$299 US (depending on whether you get the Lite or
the Lite+) you get, in addition to firewall and NAT functionality,
a hardware-based VPN client that can emulate Microsoft's
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, letting you use a Linux machine
to access a Microsoft VPN.</p><p>SnapGear's products are based on the SecureEdge platform,
developed when SnapGear was merged with Lineo (in the days when
Lineo was in the business of acquiring companies). SnapGear has
spun off into its own company again for some time now and seems to
be doing very well with their line of Linux-based routers, which
allows them pricing significantly lower than much of their
competition.</p><p>Honorable Mention: Sun Microsystems' Cobalt Qube</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9d710"></a>Security Tool: GPG</h2></div></div><p>Did you notice how much more cryptographically signed e-mail
you got during the past year? You should thank the developers of
your favorite mailer for making mail signing, encryption and
checking easy, but most of all, thank the GNU Privacy Guard
developers for offering a compatible replacement for the original
Pretty Good Privacy, which vanished in a flurry of&mdash;all together
now&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Corporate Shenanigans</em></span>. Now, there's no
excuse for not being able to send and receive secure mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9d870"></a>Web Server: IBM X-Series</h2></div></div><p>It seems like everybody's making rackmount Linux web servers.
What's IBM have that the others don't? A smooth web ordering
process, whatever service and support level you desire, and they'll
support their hardware running Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE or
Turbolinux. Quite a choice.</p><p>Honorable Mention: Sun Microsystems' Cobalt RaQ XTR</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9d9d0"></a>Enterprise Application Server: Zope</h2></div></div><p>Before the Web, how often did DBAs and graphic designers get
a chance to call each other productivity-sucking idiots or worse?
Ever since web site management got big and professional, we've
known that graphic designers don't want to work on templates, but
sites full of static luscious-looking pages get unmanageable real
fast, and the answer is a database and a templating system.</p><p>Now, let the graphics people work with WYSIWYG tools if they
like&mdash;Zope offers a clever templating system that makes the
templates work in the WYSIWYG tool when it's time to modify them.
Everyone else will appreciate the load-balancing capability and, of
course, the Free Software license.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9db30"></a>Technical Workstation: HP x4000</h2></div></div><p>We first saw this machine at LinuxWorld New York, 2002 where
it was being displayed with high-end graphics applications such as
Maya for Linux. Our impressions of its high-performance
capabilities were confirmed by the review we ran in the
<i  >LJ</i> June 2002 issue, in which reviewer Thad
Beier used the words &ldquo;shockingly faster&rdquo; to describe the x4000 in
comparison with machines he was used to. Thad used the machine to
run resource-gobbling effects software and simply was blown away
with the performance. As tested, with two 2.2GHz processors, 4GB of
RDRAM, it's not hard to imagine that he would be. Of course HP
ships the x4000 with Linux (Red Hat) preloaded. HP offers the x4000
in a number of configuration options, so you can get what you need
regardless of whether you're running an effects studio or running
complex Verilog simulations with Icarus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9dc90"></a>Web Client: Mozilla and Galeon</h2></div></div><p>As some web browsers have grown huge with features and others
have gone the lean and fast route, we chose two winners. So ask
yourself: do you like your web browser thick and juicy or simply as
a thin component of your desktop? Either way, we don't cut the
browser any slack when it comes to honoring the W3C's standards.
Web standards are the only reason we can use the software of our
choice to browse sites that webmasters create with the software of
their choice&mdash;it's the social contract that underlies freedom. &ldquo;No
browser does a better job of standards compliance&rdquo; is what the Web
Standards Project says about Mozilla, and that's good for everyone.
So pick Mozilla, the super-deluxe, super-themeable browser, and get
mail, news, password management and other power features, or get
Galeon, a light browser that doesn't duplicate your other GNOME
applications.</p><p>Honorable Mention: Konqueror</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9ddf0"></a>Graphics Application: The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>If you're like most Linux users, you fire up The GIMP for
miscellaneous image tasks such as converting and cropping photos
for your web site. But The GIMP is much more than that. It's
becoming one of those great platforms, like Perl and Apache, that
becomes a natural starting point for a development and support
community. The GIMP has a lot of functionality that takes awhile to
learn, including not one but two built-in scripting languages.
Check out
<a href="http://manual.gimp.org" target="_self">manual.gimp.org</a> for an
on-line manual.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9df50"></a>Communication Tool: Evolution Mailer</h2></div></div><p>We've been watching our contributors' headers to see what
mailers they use, and the unthinkable is happening. Linux gurus are
dropping text-based mailers for a GUI mailer called Evolution (more
on this disturbing situation as it develops). Besides mail,
Evolution also offers a calendar and to-do list. We like the idea
of being able to compose more than one message at once, but our
vi-trained fingers wouldn't get very far without integrating Jason
Hildebrand's gnome-vim.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e058"></a>Consumer Software: KDE 3.0</h2></div></div><p>KDE 2.0 represented real progress toward making Linux a more
viable option for many people on the desktop. There was a lot of
great ideas, such as a super-customizable desktop. Unfortunately,
there was also plenty that didn't work, or at least didn't work
right. KDE 3.0, while it doesn't look much different, offers the
goods that KDE 2.0 seemed to promise and more, including a much
higher level of stability and new functionality for many
applications, including Konqueror (like the ability to disable
JavaScript pop-up windows) and KMail. KDE 3.0 gives all these GUI
goodies without forgetting the command-line user: Konsole, the KDE
terminal window, also comes with additional functionality and lets
you monitor for new (or no) activity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e160"></a>Development Tool: Emacs</h2></div></div><p>With all the impressive development tools for Linux coming
out of late, it's easy to ignore the extensive IDE capabilities of
Emacs, as Charles Curley points out in his article on Emacs in the
<i  >LJ</i> June 2002 issue. Emacs' high level of
support for customization makes it a favorite among hackers. Not
only does it support many languages, but features such as Electric
C (for automation of indentation and pretty printing), spell
checking and the ability to act as a front end for GCC, GDB and CVS
make it a sensible choice for a lot of programming needs. For those
unaccustomed to the Free Software world, it's hard to believe it's
free&mdash;and it's been there all along.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: KDevelop and Borland's Kylix</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e318"></a>Database: MySQL</h2></div></div><p>If you're one of the people who has been saying, &ldquo;I can't
use MySQL because it doesn't have [feature you need here]&rdquo;, it's
time to read up on MySQL 4.0 and try it out on a development
system. Can you say, &ldquo;full support for transactions and row-level
locking&rdquo;? &ldquo;UNION&rdquo;? &ldquo;Full text search&rdquo;?</p><p>The new MySQL is even available as a library you can compile
into your application. Proprietary licenses are available if you
can't use the GPL.</p><p>Honorable Mention: PostgreSQL</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e4d0"></a>Backup Software: Sistina Software's Logical
Volume Manager for Linux</h2></div></div><p>No matter what your backup plan is, and what hardware and
software you use to handle the mundane details of copying your
working files to off-line storage, you need to make a copy that's
internally consistent. This is especially critical when you're
backing up a database. (For a simple example, say that you keep
your users' home directories by state, and Joe moves from
/home/washington/joe to /home/alabama/joe while you're backing up
missouri. Where's Joe's home directory on the tape?
Nowhere!)</p><p>Expensive proprietary UNIX systems have had a solution for
years: filesystems that support taking a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo;, which looks
like your working filesystem frozen in time. Instead of &ldquo;shut down
the database, dump it to tape, start up the database&rdquo;, it's &ldquo;shut
down the database, snapshot, start up the database, dump the
snapshot to tape&rdquo;&mdash;quite a time-saver. Thanks to Sistina Software,
Linux now has this essential feature for backing up busy
servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e630"></a>Office Application: OpenOffice 1.0</h2></div></div><p>With Sun now charging for StarOffice 6.0 (with its increased
functionality and the proprietary elements that go with it), it's
very nice that they support OpenOffice and continue to make it
available for free. For those who can do without certain features
such as document templates and a grammar checker, OpenOffice offers
an amazing amount of functionality and advanced features that come
very close indeed to matching those of MS Word. Some of these
features are autocorrect/autoformat modes, the ability to compare
documents and include cross-references, fields, an equation editor
and global customization settings. OpenOffice can import OLE
objects and charts and does a pretty good job of both importing and
exporting files in the MS Word format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e738"></a>Mobile Device: Sharp Zaurus</h2></div></div><p>See &ldquo;Product of the Year&rdquo; below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e840"></a>Training and Certification Program: LPI</h2></div></div><p>The Linux Professional Institute reports that more than
10,000 people have taken the exams to become LPI-certified.
Training is available in classroom settings or on IBM's
developerWorks web site, and the exams are tough but fair.
Certification can't promise you a job, but if you get a chance to
go for it, it shows potential employers you are keeping your skills
up to date.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9e948"></a>Game: <span   class="emphasis"><em>TuxRacer</em></span></h2></div></div><p>This little open-source game has had more than one million
downloads. It offers nice 3-D graphics, and you even can create
your own courses with almost any paint program (The GIMP, for
instance). As former contributing editor Neil Doane says, &ldquo;If
there's anything better than 3-D high-speed belly surfing downhill
competition penguin racing, I haven't found it.&rdquo;</p><p>Honorable Mention: <span   class="emphasis"><em>PySol</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x1d9eb58"></a>Books: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers, 2nd
Edition</em></span> by Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a
Connected World</em></span> by Lawrence Lessig</h2></div></div><p>With the number of political and legal issues surrounding
free and open-source software, and the books written that address
them, we thought it best to choose a winner for both a technical
and a nontechnical book this year.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> has been a
must-have book for people getting into kernel development, and 2001
saw the release of a 2.4-oriented second edition. You'll still need
your <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscription for some of
the newer stuff, but this book is an excellent introduction and
field guide to the source code. The paper format is handy, but you
can use the on-line version for previewing and as a quick
reference.</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in
a Connected World</em></span>, Lawrence Lessig writes,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A time is marked not so much by ideas that are
argued about as by ideas that are taken for granted. The character
of an era hangs upon what needs no defense. Power runs with ideas
that only the crazy would draw into doubt. The &ldquo;taken for
granted&rdquo; is the test of sanity; &ldquo;what everyone knows&rdquo; is the
line between us and them.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks to Larry and his latest book, the public nature of the
Net has a far better chance of being taken for granted than it ever
would have had without them.
</p><p>Before Larry began writing and talking about the
&ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; architecture of the Net and its place-like nature as
a &ldquo;Commons&rdquo;, those ideas were taken for granted by a rather small
<span   class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span>&mdash;a population that surely included the
majority of <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers. It may take
some time before everyone knows and agrees with these ideas; but
they are spreading fast. After they achieve ubiquity (and we have
faith they will), Professor Lessig will be remembered as one of the
Net's true heroes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x2197328"></a>Web Site: Google</h2></div></div><p>What more can you say about the world's growing dependency on
more than 10,000 Linux boxes behind the most popular search engine?
Never in the history of the Web has there been a site that has done
more with less hype than Google. Its few self-serving messages do
little or nothing to compromise the vast white space that surrounds
the one thing people come there to use: the search box. Paid
advertising appears alongside search results, but it never
intrudes. And so much of it is useful to both seller and searcher
that Google actually has a going business that makes money.</p><p>In the last year or so the company has added image and
newsgroup searches to its front page, and a catalog engine has been
in the works as well. And lately, the company has added an API that
lets developers query web documents using SOAP and WSDL protocols
for noncommercial purposes.</p><p>The search engine also acts, in an oblique manner, as an
anti-censorship tool. Google will remove pages from its index in
response to take-down letters written under the controversial
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but there's a catch for would-be
DMCA censors. After the Church of Scientology attacked the
expos&eacute; site <a href="http://xenu.net" target="_self">xenu.net</a>,
Google began reporting take downs to the free speech watchdog site
<a href="http://chillingeffects.org" target="_self">chillingeffects.org</a>.
When corporations try to censor Google results, they just bring
more attention to their victims.</p><p>While Google's policies may not please everybody, it has kept
better faith with users than any other search engine, and for that
it deserves all its ample success.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca5580.0x21975e8"></a>Product of the Year: Sharp Zaurus</h2></div></div><p>Two words describe this past year: Zaurus Frenzy. We dig
Trolltech's palmtop Qtopia environment, based on the popular Qt
toolkit. It's got all the classic PDA stuff, such as address book
and calendar, plus a selection of nifty games and good office and
web software.</p><p>The Qtopia development boom owes a lot to the shining promise
of the first Qtopia-based product, Sharp's Zaurus PDA, which offers
all the hardware features you might want, including optional
wireless networking, high-quality audio, a keyboard and a
replaceable, rechargeable battery.</p><p>Our embedded Linux news archive for 2001 was full of
companies committing to offer applications, services and training
for Qtopia and the Zaurus. When you get one you'll know why.</p></div></div>
