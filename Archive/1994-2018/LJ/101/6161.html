London</h2></div></div><p>
I travel around the US so much that I usually make sure I have
local net-access numbers before I leave. Mostly this involves
keeping an EarthLink account because EarthLink has a lot of numbers
and requires no special client software to access them, but travel
overseas is another matter. I've only gone twice in the last two
years, and both times I departed unprepared.</p><p>The first trip was in the fall of 2000 to Lucerne in
Switzerland. None of the local-access numbers for EarthLink worked,
nor the numbers for my hosting ISP's local Swiss &ldquo;partner&rdquo;. I
gave up and called numbers in the states.</p><p>The second trip was last week (it's mid-June 2002 as I write
this). Before I left, EarthLink told me they were no longer
(despite their name) offering overseas access, and I didn't have
time to hassle with joining AT&amp;T's system, which apparently has
access numbers around the world but evidently exposes them only
through their Windows client dialing software. Just before I left,
I quickly engaged the services of two resellers of a &ldquo;global
roaming&rdquo; provider called iPass
(<a href="http://ipass.com" target="_self">ipass.com</a>) and headed for
Munich. It looked easy: a $5.00 setup charge, plus somewhere
between $.03 and $.23 per minute once I got on-line.</p><p>But I never could figure out how to get local numbers from
either of the iPass OEMs (one eventually wrote to apologize for
never getting me on the system, which could only be set up by phone
call with a salesperson). However, it didn't matter because
something miraculous arrived before I did: wireless net
access.</p><p>Our hotel in Munich featured a wireless signal covering the
lobby and meeting rooms. They sold it in the form of a card with an
ID and a password hidden behind one of those scratch-off black
patches they use on lottery tickets. You can buy two hours for 9
Euros or 24 hours for 29 Euros. (Not cheap, but very handy.) You
simply fire up a browser, go to a URL specified on the card, enter
your ID and password, and you're on for as long as the meter
runs.</p><p>The event was JabberConf
(<a href="http://www.jabberconf.com" target="_self">www.jabberconf.com</a>),
where the techies on staff offered plenty of bandwidth as well&mdash;all
of it free for anybody who wanted it. Unfortunately, their WiFi
base station had some kind of problem, so everybody had to share an
eight-port hub out in the hall. I wanted to be live on the Net in
the meeting rooms, so I paid the hotel for the privilege, and it
worked very well.</p><p>But the mindblower came when I arrived in London. After
failing once again at dial-up from my hotel, I went down to the
local internet caf&eacute;. There I paid a few pounds to sit for a
couple hours with my laptop jacked into the Net, looking for local
wireless access points. It took awhile, but I eventually hit pay
dirt in the form of Consume.net
(<a href="http://consume.net" target="_self">consume.net</a>), the FAQ of
which modestly describes its mission as &ldquo;a collaborative strategy
for the self provision of a broadband telecommunications
infrastructure&rdquo;. And indeed, that's what it is.</p><p>The top link on the left column of the main index page is
&ldquo;Nodes&rdquo;. Clicking here brings up a map with little circles all
over it, each bearing the name of an access point. Some, like Hyde
Park and Greenwich University, are relatively obvious locations&mdash;if
you're a local, which I'm not. Most are obscure: &ldquo;twenteenth
node&rdquo;, &ldquo;dude&rdquo;, &ldquo;neotokyo&rdquo;. But after I subtracted out all but
the operational nodes (marked green), I found that the nearest one,
called Kynance Mews, was a short walk up Gloucester Road from my
hotel on Cromwell, in South Kensington.</p><p>When I clicked on &ldquo;get node info&rdquo;, a page with an abundance
of useful information appeared. In addition to the name of the
node, it featured coordinates by both latitude/longitude and the
Ordnance Survey, links to detailed street maps and aerial
photographs and a list of every other node within 4,000 meters,
including distance (to the meter) and compass bearing (to the
degree). The description read, &ldquo;Up and running&mdash;covering Kynance
Mews and Kynance Place. This includes two caf&eacute;s with good
coffee and outside seating. Hurrah!&rdquo;</p><p>So I walked straight up Gloucester, and sure enough, a signal
presented itself as soon as I passed the parallel entries to
Kynance Mews and Kynance Place. Down at the other end of the latter
was a pretty little French caf&eacute; with outdoor seating called
Petite D&eacute;lice. So I went down there, ordered a coffee and a
pastry, sat down, opened my laptop and found I was already on the
Net. The node identified as Kynance Community Wireless, assigned me
a DHCP address and let me at the bandwidth. To further perfect the
situation, the sky had turned to puffy blue clouds, the air was
warm, the flowers blooming, the birds singing and South Kensington
looked as postcard-perfect as you can imagine.</p><p>Two tables away another patron was sitting at a table talking
about &ldquo;access&rdquo; to a tall and familiar-looking young gentleman
walking a very friendly greyhound. I called over and said &ldquo;Excuse
me, is this your node I'm on?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, he said, and came over. A
look of recognition crossed his face and he said, &ldquo;You're Doc
Searls!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I replied. After uttering a delighted expletive,
he held out his hand and introduced himself as Ben
Hammersley.</p><p>That would be the same Ben Hammersley who writes for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>London Times</em></span>, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Guardian</em></span> and O'Reilly Books, for which he's
currently working on an authoritative piece on RSS. He also writes
four different weblogs and had recently attended O'Reilly's
Emerging Technologies Conference in Santa Clara, California, which
is why I sort-of recognized him, because I was there too.</p><p>I shortly found out that Ben's node hangs off a Linux box and
that Consume.net is served up by Linux and Apache as well. The
connections, however, only began there. Soon we were joined by
Ben's wife Anna (whose father is Olof Soderblom, inventor of Token
Ring), and my assimilation into the Hammersley's techno-social
network began, along with a crash course on grassroots
infrastructure building that I'm sure would never proceed so
quickly without Linux and allied free and open protocols&mdash;along
with resourceful hackers to make the most of them.</p><p>For example, I learned about <span   class="emphasis"><em>warwalking</em></span>.
The &ldquo;war&rdquo; in this case is not combat, but Wireless Access
Reconnaissance. Matt Jones, architect of BBC Interactive, explained
to me that warwalking was the pedestrian equivalent of wardriving,
which reportedly got its name from the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>War
Games</em></span>. In either case, it's still about reconnaissance.
Services like Consume.net just take some of the work out of
it.</p><p>One of the other wireless patrons at Petite D&eacute;lice
told me there are downloadable scripts that will turn your laptop
into something like a Geiger counter for WiFi. That way, you can
walk around town with a closed laptop in hand, wearing headphones
that make a sound when the laptop picks up WiFi signals. Matt even
showed me hand-drawn schematics for his own variant of warwalking,
called warchalking. With warchalking, hackers can use chalk to mark
local-access status on curbs and sidewalks, much as service workers
use spray paint on pavement to identify subterranean plumbing and
electrical services. A closed circle might mean the presence of a
closed access point, while an open circle (two halves, back to
back) would identify an open network. Matt plans to write this up
by the time this hits print. You should be able to find pointers
somewhere amidst his main personal site,
<a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com" target="_self">www.blackbeltjones.com</a>.</p><p>Not that everybody is going about this in perfect harmony.
One of my new friends in London is Yoz Graheme
(<a href="http://yoz.com" target="_self">yoz.com</a>), source of &ldquo;Perl is
Internet Yiddish&rdquo; and other memorable lines. When I asked Yoz
about Consume.net's Linux connections, he wrote back, &ldquo;I think
(they) are using Linux but being notoriously closed about their
code....I'm not sure of the whole story there, but I know it's
causing a fair degree of consternation.&rdquo;</p><p>But Consume.net is not the only grassroots wireless movement
in London. Another high-profile effort is free2air.org
(<a href="http://www.free2air.org" target="_self">www.free2air.org</a>),
which has a global scope with an apparently strong UK constituency.
Naturally, their site is served by Apache on Linux.</p><p>As it happens, I was in London to address some high-level
civil servants on how technologists and ordinary citizens in free
markets were taking both infrastructure and government into their
own hands&mdash;using Linux and other technology developments as
examples. I spoke on my last day there, so I had a lot to report
about what was happening locally, complete with digital photographs
I had been taking since I arrived. One photo, titled &ldquo;An
Exploration of Infrastructure Irony&rdquo;, was a telephoto shot of the
top of an idle phone booth, with Ben Hammersley's base station in a
window behind it. The entire time I spent on Kynance Place, I saw
nobody using that telephone. Meanwhile, I have no idea how many
people used Ben's node to access the Net for free&mdash;more than a few,
I'm sure.</p><p>What these hackers were producing, I pointed out,
demonstrated how the Net sees choke points as failures and routes
around them. I also suggested that the same kind of thing would be
happening with governments as well. &ldquo;This isn't 'power to the
people&rdquo;', I said. &ldquo;It's power from the people&rdquo;, and there is a
huge difference. The Net is made &ldquo;of, by and for the people&rdquo; in a
very literal sense.</p><p>Much of the talk among my hacker friends in London was about
politics. As with the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and
subsequent lawmaking in the US, the UK has had its share of
net-hostile legislation and organizations formed to fight it.
Foremost among those is STAND
(<a href="http://stand.org.uk" target="_self">stand.org.uk</a>). Matt Jones
explains:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>STAND was created by a bunch of us in early 1998
to fight the Electronic Commerce bill, which we went several rounds
with until it became the RIP bill, and then Act. However, in doing
that, we created some faxing technology that we knew was useful on
its own, and so created FaxYourMP as a notionally separate entity
(FYMP is determinedly nonpartisan; STAND is totally single-issue
lobbying&mdash;both happen to be run by the same people). STAND went
into hibernation when RIP went through but was very recently (as in
a couple of weeks ago) brought back in a new form by Danny O'Brien,
who is one of the team, to fight the RIPA extensions. The FYMP code
is a mess of PHP, MySQL and various other open-source things, and
it mainly runs on FreeBSD boxes. We've often thought of opening the
code, but we'd have to substantially clean it up first, and it's
way too bitty. Besides, the value is in the setup as a whole, and
it still takes regular administration and cash to keep it running.
As I said, the software tools are free, but the things that cost
are a) the fax calls, because local calls still cost money here and
b) the data, which matches a user's postcode to an MP, which is
copyrighted and has to be bought.</p></blockquote></div><p>After I arrived back in the US, a flurry of e-mails delivered
news that the STAND site described this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As most of you will already have heard, the
government has backed down from the RIP s22 Order that would have
given access to traffic data to dozens of government departments.
We thought you'd like to know that this U-turn was largely down to
you.
</p><p>The FaxYourMP folk say that they relayed 1,789 faxes from
last Monday and estimate that around 1,600 of those were related to
the s22 RIP Order. That means that, on average, every MP received
at least two messages expressing concern over the measure.</p><p>We've received mail from constituents saying that their
Member of Parliament called them directly to discuss the issue.
We've had MPs mail us with advice. We've had TV companies and
newspapers contact us after they'd been hassled by their readers
and viewers. We've even had MPs writing letters to constituents
explaining, mournfully, that there was nothing they could do&mdash;and
then had their own voters explain to them how to attend Standing
Committee debates and who to contact to help fight this order. Ah,
those apathetic votees.</p></blockquote></div><p>Power from the people. It happened with the Net. It happened
with Linux. It's happening with WiFi. And it's going to happen with
government too. Count on it.</p></div></div>
