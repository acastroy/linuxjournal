Plex used to be one more option for media consumption. Now it's
starting to become <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> option.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x275a3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you aren't using Plex in your home network, this guide might be all the
reason you need to start doing so today. I've been using Plex for years,
and unlike all the other programs and hardware options I've tried for
media streaming in the past, Plex continues to get better and better
instead of just dying out. I have boxes full of things like Popcorn
Hour media streamers, Boxee Boxes, Cubox Kodi machines and countless
other devices that were the best of breed at one point or another. But
Plex has never let me down, and now it has so many features and hardware
integrations, I don't see it going away any time soon. So in this article, I 
describe setting up a Plex infrastructure. There's no single way
to do it, so let's start at the beginning: the server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x275a568"></a>
Server Options</h2></div></div><p>
Plex will run on a wide variety of platforms. Most NAS devices will run
the plexmediaserver application, and it will run on Windows, Linux
or OS X. Although running on a NAS seems like the logical place to have
it run, the unfortunate downside is that NAS devices aren't powerful
enough to transcode media for streaming. Basically, unless the file is
in the exact format needed for your playback device (web, Android, Roku and
so on),
the server will transcode media on the fly so you can watch it. In
order to transcode, you'll want as much CPU as you can afford. This is
especially true if you'll have more than one stream running at a time.
</p><p>
I have an older i7 Intel box running eight cores at 3GHZ. It can transcode
3&ndash;4 1080p videos in real time without too much trouble. I'm running
Ubuntu Server without a monitor, but the program will happily run in the
background on your powerful workstation too. It doesn't have to have a
GUI open and simply will run as a service in the background.
</p><p>
If you pay for the Plex Pass subscription, you also
have the option to run plexmediaserver in the cloud at no additional
charge. I'm a lifetime subscriber to Plex Pass, so if I wanted to
offload all the transcoding to the Plex servers, I could do that. The
only problem with running Plex in the cloud is you have to store all your
media in Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive (Figure 1). Since that
storage isn't free, you still end up paying. The upside is transcoding
will work without the need to buy a powerful server. It's certainly an
easy way to try Plex.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f1.large.jpg"><img src="12207f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Cloud storage is great, but it can become expensive when it's counted 
in terabytes.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x275a930"></a>
Installing and Updating</h2></div></div><p>
Since the plexmediaserver is proprietary,
you'll have to download the binary from the website:
<a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads" target="_self">https://www.plex.tv/downloads</a>. Downloads are available for a wide
variety of platforms, as you can see in Figure 2. When you log in to the
web interface to watch videos or configure the server, it will tell
you whether the software needs to be updated. Thankfully, on a Linux server,
there's an even easier way to keep things up to date.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f2.large.jpg"><img src="12207f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Over on GitHub, user mrworf has created an automated bash script that
will download and install the newest version of plexmediaserver. It even
supports logging in with a Plex Pass account, so you can get the latest
features without logging in to the website to download the installer. Check
out <a href="https://github.com/mrworf/plexupdate" target="_self">https://github.com/mrworf/plexupdate</a> for a one-liner install that will
configure your server to download and install new server
software as it's released automatically. With the need for authenticated downloads for
Plex Pass users, it used to be difficult to automate the process. Thanks
to mrworf, that's no longer a problem!
</p><p>
Once you have the server installed, open a web browser and connect to
http://localhost:32400/web to configure. If you're running on a headless
server, you should be able to connect from another machine. Just go
to http://plex.server.ip:32400/web and configure it remotely. If the
server is listening only on localhost, you might have to do something
like an SSH tunnel for the initial configuration. On your GUI machine,
do something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -L 32400:localhost:32400 username@plex.server.ip
</pre>
</p><p>
Then on your GUI machine, you should be able to connect to
http://localhost:32400/web and actually be connected to the remote
server. SSH is awesome.
</p><p>
Once the initial setup is complete, your media folders will be added. Plex is
fairly flexible with naming formats, but basically, if you want your movies
and television shows to be tagged properly with metadata downloaded,
you need to name the files appropriately. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Beauty.and.the.Beast.1991.720p.brrip.mp4
Beauty.and.the.Beast.2017.1080p.brrip.mkv
Eureka.S01E09.Primal.480p.avi
The.Expanse.S01E09.Critical_Mass.720p.HDTV.mkv
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, Plex is flexible when it comes to section separators and
such. For movies, the important thing is to have the title and year,
and for television shows, the show name along with season/episode
information. Plex will search subfolders, so it's okay to keep your videos
organized in folders. For example, I have season folders for my shows.
</p><p>
To add a folder, simply click the + next to the library
section on the left. Then you must select the library type (Figure
3). The reason for selecting a type is that movies are scanned from
databases that are different from television shows or music databases. Also, Plex supports
photos and home movies, which aren't scanned for online metadata at
all. Once you add the folders to a particular library, Plex will scan
for content. Notice that a &ldquo;Library&rdquo; can have multiple
folders. This means if
you have several locations where you store movies or television shows, you can
add them all to the same section in Plex so you don't have &ldquo;TV Shows
1&rdquo;
and &ldquo;TV Shows 2&rdquo;. Plex just combines all the folders in the database
and presents the content as one.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f3.large.jpg"><img src="12207f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. It's a little confusing at first, but the library
&ldquo;type&rdquo; is for
better metadata.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x275b2d0"></a>
More Than Just Local Files</h2></div></div><p>
Normally, I rip Blu-ray disks manually and add them to the server, which
scans and adds them to the library. Recently, the folks at Plex have added DVR
and Live TV support. It's currently in beta and available only for Plex
Pass users, but the integration is nice.
</p><p>
The simplest way to implement the DVR system is by installing a supported
tuner. Some in-server tuners are supported, but I prefer
to use a network tuner like HDHomeRun. Whether you're using OTA broadcasts
or cable TV, if your tuner is supported, Plex can find guide data. Figure
4 shows the DVR setup, which is extremely simple.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f4.large.jpg"><img src="12207f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The HDHomeRun was detected on my network automatically.
</p></div></div><p>
Once configured, a new section called &ldquo;Program Guide&rdquo; appears in the left
column (Figure 5). Rather than showing a traditional programming grid,
Plex displays currently playing shows along with what will be starting
soon. It's a different television interface from what I'm used to, but with
the limited number of channels I receive OTA, it was tolerable. From
inside the guide, you either can tune in directly to watch live TV (on
supported devices, which at the time of this writing is mainly mobile devices)
or schedule a recording.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f5.large.jpg"><img src="12207f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The program guide takes a little getting used to, but it
certainly integrates well.
</p></div></div><p>
When a recording is scheduled, you're asked where to store the video. I
keep my recordings in a separate location from my ripped videos,
because I don't want to confuse recordings with commercial-free DVD
rips. Plex downloads metadata for recorded shows and puts them in your
library alongside other videos. I actually wish there was a way to tell
which videos were recordings and which were ripped, but right now, that
doesn't seem to be possible. Nevertheless, being able to watch live TV
from anywhere is awesome.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x275b900"></a>
Logs and Data and Stats, Oh My...</h2></div></div><p>
One area Plex is lacking is in the log department. That might seem
like a strange complaint, because there is an error log if something
goes wrong. But since I have a server and share access with a few friends,
I really like to know what my server is doing. My wife thinks it's creepy
that I have a log of everything everyone watches, but my concern is more
with how well my server performs with multiple streams and so forth.
Thankfully,
there's a third-party open-source project specifically for keeping
statistics about the Plex server. It's called PlexPy.
</p><p>
If you head over to <a href="https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy" target="_self">https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy</a>, there are
some simple instructions for installing PlexPy on your server alongside
plexmediaserver itself. Using git, it even has a smooth update feature so
you can just click a button in the web interface to upgrade. Installation
is simple, and although the directions say you must connect to localhost
in order to access the interface, my install was listening on all
interfaces by default. I was able to connect to
http://plex.server.ip:8181/.
</p><p>
That will take you to the initial setup, which will connect PlexPy to
your server. At first, the data is underwhelming, because PlexPy records
statistics itself as opposed to reading information from a log file. So when
you initially install it, there's no data to display. After a few days
(or hours, if you have a house full of teenagers), the statistics begin
showing more information.
</p><p>
Figure 6 shows my PlexPy dashboard. The data ranges
from interesting information (most popular movie) to vital server data (most
concurrent streams). I'm a bit of a data nerd, so drilling down into each
section is something I do on a regular basis. If you're not as interested
(or creepy) as me, PlexPy also has a robust notification system. Figure
7 shows the wide variety of notification agents available. I use the
IFTTT notification agent, so I get a quick ping on my phone when server
events take place. The notification settings can be tweaked to send
whatever information you desire. If you want to know every time someone
starts playing a video, you can do that. If you just want to be notified
if someone starts streaming multiple concurrent streams, you can set
that up too. That is of particular interest to me, because if one of my
friends suddenly starts streaming my server files to multiple locations,
it probably means that account was compromised. Before I got a fiber
connection to my office, I also was concerned about upload bandwidth. Now
I just want to know when concurrent streaming happens.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f6.large.jpg"><img src="12207f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. I love PlexPy. The sheer amount of data is delicious.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12207f7.large.jpg"><img src="12207f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Notifications are important, and the number of options is
wonderful.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x27527c0"></a>
How to Consume</h2></div></div><p>
I've written about this several times through the years,
but it makes sense to mention it here as well. Plex has a ton of client
options. The web browser interface is robust and available
anywhere simply by heading to <a href="https://plex.tv/web" target="_self">https://plex.tv/web</a> from any computer. Once
authenticated, you'll be connected to your personal server and be able
to configure it or watch videos.
</p><p>
There are mobile applications for Android and Apple as
well. Unfortunately, if you're not a Plex Pass subscriber, those apps cost
$5. The plexmediaserver does a great job of detecting bandwidth issues,
so if you're streaming over cell-phone internet, it can dial back the video
quality during transcode. Every time I'm on the road for work, I bring a
tablet along so I can watch movies and TV from my hotel room. Even with
horrible hotel internet, I generally can watch acceptable-quality video.
</p><p>
When it comes to consuming movies and television, however, the television
is still king. Quite a few smart televisions have Plex as an installable
application out of the box. Samsung smart TVs in particular do a great
job, and since Plex is a native app, there's no need for an extra
remote. My television brands vary, so native apps aren't always an
option. My favorite device for connecting to Plex is a Roku. I have a
Roku 4K television in my office, but the standalone Roku boxes work well
too. I like Roku because since it's not a streaming content provider,
it doesn't favor one application over another. That means Netflix, Hulu,
Amazon Video and Plex all are treated the same. And, Plex works very,
very well on every Roku device I've tried. Even a Roku Express, which is
installed in my Chevy Traverse, works well on long car trips.
</p><p>
If you're not interested in buying new hardware just to connect to a Plex
server, chances are you already own something with Plex support. Most
modern video game platforms (Xbox, PlayStation) have Plex in the app
store. Even a Raspberry Pi works well, and there's a distribution
(<a href="http://www.rasplex.com" target="_self">www.rasplex.com</a>) designed to make a Pi the perfect client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x2752ad8"></a>
Perfection? Nothing Is.</h2></div></div><p>
As much as I love the Plex platform for media streaming, I'll admit, I
wish the plexmediaserver portion was open source. The development team
is admittedly very fair with the product and allows anyone to use a
significant number of features for free, but it's still not the same as
being open source. If that bothers you, Plex might not be something you
should check out, because if you do check it out, chances are you're going
to love how well it works, and then you'll have a tough decision to make.
</p><p>
I'm okay with supporting a proprietary project, especially when the developers
embrace the Open Source community and continue to contribute their code
on the front end to the FOSS world. Heck, I'm even willing to give
them money in the form of a lifetime Plex Pass subscription, because
I really like what they're doing. If you'd like to participate, I urge
you to head over to <a href="http://plex.tv" target="_self">plex.tv</a> and check it out. If nothing else,
every blog post comes with a picture of Barkley, the developer's dog.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2662580.0x2752c90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Plex Pass?</b></p><p>
Although Plex's roots are in the open-source Kodi project, those roots
are only as deep as the front-end portion of Plex is concerned. The
actual plexmediaserver code is not open source. It is freely available
to download, but it's important to understand the back end is not FOSS.
</p><p>
That being said, the front-end components are still GPL and will continue
to be available for download and contribution. Also, although the server
code is proprietary, the Plex team is open to integration like plugins and
so on. The separation is clear, and the Plex team isn't being
&ldquo;shady&rdquo;
about the GPL.
</p><p>
Since the server software is proprietary, the Plex team provides the option to
purchase a &ldquo;Plex Pass&rdquo;, which is a subscription that allows earlier access
to Plex features. Most features eventually make it to the free-to-download
version of plexmediaserver, but subscribers who financially support the
team get early access to features along with the ability to use Plex in
the cloud, sharing their libraries, DVR, Live TV and so on.
</p><p>
Many of the features I discuss in this article are available for Plex
Pass users only. To see what is available in the free version versus the
Premium, check out this page: <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass" target="_self">https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass</a>.
It's only $5 to try the features for a month, and if you enjoy it
half as much as I do, the lifetime subscription is more than worth it!
