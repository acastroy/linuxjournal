Find out what a good patch management system looks like and why you
shouldn't do it by hand.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb6580.0xcae408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A few articles ago, I started a Sysadmin 101 series to pass down some fundamental
knowledge about systems administration that the current generation of junior
sysadmins, DevOps engineers or &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; developers might not
learn otherwise.
I had thought that I was done with the series, but then the WannaCry
malware came out and exposed some of the poor patch management practices still
in place in Windows networks. I imagine some readers that are still stuck in
the Linux versus Windows wars of the 2000s might have even smiled with a sense
of superiority when they heard about this outbreak. 
</p><p>
The reason I decided to
revive my Sysadmin 101 series so soon is I realized that most Linux
system administrators are no different from Windows sysadmins when it comes to patch
management. Honestly, in some areas (in particular, uptime pride), some Linux
sysadmins are even worse than Windows sysadmins regarding patch management.
So in this
article, I cover some of the fundamentals of patch management
under Linux, including what a good patch management system looks like, the
tools
you will want to put in place and how the overall patching process should
work.

What Is Patch Management?</h2></div></div><p>
When I say patch management, I'm referring to the systems you have in place to
update software already on a server. I'm not just talking about keeping up with
the latest-and-greatest bleeding-edge version of a piece of
software. Even more
conservative distributions like Debian that stick with a particular version of
software for its &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release still release frequent updates that patch
bugs or security holes.
</p><p>
Of course, if your organization decided to roll its own version of a
particular piece of software, either because developers demanded the latest and
greatest, you needed to fork the software to apply a custom change, or you just
like giving yourself extra work, you now have a problem. Ideally you have put
in a system that automatically packages up the custom version of the software
for you in the same continuous integration system you use to build and package
any other software, but many sysadmins still rely on the outdated method of
packaging the software on their local machine based on (hopefully up to date)
documentation on their wiki. In either case, you will need to confirm that your
particular version has the security flaw, and if so, make sure that the new patch
applies cleanly to your custom version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb6580.0xcae880"></a>
What Good Patch Management Looks Like</h2></div></div><p>
Patch management starts with knowing that there is a software update to begin
with. First, for your core software, you should be subscribed to your Linux
distribution's security mailing list, so you're notified immediately when there
are security patches. If there you use any software that doesn't come from your
distribution, you must find out how to be kept up to date on security patches
for that software as well. When new security notifications come in, you should
review the details so you understand how severe the security flaw is, whether
you are affected and gauge a sense of how urgent the patch is.
</p><p>
Some organizations have a purely manual patch management system. With such a
system, when a security patch comes along, the sysadmin figures out which
servers are running the software, generally by relying on memory and by logging
in to servers and checking. Then the sysadmin uses the server's built-in package
management tool to update the software with the latest from the distribution.
Then the sysadmin moves on to the next server, and the next, until all of the servers are
patched.
</p><p>
There are many problems with manual patch management. First is the fact that it
makes patching a laborious chore. The more work patching is, the more likely a
sysadmin will put it off or skip doing it entirely. The second problem is that
manual patch management relies too much on the sysadmin's ability to remember
and recall all of the servers he or she is responsible for and keep track of which
are patched and which aren't. This makes it easy for servers to be forgotten
and sit unpatched.
</p><p>
The faster and easier patch management is, the more likely you are to do it.
You should have a system in place that quickly can tell you which servers are
running a particular piece of software at which version. Ideally, that system
also can push out updates. Personally, I prefer orchestration tools like
MCollective for this task, but Red Hat provides Satellite, and Canonical provides
Landscape as central tools that let you view software versions across your
fleet of servers and apply patches all from a central place.
</p><p>
Patching should be fault-tolerant as well. You should be able to patch a
service and restart it without any overall down time. The same idea goes for
kernel patches that require a reboot. My approach is to divide my servers into
different high availability groups so that lb1, app1, rabbitmq1 and db1 would
all be in one group, and lb2, app2, rabbitmq2 and db2 are in another. Then, I
know I can patch one group at a time without it causing downtime anywhere else.
</p><p>
So, how fast is fast? Your system should be able to roll out a patch to a minor
piece of software that doesn't have an accompanying service (such as bash in
the case of the ShellShock vulnerability) within a few minutes to an hour at
most. For something like OpenSSL that requires you to restart services, the
careful process of patching and restarting services in a fault-tolerant way
probably will take more time, but this is where orchestration tools come in
handy. I gave examples of how to use MCollective to accomplish this
in my recent MCollective articles (see the December 2016 and January 2017
issues), but ideally, you should put a system
in place that makes it easy to patch and restart services in a fault-tolerant
and automated way.
</p><p>
When patching requires a reboot, such as in the case of kernel patches, it
might take a bit more time, but again, automation and orchestration tools can
make this go much faster than you might imagine. I can patch and reboot the
servers in an environment in a fault-tolerant way within an hour or two, and it
would be much faster than that if I didn't need to wait for clusters to sync
back up in between reboots. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, many sysadmins still hold on to the outdated notion that uptime is
a badge of pride&mdash;given that serious kernel patches tend to come out at least once a
year if not more often, to me, it's proof you don't take security
seriously.
</p><p>
Many organizations also still have that single point of failure server that can
never go down, and as a result, it never gets patched or rebooted. If you want to
be secure, you need to remove these outdated liabilities and create systems
that at least can be rebooted during a late-night maintenance window.
</p><p>
Ultimately, fast and easy patch management is a sign of a mature and professional
sysadmin team. Updating software is something all sysadmins have to do as part
of their jobs, and investing time into systems that make that process easy and
fast pays dividends far beyond security. For one, it helps identify bad
architecture decisions that cause single points of failure. For another, it
helps identify stagnant, out-of-date legacy systems in an environment and
provides you with an incentive to replace them. Finally, when patching is managed
well, it frees up sysadmins' time and turns their attention to the things that truly require
their expertise.
