Remote backups aren't even remotely optional. Do it!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2331580.0x2429358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It still shocks me how many people don't keep backups of their
files. Every time people ask me to look at their computers (almost always
a malware-infected Windows machine), I ask them if they have backups
before I start poking around. Invariably, the answer is no. Sometimes
the computers even contain vital business data, and the closest thing
to a backup is a local copy of the database in the same folder as the
active copy. As someone who had a house burn down, I can tell you,
off-site backups aren't just for fancy government organizations!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2331580.0x2429510"></a>
Things That Aren't Backups</h2></div></div><p>
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks), as wonderful as it is, must not be mistaken as a
backup. Simply put, RAID is a
method for ensuring your single, local copy of data is less prone to
failure. And that's really only for RAID levels that create mirrors or
parity. Using RAID level 0, you're actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> likely to lose data
than by storing it on a single hard drive!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11987f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. RAID 5 is awesome, but trust me, it's not foolproof.
</p></div></div><p>
I personally learned the hard way that RAID is not the same as a
backup. I've been preaching it for years, but on my local NAS (Network
Attached Storage) device, I implemented RAID 6. Since that meant two drives
could fail and I still wouldn't lose data, I didn't bother backing
up my collection of videos, including irreplaceable home videos. As
luck(?) would have it, a power fluctuation during a storm caused three hard
drives in my array to fail at the same time, and I lost all 24TB of
storage. Most of the data I lost was just digital backups of our DVDs
and Blu-rays, but about 10GB of that data was home videos. And since
I didn't back it up, it's lost forever.
</p><p>
The moral of the story is this: RAID is awesome. You should use RAID if
possible to help prevent data loss resulting from failed hardware. But,
don't stop with RAID and assume your data is safe. It's not. Your data is
safe only if there is more than one copy of if. And, that's where actual
backup comes into play.

Live Mirrors</h2></div></div><p>
Live copies of your data is a backup of sorts. The great part about live
backups is in the name; they're live. The minute you create or change
a file, those changes are synced to your mirror. The problem with live
mirrors is that if you accidentally save over a file, or inadvertently
remove a file, those changes are synced and you lose all the copies of
the data in real time. Some options do automatic versioning of files,
which makes your data a little more secure, but for the most part, live
mirrors protect you from hardware failure, but not human error.
</p><p>
My favorite commercial software for live mirroring is Dropbox. It's
free for a small amount of storage (probably enough for a folder full
of office documents), and it does file revisioning, which helps for
accidental overwrites. Unfortunately, in order to back up a significant
amount of data, you have to pay annually for Dropbox storage. There
are other Dropbox-like solutions, such as SugarSync, Box, Google Drive and
so on. Most have a small amount of storage for free and allow extra
storage for a subscription fee.
</p><p>
If you have multiple computers, or a computer an a server, another
live mirror option is to use BitTorrent Sync. You can get
the free client at <a href="http://getsync.com" target="_self">getsync.com</a>, and install the software on
most platforms, including headless on a server. I've written about
BitTorrent Sync before. The beauty is that all the data is stored on
your own machines, so the only limit on space is how much storage you
have on your devices. 
</p><p>
I personally use BitTorrent Sync to keep a full,
live mirror of my wife's home directory on our home server. That way,
if she forgets her laptop at work, I can access any file for her, even
if her laptop is shut off. She can edit the files at home, and as soon
as she turns her laptop back on, BitTorrent Sync updates the files at
work. 
</p><p>
You can have as many mirrors as you want with Bittorrent Sync,
so we also have a &ldquo;Family&rdquo; folder that we sync between all our
computers. If we need to pass a file to a family member, we just drop it
in the Family folder and everyone instantly has access to it. The free
version of BitTorrent Sync does not do file versioning, so if you make a
change, the old version of your file is lost forever. That can be very
convenient, but it also can be very frustrating. That's why I consider
BitTorrent Sync vital, but I don't consider it a backup.

Backup Programs</h2></div></div><p>
There are two backup programs of which I'm particularly fond. I've written
about them both in the past, but I want to highlight them again here. The first
is BackupPC. It is a server-based program that creates true backups of
data and keeps multiple copies of files on a rotation. For example,
BackupPC will store a complete snapshot backup of every day of the week
and then delete the oldest backup daily when the full week is stored. It
also can be configured to keep a monthly or even annual backup snapshot as
well. The best part about BackupPC is that it uses hard linking to store
multiple copies of the same file without using any extra storage. The
only storage increase comes with new or changed files, meaning a server
can store vast numbers of &ldquo;full&rdquo; backups without wasting disk space.
</p><p>
Another great feature of BackupPC is that all backups are pulled from
the server rather than being pushed from the client. This can be
inconvenient for laptops that are shut off, but it means the server knows
(and notifies) if it can't connect to machines in its backup list. Plus,
it has an incredible Web interface that allows simple file restoration
directly to the original location or downloadable via ZIP file. I love
BackupPC, but it works well only over a LAN. If your house burns down,
that doesn't help much.
</p><p>
Another favorite of mine is CrashPlan. It's a commercial,
Java-based application that is so awesome, it's worth installing Java! CrashPlan
does have a commercial cloud-based service that will keep your data safe
on its servers. It's not free, but it is reasonable. The coolest part
of CrashPlan, however, is that it allows backing up from one client to
another&mdash;even from friend to friend. If you have friends who
are willing to
store your backups (offering to do the same for them often is a good motivator),
you can have automatic, off-site backups for no cost whatsoever. Files
can be restored fairly easily using the client software, and since
backups are completely encrypted, your friends don't have access to the
files they're storing for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11987f3.large.jpg"><img src="11987f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. CrashPlan is a commercial product, but it offers incredible
free functionality.
</p></div></div><p>
If you don't have a friend willing to store your data, it might be worth
it to ask someone to colocate a small server for you. For the cost of
a cheap Raspberry Pi and an external USB drive, you can have a remote
CrashPlan server logged in to your own account. It's even possible to
limit the bandwidth and time of day you use, so your friend's Internet
connection isn't adversely affected. Heck, if you can't find a friend,
you might be able to put a small server in an outdoor shed, assuming you
have Wi-Fi access and power. (It might be fun to create a solar-powered
backup box for the backyard&mdash;perhaps that will be a project in the
next couple months!)

Data Junkies, There's Hope!</h2></div></div><p>
I have a 48TB storage array in my basement. It's not full (yet), but
it has many terabytes of data just sitting there waiting for something
horrible to happen. And since it has happened to me before, I'm not
blindly trusting my RAID 6 array for protection. The problem is,
48TB of storage is expensive, and that much cloud storage is even more
expensive. I have a decent upload speed on my Internet connection, but
paying for a place to store it is costly. I think the best solution
would be to colocate a NAS device somewhere with fast bandwidth and a
static IP. Unfortunately, I can't afford anything like that.
</p><p>
The cheapest storage solution I can find is Amazon Cloud Drive
(<a href="http://amazon.com/clouddrive/unlimited" target="_self">amazon.com/clouddrive/unlimited</a>). It surprised me, honestly,
because although S3 storage is affordable, for large buckets, it's not exactly
cheap. At the time of this writing, however, it's possible to buy Amazon
Cloud Drive Unlimited for $60 per year. That might seem like a lot,
but $5 a month is pretty cheap to store multiple terabytes of storage.
</p><p>
Amazon Cloud Drive isn't exactly Linux-friendly, but there are command-line
tools for uploading files, and many sync programs support it. In my case,
the Synology NAS I use (Figure 4) has full support for Amazon Cloud Drive,
and it automatically mirrors my entire NAS. The unlimited storage appears
to be the real deal, and I haven't had any issues so far with reaching
limits. That said, I don't have 48TB stored yet, so it's possible I'll
be contacted as my storage allocation increases.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11987f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. My Synology 1815+ has eight drive bays populated with 6TB
drives. The software is amazing, and it includes cloud syncing to Amazon
Cloud Drive.

The Important Part</h2></div></div><p>
If you get nothing else from this article, please, make a backup
of your important data. Even if it's just a live mirror copy, having
your data in two places is so important in the increasingly digital world
we live in, you just can't ignore the need.
</p><p>
I'm also very interested in hearing other backup ideas. If you have an
affordable, free, innovative or unique way to back up files, please
send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> with
&ldquo;[BACKUP IDEA]&rdquo; in the subject line.
</p><p>
In the meantime, I'll work on that solar-powered backup box for the
backyard and be sure to write up a how-to so we can all sleep a little
better at night!
