Learning tmux can be daunting with all of its options and hotkeys. Here's what
you need to get up to speed quickly.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
tmux is one of those programs that seemed to have so many options and new
commands, I thought it wasn't worth learning. Not because it wouldn't be useful,
but because I assumed the learning curve would be too steep. Now that I've
finally dug in to it and made it a part of my work flow though, I can't imagine
going back to life without it, and I regret every time I thought about
learning it and didn't. tmux does have a lot of bells and whistles, but
knowing them isn't vital to its usefulness. In other words, you can do a
lot with just a little tmux knowledge and a good cheatsheet.
</p><p>
tmux (terminal multiplexer) functions like screen: you create a session and
do work inside it. At any time, you can detach the session, only to reattach
later and find everything set up exactly as you left it when you detached.
The feature of tmux that sets it apart from screen is the ability to split
your terminal window into multiple window panes and rearrange them on the
fly. Screen allows you to create multiple windows per session, but with
tmux, you then can split each window vertically or horizontally (or both)
and resize the panes on a whim. It's also trivial to swap panes around the
window and even rotate through a pre-selected set of pane groupings&mdash;like in a tiling window manager.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe724b8"></a>A Little Background</h2></div></div><p>
When I first started working in operations, I found I was in and out of
multiple SSH sessions to dozens of machines all day long. Pretty soon, I
started looking for a terminal emulator that could handle tabs and the 
functionality described above, and I found Terminator for Linux. 
</p><p>
When I
moved to a QA role in a startup, I was handed a MacBook, and the first thing
I did was find the OS X equivalent: iTerm2. That served me fairly well until
a fateful day working out of a coffee shop while getting my car repaired.
My current job involves launching anywhere between 5 and 50 cloud instances
at a time to test against. The coffee shop's Wi-Fi cut out so much that I
spent all day trying to launch a single set of instances and never got any
actual work done.
</p><p>
Once my car was finished and I made it home, I dug an old Raspberry Pi out
of a closet and set it up to launch instances from it. I would
<tt  >ssh</tt> in and open
screen, then launch instances to my heart's content. If my laptop's Wi-Fi
cut out, it didn't matter. My SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi would die,
but the instances were launching in screen, so the session wasn't lost; I
just couldn't see it. When the Wi-Fi came back, I'd
<tt  >ssh</tt> back in and reattach
to my screen session. This gave me the added bonus of being able to issue
the tear down command and sleep my laptop right away instead of waiting for
the instances to be destroyed. That meant I didn't have to budget an extra
20 minutes into the end of my day for waiting on instance clean up.
</p><p>
This scheme worked pretty well, but eventually I realized I also could move
my entire development environment to the Raspberry Pi, and it would mean
less context switching and shuffling files and config around. Moving my whole
setup to the Raspberry Pi was another big step in the right direction, but
I pretty quickly realized I was missing the multi-paned windows of iTerm2,
and screen's tabs just weren't enough. So I finally gave in and tried tmux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe727d0"></a>Getting Started with tmux</h2></div></div><p>
If tmux isn't already installed by default in your distribution, it's almost
certainly in your package manager (apt, yum and so on). After installation, tmux
will launch your first session. You should see what looks like your normal
prompt, but at the bottom of your terminal is the tmux status line. At the
far right of the status line is your hostname followed by the time and date. The
left side should show something like <tt  >[0] 0: bash*</tt>. The 0 in square brackets
<tt  >[0]</tt> is the session name. Knowing the session name is important if you
want to use more than one session and attach to the correct one, but that
won't be covered in this introduction. The rest of the text on the left is
the window list. Since you've just opened tmux for the first time, you have
only the default window (number 0), and it will be displaying the current running
program (bash, or your shell of choice, since it's idle). The asterisk
denotes the active window. It's worth noting that
<tt  >"hostname"</tt> in quotation marks on
the right side of the status bar is actually whatever the title of your
terminal is; hostname is just the default. So if you run something that
normally would change the name of your terminal window, that change will
now be reflected on the right in the tmux status line.
</p><p>
Pressing Ctrl-b is the magic keystroke to access tmux command mode. This is
similar to Ctrl-a in screen, with one big advantage: outside of screen,
typing Ctrl-a will move your cursor to the beginning of your pending command
string. Inside screen, you have to press Ctrl-a and then a again. Because
tmux uses Ctrl-b for commands, Ctrl-a still works like it does
outside of tmux.
</p><p>
To detach from your tmux session, press Ctrl-b, then press d for detach.
Attaching is the one area where screen has an edge on tmux. Screen has
flags that will attach an existing session if one exists and create one if
it doesn't (<tt  >screen -dRR</tt>), which means it can be easily aliased. Without
extra configuration, <tt  >tmux</tt> always will create a new session, and
<tt  >tmux attach</tt> will
attach only to an existing session. There is no &ldquo;attach or
create&rdquo;. One way
around this is <tt  >alias tm='tmux attach || tmux'</tt>
Running <tt  >tmux attach</tt> will
try to attach to your detached session and return 1 if it failed, because
there are no sessions, so <tt  >tmux attach || tmux</tt> will
try to re-attach and
create a new one if that failed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe72cf8"></a>Moving Around</h2></div></div><p>
After you've successfully created a tmux session, you'll want to start
opening windows and splitting them into multiple panes&mdash;the good stuff.
Create a new window with Ctrl-b, c. You'll see in your window list below
that you now have something like <tt  >[0] 0: bash 1:
bash*</tt>. The <tt  >1</tt> is now the active
window (so the asterisk moved). You can navigate through the list of
windows backward with Ctrl-b, p (for previous), forward Ctrl-b, n (for
next), and you can jump directly to a numbered window with Ctrl-b
followed by the number. So if you're still on window 1, pressing Ctrl-b, 0 will
move you back to window 0. 
</p><p>
If you have more than ten windows open, that
method won't work. Trying to do Ctrl-b, 10 will just put you on window 1 before
you can type 0. Once you have a double-digit number of windows open,
you'll want to use Ctrl-b, ', which prompts you for an index. Type the
number you want to go to, and when you press return, you'll go to that number,
so you can type 34 without being sent to window 3. 
</p><p>
Moving forward and
backward through your window list wraps, so if you have three windows open (0,
1, 2) and you're on two, pressing Ctrl-b, n will take you to window 0. And, then
Ctrl-b, p will take you from window 0 back to window 2. 
</p><p>
If you find
yourself going back and forth between two non-consecutive windows, rather
than remembering their numbers or shuffling through with n or p, use
Ctrl-b, l to swap back and forth. This will take you to your previous
window, kind of like how <tt  >cd -</tt> changes back and forth between two directories
on the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe73010"></a>Splitting Windows into Multiple Panes</h2></div></div><p>
Splitting windows into multiple panes is a similar process. To split a
window pane in half horizontally, press Ctrl-b, ". To split vertically,
press Ctrl-b, %. You can
keep splitting your screen beyond that too. Each time, the current pane
will be split in half leaving the rest of the panes as they were.
</p><p>
You can navigate
between panes with the arrow keys (after pressing Ctrl-b, of course). Or
you can cycle through all the panes with Ctrl-b, o. 
</p><p>
Knowing which pane
is &ldquo;next in line&rdquo; can be tricky with lots of panes in lots of different
sizes. To find out how the panes are numbered (and which pane will be active
next with Ctrl-b, o), use Ctrl-b, q to display an index in each of
the active window's panes. 
</p><p>
Finally, to swap back and forth between panes,
Ctrl-b, ; works with panes like Ctrl-b, l does with windows as
described above.
</p><p>
One minor disadvantage of tmux (and screen) is the inability to scroll
up through your terminal history with a scroll bar. But, you still
can scroll back, just press Ctrl-b, [ first. Then you can navigate up the screen
with the arrow keys. This is actually copy mode. tmux has its own
copy/paste buffers, which are active across the session, so you can copy
from one pane into another (or into another window).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe73328"></a>Copy Mode</h2></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, this is where tmux gets a little funky. tmux has two
different sets of keys to perform the same operations: one that emulates
emacs, and the other emulates vi. Describing all of the different
operations and their emacs and vi bindings is beyond the scope of this
introduction; see the manual
page for details. What is important is that the way you highlight text is
different depending on the mode. The default mode is emacs. You can change
that
in a number of ways, but worth mentioning here is by your VISUAL
and/or EDITOR environment variables, because it can change the bindings
without you expressly making the change yourself. If either of those
contain vi (for example, vi or vim), tmux will set your mode to vi.
</p><p>
Once you're in copy mode (by pressing Ctrl-b, [), press the spacebar, and then use the
arrow keys to move your cursor around. If the text is highlighted, you
are in vi mode. If not, navigate back to what you want to copy and use
Ctrl-spacebar to start highlighting instead. After using the arrow keys
(or emacs or vi shortcuts) to highlight the text you want to copy, use
spacebar or Ctrl-spacebar again to copy the highlighted text into the
buffer and exit copy mode. Now use the keys described above to navigate to
the window and pane you want to paste into, and use Ctrl-b, ] to paste.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe734e0"></a>Resizing and Rearranging</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have your window panes all split up, you may find you want to
resize or rearrange them. This process is also slightly more complicated,
but it's not as confusing as copy mode's multiple key combination stuff.
Resizing can be done by one- or five-line increments. To change a panel's size by
one line, use Ctrl-b then Ctrl-arrow key, which will expand or
contract the pane (depending on the orientation) in the direction of the
arrow key. This also will have the opposite effect on the adjacent pane.
tmux has no control over the size of the whole window; that is up to your
window manager. If you expand one pane, the adjacent pane must shrink.
To resize by five-line increments, the process is identical, except instead of
Ctrl-arrow key, press Ctrl-b, Alt-arrow key.
</p><p>
Rearranging panes is also possible. If you have a layout you like but want
some panes swapped around, use Ctrl-b, { or Ctrl-b, } to swap the
current pane with the previous or next pane. (Press Ctrl-b, q to see the pane
indices, so you know which pane will be swapped with the current pane.) 
</p><p>
To
change your pane layout completely, reshaping and redrawing all of the
panes, use Ctrl-b, spacebar to rotate through five different layout
presets: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Even-horizontal: all panes in even columns.
</p></li><li><p>
Even-vertical: all panes in even rows.
</p></li><li><p>
Main-horizontal: one big row on top with the rest
of the panes in columns underneath.
</p></li><li><p>
Main-vertical: one big column on
the left with the remaining panes in rows on the right.
</p></li><li><p>
Tiled:
all panes in even rectangles.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
According to the manual page,
you also can use Ctrl-b, Alt-[1-5] in order to rearrange the
panes directly in the style described above, respectively, without cycling through
the others. For whatever reason, I was unable to get that to work, but your
mileage may vary. 
</p><p>
If you find that you have one pane you just can't
fit into your current window the way you like, there's also an option to
break it out. Pressing Ctrl-b, ! will remove the current pane from the current
window and move it to a new window of its own.
</p><p>
Rearranging whole windows is much simpler. Pressing Ctrl-b, . will prompt for a
new index for the current window. You must provide an index that is not
already in use. This will rearrange the windows so that the window you
re-indexed now will be in the correct spot when cycling through windows
with Ctrl-b, n or Ctrl-b, p. 
</p><p>
On the face of it, this would suggest
that you can re-index windows only at the end of the current list, but that
isn't strictly true. When you close a window, the existing windows are not
reordered. So if you have windows 0, 1, 2, 3, and you were to close window
1,
you then would have 0, 2, 3. Windows 2 and 3 do not shift down to fill in
the gap. So, pressing Ctrl-b, . would re-index any of those windows as
window 1. 
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that when you create a new window, the
first missing index is used rather than adding on to the end. Using the
same example, if you have windows 0, 2, 3 and you use Ctrl-b, c to create
a new window, you will end up with 0, 1, 2, 3 again, not 0, 2, 3, 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0xe73c70"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This should be more than enough to get you started with tmux. There's
plenty more functionality to explore in the man page, such as rebinding keys,
customizing your status line, even broadcasting your keystrokes to all the
visible window panes instead of just the active one. You also can make tmux
config files to automate setting up your tmux environment. You can define a
set of windows and panes to be opened and arranged automatically when you
start a new session. You even can tell tmux to run a command inside a pane
automatically when the session starts! 
</p><p>
But, don't be intimidated by all
those bells and whistles like I was. You can get a lot of benefit out of
tmux, even if all you do is open a couple windows and split them into two
panes on occasion. The man page has a reasonably good list of hotkeys, but
they aren't in any order that I could make sense of, so I made a chart (see
the tmux Cheatsheet sidebar),
which should help get you started with the basics described in this
article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd7a580.0x126c020"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Advanced Topic&mdash;SSH and tmux</b></p><p>
There is one advanced topic worth mentioning, since it's beyond the scope
of the manual page and took some Internet sleuthing (Duck Duck Go and
Stack Overflow) for me to figure out: <tt  >ssh</tt>-ing directly to tmux. My primary
use of tmux is on my remote development machine. I am sufficiently lazy
that opening a new terminal window, <tt  >ssh</tt>-ing to my dev box, then trying to
figure out if I already have a tmux session going and either attaching to
it or creating a new one is all just too much work. The alias I described
above would take care of the &ldquo;create new session&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;attach to existing
session&rdquo; problem. But I can do one better: automatically create or re-attach
when SSH connects. 
</p><p>
There actually are several ways to approach this, each with pros and cons.
The most obvious to me was to set tmux as my shell, using
<tt  >chsh</tt> or editing
/etc/passwd. Any relatively up-to-date distribution and tmux version should Just
Work. tmux does have a flag for running correctly as a shell in older
versions (see the man page). The problem with this approach is that without a
custom tmux config file, you are connected to a new session. Pressing
Ctrl-b, s will show you a menu of sessions and allow you to use arrow keys and enter
to select the old session you detached from, but then you have to deal with
cleaning up your new session(s), which involves entering tmux commands
after using Ctrl-b, : to access the tmux shell (again, see the man page).
</p><p>
You also could invoke tmux inside your .bashrc (or the equivalent in your
shell of choice), but you have to add checks to make sure you aren't
already in tmux, or you could end up in a loop. Your shell launches tmux,
which launches a shell, which runs your .bashrc again launching another
tmux, and so on. This option seemed sufficiently dangerous to me that I didn't
even try it, although I was able to find information about other people
doing it.
</p><p>
In the end, the option I chose was to edit my SSH authorized_keys file.
This is probably considered a bit of a hack. The authorized_keys file has
an option for restricting access to certain commands by adding
<tt  >command=...</tt> before the start of the key. I think this is how GitHub
allows SSH access for git but not shell access, for example. 
</p><p>
This has a
downside as well. Because it's a restriction, if you have more than one SSH
key in the authorized_keys, and you're coming from a machine with more than
one of those keys, SSH is going to use the one that is the least
restricted. 
</p><p>
In my case, I generated a new key to connect from my work
laptop to my Raspberry Pi dev box. I left the original key in place on the
Raspberry Pi and added the new one with <tt  >command="tmux attach ||
tmux"</tt>
prepended. When I tried to <tt  >ssh</tt> in, even when I specified the identity file
that was restricted, SSH would use the original, unrestricted key (without
<tt  >command=</tt>, etc., in it), and I would get a normal shell, not a tmux session.
I resolved this by removing all other authorized keys from the machine. I
suppose I also could have added a different user with only that new and
restricted authorized key or removed the other private key from my work
laptop, but removing the other key seemed like the easiest solution at the
time.
