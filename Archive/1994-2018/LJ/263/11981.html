<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #263, March 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Sometimes it's necessary to change function semantics inside the kernel,
and then find and update all users of that function to match the new
semantics. Such changes can result in huge patches going into the source
tree, affecting hundreds of files.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> wanted to do a change like that to a bunch of memory handling
routines. He'd noticed that the existing memory allocation tools all
returned plain numbers that users then would have to convert to
pointers in the vast majority of cases. Al posted a mega-whopper patch,
making those functions all return pointers instead of plain numbers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> didn't like it though. One of the problems with those
immense semantic-changing patches, he said, was that back-porting other
unrelated patches became more difficult. For each patch that needed to be
backported&mdash;security fixes, new drivers and so on&mdash;Linus said the port
would need to be reworked significantly just in order to get across the
barrier of Al's changes. That would be time-consuming for the developer,
would increase the likelihood of new bugs, and it didn't seem to carry enough
value to justify it.
</p><p>
The way to go about it, Linus said, was to create all new functions, with
new names, with the new semantics, and let the various parts of the kernel
switch over to the new calls as they pleased. But, even that seemed hard to
justify to him.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Al dropped his big patch and posted a new set of guidelines for
memory allocation that would help users resolve questions of which
functions to use in which circumstance:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
1) Most of the time kmalloc() is the right thing to use. Limitations:
alignment is no better than word, not available very early in bootstrap,
allocated memory is physically contiguous, so large allocations are best
avoided.
</p><p>
2) kmem_cache_alloc() allows to specify the alignment at cache creation
time. Otherwise it's similar to kmalloc(). Normally it's used for
situations where we have a lot of instances of some type and want dynamic
allocation of those.
</p><p>
3) vmalloc() is for large allocations. They will be page-aligned, but
*not* physically contiguous. OTOH, large physically contiguous allocations
are generally a bad idea. Unlike other allocators, there's no variant that
could be used in interrupt; freeing is possible there, but allocation is
not. Note that non-blocking variant *does* exist - __vmalloc(size,
GFP_ATOMIC, PAGE_KERNEL) can be used in atomic contexts; it's the interrupt
ones that are no-go.
</p><p>
4) If it's very early in bootstrap, alloc_bootmem() and friends may be the
only option. Rule of the thumb: if it's already printed 'Memory:
...../..... available.....' you shouldn't be using that one. Allocations
are physically contiguous and at that point large physically contiguous
allocations are still OK.
</p><p>
5) if you need to allocate memory for DMA, use dma_alloc_coherent() and
friends. They'll give you both the virtual address for your use and DMA
address referring to the same memory for use by device; do *NOT* try to
derive the latter from the former; use of virt_to_bus() et.al. is a Bloody
Bad Idea(tm).
</p><p>
6) If you need a reference to struct page, use alloc_page/alloc_pages.
</p><p>
7) In some cases (page tables, for the most obvious example),
__get_free_page() and friends might be the right answer. In principle,
it's case (6), but it returns page_address(page) instead of the page
itself. Historically that was the first API introduced, so a _lot_ of
places that should've been using something else ended up using that. Do
not assume that being lower level makes it faster than e.g. kmalloc() -
this is simply not true.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
System calls notoriously have insufficient error reporting. Some take lots
of inputs, and if any of them are wrong in any way, or fail some obscure
bounds check, the call returns &ldquo;EINVAL&rdquo; for invalid data, but doesn't give
any other clue about which piece of data had the problem, or what the value
was, or where in the code the problem occurred.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Shishkin</b></span> recently tried to implement a solution to this. The real
issue though is that the kernel can't simply change the way system calls
handle return values. There's code all through the kernel and in userland
that depends upon the current behavior. Any solution, therefore, would
somehow have
to provide additional reporting information, without changing the
way existing calling routines received syscall return values.
</p><p>
Alexander's technique took advantage of the fact that system calls 
generally were processed through a set of macros before sending their return
values back to the calling routines. By designing an entirely new set of
return values for the actual system calls, Alexander's code could reference
an error message holding tank that the macros would be able to process
while still returning the originally intended error code to the calling
routine.
</p><p>
The macros would place a pointer to the detailed error reports, in JSON
format, into the task_struct data structure, where it could be retrieved by
the calling routines, using a prctl() call.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Corbet</b></span>, however, had strong doubts about this approach. For one
thing, if the calling routine didn't actively query and reset the new
debugging data, that data would just sit in the task_struct, getting stale.
Although clearing out the debugging data automatically would defeat the
purpose of placing it there originally.
</p><p>
And, <span   class="bold"><b>Johannes Berg</b></span> also pointed out that with Alexander's changes in effect,
applications could break if they had to run on older kernels and expected
the new debugging data to be available.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Alexander's approach was not adopted, although no better idea
emerged. It's a thorny and persistent problem. It's not clear that any
solution will be able to answer all objections, but maybe something will be
able to answer more objections than the status quo.
</p><p>
There's a <span   class="bold"><b>Y2038</b></span> bug in Linux. It's the day when the 32-bit UNIX timestamp
rolls back to zero. Since Linux basically runs the known universe these
days, the bug has to be dealt with, probably by updating the timestamp to
hold a 64-bit value. <span   class="bold"><b>Deepa Dinamani</b></span> posted some patches to do that, but the
problem didn't end there.
</p><p>
The solution had to account for a wide range of possibilities. For example,
each different filesystem (NFS, ext4, FUSE and so on) needed its own
hand-crafted Y2038 bugfix. It wasn't the kernel alone that needed the fix.
Also, after the year 2038, even if all the filesystems had their own
fixes, how would a user be able to mount an older filesystem instance that
did not have the fix in place? That needed to be solved as well.
Additionally, there were corporate interests to consider. Certain service
contracts would require a Y2038 fix to be in place, perhaps decades before
the bug actually would hit.
</p><p>
Overall, it's going to be a lot of work. <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd
Bergmann</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Chinner</b></span> and
Deepa had a long technical conversation about the ins and outs, but the
clearest sense of direction to emerge from the discussion was that they
should ignore everything that wasn't directly relevant, and they should hew
off as many smaller chunks to solve as they possibly could in the hopes
that the main chunk might get easier and more manageable.

One thing I truly miss about the &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; way of reading the newspaper
is that I don't get to read the funny pages. No, that's not all I would
read (although admittedly it may have been the first page I turned to),
but a little levity always makes the day better. I'm not a big fan of
graphic novels or even comic books, but the daily funny pages are just
my speed.

Whether you love them or hate them, the GoComics Web site is full of new
and old comics alike (<a href="http://www.gocomics.com" target="_self">www.gocomics.com</a>). 
The GoComics app for Android is a free way
to consume those daily comic strips whether they're new or decades
old. My personal favorite comic of all times is Garfield (shown in the
screenshot). I collect Garfield memorabilia, Garfield books, and as a kid,
I even had Garfield sheets and curtains in my room. Anyway, thanks to the
GoComics app, I'm able to read decades of Garfield comics at my leisure,
and see the latest strips as well. 
</p><p>
If it weren't for GoComics, I'd have
to wait to buy the books every year for my daily dose of fuzzy fun. Get
the free version in the Google Play Store, or pay an annual fee of about a
buck a month to get the ad-free version. Either way, it's a wonderful way
to spend a few minutes every day (or an entire afternoon binge session).

For Linux users, scripting user installation is fairly simple. It's
possible, but not quite as simple with OS X. Thanks to Per Olofsson, it's
possible to distribute user accounts as installable packages that are as
simple as a double-click to install.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11981fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Managing user accounts is something all sysadmins have to do, and with
CreateUserPkg, it's simple to install and distribute. It also includes the
ability to create auto-login users, which is convenient, but it does add
security concerns since the password can't be encrypted in the PKG file if
it's going to be activated as an automatically logged in account. Like all
powerful tools, this one can be dangerous, so use only as appropriate!

My last full-time job was manager of a university's database
department. Ironically, I know very, very little about databases
themselves. I'm no longer in charge of college databases, but I still
do have a handful of MySQL servers that run my various Web applications. Apart
from <tt  >apt-get install</tt>, I have no idea how to make databases work.
Thankfully, help is available.

MySQLTuner is a Perl script that checks your local (or remote) MySQL server
and gives recommendations for improving security and performance. It does
not edit files or actually make changes to the server, but it does give a
very lengthy list of recommendations. If you (like me) are the sort of
person who just tends to copy/paste database setup instructions, running
MySQLTuner is a really good idea.
</p><p>
You can download your copy at <a href="http://mysqltuner.com" target="_self">mysqltuner.com</a>. Be sure to read the
documentation to get the most use out of the program. And, if you discover
security problems like the ones shown in my screenshot? Fix them!
</p><p>
Thanks to its ability to help improve and secure MySQL servers that 
otherwise might be vulnerable, MySQLTuner gets this month's Editors' Choice
award. If you're imperfect like me, download a copy today and fine-tune
your databases!

I've mentioned many times before the questionable nature of downloading
video game ROMs in order to emulate them on your computer. (Heck, my very
first article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was a description on how I built a MAME
cabinet!) Although I have some emulation tricks up my sleeve for future
issues, here I thought I'd mention the vast number of Flash-based
emulators available on the Internet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981ninf1.large.jpg"><img src="11981ninf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Some sites are more ad-laden than others, but many of them work quite well.
For example, for old-school Nintendo games, check out
<a href="http://www.nintendoemulator.com" target="_self">www.nintendoemulator.com</a> for a huge list of fully functional games.
I played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Brothers</em></span> on my laptop using Chrome's built-in Flash
and wasted a great deal of time doing so! 
</p><p>
As with downloading and emulating
ROMs locally, you should be aware of potential legal and moral issues. I
actually own so many old games that I don't have any moral problem playing
with emulators, but I'm not the ultimate authority. If you want to try out
some on-line emulators, either search Google for a few options, or visit the site
mentioned above. It's a great way to spend a boring afternoon!

<h2 class="title">Symbolic Math on Android</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #263, March 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For this article, I'm returning to portable science software
on Android. In a previous article, I looked at a program called
xcas/giac. This program is an open-source engine that is used to handle
symbolic manipulation of mathematical equations. Because it is open
source, it has been ported to several different platforms. Because
Android's core 
is really Linux, a port to the Android platform has been
made, and it's available on the Google Play store. Installation is as easy
as a quick search on the store and clicking install.
</p><p>
When you first start Xcas Pad, it asks you to enable the keyboard
included with the application. It takes you to the Language and Input
section of the settings so you can activate the keyboard. When you
finish, click the back button and go back to Xcas
Pad's main screen. The main screen has four tabs along the top where
you can access the main worksheet, a help screen, a plotter screen and a
session pane. At the bottom of the xcas pane is an entry line where you
can enter the individual xcas commands. The output from each command is
displayed in the main portion of the xcas pane. As an example, you can
find the derivative of the equation x<sup  >3</sup>&ndash;x
with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
diff(x^3-x)
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981xcasf1.large.jpg"><img src="11981xcasf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The main screen is a worksheet where you can start
working right away.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you enter the equation, you either can tap the done button
on the keyboard, or if you tap the back button, you also can tap the
enter button at the far right side of the entry line. You then
will see a pretty-printed version of your command entry and the results line
immediately below it (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981xcasf2.large.jpg"><img src="11981xcasf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The commands and results are displayed in pretty print
on the main panel.
</p></div></div><p>
If you tap on the entered command
in the display pane, it will be copied and pasted into the entry line,
ready for you to edit. You also can tap on the result line to get it
copied and pasted into the entry line so you can use it in the next
step of your calculation. This is very useful, especially when you are
doing discovery-level work.
</p><p>
Xcas is a very large system, however, with many different commands. Part
of the problem is trying to find exactly the command you need to
use. Tapping on the Help tab at the top of the screen brings up the
help pages available within Xcas Pad. At the top, you can enter a search
string to narrow the list a bit. You can find a description of the above
example command by searching for the string &ldquo;diff&rdquo;. Tapping the entry for
&ldquo;diff&rdquo; pulls up a help page with a short description, a list of examples,
related commands and the arguments for the command.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981xcasf3.large.jpg"><img src="11981xcasf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Help information is available for the commands within
Xcas Pad.
</p></div></div><p>
At the very top of the help page is a list of command names that are
aliases and equivalent to each other. Tapping on one of them enters that
command name into the entry line of the main worksheet tab. 
</p><p>
The list
of examples is especially useful. You can tap on one of the examples
available, and it will be copied into the entry line of the main worksheet
tab. This is a good way to get a starting point for some calculation that
you need to do, leaving you with just having to do some edits before
you are doing useful work. 
</p><p>
One thing to remember is that Xcas Pad is
like most other symbolic mathematical programs that are used in that
the commands are run sequentially. This means if you want to rerun
an earlier command, it will be rerun again based on the current state
of the engine. This might be different from one run to another based on
what you have been doing between the two runs. For example, you may have
rewritten a function that is used within the command in question.
</p><p>
You also can do plotting within Xcas Pad. Doing a search for
&ldquo;plot&rdquo;
in the help page will bring up a rather large number of available
commands. Scrolling down to the command plot and tapping it will give
you a list of simple examples for basic plots to see what the plots can
look like. Entering the following example gives the plot shown in Figure 4.

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot(x-1/6*x^3,x)
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981xcasf4.large.jpg"><img src="11981xcasf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Executing a plot command pops open the plotter tab.
</p></div></div><p>
Plots also are pretty-printed
and look fairly nice. If you just accept the defaults, you will get bare axes with no
labels. Unfortunately, there is not as much customizability available
as there is with the desktop versions, so you are kind of stuck with just
creating and looking at basic plots. This still can be extremely useful
when you are trying to figure out what a particular equation is doing.
</p><p>
Let's say you've been working on some problem for the last hour and want
to save your work. These worksheets are called sessions within Xcas
Pad. In order to save your current worksheet, you need to tap the option
button in the top right corner to get a pull-down menu. From this menu,
tapping the entry Save Session brings up a new window where you
can enter a filename to use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11981xcasf5.large.jpg"><img src="11981xcasf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The save session window allows you to enter a filename on your Android device.
</p></div></div><p>
There is a check box where you can select whether you also want
to save off the results along with the commands from your worksheet. You
can reload these saved sessions from the session tab. When you click
on it, it gives you a file and directory listing for the default
&ldquo;home&rdquo;
directory on your Android. Any sessions you saved from Xcas Pad will be
in the xcaspad sub-directory. You also can copy over other xcas-saved
files from work you may have done on your desktop. 
</p><p>
When you select
one of these session-saved files, you only have the option of running it
as a script. This is one major deficiency right now. If you want to make
changes to a file before running it, you need to open the session
file in a text editor first and make your edits there. Then you can
open and run it within Xcas Pad. There are many very good text editors
available on Android, so that shouldn't be a blocking problem.
</p><p>
Now you have another tool to help you get some heavy-duty
science done on the go. With just your phone or tablet, you can work on
your next big idea wherever you like. And if you use a file sharing service,
such as Dropbox or Google Drive, you simply can pick up your work from the
office wherever you have a few minutes to spare.
