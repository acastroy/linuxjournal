Wondering if your Rails application is running at peak efficiency? Before

I am writing this article in mid-May 2008, several weeks after Twitter was
rumored to be moving to a platform other than Ruby on Rails. Twitter,
of course, is an extremely popular service that allows users to
write updates and notes about their current status&mdash;and allows
readers to follow any number of people's Twitter feeds. You can think
of Twitter as a combination blogging and RSS platform, populated by
people who express themselves with only 140 characters at a time.
</p><p>
Like many other runaway Internet successes, Twitter appears to have
become too popular for its own good. This has led to some outages,
most notably one at the beginning of 2008 that took more than a day to
restore. Thus, it was seen as more than a mere coincidence when
Twitter's main architect left the company, and that within a few days,
the TechCrunch blog was quoting anonymous officials within Twitter
about how the service would be transitioning away from Ruby on Rails.
</p><p>
This was followed by a great deal of discussion over whether Rails is
a &ldquo;scalable&rdquo; architecture. Scalable used to mean that it was
possible to scale up applications using a Web site, almost regardless
of how many people are using it. But today, a scalable architecture
is one that's lean and mean, handling as many users as
possible with as few servers as possible. PHP, Java and .NET are
pretty universally considered to be scalable in this sense. Although even
the most efficient PHP application can handle only a finite number of
simultaneous users, it's undeniable that Ruby is a slower language
than PHP, and that the Rails framework adds some more overhead.
</p><p>
Of course, it's one thing to say that Rails doesn't scale as quickly
as PHP, and another to say that it doesn't scale at all. And, there
are other arguments to be made, including the fact that programmers
cost more than servers, and that programmer productivity should be at
least as significant a factor as scalability.
</p><p>
That said, it's easy for a Rails application to become slow. So, it is
nice to know that a variety of utilities can be
used to profile Rails applications&mdash;meaning, finding out exactly which
portion of the program is taking a long time to execute. This month,
we look at some techniques for profiling Rails applications.
Although such profiling doesn't make the software run any faster, it can
help identify the slowest parts of an application.

Profiling Pages</h2></div></div><p>
If you aren't happy with the performance of your Web site&mdash;and quite
frankly, you always should be concerned about the performance, trying
to give it a boost wherever possible&mdash;the first question to ask
is, &ldquo;Where are people spending their time?&rdquo; After all, if there are
100 different pages on your site, it doesn't really matter whether
page 35 is really slow if no one ever visits it.
</p><p>
The first tool to examine, the production log analyzer, is
designed to look at the Rails production log and produce some
basic statistics about it. The production log, as well as the
development and test logs, are typically stored in the log directory
under the Rails project root. Thus, on a production server, the log
is in log/production.log. This logfile is not 
rotated or modified automatically; there are clearly a number of ways to do that
using cron and other UNIX command-line tools.
</p><p>
The thing is, there already is a facility on UNIX (and Linux) systems
for handling logfiles, including their periodic rotation and disposal.
This facility is known as syslog, which makes it possible to send
logging information to a variety of different files based on
priorities and source materials. The /var/log directory on my Ubuntu
server is full of different logfiles, and nearly all of them were
created and written to by syslog.
</p><p>
It turns out that we can use syslog for our Rails
production logs.
Once we have done that&mdash;and yes, we must use syslog for this to
work&mdash;we then can analyze our production logs, learning exactly how much
time people have spent in our Rails application.
</p><p>
To move your Rails production log to syslog, you need to do several
things. First, you must install the Ruby gem that provides this
behavior:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install --remote SyslogLogger
</pre>
</p><p>
This installs the gem in the appropriate place on your system; on
mine, it was put into /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gem. Next, you need
to add the following to one or more of your environment
configuration files (either environment.rb or one or more files in
environments/*.rb) for your Rails system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'syslog_logger'
RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER = SyslogLogger.new
</pre>
</p><p>
This, of course, loads the syslog_logger gem and sets the default
logger to a new instance of SyslogLogger.
</p><p>
Now that you have told Rails to use syslog, you must tell syslog what to
do with the files that come from Rails. I opened /etc/syslog.conf
and added the following lines to the bottom:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*.info             /var/log/production.log
</pre>
</p><p>
And yes, the documentation system says that you can use a !rails tag
before this line, or one like it, to restrict logging to messages
coming from Rails. Unfortunately, this syntax does not appear to be
supported by Linux. So, this means production.log will include
messages from other programs and facilities, not just Rails. That
shouldn't concern us right now, although it might be an issue on a
busy machine with many services in active use.
</p><p>
Once you have modified syslog.conf in this way, you can restart
syslog.conf. Almost immediately, your production log should be stored
to /var/log/production.log. You can check this, of course, with the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /var/log/production.log
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this logfile is similar in many ways to the logfile you just
eliminated from the log directory in your application root.
However, it is formatted in such a way that the production log
analyzer will be able to find and perform calculations based on its
output. To analyze the logfile, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pl_analyze /var/log/production_log
</pre>
</p><p>
If you prefer to have the results sent to you via e-mail, rather than stored
to a disk file, use the -e option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pl_analyze /var/log/production_log -e reuven@lerner.co.il
</pre>
</p><p>
This option is particularly useful when you invoke pl_analyze from a
cron job, for example.
</p><p>
The output file from pl_analyze is divided into three parts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Time spent in each request.
</p></li><li><p>
Time spent in the database for each request.
</p></li><li><p>
Time spent rendering the output from each request.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For each controller action, pl_request lists how many times it was
invoked, as well as the average time it took to execute. It also
gives the min, max and standard deviation, allowing you to see how
much the execution time varied over time.
</p><p>
Thus, the production log analyzer shows which actions take
the greatest amount of time overall, which take the greatest amount of
time in the database (or to render) and how many times each was
invoked.
</p><p>
I have found pl_analyzer to be an indispensable tool when trying to
determine whether a site is fast enough and where I should
focus my attention to improve its speed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x285f580.0x29582d0"></a>
Request Profiler</h2></div></div><p>
The production log profiler shows which actions require attention,
but it doesn't tell why a particular action might be giving you
trouble. For that, you need to dive into the application a bit more,
profiling not a set of actions, but one particular action.
</p><p>
This is possible thanks to a built-in script that comes with Rails,
script/performance/request. This script follows a set of instructions
written in a (presumably short) Ruby program, using a similar set of
commands and subroutines that are available for integration tests.
</p><p>
In other words, you use integration-test syntax to describe a short
sequence of one or more actions and run this program via the
request profiler. Then, the request profiler produces two output files
that describe what was going on behind the scenes as those requests
were serviced. This information can help you improve the
performance of this particular action.
</p><p>
In order for this script to work, first install the ruby-prof
gem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install --remote ruby-prof
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that is installed, you need to create a simple integration test
script. This script doesn't need to be wrapped in the same object that
the integration tests themselves use. Instead, simply create a file
named test.rb, and put it somewhere on the filesystem. I created
a directory named test/performance and put it there, with the
one-line contents as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get('/')
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I'm using URLs here, rather than names of controllers
and actions. Finally, with this in place, invoke the profiler:


<pre     class="programlisting">
script/performance/request -n 10 test/performance/test.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you should see the program telling you that it's warming up
and then reporting as it goes through each of the iterations you
specified. In the above example, the -n 10 option indicates the
number of times the script should be invoked; by default, it's
100.
</p><p>
Note that the output files are put in the test directory (to which
you might not have write access by default). And, indeed, the output
files are quite useful, but they can be confusing the first time you look
at them.
</p><p>
The first output file, profile-output.txt, is (as the suffix implies)
a text file that shows how much time was spent in each method, both as
a time measure and as a percentage of the total run time. Consider
the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
%self     total     self     wait    child    calls  name
13.74     58.35    38.13     0.00    20.22   608720  Buffer#read
</pre>
</p><p>
This means there were 608,720 calls to Buffer#read during the
test, which took a total of 38.13 seconds, or 13.75% of the execution
time. Because this is a built-in method, you can't optimize it.
However, you can try to reduce the number of times it is called,
so that it will take even less time.
</p><p>
The question is, how do we know which functions are calling Buffer#read?
Perhaps reading from buffers is an inevitable part of a Web
application, and we just need to realize that?
</p><p>
If you look at the second file, profile-graph.html, you see a
nicely linked description of which methods called which other methods,
and how long it took. Each box represents the analysis of one method,
and the method being analyzed is printed in bold.
</p><p>
All of the methods above the boldfaced method name are parent methods
(that is, methods that called the one in question); whereas, methods below
the current one are child methods (that is, methods that are called by
the method being analyzed). By looking at who called Buffer#read, you
can see which methods (if any) need optimizing or a smaller number of
invocations. By going back and forth between methods, their parents
and the source code, you can cut down on a great deal of waste, making
your sites more efficient than before.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we looked at two basic profiling tools that programmers
can use to identify performance problems in Rails-based Web sites.
There are, of course, other tools we can use, but the fact that
these are so nicely integrated into Rails makes us all the more likely
to use them. With constant monitoring and tweaking, we can make our
sites run faster without having to resort to buying additional
servers.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails Way</em></span>, by Obie Fernandez, has become my favorite,
because it includes so much useful information, as well as code
examples. It doesn't try to teach you Rails, but it does provide a
great deal of information that is useful for advanced users as well as
newcomers.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Rails</em></span>, by Brad Ediger, gives some greater depth to several topics,
such as performance optimization, ActiveRecord features, RESTful
sites and internationalization, among others.
