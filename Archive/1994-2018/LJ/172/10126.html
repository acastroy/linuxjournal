<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #172, August 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Having to reboot production systems to incorporate <span   class="bold"><b>security patches</b></span> is
a pain. How much better would it be simply to graft the patch onto an
already running kernel, and let it keep running? This is exactly what
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Arnold</b></span> has been working on. He calls
it <span   class="bold"><b>KSplice</b></span>, and at least for
the moment, it supports any kernel that can load a module. The kernel
itself doesn't have to support the feature explicitly. The way it
works is that the user supplies the source tree for the running kernel
and the patch to graft on. Then, KSplice compiles the patch and loads
modules that apply the patch internally. Because of the interest it has
generated, it's looking very likely that KSplice will be accepted into
the kernel tree, at which point it might stop supporting kernels that
don't know about it.
</p><p>
One obstacle standing in the way of Jeff's work is <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft's legal
department</b></span>. During the course of discussion, it came out that patent
application 10/307,902 from 2002 seemed to cover Jeff's idea. And,
although a number of folks, including <span   class="bold"><b>Gilles
Espinasse</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span>,
said they'd been &ldquo;hot-patching&rdquo; operating systems since the 1990s and
earlier, <span   class="bold"><b>Bill Davidsen</b></span> felt that trying to launch a challenge against
a Microsoft patent would be prohibitively expensive. However,
according to Jeff, the patent application was rejected by the patent
office. So, Microsoft may give up at this point, depending
on its current internal weirdness level.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>NFS</b></span> is a lovely filesystem, but it has various problems that make
people want to replace it. One of the latest attempts is <span   class="bold"><b>POHMELFS</b></span>, or
Parallel Optimized Host Message Exchange Layered File System. POHMELFS
is written by <span   class="bold"><b>Evgeniy Polyakov</b></span>, and it is a user-space layer that can be
applied to any back-end filesystem, such as ReiserFS or XFS. It also
seems to outperform NFS fairly significantly, at least according to
the tests Evgeniy has performed so far. But, it's still only ready for
playing around with. People shouldn't use it to store data they want to
keep. Evgeniy says it's too soon to talk about the filesystem being
reliable for use. He's been able to do regular user activity on it
without a problem, but he expects to find bugs, POSIX conformance issues
and other issues.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>ReiserFS</b></span> has migrated its development from
the <span   class="bold"><b>NameSys</b></span> servers to
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span>, where work is continuing.
<span   class="bold"><b>Edward Shishkin</b></span> and others
continue to develop the filesystem in spite of <span   class="bold"><b>Hans
Reiser</b></span>'s murder
conviction. 
</p><p>
There have been various other maintainer updates. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>
is no longer the <span   class="bold"><b>PCI</b></span> maintainer; he's handed the whole kit and
kaboodle off to <span   class="bold"><b>Jesse Barnes</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Timur Tabi</b></span> has listed himself as the
official maintainer of the <span   class="bold"><b>Cirrus Logic
CS4270 sound driver</b></span>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>Freescale QUICC engine library</b></span>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>QUICC engine UCC UART driver</b></span> and
the <span   class="bold"><b>Freescale SOC sound drivers</b></span>. And,
<span   class="bold"><b>Zhang Wei</b></span> has abdicated
maintainership of the <span   class="bold"><b>Freescale DMA driver</b></span> and handed that project
over to <span   class="bold"><b>Li Yang</b></span>.
</p><p>
The politics of competing filesystems is never pretty. <span   class="bold"><b>LogFS</b></span> wants to
support Flash drives, but its development has been slower than some
people would like. So, <span   class="bold"><b>Artem Bityutskiy</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Hunter</b></span> recently
announced their own alternative, <span   class="bold"><b>UBIFS</b></span>, that is apparently quite a bit
further along than LogFS. It's faster, more stable and more
featureful, although it still has trouble with devices larger than 64G.
LogFS, developed by <span   class="bold"><b>Jorn Engel</b></span>, also came out with a new release,
perhaps partly in response to the UBIFS announcement. Of course,
nothing says there can't be two co-existing Flash filesystems, but
apparently one of the motivations for UBIFS was the relatively slow
pace of LogFS development. Artem in particular seemed bitter about
this, especially since it appeared that various folks were suggesting
waiting for LogFS instead of developing UBIFS, while UBIFS was already
superior to LogFS.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Wilcox</b></span> and others are trying to
eliminate as many <span   class="bold"><b>semaphores</b></span>
as they can from the kernel, and replace them with simpler locking
structures, such as mutexes, spinlocks and completions. The problem is
that semaphores provide additional features that are hard to mimic
with those other types of locks. For example, semaphores can manage
access to a cluster of resources, while other locks basically are just
on/off switches. The benefit of eliminating semaphores is that it's
possible to gain speed and, in the case of single-processor systems, to
optimize the lock entirely out of the compiled binary, resulting in
further speed gains. But to do this, key features of semaphores have
to be mimicked near any lock that replaces one. Matthew, <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de
Ven</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> are
addressing this by developing <span   class="bold"><b>kcounter</b></span>,
which will provide ways of managing access to clusters of resources,
similar to how semaphores do it.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, kcounter takes a cookie-based approach, similar to
other things that have been seen in the kernel before, which have
resulted in what <span   class="bold"><b>David Chinner</b></span> characterized as a very ugly interface.
Hopefully, kcounter will avoid that pitfall, although it does seem as
though a significant speedup might justify a little cookie ugliness.
That question undoubtedly will spawn some lively debate.

<h2 class="title">One Tale of Two Scientific Distros</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #172, August 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A few weeks ago, I was flying west past Chicago, watching the ground slide
by below, when I spotted the signature figure eight of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory, better known as Fermilab. I shot some pictures,
which I put up at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Flickr site
(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/linuxjournal/pool" target="_self">www.flickr.com/groups/linuxjournal/pool</a>, which runs on Linux too).

</p><p>
I figured Fermilab naturally would use Linux, and found that Fermilab has
its own distro: Fermi Linux. Its public site provides a nice window into
a highly professional and focused usage of Linux. Within Fermi Linux,
specific generations are known as Scientific Linux Fermi, each with version
numbers and the code names Charm, Strange, Top, Bottom, Up, Feynmann,
Wilson and Lederman.
</p><p>
Some also have LTS in their names. LTS stands for Long Term Support. It has
a FAQ. The first Q is, &ldquo;What is Fermi Linux LTS?&rdquo; The A goes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Fermi Linux LTS (Long Term Support) is, in essence, Red Hat Enterprise,
recompiled.
</p><p>
What we have done is taken the source code from Red Hat Enterprise (in
srpm form) and recompiled it. The resulting binaries (now in rpm form)
are then ours to do with as we desire, as long as we follow the license from
that original source code, which we are doing.
</p><p>
We are choosing to bundle all these binaries into a Linux distribution
that is as close to Red Hat Enterprise as we can get it. The goal is to
ensure that if a program runs and is certified on Red Hat Enterprise, then
it will run on the corresponding Fermi Linux LTS release.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
A follow-up Q goes, &ldquo;I really don't want to get into legal trouble, please
convince me that this is legal.&rdquo; The A says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
What we are doing is getting the source rpm of each Red Hat Enterprise
package from a publicly available area. Each of these packages, except for
a few, have the GPL license. This license states that we can freely
distribute that package. We are recompiling those packages without any
change. Hence, we can freely distribute those rpms that were built....And
although these rpms are basically identical to Red Hat's Enterprise Linux,
they were built by us and are freely distributable. We can do with them
what we want....
</p><p>
Although it is basically identical to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is, in
essence, a completely different release, just with the same programs,
packaged the same way.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Fermilab supports its own users and directs others toward Scientific
Linux, which was codeveloped by Fermilab, CERN and other laboratories and
universities. Troy Dawson is the primary contact for both Fermi Linux and
Scientific Linux. On his own site, he explains, &ldquo;Fermilab uses what is
called Fermi Linux. It is now based on Scientific Linux. It is actually a
site modification, so technically it is Scientific Linux Fermi. But we call
all of the releases we have made Fermi Linux.&rdquo;
</p><p>
While Fermi Linux's version history starts with 5.0x in 1998, Scientific
Linux's history starts with 3.0.1 in 2004. Both sites' current distribution
version pages have near-identical tables of releases, dates and notes. The
latest version for both is 5.x.
</p><p>
In a comment to an on-line <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8253" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8253</a>), William Roddy wrote,
&ldquo;Scientific Linux will work in any environment Red Hat would, and even
better. It's a work of art and genius, and in the field of high-energy
physics, if this Linux didn't work, it wouldn't be used. Yet, it is useful
to anyone. If you demand stability and security, you will not do better. It
will always be there and it will always be free.&rdquo;

For about a year, however, Microsoft has been working to get a slimmed-down
version of Windows to run on XO laptops. As a result, Negroponte said
Tuesday that he expects XOs to soon have a &ldquo;dual-boot&rdquo; option, meaning
users would be able to run Windows or Sugar....Eventually, Negroponte
added, Windows might be the sole operating system, and Sugar would be
educational software running on top of it.

One could play for hours with Google Trends (<a href="http://trends.google.com" target="_self">trends.google.com</a>). Not only
does it show the spikes and slopes of search volume across time since the
beginning of 2004, but it also lists the current top ten regions, cities and
languages for each search. You can search for multiple keywords, comma-separated, and see colored lines for each. The results are usually more
interesting than revealing. Such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Searches for Ronaldo and Beckham both spiked in 2005 at the last
World Cup.
</p></li><li><p>
Searches for John Paul and Ratzinger peaked one after the other in
early 2005 when the former died and the latter succeeded him as pope.
</p></li><li><p>
Searches for Linux and Microsoft have both gone down, the former
slightly more than the latter.
</p></li><li><p>
Searches for Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu show declines for the first two
and a steady rise for the third. Add Linux and find that Ubuntu has
almost overtaken Linux in search volume. Does the rise in Ubuntu
account for the decline in Linux searches? They seem somewhat
reciprocal, but who knows?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
What's more surprising are the top ten regions, cities and languages for
each. Some results for Linux:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Russia is the top region, closely followed by India and the Czech
Republic. The US is not among the top ten.
</p></li><li><p>
Beijing is the top city, followed by Tokyo and San Francisco, which
is the only US city. The rest, in order, are Milan, Frankfurt,
Augusta (Italy), Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid and London.
</p></li><li><p>
Russian is the top language, followed by German, Japanese, Italian,
Chinese, Polish, Finnish, Portuguese, English and Swedish.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Some results for Ubuntu:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Norway is the top region, followed by Italy and Russia. The US is
not on the list.
</p></li><li><p>
Milan is the top city, followed by San Francisco and Augusta (Italy).
The rest are Helsinki, Madrid, Paris, Santiago (Chile), Frankfurt,
Zurich and Mexico City.
</p></li><li><p>
Italian is the top language, followed by Finnish, Swedish, Russian,
French, Spanish, German, Polish, English and Portuguese.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Google's qualification: &ldquo;Google Trends aims to provide insights into broad
search patterns. Several approximations are used when computing your
results. Please keep this in mind when using it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Also keep in mind that these were results on May 13, 2008. Try them when you
read this to see how they change. Having used Google Trends for a while now,
I can assure you the answer is: a lot.

By 1988, Larry Bird had already won the three-point shootout twice. In the
locker room, while waiting to defend his title, he said to his opponents,
&ldquo;Who's finishing second?&rdquo; Then he went out and won for a third time.
</p><p>
Ubuntu is in the same position. In DistroWatch.com's Page Hit Ranking,
Ubuntu has been #1 for three years running. Mandrake (now Mandriva) was #1
in 2004. Ubuntu took over in 2005, then repeated in 2006 and 2007.
Meanwhile, the &ldquo;Who's finishing second?&rdquo; question is always up for grabs,

Geoff Goodell has a PhD in Computer Science from Harvard and is currently
researching Internet surveillance and network neutrality. Recently, I found
myself sitting next to Geoff, who was typing casually at a furious speed on
his ThinkPad, while looking at a black screen divided into four quadrants,
each apparently operating in command-line mode with colored type far too
small for my old eyes to read, but obviously quite legible to Geoff.
Because
it was too hard for me to eaveswatch, even at close range, I asked him if
he was an Emacs or a vi guy. He smiled and replied, &ldquo;vi&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, I asked him to let us know the rest of what he used, and
here's his reply:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I use a constellation of machines running Debian Linux. I store most of
my working files (such as research, code, papers and personal Web pages) in AFS,
which allows me to share data across machines seamlessly. For
authentication, I use a combination of MIT Kerberos and OpenSSH public
keys. I exchange multimedia files using rsync, and I use MPlayer for audio,
video and streaming.
</p><p>
For hardware, I use mainboards by Gigabyte, monitors by NEC and
Samsung, IBM M13 keyboards and multihead video cards by NVIDIA. My laptop
is an IBM ThinkPad T41, which also runs Debian Linux.
</p><p>
For software, I try to keep a low profile. My window manager is ion2,
which allows me to tile the screen with xterms and mostly avoid using the
mouse. My favorite font is 6x10, and my color scheme is something that
evolved over the years. For text editing, I use Vim. For e-mail, I use Mutt
and GnuPG. For IRC, I use Irssi. For browsing, I use Firefox plus NoScript
plus AdBlock Plus. For privacy, I also use Tor. I run Linuxnet IRC servers,
Apache Web servers and an exim4 mail server. I coordinate non-IRC instant
messaging through a set of gateways, so that my IRC client handles all
the interaction. I use LaTeX to write papers, personal letters and
presentations (occasionally I use OpenOffice.org for slides).
</p><p>
My ISP is Speakeasy. My domain registrar is GANDI (in France).
</p><p>
When not near a workstation or laptop, I have a Treo 750p (which runs a
lovely SSH client called pssh) and a Motorola H12 noise-canceling
Bluetooth headset.
