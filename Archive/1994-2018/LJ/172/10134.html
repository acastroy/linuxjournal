Hilbert II (<a href="http://www.qedeq.org" target="_self">www.qedeq.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Here's one for the mind-bending category. In this age of shared
information and decentralization comes another cool addition to the
realm of shared consciousness. Hilbert II attempts to resurrect and
build on the ideals of a near dead project, QED (check the link
at the end for a copy of QED's manifesto). Hilbert II's goals are:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...decentralised access to verified and readable mathematical knowledge. As
its name already suggests, this project is in the tradition of Hilbert's
program....Hilbert II wants to become a free, world-wide mathematical
knowledge base that contains mathematical theorems and proofs in a
formal correct form. All belonging documents are published under the
GNU Free Documentation License. We aim to adapt the common mathematical
argumentation to a formal syntax. That means, whenever in mathematics
a certain kind of argumentation is often used, we will look forward to
integrate it into the formal language of Hilbert II. This formal language
is called the QEDEQ format.
</p><p>
Hilbert II provides a program suite that enables a mathematician
to put theorems and proofs into that knowledge base. These proofs
are automatically verified by a proof-checker. Also, texts in &ldquo;common
mathematical language&rdquo; can be integrated. The mathematical axioms,
definitions and propositions are combined to so-called QEDEQ modules. Such
a module could be seen as a mathematical textbook that includes formal
correct proofs. Because this system is not centrally administrated and
references to any location in the Internet are possible, a world-wide
mathematical knowledge base could be built. Any proof of a theorem in this
&ldquo;mathematical web&rdquo; could be drilled down to the very elementary rules
and axioms. Think of an incredible number of mathematical textbooks with
hyperlinks, and each of its proofs could be verified by Hilbert II. For
each theorem, the dependency of other theorems, definitions and axioms
could be easily derived.

The Complex World of Mathematical Collaboration through Hilbert II
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
First things first, Hilbert II is a Java-based program. We generally
try to avoid Java-based projects because this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, not
&ldquo;Platform-Neutral Java Webstart Journal&rdquo;, but the cooler projects are
definitely worth examining, and besides, it does have a Linux-specific
version. For the lazy, there is a webstart version that can be launched
from your browser (see the link at the end of this section), which requires you
to have the Java browser plugins installed. For the Linux version, the
precondition for a working prototype is a Java Runtime Environment, at
least version 1.4. Hilbert II uses LaTeX for a lot of its functions,
and there are some potential bugs that frequent users may run into,
so check the Web site for further information on possible LaTeX requirements.
</p><p>
Head to the Download section of the Web site and download the Linux
tarball. Extract it to your directory of choice, and open a terminal in
the new qedeq directory.
</p><p>
At the console, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./qedeq_se.sh  
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if that doesn't work, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh qedeq_se.sh
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Hilbert II works around XML files, and you'll need some of these XML files
to get started. If you choose File&rarr;Load from web, a default file is
provided from which you can begin to experiment. If you look in the
main window, there's a tab called QEDEQ. Clicking on any entry on the
left displays its nuts and bolts in this tab. Under Tools&rarr;LaTeX to QEDEQ, you can start playing around with your own formulae,
and under Check&rarr;Check Mathematical Logic, you can make sure that your
syntax and so on check out. To export your work for the world to see, going
to
Transform&rarr;Create LaTeX output creates a new LaTeX .tex file in the
generated folder under qedeq.
</p><p>
But from here, you're on your own, because I haven't got a clue what
I'm talking about in this world of advanced mathematics and formulae
(and I've probably said something wildly inaccurate in the process of
writing this section). However, I'm keen to see the results of this
academic collaboration, where ideally knowledge should keep advancing and
continue to be built upon, and I hope to see more of these mind-bending
shared-consciousness projects.

Ever been stuck working on a text-only mailing server and wished you had
some sort of decent gaming distraction? Well, you have a lot of options,
such as adventure text games and <span   class="emphasis"><em>moon-buggy</em></span>, but my favorite discovery
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span>, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> clone with full color and many options. According
to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> is a terminal-based
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> clone by Victor Nilsson. Gameplay
is much like the early <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> games by Nintendo. Features include:

</p></li></ul></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It has been tested on Linux, Cygwin, NetBSD and a few other UNIX-like
systems. Library dependencies are minimal (only libc is required),
and many features can be disabled at compile time.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10134f2.large.jpg"><img src="10134f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> provides two-player <span  class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> fun
without graphics.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
For those who prefer binaries, included at the Web site are links
to RPM packages and some tarballs built with gcc 3.4.6 for i486 Linux on
Slackware 11.0. However, <span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> has very few
dependencies, and 99% of
you should be able to compile it from the source tarball
(saving you from some of the inevitable binary incompatibility). Indeed,
this is the easiest and most trouble-free compilation I've encountered
in a long time, so I recommend compiling it.
</p><p>
Grab the latest tarball from the project's Web site,
extract the contents, and open a terminal in the new folder. Once inside
the vitetris directory, enter the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1992580.0x1e83f70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once compiled, typing <tt  >tetris</tt> at the command line
loads the game.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once inside the game, you'll see a heap of cool options. For instance,
you can change the height of the level you're in, enable rotation in
both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, and switch between game
modes. These two game modes enable or disable attacking the other player
with completed lines and adding them to the bottom of their stack (game mode
A is for attacking enabled, and B is for disabled). To start a game by yourself,
choose 1 Player Game, and choose your difficulty level and game height
to begin. On your keyboard, the left and right arrows move each piece
left and right; the up arrow rotates the piece on screen; the down arrow
makes a &ldquo;soft drop&rdquo;;
and the spacebar makes a &ldquo;hard drop&rdquo;, straight to the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
If you want to change the keys or switch between rotation methods and
so on, you can to that from the Options menu. If you want to play a
two-player game, you also have to define Player 2's keys here. If you're
having any problems displaying <span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> in your
console and want to change
the game's colors, or even switch to a monochrome mode, those options
are available in the Options menu as well.
</p><p>
Ultimately, <span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> is a great
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span> clone by itself, but coupled with
the fact that it runs on the command line without graphics,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vitetris</em></span> is
a great addition to any system and will be a nice distraction the next time
the X Window System won't start!

Tetuhi (<a href="http://halo.gen.nz/tetuhi/code.html" target="_self">halo.gen.nz/tetuhi/code.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This was the craziest project I came across this month! Tetuhi is
basically a program that takes an image and generates a game around it,
but its appeal doesn't end there. Aside from making landscapes from
parts of the image, Tetuhi also creates characters from other parts of
the image, as well as other objects, such as food, ammo, friends
and enemies, which all wriggle and move about as the engine morphs sections
of the original image. On top of all that, it also has a dynamic and
adaptive rule set with changing game modes&mdash;meaning each game and image
may be truly random and different from the last.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10134f3.large.jpg"><img src="10134f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
I realise this crayon drawing itself doesn't show off Tetuhi's
capabilities, but imagine that the hills and trees are pulsating in
front of you and you are driving the sun....No, I'm not on mushrooms!
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Tetuhi is definitely something that is still in development, so the
usual <tt  >configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt> won't do you much good
here. In terms of requirements, you need up-to-date versions of
Python, GCC, Pygame, the Python Imaging Library, PyYAML and the Gnu
Scientific Library. Once you've got those installed, head to the Tetuhi
Web site and grab either the latest tarball or the latest code from
the GIT repository.
</p><p>
Once you have either of those, extract it (if you have the tarball), and
look at the directories c, img-c and perceptron. Open a terminal, and
enter each one of these directories and run the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1992580.0x1e84ac8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make python-install
</pre>
</p><p>
This should work in all three directories without errors. If not, make
sure you have all of the previously mentioned libraries installed and
up to date.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Now that the compiling is out of the way, head back to the main tetuhi
directory, and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./tetuhi nameofimagehere.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
If everything has compiled properly, an image with some crazy
instructions should appear on screen, walking you through the first steps
of the game. The best types of images to use are those with simplicity,
such as stark backgrounds with bold elements at the forefront. Included
on the Tetuhi Web page is a link to a tarball containing sample images for
testing. My favorite is &ldquo;hills-cars.jpg&rdquo;, whose line of land, trees and a
car pulses and gyrates, while you control a wiggling sun&mdash;making for
the trippiest game experience I've had in some time. Once you've enjoyed
the first few plays, you may want to make a symlink to a pathed directory
so that you don't have to keep entering Tetuhi's source directory.
</p><p>
Although the games themselves are rather simplistic (and lame in
most cases), it's the implications of the image manipulation that are of
real interest here. I can see parts of the code foundation making
it into much larger-scale projects in the gaming and multimedia area
in the future. Tetuhi's creator, Douglas Bagnall, is making particular
efforts so that Tetuhi can be included on the One Laptop Per Child
XO laptop, so it'll be interesting to see what kind of games and
drawings children around the world will come up with to play in connection
with Tetuhi's game rules.

</p><p>
joyevmouse is a joystick-to-mouse mapper that converts joystick events
to mouse events. Of course, this means that lazy people like myself who
watch endless episodes of anime and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Top Gear</em></span> won't have to get off the
couch. Conveniently, joyevmouse also runs entirely in user space. It does
not run as a kernel driver nor does it need a patch. Extra documentation and users
are lacking at this point, so check it out and see if it suits your needs.

The Stump Window Manager</b></span> (Stumpwm, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm" target="_self">www.nongnu.org/stumpwm</a>)
</p><p>
Stumpwm is a keyboard-driven, minimalist X11 window manager written
in Common Lisp. Despite its visually minimalist approach (there are no
window decorations, icons or even buttons), Stumpwm is designed to be
fully customizable and very powerful. And, judging by its main feature,
I'd say it is so, because Stumpwm is designed to be hackable while the
actual program is running. The ultimate control freak will love this,
and any Lisp fans also should to take a gander.
