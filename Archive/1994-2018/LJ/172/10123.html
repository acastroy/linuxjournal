Why let your Wii have all the fun? Find out how to connect your
Wiimote to your computer and use it as a mouse or an input device for
any number of popular gaming emulators.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d213b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you think about it, there are almost as many ways to interface with
your computer as there are Debian-based distributions&mdash;and that's a
lot. Besides the trusty keyboard and optical mouse, there are trackpoint
mice, touchpads, touchscreens, twiddlers, joysticks, presentation remotes
and
even devices that measure your brain waves. Although I mostly stick with my
tried-and-true keyboard and trackpoint mouse (fingers on home row, thank
you), when I started hearing about all the interesting things people
were doing with the Wiimote (the main controller from the Nintendo Wii),
I knew I had to give it a try.
</p><p>
Now traditionally, connecting a brand-new device to a Linux machine
was an investment in Internet research, kernel module hacking, prayer
and obscure programming skills I haven't used since college. I figured
the mere fact that this was a Bluetooth device meant I was going to have
to spend some quality time with hcidump. To my surprise, all the hard
work already had been done for me, and I could connect and use a Wiimote
on my laptop with only a few basic steps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21618"></a>
Configure udev</h2></div></div><p>
First, your kernel needs the uinput module available and loaded. This
module is available in modern kernels, and my Ubuntu Gutsy install
already had it. If you want to be able to connect to the Wiimote
as a regular user, however, you need to add a new udev rule
to extend permissions to the uinput device. I created a file called
/etc/udev/rules.d/95-uinput.rules that contained the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="plugdev"
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I made sure my user was a member of the plugdev group. If your
system doesn't have a plugdev group, you could choose or create another
group to use for this device. Next, run <tt  >/etc/init.d/udev
reload</tt> to make
sure your changes are seen. Finally, I ran <tt  >modprobe
uinput</tt> to make sure
the module was loaded, and I also added uinput to /etc/modules to make
sure it was loaded at boot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21880"></a>
Install wminput</h2></div></div><p>
The next step is to install the wminput software. For me, this was simple,
as wminput is packaged for my distribution; otherwise, you can download
the source from the official site (<a href="http://www.cwiid.org" target="_self">www.cwiid.org</a>).
Then, make sure the Bluetooth device
in your computer is enabled. For my laptop, I had to flip a switch on the
side, but if you have an external USB Bluetooth adapter, for instance,
now is a good time to plug it in. Finally, run wminput in a console and
follow the directions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@minimus:~$ wminput
Put Wiimote in discoverable mode now (press 1+2)...
Ready.
</pre>
</p><p>
When you press buttons 1 and 2 on your Wiimote, it goes into
discoverable mode, and the blue LEDs along the bottom start
blinking. Sometimes you might not start discoverable mode fast enough,
or wminput won't detect it, but as long as the LEDs on the Wiimote are
blinking, it is still in that mode. So if wminput times out, just run
the program again.
</p><p>
If you continually can't connect, you probably should double-check
that your Bluetooth device is working. To do this, press buttons 1 and 2
on the Wiimote and then use hcitool to scan for the Wiimote. A successful
scan will look like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@minimus:~$ hcitool scan
Scanning ...
           00:1B:7A:3E:8C:54    Nintendo RVL-CNT-01
</pre>
</p><p>
After wminput connects, you also can look in /var/log/dmesg for
confirmation that the Wiimote is connected:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[ 1226.247203] usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using 
 &#8618;uhci_hcd and address 13
[ 1226.288768] usb 3-2: configuration #1 chosen 
 &#8618;from 1 choice
[ 1227.922403] input: Nintendo Wiimote as 
 &#8618;/devices/virtual/input/input21
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d21bf0"></a>
Use the Wiimote as a Mouse</h2></div></div><p>
Once the Wiimote is connected, the default bindings use it as a
mouse. The accelerometers in the Wiimote are used to move the mouse
pointer, so if you point the Wiimote down or up, the mouse will move
down or up, respectively, and if you roll the Wiimote to the left or
right, the mouse will move left or right, respectively. If you look at
/etc/cwiid/wminput/buttons, you can see the default mappings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wiimote.A               = BTN_LEFT
Wiimote.B               = BTN_RIGHT
Wiimote.Up              = KEY_UP
Wiimote.Down    = KEY_DOWN
Wiimote.Left    = KEY_LEFT
Wiimote.Right   = KEY_RIGHT
Wiimote.Minus   = KEY_BACK
Wiimote.Plus    = KEY_FORWARD
Wiimote.Home    = KEY_HOME
Wiimote.1               = KEY_PROG1
Wiimote.2               = KEY_PROG2
...
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, wminput reads the configuration listed in
/etc/cwiid/wminput/default to get its mappings. In this file you will see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#acc_ptr

include buttons

Plugin.acc.X    = REL_X
Plugin.acc.Y    = REL_Y
</pre>
</p><p>
Essentially, this file includes the buttons file for keybindings, and
it also enables the use of the accelerometers for X and Y movements.
The
great thing about wminput is that all these mappings are completely
configurable. If you look in /etc/cwiid/wminput, you should see a number
of other example mappings you can use as inspiration. You also
can store custom mappings in your home directory under ~/.cwiid/wminput. The
button mappings use standard names for keys and mouse buttons that can
be found in /usr/include/linux/input.h, but most of the names are pretty
straightforward.

Wiimotes for NES Emulation</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first things I wanted to do with my Wiimote after it was
connected was to use it as a controller for my various game system
emulators. But, before I go any further, if you do use a game system
emulator like nestra, fceu, snes9x or MAME, be sure you have full
rights to use any ROMs you might have. Make an appointment with your
lawyer for details, but essentially, to play a commercial ROM, you should
own the corresponding game.
</p><p>
With the legal disclaimers aside, the Wiimote makes a great wireless NES
(Nintendo Entertainment System) controller. All the basic buttons
are there, and all that's left to do is rearrange the button mappings
to work with either nestra or fceu NES emulators. Both programs use
slightly different mappings, so I created files called buttons-fceu and
buttons-nestra and placed them in ~/.cwiid/wminput. First, buttons-nestra:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wiimote.A               = KEY_0
Wiimote.B               = KEY_1
Wiimote.Up              = KEY_LEFT
Wiimote.Down    = KEY_RIGHT
Wiimote.Left    = KEY_DOWN
Wiimote.Right   = KEY_UP
Wiimote.Minus   = KEY_TAB
Wiimote.Plus    = KEY_ENTER
Wiimote.Home    = KEY_PAUSE
Wiimote.1               = KEY_Z
Wiimote.2               = KEY_SPACE
</pre>
</p><p>
After I set the regular NES buttons, I had a few extra to bind, so I bound
the A button to pause the emulator, the B button to set nestra to normal
speed and the home button to reset the game.
</p><p>
The fceu emulator had completely different keybindings, so here is my
buttons-fceu file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wiimote.A               = KEY_F7
Wiimote.B               = KEY_F5
Wiimote.Up              = KEY_A
Wiimote.Down    = KEY_S
Wiimote.Left    = KEY_Z
Wiimote.Right   = KEY_W
Wiimote.Minus   = KEY_TAB
Wiimote.Plus    = KEY_ENTER
Wiimote.Home    = KEY_F10
Wiimote.1               = KEY_KP2
Wiimote.2               = KEY_KP3
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to the standard buttons, I bound the B button to save a game
state, A to restore and home to reset the game.
</p><p>
Now, to use either of these configuration files, all I need to do is tell
wminput to load these files instead:


<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@minimus:~/$ wminput -c ~/.cwiid/wminput/buttons-nestra 
Put Wiimote in discoverable mode now (press 1+2)...
Ready.
</pre>
</p><p>
Because wminput sends regular keyboard events, I don't have to do anything
special to nestra or fceu.

Wiimotes for SNES Emulation</h2></div></div><p>
The Wiimote worked great for NES games, but how about SNES (Super
Nintendo) emulation? I actually purchased a few different SNES games for
the Wii virtual console, and I also bought a Classic Controller so I would
have all the standard SNES buttons. It turns out that wminput also
can bind keys to the Nunchuck and Classic Controller attachments, so all I
had to do for it to work with snes9x was create a new configuration
file that mapped all the keys. Here is my buttons-snes9x file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wiimote.A               = KEY_X
Wiimote.B               = KEY_S
Wiimote.Up              = KEY_LEFT
Wiimote.Down    = KEY_RIGHT
Wiimote.Left    = KEY_DOWN
Wiimote.Right   = KEY_UP
Wiimote.Minus   = KEY_TAB
Wiimote.Plus    = KEY_ENTER
Wiimote.Home    = KEY_ESC
Wiimote.1               = KEY_C
Wiimote.2               = KEY_D

Nunchuk.C               = BTN_LEFT
Nunchuk.Z               = BTN_RIGHT

Classic.Up              = KEY_UP
Classic.Down    = KEY_DOWN
Classic.Left    = KEY_LEFT
Classic.Right   = KEY_RIGHT
Classic.Minus   = KEY_SPACE
Classic.Plus    = KEY_ENTER
Classic.Home    = KEY_ESC
Classic.A               = KEY_D
Classic.B               = KEY_C
Classic.X               = KEY_S
Classic.Y               = KEY_X
#Classic.ZL             = 
#Classic.ZR             = 
Classic.L               = KEY_A
Classic.R               = KEY_Z
</pre>
</p><p>
Even though I planned to use the Classic Controller, I tried to map as
many of the regular Wiimote keys to buttons that made sense, so you could
potentially play at least some games with the regular Wiimote as well. If
you notice, I also left bindings for the special ZL and ZR keys blank,
so you could bind them to extra keys.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c29580.0x1d22538"></a>
Wiimote Control for MAME</h2></div></div><p>
One of the best game system emulators out there is MAME. MAME emulates
classic arcade games, and there are many guides out there (including
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> itself) on how to use MAME to create your own arcade
cabinet. Well, I haven't cleared away the time for that project yet, but
I did want to use my Wiimote and Classic Controller attachment for MAME
games. MAME has a large number of bindings (press Tab in MAME to see a
list),
so it was difficult to choose which to bind to the extra keys. Here is
a sample buttons-xmame file I created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Wiimote.A               = KEY_P
Wiimote.B               = KEY_5
Wiimote.Up              = KEY_LEFT
Wiimote.Down    = KEY_RIGHT
Wiimote.Left    = KEY_DOWN
Wiimote.Right   = KEY_UP
Wiimote.Minus   = KEY_2
Wiimote.Plus    = KEY_1
Wiimote.Home    = KEY_F3
Wiimote.1               = KEY_LEFTCTRL
Wiimote.2               = KEY_LEFTALT

Nunchuk.C               = BTN_LEFT
Nunchuk.Z               = BTN_RIGHT

Classic.Up              = KEY_UP
Classic.Down    = KEY_DOWN
Classic.Left    = KEY_LEFT
Classic.Right   = KEY_RIGHT
Classic.Minus   = KEY_2
Classic.Plus    = KEY_1
Classic.Home    = KEY_F3
Classic.A               = KEY_LEFTCTRL
Classic.B               = KEY_LEFTALT
Classic.X               = KEY_SPACE
Classic.Y               = KEY_LEFTSHIFT
Classic.ZL              = KEY_5
Classic.ZR              = KEY_P
Classic.L               = KEY_Z
Classic.R               = KEY_X
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to the standard bindings you might expect, the home key resets
MAME; the plus key selects single player; minus selects two players;
ZL on the Classic Controller and B on the Wiimote insert a coin; and
ZR on the Classic Controller and A on the Wiimote pause. These are by
no means perfect bindings, so I recommend you experiment with different
keys that work better for you.
</p><p>
The possibilities with wminput go much further than what I've presented
here. There also are configuration files that use the analog joystick
inputs on the Classic Controller, the IR sensors on the Wiimote and
the accelerometers on the Nunchuck. Wminput isn't just a handy way to
play video games on your laptop or desktop. The fact that the connection
to the computer is wireless makes the Wiimote a great gaming input 
for a MythTV client or other computer connected to your PC. As for me,
I think I'll be spending a few more days trying to beat this impossible
Super Mario Brothers hack that has been floating around the Internet.
