Play digital video, view photos and listen to audio from memory cards or
hard disks, or browse YouTube and record TV shows in MP4 with this small
Linux-based box. Oh, and you can hack it too&mdash;it's open source.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x232d2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Neuros OSD is a very small and energy-efficient box that can play
digital video, photos and music from several sources, including the
Internet, on any TV or home theater system. It also can do the
opposite&mdash;convert analog video in real time from RCA or S-Video inputs to
MP4 format, save it on memory cards, external USB drives or, thanks
to its Ethernet port, remote computers. For a Linux/free-software fan,
the OSD also is interesting because it runs customizable, Linux-based
firmware (OSD stands for Open-Source Device).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9999f1.large.jpg"><img src="9999f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Main Features</h2></div></div><p>
One of the main reasons for buying an OSD is
backup and consolidation of video archives. It's one small box, much
cheaper than a normal computer, and it's all you need to migrate tens or
hundreds of VCR tapes or DVDs onto one
hard drive&mdash;if you accept
the unavoidable degradation that comes from recording from an analog
output. The user interface also has specific settings to optimize recording
from a PlayStation. Additionally, a timed recording function also makes the
OSD into a
bare-bones PVR.
</p><p>
Going the opposite direction, the OSD can play 
anything it finds on memory cards, USB drives or remote
devices on its RCA or S-Video ports. Particularly interesting is the presence of a
YouTube browser. Besides MP4, the list of supported formats available
on the Neuros Web site includes several variants of .avi, .asf, .mov and
others. The firmware upgrade procedure described later in this article can add even more
features to the OSD.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9999f2.large.jpg"><img src="9999f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

What You Get with the OSD</h2></div></div><p>
When I opened the box, I found several accessories: remote control
with batteries, two RCA cables, multivoltage power supply, serial cable and
an infrared blaster for controlling your TV, cable box or satellite receiver
through the OSD. I got the non-US set, which also includes two RCA-to-SCART
adapters. As far as I can tell, that and the plug on the power supply
are the only differences between the European and US kits.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9999f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Cables, Adapters and Other Accessories Included in the European Kit
</p></div></div><p>
The remote comes with very detailed instructions for controlling most TV
sets. There also is a Learning Mode with which it can learn the main
functions of your TV or VCR remote by directly &ldquo;listening&rdquo; while you use it.
</p><p>
Finally, the OSD has a plastic stand that holds it in a vertical position,
which I didn't find particularly robust or useful. All the plug-and-forget
cables are on one side: power, RCA in and out, S-Video input, IR blaster,
serial and Ethernet interfaces. The &ldquo;user&rdquo; ports&mdash;two for memory
cards and one for USB&mdash;are on the opposite side. With this layout,
the OSD is more stable, which makes it easier to fit on the shelves of
ordinary home theatre furniture, as it is flat on the bottom
with the user ports facing the room.
</p><p>
I have tested the Neuros OSD on a standard analog PAL TV with a 16:9
32" screen, a generic 1GB USB MP3 player and a 128MB SD memory
card from Dikom. For network-related tests, I connected it to a port
of a D-Link 604T ADSL modem/router.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x232e000"></a>
Firmware Upgrade</h2></div></div><p>
Because the first thing you see when you open the box is a big, red sheet of paper
saying, &ldquo;Please upgrade firmware immediately&rdquo;, that's what I did. The
procedure is simple, requiring just a bit of attention. Depending on how
old the firmware loaded in your own OSD is with respect to the latest
upgrade, some steps I cover here may be different, and some upgrading methods may not apply.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9999f5.large.jpg"><img src="9999f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Waiting While the Firmware Upgrades, 1980s Style
</p></div></div><p>
First, hook up the OSD to your TV, and check which firmware
version it currently is running by going to the Settings&rarr;Properties menu of the
on-screen
user interface. In my case, the version was 3.31-1.24. According to the Neuros
Web site, this version wasn't new enough to upgrade directly from the
Internet, so I had to download the latest one manually. In my case,
this was an 11.7MB file called osd-3.33-1.75-02.849.upk.
</p><p>
Next, I copied that .upk file to a USB key, plugged it in to the OSD,
selected the package from the file browser and ran the &ldquo;Upgrade
firmware&rdquo;
option. I chose a USB key because it was handy on my desk, even
though the Web site warned that my current firmware may not be able
to upgrade from such a device. Sure enough, when I tried it, the upgrade
failed in less than one minute, with a &ldquo;Sorry, package error&rdquo; message.
</p><p>
The OSD, however, safely rebooted, so I got the memory card,
plugged it in, copied the .upk file from the key to the card with the
OSD file manager and re-issued the upgrade command. Everything went fine,
and in about ten minutes I had the firmware that, among other things,
can upgrade directly from the Internet or schedule automatic upgrades
of stable or test versions at whatever frequency I choose.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x232e4d0"></a>
Setting Up and Using the OSD</h2></div></div><p>
After upgrading, you'll see a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; screen that
invites you to set up the OSD through a few interactive screens. The first
one is for LAN configuration. Just as during a standard Linux
installation, both static and DHCP configurations are possible. I tried
them both without any problems. After configuring network and Wi-Fi, which
you can skip altogether, you can configure the IR blaster.
</p><p>
Once everything was up and running, I finally started using the OSD.
I've
played MP3 files, recorded and played TV shows and YouTube clips and
browsed digital pictures. After testing, I can say that the OSD works as
advertised. Some parts of the user interface could be more efficient,
but all in all, it is simple to use. A French language pack is already
available, and Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch and Portuguese should follow
soon.
</p><p>
The menu system is similar to standard living-room DVD players, with a
sliding bar on the bottom that tells you how much free space there is
on the internal memory or the external devices (memory cards or USB drives)
you are using. You also can customize the graphic theme and screensaver.
</p><p>
There are three video recording modes. The first is called Quickstart, defined
in the OSD manual as &ldquo;take a leap of faith and simply press
Record&rdquo;. The second
is Standard mode, where you can change parameters, and
finally, there's Advanced mode, which provides more flexibility and control but requires
a bit more competence for proper use. Image and audio quality of
TV recordings were almost indistinguishable from the originals, even
with the default settings.
</p><p>
The remote has standard, VCR-like keys to control video playback. Video
recorded with the OSD takes about one hour per gigabyte at the highest
quality. The maximum duration of a recording depends on the maximum file
size supported by the host filesystem.
</p><p>
The YouTube browser is simple but effective. All the essential functions
are grouped in Videos, Search, Favorites and Settings submenus. The
Videos menu has buttons for listing all new clips or just the most-viewed
ones for the time period you choose (day, week, month or year). Once you 
find the video you want, the OSD plays it full-screen. YouTube quality
on standard TVs isn't great, but that's not the OSD's fault,
and there are no glitches during playback if your Internet connection
is fast enough.
</p><p>
The OSD photo viewer has full-screen, thumbnail and slideshow modes. In
slideshow mode, you can configure the duration of each slide. The audio
player has a playlist-creation functionality.
</p><p>
In my tests, all types of files (video, audio and pictures) were played
with the same quality, without degradation or other problems, no matter
whether they were on a memory card, USB drive or computer on the local network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x232e948"></a>
Hey, the Command Line!</h2></div></div><p>
The OSD is a nice and small box with serial port, Ethernet port, Linux inside
and very little power consumption. Besides a graphical interface built
on the Qtopia toolkit, it has a LUA interpreter, a Telnet server and
BusyBox. If this doesn't make a hacker want to mess with the OSD, nothing
will. As a matter of fact, there already is a community customizing and
extending the OSD in various ways or using it as a mini-server. To get
inside the OSD, simply type <tt  >telnet</tt> and the IP address, then log in as root
with the default password, pablod. This drops you into a standard shell,
within the limits of BusyBox. 
</p><p>
In order to browse my PC partition from
the TV, using the OSD remote, I simply typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /media/polaris
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.2:/mydata/osd_test /media/polaris
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that, besides Telnet, you also can open an OSD console on
your TV from the Advanced applications menu. The on-screen keyboard
is much slower to use, but all the keys are there.

Advanced Features and Hacking</h2></div></div><p>
The Advanced applications menu also lists an MP4 Video editor
(beta). When I tried it on an MP4 file on my computer, it
wouldn't even open the NFS-mounted directory, which, as I already
mentioned,
was reachable without problems by the OSD file browser and picture
viewer. Neuros confirmed to me that this application is still
just an experiment, usable only on small clips stored in the cards or
USB drives.

</p></div></div><p>
The list of features coming soon, some of which are Google Summer of Code
projects, is really interesting. Besides Samba, Web and FTP servers,
the latest announcements mention streaming via Fuse, a Last.fm client
and an Ogg Theora codec. Currently, the software that actually plays
movies and music and shows the menus, called osdmain, is not designed
to communicate with other programs. However, work already is ongoing to
overcome this limitation and interact with the OSD over LAN. For more
information,
check out the Neuros Developer Web site (see Resources).

OSD in the Family and on the Road</h2></div></div><p>
Besides the main scenarios listed in the Neuros ads, I plan mostly to
use the OSD in three other ways that are more interesting to
me. First, the OSD makes it possible for kids to play YouTube clips,
photos from their digital cameras or their MP3 playlists in the
living room, without messing with dad's computer. Second,
as the OSD is so small and light, I see it as a traveler's friend.
Take it with you on vacations to view your digital photos right away
on any motel TV or back them up to a USB drive, without carrying along
a more expensive, fragile and bulkier laptop. Portability and the small size
also mean I finally will be able to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; hours of
VHS family movies whenever I visit relatives who often don't even own
a computer. Saying, &ldquo;Hi, Auntie, may I plug this tiny box in to your VCR
and leave it there while we have dinner?&rdquo; takes more time than actually
doing it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x27274e0"></a>
Missing Pieces and Problems</h2></div></div><p>
The USB interface supports only the 1.1 version of the standard. Neuros
itself warns that recording to USB could cause frame drops due to speed
bottlenecks. Adding a memory card adapter (which Neuros sells separately)
to the kit would have made it more versatile. Also, the list of supported
formats isn't 100% reliable. The firmware I tested, for example, can't
handle the .mov videos generated by my Kodak camera. The audio played
fine, but all I saw was a black screen.
</p><p>
The first thing I thought when I read the OSD datasheet was that
the absence of digital inputs makes it impossible to copy DVDs or DV
tapes without degradation. Neuros answered that the OSD is meant to
offer flexibility and compatibility with the most common TV sets, at an
affordable cost and with the simplest possible interface. They explained
(and I agreed with them) that, in this context, adding digital output is
not really necessary, especially because it wouldn't sensibly increase
the final display quality. Digital input, instead, would have increased
the cost enough to make the OSD really hard to sell.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2235580.0x2727640"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
All in all, I only had one real problem with the OSD, which I saved for
last because it is (potentially) quite serious and also because it may
well be solved by the time you read this.
</p><p>
As I mentioned before, the single functions work fine. The user interface,
however, froze badly enough, in certain cases, to make the OSD unusable
without doing a power cycle. To be more specific, this happened regularly when I had
the Ethernet cable, the USB key and memory card all plugged in at the same
time. The memory
card alone also slowed the device, so part of the problem may
be physical or formatting problems with the card itself. Even with other
configurations, however, I noticed a recurring pattern. Heavy-load tasks,
like playing or encoding video or audio, would go on without
problem for hours, but using the remote too quickly or for more
than a few minutes could slow down the OSD to a halt, especially when
a storage device was plugged in.
</p><p>
By the looks of it, this is almost surely a bug in the particular firmware
version that I tested, so don't judge the OSD by this problem, and 
check the Neuros Web site for updates. The Neuros OSD remains a 
handy and versatile device, although it's not exactly cheap. Taken one by one,
all the features work well, and the device can be hacked and extended in
many ways, so it could be a useful addition to your digital living room.

Price and Availability</b></p><p>
At the time of this writing in May 2008, the OSD sells for $179 US at the
Neuros on-line
store. Outside the US, it will be available in some department stores in
the UK and France (starting in June), with broader distribution in other countries
starting later in the summer of 2008.
