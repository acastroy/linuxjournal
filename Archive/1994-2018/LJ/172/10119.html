Wow, what a great article by Louis Iacona [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, April
2008, &ldquo;Puppy Linux&rdquo;]. I was pleasantly surprised to
find it so in depth for a magazine article, which is usually no more than
two pages. It definitely encouraged me to try Puppy Linux, which I will
do. I hope to see more articles by this gentleman and hope he was well
paid. Thank you for such a great magazine.

I have noticed mention of ISOs now and then in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
articles.
</p><p>
While working on our own applications, we've often gone searching on the
Internet for tools and applications that might already be found in the
form of a ready-to-run ISO.
</p><p>
Because ISOs are relatively new to the public, we concluded that
currently, it is difficult to find such works or list them if you are an
author.
</p><p>
Therefore, we have created a new site, <a href="http://www.isotogo.com" target="_self">www.isotogo.com</a>, to help the
public and authors in working with ISOs. There is no cost to use it or to
list your works, and because it is new, we are working hard on moving up the
search engine ladder.

Dave Phillips is effusive in his praise of the OLPC XO
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, June 2008], and most of it is
well deserved, indeed. But it must be conceded that the keyboard is a
piece of absolute trash. After just a few hours of use, mine developed
keys that stick or fail to actuate or actuate with Alt applied
unpredictably. This got worse until it was completely unusable. A Google
search turned up many such complaints and detailed instructions for
excising and replacing the keyboard (serious tinkerers only!). The USB
keyboard is really a necessity, but that is not convenient in all
circumstances.
</p><p>
The mouse does have two active buttons, as you can verify by copying the
binary of gpm from a compatible system (I use Fedora Core 6 on a Dell
Latitude). Run it as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpm -m /dev/input/mouse0 -t ps2 -r 5 -a 3
</pre>
</p><p>
and play with the -r and -a settings to get it the way you like.
</p><p>
The display is a little bit strange. Plotting a bunch of random pixels in
white on a black screen makes red, green and blue dots. A white-on-black
line may show bands of color, depending on the point density and
inclination. So your favorite graphics apps may need some tweaking.
</p><p>
If you want to run something that uses SVGALIB, you need my framebuffer
version of that. It's not complete yet, but it does basic pixel, line and
block functions. I'll put it on my SourceForge site soon, but meanwhile,
if interested, send me a note at <a href="mailto:mcconnau@biochem.wustl.edu">mcconnau@biochem.wustl.edu</a>.

The June 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> published a letter from
David Newall, which 
responded to a letter from Joao Macedo published in the February 2008 issue,
which was, in turn, a response to Dave Taylor's column in the December 2007
issue. Both Joao and David wrote in with one-liners using the echo and bc
commands to do floating-point calculations in place of using Dave Taylor's
solve.sh script. Joao's example embedded an actual newline character,
whereas David Newall's used the escape code version of the same. There is
yet another way to do this, and it is, in fact, my preference, as it is much
more intuitive to folks accustomed to writing shell scripts. In
bourne-shell scripts, a semicolon can be used to place commands together
on a single line. It can be used for the same purpose with bc. Here is a
third rewrite of the example to demonstrate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 'scale=4;11/7' | bc
</pre>

First off, great magazine! While reading page 13, in the UpFront
section [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, June 2008, &ldquo;Eee PC Gets an
Upgrade&rdquo;], Doc talks about the upgrade that the Eee PC is getting, along the
lines of the larger screen, larger SSD hard drive and more memory. He
lists the new Eee PC 900 as having 1GB of RAM, and say that this is &ldquo;up from
512KB&rdquo;. I dunno about you, but my Eee PC (from which I am sending
this letter)
has 512 <span   class="emphasis"><em>megabytes, not kilobytes</em></span>! If yours has 512KB
of RAM, you should send
it back! Great magazine, small typo, I forgive you!

I just wanted to send a quick note to thank all of the contributors to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
You have inspired me over the past couple of years to migrate over to
Linux as my OS of choice and motivated me to learn new projects. I am in
the middle of setting up an LTSP project for our home-schooling community
and using info gained from various <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> articles and book recommendations.
</p><p>
Keep up the good work. Hopefully I will send some converts your way
soon!

I'm happy to see the coverage of Sony's use of Linux in the June 2008 issue.
There is actually an even bigger list of Sony products running Linux at
<a href="http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux" target="_self">www.sony.net/Products/Linux</a>. Myself, I was surprised to find my
new digital camera on that list. Now if only we could turn this into some
sort of quality label instead of a hidden feature. (Disclaimer: I am a
UNIX sysadmin working for Sony.)

I'm surprised the article [Dan Sawyer's &ldquo;Must-Have Firefox
Extensions&rdquo; in the June 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>] didn't even mention AdBlock Plus. It's the
first extension I put on any Firefox installation I come across. After I
installed it on my girlfriend's laptop, she exclaimed, &ldquo;now I understand why
you actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> that one site!&rdquo; Her laptop's running Kubuntu with
VMware Workstation for those pesky Windows-only apps, by the way.
</p><p>
Another helpful extension is Cookie Button, which prevents all those
cookie confirmation windows from popping up and still allows one to enable
them easily for a specific site if required.
</p><p>
I also enjoyed last month's article regarding using virtualization on Mac OS
X, because that's what I've been doing ever since I got my MacBook Pro [Dave
Taylor's &ldquo;Running Ubuntu as a Virtual OS in Mac OS X&rdquo; in the
May 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>]. It's
running Parallels with Kubuntu and Windows XP, and it allows me to develop
and test software on all three operating systems with ease.
</p><p>
And, I can run Amarok to listen to music, because iTunes simply doesn't
measure up.
