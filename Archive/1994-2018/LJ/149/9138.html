Matrox Graphics' EpicA Graphics Cards</h2></div></div><p>
The team at Matrox Graphics recently released its EpicA series of dual-
and quad-display PCI graphics cards intended for thin clients and other
mission-critical systems.  According to Matrox, the products offer
&ldquo;innovative, new, server-based software...to manage multi-display
configurations in remote sessions&rdquo;.  Supported protocols include Linux
desktop remote connection software, Microsoft RDP and Citrix ICA for
Windows.  Other features include passive cooling, small form factor,
support for digital and analog monitors, low power consumption and
independent and &ldquo;stretched&rdquo; modes.  The TC-2 and TC-2 Lite models
support two monitors concurrently, while the TC-4 model supports four.

DerEngel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking the Cable Modem</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
No Starch Press is a publisher with a penchant for finding geeky niches
that other publishers won't touch, and DerEngel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking the
Cable Modem</em></span> is a fine case in point.  This book &ldquo;reveals secrets of many popular cable
modems, including products from Motorola, RCA, WebSTAR, D-Link and
more&rdquo;,
sayeth the No Starchers.  It is also a guide to hacking a cable modem,
installing new firmware, unblocking ports and unlocking hidden features.
One net benefit of these efforts, besides pure hacking enjoyment of
course, is an increase in bandwidth up to 20-fold.  In addition, who
wouldn't be curious to know what the author, whose alias is DerEngel
(&ldquo;the
angel&rdquo; in German) and has been tagged as &ldquo;the underground Prometheus
of super-broadband&rdquo;, has lurking in his brain.  The product will be
on real and virtual bookshelves in August 2006.

Wingware's WingIDE 2.1</h2></div></div><p>
Wingware is now shipping release 2.1 of WingIDE, its development
environment for Guido van Rossum's masterpiece, the Python programming
language.  WingIDE's purpose is to provide &ldquo;powerful debugging, editing,
code intelligence and search capabilities that reduce development
and debugging time, cut down on coding errors, and make it easier to
understand and navigate Python code&rdquo;.  New features in version 2.1
include Visual Studio, VI/Vim and brief key bindings, Subversion
and Perforce support, improved Windows performance, named bookmarks,
breakpoint manager and call stack as list, file evaluation or selection
in the Python Shell and support for Macs on Intel.  Supported platforms
include recent Intel Linux systems, Windows 2000 and later and OS X
10.3.9 or later (with X11 installed).  Solaris, *BSD and other Posix
platforms are supported for those willing to compile from source code.
A free trial is available on Wingware's Web site.

Novell's SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 First Class Course</h2></div></div><p>
First there was toast on a stick (vintage David Letterman reference),
and now Novell offers training on a stick too! SUSE Linux Enterprise
10 First Class is a new, self-contained course on a USB drive that
allows users to test the new server and desktop products on their own.
Included on the multiplatform (Linux, Windows) device are both the
learning content and an installed example of the server and desktop on a
virtual machine.  Novell states that this approach &ldquo;gives the student a
unique environment to study the lecture and then gain hands-on experience
using the virtual machine to do exercises&rdquo;.  Students can utilize the
course themselves or use it as part of an instructor-led two-day course
at various training centers.  The course/device hybrid is available for
purchase at Novell's Web site.

VariCAD 2005 3.0</h2></div></div><p>
VariCAD has significantly rebuilt its eponymous 3-D/2-D mechanical CAD
system&mdash;which is no stranger to the Linux platform&mdash;with
release 3.0.  At its heart, says VariCAD, the multiplatform (Linux,
Windows) product is a fully loaded package that offers not only
&ldquo;powerful tools for 3-D modeling and 2-D drafting and
dimensioning&rdquo;, but
also &ldquo;libraries of standard mechanical parts (ANSI, DIN), calculations
of standard mechanical components and tools for working with bills
of materials and blocks&rdquo;.  Innovations in the new version include
&ldquo;improvements in the STEP interface allowing input and output of 3-D
objects, new high-resolution bitmap output from 3-D, new user-defined
default settings, improved file opening and dimensioning&rdquo; and others.
A Linux-specific improvement is reduced dependence on system files,
allowing the software to run on more distros.  A free trial version
(Debian or RPM) is available for download from VariCAD's Web site.

Arcom's SBC-GX533 Development Kit</h2></div></div><p>
Arcom recently released its SBC-GX533 Development Kit for developing
embedded devices in a Linux environment.  The target applications,
says Arcom, are &ldquo;deeply embedded, remote or unattended installations
demanding reasonable processing power&rdquo;, typically industrial RTUs and
data acquisition modules, as well as networking and communications
devices.  The SBC-GX533 is a low-profile, fanless, RoHS-compliant,
EBX-form-factor board with a 400MHz AMD Geode GX533 1.1W processor, 512MB of DDR DRAM and 32MB of Flash, of which only 13MB are occupied by
the preloaded Linux image.  The Linux OS is kernel 2.6 with a Compressed
Journaled Flash File System (JFFS2) for reliability and recovery from
power interruptions.  One of the SBC-GX533's key advantages is the
preconfiguration of the Linux image, which preempts the need to
build it from scratch.  A few of the optional features are TFT, analog
touchscreen and Java Technology.

Supermicro Computer's X7 Series Server Platforms</h2></div></div><p>
Like other vendors in the diverse hardware arena, Supermicro has upgraded
its product line to take advantage of Intel's new Dual-Core Xeon 5100
series processors, aka Woodcrest.  The new platform is slated to
improve system performance and memory capacity, as well as reduce energy
consumption and operating temperatures.  Supermicro has leveraged Intel's
advances to improve its own systems, or SuperServers, that are based on
its X7 series of motherboards.  Supermicro claims that the combination of
its high-efficiency power supplies and the Woodcrest processors result in
&ldquo;5% or greater efficiency than competitors' systems&rdquo;,
providing energy
savings of &ldquo;up to $200 per server over three years&rdquo;.
