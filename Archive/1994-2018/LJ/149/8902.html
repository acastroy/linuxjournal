64-bit Linux represents a milestone in JMP statistical computing history.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x22f2298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The world's largest privately owned software company, SAS, was cofounded
in 1976 by Dr James Goodnight and John Sall.  They continue to run
the company as CEO and Executive Vice President.  Sall is also chief
architect of SAS's statistical discovery software called JMP (pronounced
&ldquo;jump&rdquo;), which he invented for the Macintosh in the late 1980s.  It is
a desktop statistical analysis program using exploratory graphics to
promote statistical discovery.  JMP was released for Windows in 1995 and
has been available for 32-bit Linux since 2003.
</p><p>
SAS's version 6.1 release of JMP later in 2006 harnesses the vast
computational power of 64-bit Linux, which is not only exciting news
for JMP and Linux, but is also a milestone in statistical computing.
</p><p>
To understand the importance of a 64-bit version of JMP, let us
contemplate the purpose and history of statistical analysis.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x22f24a8"></a>
Statistics Simplified</h2></div></div><p>
Ultimately, the purpose of statistics is to make sense out of too much
information.  For example, the only possible way to digest the results
of the United States census data every ten years, with its dozens of
measurements on 275-million people, is by reducing it to statistical
conclusions, such as the average household income by county and median age
by city or neighborhood.  Nobody could possibly look at the raw census
data and draw a meaningful conclusion beyond &ldquo;the United States has a
large, diverse population&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The problem is that there are hundreds and thousands of statistical
measures&mdash;in fact, SAS has already spent 30 years extending and refining
its analytical capabilities and doesn't see any end in sight.  Learning
what techniques to use for which real-world situations can take years,
and developing the insights to proceed effectively from raw data to
knowledge can take a lifetime.  This is what led John Sall to develop
JMP in the late 1980s.  Inspired by the way the Macintosh made desktop
computing accessible to a whole new audience by introducing a graphical
user interface, Sall realized he could make statistics accessible to a
wider audience by making the analysis process visual.
</p><p>
Comprehending the meaning buried in pages of statistical test
results&mdash;p-values, standard deviations, error terms, degrees of freedom and on
and on&mdash;is a mind-boggling task even for experts, but Sall knew that
just about anyone could look at a well-drawn graph and understand things
about his or her data.  JMP always leads every analysis with graphs, so
that researchers needn't waste time poring over statistics when those
graphs make it intuitively obvious whether they are on the right analysis
path or not.  JMP also groups related analyses together and presents them
in the order a researcher would need them in the course of a sound data
exploration process.  Researchers do not have to wrack their brains to
remember which procedure might be helpful next.  Instead, JMP provides the
tools that are appropriate at each stage.  Further, all of JMP's graphs and
data tables are dynamically linked, so that users can point and click to
select points in a graph or bars in a histogram and instantly see where
those points are represented in all other open graphs and data tables.

A Calculating Idea</h2></div></div><p>
Setting aside for a moment what it takes to understand statistics,
consider what it takes to calculate statistics.  For a researcher to
compute a standard deviation on thousands of observations using only a
pencil and paper could take weeks or months.
</p><p>
When he created SAS in the early 1970s, Jim Goodnight's idea was to store
all that data in a file and then write procedures that could be used
and reused to compute statistics on any file.  It's an idea that seems
ludicrously simple today, but it was revolutionary at the time.  The
agricultural scientists using SAS could perform calculations over and
over again on new data without having to pay for computer scientists to
write and rewrite programs.  Instead of taking weeks, these computations
took hours.  Fast-forward 30 years, and modern statistical software can
do these calculations on hundreds of thousands of rows, instantaneously.
</p><p>
When it took months to compute simple descriptive stats, researchers
often didn't get much further before they'd burned through their grant
money.  Now that the basics take seconds, researchers can dig much deeper,
and thus the science and practice of statistics have evolved along with
computing power.

64-bit Linux Empowers JMP to Solve Problems of Greater Magnitude</h2></div></div><p>
For the last decade, desktop computing has been built on operating
systems such as Windows, Linux and Mac that rely on 32-bit memory
addressing.  Accordingly, desktop applications have operated within the
computational limits implied by this architecture.  In practical terms,
this meant statistical programs like JMP that load the entire dataset
into RAM before performing any computations were limited to about a
million rows of data.  They couldn't handle the large-scale problems
confronting researchers today.  Geneticists are probing 3-billion base
pairs of DNA.  Semiconductor manufacturers are squeezing millions of
transistors onto ever-tinier chips.  Pharmaceutical companies comb through
thousands of potentially therapeutic properties on countless known and
theoretical compounds.

Dr Richard C. Potter, Director of Research and Development for JMP
Product Engineering, was responsible for porting JMP from Macintosh
to Windows and later from Windows to Linux, in collaboration with
Paul Nelson, lead Linux System Developer.  Potter says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
JMP's 64-bit
Linux release lifts this limit dramatically.  Now JMP can move beyond
the confines of the 32-bit addressing memory limit to a theoretical
limit of 16 exabytes, which would allow JMP to work on two-billion
rows of data.  The 64-bit Linux release of JMP is also multithreaded,
and the size and complexity of the problems someone can solve using JMP
is mind-boggling.

Design of Experiments Revolutionized the Science of Statistics</h2></div></div><p>
One particular analytical strength of JMP sets it clearly apart from
all other stats packages, open source or otherwise: its capabilities for
design of experiment (DOE).  The idea of experimental design goes beyond
the traditional statistical concept of trying to learn from data that
has already been collected, to an idea of planning how best to learn
more by designing and running experiments.
</p><p>
Suppose you make tires by cooking various ingredients into rubber,
combining that rubber with steel and other materials, then forming
the rubber into tire-shaped molds of various dimensions and tread
patterns.  You might judge the success of those tires by measuring
their traction in a variety of driving conditions, the range of
operating temperatures and speeds they can endure, and the length of
their usable lifetimes.  You would be attempting to solve an impossibly
complex problem.  You would be trying to optimize at least four response
measurements of varying importance and interactions that depend on an
infinitely variable mixture of ingredients and countless combinations
of cooking temperatures and times, molding pressures and times,
tire dimensions and tread patterns.  If you tried to optimize this
manufacturing process using traditional methods, trying out every
imaginable combination, you would be working for centuries and
expending more natural resources than you could hope to collect.
</p><p>
Design of experiments offers a better way.  By running a representative set
of experiments that span the space of possibilities and using statistical
modeling methods to interpolate and extrapolate those results, researchers
can reduce the size of problems to something manageable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x22f3370"></a>
The Next Level of Design of Experiments</h2></div></div><p>
The problem is that analysts always had to leaf through books searching
for a design model that resembled the problem they were trying to
solve.  In practice, they would have to use a model that was sort of like
their problem, that sort of handled their conditions and that sort of
modeled the behaviors of their system.  To make matters worse, most of
these &ldquo;canned designs&rdquo; required huge numbers of runs.  If a run costs a
few cents and takes minutes, that's no problem, but if your experiment
involves building or changing a multimillion-dollar semiconductor
fabrication complex or shutting down a thousand-unit-per-minute assembly
line, you cannot hope to do all the runs it would take to get meaningful
results.
</p><p>
JMP takes DOE to a whole new level by providing unique, powerful
custom design capabilities.  Researchers can describe their problem
precisely and fully, and JMP can determine smaller numbers of runs
that will be sufficient.  JMP's unique graphical factor profilers
enable researchers to explore the result space over any combination of
responses and factors and ultimately maximize desirabilities for their
entire system in seconds.  JMP's DOE has allowed blue-chip customers to
discover million-dollar annual savings or profit opportunities in mere
weeks.  As Bradley Jones, Senior Manager of Statistical Development and
chief architect of JMP's DOE capability, says, &ldquo;Of all the statistical
methods invented in the last 100 years, design of experiments is the
most cost-beneficial.&rdquo;

64-Bit Linux Powers JMP's Latest Innovations</h2></div></div><p>
But JMP's unique power in areas, such as design of experiments and its
newly introduced restricted maximum likelihood estimation of general
linear models, are computationally intensive in the extreme.  With JMP's
new multithreaded architecture running on a 64-bit dual processor,
experimental designs that once took several days to compute can now be
calculated in minutes.  And, problems that were impossible only last year
can now be handled in minutes with 64-bit Linux JMP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x22f3688"></a>
Porting JMP to 64-Bit Addressing</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;When porting a 32-bit application to 64 bits, there are certain pitfalls
you are likely to encounter&rdquo;, says Potter.  He continues:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The complexity is compounded
if you support not only Linux but Windows and Macintosh as well, as
we do with JMP.  The key thing to remember is that in the 64-bit Linux
architecture, pointers and longs are both 64-bits wide, while an int
remains 32 bits.  This breaks any code that assumes a pointer can be
stored in an int.
</p><p>
If you have source code compiled on both Linux and Windows, you must be
extra careful.  Although it's perfectly legal to store a pointer in a long
on 64-bit Linux, converting a pointer to a long won't work on Windows,
where a long is still only 32-bits wide.  On Windows any 64-bit pointers
will have to be converted to long longs instead.
</p><p>
Until now floating-point operations on PowerPC
for Macintosh used a 64-bit long double, but that may change in the
future.  PowerPC-based Macs use the &ldquo;LP64&rdquo; model in 64-bit executables,
meaning that longs and pointers are 64-bit, just as they are on
Linux.  Apple has not yet announced a 64-bit strategy for Intel-based Macs.
</p><p>
Finally, although graphical user interface APIs are
available to 64-bit applications on Linux and Windows, the Macintosh
GUIs are not.  Of course, you can separate your application into a 32-bit
GUI that communicates with a 64-bit kernel, as Wolfram Research did with
64-bit Mathematica.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Nelson observed that porting JMP to 64 bits went smoothly.  &ldquo;The only issue
was locating the few places where our code made assumptions about 32-bit
word and pointer sizes&rdquo;, says Nelson.  &ldquo;There were no surprises from the
tools used for the port, either.  Much of the ease in porting is due to the
long heritage on 64-bit UNIX platforms of the open-source tools we
used.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;The GNU Compiler Collection, gdb, Emacs and the rest of the toolchain
performed as expected on the x86_64 architecture&rdquo;, says Nelson.

JMP or Open-Source Alternatives?</h2></div></div><p>
Besides JMP, the only statistical software available on the Linux desktop
today is an open-source product called R.  It has considerable analytical
depth and its open-source nature allows statisticians who also have
computer programming talent to extend R.  However, for the vast majority
of people working in statistics today, JMP is generally acknowledged
to be a better choice.  JMP has an intuitive graphical user interface,
a broad range of deep analytical capabilities and comprehensive
professionally written documentation.  JMP customers have the confidence
that their investment is backed by SAS's award-winning, PhD-staffed
quality assurance, technical support and professional training and
consulting services.  SAS boasts a 30-year record of continuous growth,
so JMP customers know they can count on SAS and JMP to be around for
the long haul.

What's Next for Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;People keep wondering if Linux will ever be a serious contender in
the desktop market&rdquo;, says Potter.  &ldquo;It's been disappointing to Linux
enthusiasts that this hasn't yet happened.  Now, with the availability of
affordable 64-bit desktop machines, we might start to see that
change&rdquo;,
Potter says.  He continues:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
From the server perspective, the Linux operating system is generally
recognized to be more reliable and secure at a lower cost of ownership
than the alternatives.
</p><p>
Many research scientists and
engineers would have liked to adopt Linux on their desktops too.  They
have refrained from doing so, however, because the applications they
depended upon and the computing power they needed simply weren't
there.  Now those obstacles are gone.
</p><p>
As more of the applications that researchers depend upon, like JMP,
become available for 64-bit Linux, its share of the desktop market can
only grow.
