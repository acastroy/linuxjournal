Exploring proprietary software and piracy.

&ldquo;maddog, maddog&rdquo;, came the voices.  Of course, I knew what this
meant;
it was the weekly meeting of the Pollywogs, a group of young friends who
wanted to learn more about the history of computers.  They came to the
small restaurant where I had dinner on Saturday evenings, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Alideia
dos Piratas</em></span>, to ask questions and receive the best answers that I could give.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Boa noite&rdquo;, I said (being most of the Portuguese I know),
&ldquo;what can I do for
you tonight?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell us about pirates&rdquo;, they answered
in unison.  &ldquo;Pirates?&rdquo; I
questioned, &ldquo;this seems a little off subject...you normally are interested in
computer information, why this interest in pirates?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Software pirates&rdquo;, they
answered, and now I saw the connection.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What most people call software piracy is a complex
issue&rdquo;, I said.  I continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In the
earliest days of computers, both hardware and software were incredibly
expensive.  The people who could afford the hardware of the computers
also usually could afford the cost of the software.  Likewise, software was
typically created as a service for the customer.  Manufacturers supplied the
operating system software for their own computer systems, so their
customers could use their hardware, and applications were written specifically
for a particular customer as a service.  When customers
&ldquo;bought&rdquo; software,
usually the license did not specify how many computers they could run it on,
and customers &ldquo;owned&rdquo; the software they had purchased.
</p><p>
As time went on and computers became manufactured in larger quantities, the
price of hardware dropped considerably, but software remained expensive.
So, people thought about manufacturing software the same way they manufactured
hardware.  This software typically would be delivered only in binary form, at
a fraction of the cost, but you would not own the software, just the right to
use it under terms of a license.  The creator of the software still
&ldquo;owned&rdquo;
it.  This is what most people are used to in today's market.
</p><p>
Although this was adequate for a lot of the world's market, it had some artificial
limitations.  Depending on the license, restrictions were made as to whether the
software could be re-sold or re-used.  Although older hardware might be re-sold
to people who could not afford to buy new hardware, the old software could
not be re-sold.  Ironically, repopulating an old computer system with fresh
copies of the software it originally came with might cost more than buying
a new computer with the software already &ldquo;bundled&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Andr&eacute; gave me a knowing look.  He told the group about his grandmother
who was given a used computer, but it had no software on it.  The person
giving it to her had stripped the software off, to be
&ldquo;legal&rdquo;.  The software
alone would have cost her $2,000 US to replace, just to do simple word
processing and some manipulation of her digital camera pictures.  His
grandmother was now a &ldquo;software pirate&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
As the prices of the hardware dropped, the prices of the
commercial software necessary to &ldquo;do business on the Internet&rdquo; stayed
the same or even went up.  While new computer systems with high-speed CPUs,
lots of memory and disk space dropped in price to hundreds of US dollars, the
software to run them stayed the same or rose in price to thousands of
dollars.
</p><p>
It is interesting to note that commerce has moved in time from viewing the
computer as a luxury in business to a necessity in business.  It is difficult,
if not impossible, for a business to exist without using computers and/or
being tied to the Internet.  Yet for people whose monthly income was measured
in tens of dollars, this meant they could not afford the computers
they were told they needed to do business today.
</p><p>
Enter software piracy.  When caught between the proverbial rock and the hard
place, people started to copy software and distribute it to people who needed
it.  People realized it did not cost $600 US to make a shiny
plastic disk and that they could get the equivalent disk at their local CD
store for $2 US.  I mentioned that one time at a conference and a
voice from the back of the room said, &ldquo;One US Dollar!&rdquo;, a tough
negotiator.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, this copying and selling of the software is illegal, and it is against
the wishes expressed in the license as well as (in most cases) against the
wishes of the software creator.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;It is as wrong as stealing a bicycle or a car, or photocopying a book for
re-sale.  It teaches a disrespect for the law that filters down to other
issues&rdquo;, said Pablo.  Pablo is studying to be a doctor, but is also active
in his Software Livre! club.  He went on to say, &ldquo;In addition, stolen software
does not typically allow for the thief to go back to the creator of the
software to ask for patches, extentions or training.  And there is no pride in
stealing software.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Why don't companies do more to protect their software?&rdquo; asked one of the
members of the group.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Ironically, companies who scream the loudest about software piracy often
admit to encouraging it&rdquo;, I said, and continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A South American product manager of a
large software company based in Redmond, Washington, once admitted to me that
they &ldquo;help out&rdquo; people that they know have pirated their software, providing
patches and information to them.  &ldquo;It keeps these people from using
alternatives&rdquo;, he told me.  Yet, in the same country, this company is an active
member of the Business Software Alliance, which often audits companies to see
whether they are using unlicensed software and oversees the legal actions against
them.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The group agreed that this seemed more than a little hypocritical.
</p><p>
Cesar told us that this same Redmond-based company often provides
&ldquo;free&rdquo;
distribution for &ldquo;Education&rdquo; or &ldquo;Digital
Divide&rdquo; reasons.  The latest edition
of this software can run only three applications at a time, and other similar
restrictions makes their software even more useless.  &ldquo;The motivation
behind this is so transparent, it is enough to make a person laugh or cry.
They hope to keep the buyer of the computer from trying a truly free operating
system and software&rdquo;, he said.
</p><p>
Pablo pointed out that free software cannot be stolen.  &ldquo;You cannot steal
something that is licensed to you freely.  There may be a request with the
free software that you acknowledge the person or company that wrote it, but
this is typically a low- or no-cost request, easily done.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Finally, I said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Free (free as in freedom)
software, allows people with
little money to help contribute to the software in many ways.  They can
contribute to the development, to the documentation, to the testing or to the
promotion of the software.  They even can sell support and training, making
a living off of it, instead of a drain.  They do not have to worry about the
Business Software Alliance.  This means that people who have little money
still can contribute to the advancement of the software they use.  They can
join the software community with pride, not as a handout, and not as a
thief.
</p><p>
Although you think I may be talking only about so-called third-world
countries,
how many businesses anywhere have &ldquo;enough&rdquo; money?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Marlon told us about his uncle who needed several pieces of very expensive
software, available only from the United States and available only in
English to run his business.  The software would have cost him more than $2 million
US, but more important, it would have forced him to teach his employees
enough English to use the software.  Instead, his uncle found a free software
programmer who duplicated exactly what the uncle's business needed using MySQL,
Perl, FreeGIS, Apache and other free software products.  His uncle paid the
software programmer money to create the software needed, and the software
worked in Portuguese, not English.  The money also stayed locally, buying
local food, local housing and paying local taxes.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;Enough talk about software pirates and software piracy.
If you do not start your football game now, it will be too dark!&rdquo;
</p><p>
And while the younger Pollywogs went off to play their game on the sand, the
older ones and I put on our jackets, watching the sun drop down behind the
trees and the stars come out over the water.
