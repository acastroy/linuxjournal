Extending the Maypole Soccer Club Database System with a simple Web-based
reporting mechanism.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd83348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the March 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, I used
Maypole to create a Web-based database application in
only 18 lines of Perl code.  The functionality provided
by Maypole is impressive except in one important
area: reporting.  Consequently, I started to research
technologies for producing reports from my Soccer
Club system.  My goal was to provide a set of standard
reports that could be executed from a Web interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd834a8"></a>
Web Reporting? What to Do?</h2></div></div><p>
Web reports can be produced in a lot of ways using any of the many
server-side programming technologies, such as PHP, JSPs, Perl scripts and
the like.  Standalone desktop reporting tools also are available, and it's even
possible to use OpenOffice.org to report on a MySQL database.  As my reporting
requirements are basic, however, I wanted to keep my intellectual
effort to the minimum.  What I didn't mind doing was spending time
crafting the SQL queries that I'd need to produce my reports.  Once
written, I wanted my SQL query to produce an HTML table of results.
</p><p>
I can do this with Perl, of course, using the DBI and DBD::mysql
modules, hand-crafting program code to send the query to the database.  I
then could post-process the results with more code, before&mdash;ultimately&mdash;writing
yet more code to create the table.  For my simple requirements, this felt like too much work.  What I really wanted was a
quick-and-dirty solution.  In the remainder of this article, I detail the
Web reporting solution I designed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd83608"></a>
MySQL to the Rescue!</h2></div></div><p>
While browsing Paul DuBois' excellent <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL Cookbook</em></span>, I discovered
a command-line option for turning the results of a command-line query
into an HTML table (recipe 1.23, page 33).  By way of example, consider
the following command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mysql  -e  "select name from player"              \
    -u  manager  -ppwhere  CLUB

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd837c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which produces the following textual output when invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+-------------+
|name         |
+-------------+
|Robert Plant |
|Tim Finn     |
|James Taylor |
|Bryan Adams  |
|Ian Gillen   |
|Mick Jagger  |
|Neil Young   |
|Bob Dylan    |
+-------------+
</pre>
</p><p>
These results not only show the names of all of the players in the Soccer
Club database, but they also appear to indicate that the club's players are
named after some famous folk and rock singers.  When re-run with
the HTML creation option, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mysql  -H  -e  "select name from player"          \
    -u  manager  -ppwhere  CLUB

</pre>
</p><p>
the above command line produces the following, which, trust me,
is an HTML table:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;TABLE BORDER=1&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;name&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;
Robert Plant&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Tim Finn&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;James Taylor&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Bryan Adams
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Ian Gillen&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;
Mick Jagger&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Neil Young&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible to put the SQL query into a file and then refer to the file on
the command line.  For example&mdash;and assuming the above query is in a file
called name.sql&mdash;this command line produces the same HTML table:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mysql  -H  -u  manager  -ppwhere  CLUB  &lt;  name.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
Knowing this much, I figured that if I could come up with a means of
issuing the HTML-producing command line from a Web interface, I'd be
most of the way toward providing my Web reporting solution.  So, I wrote
a small CGI script in Perl to execute the command line for me.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd83b88"></a>
The CGI Script</h2></div></div><p>
The strategy employed by my simple CGI script is straightforward:
after determining the name of the query to execute, a command line is
constructed and then issued by the CGI script.  Any results produced from
executing the command line are put inside the body part of the HTML page
that the CGI script produces.
</p><p>
After the usual Perl startup lines, the runquery.cgi script starts
by defining a series of constant values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

use constant MYSQL  =&gt; '/usr/bin/mysql';
use constant USERID =&gt; 'manager';
use constant PASSWD =&gt; 'pwhere';
use constant DBNAME =&gt; 'CLUB';
</pre>
</p><p>
The location for the MySQL client on your computer may be
different from where I have mine, so change the MYSQL constant value if
need be.  Also, note that I'm hard-coding the values for the database
user (USERID), the password (PASSWD) and the database that is to be
queried against (DBNAME).  Although this may not be the best practice, I
am going to explain it away by saying that this is the dirty part of my
quick-and-dirty solution.  With the constants defined, I indicate that I'm
going to use the standard interface to Perl's CGI programming technology:

<pre     class="programlisting">
use CGI qw( :standard );
</pre>
</p><p>
Two Perl scalars then are defined, taking their value from any parameters
passed from a Web interface to the CGI script.  The first parameter, called
query, identifies the SQL file to use, while the second, called
title, provides a report title to use when displaying results:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $query = param( 'query' );
my $title = param( 'title' );
</pre>
</p><p>
The script then creates the command line that runs the query through
the MySQL client program.  Note that Perl's dot operator is used to
concatenate strings:

<pre     class="programlisting">

my $cmdline = MYSQL .
              ' -H -u ' .
              USERID .
              ' -p' .
              PASSWD .
              ' ' .
              DBNAME .
              "&lt; $query ";

</pre>
</p><p>
The script then starts to build an HTML page.  The header function
generates the correct Content-Type header, and the start_html
function starts to create the HTML page using the value provided for
the page's title:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print header;
print start_html( -title =&gt; $title );
</pre>
</p><p>
The next line of code uses Perl's qx operator to execute the
command line and return any resulting output from its execution to a
variable, called $results:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $results = qx/ $cmdline /;
</pre>
</p><p>
The rest of the script adds an HTML level 3 heading to the Web page,
together with the query results and an HTML link to the reports page.  The
end_html function finishes the HTML page generation and concludes
the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

print "&lt;h3&gt;$title&lt;/h3&gt;";

print $results;

print p, "Return to the ",
      a( { -href =&gt; "/Club/Reports.html" },
      "List of Reports" );

print end_html;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd84160"></a>
Invoking the Script</h2></div></div><p>
To run the script, you need to do two things: put the script in a place
where your Web server can find it and put an SQL query into a
file.  On
my Fedora Core 3 system running Apache 2, the /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory
is used to hold the Web server's CGI scripts.  So, I simply copy the CGI
script into that location and make it executable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp  runquery.cgi  /var/www/cgi-bin/
chmod  +x  /var/www/cgi-bin/runquery.cgi
</pre>
</p><p>
The above directory may not be the location used by your
distribution for Web pages, so be sure to check first.  As for a query,
here's the contents of the file conditions.sql:

<pre     class="programlisting">
select player.name as 'Player',
       condition.name as 'Medical Condition'
from   player, condition
where  player.medical_condition = condition.id and
       player.medical_condition != 1;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above SQL query joins the player and condition tables
in order to list the names of each player together with his medical
condition, assuming he has one.  This query file also needs to be
copied to the CGI directory on the Web server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp  conditions.sql  /var/www/cgi-bin/
</pre>
</p><p>
To execute the query from the CGI script, type the following into your
browser's address bar, substituting <tt  >localhost</tt> with the name of your
Web server:

<pre     class="programlisting">

http://localhost/cgi-bin/runquery.cgi?            \
          title=Results&amp;query=conditions.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
This URL produces the output shown in Figure 1, which, despite being a
little plain, looks okay&mdash;but it could be nicer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8281f1.large.jpg"><img src="8281f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd84738"></a>
Making Things Look Nicer with CSS</h2></div></div><p>
To produce a report with an improved look and feel, I created a small
cascading style sheet (CSS), called reports.css, to improve the
general appearance of the produced report:

<pre     class="programlisting">
body {
    font-family:       sans-serif;
}

table {
    font-family:       sans-serif;
    background-color:  LIGHTYELLOW;
}

table th {
    background-color:  LIGHTCYAN;
    font-size:         75%;
}

h3 {
    font-family:       sans-serif;
    color:             BLUE;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As stylesheets go, mine is pretty simple.  I declare a
font for the text in my main body and then I fiddle with
the font and background color of any tables that I put
on my HTML page.  The table headings are shown at
75% of the user's normal text size with a different
background color from the data in the table.  I then
declare that my level 3 headings are colored blue.
</p><p>
The CSS file needs to be copied into the Web server's root directory so
that my Web pages can find it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp  reports.css  /var/www/html
</pre>
</p><p>
To use the CSS file, I changed the print start_html line from
runquery.cgi to refer to the stylesheet, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print start_html( -title =&gt; $title,
                  -style =&gt; { -src =&gt; "/reports.css" } );
</pre>
</p><p>
Reloading the query produces the output shown in Figure 2.  It may
not win me a Web design award, but it does look a whole lot better than
the plain results shown in Figure 1.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd84c60"></a>
Creating the Web Interface</h2></div></div><p>
This part of my solution was easy.  All I needed was a simple Web page
describing a list of reports.  As with the generated reports, I use my
simple stylesheet to improve the look of the reports page.  Here's the
HTML I used:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;Soccer Club Reporting System&lt;/TITLE&gt;
    &lt;LINK rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="/reports.css" /&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H3&gt;Soccer Club Reporting System&lt;/H3&gt;
Choose from one of these reports:
&lt;OL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;List players that have a
    &lt;a href="/cgi-bin/runquery.cgi?
    title=Players with a Medical Condition&amp;
    query=conditions.sql"&gt;Medical Conditions&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;List all players,
    &lt;a href="/cgi-bin/runquery.cgi?
    title=Listing of all Players (Youngest First)&amp;
    query=desc_dob.sql"&gt;youngest first&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
Return to the &lt;A HREF="/Club"&gt;Soccer Club&lt;/A&gt;
database system.
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As shown above, each report is executed with two parameters: title,
which provides a report description, and query, which identifies
the SQL query file to run through MySQL.  With my Web page created,
I copied it into the root directory of the Soccer Club Web site:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp  Reports.html  /var/www/html/Club/
</pre>
</p><p>
When loaded into a Web browser, the reporting Web interface looks like
that shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8281f3.large.jpg"><img src="8281f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  The Reporting Web Interface
</p></div></div><p>
At this point, I think I'm done.  I have a simple Web interface to a
standard report producing mechanism.  If I write more queries, I can put
them into their own SQL query file, copy the file to my cgi-bin
directory and update my HTML reports Web page to invoke the query as
required.  My solution is quick-and-dirty and more than good enough.
</p><p>
Or is it?
</p><p>
The security of my solution is very, very poor.  I need to worry about
two things, protecting my CGI script and SQL query files from user
tampering and protecting my system from the CGI script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd7ba18"></a>
Security: Protection from User Tampering</h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to tampering with the CGI script and SQL query files, the
problem is&mdash;by default&mdash;all of the files can be read by any user
logged in to the system that runs the Web server; a simple cat or
less command would do the trick.  Any user can look inside runquery.cgi and display the
user ID and password used in accessing the database, which is not good.
</p><p>
The User and Group directives in the Apache httpd.conf
configuration file indicate which user and group the Apache Web
server runs under.  On my computer, this user and group is set to
apache.  Knowing this, I issued the following commands to ensure
that the contents of my CGI script and SQL query files are owned by the
apache user and that they can be read from and written to only
by the same apache user.  This stops any other user&mdash;except root,
of course&mdash;from examining their contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd  /var/www/cgi-bin
chown  apache:apache  *
chmod  600  *
chmod  700  *.cgi
</pre>
</p><p>
The first chmod command ensures the files in the cgi-bin directory can
be read from and written to solely by the apache user.  The second
chmod command switches on the executable bit for any CGI scripts,
but only for the owner of the file.  With these simple precautions,
my solution is now safe from user tampering.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd7bc28"></a>
Security: Protection from the CGI Script</h2></div></div><p>
The above chmod command lines protect the files from other users logged
in to the system, but my solution still is vulnerable.  Unfortunately,
it is open to exploitation by any user with access to the Web server
by way of any Web browser.  For example, consider what happens if
the following URL is sent to the CGI script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

http://localhost/cgi-bin/runquery.cgi?            \
title=Ha!&amp;query=conditions.sql | cat runquery.cgi

</pre>
</p><p>
The contents of the CGI script appear in the browser, and the issuer
easily can read the database name, the user ID and password contained within
the file.  This is bad enough, but imagine if the <tt  >cat
runquery.cgi</tt>
pipe in the above URL is replaced with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat  /etc/passwd
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8b580.0xd7be90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or the potentially disastrous:

<pre     class="programlisting">

rm  -rf  /

</pre>
</p><p>
The problem with the CGI script as written is it blindly trusts the
issuer not to fiddle with the URL.  By simply adding the pipe symbol and
any other shell command line to the URL, the issuer exploits this poorly
designed CGI script, effectively executing other commands of the issuer's
choosing on the Web server.  By passing the query string unaltered
to the operating system to execute, the CGI script makes it far too easy
for such a vulnerability to be exploited.
</p><p>
Thankfully, Perl has a special mode of operation that can help, and it
is called taint mode.  Most any book on Perl describes taint mode,
and the second edition of Christiansen and Torkington's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
Cookbook</em></span> provides a handy primer (recipe 19.4, page 767).  By turning on taint mode,
the Perl interpreter is instructed not to trust data that originates
outside the script.  As the data is not trusted&mdash;it's
&ldquo;tainted&rdquo;&mdash;Perl won't let you use the data in an unsafe
way without raising a run-time exception.
</p><p>
I can turn on Perl's tainting technology by changing the first line
of my CGI script to include the taint mode switch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/perl -wT
</pre>
</p><p>
When I reload the fiddled-with URL, the resulting HTML page is empty and
Apache's error_log has been appended with an insecure dependency
error.  This is Perl's way of telling me that the script failed due to
tainting errors.  Obviously, with the script failing in this way, it is
no longer a security threat to the system.  However, it also is no longer
doing what it was designed to do, which makes it all but unusable.  To
make the script usable again, we need to untaint the input data using
Perl's regular expression technology.  The idea is straightforward: by
defining a pattern representing safe data, the pattern can be applied
to the tainted data and&mdash;assuming the pattern matches&mdash;any results
are untainted and considered safe.  With the CGI script, there are two
data inputs, query and title.  I added the following regular
expressions to the CGI script to untaint the input data:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$query =~ /^([-\w]+\.sql)$/;
$query = $1;

$title =~ /^([\w:.?! ]+)$/;
$title = $1;

</pre>
</p><p>
The first regular expression matches on a string that has any combination
of hyphens or word characters, followed by a period and the letters s,
q and l.  Anything else doesn't match and is considered suspect.  If
a match does occur, Perl remembers the match in the $1 match-variable,
which then is assigned back to the now untainted $query.  With titles, the
pattern allows any combination of word characters and those characters
included within the square brackets of the regular expression.  Again,
the $title variable is untainted when a successful match occurs.
</p><p>
As the CGI script executes an external executable&mdash;namely, the MySQL
client&mdash;the environment's path also needs to be untainted.  This is
accomplished by setting the PATH variable within the environment to a
safe list of directories, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ENV{'PATH'} = "/usr/bin";
</pre>
</p><p>
With these changes made to the runquery.cgi script, it is usable
once more.  As well as being quick-and-dirty and safe from user tampering,
my solution is no longer a potential security threat to my system.

Integration with a Maypole Application</h2></div></div><p>
To link my simple reporting interface into my Soccer Club application,
I changed the custom/frontpage template to include an additional
list item that refers to the reporting Web page:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;ul&gt;
[% FOR table = config.display_tables %]
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;a href="[%table%]/list"&gt;Work with the
                               [%table %] data&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
[% END %]
    &lt;li&gt;Work with the &lt;a href="Reports.html"&gt;
                               Reports System&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
When the application is loaded into a browser, the link appears as
part of the initial Maypole menu, as shown in Figure 4.  My Web-based
reporting system is simple, safe and easily extended.  All I need to do
now is write some more SQL queries.
