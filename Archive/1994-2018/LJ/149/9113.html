<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #149, September 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

&ldquo;The kernel has <span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> mission in life, and one mission only. Guess what
that is? It's to be the buffer between user space and shared resources.
That's it. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.&rdquo;&mdash;Linus Torvalds
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has produced a shiny
new <span   class="bold"><b>device driver developer's kit</b></span>,
which he hopes will rival those available for other operating systems.
Distributed as a GPLed CD image, the kit contains a variety of source code
and documentation, including a full copy of the third edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Device Drivers</em></span>. Future versions will add a searchable index of all included
docs. There also is talk of incorporating the kernel news sections from
lwn.net into the mix. A lot of kernel folks are interested in seeing this
kit grow into something very powerful, and many of them have offered ideas
and suggestions. Undoubtedly, this project will accrue large numbers of
contributors and fill what has been a very large gap.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wedgwood</b></span> ran into a problem when attempting to unmark a few features
as &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; recently. The whole point of tagging a feature
experimental is, on the one hand, to protect users from inadvertently using
dangerous, unfinished features, and on the other hand, it is to allow them to
experiment with those features if they so choose. But with no clear
definition of when something should or should not be considered
experimental, kernel folks have been marking their projects as experimental
under all kinds of different circumstances. The result of this was that so
much completely usable code had been marked experimental, many users
just had to enable experimental by default in all their builds, thus
defeating the whole point of the feature. Typically what would happen now is
that folks would argue over which definition of experimental would be most
appropriate as the official definition. After a lengthy, bitter debate,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> would come up with
something that puts a whole different face
on the problem, and this would be refined in practice over months and years.
Will that happen in this case? Perhaps, but we just don't know.
</p><p>
Linux has apparently been out of compliance with <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX hostname lengths</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span> sent in a patch to correct this by raising the hard-coded limit
from 64 characters to 255, not counting the terminating null. Although Linus
Torvalds always has insisted that POSIX should not be blindly complied with,
and that Linux should first of all do the right thing regardless of official
standards, it does seem as though the hostname issue was a genuine
oversight,
and Randy's patch will go into the 2.6.17 kernel.
</p><p>
The current limit of five <span   class="bold"><b>nested symbolic
links</b></span> also is likely to be raised
to nine for the 2.6.17 release. <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander
Viro</b></span> had alerted folks back in
February 2006 that he would do this, and he submitted a patch to accomplish it
when the subject came up again more recently. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> gave his
reluctant approval to this, pointing out that this would not be a
backward-compatible change. Any application extended to rely on having more
than five nested links would be unable to run on older kernels with the smaller
limit. Given that it really was high time the five-nest limit was raised,
however, Andrew affirmed that 2.6.17 would be the right time to do it. And,
as some folks pointed out during the discussion, distributions like
<span   class="bold"><b>Red Hat</b></span>
had raised the limit to nine some time ago on their own.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jared Hulbert</b></span> has been working on a filesystem targeted at embedded
devices, specifically phones. <span   class="bold"><b>AXFS</b></span>
is short for Advanced XIP
Filesystem, and XIP is short for eXecute In Place. AXFS launches and runs
programs directly from their non-volatile storage location, instead of first
loading them into RAM. There are several benefits to this, and some
developers, such as <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lord</b></span>, already
have expressed serious interest in
using AXFS on real-live systems. One benefit of AXFS is that program
initiation may be faster without the overhead of copying the program code to
RAM. Another benefit derives from the fact that RAM-based systems typically
store their programs compressed in Flash. On execution, the programs are
uncompressed before being copied to RAM. With AXFS, programs would be stored
uncompressed, requiring more Flash for storage, but would do away with RAM
entirely, which could lower the overall cost of producing the device. AXFS
is not yet ready for prime time, as Jared has been quick to point out. His
main purpose in sharing his work so far has been to get opinions and
guidance from the kernel folks.

<h2 class="title">Driving to Domination</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #149, September 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux is a tortoise to the proprietary OS hares of the world. We all
know how the story goes, and we've watched it play out in servers and
embedded devices. (Still waiting on cell phones, but the turtle is
gaining there too.)
</p><p>
Desktops and laptops are another matter. In no race has the going been
slower for the tortoise, or its ultimate victory more inevitable, than
in the race to make personal computers ready to drive any device that
comes along. Lack of device drivers has always been blamed for slowing
Linux's march to world domination in desktops and laptops.
</p><p>
But Linux will win that one too. Why? Because Linux likes its drivers in
the kernel tree. There's no need to annoy the hacker and confuse the
user with a CD full of binary code and promotional lockware. Instead, you
write an LKM. Here's how the HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/x68.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/x68.html</a>) explains it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Some people think of LKMs as outside of the kernel. They speak of
LKMs communicating with the kernel. This is a mistake; LKMs (when
loaded) are very much part of the kernel. The correct term for the
part of the kernel that is bound into the image that you boot, i.e.,
all of the kernel except the LKMs, is &ldquo;base kernel&rdquo;; LKMs
communicate with the base kernel....
</p><p>
There is a tendency to think of LKMs like user-space programs. They
do share a lot of their properties, but LKMs definitely are not user-space programs. They are part of the kernel.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The HOWTO goes on to explain the many advantages of LKMs. Some big
hardware vendors have discovered those advantages too. At the Linux
Desktop Summit earlier this year, HP showed off how well its printers
&ldquo;just work&rdquo; with a Linux box.
</p><p>
Ah, but what if you're not HP? What's to stop you from developing a
device driver of your own?
</p><p>
Not much anymore. Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linux kernel subsystem maintainer,
author of the LKM HOWTO and co-author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device
Drivers</em></span>, 3rd
edition (O'Reilly, 2005), released a Device Driver Kit at FreedomHEC.
&ldquo;Have you felt left out of the crowd when looking at the 36 CD-ROM
package of documentation and example source code that other operating
systems provide for their developers? Well feel ashamed no longer!&rdquo; he
wrote. His version, in the Linux tradition, is comparatively minimal:
one CD image with what Greg says is &ldquo;everything that a Linux device
driver author would need in order to create Linux drivers&rdquo;. That
includes a full copy of Greg's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> book and pre-built
copies of all in-kernel docbook documentation. &ldquo;It even has a copy of
the Linux source code that you can directly build external kernel
modules against&rdquo;, Greg adds. The kit is based on the 2.6.16.18 kernel
release.

In his CES keynote in January 2006, Google cofounder Larry Page gave the
consumer electronics industry some well-deserved heat for producing
exclusive, incompatible and non-interoperable gear. Also, at the same
show, Google promoted a package of software products that ran only on
Windows. In the Q&amp;A, I pointed out this irony and asked what Google would
do to fix its own platform-exclusivity problems. Larry admitted that
this was &ldquo;a problem&rdquo;, and said they were working on fixing it.
</p><p>
We reported on one result&mdash;Picasa for Linux&mdash;last month. This
month,
we can report that Google Earth is also available for Linux as well. The
first iteration, just released at this writing (in May 2006), is Google Earth
4 beta, also released simultaneously on Windows XP and Mac OS X.
</p><p>
Unlike Picasa's Linux implementation, which was built with Wine, Google
Earth for Linux is a native application, built with the Qt development
kit. It requires 2.4 or later kernel versions, and it has been tested on
modern versions of Ubuntu, SUSE, Fedora Core, Linspire, Gentoo, Debian
and Red Hat. Download the free application at <a href="http://earth.google.com" target="_self">earth.google.com</a>.

When GoDaddy.com moved 4.5 million domain names from Apache to
Microsoft's IIS on Windows 2003 (and paid to by Microsoft, reports
said), it caused a 5% sever share drop for Apache on the next month's
Netcraft report. In response, Bruce Perens created
OpenSourceParking.com, a no-cost parking lot for undeveloped domain
names. In addition to helping restore Apache's pre-eminent position
(which has been between 65% and 70% for a while now), it helps Linux as
well by telling Netcraft that all the parked sites are running Apache
on Linux. Also, revenue from advertising on the parked domains will fund
efforts on behalf of open-source and free software.
</p><p>
To park your undeveloped domain there, set your domain servers to
ns1.opensourceparking.com and ns2.opensourceparking.com. DNS operators
can set their undeveloped domain names to be a CNAME of
opensourceparking.com. Domain resellers not tempted by Microsoft candy
can set parking site names to opensourceparking.com.

networks will blanket this world, just as cell networks now blanket
Kenya and other parts of Africa. (Almost everyone I run across in Kenya
has a cell phone&mdash;including people who live in Kibera, the largest slum

unimaginable two years ago. Millions of new voices will join the
