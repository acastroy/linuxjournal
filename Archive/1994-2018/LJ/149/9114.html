High-performance systems and high-performance software are often easier
to come by than high-performance users.  Perhaps it's because we all work
too hard.  It's time to take a break, because peak performance, strangely
enough, requires a little rest and relaxation.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xac5580.0xbbd3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, you look dreadful.  How long have you been sitting
in front of that computer? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You were in the restaurant
six hours before it opened! Whatever for? You were trying to come up
with something for today's High-Performance menu, and you became
distracted.  By what? Ah, I see, still trying to become the world
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PlanetPenguin Racer</em></span> champion, are you? Fran&ccedil;ois, by now, even Tux needs
a break, and he's just a character on a video game.  Besides, how can you
expect to perform at peak performance if you don't take a break? Plus,
our guests will be here any moment, and you have a lot of work to do
before they arrive.
</p><p>
Too late&mdash;our guests are here.  Time to fetch the wine,
Fran&ccedil;ois.  Something Chilean for tonight, I think.  Bring back the 2001
Casa Lapostolle Clos Apalta, and hurry.  Or at least, as quickly as you
can hurry, hunched over like that.  And, do a few stretches before you
come back.  You must look your best for our guests.
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone! It is my exquisite pleasure to see you all here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of superb Linux software and spectacular wines.  Please
sit and make yourselves comfortable.  I've sent Fran&ccedil;ois to fetch the
wine, but I ask for your patience as he is moving a little slowly right
now.  Fran&ccedil;ois is a victim of sitting too long in front of his computer
without taking a break.  I wish I could say he was working, but he was
playing video games.
</p><p>
My faithful waiter isn't the only one who suffers from this.  All of us
here spend far too long with our eyes fixed on the screen before us,
occasionally moving the mouse, typing endlessly, clicking here and
there.  It sounds like we should all be accomplishing great things,
but mostly we achieve tired eyes, sore muscles, carpal tunnel syndrome
and worse. Luckily, we can use the same computer that puts us in this
predicament to provide a solution, by using some great open-source
software to force us to take a break.  These handy little
programs sit quietly in the background as you work.  Then, at some
regularly programmed intervals, they pop up a gentle reminder to take
a break.
</p><p>
One such program has been around for quite some time.  It's
Eddie Kohler's Xwrits.  You can pick up Xwrits from
from its Web site (see the on-line Resources).  Optionally, check the contrib sites
for your distribution of choice.  When Xwrits runs, it monitors your keyboard
activity and runs a timer in the background.  When you have reached the
maximum typing time, it pops up a warning window with brightly colored
cartoon-like images of (presumably) Eddie's wrist flexing as though it
needs a break.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9114f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.  Xwrits displays a
hand opening and closing &ldquo;in pain&rdquo; to alert you that it's time to take
a break.
</p></div></div><p>
To activate the countdown timer for your break, either stop what you are
doing or click on the Xwrits window.  The cartoon hand exclaims
&ldquo;Whew&rdquo;,
and your break timer starts.  When your break is done, another image
appears giving you the thumbs up to continue.  Simply click the window
again and it vanishes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9114f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.  Click on the
image to start your break.  There, don't you feel better?
</p></div></div><p>
The amount of time you can type before being forced to take a break is
configurable.  For instance, if you want to specify a time frame of
15 minutes before a break is forced, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xwrits finger top typetime=15 break=2
</pre>
</p><p>
Let me explain those options.  The <tt  >finger</tt> option specifies that
I will get a rude warning (the finger) telling me to take a break.  When
you add <tt  >top</tt> to the options, the program tries to keep the
Xwrits window on top of other windows you may have open (very useful).  The
<tt  >break=</tt> option defines how long I must break before control is
returned to the screen.  Many other options exist that you should
look at, including lock, which locks the keyboard, forcing the
issue of whether you should take a break.  Use the breakclock option to
display a timer showing the amount of time left on your break.  Xwrits
even can monitor other workstations or sessions by using the display
option.  Make sure you check the included manual page or read it on
the Xwrits Web site.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you finally have returned.  Nice to have you back,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>.  Please, pour for our guests.
</p><p>
Xwrits is a nice, light application, but those looking for a little more
flavor may want to take a look at Tom Albers and Bram Schoenmakers'
RSIBreak, available from its Web site (see Resources).  RSIBreak
is designed for KDE and integrates very nicely into the desktop.  It is
highly configurable, provides statistics on your compliance and can
display a slideshow of pictures on your desktop.  Choose wisely, and these
pictures can be part of the relaxing experience that RSIBreak provides.
</p><p>
The program starts with a message directing you to the little clock icon
on your system tray.  This message pops up every time you start RSIBreak,
but you can turn it off by checking the Do not show this message again
box.  A number of defaults already have been set for you, but
most of them can be changed.  Possibly the most important change will
be the length and frequency of breaks that RSIBreak encourages.  Tiny
breaks are encouraged every ten minutes with a 20-second
duration&mdash;basically just long enough to take your fingers away from
the keyboard and
rotate or massage your wrists before getting back into it.  The big breaks
occur every 60 minutes and last one minute.  This is the change I tend
to make.  To make these changes, right-click on the RSIBreak system tray
icon and select Configure RSIBreak (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9114f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.  RSIBreak
hides neatly out of the way in the KDE system tray.  A right-click provides
access to its functions.
</p></div></div><p>
The RSIBreak configuration window appears with a left-hand sidebar
categorizing changes under General, Timings, Popup and Maximized.  The
General category is auto-selected, and there is one change you might
want to make right here.  Click the check box to have RSIBreak start every
time you log in to your KDE desktop.  Now, click Timings, and let us have
a look at those default break times (Figure 4).  The tiny break is fine
for me, and a big break every hour seems like a good idea as well, but one
minute just doesn't seem like enough.  Let's change this to five minutes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9114f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4.  Short and long
breaks in RSIBreak can be configured along with many other options.
</p></div></div><p>
The final setting on this window defines how long slideshow images are
displayed before moving on to the next image.  To finish the slideshow
setup, make sure you click on the Maximized icon.  By default, your home
folder is used to display images, but you can set an alternate location
here.  There's also a check box to allow the program to search the selected
image folder recursively.  At any given time, you can pause your mouse
cursor over the system tray icon to get a report on the amount of time
left before you are encouraged to take another break (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9114f5.large.jpg"><img src="9114f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5.  Pause
your mouse cursor over RSIBreak's system tray icon to see how far away
your next break is.
</p></div></div><p>
When you are satisfied with your settings, click OK to close the
configuration dialog.  Now, right-click on the system tray icon one more
time, and you'll see an option labeled Usage Statistics.  Click here for
a report of your compliance with the suggested breaks.  The report lists
percentage of activity, number of breaks, time spent, breaks skipped
and more.
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois, refills your glasses, let me
direct your attention to the final item on tonight's menu, Rob Caelers'
Workrave.  This is another great helper for taking breaks, and you
can get your copy at its Web site (see Resources).  Like the other programs
we've looked at, Workrave sits in the background, waiting to remind
you that it's time to break.  The length of break varies from micro
breaks that last a few seconds to rest breaks lasting a few minutes,
and finally to a message that it's time to log out and go home for
the day.  As you might expect, these breaks are configurable, and yes,
it is possible to skip or postpone a break if you really, really, have
to keep working.  What sets Workrave apart from the others is that
the program also suggests exercises you can do at your desk during
the longer rest breaks (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9114f6.large.jpg"><img src="9114f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6.  Workrave
suggests a number of exercises you may want to do during breaks.
</p></div></div><p>
To start using Workrave, run the program either from the command line
(command name: <tt  >workrave</tt>) or by pressing Alt-F2 and entering the program
name in the run box.  The first thing you will see is a small window
with three icons on the left and bars on the right (Figure 7).  The icons
represent a micro break (the hand), a rest break (the coffee cup) and your
time to leave (an open door).  The bars are both graphical and numeric
countdown timers for the various breaks.  A panel applet provides a quick
graphical display of the time left until your next break.  Should you wish to
bring back the small timer window, right-click on the applet, and select
Open from the pop-up (or pop-down) menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9114f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7.  The Default
Workrave Status Window
</p></div></div><p>
Workrave works equally well regardless of whether you use KDE or GNOME for
your desktop environment.  KDE users will see a small sheep icon in their
system tray.  Pause your mouse cursor over the icon, and the countdown
timers appear in a tooltip box.  GNOME users will see one of the
three bars from the timer window, cycling slowly through the various
break types.  When the time comes for a micro-break, a small pop-up window
appears letting you know that a break is imminent.  Just for fun,
try clicking on the pop-up at this point, and you'll notice that it runs
away from your mouse cursor.  The idea is for you to take a break, and
Workrave tries to make this as clear as possible.  As with RSIBreak,
the length of breaks is totally configurable.  I don't think of myself
as a workaholic, but I do think that three minutes between micro-breaks
is a tad low, and I immediately changed this one to ten minutes.  To make
those changes, right-click on the panel icon (or the Workrave window),
and select Preferences.  A three-tabbed window appears with three
icons in the left-hand sidebar (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9114f8.large.jpg"><img src="9114f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8.  Workrave is
extremely flexible.  Make sure you take note of all the options.
</p></div></div><p>
The first icon controls the timers for your micro-break and rest breaks
as well as the daily limit.  Aside from the time between breaks, you
also can change the break duration and the postpone time.  For the person who
just can't take a break, there's even an option to turn off the Skip
and Postpone buttons.  Under the rest break tab, you also can decide
how many exercises you will be shown.
</p><p>
Before I wrap up here, look back to the left-hand sidebar icons, and click
on the User interface icon.  Once again, this is a three-tabbed view with
a number of options.  I'm going to let you explore most of these, but I
do want to point out one item under the General tab.  There's a drop-down
list labeled Block mode.  The default is to Block input.  Change this
option to Block input and screen, and not only is your keyboard locked,
but the whole screen blanks out as well.  That means no sneaky reading
of e-mail or Web news while you are supposed to be taking a break.
</p><p>
If you are wondering how well you are doing with your new regimen of
regular breaks, right-click on the Workrave applet (or status window) and
select Statistics.  Workrave keeps extensive statistics on your activity,
the number of breaks you have taken and even keeps a day-to-day history.
</p><p>
None of the programs I've shown you here will do anything to hasten the
arrival of the oft-predicted four-day work week, nor will any of them lead you to
a life of leisure, but they might just be the solution for your neck pain,
aching back and sore wrists.  On that note, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it is time
to take a much longer break.  Closing time, it appears, is almost upon
us.  We don't want anyone leaving tense or tired, so take your fingers off
those keyboards and relax.  The best thing for your hands to be doing
at this point is lifting a wineglass to your lips.  On that note, I'm
sure Fran&ccedil;ois is sufficiently well rested and will be more than happy
to refill your glasses.
</p><p>
Please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
