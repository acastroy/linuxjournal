    The Motif toolkit has come to Linux. Dale reviews Sequioa
    International's Motif Toolkit for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It is worth pointing out up front that
for the most part, Motif is Motif regardless of who you buy it
from. A vendor licenses the Motif source code from the Open
Software Foundation (OSF), and then ports it to whatever platform
they want so they can sell the resulting libraries and executables.
Therefore, the main part of the product will not vary much from
vendor to vendor, or platform to platform. However, where a vendor
gets a chance to differentiate themselves is with the user's
manuals and the installation procedure they provide. In my view,
Sequoia has done an excellent job in bringing Motif to the Linux
platform. Any of the complaints I raise in this article are really
complaints about Motif and not about the job Sequoia has done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a500"></a>What is Motif?</h2></div></div><p>Motif is really three things. First, it is a set of
guidelines which define the way an X-Window user interface should
look and feel. To the untrained eye, Motif looks an awful lot like
Microsoft Windows or OS/2's Presentation Manager. This should come
as no surprise, when the history of Motif is considered. The Motif
&ldquo;shell&rdquo; program provided with the libraries gives this history of
Motif:</p><p>On December 30, 1988, OSF announced that the user environment
component offering will be based on several leading technologies:
Digital Equipment Corporation's toolkit technology (widgets) and
the joint Hewlett-Packard/Microsoft submission of H-P's 3-D
appearance and Microsoft's Presentation Manager-compatible behavior
(window manager). The hybrid offering, OSF/Motif environment will
provide users with a familiar way to access computer resources
across a broad variety of computing hardware platforms, from
personal computers to mainframes.</p><p>The driving force behind Motif was to unify the graphical
user interface look and feel of Unix-based software so that it
could compete for the desktop against other standards like the
Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. By having a standard look and feel
which was common across many hardware platforms, users would
benefit by not having to relearn how to interact with software as
they moved around and developers would benefit by having a standard
to program against.</p><p>This brings us to the second part of what Motif is. Motif is
a standard set of widgets with a documented interface which may be
ported from platform to platform. It is safe to say that if a
platform supports X-Window development, then it will not take much
effort to make it support Motif. All that's needed are the Motif
libraries, or failing that, a source code license from OSF for
Motif and a minor bit of effort to port them.</p><p>To many people, Motif is just a window manager for X-Windows.
This third aspect of Motif is what determines the way window
borders are drawn, how windows are resized, iconified, and moved.
Generally speaking, it defines how users and applications will
interact with their windowing system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a768"></a>Why Motif?</h2></div></div><p>Why would you want to run Motif on your Linux system? There
are three reasons, which parallel the three aspects of Motif
discussed above. First, you may want the applications you build to
follow the standards for GUI look-and-feel so that your users will
feel comfortable sooner and will benefit from consistency across
applications. Second, you may want to develop software on your
Linux box that you would like to port to other X-Windows platforms.
If you use the Motif toolkit to build your code, you will be able
to quickly port the user interface to any other platform that has
the Motif libraries available.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that the TK toolkit which comes with
many distributions can be used to create Motif-compliant
applications, though programming with it is radically different
than programming with the Motif widgets. I will not betray my own
bias on this issue; instead I defer you to the endless discussions
on this topic which are found in the Usenet comp.lang.tcl and
comp.windows.x newsgroups.</p><p>The last reason you may want to buy Motif for your Linux box
is to run the Motif Window Manager (mwm). You or your clients may
wish to have exactly the same look and feel on your Linux box as
you enjoy on other machines. While fvwm can closely emulate a Motif
look, it is not the same. The mwm window manager seems rock solid
and gives your Linux box an exact Motif look. Note that I am not
trying to knock fvwm; in fact, I prefer it to mwm because I like
its virtual desktop and its low memory use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a920"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>What kind of system resources does the Sequoia Motif consume?
The manual indicated that 12MB of free disk space were needed under
/usr, and 3MB were needed in /tmp. It turned out that 3.6MB of
space was needed in the /tmp directory, and only 9.9MB of space
were used in the /usr directory.</p><p>A Linux kernel newer than 0.99pl13 is required, and XFree86
2.0 must be installed in the standard way (under /usr/X386). The
documentation describes how to check this (and in fact the
installation script checks it as well). My Slackware 1.1.1 had it
in the right spot.</p><p>Sequoia also recommends 12MB of RAM to do development (i.e.,
compiling and linking Motif programs). I have only 8MB and I was
able to do it with no more swapping than I normally get when I do
compiling. It is usable with 8MB, but certainly it's better with
12MB.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4aad8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Sequoia has done a great job with their installation
instructions. They make it very clear what to do. Motif comes on
three 3.5" diskettes. You first install copy these into /tmp using
cpio and then you run an installation script. One small complaint I
have is that cpio tells you to load a &rdquo;tape&ldquo;, which could confuse
some people, but that is cpio's problem and certainly not Sequoia's
or Motif's. The installation script verifies that you have X386
installed and won't continue without it. This is nice.</p><p>I was done installing in about 10 minutes. The script made
all the necessary links and put all the executables and libraries
into the right spots. I literally had nothing more to set up or do
to run or develop motif programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4ac38"></a>Firing up MWM</h2></div></div><p>I had a &rdquo;start MWM&ldquo; option on my &ldquo;fvwm&rdquo; root menu, so I tried
it. Bingo; just like that I was running mwm! To make mwm my default
window manager I just had to edit my .xinitrc and replace the last
fvwm in the last line with mwm.</p><p>The documentation did not describe this, though anyone who is
advanced enough to want to use Motif would likely be able to figure
it out. This is a minor instance where the product could be
improved.</p><p>The main area that more instructions are needed is in the
customization of the window manager. I had a whale of a time
configuring mwm. I thought that all I'd need to do is copy the
sample mwmrc file they provide into ~/.mwmrc, make a few changes
and I'd be off. Well, an hour later I finally figured it out (after
signing onto a friend's machine to check out his .mwmrc).</p><p>It turns out that for your own window manager menus to be
activated, you must have a set of &ldquo;Button Bindings&rdquo; named
&ldquo;DefaultButtonBindings&rdquo; to tie the buttons to the menus. Now the
example mwmrc file does not have a set button bindings named
&ldquo;DefaultButtonBindings&rdquo; anywhere. Instead, it has
&ldquo;MyExplicitButtonBindings&rdquo;. So no matter what I did I wasn't
picking up my own menu buttons. Finally I read through the manual
enough to finally understand, changed the &ldquo;ExplicitButtonBindings&rdquo;
to &ldquo;DefaultButtonBindings&rdquo; and I was in business. This is not a
fault of the Linux product, but more generally with the Motif
documentation. Most often, users just copy an .mwmrc from someone
else they know. However, for Linux people who are often working in
isolated environments, it might be a nice touch to supply a more
ready-to-go sample .mwmrc or better documentation on setting one
up.</p><p>The other common thing you may want to change is the keyboard
focus policy. This determines how you choose the window into which
you will type. I prefer &ldquo;focus follows mouse&rdquo;, which means that all
I need to do is put the pointer into a window and I can start
typing. The default Motif behaviour is to have &ldquo;click to focus&rdquo;
where a window keeps focus until you click in another window. You
can also set whether or not you want the window with focus to be
raised automatically to the top of the stack. The two X resources
you alter in your .Xdefaults file are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Mwm*keyboardFocusPolicy: pointer
Mwm*focusAutoRaise: false
</pre><p>This is the type of behaviour I prefer, which is the focus
follows the mouse and it does not automatically raise the window
with focus. If you prefer the Microsoft windows behaviour, choose
the opposite settings (&ldquo;explicit&rdquo; for keyboardFocusPolicy and
&ldquo;true&rdquo; for focusAutoRaise) in your .Xdefaults file, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xrdb &lt; .Xdefaults
</pre><p>to update the settings, and finally restart mwm to apply the
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4b000"></a>What is Included?</h2></div></div><p>The Sequoia Motif comes with UIL (the user interface language
of Motif), static and shared Motif libraries, the full set of
on-line Motif manual pages, a number of demo programs with source
code, and the OSF/Motif user's guide.</p><p>If you want to distribute Motif programs, you need to link
statically by changing the definitions of the Motif libraries in a
makefile to include the static (.a) libraries. You are not allowed
to distribute the shared Motif libraries. This makes executables a
lot bigger; for a program I wrote, the executable was 130KB when
the shared libraries were used and 1.2MB when linked statically. If
you are going to be running a lot of Motif programs, it is better
to have the shared libraries around and have executables not linked
statically. It is possible to distribute executables linked with
the shared Motif libraries, but then only people with copies of the
shared Motif libraries will be able to run your binary.</p><p>The demo programs all make without a hitch on my 8MB system.
I believe that development can be done with 8MB, but of course if
you have more memory, things will work much faster, since there
will be much less swapping.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4b1b8"></a>Performance of mwm</h2></div></div><p>I found mwm to perform very well on my system.</p><p>I did check its memory usage, and found that it used 1460KB
of memory (according to TOP), while fvwm used only 296KB. Clearly,
if you are trying to conserve memory, fvwm is the better way to go.
As mentioned earlier, there is no virtual mwm, so if you like
having a larger than screen desktop, you'll want to stick with
fvwm. However, in terms of a solid consistent sharp look-and-feel,
mwm has a slight edge.</p><p>fvwm in top:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

platform. They have done a fine job bringing the industry standard
to Linux. If portability is a concern for you or you want to use
the same tools as the rest of the industry, then I recommend this
product.</p><p>[Ed: Since this review was written, GUI, Inc. has taken over
