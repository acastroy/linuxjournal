    This article serves as a buyers' guide for people about to
    purchase a Linux-capable laptop and points out existing
    software support for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f8450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The perfect laptop is energy-efficient,
lightweight, fast and upgradeable. These features are addressed in
product reviews which abound in popular PC magazines. The product
reviews are geared towards DOS/Windows users, and they tend to
ignore hardware support issues which would arise in other
environments. A valuable source of information for users about to
purchase a Linux-capable laptop is the Linux Laptop Survey, which
can be found in <b  >tsx-11:/pub/linux/
packages/laptops/laptop-survey</b>. You will find over fifty
entries describing make and model, disk size, processor, battery,
screen types and general comments that come in handy. One highly
overlooked issue addressed by the survey is that some laptops
employ proprietary components, such as RAM modules which can only
be upgraded by the original manufacturer. Other proprietary
components to look out for are PCMCIA adaptor chips, sound support,
and special displays.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f85b0"></a>Getting more power</h2></div></div><p>There are many factors that determine how long your laptop
will run tetherless, but probably the most important is the type of
battery your laptop uses. A few years back NiCd (Nickel-Cadmium)
batteries were the battery of choice for laptops. However, NiCd
batteries do not recharge properly unless they are completely
discharged, a behavior known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>memory
problem</em></span>.</p><p>Current generation laptops use batteries composed of NiMH
(Nickel Metal Hydride) which do not have the NiCd memory problem
and provide more energy. The next-generation battery beyond NiMH
uses lithium-ion as its power source which provides even more
energy.</p><p>Most modern laptops have a hot battery swapping feature,
which allows you to replace a drained battery with a charged one
while you are working without having to shutdown your system or
lose data. If your laptop supports battery swapping, then it has a
small internal battery that provides enough power to refresh the
DRAM.</p><p>Some laptops can even replace their floppy drive with an
additional battery, allowing you to operate your laptop for
extended tetherless periods. Others allow you to add extra battery
packs on the back, which have the added benefit of stabilizing your
system when you try to hold it on your lap.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f8818"></a>Virtuous misers</h2></div></div><p>Advanced power management (APM) is a specification from
Microsoft that allows the system software and the system BIOS to
cooperate in reducing overall power consumption. Laptops that
conform to the APM specification (i.e., their BIOS has APM) may use
software support to increase battery life by reducing the power
consumption of the system without degrading performance.</p><p>There are a myriad of x86 processors made by different
vendors for laptops, marked with the SL acronym. These processors
implement a set of system management mode (SMM) features to assist
in power management, but Linux does not yet take advantage of them.
Are these features worth their price, or are they simply a
marketing ploy by the processor manufacturer? One argument in their
favor is that the SL processors use 3.3-volt circuitry, which
consumes less than half the power of traditional 5-volt systems.
However, newer DX models (e.g., DX-4) also use 3.3-volt logic, so
the value of a SL processor is questionable.</p><p>Hard disk storage capacity ranges between 80 and 340MB. Most
modern laptops use second generation IDE drives which support
various power management features such as spinning down and turning
off unused components. By default, many laptops will automatically
spin down the disk after some idle period when running off of the
battery.</p><p><a href="2818s1.html" target="_self">Desktop vs. Laptop</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f8a80"></a>Money!</h2></div></div><p>Flat panel displays drive the overall price of the laptop.
There are different types of flat panel displays: active-matrix
color, dual-scan passive-matrix color, and passive-matrix
monochrome. Active matrix has the best color display, with
immediate refreshes that yield a crisp picture. The down side of
active matrix displays is that they are expensive, require more
battery power, and add to the overall weight and size of the
system. Also, unlike monochrome displays, active matrix displays
are barely viewable in direct sunlight. The opposite extreme is
passive matrix monochrome, with its low cost and low power
requirements. However, it doesn't refresh the screen as nicely, is
harder to read at an angle, and leaves streaks of former images
(known as &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo;). If cost is a limiting factor, but color is
required for your application, then dual-scan passive-matrix is a
reasonable alternative.</p><p>There are a few potential problems with laptop displays. Some
laptops may use new display chip sets that XFree86 does not fully
support, resulting in very low resolution and/or unacceptably low
speeds. Also, even more so than on desktop systems, the X-Windows
setup of Xconfig has to be done with extreme care to avoid possible
damage to LCD pixels. Pointing devices such as an external mouse,
trackball, or EZ-point (IBM mini-joystick in the middle of the
keyboard) are generally supported by Linux, since they usually
emulate one of the popular mouse types. At the moment there is no
support for pen input used on machines like the Compaq
Concerto.</p><p>Personal Computer Memory Card International Association
(PCMCIA) is a standards body for an IC card standard. The PCMCIA
standard is becoming the form factor of choice in laptops and the
PCMCIA devices released include modems, ethernet adaptors, radio
LAN adaptors, radio alphanumeric pagers, hard drives, SCSI
adaptors, multimedia, serial, parallel, GPS, and various types of
memory cards.</p><p>Most modern laptops have PCMCIA support and use a PCMCIA
adaptor chip provided by one of several vendors. The most commonly
found adaptor chips are the Intel 82365 and Databook TCIC/2. There
are others from Cirrus, Motorola, HP, IBM, Databook, Toshiba, etc.
Think of the PCMCIA adaptor chip as a built-in adapter for the
PCMCIA bus, just as there are various SCSI adapters. Unfortunately,
each chip requires a special driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f8c90"></a>Linux Support for Laptop Features</h2></div></div><p>Power management is not really supported under Linux. Based
on the Linux Laptop Survey results, a laptop running Linux will
typically last for two hours on batteries. Although an APM support
package does exist, it only provides the initial hooks into the APM
BIOS for power management. At this point the APM support just
recognizes when the system returns from sleep mode and updates the
internal clock, which is important to keep the system sane. APM
applications that display the current battery level and execute the
&ldquo;shutdown&rdquo; command when the battery runs low are also available.
This software may be retrieved from <b  >tsx-11:/pub/linux/
packages/laptops/apm</b>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the SL processor series has SMM
features to power manage the processor. However, a portable power
management solution that doesn't require SMM support is to halt the
processor in the scheduler's idle loop. The x86 asm(hlt)
instruction suspends the processor until there is an interrupt from
the system (e.g. a key stroke). Linux versions above v1.1.10
implement this simple and effective solution, which does not
degrade performance at all. It has the added benefit (even to
non-laptop users) of increasing the expected life of your
CPU.</p><p>PCMCIA provides plug-and-play capabilities to the laptop.
Currently support exists for the Intel 82365 adaptor chip, PCMCIA
modems (Megahertz, IBM, Intel, AT&amp;T, and others), and ethernet
cards (D-Link 650, Linksys, IBM credit card, and 3COM 3c589). The
PCMCIA support in Linux is still in its alpha stages and is
available from
<b  >tsx-11:/pub/linux/packages/laptops/pcmcia</b>.
PCMCIA support that meets the PCMCIA Unix specification is in the
works and you may expect it to be part of the standard Linux
distribution by the end of the year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1600580.0x16f8ef8"></a>Future Topics</h2></div></div><p>A future article will discuss operating system implications
