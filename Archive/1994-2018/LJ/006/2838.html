    This month, Cooking with Linux looks at a problem faced by
    most would-be Linux users&mdash;choosing the right distribution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1991580.0x1a89348"></a></h2></div></div><p>It's the time of month again when I
manage to dig myself out of the piles of source code listings,
overdue bills, and technical manuals that invade my desk, just long
enough to take a deep breath and make a wry comment on the status
of the computing community. Please excuse any spelling errors; my
eyes are still adjusting to the light.
</p><p>By now, you've (hopefully) gone over this Buyer's Guide issue
with a toothpick and magnifying glass, noting every minute detail,
pitting distribution against distribution, vendor against vendor,
in a fierce battle of marketing wit and technical expertise.
Unless, of course, you flipped immediately to this column,
realizing; along with so many other readers; that this is the only
part of <i  >Linux Journal</i> that condenses any genuinely useful
information.</p><p>At any rate, after digesting the product reviews and coverage
of major Linux distributions and software, you've more than likely
reached the stark conclusion that you're no better off than before
you picked up the magazine. There are just <span   class="emphasis"><em>too
many</em></span> distributors out there, and too many software
distributions to choose from. How on earth can anyone decide
amongst them all?</p><p>You may be tempted to employ the infamous Monte Carlo method.
Blindfold yourself. Open the magazine to a random page. Put your
finger down. Remove blindfold. Pick up the phone and order whatever
your finger happens to be pointing at. (&ldquo;Hello? Yes, I'd like to
order... uh... <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ian Murdock</em></span> please. What? He's
not for sale?&rdquo;)</p><p>Certainly you can see the futility of this approach. A better
method is the one that I suggest to true die-hard Unix hackers who
have, oh, a few months to kill. That is to forego this distribution
nonsense and to put together your own system from the kernel up.
Can't be done, you say? Impossible? Not so. The only requirements
are: One (1) personal computer. One (1) small Linux system on a
floppy; for example, the Slackware boot/root disk combination. And,
one (1) Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds. If
you happen to have all of the above ingredients, you should have no
problem at all.</p><p>Needless to say, things were easier back in the Good Old
Days, when the only &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; was a pair of floppy images made
available by H.J. Lu. Back then, users had no choice but to build a
system from scratch. Those rugged survivalists that made it through
the ordeals of Linux prehistory are now known as &ldquo;old hats&rdquo;. Some
of them live in caves. (Some of the caves have Ethernet drops,
which is certainly convenient.) Others have moved onto bigger and
brighter things, such as writing editorials for a certain
Linux-related magazine. Still others are nowhere to be
found.</p><p>All right, all right, but what about the rest of us; those
who don't have the hard-headedness required to install Linux the
old-fashioned way? After all, this magazine is literally teeming
with Linux distributors, right? Can't the choice of a Linux vendor
or distribution be boiled down to a simple, straightforward,
no-frills answer? Why the runaround? Why don't I get to the
point?</p><p>I seem to have forgotten the point.</p><p>But I do remember this: Selecting a Linux distribution is not
unlike buying a new car. You are faced with many questions: Do you
want a sporty and fun convertible (Slackware), or a family-sized
minivan (Yggdrasil)? Or are you comfortable enough with your Unix
hacking repertoire to test-drive an experimental new design
(Debian)? Do you want to go for a newer, and perhaps more expensive
model, with all of the options (anti-lock brakes, air conditioning,
and the Linux Documentation Project manuals), or are you content
with a rugged, do-it-yourself version (such as the InfoMagic CD-ROM
set)?</p><p>The list is endless. The best advice that I can give is to
talk with other Linux users, who have survived the adventure of
selecting and installing a particular distribution, and hear about
their experiences. Given the fact that Linux is free, you can
always borrow or copy the software from a friend. Using the UMSDOS
filesystem, you can even install Linux in a directory of an MS-DOS
partition, saving yourself from the time-consuming and destructive
repartitioning process; which usually requires you to backup the
entire system.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for? Pick a distribution and give it
a spin. Kick the tires. Find a country road and floor it. Crash it
a few times, if you can. If it works, and if it feels like the
system for you, take the plunge and buy the darn thing.</p><p>Fuzzy dice and vanity plates sold separately.</p></div></div>
