computer to a network? Perhaps you have two computers that you want
to run Mosaic, ftp, or X11 between? Do you want to let your friends
experience the full power of your magnificent new Linux box? SLIP
is one way you can do all these things.</p><p>by Warren Baird</p><p>SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) is a protocol that
allows you to make a TCP/IP connection over a serial line. TCP/IP
stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, and is
the protocol used on the Internet and on most local ethernets. Many
common Unix programs (like X11, Mosaic, gopher, IRC, talk, telnet
and ftp) use TCP/IP to communicate. If you want to use programs
like this to talk to the rest of the world over the Internet, or if
you want to connect two (or more) local machines, SLIP is a good
option.</p><p>There are actually two variants of SLIP: normal SLIP, and
CSLIP (which stands for Compressed SLIP). CSLIP compresses various
TCP/IP headers to give a higher throughput on a serial line. (Note:
CSLIP doesn't compress the data that is being transmitted, just the
headers added by TCP/IP.) Unfortunately not all systems support it.
Even with CSLIP, the throughput on a serial line is quite low
compared to ethernet and other Local Area Networks (LANs). It's
possible to run high bandwidth applications like Mosaic and xv over
a SLIP link, but the response times may be quite low.</p><p>One of the most common uses of SLIP is to connect to a
commercial Internet provider. There are many companies that provide
full access to the Internet by allowing you to make a SLIP
connection using a modem.</p><p>Another use of SLIP is to connect two or more machines using
a null-modem cable. Since SLIP is implemented for many different
platforms, you can connect your Linux box to many different types
of systems. For example, I have an Amiga 2000 connected to my 386
running Linux 1.0.8.</p><p>If you are really ambitious, you can even set up your Linux
box as a SLIP server. You could do this to give your friends access
to your machine, or as part of a BBS setup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214f580.0x2247870"></a>Configuring SLIP under Linux</h2></div></div><p>Configuring something like SLIP under Unix is always very
dependent on the flavor and version of Unix that you are running.
The details given here are for the Slackware 1.2.0 (Linux 1.0.8)
distribution. The exact details may vary somewhat with other
versions of Linux and other distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214f580.0x2247978"></a>What do all these files do?</h2></div></div><p>There is a whole host (no pun intended) of files that control
the behavior of a Unix system, and a number of them need to be
modified to set up SLIP.</p><p>Looking up host names: <b  >/etc/hosts</b>,
<b  >/etc/resolv.conf</b>, and
<b  >/etc/host.conf</b></p><p>The <b  >/etc/hosts</b> file maps hostnames (for
example acme.gadgets.com) to IP addresses (for example
129.50.49.234). If you are using SLIP to connect two local
machines, your /etc/hosts file only needs to contain the hostnames
and IP addresses of your two machines. If you are connected to a
larger network, but talk to only a few sites, you can put their
names and IP addresses in your /etc/hosts file.</p><p>If you are connecting to many hosts (or using a program like
Mosaic that connects to many hosts), you'll need to tell your
system who it should ask to find IP addresses for unknown
hostnames. There are systems called nameservers that will lookup an
IP address for a given hostname. The /etc/resolv.conf file tells
your system which nameserver(s) to use. It also tells your system
what your domain name is. The domain name is your full hostname
with the machine name removed&mdash;for example, if your hostname is
acme.gadgets.com, your domain name would be gadgets.com.</p><p>If your domain name is gadgets.com, and you have a nameserver
at the IP address 128.34.54.27, your
<b  >/etc/resolve.conf</b> file could read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
domain gadgets.com
nameserver 128.34.54.27
</pre><p>It's possible to list multiple nameservers in a
<b  >resolve.conf</b> file. The
<b  >/etc/host.conf</b> file tells the system what order
it should use to lookup hostnames. Normally this file
contains</p><pre     class="programlisting">
order hosts,bind
multi on
</pre><p>which tells the system to check the
<b  >/etc/hosts</b> file first, and then to try any
nameservers it knows about.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214f580.0x2248000"></a>What needs to be done at startup?</h2></div></div><p>The names of the Internet startup files vary even between
different Linux distributions. On most Linux systems the files used
are <b  >/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</b> and
<b  >/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</b>. Whichever startup file is
used, there are a number of daemons that must be running for any
TCP/IP program to work. The NET-2 HOWTO describes which daemons are
available, and what they do. Minimally, you need to have the inetd
daemon running. The inetd daemon coordinates the startup of many
other TCP/IP daemons.</p><p>Additionally, if you are setting up a permanent link to
another computer over a dedicated line, you may want to actually
initialize the SLIP link in the startup files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214f580.0x2248210"></a>How do I connect to another machine using
SLIP?</h2></div></div><p>There are two primary ways that you can connect to another
machine using SLIP. If it is a link over a leased line, or a
null-modem cable, you should use slattach. If you are connecting
over a modem (or allowing other computers to connect to yours over
a modem) you should use dip.</p><p>To configure a SLIP connection with slattach, you need to
execute the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/slattach -p prot -s baud dev &amp;
/sbin/ifconfig sl0 iplocal pointtopoint ipremote up
/sbin/route add default dev sl0 &amp;
</pre><p>where prot is the protocol to use (normally slip or cslip),
baud is the baud rate to connect at, dev is the device to use,
iplocal is your local IP address, and ipremote is the remote IP
address. For example, if your IP address is 129.45.43.76, and you
want to connect to a machine with IP address 129.50.49.234 using
slip at 19200 baud on /dev/ttyS1 (COM2), you would give the
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/slattach -p slip -s 19200 /dev/ttyS1 &amp;
/sbin/ifconfig sl0 129.45.43.76 pointtopoint\
   129.50.49.234 up
/sbin/route add default dev sl0 &amp;
</pre><p>These commands can either be added to a startup file, if you
always want the SLIP connection to be initialized, or you can
create a simple shell script to execute them for you. You'll have
to run this shell script as root for <b  >slattach</b> to
work. If, instead of a shell script, you create a C or
<b  >perl</b> program owned by <b  >root</b>,
you can make it setuid (always run as root) by typing
<b  >chmod u+s file</b> (where file is the name of the
program). Take note of the &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; following the /sbin/slattach
line. Older versions of the NET-2 HOWTO omitted the ampersand,
which caused Linux to lock up when booted if the commands were
added to the startup files.</p><p>The dip program is a little more complicated to use. To use
it to connect to another machine, you must create a script file
telling dip how to call the machine, log onto it, and start slip
(if slip isn't started automatically). The NET-2 HOWTO and the
dip(8) man page both give sample dip scripts (dip(8) means that the
man page for dip is in chapter 8 of the man pages, so you can read
the man pages with the command <b  >man 8 dip</b>). Dip
can also be used to allow other people to connect to your machine
using SLIP. To do this, you must create a special userid that has
dip as its shell. Instructions for doing this are in the
<b  >dip(8)</b> man page.</p><p>Troubleshooting: Some common problems and how to fix
them</p><p>Linux locking up at boot time</p><p>As I mentioned before, if you start slattach in your system
startup files, you must add an ampersand (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) after the
slattach line to run slattach in the background. Otherwise your
system will lock up when you reboot.</p><p>Packets disappear without a trace</p><p>There can be many causes of this. The first thing to check is
that your serial link is correct. If you are using a null-modem
cable, make sure that it's plugged in at each end. If you are
connecting over a modem, make sure that the modem is working
correctly. If you are using a null-modem cable, and you have easy
access to both ends of the link, try starting a terminal program on
one end, and see if anything shows up if you ping the machine
running the terminal program. If garbage appears in the terminal
program, then you know that your serial link is working.</p><p>There seems to be a problem with CSLIP in some versions of
Linux. If you are using CSLIP and packets seem to be disappearing,
try using SLIP instead.</p><p>Unknown host errors occur</p><p>The first thing to do is to try using an IP address instead
of a hostname. If you were trying to type ping acme when you got
the Unknown host error, find the IP address of the machine acme,
and ping it instead. For example, if acme has an IP address of
128.155.123.6, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ping 128.155.123.6
</pre><p>instead. If using the IP address works, you have a problem
with translating hostnames into IP addresses. Make sure your
/etc/hosts file has a correct entry for your hostname, or if you
are using a nameserver, make sure that your system isn't having
trouble contacting the nameserver. As a temporary fix, adding an
entry for the hostname into your /etc/hosts should solve the
problem.</p><p>If the IP address doesn't work either, you may need to use
the route command to tell your system how to find the remote
system. The NET-2 HOWTO and the route(8) man page show you how to
use the route command.</p><p>&ldquo;Network is Unreachable&rdquo; Errors</p><p>If you see messages like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
</pre><p>when you are trying to use ping, the most likely cause is
incorrect routing. Using the /sbin/route command by itself shows
you the current routing table. If the routing table is configured
correctly, you should see something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Destination  Gateway  Genmask  Flags  Metric  Ref  Use  Iface
127.0.0.0    *       255.0.0.0 U     0       0    0    lo
default      *       *        U     0       0    3    sl0
</pre><p>If the last line isn't present, and you are using slattach,
make sure that the /sbin/route line described above has been used.
If the last line is present, or if you are using dip, see the NET-2
HOWTO, and the dip(8) and route(8) man pages.</p><p>What alternatives are there to SLIP?</p><p>There are other programs that provide functionality similar
to SLIP. Here is a brief overview of some of the most
popular.</p><p>If you want to connect two local machines, the best way is to
use ethernet, which gives far higher throughput than a serial link.
Unfortunately, ethernet cards can be fairly expensive. If you can't
afford a pair of ethernet cards, or if you want to connect to
another machine using a modem, there are other options. SLIP isn't
the only protocol that provides TCP/IP (or TCP/IP-like)
connectivity over a serial line. PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is a
newer protocol that serves a purpose similar to SLIP. PPP was
designed specifically to be an Internet standard, and is documented
in a number of Internet RFCs (Requests for Comments). This design
process makes PPP more standardized than SLIP. Additionally, PPP
was designed to address known weaknesses of SLIP in areas of
security and robustness. Unfortunately, since PPP is a lot newer
and more difficult to implement than SLIP, it isn't available on as
many systems as SLIP is.</p><p>Another common program is term. Term does not provide a full
TCP/IP connection, but it does allow some similar functionality. It
will let you run multiple terminal sessions over a single serial
line (like SLIP does), but it won't let you run TCP/IP programs
(like ftp, Mosaic, or telnet) on your Linux box without recompiling
them to include term support. It will let you display remote X11
programs on your local machine, so you could, for instance, run
Mosaic remotely and display it on your Linux box. You can also use
term to connect ports on the local machine to ports on the remote
machine, which allows you to read news and mail on your Linux box.
The biggest advantage that term has over SLIP is that it can be set
up on both ends without requiring root privileges. Unlike SLIP, you
don't have to change any system configuration files to use
term.</p><p>PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is a SLIP-like
protocol that runs over a parallel line. PLIP is only intended to
connect two machines locally, but it gives higher transfer rates
than a comparable SLIP connection at the cost of using more CPU
time than SLIP. To use PLIP you need a special parallel cable, like
those used in a number of DOS PC-to-PC file transfer
packages.</p><p>If you only want to connect two local machines, you might
want to consider just running a terminal program over a serial
link. The configuration is certainly simpler than setting up SLIP
(you need to start a getty process on the appropriate serial port),
and if you run a program like screen (which allows multiple
sessions in a manner similar to virtual consoles), you might get
all the functionality that you need. Certain operations (like
transferring files) are more efficient when just using a terminal
program, since there isn't the overhead imposed by SLIP. The
disadvantage is that you can't run X11, or any other TCP/IP
programs through a terminal program.</p><p>Recommended reading</p><p>The Serial and NET-2 HOWTOs have a lot of useful information
about networking and serial links with Linux in general. The NET-2
HOWTO has an entire section devoted to SLIP. The HOWTO files can be
found in /usr/doc/faq/howto on most Linux systems, or on the ftp
site sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.</p><p>The Usenet newsgroups comp.os.linux.help and
comp.os.linux.admin both discuss SLIP quite regularly. Reading
these newsgroups will often answer simple questions about SLIP (and
many other things). It's a good idea to read the appropriate HOWTOs
and FAQs (Frequently Asked Question lists) before asking any
questions, since some people become quite irate when you ask
questions that are answered somewhere else.</p><p>There are a number of books that address administrating
TCP/IP connections. The best I have come across is TCP/IP Network
Administration, by Craig Hunt, published by O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, ISBN 0-937175-82-X.</p><p>SLIP isn't the newest TCP/IP protocol around, but it is
commonly available and is usually quite stable. It's a good choice
for many serial TCP/IP links.</p><p>Warren Baird runs Linux on a 386 DX-33, and has been hacking
