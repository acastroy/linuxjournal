    This month's column discusses the Texinfo document
    formatting language, which is used for all GNU
    documentation. Its main feature is that one source file can
    be used to prepare both printed text, and on-line,
    hypertext-style documentation.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x13293a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>We will just cover the high points of
Texinfo. There is a complete manual (around 200 pages) that
describes Texinfo in full detail. If you intend to actually write a
manual, or do major surgery on an existing one, then it will be
worth your while to read the Texinfo manual first. (Nicely printed
and bound versions of the Texinfo manual can be purchased from the
Free Software Foundation. Doing so not only saves wear and tear on
your laser printer and gives you a nicely bound book, it also
directly contributes to the production of more free
software.)</p><p>Texinfo comes in the <b  >texinfo-3.1.tar.gz</b>
software distribution from the Free Software Foundation
(<b  >ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu</b> is the site).
This contains all the software (except TeX) needed to use
Texinfo.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x13295b0"></a>Processing Texinfo Files</h2></div></div><p>Texinfo is designed to be processed by two (really three)
different sets of programs. The first is TeX, the text processing
system written by Donald Knuth. TeX is a freely available, fairly
large software suite. If you acquired a CD-ROM Linux distribution,
TeX was probably already set up for you. The file
<b  >texinfo.tex</b> is a series of TeX macros that tells
TeX how to format Texinfo files, and must be installed in the TeX
macros directory.</p><p>Texinfo allows you to produce output in several paper sizes:
6 by 9.25 inch (normal book), 8.5 by 11 inch (standard American
sheet of paper) or A4 (standard European paper).</p><p>The second program is called <b  >makeinfo</b>.
This program reads your Texinfo files and generates a formatted
Info file or files. These files can then be viewed with an Info
viewer. If you are a GNU Emacs user, then you have a third option,
<b  >texinfo-format-buffer</b> within Emacs. This will
also generate a formatted Info file. The
<b  >makeinfo</b> program is preferred; it is written in
C and is faster than <b  >texinfo-format-buffer</b>. It
is also somewhat smarter, and it does not require Emacs underneath
it.</p><p>To view an Info document, you need an Info viewer. There are
two choices, Info mode in GNU Emacs, or the stand-alone
<b  >info</b> viewer that comes with the Texinfo
distribution. We'll talk about viewing a little bit later.</p><p>An important point to remember when writing Texinfo documents
is that you are writing for two audiences; those using info and
those reading the printed book. This dual nature of the document
has a strong influence on the design of the Texinfo language; there
are a number of constructs that are used for one case and ignored
for the other. There are Info-to-HTML converters in use at a number
of WWW sites on the Internet, and <b  >makeinfo</b> is
being enhanced to generate HTML directly, although there is not yet
a release date for this version of makeinfo.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1329a80"></a>What is Texinfo?</h2></div></div><p>Texinfo documents are structured like conventional books,
with chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections. (Four
levels is as deep as you can go, but that is almost always more
than you need.) Each chapter, section and so on is referred to as a
&ldquo;node&rdquo;. In fact, this structure is actually what Computer
Scientists like to refer to as a tree. The &ldquo;root&rdquo; of the document
is a special node called the &ldquo;top&rdquo; node. Computer Scientists draw
their trees starting at the top and growing downwards.

document.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\input texinfo  @c -*-texinfo-*-
@c %**start of header (This is for running texinfo on a region.)
@setfilename Foogol.info
@settitle Foogol Language Programming
@c %**end of header (This is for running texinfo on a region.)
</pre><p>This is the front of the document. It reads in the Texinfo
macros, and sets the Info file name and the title to be used in
page headers. The @c starts a comment. Shown here are magic
comments that make GNU Emacs happy (the <b  >%**start of
header</b>, and so on). These comments are boilerplate; just
put them there and don't worry about what they mean (I don't; I'm
not an Emacs user).</p><pre     class="programlisting">

@ifinfo
@format
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
* Foogol: (foogol.info).   A Wonderful Programming Language.
END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
@end format
@end ifinfo
@end ignore
</pre><p>This is the entry for the <b  >dir</b> file in the
<b  >/usr/local/info</b> directory. This is how info
knows what Info files are available. Most of the text surrounding
the middle line is so that separate shell scripts can find and
extract this line and add it to the dir file. Unfortunately, the
FSF is not yet distributing these scripts. In short, this is more
boilerplate; the middle line is the important one. It describes
your document in one line. Right now, you have to manually update
the dir file when installing a new Info file in the
<b  >/usr/local/info</b> directory.</p><p>This shows a number of things about Texinfo. First, the @ is
the command character. All special constructs in Texinfo start with
@. (Use @@ to get a real &ldquo;@&rdquo;.) Second, many constructs come in
pairs, <b  >@foo ... @end foo</b>. Things between
<b  >@ignore</b> and <b  >@end</b> ignore are
skipped by all the Texinfo processors.</p><p>The <b  >@ifinfo ... @end ifinfo</b> lines bracket
text that is meant only for an Info file, and not for printed TeX
documentation. There is also a corresponding <b  >@iftex ...
@end iftex</b> construct for things that should only be in
the printed document, and not in the Info file.</p><p>The <b  >@format</b> and <b  >@end</b>
format bracket example text that is not indented. (In this case,
since it's being ignored, it has no effect.)</p><p>(The whole business with the dir line is a bit unusual. It is
a feature in transition, that will eventually become a mainstream
part of the Texinfo language. Right now, it's done as shown, with
everything ignored by the Texinfo processors. You don't have to do
this in your Texinfo documents, but it doesn't hurt,
either.)</p><p>Next comes information describing what is documented, the
edition of the document, and the version of the program being
documented. This is followed by the copyright information and
permission notices.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

@end ifinfo
</pre><p>This is the special &ldquo;top&rdquo; node. It should appear only in the
Info file, which is why it is bracketed in
<b  >@ifinfo</b> and <b  >@end ifinfo</b>. It
has a brief description of what the Info file documents.</p><p>Here, for the first time, we see an actual
<b  >@node</b> statement. The <b  >@node</b>
lists, in order, this node's name, it's successor, it's
predecessor, and the &ldquo;up&rdquo; node. The successor and predecessor are
usually nodes at the same level in the tree; the up node is the
parent. In the case of the top node, it's a little bit different.
The successor is the first child node (chapter) in the document,
and both the predecessor and up node are the special
(<b  >dir</b>) node that represents the dir file.</p><p>Following any node with children is a menu. The menu lists
all of the node's children (usually in order), with a brief
description of what each node describes.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>The menu for the top node is called the &ldquo;master menu&rdquo;. It has
entries for at least all the chapter level nodes in the file. More
commonly, it has entries for every node in the file, almost in
order. Usually, all the chapter level nodes are first, and then all
the &ldquo;interior&rdquo; nodes come after that, in the order they would be in
a book. After all the stuff at the front, you simply settle down
and write your document. Each node has a unique name. In
<b  >makeinfo</b>, case in node names is ignored, while
in TeX it is not, so for best results, keep the case in all
instances of a node name the same.</p><p>Each <b  >@node</b> statement is followed by a
sectioning command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@node Introduction, Syntax, Preface, Top
@chapter Introduction To Foogol
The @code{Foogol} language was invented in 1897. ...
</pre><p>There are corresponding <b  >@section</b>,
<b  >@subsection</b> and
<b  >@subsubsection</b> commands. There are also commands
for unnumbered chapters and sections,
<b  >@unnumbered</b>, <b  >@unnumberedsec</b>,
<b  >@unnumberedsubsec</b>,
<b  >@unnumberedsubsubsec</b>, and similarly for
appendices as well, <b  >@appendix</b>,
<b  >@appendixsec</b> and so on. There are even commands
for titles that won't appear in the table of contents:
<b  >@heading</b>, <b  >@subheading</b>, and so
on, although these still require separate node names and menu
entries.</p><p>As you might imagine, keeping the &ldquo;next&rdquo;, &ldquo;previous&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;up&rdquo; pointers in synch while writing a document is a bit painful.
Fortunately, as long as you have the correct sectioning commands
and each node with children has a correct menu, makeinfo will
figure out the pointers for you. In practice, this means that you
can leave them off. TeX does not care a whole lot about nodes,
although it does not ignore them entirely, as we shall see.</p><p>The Texinfo major mode in GNU Emacs will construct menus for
you, and also automatically update the &ldquo;next&rdquo;, &ldquo;previous&rdquo;, and &ldquo;up&rdquo;
pointers. If you don't use Emacs, you must do this manually, or
write a separate program to do it for you (which is what I did,
using gawk).</p><p>At the end of your document, you need to print the table of
contents. Texinfo provides both a &ldquo;summary&rdquo; contents page, and a
full table of contents page.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@summarycontents
@contents
@bye
</pre><p>The <b  >@bye</b> ends processing. You can put
notes to yourself in the file after the <b  >@bye</b>; I
use it in The GAWK Manual to keep my &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1321b20"></a>Indices</h2></div></div><p>Texinfo maintains six pre-defined indices; the concept,
variable, function, keystroke, program, and data type indices. To
add to the concept index, for instance:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@cindex History of @code{Foogol}
@cindex @code{Foogol}, History of
</pre><p>The variable index uses <b  >@vindex</b>, the
function index <b  >@findex</b>, and so on.</p><p>You can create your own indices, and it is also possible to
merge indices; for example to have variables, functions, and
concepts all in the same index. These are typically printed at the
end of a document, right before the table of contents, with the
<b  >@printindex</b> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1321e38"></a>In-Line Font Changes</h2></div></div><p>We have already seen <b  >@code</b>, that sets text
in a constant-width or Courier-like font. There are several other
commands that provide special output for different items.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@samp   - for in-line code fragments
@file   - for file names
@var    - things that can vary, parameters, values, and so on
@emph   - emphasizes something, using italics
@strong - makes a strong point, using bold
@r      - force roman (normal) text
@i      - force italic text
@b      - force bold text

commands suffice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1322048"></a>Tables And Lists</h2></div></div><p>Texinfo allows you to easily write lists and simple
tables.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@enumerate A @c A list "numbered" A, B, C ...
@item
First item here
@item
Second item here
....
@end enumerate
</pre><p>Leaving off the &ldquo;A&rdquo; would have generated a numbered list, and
using a small &ldquo;a&rdquo; would have used lower-case letters. A simple list
with a minus or bullet would be written:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@itemize @bullet
@item
First item here
@item
Second item here
....
@end itemize
</pre><p>This generates a list with bullets for each item. Using
<b  >@minus</b> would generate a minus sign. (Minus signs
and dashes are different characters when typesetting; minuses are
longer.)</p><p>There are several kind of tables. Each one takes a formatting
code that describes how to format the individual items. For
instance, a list of command line options would use @samp.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
The list of @code{foogol} command line arguments are:
@table @samp
@item -f @var{filename}
Use @var{filename} as the source file.
@item -o @var{prog}
Use @var{prog} as the executable program.
@item -d
Print the date, time of day, and current phase of the moon.
...
@end table
</pre><p>Two other similar commands are <b  >@vtable ... @end
vtable</b>, and <b  >@ftable ... @end ftable</b>.
These are just like <b  >@table</b>, but they
automatically make an entry for each item in the variable and
function indices, respectively, which can save you some
typing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1322518"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>There are several commands for formatting text that is marked
off in a special fashion, such as examples, quotations, and so on.
The primary one is <b  >@example ... @end</b> example
which is generally used for program or other computer input and
output. The text will be printed indented, in a Courier-like font,
and it will not be otherwise filled or adjusted.</p><p>The <b  >@format ... @end</b> format is like
<b  >@example</b>, but does not do the indenting. You can
quote extended pieces of text by enclosing the quote in
<b  >@quotation ... @end quotation</b>.</p><p>After an example, it is typical to continue a thought without
starting a new paragraph. To keep the continuation text from being
indented like a new paragraph, precede it with
<b  >@noindent</b>.</p><p>This example shows the results of running our program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@example
$ make_money
Congratulations! You are a rich   Memory fault - core dumped

As we can see, there is a small problem somewhere.

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1322938"></a>Cross-References</h2></div></div><p>A distinguishing feature of Texinfo documents is that they
are liberally filled with cross-references. There are several kinds
of cross-reference statements, all of which take at least a node
name as their argument.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@xref{Introduction}, for a description of the
history of @code{Foogol}.
</pre><p>There are longer forms that can take the full title of a node
(from the <b  >@chapter</b> command, for example). In
TeX, the cross-reference will generate a typical cross-reference,
including a page number.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
See [Introduction], page 12, for a description of the history of Foogol.
</pre><p>In an Info file, the cross-reference commands put
cross-references into the text. The cross reference would look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*Note Introduction, for a description of the
history of `Foogol'.
</pre><p>When reading the Info file with a viewer, you can issue a
simple command that will instruct the viewer to follow the
cross-reference. It is the cross-references that provide the
&ldquo;hypertext&rdquo; feel to the on-line Info reader. Cross-references are
typically references to other nodes within the current document,
but they don't have to be! A cross-reference to a node in another
Texinfo document can be followed, and the Info reader will go to it
just as easily as to a node in the current document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1322ca8"></a>Info Viewers</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to view Info files. (Remember, before you
can view a texinfo file, you must create it from the
<b  >.texi</b> file using either
<b  >makeinfo</b> or
<b  >texinfo-format-buffer</b>.) The first is the
stand-alone info viewer. This is a rather slick program, with menu
completion features, the ability to split the screen to view
multiple nodes, and much much more.</p><p>It requires a terminal or terminal emulator with cursor
motion facilities. If you can run vi or Emacs in your window, or on
your screen, then you can run info. The second is with the Info
major mode in GNU Emacs. The Emacs Info viewer has almost all the
features of the stand-alone info viewer, except the ability to
split the screen and view multiple nodes.</p><p>As mentioned, <b  >info</b> can also follow an
infinite chain of cross references, allowing you to browse
documentation to your heart's content.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1322fc0"></a>Miscellaneous Commands</h2></div></div><p>There are several miscellaneous features that should be
mentioned. First, you can write footnotes, using
<b  >@footnote{...}</b>. This creates real footnotes with
TeX and a collection of footnotes at the end of the node with Info.
If you absolutely must use fancy TeX features, then you can drop
into pure TeX mode by bracketing your text with
<b  >@tex</b> and <b  >@end tex</b>. In between
these two statements, you must write in pure TeX, with backslash as
the escape character, and so on.</p><p>Note that <b  >@tex</b> and <b  >@end
tex</b> are different from the <b  >@iftex ... @end
iftex</b> commands mentioned earlier, which conditionally
include text into the printed document.</p><p>Finally, there is a simple macro facility in Texinfo. Macros
can be set with <b  >@set</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@set EDITION 1.23
</pre><p>The value can be retrieved with
<b  >@value</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
This is Edition @value{EDITION} of ...
</pre><p>Macros can also be used as flags, for example to indicate if
a version is a draft or not. The flags can be tested with
<b  >@ifset ... @end ifset</b> and <b  >@ifclear ...
@end ifclear</b>, which test if the macro is set or not,
respectively.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@set DRAFT
@ifset DRAFT
@b{This is just a draft, please mark it up and send it back.}
@end ifset
@ifclear DRAFT
Welcome to Edition @value{EDITION} of ....
@end ifclear
</pre><p>The macro facility is particularly useful for the multiple
cases near the front of a document where the title, edition number,
and program version number are repeated. By using
<b  >@value</b> in all those places, you can use
<b  >@set</b> for the title, edition, and version, and
only have to update the numbers once. This is a true time
saver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x13237a8"></a>Getting Printed Documentation</h2></div></div><p>To generate printed documentation, you need to have TeX
installed on your system. The <b  >texinfo.tex</b> macros
need to be in TeX's macro directory. You will also need to install
a program named <b  >texindex</b>, that comes with the
Texinfo distribution, into a public <b  >bin</b>
directory, where everyone can get to it.</p><p>Texinfo files usually have a <b  >.texi</b>
extension. When TeX runs, it generates unsorted indices. The file
name for the unsorted indices match the Texinfo file's name, with
the <b  >.texi</b> replaced with the two-letter name of
the index. For example, the concept index for
<b  >foogol.texi</b> would be
<b  >foogol.cp</b>. The unsorted indices are not terribly
useful. The texindex program sorts the indices into new files,
whose names are the same as the index files, with an s on the end,
e.g., <b  >foogol.cps</b>. If these files exist,
<b  >texinfo.tex</b> will include them when TeX is run
again.</p><p>The typical sequence is to run TeX three times, running
texindex in between each run.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tex foogol.texi
$ texindex foogol.??
$ tex foogol.texi
$ texindex foogol.??
$ tex foogol.texi
</pre><p>The first run generates unsorted indices, and creates
<b  >foogol.aux</b>, which lists the page numbers of the
nodes. This information is used to fill in the cross-references.
The second run generates a complete DVI file, but unfortunately,
the cross-references in it could be off by a page or so. The third
run gets everything right, and at that point you can arrange to
print the file. Typically, this is done with
<b  >dvips</b>, to generate PostScript.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ dvips foogol.dvi -o foogol.ps
$ lpr foogol.ps       # or however you print
</pre><p>The Texinfo distribution comes with a shell script named
<b  >texi2dvi</b> that will figure out how many times TeX
should be run. If it has been installed, it is probably the easiest
thing to use.</p><p>If you don't have TeX, another option is to use a separate
package called <b  >texi2roff</b>. This reads Texinfo
files and generates Troff input that can be processed with GNU
Troff (<b  >groff</b>). You have your choice of Troff
macro packages, <b  >-me</b>, <b  >-ms</b>, and
<b  >-mm</b>.</p><p>TeX is preferred to <b  >texi2roff</b>, but at
least the latter is an option. The generated Troff may need some
massaging by hand, but should otherwise be fairly usable.
Unfortunately, the most recent version of
<b  >texi2roff</b> is considered obsolete, and is no
longer being distributed by the FSF.</p><p>Also of note is a package called LaTexinfo, which is a set of
LaTeX macros and a modified version of makeinfo for doing the same
thing as <b  >texinfo.tex</b> and the regular
<b  >makeinfo</b>. Texinfo files are not compatible with
LaTexinfo, unfortunately. Use archie to find a recent copy of
LaTexinfo if you prefer to use LaTeX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1638850"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Texinfo provides a clean input language with everything
necessary for producing handsome printed documentation and highly
usable on-line hypertext help. The info viewer provides a friendly
interface for reading the on-line Info files.</p><p>The nicest thing I have found about Texinfo is that you don't
need to know TeX to use it. I have been happily writing in Texinfo
for around seven years, and have not really needed to learn TeX.
Even though Texinfo has over 160 commands, what I've covered in
this article is 95% of what most people would use on a day-to-day
basis.</p><p>I also recommend buying and reading the Texinfo manual from
the FSF. It is well-written and thorough. You will need to do this
anyway if you plan to write a large Texinfo file, as this article
has just scratched the surface. The Texinfo manual comes with the
Texinfo distribution, and is of course written in Texinfo; this
provides a nice example that uses all of Texinfo's features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1638a08"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to Miriam Robbins for making me clarify a number of
