    In previous columns Ian introduced the Debian system,
    explained the circumstances that led to its creation and
    detailed the motivations that keep the project alive. This
    month's column will tell the reader how and where to get
    Debian and what it has to offer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7b3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Debian differs from other Linux
distributions in many ways, a few of which are radical departures
from the ways distributions of the past were assembled. These
differences have attracted developers from around the world to work
together toward the common goal of making Debian the best Linux
distribution available. Indeed, one of the differences that has
attracted them is the fact that they <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> work
together.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7b500"></a>Open Development</h2></div></div><p>The most unique aspect of Debian development as compared to
other Linux distributions is the fact that it has been and
continues to be developed openly by a group of volunteers, and that
it is open to other volunteers who wish to join the effort. Debian
is not developed by one individual or a small, closed group.
Instead, it follows in the tradition of the Linux kernel; it is
developed by those who use it, and this makes for a higher quality,
more dynamic, and truly modular system.</p><p>Does this sound to you like an invitation to chaos?
Originally, many people claimed that the open development of the
Linux kernel was an invitation to chaos and disaster, yet Linux is
not a disaster. Neither is Debian, for a good reason.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7b660"></a>Modularity Of Debian Components</h2></div></div><p>As the Debian developers create their pieces, they follow
strict guidelines for constructing and maintaining these pieces,
called packages. Because these guidelines are followed, each
package can be dropped into the system independently without
damaging or interfering with programs from other packages. By
working with a set of consistent rules and with identical tools,
the volunteers can and do create a truly modular system.</p><p>Modularity is extremely important to such a large collection
of software as a distribution. New releases of the software that
comprise the distribution are constantly being made, and it is the
task of the distribution maintainer (or maintainers, in the case of
Debian) to keep this software well integrated with the rest of the
system and up to date. It is very difficult for the maintainer to
do this successfully with dozens of megabytes of software,
especially when the software is not written specifically for the
system. When one person or small group attempts to do this,
maintenance of the distribution soon becomes a nightmare.</p><p>A distribution with many different people responsible for the
maintenance of its packages does not suffer from this overwhelming
task; different people are able to devote more attention to the
packages they maintain than would otherwise be possible, and it is
possible for experts in a particular area to take responsibility
for the packages involving their area of expertise. The result is a
better, more timely set of packages, complete with up-to-date
components, full documentation and solid examples. A collection of
such independent but highly cooperative packages makes a high
quality, consistent, modular distribution, which is exactly what
Debian is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7b818"></a>FSSTND Compliance</h2></div></div><p>Debian was the first Linux system to adopt, support and
participate in the construction of the Linux Filesystem Standard
(FSSTND); since that time, Debian has been joined by Linux/PRO,
MCC, Slackware, TAMU, and other major distributions. FSSTND
compliance means full compatibility with the distributions that
follow it, easy integration of third-party packages and easy
installation of the system into a network of FSSTND-compliant Linux
machines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7b920"></a>Ease Of Installation And Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Debian was designed to be simple enough for the novice to
install and configure, yet not so simple-minded as to frustrate the
advanced user. The installation process is as modular as the system
itself; the base system, which requires less than 7MB of disk
space, can be installed in less than ten minutes. All packages are
installed independently of the base system with the Debian package
maintenance utility, dpkg.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7ba28"></a>Intelligent And Powerful Package
Maintenance</h2></div></div><p>A new package maintenance system called dpkg has been
developed specifically for the Debian system. With dpkg, the
administrator of a Debian system can easily install, remove,
upgrade and obtain information about both installed and
not-yet-installed packages.</p><p><b  >dpkg</b> is being written to easily and
extensibly support multiple package formats, and it is planned to
eventually support (at least) Slackware and System V
packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7bbe0"></a>Built-In System Upgradability</h2></div></div><p>Since the beginning of the project, Debian has been designed
with up-gradability in mind. Every component of the system can be
easily upgraded with just a few simple tools. Packages installed
with dpkg can be easily upgraded. All one needs to do is install
any upgrade package normally, just as if installing it for the
first time, and dpkg will automatically detect that an older
version of the package is installed on the system and ask for
confirmation that it should be upgraded. dpkg takes care of the
rest, asking whether to replace configuration files, and notifying
the user in the unlikely event that any manual steps need to be
taken after the upgrade has been completed.</p><p>Similarly, the base system is upgradable, albeit by a
slightly different method. Periodically, the Debian Linux
Association will release upgrade packages to the latest release of
the base system. Usually this will involve executing a script or a
similar task. The upgrade process will always be simple and will
usually be fully-automated.</p><p>The key point to make about upgradability in Debian is that
the user need only install the base system once. Upgrade packages
to the base system will be provided when a new version of the
distribution is released, and packages in dpkg format will always
be upgradable. In summary, the entire system will be upgradable
with an absolute minimum amount of work on the user's part.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d83580.0x1e7bd98"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>The current release of Debian may be found at the Internet
FTP site sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/ distributions/debian. It is
