    How can a commercial editor compete with all the free
    products that the Linux Community has access to? In this
    article, Robert Broughton helps us decide whether to spend
    our money on this Brief-turned-shareware-turned-commercial
    editor.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a30580.0x2b28450"></a></h2></div></div><p>First, a history lesson. Crisp was
originally a shareware product, written by Paul Fox, of London, UK.
It is a clone of Brief, an MS-DOS product marketed by Borland, and
was originally released in 1988. The last shareware release, 2.2e,
was in 1991. Fox, who is also known to the Linux community as the
initiator of the NOTIF project, was disappointed with the low
shareware income. He was also aware that he had an excellent
product on his hands. So, version 3 of Crisp was released in 1992
as a commercial product; the initial Linux version is 4.1.9. It is
available on a number of platforms, including Sun, AIX, SCO, HP,
Univel, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT. Both character and X-Windows
versions are available for Linux.</p><p>The original designer of Brief paid a great deal of attention
to ergonomics. Crisp is easy to learn: the only thing you really
need to know to get started is that &lt;alt&gt;x saves files and
exits. Once you've got that down, &lt;alt&gt;l is used to block
lines, and &lt;alt&gt;c is used to block columns. The + key on the
numeric keypad is used to copy a block, and the - key on the
numeric keypad is used to cut a block. If no block is defined, the
current line is copied or cut. Blocks are then inserted using the
&lt;insert&gt; key. The &lt;home&gt; key takes the cursor to the
beginning of the current line, and the &lt;end&gt; key takes the
cursor to the end of the current line. &lt;PageUp&gt;,
&lt;PageDown&gt;, and the &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; keys perform their obvious
functions. &lt;alt&gt;h gives you help.</p><p>To list all of the features of Crisp would make this a very
long article. It has just about all of the capabilities of Emacs,
but it is, in my opinion, much more user-friendly than Emacs. It's
easier to customize, and the documentation and on-line help are
much easier to deal with. It is
<span   class="bold"><b>much</b></span> easier to install. Both Crisp
and Emacs have macro languages, but Crisp's is C-like, as opposed
to the lisp language for Emacs. From my personal point of view,
Crisp has one key feature that Emacs lacks: when you exit Crisp, it
remembers all of the files that you were editing, the position of
the cursor in each file, and, for the X-Windows version, the size
of the window. Not only that, but it keeps a separate &ldquo;record&rdquo; for
each working directory that you edit files in. You can edit one set
of files in directory /a, save and exit, cd to directory /b, edit
another set of files, save and exit, and cd back to /a, and edit
the first set of files without losing your place. Even search
strings are carried over.</p><p>Version 2.2e (the final shareware version) has been ported to
Linux. It can be found on <b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b>, in
<b  >/pub/Linux/apps/editors</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a30580.0x2b28768"></a>The Character Version</h2></div></div><p>At first glance, the look and feel of the current version of
Crisp is not very different from the old shareware version. The
first thing you'll notice that's different is that if you're
editing a C program, the comments will be in a different color from
the rest of the text. The big difference comes when you press
&lt;F5&gt; to do a search: you can recall previous search strings
by pressing the &lt;up-arrow&gt; key. Also, searches can &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; as
they do in vi. The &ldquo;context memory&rdquo; works better: the shareware
version remembered only the last file edited, but the commercial
version remembers all files. The commercial version has optional
pull-down menus.</p><p>There are other improvements that are less obvious, but very
important. The on-line help has a professional look, rather than a
shareware look, and the product is generally tighter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a30580.0x2b288c8"></a>The X-Windows Version</h2></div></div><p>The shareware version of Crisp includes an X-Windows version,
but Paul Fox describes it as &ldquo;How I Learned to do X-Windows
Programming&rdquo;. It works OK, but it's very rudimentary: no menus or
icons, and the mouse support is incomplete.</p><p>The Linux commercial version uses XView. Crisp has been
implemented with Motif on some other platforms. This was not done
for Linux for practical business reasons: the number of Linux users
that have purchased Motif libraries is small, and of these, the
number who would shell out money to purchase Crisp would be even
smaller.</p><p>I regard this as a minor drawback. I have an SCO system at
work, and use the Motif version of Crisp on it eight or nine hours
a day. I prefer the Motif look-and-feel over XView, although people
with Sun backgrounds may feel differently.</p><p>Anyway, I said &ldquo;minor&rdquo; drawback. The XView version certainly
works, and Crisp has been designed to take maximum advantage of
this environment. The mouse can be used to move the cursor, and cut
and paste text. Above the text window is a row of color icons that
can be clicked to activate the most commonly used functions:
search/replace, switching files, recording and playing macros, etc.
At the top of the Crisp window is a set of pull-down menus that can
be used to do anything (as far as I know) that Crisp is capable of
doing, including make, grep, and reading e-mail. There are vertical
and horizontal scroll-bars for text editing and on-line help
windows. There's an option for a separate &ldquo;toolkit&rdquo; window with a
more extensive set of mouse-activated commands. It is possible to
peel off additional editing windows.</p><p>There are also dialog boxes for functions like opening files
and search/replace. The dialog boxes, fortunately, are
configurable. I suspect that most users will want the dialog boxes
turned on when they are learning their way around Crisp, and they
will gradually turn them off. One reason is that you can get more
work done without the dialog boxes. Another reason is that if you
have a window manager that always makes the window under the cursor
the active window (I use fvwm), you may type something like a file
name into a dialog box, and discover that you have accidentally
edited your text instead, because the mouse was pointing in the
wrong place.</p><p>The major &ldquo;ooh, ahh&rdquo; feature for the X-Windows version of
Crisp is colorization. As with the character version, comments are
shaded. Language keywords, such as if, case, and int, appear in
blue. Strings appear in red. These color choices are customizable,
and there are, of course, templates for languages other than C,
including Ada, COBOL, and SQL.</p><p>Crisp has vi emulation. With the X-Windows version, the vi
commands and the GUI features are interchangeable.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2829f1.large.jpg"><img src="2829f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Some Additional Features
</p></div></div><p>As I said, discussing all of the features of Crisp would make
this a very long article. I will mention a few that I don't have
any personal experience with, but the developers are very proud
of.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PostScript program listings: If you have a
PostScript printer, or ghostscript, Crisp will attempt to simulate
the language colorization by using shading, boldface, etc. If you
have a color PostScript printer, you'll get a really fancy
listing.</p></li><li><p>Filter mechanism: Clicking an icon will execute a
predefined command, such as a compiler, and the contents of the
current file become the input to that command. Crisp opens another
window, and the output of the command appears in that
window.</p></li><li><p>Asynchronous mechanism: External programs can write
commands that Crisp can understand, such as &ldquo;edit__file&rdquo; or
&ldquo;goto_line&rdquo; to a file named cr.async. The external program can then
send signal -16 or -17 to the Crisp process, and Crisp will execute
the commands. (If your external program cannot send signals, it's
possible to configure Crisp to look for the cr.async file every few
seconds.)</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a30580.0x2b29058"></a>The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>Crisp is sold with a variety of license arrangements. The one
that will be of interest to most Linux users will be the
single-user, single-execution license. The price for this will
probably be $99US for either the character or</p><p>X-Windows version, and the manual (useful, but not essential)
will be another $40. The international agent</p><p>for Crisp is Vital, and they can be reached by e-mail at
