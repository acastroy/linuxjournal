I use my Raspberry Pi as a low-cost IPv6 router and tunnel
endpoint to provide IPv6 connectivity to my entire home LAN. Using
SixXS as my tunnel provider, I configured my Raspberry Pi to be completely
LAN-agnostic, which means I don't have to worry about my ISP changing
my public IPv4 address. I even can take my Raspberry Pi IPv6 router to
friends' houses to make their networks IPv6-capable as well.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151b580.0x1613250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
IPv6 is the next-generation IP protocol designed to deal
with the address exhaustion we are facing with IPv4. IPv6
addresses are 128 bits long, which is enough to address
340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 individual devices.
</p><p>
You can do some unique things with IPv6 today. Here's a short list:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Access Google, Facebook and Wikipedia over IPv6.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid using dynamic DNS to access your home/office computers when on the go.
</p></li><li><p>
Get IPv6 certification from Hurricane Electric (<a href="http://ipv6.he.net/certification" target="_self">ipv6.he.net/certification</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Use IPv6-capable equipment for anything from teleconferencing to sensor networks
(<a href="https://www.sixxs.net/misc/toys" target="_self">https://www.sixxs.net/misc/toys</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Watch <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> in ASCII over IPv6: Telnet to
towel.blinkenlights.nl:23 (technically you can do this over IPv4
as well.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For a more comprehensive list of what you can do, see
<a href="https://www.sixxs.net/misc/coolstuff" target="_self">https://www.sixxs.net/misc/coolstuff</a>.
</p><p>
There are many ways to get IPv6 connectivity, including getting native
support from your ISP or setting up a tunnel using an IPv6 tunnel
broker. Because most ISPs are slow to provide native IPv6 support, let's
set up a tunnel using SixXS (pronounced &ldquo;six access&rdquo;) and a Raspberry
Pi. SixXS is a major IPv6 tunnel provider that supports a number of
tunneling protocols.
</p><p>
A Raspberry Pi is a low-cost single-board computer that you can obtain
for $25 or $35. It runs Linux on its ARM-based processor and is powerful
enough to act as an IPv6 router without breaking a sweat. There are many
uses for a Raspberry Pi&mdash;from a Web server to an XBMC-based media center
or a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minecraft</em></span> gaming rig.
</p><p>
For the purposes of this article, I assume that you have a
LAN with a single dynamic IPv4 address from your ISP and that you
already have a Raspberry Pi and are running Raspbian,
the de facto standard Linux distribution for it. You can find
documentation for how to get started with the Raspberry Pi elsewhere
(<a href="http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiBoard" target="_self">elinux.org/RaspberryPiBoard</a>). I further assume that your
Raspberry Pi is a model B, which has a built-in Ethernet port. You 
certainly can use a Model A, but you will need to add a USB Ethernet or a
Wi-Fi USB adapter to it first.
</p><p>
As I mentioned, SixXS supports a few different kinds of tunnel protocols,
but we are interested only in one: Anything-In-Anything (AYIYA). This
protocol is essentially IPv6 packets wrapped in IPv4/UDP datagrams. It
has the nice property that it traverses most NAT setups without any special
configuration required on the router. Additionally, when you use AYIYA
with SixXS's autoconfiguration client (AICCU), you avoid using any
LAN-specific configuration. This means once you have everything set
up, you can take your Raspberry Pi IPv6 router anywhere. Just power it
up on your friend's LAN, and it instantly becomes IPv6 connected! Let's
get started.
</p><p>
1) Register for an account with SixXS
(<a href="https://www.sixxs.net/signup/create" target="_self">https://www.sixxs.net/signup/create</a>). This is a multistep process
(<a href="https://www.sixxs.net/faq/account/?faq=10steps" target="_self">https://www.sixxs.net/faq/account/?faq=10steps</a>) where some steps will
require manual approval from one of the SixXS members, but it normally
goes pretty quickly. Once you have registered for an account, you can
request a tunnel and a subnet. You will need to provide a reason explaining why
you want to use IPv6 through SixXS. Provide as detailed a reason as you
can, but it might just boil down to &ldquo;I want to get my local network IPv6-enabled to familiarize myself with
how IPv6 works.&rdquo; Make sure to select
AYIYA for the tunnel type.
</p><p>
2) Enable IPv6 routing on your Raspberry Pi:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1" | 
 &#8618;sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ sudo sysctl -p
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Once your request is approved, you will have addresses for a tunnel
and a subnet. The tunnel address is what your Raspberry Pi will use to
communicate with SixXS. You will use the subnet to hand out addresses to
the rest of the devices on your LAN. Keep the Tunnel Information page
open while you are proceeding with the setup. Be patient. Typically,
SixXS reviews tunnel requests within a few hours to a few days.
</p><p>
4) Because every IPv6-capable device on your network immediately
will receive a globally accessible IPv6 address, you need to set up a firewall
to protect them. Indeed, not all devices (such as printers) come with
a firewall, so it is a good idea to limit connectivity to them from the
outside world. This is done using a few ip6tables commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -m conntrack 
  &#8618;--ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -s 2001:4830:xxxx:xxx::/64 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -s 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::/64 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -p ipv6-icmp -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -j DROP
   
$ sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -m conntrack 
  &#8618;--ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -s 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::/64 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -p ipv6-icmp -j ACCEPT
$ sudo ip6tables -A FORWARD -j DROP
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that we are letting two IPv6 subnets through: 2001:4830:xxxx:xxx::/64
and 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::/64. The one with the Yxxx is going to be the
routed subnet. That's the one the rest of the devices on your
network will use. The one with just the xxx will have only two addresses
on it: ::1 (the remote end of your tunnel) and ::2 (your Raspberry Pi).
</p><p>
5) Make sure your firewall is enabled at boot time, which is easy.
Put the following into /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ip6tables-load, and make
it executable (<tt  >$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/ip6tables-load</tt>):

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
ip6tables-restore &lt; /etc/ip6tables.rules
exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, put the following into /etc/network/if-post-down.d/ip6tables-save
and make it executable (<tt  >$ sudo chmod 755
/etc/network/if-post-down.d/ip6tables-save</tt>):

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
ip6tables-save -c &gt; /etc/ip6tables.rules
   
if [ -f /etc/ip6tables.downrules ]; then
    ip6tables-restore &lt; /etc/ip6tables.downrules
fi
exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
For good measure, execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo /etc/network/if-post-down.d/ip6tables-save
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Now that your firewall is up and running, let's bring up the IPv6
tunnel. All you need to do is install the SixXS client called from the
standard Raspbian. The package is called aiccu.
</p><p>
During the installation process, you will be asked a few questions, such
as your tunnel ID (for example, T1110xx), your SixXS user name and password and so on.
Note that you can set up a tunnel-specific password to avoid having
your general SixXS password in plain text on your Raspberry Pi. After
the installation is complete, the configuration file will be generated
at /etc/aiccu.conf.
</p><p>
After AICCU is installed and running, you will have two new network
interfaces available: sit0 and sixxs. sit0 is the IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel,
and sixxs is a virtual Ethernet interface that has the IPv6 tunnel
address. You can check for these by running <tt  >$ ip addr</tt>.
</p><p>
At this point, your Raspberry Pi has IPv6 connectivity, which you can
check by pinging an IPv6-capable host:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ping6 google.com
</pre>
</p><p>
7) The next step is to provide IPv6 addresses to the rest of your network
using the routed subnet. First, edit your /etc/aiccu.conf and enable the
&ldquo;setupscript&rdquo; option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-#setupscript /usr/local/etc/aiccu-subnets.sh
+setupscript /usr/local/etc/aiccu-subnets.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create the script at /usr/local/etc/aiccu-subnets.sh with the
following content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
ip addr add 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::1/64 dev eth0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151b580.0x1614698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::1 is your routed subnet address. Next,
restart AICCU. Check the output of <tt  >$ ip addr</tt>, and make sure that
2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::1 is an address associated with your eth0 interface.
</p><p>
8) The last step is to install radvd, the router advertising d&aelig;mon,
and configure it to advertise to your LAN. After the installation is
complete, make sure that /etc/radvd.conf has the following content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface eth0 { 
    AdvSendAdvert on;
    MinRtrAdvInterval 3; 
    MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
       
    prefix 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::/64 { 
        AdvOnLink on; 
        AdvAutonomous on; 
        AdvRouterAddr on; 
   
        AdvValidLifetime 30;
        AdvPreferredLifetime 20;
    };
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Restart radvd, and check that IPv6 is available on other devices on your
network. Most modern computers will pick up the change immediately.
</p><p>
Going forward, AICCU will detect any changes to your LAN automatically,
such as an updated public IPv4 address from your ISP, and re-adjust the
tunnel settings. Your Raspberry Pi is now accessible from anywhere in
the world using its IPv6 address at 2001:4830:xxxx:Yxxx::1. Your other
devices will get their own public static IPv6 addresses. You can use
an IPv6 connectivity test at <a href="http://test-ipv6.com" target="_self">test-ipv6.com</a> to make sure that
everything works.
</p><p>
As an experiment, you can bring your Raspberry Pi to a friend's house
to see if you can make the network IPv6-capable there.
</p><p>
Once you get this basic setup up and running, you can build on top of
it. For example, you can provide your network with a local caching DNS
server that can resolve hostnames over IPv6 by simply installing
bind9.
</p><p>
You also can look into other types of tunnels, such as static
tunnels, or heartbeat tunnels from SixXS. Or, you could take a
look at tunnel providers other than SixXS, such as Hurricane
Electric's Tunnel Broker (<a href="https://tunnelbroker.net" target="_self">https://tunnelbroker.net</a>) or the Freenet6
(<a href="http://www.gogo6.com/freenet6" target="_self">www.gogo6.com/freenet6</a>).
</p><p>
You can use your Raspberry Pi as a Web server, serving content over
IPv6. Apache2 and nginx both support IPv6 out of the box, and many guides
are available for turning your Raspberry Pi into a Web server.
</p><p>
Another thing to try is setting up VoIPv6 on your Raspberry Pi with VOVIDA
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7047" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7047</a>).
</p><p>
In conclusion, using IPv6 opens up a world of new possibilities and lets
you do things you could not do before. Give it a try and have fun.
