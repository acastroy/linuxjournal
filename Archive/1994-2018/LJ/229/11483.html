Want to speed up your Web application? Putting some tasks into the
background is likely to help.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f83b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
From my perspective, one of the best parts of being a Web developer is
the instant gratification. You write some code, and within minutes,
it can be used by people around the world, all accessing your
server via a Web browser. The rapidity with which you can go from an
idea to development to deployment to actual users benefiting from
(and reacting to) your work is, in my experience, highly motivating.
</p><p>
Users also enjoy the speed with which new developments are deployed.
In the world of Web applications, users no longer need to consider,
download or install the &ldquo;latest version&rdquo; of a program; when they load
a page into their browser, they automatically get the latest version.
Indeed, users have come to expect that new features will be rolled out
on a regular basis. A Web application that fails to change and
improve over time quickly will lose ground in users' eyes.
</p><p>
Another factor that users consider is the speed with which a Web
application responds to their clicks. We are increasingly spoiled by
the likes of Amazon and Google, which not only have many thousands of
servers at their disposal, but which also tune their applications and
servers for the maximum possible response time. We measure the speed
of our Web applications in milliseconds, not in seconds, and in just
the past few years, we have reached the point when taking even one
second to respond to a user is increasingly unacceptable.
</p><p>
The drive to provide ever-greater speed to users has led to a
number of techniques that reduce the delays they encounter. One
of the simplest is that of a delayed job. Instead of trying to do
everything within the span of a single user request, put some of it
aside until later.
</p><p>
For example, let's say you are working on a Web application that
implements an address book and calendar. If a user asks to see all of
his or her appointments for the coming week, you almost certainly could
display them right away. But if a user asks to see all appointments
during the coming year, it might take some time to retrieve that from the
database, format it into HTML and then send it to the user's browser.
</p><p>
One solution is to break the problem into two or more
parts. Rather than having the Web application render the entire
response together, including the list of appointments during the
coming year, you can return an HTML page without any appointment.
However, that page can include a snippet of JavaScript that, after
the page is loaded, sends a request to the server asking for the
list. In this way, you can render the outline of the page, filling it
with data as it comes in.
</p><p>
Sometimes, you can't divide jobs in this way. For example, let's say
that when you add a new appointment to your calendar, you would like
the system to send e-mail to each of the participants, indicating that
they should add the meeting to their calendars. Sending e-mail
doesn't take a long time, but it does require some effort on the part
of the server. If you have to send e-mail to a large number of users,
the wait might be intolerably long&mdash;or just annoyingly long,
depending on your users and the task at hand.
</p><p>
Thus, for several years, developers have taken advantage of various
&ldquo;delayed jobs&rdquo; mechanisms, making it possible to say, &ldquo;Yes, I want to
execute this functionality, but later on, in a separate thread or
process from the handling of an HTTP request.&rdquo; Delaying the job in
like this may well mean that it'll take longer for the work to be
completed. But, no one will mind if the e-mail takes an additional 30
seconds to be sent. Users certainly will mind, by contrast, if it
takes an additional 30 seconds to send an HTTP response to the users'
browser. And in the world of the Web, users 
probably will not complain, but rather move on to another site.
</p><p>
This month, I explore the use of delayed jobs, taking a particular
look at Sidekiq, a Ruby gem (and accompanying server) written by Mike
Perham that provides this functionality using a different approach
from some of its predecessors. If you're like me, you'll find that
using background jobs is so natural and easy, it quickly becomes
part of your day-to-day toolbox for creating Web applications&mdash;whether you're sending many e-mail messages, converting files from one
format to another or producing large reports that may take time to
process, background jobs are a great addition to your arsenal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f88d8"></a>
Background Queues</h2></div></div><p>
Before looking at Sidekiq in particular, let's consider what is
necessary for background jobs to work, at least in an object-oriented
language like Ruby. The basic idea is that you create a class with a
single method, called &ldquo;perform&rdquo;, that does what you want to execute.
For example, you could do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class MailSender
    def perform(user)
        send_mail_to_user(user)
    end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming that the <tt  >send_mail_to_user</tt> method has been
defined in your
system, you can send e-mail with something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MailSender.new.perform(user)
</pre>
</p><p>
But here's the thing: you won't ever actually execute that code.
Indeed, you won't ever create an instance of MailSender directly.
Rather, you'll invoke a class method, something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MailSender.perform_async(user)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the difference. Here, the class method takes the parameter that
you eventually want to be passed to the &ldquo;perform&rdquo; method. But the
&ldquo;perform_async&rdquo; class method instead stores the request on a queue.
At some point in the future, a separate process (or thread) will
review method calls that have been stored in the queue, executing them
one by one, separately and without any connection to the HTTP
requests.
</p><p>
Now, the first place you might consider queuing method classes that
you'll want to execute would be in the database. Most modern Web
applications use a database of some sort, and that would be a natural
first thought. And indeed, in the Ruby world, there have been such gems as
&ldquo;delayed job&rdquo; and &ldquo;background job&rdquo; that do indeed use the database as
a queue.
</p><p>
The big problem with this technique, however, is that the queue
doesn't need all of the functionality that a database can provide. You
can get away with something smaller and lighter, without all the
transactional and data-safety features. A second reason not to use
the database is to split the load. If your Web application is working
hard, you'll probably want to let the database be owned and used
by the Web application, without distracting it with your queue.
</p><p>
So, it has become popular to use non-relational databases, aka
NoSQL solutions, as queues for background jobs. One particularly
popular choice is Redis, the super-fast, packed-with-functionality
NoSQL store that works something like a souped-up memcached. The
first job queue to use Redis in the Ruby world was Resque, which
continues to be popular and effective.
</p><p>
But as applications have grown in size and scope, so too have the
requirements for performance. Resque is certainly good enough for
most purposes, but Sidekiq attempts to go one better. It also uses
Redis as a back-end store, and it even uses the same storage format as
Resque, so that you either can share a Redis instance between Resque
and Sidekiq or transition from one to the other easily. But,
the big difference is that Sidekiq uses threads, whereas Resque uses
processes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f8fb8"></a>
Threads? In Ruby?</h2></div></div><p>
Threading in Ruby is something of a sore subject. On the one hand,
threads in Ruby are super-easy to work with. If you want to execute
something in a thread, you just create a new Thread object, handing
it a block containing the code you want to execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Thread.new do
    STDERR.puts "Hello!"  # runs in a new thread
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is that people who come from languages like Java 
often are surprised to hear that although Ruby threads are full-fledged
system threads, they also have a global interpreter lock (GIL), which
prevents more than one thread from executing at a time. This means that
if you spawn 20 threads, you will indeed have 20 threads, but the
GIL acts as a big mutex, ensuing that no more than one thread is
executing simultaneously. Thread execution typically switches for
I/O, and given that nearly every program uses I/O on a regular basis, this
almost ensures that each thread will be given a chance to execute.
</p><p>
I should note that Ruby isn't the only language with these issues.
Python also has a GIL, and Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, has
indicated that although he certainly wants Python to support threading,
he personally prefers the ease and security of processes. Because
processes don't share state, they are less prone to difficult-to-debug
problems, without sacrificing too much in execution speed.
</p><p>
Sidekiq is threaded, but it uses a different model for threads than
most Rubyists are used to. It uses Celluloid, an
&ldquo;actor-based&rdquo;
threading system that packages the threads inside objects, avoiding
most or all of the issues associated with threads. Moreover,
Celluloid expects to run in JRuby or Rubinius, two alternative Ruby
implementations, which have true threading and lack the GIL.
Celluloid-based applications, such as Sidekiq, will work just fine
under the standard Ruby interpreter, known as the MRI, but you won't
enjoy all of the speed or threading benefits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f92d0"></a>
Using Sidekiq</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's see how this overview of a delayed job can be implemented in
Sidekiq. First and foremost, you'll need to install the Redis NoSQL
store. Redis is available from a variety of sources; I was able to
install it on my Ubuntu-based machine with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install redis   # check this
</pre>
</p><p>
Once Redis is installed, you'll want to install the &ldquo;sidekiq&rdquo; gem.
Again, it'll give you the best functionality if you run it under JRuby
or Rubinius, but you can run it under the standard Ruby interpreter
as well. Just realize that the threads will give you non-optimal
performance. You can install the gem with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install sidekiq -V
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're running the Ruby Version Manager (RVM), as I do, you
don't want to install the gem as root. Instead, you should just type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install sidekiq -V
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f95e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(I always like to use the <tt  >-V</tt> flag, so I can see the details of
the gem as it is installed.)
</p><p>
You can use Sidekiq in any Ruby application. However, most of my work
is in Rails, and I imagine you're going to want to use it in
Rails, Sinatra or a similar Web application. Thus, let's create a
simple Rails application so you can try it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails new appointments
</pre>
</p><p>
Within the new &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; directory, you'll then create an
&ldquo;appointment&rdquo; resource with scaffolding&mdash;a combination of model,
controller and view that can get you going quickly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g scaffold appointment name:text 
 &#8618;meeting_at:timestamp notes:text
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that is done, you have to run the migration, creating the
appropriate &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; table in your database. In this case,
because you didn't specify a database, you'll use SQLite, which is good
enough for this toy example.
</p><p>
Now you can fire up your application (<tt  >rails s</tt>) and go to
/appointments. From that URL, you can create, view, edit and delete
appointments. However, the point is not to create appointments, but rather
delay the execution of something having to do with them. Let's do
something extremely simple, such as sending e-mail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g mailer notifications
</pre>
</p><p>
Inside app/mailers/notifications.rb, add the following method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def appointment_info(person, appointment)
    @person = person
    @appointment = appointment
    mail(to:person.email, subject:"Appointment update")
    end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
And, inside app/views/notifications/appointment_info.html.erb, write
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;Hello! You have an appointment with &lt;%= @person %&gt;
at &lt;%= @appointment.meeting_at %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, let's tie it all together, sending your notification, from
within your AppointmentWorker class. There's no rule for where the
file defining such a class needs to be put, but it seems increasingly
standard to have it in app/workers, in part because files under app
are all loaded when Rails starts up:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class AppointmentWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(appointment)
    Notifications.deliver_appointment_info(appointment)
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice several things here. First, the class doesn't inherit
from anything special. Sidekiq doesn't use inheritance, but rather
has you include a module&mdash;a class without instances, in Ruby&mdash;whose
methods then are available to instances of your class. This is how the
perform_async method is defined on you class. Through a little bit of
magic, importing a module can define both class and instance methods.
</p><p>
Now all you have to do is change your controller, such that after you
create a report, you also send a notification:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AppointmentWorker.perform_async(@appointment)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you're not passing the ID of the appointment, but the
appointment object itself! Sidekiq uses Ruby's built-in serialization
facility to store nearly any sort of object, not just numeric IDs.
The object and method call are stored in Redis, until they are
retrieved by a Sidekiq process.
</p><p>
Indeed, that's the final part of Sidekiq that you need to get in place:
the back-end process that will look through the delayed jobs, running
each one in turn as it gets to them. Fortunately, running that is as
easy as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bundle exec sidekiq
</pre>
</p><p>
Yup, that's all you need to do. True, there are some options you
can set, but generally speaking, this starts up a Sidekiq server that
looks at the current queue (as stored in Redis), grabs a job off
the queue and processes it. You can configure Sidekiq to run with a
timeout or with a specified number of retries, and you even can say how
many concurrent workers (that is, threads) you want to be working
simultaneously.
</p><p>
Remember that although these are indeed threads, Sidekiq (via
Celluloid) ensures that they don't have any state in common. Of
course, you need to be sure that your worker methods are thread-safe,
such that even if a worker gets through 90% of its job and is then
halted, it'll be able to restart without any penalties or errors.
Thus, your processes must be transactional, just as you would expect
from a database query.
</p><p>
There are other ways to schedule Sidekiq jobs, besides defining
methods within a module, as in the above example. If there's an
existing method that you want to run as a background process, just
insert the &ldquo;delay&rdquo; method before the actual method call. That is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my_object.delay.do_something_big
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are using Rails and the built-in ActiveSupport module for easy
time descriptions, you even can do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my_object.delay_for(5.days).do_something_big
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x2af24f0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Sidekiq has become quite popular in the Ruby community since it was
released, in no small part because of its high performance, easy
installation and ease of use. It also works with commercial hosting
services, such as Heroku, assuming that you first install a Redis
instance.
</p><p>
Working with delayed jobs changes your perspective of the Web
somewhat&mdash;you realize that not everything needs to take place
immediately. Rather, you can delay certain jobs, putting them in the
background, allowing your Web server to respond to users faster than
otherwise would be the case. And, when speed is such a crucial element
of Web application success, prudent use of Sidekiq likely will make a
big difference.
