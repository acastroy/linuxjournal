What you should know if you are deploying open source in the cloud.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9f2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Since the emergence of strong cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services,
Google and Rackspace, software development and deployment is increasingly taking
place in the cloud. According to Gartner, cloud computing is expected to grow
at a rate of 19% this year. Big industry players including Netflix and eBay
already have turned to the cloud for significant proportions of their operations
and offerings. And in the next few years, we are likely to see more and more
innovative startups like Coupa completely suspended in the cloud, relegating
on-premise computing to a vestige of a bygone era.
</p><p>
While enterprises are shifting from legacy solutions toward the cloud, open-source software is gaining significant traction for similar reasons. Gartner
projects that 99% of Global 2000 companies will incorporate open source into
their operations by 2016. Adopters of both cloud and open-source solutions are
drawn toward the increased potential for collaboration and lower total cost of
ownership.
</p><p>
The proliferation of open-source cloud projects (think OpenStack, CloudStack,
Eucalyptus) and increasing use of open-source software within the cloud
suggests a need for enterprises to understand how the cloud environment impacts
open-source license compliance. Before the emergence of the cloud, restrictive
open-source licenses maintained software freedom through the regulation of
distribution. However, because software is provided as a service in the cloud,
licensing obligations that are linked to the act of distribution no longer
apply. This has led to the development of newer cloud-driven restrictive open-source
licenses, such as the AGPL. The game-changing effect of the cloud on
traditional open-source compliance mechanisms and the subsequent development of
remedial open-source licenses calls for organizations to audit and update their
intellectual property policies to minimize the risk of infringement.

The Traditional Proprietary vs. Open-Source Battle and the Rise of Permissive and
Restrictive Licenses</h2></div></div><p>
The emergence of cloud computing and its impact on open-source compliance has
reignited the historical battle between proprietary and open-source software,
and reinforced traditional divisions within the Open Source community. The
genesis of the proprietary vs. open-source debate dates back to the unbundling of
IBM in the mid-1970s, after which it was no longer possible for users to access
and modify code. Although user freedoms were removed through the process of
unbundling, programmers continued to find ways to access, modify and share code,
famously prompting Bill Gates to write his &ldquo;Open Letter to
Hobbyists&rdquo; after
Microsoft's Basic was leaked. 
</p><p>
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Open Source movement emerged in two
distinct factions, the first of which was headed by Richard Stallman, a former
programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Stallman's belief that
the ability to access, modify and redistribute code is a fundamental freedom led
to his development of the GNU project, which was licensed under the GPL&mdash;a
restrictive license specifically designed to ensure that GNU code could not be
rendered proprietary when incorporated in derivative works. 
</p><p>
Around the same time, the BSD UNIX system was being developed by the Computer
Science Research Group at Berkeley. In the late 1990s, the BSD UNIX became
available under the BSD license. While Stallman's GPL was designed as a
restrictive copyleft license aimed at preventing the underlying code from
becoming proprietary, the BSD was drafted as a permissive license that would
enable users to embed the underlying code into proprietary offerings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9f6c8"></a>
Permissive vs. Restrictive Open-Source Licenses in the Pre-Cloud Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Licenses that cover open-source code carry unique terms that have implications
on code use, modification and distribution. As previously mentioned, there are
two broad categories of open-source licenses&mdash;the permissive and
restrictive types. Permissive licenses, such as the MIT and BSD licenses, provide
minimal obligations on code use, modification and distribution, enabling
developers to incorporate open-source code into proprietary software, which they
then could protect by adding additional license terms.
</p><p>
In contrast, restrictive open-source licenses, such as the GPL, do not allow users
of covered code to release derivative works under different license terms. In
addition, these restrictive licenses require users that distribute modified
programs to make their source code available to downstream users, in order to
maintain the copyleft community's goal of achieving software freedom. This
concept of software freedom refers to the right of all downstream users to
access, run, modify and redistribute software containing the covered code.
This
feature of restrictive licenses renders it impossible to incorporate open-source
code into proprietary offerings. There is no way to avoid these stringent
rules, and the failure to comply with such obligations can lead to severe
consequences, including being forced to come into compliance by releasing the
asset's source code or paying damages for intellectual property
infringement.
</p><p>
In the pre-cloud environment, software vendors made their products available to
end users through software distribution. Because there was no other means of
making software available to users, it was impossible for vendors to escape the
distribution clauses in restrictive open-source licenses. However, this has
changed with the introduction of cloud computing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9f880"></a>
Cloud Computing's Challenge to the Distribution-Based GPL Model</h2></div></div><p>
Restrictive open-source licenses, such as the GPL, operate to maintain
software freedom only to the extent that the underlying open-source code is part of a
distribution. For example, the GPLv3 states that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software: responsibilities to
respect the freedom of others. If you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Before the emergence of the cloud, this license term
ensured that any time software incorporating covered code was deployed to
third parties, that distribution would be governed by the GPL terms such that
the distributor would be forced to make its code available to users. However,
the proliferation of cloud-based SaaS solutions threatened to destabilize the
GPL model by creating an environment in which for the first time software was
made available to users without being distributed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9fa90"></a>
GPL: Permissive within the Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
In instances where software containing GPL code is made available through
network services, the distribution clause is bypassed and the provider does not
have to release its source code. Remember the free software reciprocity
trigger: &ldquo;If you distribute copies of such a program...you must pass on to
the recipients the same freedoms that you received.&rdquo; However, because
software is not distributed in the cloud&mdash;it's simply made available to
users as a service&mdash;providers do not have to pay these freedoms
forward.
Rather, they can access the benefits of using free software without being forced
to provide those same benefits to their users. This loophole enables SaaS
enterprises to embed GPL-covered code into proprietary cloud offerings.
Effectively what this means is that, within this distribution-free model, the
GPL assumes the attributes of a permissive license (think MIT, BSD).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9fc48"></a>
AGPL: the Open-Source Empire Strikes Back</h2></div></div><p>
For anyone who thought that the cloud rendered the proprietary and open-source
debate moot, think again&mdash;the battle is far from over, it simply relocated
to another frontier. Before long, the copyleft faction of the Open Source
movement regrouped and responded to the threat that the cloud-based SaaS model
posed to its goal of maintaining software freedom. The weapon of choice that
the movement developed and deployed to respond to the unique challenges imposed
by the emerging cloud-based SaaS environment was the Affero GPLv3 (AGPLv3), which
covers popular applications such as PHP-Fusion, Launchpad and SugarCRM. 
</p><p>
Unlike the GPL, which relies on the act of distribution to trigger the free
software reciprocity clause, the AGPLv3 includes the following term that was
articulated specifically for situations in which software is used on a network
but is not technically distributed. This clause states that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If you modify
the program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
interaction) an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version
by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no
charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
software.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This license term applies the distribution-based reciprocity
clause to cloud-based software offerings in which users run programs from remote
servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xc9feb0"></a>
AGPL in the Private Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
The AGPL was drafted as a solution to the problem
that the public cloud created.
Its preamble states that whereas the GPL &ldquo;permits making a modified version
and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source
code to the public...the AGPL is designed specifically to ensure that, in such
cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.&rdquo; But
what happens if an organization uses AGPL code internally? The remote network
interaction clause states that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If you modify the program, your modified
version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a
computer network an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your
version...through some standard customary means of facilitating copying of
software.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It appears that the same principle applies in both the public and
private cloud contexts&mdash;any users have the right to access the modified
code and to create their own versions. In the private cloud scenario, these
freedoms would extend to any employees, contractors and other parties using the
server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xca0170"></a>
Consequences of Non-Compliance with Open-Source License Obligations</h2></div></div><p>
The failure to comply with open-source license obligations can lead to severe
consequences, including being forced to come into compliance by releasing the
modified code and paying damages. Non-compliant organizations are exposed to
risk as courts in various jurisdictions including the United States, Germany and
France have consistently ruled that open-source licenses are enforceable,
leading to a proliferation of open-source litigation and settlements.
</p><p>
One of the earlier infringement suits that solidified the enforceability of open-source software resulted from the acquisition of Linksys by Cisco in 2003.
Shortly after the acquisition, Cisco was sued for infringement relating to the
use of GPL-covered code in its router firmware. It turned out that the
infringing chipset was provided to Linksys by Broadcom, which in turn outsourced
the development to a third party. As a part of the settlement that was reached
between the parties, Cisco was forced to make the infringing code available on
its Web site, appoint an open-source compliance officer and make a monetary
contribution to the Free Software Foundation. 
</p><p>
BusyBox also launched a string of successful infringement suits against
companies that incorporated its code and leveraged the resulting assets in
violation of the GPL. The first of these involved the use of BusyBox code in
embedded systems provided by Monsoon Multimedia, Inc. BusyBox alleged that
Monsoon utilized BusyBox code without making its modified code available to
downstream users pursuant to the GPL. The parties settled for an undisclosed
amount, and Monsoon agreed to publish its code and appoint an open-source
compliance officer. A similar settlement was reached between BusyBox and
Verizon Communications. More recently, BusyBox filed a suit against 14
electronics suppliers, including Samsung and Best Buy, alleging that the
defendants distributed devices containing BusyBox code without making their
modified code available to users. While some of these defendants opted to
settle, in the case of Westinghouse, a District Court in New York found in favor
of the plaintiff. In that case, the Court determined that Westinghouse
willfully infringed BusyBox's copyright in the code, and consequently the
damages were tripled.
</p><p>
The proliferation of open-source infringement suits and resulting settlements
have solidified the enforceability of open-source software. Because of the
immense financial and reputational damage that is associated with intellectual
property infringement suits, it is crucial for organizations to ensure
compliance with open-source license obligations. Although the cloud environment
poses new uncertainties for organizations relying on open-source software, there
are various tools that can be engaged to minimize the risk of non-compliance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba7580.0xca0380"></a>
How to Transition Your Organization into the Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Given the new obligations imposed by the AGPLv3, it is critical for cloud-based
SaaS providers to take inventory of the open-source code embedded in their
product offerings and to ensure that their intellectual property policies are
in line with the obligations imposed by the various open-source licenses
covering the code being used. A variety of tools are available that can
assist SaaS enterprises to ensure open-source compliance in the
cloud. For
example, enterprises can scan their software with tools that are specifically
designed to detect open-source code and provide a list of the license
obligations that accompany each component. In addition, a structured Open Source
Software Adoption Process (OSSAP) can be used to define acceptable intellectual
property license policies for the organization, audit the current software
portfolio and incoming code, and ensure compliance through all of the software
development and procurement stages. 
</p><p>
Open-source license management solutions now are accessible to companies in the
cloud. Because these solutions are hosted in the cloud environment, they
eliminate the need for enterprises to install or update code-scanning software.
Instead, companies can sign up with a service provider and are given access to
software that scans their code, identifies open source and provides a breakdown
of the associated license obligations. Such open-source license management
services are invaluable to SaaS enterprises, particularly given the
uncertainties associated with open source in the cloud. In addition to ensuring
that organizations understand and are able to meet their open-source license
obligations, these management solutions position enterprises to respond
efficiently and effectively to any instances of non-compliance that are
detected. For example, by understanding which components of the software are
used in a non-compliant fashion, SaaS enterprises are positioned to replace the
infringing code with code that offers similar functionality or to adapt their
policies to ensure adherence to obligations.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The emerging cloud-based SaaS model offers immense opportunities but also raises
new risks for organizations in relation to intellectual property infringement.
Various open-source license management solutions are available to assist
enterprises in making a safe transition into the cloud. For enterprises
planning on navigating the cloud environment&mdash;and for those that have
already made the migration&mdash;it is important to take an inventory of the
code incorporated in the software being offered and to determine if open-source
licensing obligations are being met. Keep in mind that the intellectual
property policies that were developed for the traditional software distribution
model will need to be assessed and updated to meet the distinct obligations
associated with the cloud environment.
