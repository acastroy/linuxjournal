Inkscape's vector graphics open a whole new world for creating art.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfc240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open W3C standard for describing
two-dimensional graphics in a different way than traditional computer
images, which are all bitmaps of some kind. A bitmap or raster graphic
is, ignoring compression and other optimization techniques, simply one
long list of all the pixels constituting an image, each one described
in as much detail as possible&mdash;exact color, transparency and so on.
</p><p>
Instead, a vector graphics file contains a series of pseudo-mathematical
instructions&mdash;such as draw a straight line from this to that
coordinate, create a rectangle of this size, rotate it 47 degrees
clockwise or fill it with red. The grandfather of vectorial formats
is PostScript.
</p><p>
The first and main benefit of this alternative method is being completely
separate from the capabilities of the physical display, be it a computer
monitor or a piece of paper. More exactly, although it is still (obviously)
impossible to see an ultra-crisp image on a low-resolution monitor or
printer, a vector graphic has no intrinsic resolution nor limits to
it. Vector graphics can be zoomed, shrunk or rotated as much as you
wish or as many times as you wish without any degradation, even when
printed. For an example, take a look at Figure 1, which shows 
two zoomed versions of the same drawing side by side, a raster drawing and a vector
drawing. The vector one, on the left, is much crisper than the other,
isn't it?
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9704f1.large.jpg"><img src="9704f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A clean vector image (left) compared to a raster image (right) pixilated
when expanded.
</p></div></div><p>
Another big plus of vector image files is that, because they are sequences
of instructions, the size of the image does not affect that of the file,
saving both disk space and download time on slow connections.
</p><p>
Last but not least, creating or processing &ldquo;a series of
commands&rdquo; is
a task that can be delegated to a computer
program easily and efficiently. SVG files can be mass-generated or modified in almost any way
without human intervention. The SVG 1.1 specification also describes 16
filter primitives that make it possible to obtain very complex objects
as well as highly realistic effects.
</p><p>
The main reason the world hasn't gone all vectorial yet is that
bitmaps remain much better at reproducing the subtle differences in
color and contrast that are present in photographs. Vector graphics,
however beautiful, are &ldquo;synthesized&rdquo;, and it often shows. In spite of
this, they remain extremely useful and are becoming more and more common
among GNU/Linux desktops.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfc8c8"></a>
Go Vectorial with Inkscape!</h2></div></div><p>
The most basic GUI-based vector graphics tools for Linux is Figurine,
which uses the same file format as the venerable Xfig, and Dia. A
much more promising application is Karbon 14, the vector graphic
component of KOffice. These days, however, the easiest way to get
started with vector graphics on Linux is Inkscape, because of its larger
on-line documentation (see Resources) and a wider, more active user
and developer community. So, let's see how to start producing vector
graphics with Inkscape.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfc9d0"></a>
The Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The Inkscape main window, shown in Figure 2, is pretty crowded. Right
below the main menu is a row of shortcuts to the most commonly used
commands, followed by a drawing-tool-dependant control bar. If you need to
cooperate with other users, sharing not only text but graphic information,
fire up the Pedro Xmpp client available (if your distribution included
it and all its dependencies) under the Whiteboard menu. Two handy
buttons with a wrench icon on the top-right corner give fast access to
global Inkscape preferences and to those of the current document.
The drawing tools are mapped to buttons on the right side&mdash;that's where
you go to create rectangles, spirals, polygons, circles, stars and lines
of any possible shape. All these objects have separate panes and control
bars where you can set anything from the number of turns in a spiral to
the points in a star. Finally, a bottom bar displays a color palette
and some status information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfcad8"></a>
Starting a New Project</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing to do after you click on File&rarr;New is decide the
geometric format of your drawing. There are several choices&mdash;from
several DVD covers to desktop wallpapers&mdash;at all the standard computer
and HDTV resolutions plus desktop icons, business cards and more.
</p><p>
To add objects to a drawing, you either can use the shape-related tools
on the left or draw from scratch with the pencil, pen and calligraphy
tools. Tools in the second group all draw paths defined by nodes. Existing
paths can be modified with the node tool, which is the button right
below the one with the arrow. After activating that tool, nodes are
shown as small diamonds and can be deleted or moved around. To select
all and only the nodes you want as quickly as possible, use the mouse
wheel. Scrolling it up selects nodes starting with those nearest to the
cursor; scrolling down deselects them. You also can smooth whole paths
(Path&rarr;Simplify) as well as join or break them.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9704f2.large.jpg"><img src="9704f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Tremor Values Applied to a Clean Vector Image of the Number Three
</p></div></div><p>
The tool for writing or anything else that must be drawn by hand with
a mouse or a graphic tablet is the calligraphy pen, which is associated
with the nib icon. There are several options for changing the appearance of
the pen strokes and their general behavior in order to achieve a more
realistic or personal look. Figure 2 shows the number three drawn with tremor
values of 0 (on the left) and 1.00 (on the right).
</p><p>
Once you have created or imported an object, you can modify its appearance
in many ways, thanks to the Inkscape filters, which can do things as
different as fractalization, saturation adjustment and
Gaussian blur. The latter is used to adjust a blur setting for an object.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfcef8"></a>
Object Unions</h2></div></div><p>
Paths and objects can be combined very quickly with boolean operations,
such as intersection, union, difference, exclusion and others. Simply select
the objects to combine and choose the desired operation from the Path
menu. Figures 3 and 4 show what you get when you intersect an oval
and a star.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9704f3.large.jpg"><img src="9704f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. The Same Intersection with a Different Boolean Operation
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfd370"></a>
Gradients</h2></div></div><p>
Solid colors can be dull, don't you agree? The fact that vector
drawings are generated through computer instructions doesn't mean that
their components must all be in solid colors. To create smooth color
transitions (that is, gradients) from one side of an object to another,
select it and open the Fill and Stroke dialog from the Object menu.
That window allows you to apply several gradient types and place the
corresponding stops&mdash;the exact start and end points between
which the color transition must take place. Gradients can be applied
to any object, including text.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfd478"></a>
Clone Everything</h2></div></div><p>
Inkscape has buttons or menu entries to copy, paste and duplicate objects.
Sometimes, however, what you want is a clone. Inkscape clones are special
copies of an object that can be moved around, scaled or rotated at
will but remain linked to it. By this we mean that any change to the
original is applied to all its clones automatically. If you press
Shift-Alt-D, a clone is detached from its ancestor and becomes a
fully independent object. Clones can be tiled (Edit&rarr;Tile) to create
patterns with many kinds of symmetrical or pseudo-random layouts. Reflection,
rotation, radial placement and row and column shifting are only a few of
the available choices, as shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9704f5.large.jpg"><img src="9704f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfd738"></a>
The History Tool</h2></div></div><p>
One great thing in Inkscape is its Undo History. Not only can you undo
all the changes you have made to a file, but they also are displayed in a
nested mode, as shown in Figure 6, which makes it much quicker to go back
right
to the point you wanted.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9704f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Comprehensive undo lets you get back to the exact operation
you have in mind.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfd9f8"></a>
Import and Export Capabilities</h2></div></div><p>
Inkscape can convert drawings or parts of drawings to PNG bitmaps. Select
File&rarr;Export as Bitmap, and remember to choose the right resolution; the
default is 90dpi. Besides its native SVG file format, Inkscape 
also can save your masterpieces in several special formats, including PovRay,
LaTeX, encapsulated PostScript, Adobe Illustrator 8, AutoCAD Dxf and
OpenDocument drawings.
</p><p>
On the opposite side&mdash;importing already-existing graphics&mdash;a
really neat feature of Inkscape is the capability to generate drawings
from LaTeX formulas. Most people, however, will find it much more useful to
&ldquo;trace&rdquo; JPEG, PNG or GIF images&mdash;that is, to convert them to vectorial
format. Some advanced Inkscape users even trace the bitmaps that
they generated from original vector drawings. The reason for doing this is that the
unavoidable degradation may be exactly what is missing to make your work
look more realistic.
</p><p>
Normally, if the starting bitmap is simple, the traced version is pretty
good. Tracing something as complex as a photograph is theoretically
possible, but in practice, the process is often so complex that it greatly
slows down Inkscape or simply halts it, depending on the computer. This said, there
are many different ways to trace bitmaps with Inkscape. To try them,
import a bitmap, select it and then click on Path&rarr;Trace Bitmap. In the
tracing pane, you'll then be able to generate one or more vectorial paths,
starting, for example, from the colors or the levels of brightness of
the original image.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdfdc08"></a>
Working with Text and Fonts</h2></div></div><p>
The big button with the capital A lets you create text objects. So far,
this is nothing special. What is great though is the possibility to make
text follow any line (Figure 7). Select both the text and the line while pressing
the Shift key, then select Text&rarr;Put on Path in the top menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9704f7.large.jpg"><img src="9704f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Make the text contour conform to an existing line.
</p></div></div><p>
As far as fonts are concerned, Inkscape can use any font available on
your computer. Therefore, if you aren't careful, your SVG file will not
be portable. The real solution would be to use only fonts that are
available on all platforms for all the files you need to distribute. When
this isn't possible, such as when the text is a company slogan that can
be only in the corporate-approved font, you can convert it to a vectorial
path (Path&rarr;Object to Path). Note that this increases the file size
and above all is a one-way process. The obvious workaround is always to 
keep a master copy with the actual text and distribute only the one with
the path.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdf47b0"></a>
Multilanguage Graphics</h2></div></div><p>
Sentences take different amounts of space in a graphic depending
on the language in which they are written. We already mentioned that
a big advantage of SVG is that it can be generated or processed
automatically. Combining these two facts, it is easy to see that you
can generate and maintain, with minimum effort, many versions of the
same banner, diagram or any other graphic that includes text, each in
a different language. The only thing to keep in mind is always to leave
enough space around that text to make sure that it fits no matter
what the language is. After that, follow the procedure described on the
&ldquo;Creating International Graphics&rdquo; Web page (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdf4910"></a>
It's Just XML after All</h2></div></div><p>
The SVG standard is another application of eXtensible Markup Language
(XML). If you view a file created with Inkscape at the command line or
in any text editor, instead of incomprehensible binary sequences, you'll
find something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;!-- Created with Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) --&gt;
&lt;svg


</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdf4a70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and lots of other very verbose, but plain ASCII text&mdash;terribly ugly but
still editable by hand in an emergency or processable by a script. What if
you have lots of logos and clip-art files, all with the names and official
color of your company, and then either the name or the color changes? If
all the files are in SVG, you simply can replace the right strings with awk,
sed, Perl or any other scripting language. To do the same thing on one
single file inside Inkscape, click on the &lt;&gt; bracket buttons or press
Shift-Ctrl-X to launch the Inkscape XML editor. Figure 8 shows how the
XML tree of the &ldquo;Linux is a Shining Star&rdquo; business card looks in this
editor. Path # 3456 is the oval/star shape combo from Figure 7. With this
editor, it is possible to change almost anything in the current file,
including SVG features for which there are still no graphical tools.
Another reason to use the editor is that every change you make in
it immediately applies to the actual graphic in the main Inkscape
window. Speaking of structured documents, selecting File&rarr;Document
Metadata in Inkscape opens a pane where you can set the Dublin core
entities or the license of the current file.

Never Forget the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
Although Inkscape obviously is intended primarily as a GUI application,
it can be used for doing SVG processing on the command line as well. Here
are some examples straight from the man page:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >inkscape filename.svg -p '| lpr'</tt> &mdash; Print an
SVG file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >inkscape filename.svg --export-png=filename.png</tt>
&mdash; Export an SVG file into PNG.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >inkscape filename.svg --export-eps=filename.eps
--export-text-to-path</tt> &mdash; Convert an SVG document to EPS,
converting all texts to paths.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >inkscape --query-id=zoom_in -X
/usr/share/inkscape/icons/icons.svg</tt> &mdash; Find the x
position of the zoom-in icon in the default icon file on a Linux system.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >inkscape filename.svg --query-width --query-id
text1555</tt> &mdash; Query the width of the object with
id=``text1555''.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd04580.0xdf5410"></a>
What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
The screenshots and the text of this article refer to Inkscape 0.45
on SUSE 10.1. The official Inkscape road map tells us that the most
interesting things in the near future should be PDF import/export and
Visio support in version 0.47, followed by the authoring of simple animations
in Inkscape 0.48. Version 0.50 should include SVG Mobile support. The
plan also includes switching parts of the display engine to Cairo, up to
the point where Inkscape can use the hardware-accelerated back end of
that library. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons to try Inkscape
today and keep an eye on it in the coming months.
