Solid Information Technology and Proven Scaling's DorsalSource</h2></div></div><p>
The blogs remain alive with the sound of grumbling after MySQL stopped
providing binaries of the community edition for some versions of
its popular database. To appease the database faithful, the firms
Solid Information Technology and Proven Scaling teamed up to create
DorsalSource.org, a repository for updated binaries of MySQL and
related products, such as solidDB for MySQL. Platforms covered include
Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The site will be maintained and run
by the community.

CD Recycling Center of America</h2></div></div><p>
The CD Recycling Center of America is not a new product per se but
rather a means to transform our old products&mdash;compact discs&mdash;into
new ones. The Center recycles &ldquo;all components of compact-disc packaging,
CDs and DVDs alike, including the disc, the case and the paper
booklet&rdquo;.
By recycling, you'll save energy and landfill space and reduce pollution,
and your CDs will become raw materials for a new generation of products.
Center founder Bruce Bennett says, &ldquo;If a product requires manufacturing
into a man-made item that basically will not naturally recycle itself,
then man has the duty to find, collect, recycle and reuse as much of that
product as new products in any way he can. Compact discs are one of these
man-made products.&rdquo; We couldn't have said it more eloquently ourselves.

Tumbling Dice's Fedora coLinux</h2></div></div><p>
If the virtualization scene makes you giddy, have a good cackle over
Tumbling Dice's new Fedora coLinux, a customized coLinux distribution
that runs Fedora Core virtually under Microsoft Windows. Tumbling Dice
claims easier installation than the standard coLinux, a complete manual,
ease of use and full Fedora Core functionality. Target customers for
the product include &ldquo;technically competent 'hobbyists'&rdquo;, who don't want
the overhead of a dual-boot solution, and companies and institutions
with spare computing resources to deploy for large-scale applications
(such as databases, simulations and so forth). The software/manual combo are
available for download from the firm's Web site. Also see the coLinux
link below for more info on the project.

Addison-Wesley's Professional Ruby Series</h2></div></div><p>
At about a one-a-month clip, and under the umbrella of its media-agnostic
Professional Ruby Series, Addison-Wesley is cranking out interesting new
resources for Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers. One of the series' new
products is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails Routing</em></span>, a Digital Short Cut (PDF download) from author
David Black on taking full advantage of the Rails routing system. Another
new product is the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>RailsSpace: Building a Social Networking Website
with Ruby on Rails</em></span>, from Michael Hartl and Aurelius Prochazka. RailsSpace
&ldquo;helps developers learn to build large-scale, industrial-strength projects
in Ruby on Rails by developing a real-world application: a social
networking Web site a la MySpace, Facebook, or Friendster&rdquo;. Finally,
RailsSpace also features a companion video-training product, dubbed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>RailsSpace livelessons</em></span>, due out in July 2007.

Wolfram Research's Mathematica</h2></div></div><p>
Do all of us a favor by holding a cup under your drool-leaking mouth
as you read on, because Wolfram Research has released Version 6 of its
flagship Mathematica application. Mathematica 6, a powerful general
computation environment for calculations, large-scale computations,
complex programming and visualizing and modeling data, is the &ldquo;most
important advance in its 20-year history&rdquo;, says Wolfram, as well
as &ldquo;a
whole new way of interacting with the world of data&rdquo;. Key new advances
include dynamic interface creation; adaptive visualization; symbolic
interface construction; improved automation of external data handling;
final-quality presentation throughout the working process; built-in
utilization of computable data sources; and the unification of graphics,
text and controls. Mathematica 6 has 32- and 64-bit editions for Linux
(SUSE, Red Hat, Fedora), UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X.

FiveRuns' RM-Manage and RM-Install</h2></div></div><p>
The firm FiveRuns, maker of a popular systems management application,
is busting out into new territory with its new Enterprise Management
Suite for Rails, a series of applications for managing the full Rails
application life cycle. The suite's first two offerings are RM-Manage
and RM-Install, with more on the way. FiveRuns calls RM-Manage &ldquo;the
only Rails application management tool in the market today&rdquo;, helping to
&ldquo;monitor and manage the production performance of the Rails
application&rdquo;.
Meanwhile, RM-Install is a &ldquo;tested, multiplatform enterprise-ready Rails
stack&rdquo; that ensures that all of the parts (for example Ruby,
Rails, MySQL, Apache and
LightTPD) will work together during Rails development. FiveRuns points
out that its Rails expertise comes from using it to build its original
flagship application. RM-Install is a free download; RM-Manage is
available on a subscription basis.

OrangeHRM On-Demand</h2></div></div><p>
The range of corporate apps available to Linux users continues to mature
with the recently released OrangeHRM On-Demand 2.1, a hosted version
of OpenHRM's open-source human resources management solution for small
and mid-size enterprises. OrangeHRM claims to be reaching parity with
proprietary HRM solutions while offering &ldquo;key pricing and development
cycle advantages&rdquo; due to open source. As a SaaS solution, On-Demand
requires no in-house hardware or software and is subscription-priced
based on duration and number of users. OrangeHRM's technology features
a rich, Ajax-based interface, a lightweight LAMP architecture and open
data standards based on HR-XML. Feature improvements in version 2.1
include easier employee-leave administration, improved employee search,
user-defined employee IDs and enhanced reporting. The application is
available as a free download from OrangeHRM's Web site and uses the GNU
GPL open-source license.
