Ajax Overdose</h4><p>
First let me say that I love your magazine. I look forward to each issue
and I enjoy almost every article...yes, even you Marcel.
</p><p>
My gripe is that your magazine focuses far too much on Ajax. Don't get me
wrong. I love Ajax. I use it in my JSPs all the time. But come on! It's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a Linux technology, but yet it gets coverage in
almost every issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
since at least October 2006.
</p><p>
Let's take a look back:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
October 2006: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;JavaScript, Forms and Ajax&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
November 2006: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;Beginning Ajax&rdquo;;
Feature&mdash;&ldquo;Caller ID with Asterisk and Ajax&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
December 2006: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;Ajax Application Design&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
January 2007: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;Prototype&rdquo; (Ajax);
Indepth&mdash;&ldquo;Ajax Timelines and the Semantic Web&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
February 2007: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;Scriptaculous&rdquo; (Ajax).
</p></li><li><p>
March 2007: A nice break from Ajax.
</p></li><li><p>
April 2007: At the Forge&mdash;&ldquo;Dojo Events and Ajax&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
May 2007: Ajax everywhere!
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Is Ajax really a subject that needs to be covered in every issue? This is
still <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, not <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ajax
Journal</em></span>, right? Aren't there other non-Web
development topics that can be covered in At the Forge?

We'll do our best to cover different ground. However, Ajax is an extremely
popular approach to providing users with a rich-client experience. Its
platform-neutrality and the broad set of Linux tools available make it an
excellent Linux topic.&mdash;Ed.

Ajax Appreciated</h4><p>
I just wanted to tell you your coverage of Ajax, Ruby and programming
languages, hot topics in the industry, is just awesome. I am glad I
bought a subscription from you guys. I am a Linux hobbist/Web
developer/graduating senior from ASU Polytechnic and just wanted to
let you know you are doing an awesome job.

Don't Just Beat Me, Teach Me</h4><p>
I've read your magazine off and on for years, and I even had a
subscription a few years back&mdash;excellent magazine.
</p><p>
I'm writing because you have an old story from 1998, written by Jason
Kroll. I read it a few times. I tried to contact Jason, but his e-mail
has changed from the one you listed (that's no surprise, the article is
nine
years old).
</p><p>
Anyway, I would love to discover a good chess-playing program for Linux
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>teaches</em></span> me how to improve, besides beating me at chess. All the games
mentioned in the article are good. I have tried a few&mdash;gnuchess, crafty,
etc. They will play a very strong game, and you can save games for
study. But, this doesn't <span   class="emphasis"><em>teach</em></span> me the way a program like ChessMaster can teach
people. ChessMaster runs only on Windows, and I don't want to struggle
with Wine as a workaround. This is 2007, I am using the latest
kernel on Kubuntu, and I'm really happy with my Linux experience. I would
appreciate it if you or Jason could try to help me locate a ChessMaster equivalent
for Linux.

Great idea. We'll put out a call for such an article and see if we can
turn up an author who wants to tackle it.&mdash;Ed.

Ajax Examples Are Wrong</h4><p>
I have tried a number of examples from the May 2007 issue's articles and have discovered
that all of the examples are flowed with the same bug. The problem can
be narrowed down to these two lines in all examples.
</p><p>
From the magazine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http.open("GET", url + escape(zipValue), true);
http.onreadystatechange = handleHttpResponse;
</pre>
</p><p>
The right way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http.onreadystatechange = handleHttpResponse;
http.open("GET", url + escape(zipValue), true);
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is if you make the call to open before a call-back
function is defined, the response will end up in the great big void.
After calling open, the script's control stops and control will first be
gained again when open calls the call-back function with the response.
</p><p>
Apart from this, though a fundamental change, all scripts work as
expected.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

PS. A little annoyance: I think it would be a good idea if the writers
actually listed HTML that is able to validate:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W#C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;!-- Doctype declaration are missing in some examples --&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;AJAX Contactbook&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;!-- Declaration of charset is missing in all examples --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
charset=utf-8"/&gt;

&lt;!-- mixed notation for attributes in almost all examples: foo=2
bar="3" --&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Other than that, I think <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is a great magazine.


<br><br>&mdash;<br>

</p><p>
All of the examples I tried, myself, worked. But I'll take your word for
it that they present problems in other environments. Thanks for the tips
and suggestion.&mdash;Ed.

Network Computing Still Expensive</h4><p>
I am sending you this e-mail at great expense. No, not Great Expense,
Arizona, great expense over dial-up. At the moment, I am in semi-rural Germany
where +ADSL/Broadband has not yet reached. I suspect that the same goes for rural
France, Holland, Spain and many other European countries. It certainly
applies to England, where because of distance from the exchange coupled
with poor quality (for data) cabling broadband has not reached. Even at my
home location on the outskirts of a 300,000 population conurbation, the best
speed on a good day is 1Mb.
</p><p>
So, whilst I think you are 100% right regarding network computing [see the
May 2007 /var/opinion], until
good reliable Internet access at realistic speeds becomes available, it is
some way off.

Now You See Them</h4><p>
In the Letters section [April 2007], Chris Trayner mentioned in his
response to you that under KDE he could no longer use certain features and
concluded that these features had been removed from KDE. This conclusion is,
fortunately, incorrect&mdash;the features he was looking for are still
available.
</p><p>
I just checked in the KDE Control Centre (under recent Mandriva and
Knoppix releases) and found the following options:
</p><p>
a) Alter Delete item on file context menu:
go to the Components (or KDE Components) menu item, then File Manager,
then the Behaviour tab, and see the check boxes in the second part of this panel.
</p><p>
b) Changing window titlebar double-click behaviour:
go to the Desktop (or System) menu item, then Window Behaviour, then the
Actions (or Titlebar Actions) tab. There you will see a drop-down
box labeled Titlebar Double-click.
</p><p>
c) Moving maximised windows:
go to the Desktop (or System) menu item, then Window Behaviour, then the Moving
tab. There you will see a check box relating to this option.
</p><p>
d) Although not previously mentioned, one option I always use if the
initial setup allows it is icon activation using a single mouse click (such
as under
Knoppix):
go to the Peripherals menu item, then Mouse. The second part of this
panel contains the options relating to icon activation.
</p><p>
Please note that the alternative names for various configuration items is
because different distributions and release versions have used the
various names as shown.
</p><p>
Perhaps the distro that Chris uses has changed various of its KDE
feature defaults. Alternatively, it may have removed these features. If so,
maybe Chris should consider changing distros.

Correction to Piece about KRUU-FM</h4><p>
I'm one of the members of community radio KRUU-LP, which you wrote
about in your May 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> [see Doc
Searls' piece in the
UpFront section]. I'd like to point out that
we're actually Kruufm.com, and not Kruufm.org. Kruufm.com, the radio
station, is not affiliated with Kruufm.org in any way at present.
