One of the applications that we Linuxers have long longed to have natively
on our beloved platform is Adobe Photoshop. Although nearly all of us have
turned to the trusty GIMP for our image manipulation needs, The GIMP's
limitations, such as lack of support for the CMYK color model, keep it
from fully replacing Photoshop. Luckily in our community, if there's a
hole in the application portfolio, there is a scrappy, innovative dot-org or developer striving to fill it. A prime case in point is Pavel
Kanzelsberger, the Slovakia-based developer of Pixel, an up-and-coming
and very multiplatform image manipulation program. If Kanzelsberger's
ambitions are realized, his handiwork may one day even out-Photoshop
Photoshop. We recently caught up with Pavel to find out more about Pixel.

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ: Thank you for agreeing to speak with us,
Pavel. First of all, how does Pixel compare to Photoshop? And, do
you aim for compatibility in file formats and the same or a similar
feature set?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Well, frankly, Pixel tries to be comparable with Photoshop in terms of
features. But, on the other hand, it tries to be smaller and have lower
hardware requirements. I wouldn't compare it to Photoshop yet, because
Pixel is still in beta. My goal is to catch up with the industry-standard
Photoshop and then bring in more innovative and better features. Pixel will
support import and export to Photoshop file formats, but it is utilizing
its own file format, because there already are some unique features not
present in Photoshop.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What features of Pixel are you most proud of?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Those features unique to Pixel, such as multiple-color managed
clipboards and color management in general. The live effects feature was
quite difficult to do as well, and I think that it is already better
than Photoshop. In Photoshop, you can use an effect only once, and you
cannot control the effect's order.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are your customers asking for regarding changes or
improvements?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I'm getting a lot of requests and ideas from users. I think they
like to influence development in a way that is not possible for bigger
commercial projects.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Are you finding a large number of Linux users who say they cannot
live without Photoshop but then find Pixel to be a good
alternative?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Yes, most Linux customers are using Pixel for this reason. Many
users won't migrate from Windows to Linux because they're missing
applications like Photoshop. There also are users who like a familiar
interface. As far I know, Pixel is the only application supporting CMYK
and proper color management on Linux.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you compare Pixel and The GIMP for us?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Sure. Compared to Pixel, GIMP is missing a lot of important
features, such as
CMYK support, color management, layer adjustments, layer effects and so on.
Also, a lot of people complain about GIMP's user interface. Such
an approach is very common on Mac OS X (have a look at Photoshop), but
people find it strange on Linux and Windows. Otherwise, it is a nice open-source effort and will do just fine for basic editing.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: If I am a graphic designer, will I have any production difficulties
with prepress, printing companies and so forth if I use Pixel vs. more mainstream
graphics tools?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I wouldn't recommend it right now, as it's in a beta state, but when
it's finished I think it will be perfectly usable in such environments.
All tools needed for prepress and printing will be ready in the final
release.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: You seem to have nearly every OS imaginable covered, including Linux,
FreeBSD, Windows, BeOS, OS/2 and many others. How and why did Pixel
become so multiplatform?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Pixel started as a DOS application in 1997, and then it was ported to
Windows because everybody already was using Windows by that time. Pixel's
&ldquo;multiplatformness&rdquo; started with a request from Be Inc., the former
BeOS developer. They donated all the tools and help for porting
Pixel to BeOS. After that, I discovered Linux and decided to rewrite
Pixel from scratch and make it less platform-dependent, so it could be
ported to new operating systems or architectures easily. All of the
other exotic platforms came mostly by community requests and OS fans.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How many customers do you have, and what platforms are the most
popular?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Right now, without any marketing and with an unfinished product,
you can count them in the hundreds. I hope it gets better when Pixel
is finished. The most popular platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OS
X&mdash;in that order. Windows is doing 50% of all downloads; Mac OS X and
Linux together make around 40%.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: I see that you charge $38 US for Pixel. Are you finding resistance
among Linux and FreeBSD people to pay for their software?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Yes, quite often even with requests to open-source Pixel. But, I'm
trying to explain to them the licensing scheme. I'm not charging money
for the Linux version of Pixel, but I'm charging for Pixel itself. It
doesn't matter which operating system you are using&mdash;the license allows
you to use any or all of them.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Can you tell us a little bit about the development process? For
example, how much work do you do yourself vs. others on your development
team, if you have one?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: The Pixel development team consists of one person, and
that is me. So everything is done by me, including development, Web site
management, bug tracking, support and so on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: We would like to know more about you too, Pavel. Is the Pixel
project a full-time job for you, or do you have another day job so 
you can pay your bills?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I've had full-time jobs in the past, but since early 2006, Pixel is the
only job I've got. It is a very important project for me, so I decided
to quit my job and focus on Pixel alone. When I saw Pixel was selling
and earning enough money monthly, I decided to quit my job and live off
Pixel. For now it works, and I hope it gets better in the future, but
you know this place on earth where I am [Slovakia] is quite cheap to live.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Do you have sponsors who help pay the bills?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I don't have a sponsorship of any kind, but I'm getting offers from
time to time.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What other things have you done in your career?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I worked in different environments, mostly with Linux servers, SQL
databases and Web-based applications. I made a few corporate information
systems and even led a team of multimedia developers in Asia.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Where did you work in Asia?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: I worked in Seoul, Korea, for about a year in 2005. However, the
photo I sent you for this interview is from Tokyo, Japan, where I spent
only week or so. I was using Linux there, and because of that, they treated
me like I was an exotic dude. They use Windows so much.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What inspired you to create Pixel?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: When I learned programming, I had a really prehistoric computer called
IBM PC XT with a CPU at 4.77MHz and a CGA graphics card. My plan was to
make some games, but as you need graphics for games, I started by making
an image editor. The first version I made was called GFX Studio, which
was running in DOS in 320x200 resolution and four colors! It already had
a windowed interface and that gradually evolved into what you see today.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What tools do you use to develop Pixel?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: Most of the time I'm developing on Gentoo Linux with the GNOME
desktop. I don't like over-complicated IDEs, so I'm using a simple text
editor with syntax highlighting and a set of command-line tools to
compile and debug Pixel. A few of them are fpc compiler, gcc, binutils,
gdb and valgrind.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: I understand that you live in Slovakia. What can you tell us
about the Linux-related activity in your country compared to the rest
of Europe? Are there other interesting projects or developments there
that are worth mentioning?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: From what I've seen on the Internet, Linux is becoming very popular
here, mostly in schools. There are many communities trying to help
Linux newcomers, translating various Linux programs and so on. I know
some very clever software developers in my country, but they're mostly
involved in the gaming industry and in other commercial 3-D projects.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What future features should we look for in Pixel?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: In the near future, I'm planning to improve PSD import and to add
full support for Photoshop plugins. I also might push for Wine support
for the Linux version.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are your interests besides taking care of Pixel?</b></span>
</p><p>
PK: My family and my one-year-old son are the top priority right now.
Otherwise, I like sports cars and driving. When I find some extra time,
I like to play tennis or visit our beautiful natural areas.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Thank you, Pavel, and good luck to you with Pixel!</b></span>
