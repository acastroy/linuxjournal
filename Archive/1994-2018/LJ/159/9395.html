Having covered some advanced features in Part I, it's time to include some
basics.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d23a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The tutorial in last month's issue covered the basics of installing Python, running
it and using it. Then, we moved on to building a basic blog in Python. The
blog was extremely simple&mdash;only a Python list. We focused on the posts
and built a Post class:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Post(object):
    def __init__(self, title, body):
        self.set_title(title)
        self.set_body(body)

    def set_title(self, title):
        self._title = title

    def get_title(self):
         return self._title

    def set_body(self, body):
        self._body = body

    def get_body(self):
         return self._body

    def __repr__(self):
        return "Blog Post: %s" % self.get_title()
</pre>
</p><p>
In this follow-up article, let's focus on the blog itself and go further.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d2660"></a>
The Blog</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have the Post class, we can make the Blog class. An initial
implementation may look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Blog(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._posts = []

    def add_post(self, post):
        self._posts.append(post)

    def get_posts(self):
        return self._posts
</pre>
</p><p>
We are using a list to maintain the posts, but the interface is totally
abstract behind a set of methods in the Blog class. This has a huge
advantage: tomorrow we could replace that simple list with an SQL back
end,
and the code that uses Blog will need few, if any, changes.
</p><p>
Notice that there's no way to
delete a post. We could tamper with _posts directly, but as long as we do
what the class was meant to do, we can't delete a post. That may be good
or bad, but the important thing is that by defining a set of methods, we
exposed the design of how the class should be used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d28c8"></a>
To Publish or Not to Publish</h2></div></div><p>

The method get_posts returns all the posts. When we are writing a new
post, we don't want the whole world to be able to read it until it
is finished. The posts need a new member that tell whether it is
published. In Post's initalizator, __init__,
we add the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
self._published = False
</pre>
</p><p>
That makes every new post private by default. To 
switch states, we add the methods:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def publish(self):
    self._published = True

def hide(self):
    self._published = False

def is_public(self):
    return self._published
</pre>
</p><p>
In these methods, I introduced a new kind of variable&mdash;the boolean. Booleans
are simple; they can be true or false. Let's play with that a bit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool = blog.Post("Cool", "Python is cool")
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.is_public()
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.publish()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.is_public()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.hide()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cool.is_public()
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
If, when you run is_public, you get:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "blog.py", line 25, in is_public
    return self._published
AttributeError: 'Post' object has no attribute 
'_published'

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d2ce8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's because _published was not created,
it can't be used, and is_public wants to use it. Understanding
errors in your tools is important if you want to be a successful
programmer.
</p><p>
In this short set of messages, the last line is the error itself. There
are various types of errors, and this one is an AttributeError. A lot of
important information is given in the traceback. A traceback is a list of
&ldquo;who called whom&rdquo;, providing an idea of what was being executed when
the error occurred.
</p><p>
The first line of the traceback doesn't give much information. It
probably relates to the line we typed at the REPL. The second line
tells that the error was in the file blog.py, on line 25, on the method
is_public. Now we have the line that raised the problem.
</p><p>
This traceback is simple. In a real application, you would have methods
that call methods that call methods and so on. In those cases, it is not
uncommon to see tracebacks of 25 lines or more. I've seen tracebacks of
more than 150 lines, but those were extreme cases in extreme conditions.
</p><p>
The next step is a modification to the Blog class to pick up
only published posts. So, we add a new method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def get_public_posts(self):
    published_posts = []
    for post in self._posts:
        if port.is_public():
            published_posts.append(post)
</pre>
</p><p>
Python tries to be as readable as possible, but that method introduces
too many new things, so it requires some careful explanations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d3058"></a>
Loops</h2></div></div><p>
One of the Python's looping constructs is for. It is designed
to iterate over lists, sets, maps and other iterable objects. In this
case, it takes all the items in self._posts and, one by one,
assigns them to the variable post. In the body of the for, which
is executed on each iteration, we can use the variable post.
</p><p>
The body of the for, as with other constructs that need a piece
of code, is delimited by nothing more than the indentation. Here's
an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; the_list = [1,2,3,"a","b"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in the_list:
...     print item
...
1
2
3
a
b
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Various tasks are solved with a loop. One such task is
doing something for each member of a collection, like we did in the
previous example. For those types of tasks, the for construct is excellent.
</p><p>
Another common practice is to perform an action a given number of
times&mdash;for example, printing &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; three
times. To do that we can use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while a &lt; 3:
...     print "Hello world"
...     a = a + 1
...
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Another loop construct is while, and it will continue to run its
body until the check&mdash;that is, the expression after while and before
the colon&mdash;becomes false.
</p><p>
We can rethink the previous loop as iterating over a list containing
the numbers 0&ndash;9. There's
a way to do it with a for construct:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a in range(0,3):
...     print "Hello world"
...
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
This is shorter and arguably more readable. What is while useful
for then? It is useful any time you don't really know when you are
going to stop the loop. Here are some examples:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Reading characters from a file until you encounter the End of File (EOF).
</p></li><li><p>
Reading commands from a user until the user enters the quit command.
</p></li><li><p>
Reading temperatures from a sensor until the temperature is too high.
</p></li><li><p>
Reading events from a user interface until the user presses the
X button at the top of the window to close the program.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There's a pattern forming here&mdash;doing something until something else
happens. That's what while is good for.
</p><p>
Some time ago, when we didn't have as many choices in programming
languages and we ended up using C most of the time, the while
construct tended to be much more useful than the for construct. But
today, with a powerful for construct, nice functions such as
range and the possibility of putting an iterator around anything,
for is being used much more than while.
</p><p>
Here's one last example for your enjoyment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for l in "Hello World":
...     print l + " ",
...
H  e  l  l  o     W  o  r  l  d
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x14d39a0"></a>
Conditionals</h2></div></div><p>
In the fourth line of some previous sample code, <tt  >if
post.is_public()</tt>, we have another new construct&mdash;an if. This
allows programs to make choices based on data. It needs a boolean
value and a piece of code. The code is run only if the boolean is True. If
you provide something that is not a boolean, Python does its best to
interpret it as a boolean. For example, the number 0 is interpreted
as False, but all the other numbers as True. Here are some 
examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; if True:
...     print "It is true!"
...
It is true!
&gt;&gt;&gt; if False:
...     print "Is it false?"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
We can perform many different types of comparisons on different
kinds of objects. Note that the equality operator is ==,
not = (that is, two equal signs):

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; if a == 10:
...     print "Ten!"
...
Ten!
</pre>
</p><p>
There are other comparisons, such as greater than (&gt;), less
than (&lt;) and different (!=). You can experiment with
comparisons directly on the REPL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 == 4
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 != 5
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 &gt;= 1
True
</pre>
</p><p>
It is common to run a piece of code if something is true and another
piece of code if it is false. For example, we could do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if a == 10:
    print "A is ten."
if a != 10:
    print "A is not ten."
</pre>
</p><p>
This has a big problem. If we change a to b in the first
case, we have to remember to change it in the second. And, the same should
be done for any other little changes we do. The solution is an extension to the
if construct:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if a == 10:
    print "A is ten."
else:
    print "A is not ten."
</pre>
</p><p>
The piece of code after the else will be executed if the
first piece wasn't executed.
</p><p>
Another common situation is having various conditionals for 
different cases. In that case, we use a string of ifs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if a == 10:
    print "A is ten."
elif a == 0:
    print "A is zero."
elif a != 30:
    print "A is not thirty."
else:
    print "Who cares about a ?"
</pre>
</p><p>
elif is the contraction of &ldquo;else if&rdquo;, and indeed, the previous
code could be written as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if a == 10:
    print "A is ten."
else:
    if a == 0:
        print "A is zero."
    else:
        if a != 30:
            print "A is not thirty."
        else:
            print "Who cares about a ?"
</pre>
</p><p>
But, that is ugly and prone to errors. If you have
10 or 15 different cases, you'll need a 29"-widescreen monitor
just to view it. (Not that I have anything against such a monitor. I'd
like to have one.)
</p><p>
If you come from other languages that have a switch or
select or case construct and are wondering where they
are in Python, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Python doesn't have
such constructs. There's a proposal to include them, but it hasn't been
implemented yet. Right now, the solution is to use a chain of
ifs, elifs and elses. After you use this a few 
times, it's not so bad.
</p><p>
Now that you know about else, here's an interesting tidbit:
for and while also can have elses. What do they
do? Run Python, and try it out until you discover for yourself. While
programming, you'll need to run a lot of code to find out how many undocumented,
obscure, almost black-magic, things work, so starting with something
simple will help you get some training.

Inheritance</h2></div></div><p>
The short introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Part I
of this article left out a big topic&mdash;inheritance. This feature is
what makes OOP really useful, and as OOP tries to mimic real life, I
explain inheritance here with real-life examples.
</p><p>
Think about a chair. A chair is made out of some kind of material, has two
armrests, a back, a color, a style and maybe even a warranty. Now, think
about a table. It is made out of some kind of material, might have some drawers, a
color, a style and maybe a warranty. They have a lot in common! If
we were to make the two classes, Chair and Table, a lot of code would be
repeated. In programming, when you write the same line of code twice,
you probably are doing something wrong&mdash;inheritance to the
rescue.
</p><p>
A chair is a piece of furniture. So is a table. Such similarities
can be in the Furniture class. Let's make the Furniture
class have a default material and the ability to set other materials:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Furniture(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._material = "wood"
    
    def set_material(self, material):
        self._material = material
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x18cc640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And now, a Chair class inheriting Furniture:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Chair(Furniture):
    def __init__(self):
        self._backrest_height = 30
    
    def set_backrest_height(self, height):
        self._backrest_height = height
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you know what goes inside parentheses in the class header: the name of
the class being inherited, which also is known as a super class or parent class. Let's
play a bit with this, so you can see what happens:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Chair()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.set_backrest_height(50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c._backrest_height
50
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.set_material("plastic")
&gt;&gt;&gt; c._material
'plastic'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the methods of Furniture also are on
Chair. I leave the definition of the Table class as
an exercise for the reader. But first, here's another interaction:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Chair()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d._backrest_height
30
&gt;&gt;&gt; d._material
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'Chair' object has no attribute '_material'
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>

I bet that is not what you expected. Let's take a closer look at what
happened. We created a Chair, the method Chair.__init__
was run setting _backrest_height. Oh! Nobody called
Furniture.__init__, which never set _material. There are
two solutions to that.
</p><p>
Setting _material in Chair.__init__ is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a solution. If we do that, the classes would be
coupled, meaning the implementation of one will depend on the
implementation of the other. If we change the name of _material
to _materials, suddenly Chair will stop working. If you
have hundreds of classes developed by hundreds of different people,
keeping track of those changes is difficult. Also, Furniture will
grow to have more members, so we have to remember to set all those members
to the same defaults in Chair.__init__. I'm getting
a headache just thinking about it.
</p><p>
One real solution is calling Furniture.__init__ and rewriting
Chair.__init__ this way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def __init__(self):
    Furniture.__init__(self)
    self._backrest_height = 30
</pre>
</p><p>
We had to pass self to __init__, because if we called it
with the class instead of the object, it wouldn't know in which object
to do its operations.
</p><p>
I personally don't like that solution, because it implies writing the name of the
class in two or more places. If you ever change the name, you'll have to
remember to run a search and replace. Another solution is
more cryptic than it should be, but it doesn't have the problem I just mentioned:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def __init__(self):
    super(Chair, self).__init__()
    self._backrest_height = 30
</pre>
</p><p>
In this solution, I call super, passing the current class and
the current object, and it allows me to make a call to the parent class
using the current object. Here we may have a problem if
we change the name of the class itself, but running a search and
replace on the file is a good idea when making that kind of change. You'd
want to change the documentation as well. The real problem with this
solution is hard to understand and to explain&mdash;it has to do with
multiple inheritance. For more information, read &ldquo;Python's Super
Considered Harmful&rdquo;. Personally, I've been using this second solution
without any problems.
</p><p>
You'll see that all classes I defined inherit from object. That
is the most basic class&mdash;the root (or top) class. It is a good idea to
make all your classes inherit from it unless they inherit from another
class. If you don't do that, your class will be an old-style class, and
some things won't work, such as super. It is important to
know this, because you may encounter old-style classes anywhere, and you
should be prepared.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x18ccd78"></a>
Python 2.5</h2></div></div><p>
During the process of writing this article, with much excitement and
fanfare, Python 2.5 was released. It is the most important release in
almost two years, and it comes with many promises.
</p><p>
It promises to be more reliable due to improvements in the testing
procedures used by the Python development team. It now has Buildbot,
a program that continuously builds and tests Python, and whenever there's
something wrong, it raises an alarm for all the world to see. The
shame of being the developer who made the error will make all the developers more
careful&mdash;at least, that's what happened to me when I had a Buildbot watching
my code.
</p><p>
For some, like this author who had a new release at the worst possible
time, the most important thing is that Python 2.5 is backward-compatible. All
that you've learned here will work. And, not only will it work, it is still
the way to do it.
</p><p>
The new release also promises to be faster and has many new advanced
features, including
new modules and packages. The future is bright for Python and
Python coders.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13da580.0x18ccf88"></a>
What Now?</h2></div></div><p>
This was nothing but a short introduction to Python; there's still much
to learn. A good place to start is the official Python Tutorial. You
also can read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dive Into Python</em></span>, a book that you can buy or read for free
on the Web. And, of course, a lot of other books and tutorials are
available. I
learned Python mainly from the Python Tutorial, which is very good.
</p><p>
Whenever you are creating a program in Python, never, and I repeat, never,
do anything without checking whether it has been done before. Python has a
lot of features and a lot of built-in libraries. And, if that isn't
enough,
there are hundreds, maybe thousands of third-party Python libraries. In
fact, the huge amount of code that's already written in Python is
one of the reasons to use it.
</p><p>
The first stop is Python's Documentation. There we have the previously
mentioned tutorial, the library reference and the language reference.
</p><p>
The language reference can be a bit hard to use and
understand. Programming languages tend to be difficult to understand and so
are their references, which often have exclusive jargon, such as lexical
analysis, tokens, identifiers, keywords or delimiters. This piece of
documentation can be particularly useful in showing how to use
language constructs, such as for, if, while
and more complex ones that I haven't mentioned, such as yield,
break or continue.
</p><p>
The library references let us know about all the classes, methods and
functions that Python already provides. It is so important and useful that
I always have it open when I am programming on Python. In the second
chapter, you can read about the built-in functions and classes. Getting
familiar with them is always useful. The rest of the documentation is
very specific, and each chapter deals with subjects ranging from runtime
internals to string, from the Python debugger to some generic operating
systems services. In that chapter, a very important module is documented:
os. I can't remember making a single program that didn't use that module.
</p><p>
Finding what you want in so much documentation can be a difficult
task. A trick that I find very useful is to use Google to search
in a specific site. That is achieved by adding
&ldquo;site:python.org&rdquo; or
&ldquo;site:docs.python.org&rdquo; to the search query. The first one is
more generic and sometimes leads to countless mailing-list posts that have nothing to
do with what you are looking for. In that situation, use the second
one. To give it a
try, search for &ldquo;print site:python.org&rdquo; or &ldquo;options
site:python.org&rdquo;.
</p><p>
What if all of your searches return nothing? Then, you need to do a 
broader search to find some third-party libraries or frameworks. If you want
to make a graphical user interface, I recommend both PyGTK and PyQt,
both are very good and include support for their respective desktops,
GNOME and KDE. I've heard good opinions of wxPython, but I've not used
it myself.
</p><p>
If you want to build a Web application, I see two paths. If you want
something not so spectacular but that gets you there fast, I recommend
Django. Django is very similar to Ruby on Rails. It's a framework in which
you use the model-view-controller paradigm and a relational database
such as MySQL or PostgreSQL; both are well supported on Python.
</p><p>
The other way to build Web sites (that I know of) is Zope. Zope is a big
framework with a Web server and object-oriented database. The
database is different from other relational databases, and it is
very powerful. It allows you to store information in a much more flexible
way. Zope 3&mdash;I don't recommend the previous versions unless you have
to use the award-winning content management system Plone&mdash;is prepared
to help you build reliable and robust code by means of interfaces,
unit testing, adapters and much more.

If you need to build any kind of d&aelig;mon&mdash;those little applications
running in the background making the earth turn&mdash;take
a look at Twisted Matrix. Twisted Matrix is an event-based
framework that solves a lot of the common problems of building
d&aelig;mons,
including separation of protocol and logic. It comes with many protocols
already built in, and it allows you to create new protocols. A proof of
its usefulness is that Zope, after years of shipping its own Web sever,
has migrated to using the Twisted Matrix HTTP server.
