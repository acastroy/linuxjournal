Puppy Love</h4><p>
I just finished reading the article on Puppy Linux
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, April 2008]. I'm glad to see you
introduce this distribution to your readers. I discovered PL about a year
and a half ago. Every year, my wife and I travel for about six months,
usually in our RV. During the 2007 travel period, I used PL exclusively to
use the Internet safely. I found no reason to look at any other
distribution. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants the
flexibility and security of using an operating system on a Flash drive. My
version of PL includes Firefox, OpenOffice.org and The GIMP.
</p><p>
I am not sure it was clear from the article, but because the PL OS is loaded
anew into the computer memory at each bootup and runs from that memory, any
possible corruption of the OS by an on-line attack probably would last
only until the computer is turned off. Next boot, fresh OS.

Forgotten gThumb</h4><p>
In the March 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, in the &ldquo;Desktop
Must-Haves&rdquo; article, author Dan
Sawyer seemed to have forgotten about gThumb as a photo importer and
organizer for the GNOME desktop environment, which also allows for photo
import (using the PTP protocol), supports slideshows, as well as providing a
limited array of image manipulation tasks (balance, contrast,
transformation, crop, red-eye removal and so on). It is pretty much standard
with many GNOME installations, and yet he didn't mention it,
favoring the rather &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; F-Spot (due to Mono and its status
regarding things such as Windows.Forms and so forth).
</p><p>
Generally, I like native applications better (due to the look and feel), but I
do agree with Mr Sawyer regarding all the applications he reviews in this
article, with the only exception being gThumb, which I think deserved to be
mentioned.

Quite honestly, Linux is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span> software universe, and I'd not run into
gThumb before I got your letter (it did not, alas, come standard with
any of my GNOME installations). I haven't had time to do a proper
assessment yet, but it looks very promising. Thanks for the
recommendation!
</p><p>
As for the controversiality of Mono, I make it a point to stay as far
away as possible from the infighting between various licensing and
project camps. Although I certainly have opinions on which toolkits work
best consistently, when it comes down to it, I care about the
functionality. If that functionality is coming from a Mono codebase or
a (until recently) Java codebase over/against another, less
controversial toolkit, and it saves to data formats that are easily
translatable and/or universally readable, then I have no quarrel with
it.
</p><p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm pleased you liked the article!

On Security in General</h4><p>
This letter is not related directly to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, but as a
magazine involved with
Internet security issues, I think some of the following reflections could
be considered by the readers and the magazine editors who can include some
article(s) and discussion(s) on this in the near future.
</p><p>
I am a professor at a university. I do research and I teach. I've used the
Internet since my old student days, when we FTPed, Telneted, fingered and
so forth.
Those were free days, free as in speech, free as in open source,
open as it was the Internet. But, then came the &ldquo;worms&rdquo;, and we closed the
doors. Later, we encrypted everything we sent, and built &ldquo;walls of
fire&rdquo;
and &ldquo;military zones&rdquo;. Now, we filter everything that comes
into or out of our
nets&mdash;sometimes on security grounds, sometimes to reduce traffic jams,
and sometimes because of copyright infringements.
</p><p>
In the past few years, the troubles created by these
&ldquo;policies&rdquo; have been greatly
affecting our work. Big institutions have created rules to close their
doors without regarding who might be affected. Sometimes we cannot even send
e-mail to some colleague because our domain (which can be as general
as .xy!!) is on a blacklist.
</p><p>
The most ridiculous extreme occurred last week. I advise students in different
institutions, and we interchange information, data and archives. At one of
these institutions, the SSH port was moved to a number greater
than 1024, at the other, all ports above 1024 were closed, even for client
connections. These measures were taken without notifying the users.
The result was wasting time trying to discover why what we always have done
(until
recently) does not work anymore, wasting time in adapting to the new
situation, and wasting time having unfruitful discussions with the system
managers.
</p><p>
The freedom to filter packets today is amazingly big, and the
Internet gradually is becoming a mess of entangled knots instead of
a fluid traffic Net.
</p><p>
We need standards&mdash;standards for security policies. We need to convince
security managers that the best security measure is just to unplug from
the Net, or maybe better, to switch off the computer! But this trivial
solution, as usual, has no interest to anybody, even to them. I can
(hardly) do research without the Internet, but they will lose their jobs
without it.
</p><p>
Security policies should be discussed with the end users who are, at last, the
reason we have the Internet.

Parallels and VMware Fusion</h4><p>
Dave Taylor's article on Parallels and VMware Fusion was a welcome sight
[&ldquo;Running Ubuntu as a Virtual OS in Mac OS X&rdquo; in the May 2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>].
I run Ubuntu 7.04 Server in Fusion on my MacBook, and it works great as
a portable server environment. I also can rely on the Ubuntu software
repository and get all the advantages of the Open Source world without
cluttering up my Mac OS X install. Hopefully, the Linux in Fusion user
base will grow over time, and VMware will implement more of the power-user features into its product. I would love to see a headless option
that doesn't involve force-quitting the Fusion UI.
</p><p>
Are there any plans for more detailed articles in the future? Fusion in
particular has some options (like port forwarding) that can be
enabled only through config file editing.

And, More on Dave Taylor's Mac Article</h4><p>
I really enjoyed this article. However, I did notice three things that I
don't really agree with.
</p><p>
First and foremost to me is the statement in the first paragraph that
Mac OS X is a Linux distro. This is wrong. Mac OS X is based on Darwin,
which is a BSD variant. BSD is not Linux and vice versa. They are
totally separate codebases, although there has been some cross-pollination.
</p><p>
Second, calling X11 &ldquo;a tightly integrated version of the popular Linux
windowing system&rdquo; is a bit off-base. X11 is a UNIX windowing system,
which originally was developed at MIT long before Linux ever
was envisioned. The paragraph is not really wrong, it's just a bit
misleading&mdash;at least as I read it.
</p><p>
Third, in the fifth paragraph, the author states, &ldquo;Free operating
systems (that is, anything but Microsoft Windows)....&rdquo; There are many
nonfree OS systems for Intel machines. Examples include OS/2 (okay, it is now
dead), DR-DOS (also dead), Pick (not dead, but has a rather small market
share&mdash;integrated OS/RDMS system) and Sun's Solaris (the commercial one).
On non-Intel machines, most OSes are not at all free, such as z/VM,
z/VSE, z/TPF, z/OS on IBM's &ldquo;mainframe&rdquo; System z, AIX on IBM's
System p and
i5/OS on IBM's System i. You may have noticed that I know a bit about
IBM machines. I've worked on them, although not for IBM, since the
mid-1970s.

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Oh jeez, sometimes I don't know how these gremlins get into the
computer and mess up my perfectly written articles. I mean, really,
I might have accidentally said that in my original piece as submitted,
but it's clearly wrong and I know it! Mac's Darwin roots are NEXTSTEP,
which itself was based on Mach 2.5 and 4.3BSD. Heck, I contributed to
4.3BSD! As you point out, X11 comes from the MIT Athena Project, and was
released years before Linux was even a dream. Mea culpa on both of 'em.
</p><p>
You gotta cut me some slack on the comment about other nonfree operating
systems for the Intel architecture, however. I was trying to be a bit
wry and sarcastic in my commentary. Of course, there are many commercial
operating systems that, outside of illegal P2P copies, are licensed and
tightly monitored, including the systems you mention and many more.
</p><p>
Suffice to say, we let a few gaffes slip through 
and apologize for any confusion they caused. Glad you enjoyed the
article. We'll get our facts straight next time, I promise.

I'm still not sure how Dave Taylor positions his column in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>.
It probably must be meant as a column for the pros&mdash;some kind of
&ldquo;who finds
the bugs I smuggled in&rdquo; thing. Surely it can't be for beginners
who'd
get frustrated by all the code that does not work the way the text makes
you believe.
</p><p>
In his May 2008 column, Dave wants to give us advice on error handling and
making scripts bulletproof, again without checking his own code snippets
for errors.
</p><p>
The <tt  >2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null</tt> output redirection will not
work as described, because
first, STDERR is redirected to where STDOUT is (currently still) wired to,
and then STDOUT is sent to data nirvana, but redirected STDERR will not
follow suit. The <tt  >&gt;&amp;1</tt> redirection does not mean
&ldquo;pass it on to STDOUT&rdquo; but
rather &ldquo;rewire yourself to where STDERR is right now&rdquo;. There
are multiple
possibilities to do it right, the most often used is <tt  >&gt;/dev/null
2&gt;&amp;1</tt>. This works because first STDOUT is plugged in to the
&ldquo;data store with
endless capacity&rdquo;, and only then is STDERR told to put its hose into
the
same bucket.

I just got a chance to read the May 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, and I wanted to write
with respect to the article &ldquo;Customizing Linux Live CDs, Part
I&rdquo;. It
is a nice article and covers similar techniques I used long ago when
remastering Knoppix (I remastered only if I needed something beyond
the knoppix.sh injection model). However, as the article is
discussing Debian-based distributions, I think it only fair to mention
Debian Live, which I and many others use to make live CDs of Debian.
With Debian Live, making a custom live CD is far easier than the
remastering described in the article. I think it would be worth
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers'
time (remastering, that is) to take a look at Debian Live:

</p><p>

On the one hand, this series is intentionally Ubuntu-centric, and for
Ubuntu fans, being able to customize one's favorite distro is worth
learning a little command-line voodoo. It's also, I think, a good way
to illustrate how to use compressed loopback filesystems.
</p><p>
But, you're right. I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention a simpler
way to achieve a similar thing! So, in Part III of this article [see page
XX], I mention Debian Live
and cite the link to their Wiki (which includes ample links to downloads
and so forth). Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
</p><a name="N0x17d4580.0x18c5370"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17d4580.0x18c5370"></a>Good News</h4><p>
Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Customizing Linux Live CDs, Part I&rdquo;
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, May 2008) was a great article, and the timing was
perfect (for me...and it's all about me, right?).
</p><p>
A buddy and I have been playing around with bootable-USB sticks using
different distros. Ideally, we want a fully functional desktop OS
that we literally can take with us anywhere. There are lots of apps we
want that are not on the live CD. Since you (and pendrivelinux) have
done the heavy lifting for us, setting up the remastered Ubuntu USB
stick was a breeze. We're not quite done tweaking yet, but our current
image is approaching 1.4GB. The final version will live on a 4GB stick,
but a valuable side benefit is that the 2GB Flash drive I'm using for
testing this will be passed around the office for people to give Linux
a test-drive.
</p><p>
So, with a stroke of the pen, you've not only provided tremendous value for
my subscription dollars, but you've also increased the ranks of Linux
users!
</p><p>
Oh, I also like the line numbering scheme you used for your scripts.

Wow, what a thoughtful, gratifying message! It gave me a boost just as I

The article on podcasting by Dan Sawyer in the May 2008 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> was of
particular interest to me, and it confirmed that recording calls using Skype
on Linux is a nontrivial issue. (I interview genre authors on my podcast,
Radio Free Bliss.)
</p><p>
However, to say that &ldquo;[t]here are a number of packages [that hijack the
DSP with a middleware layer] that'll do this&mdash;for a fee&mdash;on Windows
and Mac&rdquo; is not strictly true. Driven from Linux, I use PowerGramo with
Skype on Windows, the basic (and very functional) version of which is
free. I've had no problems using it.
</p><p>
As to why I choose to use Skype: well, most nontechnical people know the
Skype name much better than they know Gizmo. And, for every ten people
I've asked who have Skype, there are none who have Gizmo. It would be
very arrogant of me to demand that my guests sign up for a completely new
service, all for the sake of one 45-minute conversation. So, even though
my main machine is Linux, running Mandriva, I keep a Windows machine
around for podcast purposes. I fear, especially among the less technical,
that it's going to be a Skype-Win world for the forseeable future.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
KS Augustin  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Sawyer replies:</b></span>
Thanks for the correction and the additional information. I too tend
to do my Skyping on Windows, even though I actually record the calls on
Linux. I do this because all my Linux boxen are 64-bit systems, and
Skype, as yet, doesn't particularly play nice with 64-bit. Plus, running it
on an emulation layer can get a bit twitchy. One of these days, it'll
come out for 64-bit distros. Until then, I'll be using my Windows machine
as a conference-call PBX.
</p><p>
Such is life, sometimes.

Having read &ldquo;Go Green, Save Green with Linux&rdquo; in the April 2008 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I got red. James Gray spouting &ldquo;our fragile
planet's inability to support
an SUV-lifestyle&rdquo; is nonsense.
</p><p>
The planet will adapt. If the planet doesn't like what man is doing, then it
will wipe him out. The human race is just a blink in time for this planet.
It is a selfish attitude of personal survival that drives this fascist
mindset.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Mother Nature's Mayday&rdquo; is a farce, or skillfully exploited situation. It
is just a humanistic perspective applied to generate a human emotional
response. &ldquo;Mother Nature&rdquo; has no qualms, or an uneasy feeling or pang of
conscience, as to conduct or compunction, about life and death.
</p><p>
The bottom line of this article is about the &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo;. People are
frustrated with wasting money on inefficient products.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Stephen Baker  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>James Gray replies:</b></span>
Thank you for your reply. I appreciate your reading the article and value
your feedback.
</p><p>
Your point about the Earth &ldquo;caring&rdquo; whether humans survive or not is well
taken. In the grand scheme of things, we are merely one small part of a
resilient and dynamic natural system that doesn't choose its victims
indiscriminately.
</p><p>
On the other hand, I also hope you will accept my writing &ldquo;Nature's Mayday
calls&rdquo; for the metaphor that it is. Here, my intent was to illustrate how
the planet is giving us clear feedback that our actions are causing drastic
and perhaps permanent change to natural systems. Furthermore, although you
appear to believe that humans should just act however they will and face
the consequences, I personally feel that we humans have a moral obligation
to treat our Earth home with utmost respect. I think it is in our
enlightened self-interest to protect not only those natural systems that
sustain us, but also to not adversely affect the results of billions of
years of wondrous evolution.
</p><p>
Evolutionary biologists say that a sense of morality is hard-wired into our
genes. I am surprised you would lump me together with Hitler simply for
writing that my own moral compass leads me to convince others that better
natural resource management is a positive thing. 
</p><p>
Finally, though you dispute my point about the Earth's inability to support
an SUV lifestyle for billions, please note that this assertion has been
proven empirically in several studies. There are simply not enough
resources for all six billion-plus humans to enjoy our level of material
consumption. Please contact me if you would like to receive more
information about these studies.
Thanks again for your feedback.
