If you are dissatisfied with your laptop hard drive's performance, 
you should consider moving to a new state&mdash;solid state. Read on for
head-to-head comparisons between a standard laptop hard drive and a
solid state model.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f4300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> small laptops. If you ask any of my friends, they
will tell you that even a laptop with a 12" screen, no matter how cool,
is just too big for me. My very first laptop was a Toshiba Libretto 50CT,
which was around the size of a VHS tape (for those of you who remember
those), and from there, I have progressed through the Fujitsu P series
with a P2110, P7010 and now a P1610&mdash;an 8.9" ultra-portable tablet. I
use this laptop as my primary machine with few complaints, but when I
made the jump to a tiny 8.9" tablet from my old 10.6" sub-notebook, I also
had to drop from a 2.5" to a 1.8" hard drive.
</p><p>
For me, especially at first, a 1.8" hard drive wasn't the end of the
world. Even though I had upgraded to 5400rpm drives on my other laptops,
to me, the decrease in size for the overall laptop was worth any drop
in performance. Plus, until recently, it wasn't like I had much
choice: 1.8" drives maxed out at 4200rpm. Then I heard about solid
state drives. Unlike a traditional hard drive that relies on a head and
a spinning platter, solid state drives act more like Flash storage you
might use in your camera or on a USB key. Not only are there no moving
parts to wear out and much faster seek times, the 1.8" solid state drives
I saw touted faster sustained read and write times as well.
</p><p>
Although I have read a number of benchmarks and anecdotes about solid state
drives, it always seemed like a mixed bag. Windows users talked about
much faster startup times and better overall responsiveness, while the
Mac reviews I read seemed to indicate the difference in performance was
minimal. I didn't see too many benchmarks about Linux systems, and with
the high price tag of solid state drives, I went back and forth on
which price point I was willing to pay.
</p><p>
One day I decided to take the plunge and bought a 1.8" Samsung solid
state drive for my laptop. In the process, I have taken some comparison
benchmarks between my old drive and my new solid state drive. Although
statistics can be handy, I decided to take a more tangible approach to
my comparisons. I used some standard benchmark tools, but the majority
of my comparisons deal with everyday tasks to give you a better idea
of what it's really like to have a solid state drive on a Linux system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f4670"></a>
The Testing Methodology</h2></div></div><p>
First, I should tell you what hardware is being compared. All 
tests were run on my trusty Fujitsu P1610. It has an Intel 1.2GHz ULV
Core Solo processor with 1GB of RAM and is running Ubuntu 7.10. The original
hard drive was a 4200rpm Toshiba MK6006GAH, and I am comparing it to a
Samsung MCBOE32G8APR solid state drive. When reasonable, I tried to run
tests multiple times so I could get an average reading; however, just
so you know, most of the tests ended up being pretty consistent between
tries. Also, when necessary I rebooted the machine before performing
follow-up tests so that any files Linux might have cached into RAM would
not affect the results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f4778"></a>
Test 1: GRUB to Login</h2></div></div><p>
For the first test, I used a stopwatch to time how long it took the system
to go from the GRUB boot prompt to my login screen. Depending on how
you use your laptop, you may boot it every day, or you may hibernate or
suspend between uses. In either case, a slow boot time can be painful
when you want to get right to work. The boot process is both disk- and
processor-intensive, but even so, when comparing the results, you'll see
a significant difference:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
4200rpm: 50 seconds
</p></li><li><p>
SSD: 34 seconds
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f4a38"></a>
Test 2: Login to Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
The next logical test is the time it takes from your login to a usable
desktop. For my laptop, I use the default desktop environment that comes
with Ubuntu (GNOME), but I also have terminals, applets and
Firefox all launching at startup. As a result, my numbers might differ
a bit from yours, but they give a good sense of the difference
between the two drives:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
4200rpm: 59 seconds
</p></li><li><p>
SSD: 23 seconds
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Wow. Although I knew to a degree that it took some time for my desktop
to come up with the old hard drive, I didn't realize until this test
that it actually took almost an entire minute! By comparison, the SSD
took less than half the time, in part due to the increased read speed
and the much faster seek times, especially when loading files at random
(see the bonnie++ test below to corroborate this). So far, the SSD is
looking pretty good. If you combine both tests, the 4200rpm drive took
109 seconds&mdash;almost two minutes&mdash;to go from the GRUB prompt to a usable
desktop, and the SSD took 57 seconds&mdash;almost half the time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f4da8"></a>
Test 3: Untar the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
For the next test, I decided to time how long it took to extract the 2.6.22
kernel bzipped tarball. Now, because this tarball is bzipped, a good deal
of the stress on the system will be on the CPU, not the disk. However,
because most tarballs are compressed, and it is a pretty common desktop
activity, I thought it was still worth comparing. The results
weren't nearly as dramatic as the first two tests (due to the activity being mostly
CPU-bound), but the SSD still beats the 4200rpm drive by 13 seconds:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
4200rpm: 66 seconds
</p></li><li><p>
SSD: 53 seconds
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f5068"></a>
Test 4: Suspend to Disk</h2></div></div><p>
Many laptop users (myself included) rarely boot and shut down their
systems between uses. Instead, they rely on the hibernation and suspend
features to save their current state and resume to it quickly. With
hibernation, the laptop writes its current state to disk and powers
off. With suspend, the laptop keeps its current state in RAM and stays on
in a low-power state. Because the hibernation process is so disk-heavy,
I decided it would be a good way to test whether an SSD gave any speed
benefit. So, for the first test, I measured the time from enabling
hibernation until the system powered off:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
4200rpm: 75 seconds
</p></li><li><p>
SSD: 50 seconds
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Again, before I saw the numbers, I didn't realize it had taken more than 
one minute 15 seconds to shut down and preserve my 1GB of RAM. Although
the SSD still took some time, it beat the old drive by 25 seconds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f5380"></a>
Test 5: GRUB to Resume</h2></div></div><p>
The follow-up to my hibernate test was to resume from the hibernation
state. I started the clock once I pressed Enter at the GRUB prompt and
stopped it once I got to the login window for my locked screen:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
4200rpm: 83 seconds
</p></li><li><p>
SSD: 38 seconds
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This result really surprised me. The SSD fared
better than the 4200rpm drive when suspending to disk, but it was more than twice
as fast when resuming! When you compare the combined tests, the 4200rpm
drive takes 158 seconds to suspend and resume, and the SSD shortens the
process down to 88 seconds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f5698"></a>
Test 6: Traditional Benchmarks with hdparm and bonnie++</h2></div></div><p>
Even though the everyday benchmarks were enough to convince me of the speed
benefit of an SSD, I knew a lot of you also would want some raw data
to compare. So, I also ran hdparm and bonnie++ on both drives
with some interesting results. First, I ran hdparm three times in a row:
</p><p>
4200rpm:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda3:
 Timing cached reads: 1842 MB in 2.00 seconds = 921.90 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 64 MB in 3.08 seconds = 20.79 MB/sec
/dev/sda3:
 Timing cached reads: 1814 MB in 2.00 seconds = 907.56 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 64 MB in 3.08 seconds = 20.78 MB/sec
/dev/sda3:
 Timing cached reads: 1794 MB in 2.00 seconds = 897.43 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 62 MB in 3.04 seconds = 20.39 MB/sec
</pre>
</p><p>
SSD:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads: 1894 MB in 2.00 seconds = 947.80 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 80 MB in 3.07 seconds = 26.02 MB/sec
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads: 1894 MB in 2.00 seconds = 947.61 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 80 MB in 3.08 seconds = 26.00 MB/sec
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads: 1886 MB in 2.00 seconds = 943.86 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 78 MB in 3.00 seconds = 25.99 MB/sec
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the SSD certainly is faster; however, there is not 
nearly as large a margin as with some of the other tests. The bonnie++
results show a different story:
</p><p>

</pre>
</p><p>
Well, that's certainly a lot of data. A few numbers do stand out though. On
sequential output and input, the SSD's performance is almost twice
that of the 4200rpm drive, except in random seeks where it is actually
14 times faster with 1,226 seeks per second! Because there is no
spinning platter, random seeks are one area where a solid state drive
really shines. The next level of stats compares the speed of creating
files on the system sequentially and at random. It is here that we
see another huge advantage for the SSD, as it is five times faster at
sequential creates, six times faster at sequential deletes and almost
six times faster at random creates.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12fc580.0x13f5c70"></a>
Is It Worth It?</h2></div></div><p>
All of these numbers aside, the question you might be asking is, &ldquo;Is
it worth it?&rdquo; For me, the answer is a definite yes. Not only is my
system back to the snappiness I remember with past laptops, it also no longer
seems to get bogged down during disk-heavy operations like when my backup
software kicks off. That reminds me of another point&mdash;noise. With no
moving parts, the SSD is basically silent. The only noise on my laptop
now is from the fan. The other day I was using my laptop and noticed that
the fan had gone to almost top speed. After some time, I decided to check
the system temperature to see whether my laptop was really that hot. It turned
out that my network backup job had kicked off and was rsyncing. This is
a CPU- and disk-heavy operation, and with my old drive, I instantly
would know when it kicked off, because the system would slow down, and I would
hear the all-too-familiar clicking and clacking of my hard drive. Now,
due to the snappiness of the desktop and silence of the SSD, I wasn't
even aware the backup was happening.
</p><p>
Whether the performance of an SSD is worth it to you depends on a variety
of things. If you are stuck with a 1.8" 4200rpm drive like I was, there
aren't too many other options for you (although a 5400rpm 1.8" drive
should be available for purchase soon), but if you have a larger drive
with up to 7200rpm spindle speeds and SATA interfaces, you definitely
will want to compare the posted speeds of comparable drives&mdash;it's possible that
the current generation of SSDs won't offer you many speed benefits. There
also are other factors to consider, including the potential power savings
some SSDs offer. Plus, with the lack of moving parts, you not only get a
quieter system, you also potentially get a more durable one. On the
downside,
even with write-leveling technologies, there still are a finite number
of writes you can make to an SSD, although most manufacturers claim that
the life of an SSD still exceeds that of traditional drives.
</p><p>
If you do decide to get a solid state drive, be sure to do your
homework. There are a number of different laptop hard drive interfaces
these days, so if you have a 1.8" drive, be sure to check whether you
use a ZIF or non-ZIF connector. And, if you want to use a 1.8" SSD in
your 2.5" laptop, be sure that a compatible adapter exists (I've seen
some sellers include adapters as a package deal).
