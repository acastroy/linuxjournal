Pondus (<a href="http://www.ephys.de/software/pondus" target="_self">www.ephys.de/software/pondus</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
First up this month is a weight manager, Pondus. According to its
Web site: &ldquo;Pondus is a personal weight management program written in
Python and Gtk+2 released under the GPL. It aims to be simple to use,
lightweight and fast. The data can be plotted to get a quick overview of
the history of your weight and is stored in XML files for easy access
and modification with other programs.&rdquo; Simple it is, indeed, and the
installation isn't too shabby either. Pondus lets you track your
weight over a period of time and displays your progress with
a graph. It also switches between metric and imperial measurements.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10092f1.large.jpg"><img src="10092f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Lovely Minimalism of Pondus and My Weight Chart
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
In terms of dependencies, you need a few Python-related libraries
installed before you can start. Whenever you compile something, the
installer invariably asks for the development files, so make sure
you install the python-dev files first. If you still run into
problems, some Googling turned up a posting in a forum about some
of the packages on which Pondus depends:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
python 2.4.4-6
</p></li><li><p>
python-gobject 2.14.1-1
</p></li><li><p>
python-gtk2 2.12.1-1
</p></li><li><p>
python-matplotlib 0.90.1-2
</p></li><li><p>
python-support 0.7.6
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the dependencies are out of the way, download the source package
from the project's Web site, extract the contents and open a terminal
in the new folder.
</p><p>
As root, enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, Pondus should compile and even install itself in your
Applications menu. On my system, I found a new menu entry under
Utilities&rarr;Pondus. If you can't find Pondus on your menu, you can start it by
entering the command <tt  >pondus</tt>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Pondus is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> minimalist,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Upon entering Pondus, you'll
see a small window with five buttons. The first 
adds a line of data&mdash;that being your weight and the date for entry.
The second removes a line, and the third edits a line of data.
Once you have entered some weights and times, you then can display
it as a graph by clicking the fourth button. If you want to switch
between pounds and kilograms, the fifth button opens the settings
window and lets you change that (this is one of only two options,
the other is to remember the window size).
</p><p>
Tracking your progress is really what Pondus is about though, so you
will want to jump over to the graph section&mdash;the fourth button, or
Plot data. Click the button, and a window titled Plot Weight 
appears with a neat line graph representing your weight over a period of
time. If you look at the bottom right, there's a drop-down box with All
Time written in it. This allows you to filter out the rest of the
information to what you've had over the past year, or just the past month. If
you want to filter your time to something more specific, on the bottom
left are two fields called Select Date Range. Enter the start date
you want to see in the first field and the end date in the second field, click 
Update on the far right, and the graph will update with the selected
information. For those of you who want to save a copy of what
your progress has been, clicking the Save Plot button at the bottom
lets you save your graph as a .png file. I'm a weedy little
runt myself, so I'm not trying to lose weight, but rather <span   class="emphasis"><em>gain</em></span>
it, so check my screenshot for an example (which is in kilograms by the way,
I don't way 72 pounds).
</p><p>
Overall, Pondus is a very simple and clean application that will appeal
to many new PC users, as it sits in a nice and small window and doesn't
baffle you with a zillion options. I'm guessing that Pondus probably
will add more features over time, but hopefully not too many, as doing so
might alienate its target audience. It's a lovely, neat little program.

BeeDiff (<a href="http://www.beesoft.org/beediff.html" target="_self">www.beesoft.org/beediff.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
BeeDiff (beediff) is a GUI program for comparing text differences between
two files, and any differences will be highlighted in different colors
depending on the type of difference. Any differences found then can 
be deleted or copied between files. BeeDiff is developed with new Qt4
libraries, and as such, it's very quick and lightweight. It also happens
to be quite easy to install, which is another bonus.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
For installation purposes, you have two choices: an i586 binary or a
source tarball.
</p><p>
If you choose the binary, first download the provided tarball and extract
the contents to a folder of your choice.
</p><p>
Then, as root or using sudo, copy the binary to /usr/bin or your preferred
binary directory to run BeeDiff system-wide.
</p><p>
Next, copy the included icon, beediff.png, to /usr/share/icons or whichever icon directory you prefer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10092f2.large.jpg"><img src="10092f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. BeeDiff&mdash;the Insomniac Coder's Best Friend
</p></div></div><p>
If you would rather run BeeDiff locally, you can run it by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$./beediff
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2331488"></a></h2></div></div><p>
from whichever directory you've extracted it to. If your system is
set up right, you also might be able to run it simply by clicking on it in
your file manager.
</p><p>
If you would prefer to compile it (if you don't have an i586-compatible
processor, for example), that's also very easy.
Simply download and extract the tarball provided on the Web site, and open
a terminal in the new beediff folder.
</p><p>
As root or sudo, run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2331698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the script will do all the compiling and installation for you.
</p><p>
Once this is done, entering <tt  >beediff</tt> at the command line should launch
the program.
</p><p>
At first, I had an error running the binary or compiling it, and it was
due to having old libraries installed.
When I went to run the binary, I got this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nhoj@ubuntu:~/src/beediff_1.5_i586/beediff$ beediff
beediff: symbol lookup error: beediff: undefined symbol:
_ZN10QBoxLayout10setSpacingEi
</pre>
</p><p>
And, I got this with the source compilation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
QBtSeparator.cpp:139: error: 'const class QColor' 
 &#8618;has no member named 'darker'
QBtSeparator.cpp:142: error: 'const class QColor'

make: *** [tmp/QBtSeparator.o] Error 1
install: cannot stat `beediff': No such file or directory
nhoj@ubuntu:~/src/beediff$
</pre>
</p><p>
BeeDiff requires at least Qt 4.3&mdash;Piotr the author was using
4.3.2. Install the latest version you can along with the development
libraries. Once I installed these, BeeDiff ran, binary and source
included.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
BeeDiff is pretty much geared for comparing two files that have the same
origin, so comparing pieces of code and scripts will be the best use of
BeeDiff's abilities. Fire up BeeDiff and once inside, you'll notice two
main panes. Here, you will load a text file into each one. The left pane is
the original, and the right pane is for comparing against it. On the top right
of each pane is a button to browse for the file you want to load.
</p><p>
Once loaded, any different lines will be highlighted in different colors:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Red: lines that have been deleted.
</p></li><li><p>
Blue: lines that have been added.
</p></li><li><p>
Yellow-green: lines that have been changed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
After analyzing what lines are different, you then can take several
actions. Along the toolbar to the right (and in the menu under
Operations) are four icons: Remove all from left, Remove all from
right, Merge all to left and Merge all to right. The Remove buttons
obviously delete the text in question, but the Merge buttons let
you grab any divergent lines and copy them across to the other file and
save it&mdash;very handy.
</p><p>
BeeDiff is another no-nonsense application that does what it says on
the tin and doesn't pretend to be anything else. This program should
save scripters and coders many a late night of headaches and may prove
to be quite handy in this time of common allegations between companies and
projects of &ldquo;stolen code&rdquo;.

youtube-dl (<a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl" target="_self">www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
First up, this is a YouTube downloader. Not very interesting, as everyone
has used them before, right? Indeed, but a few months back, YouTube
changed some embedding options, rendering most of these lovely tools
useless. Well, this little script has been updated and downloads YouTube
videos just fine. To install, simply save the URL provided onto your
hard drive&mdash;that's it! Make sure you save the filename as is though,
not with an .html extension.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10092f3.large.jpg"><img src="10092f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. youtube-dl&mdash;a Groovy Command-Line Utility to Save YouTube Videos to
Hard Drive
</p></div></div><p>
To use it, open a console in the directory where you saved the
file. Make sure you can execute the file by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+x youtube-dl
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you're ready to go! Find your favorite YouTube clip and copy its
URL. Go back to your console and enter <tt  >./youtube-dl</tt>, and paste the clip's
URL after it, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./youtube-dl http://youtube.com/watch?v=tNTWwbYYlgU
</pre>
</p><p>
youtube-dl now saves it to your hard drive, and it even has a spiffy
text-based progress monitor. Once downloaded, the filename just
looks like random garbage. Rename the file to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nameofyourvideo</em></span>.flv
(the .flv extension is the most important part), and open it with a strong
video player such as VideoLAN or MPlayer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x272a6a8"></a>
getmsmp3 (MySpace Downloader, <a href="http://psydev.sourceforge.net/new/misc/getmsmp3" target="_self">psydev.sourceforge.net/new/misc/getmsmp3</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This clever little script runs on anything that has a Net connection
and Perl. It grabs MP3s from a MySpace page and saves them locally. Like
youtube-dl, this is not new, but it automates a number of things
and does it locally from your hard drive without weird requirements. The
best part is that it grabs all the songs and saves them in the format of
[band] - [song title].mp3 automatically. Like youtube-dl, simply save the
project file to your hard drive and flag it as executable, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+x getmsp3
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, simply run the script and enter the URL of the band you want after
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./getmsmp3 http://www.myspace.com/soundskp
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, we can't encourage you to download illegally, so I've
provided you with the URL of our own band, which you're welcome to download
(slightly redundant though, as we've provided the option to download
our files anyway).

FoxyTag (<a href="http://www.foxytag.com" target="_self">www.foxytag.com</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a project I'm dying to see the outcome of&mdash;a free (as in beer)
speed camera warning system designed to run across a large range of mobile
phones and GPS devices. FoxyTag is a collaborative system designed to
encourage users to share speed camera data&mdash;the more users and feedback,
the more reliable the system becomes. The system doesn't merely assume a
speed camera is in one place either. Users have the options to report
a permanent camera or the installation or removal of a mobile camera.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10092f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The People's Speed Camera Locator&mdash;FoxyTag
</p></div></div><p>
However, Michel Deriaz, the project's leader at Geneva University, isn't
trying to promote speeding or unsafe driving. According to FoxyTag's
Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
FoxyTag motivates neither speeding nor any other risky behavior, but
allows drivers to concentrate on the road instead of having their eyes
fixed on the speedometer, by fear of being flashed. We observe that
drivers tend to brake suddenly when they see a speed camera (even if
they are not speeding), which can provoke traffic jams or even accidents
(chain collisions or slidings, like in this video [see the Web site for the
link]). FoxyTag signals in advance the presence of speed cameras, so that
drivers have enough time to check their speed and adapt it if necessary.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As for mobile phones, any Java mobile phone with MIDP 2.0, CLDC 1.1
and Bluetooth should be compatible. For GPS systems, any Bluetooth
GPS should be compatible (including GPS modules of some navigation
systems), and Michel recommends a Sirf III GPS. Unfortunately, I have
neither. Hopefully, we can rustle up the needed hardware and cover
this project further. I'd love to see the results of this one.
