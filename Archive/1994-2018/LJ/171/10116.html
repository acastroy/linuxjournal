How to write a movie trivia game for Twitter.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2574580.0x266c4b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the past few months, I have become an addict. In fact, I went from
being a skeptic to being an evangelist, in a way that probably makes me
a poster case for a 12-step program. What is this evil thing that's
sucked up my brain and passion? It's not illegal; it's not something
I have to hide from my children; but, yes, it's pretty geeky, and it's
one of the fastest-growing services in the Web 2.0 universe: Twitter.
</p><p>
What I find most compelling about Twitter is that it's both popular
and nascent, and as a result, you can see its best practices evolve
before your eyes. Even in the few months I've been active with the
service, it has gone from just personal updates (as in &ldquo;Eating burger
at McD's. Back to meetings in :30&rdquo;) to more business uses and news
dissemination (&ldquo;Flash: Redbox hacked by card sniffers. See...&rdquo;).
</p><p>
In a nutshell, Twitter lets you send very short messages to dozens,
hundreds or even thousands of followers, and from a Linux/shell
scripting perspective, it's very cool because the API lets you 
send messages easily with a single line of code. But, let's get there in a
bit. First, we need something to transmit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2574580.0x266c828"></a>
Movie Trivia? Sure!</h2></div></div><p>
Because I can't seem to shake my enthusiasm for writing games as shell
scripts (speaking of psychological curiosities, that's another one for
you), I thought it would be interesting to write a movie trivia
game for Twitter. So, that's what we'll do.
</p><p>
The challenge is to figure out where the data will come from. I mean,
I built up a huge database of word history trivia for <a href="http://etymologic.com" target="_self">etymologic.com</a>,
and my buddy Kevin Savetz and I wrote more than 500 computer trivia questions
for <a href="http://trivial.net" target="_self">trivial.net</a>, and it's a huge amount of effort. Since creating those
sites, I've become too lazy to repeat the effort, so the question is
to identify a spot where I can leverage or repurpose existing
movie information that will lend itself to a trivia game.
</p><p>
For this effort, I'll use the Internet Movie Database (<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_self">www.imdb.com</a>),
which has an extraordinary amount of interesting movie trivia deep in
its database. One place to start is its random movie quote feature,
at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Games/randomquote.html" target="_self">www.imdb.com/Games/randomquote.html</a>, but truth be told, that
trivia is so darn obscure, I've never been able to identify any
of the quotes, and I'm quite a movie fanatic.
</p><p>
Let's make this more complicated instead, and start with the IMDb
top 250 movies list and isolate the quotes and trivia from those
movies. That list is at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" target="_self">www.imdb.com/chart/top</a>, and if you crack
it open, you'll see that each movie is referenced with a URL of this
form http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/.
</p><p>
This means a simple grep can pull out the URL of each and
every one of the top 250 movies. Utilizing curl, here's everything
you need:

<pre     class="programlisting">

curl -s http://www.imdb.com/chart/top | \
sed 's/&lt;/\
/g' | grep '/title/tt' | more

</pre>
</p><p>
The output isn't quite what we want, but it's getting pretty close
to a usable database with just this simple command, not even enough to
justify a shell script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a href="/title/tt0068646/"&gt;The Godfather
a href="/title/tt0111161/"&gt;The Shawshank Redemption
a href="/title/tt0071562/"&gt;The Godfather: Part II
a href="/title/tt0060196/"&gt;Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il
a href="/title/tt0110912/"&gt;Pulp Fiction
</pre>
</p><p>
To strip out only what we need, because we really just want to have a file
of 250 URLs of the top 250 movies, we merely need a tiny addition:

<pre     class="programlisting">

curl -s http://www.imdb.com/chart/top  | sed 's/&lt;/\
/g' | grep '/title/tt' | cut -d\" -f2

</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's the result:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/title/tt0068646/
/title/tt0111161/
/title/tt0071562/
/title/tt0060196/
/title/tt0110912/
...many, many lines skipped...
/title/tt0325980/
/title/tt0061809/
/title/tt0113247/
</pre>
</p><p>
It's easy to drop this all into a data file, fixing the URLs as we
go along so that they are fully qualified, with a simple additional
call to sed like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
| sed 's/^/http:\/\/www.imdb.com/'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we have a data file full of URLs, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/
</pre>
</p><p>
Visit this URL, and you'll find that it's the #1 top movie on IMDd,
the brilliant film <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Godfather</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2574580.0x266d118"></a>
Scraping Data for Fun</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, so we've figured out how to get a list of the top 250 movies
according to IMDb voters, but the question is, &ldquo;how can we get useful
information at this point?&rdquo; The answer is by going to each and every page and scraping
the content thereon.
</p><p>
Look at the page for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Godfather</em></span>, and immediately a simple trivia
question game comes to mind: in what year was a particular popular
movie released?
</p><p>
This can be done by simply grabbing the title of the page, which just
so happens to be the film name and year of release:


<pre     class="programlisting">

curl -s http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/ | grep '&lt;title&gt;'

</pre>
</p><p>
It's not quite what we want, but pretty darn close:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;title&gt;The Godfather (1972)&lt;/title&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
It's close enough that we now can write a short script that takes an IMDb
movie title URL and outputs the movie name followed by a pipe symbol
(a convenient field separator) and the year the film was released:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

# given an IMDb film URL, output title &amp; release year

curl -s "$1" | \
  grep '&lt;title&gt;' | cut -d\&gt; -f2 | cut -d\&lt; -f1 | \
  sed 's/([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])/| &amp;/' | sed 's/(//;s/)//'

exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
(The complicated sed regular expression is to ensure that we don't merely
match the open parenthesis, just in case the movie title includes
parentheses.)
</p><p>
With that written, now we simply can pour the list into the script and
pull a quick list of the top ten films:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in $(cat top250.txt)
do
./get-film-info.sh $name
done | head -10
</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's the output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The Godfather | 1972
The Shawshank Redemption | 1994
The Godfather: Part II | 1974
Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il | 1966
Pulp Fiction | 1994
Schindler's List | 1993
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest | 1975
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back | 1980
Casablanca | 1942
Shichinin no samurai | 1954
</pre>
</p><p>
Cool. Now we're getting somewhere. Let's stop here, and next month,
I'll look at pulling out a random entry from the 250 entries, then
generate three random numbers numerically close to the correct year
and present all four as possible answers to the question, &ldquo;when was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>XX</em></span> released?&rdquo;
</p><p>
For now, I think I'll pop <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casablanca</em></span> in to my Blu-ray player and
relax while the team at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> struggles with
laying out the
column.
See ya later, shweetheart.
