Storage needs always seem to grow, but when you are ready to upgrade to
a new hard drive, how do you transfer all those files? Read on for
a tried-and-true method to migrate all your old files to a new drive.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x13403b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In another article in this issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
[page 84], I talk about my experiences
with the new solid state drive (SSD) I installed on my laptop. One of the
things I didn't mention in the article was how I transferred
all my data and settings to the new drive. There are a
number of ways to solve this problem. For instance, you could image the
old drive onto the new one and then grow the last partition to fill up
the presumably larger disk (which wouldn't work for me, as my new SSD
actually was substantially smaller than the old drive). Other people just
re-install their OS every time they get a new drive and then transfer their
/home directory and other settings, but I've always had just enough custom
programs and settings on my laptop for that method to be a pain. You also could
use rsync with certain flags to migrate the files, and although I do
like that method for network transfers, for local transfers, it can be a
hassle, because it first must scan through the entire drive before it begins.
</p><p>
I've done many hard drive migrations during the years with a tried-and-true
combination of find piped to cpio. I like this method because it uses
common tools that are sure to be installed, it starts immediately
and doesn't need to scan the drive, and with the right flags, it 
correctly can handle (and avoid) special filesystems, such as /proc, /sys
and so on. So far, it hasn't failed me, and this migration was no
exception. However, this time, I did run into a few gotchas that I will
talk about shortly. First, onto the basic steps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x1340670"></a>
1. Move to a Safe State</h2></div></div><p>
You don't want files to be changed as you are copying them, so you don't
want to do this migration from your normal desktop environment. Typically,
I boot in to a rescue disk like Knoppix, so that the filesystem stays
frozen. Other times, I simply switch to single-user mode, so most files
won't change. For desktop systems, I generally just connect both drives
directly to the system, and for laptops, I use a USB hard drive adapter,
so that both can be connected at the same time. For my last migration, I
didn't happen to have a USB adapter for a 1.8" drive, so I transferred
the data to an intermediate drive first, then installed the new drive
and transferred again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x1340778"></a>
2. Partition Your New Drive and Format the Filesystems</h2></div></div><p>
You can use any partitioning tool that works for you&mdash;from fdisk to
qtparted. This may sound obvious, but make sure that you allocate plenty of
room to fit your existing data, and if you move to a larger hard drive,
plenty of room to grow. Once you partition the drive, use mkfs or your
preferred formatting tool to write a filesystem to each partition
(or mkswap for the swap partition).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x13408d8"></a>
3. Mount the New Partitions</h2></div></div><p>
Create mountpoints under /mnt for the new partitions you have
created. For my example, I have a root partition at /dev/sdb1 and a home
partition at /dev/sdb3, so I would type as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /mnt/sdb1
mkdir /mnt/sdb3
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1
mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/sdb3
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run this from a rescue disk, you also need to make sure your
source partitions are mounted as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x1340a90"></a>
4. Run the find | cpio Spell</h2></div></div><p>
Now this spell doesn't have a lot to it, but it's funny how you memorize
scripts like this over the years after using them and passing them along to
friends. First, change to the root level of the partition you want to copy
and then execute the command as root. So, to migrate my root partition
from single-user mode, I did the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /
find ./ -xdev -print0 | cpio -pa0V /mnt/sdb1
</pre>
</p><p>
To migrate from a rescue disk, the command is almost identical, but you change to the mountpoint of the source partition instead (I mounted it
at /dev/sda1):

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt/sda1
find ./ -xdev -print0 | cpio -pa0V /mnt/sdb1
</pre>
</p><p>
The find command searches through the entire root partition for files and
directories. The -xdev flag tells find to stay within the current mounted
filesystem. Otherwise, when find gets to /home, it would copy the contents
of that directory as well and potentially fill up the new partition. It
then passes the files to cpio, which places them under my new mountpoint while preserving permissions, symlinks and other settings. The
cpio command also outputs one dot for each file it copies, so you can
have some sense of its progress. However, what I typically do is go to
another terminal and monitor the output of df so I can watch it grow:

<pre     class="programlisting">
watch df
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the first find | cpio command completes, repeat it for each of your
other partitions. In my example, if I were in single-user mode, I'd do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home
find ./ -xdev -print0 | cpio -pa0V /mnt/sdb3
</pre>
</p><p>
If I were using a rescue disk, I'd do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt/sda3
find ./ -xdev -print0 | cpio -pa0V /mnt/sdb3
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x1340eb0"></a>
5. Update fstab</h2></div></div><p>
What you do during this step will vary a bit, depending on how you set
up your partitions. If you moved your partition layout around, you 
need to edit the /etc/fstab file on your new root partition so that it
reflects the new drives you have set up.
</p><p>
Traditionally, this has been a simple step for me, because I try to order
the partitions the same and generally don't have to touch fstab,
but on this last migration, I had to add an extra step due to Ubuntu's
use of UUIDs to reference partitions. A lot of modern distributions
don't refer to partitions by their device name. Instead, a unique
identifier called the UUID is assigned to each partition. If you
see UUID=longstringofhex in your /etc/fstab, this means you. 
</p><p>
Now,
you have two choices here. The first choice is to change all these
UUID lines to reference the actual device. This will work, and is less
prone to typos that will make the system not boot, but you will lose the
advantage of UUIDs. The other method is to reference the UUIDs for your
new partitions and put them in place of the old UUIDs. You can find the
list of disk-to-UUID mappings under /dev/disk/by-uuid:

<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@minimus:~$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2008-04-06 16:00 
 &#8618;634719fd-a6da-4fee-8646-0d485d7681db -&gt; ../../sda2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2008-04-06 16:00 
 &#8618;665d7008-fde9-4055-8af9-483697acb005 -&gt; ../../sda1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2008-04-06 16:00 
 &#8618;cf3892fd-e3d8-446f-8552-4c633be9c382 -&gt; ../../sda3
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you always could choose a hybrid of the two approaches, and
set the hard device names in the fstab for the first boot, and then once
you have confirmed the system boots, you then can update fstab with UUIDs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x1341118"></a>
6. Update GRUB</h2></div></div><p>
As with fstab, if you changed your partition layout, you need to
update your GRUB configuration under /boot/grub/menu.lst (or on some
systems, in /boot/grub/grub.conf) to reflect your changes. Also, GRUB can
reference drives by UUID, so if you see references to UUID in the GRUB
configuration file, be sure to update it to reflect the new
values. Once
the file has been updated, chroot into your new root partition's mountpoint and then run grub-install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chroot /mnt/sdb1 /usr/sbin/grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb
</pre>
</p><p>
Change /mnt/sdb1 and /dev/sdb to reflect your new mounted root partition
and its disk device, respectively. If the chrooted grub-install doesn't
work, you typically can use your rescue disk (or single user) grub-install
with the --root-directory option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/grub-install --recheck --root-directory /mnt/sdb1 /dev/sdb
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1248580.0x13413d8"></a>
7. (Optionally) Update the Initial Ramdisk</h2></div></div><p>
After I used my new system for some time, I noticed it wouldn't
resume correctly from hibernation. It seemed like each time the swap
partition would get corrupted. After some troubleshooting, I found that
the root cause was a hard-coded resume device based on UUID that is
put in the initial ramdisk for the machine. You may or may not run into
this issue, depending on your Linux distribution, as each distribution
manages its initrd differently. But, here is the fix for my Ubuntu
system. I was able to find the offending reference to the old UUID in
/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume. All I needed to do was update that
file on the new drive to point to the new UUID for my swap partition,
then run update-initramfs from the new system, and reboot.
