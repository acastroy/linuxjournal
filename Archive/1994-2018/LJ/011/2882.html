features and has been designed to comply with the POSIX shell
standard. At the same time, PKSH has been enhanced to boost
programmer productivity through improved performance and support
for re-use and extensions. New features and program improvements
include new commands, additional variables, support of associative
as well as indexed arrays, and support for compound data objects
and discipline functions.</p><p>PKSH is available for Linux for $149 for a binary license for
one system. Please contact Ed Cartier, AT&amp;T Licensing,

V3.1</h2></div></div><p>Softfocus formally announced the release of a Linux version
of their popular BTree/ISAM file manager. BTree/ISAM is a complete
random and sequential file management library written entirely in
portable C. Available since 1982, it is currently in use worldwide
on a wide range of operating systems and compilers. The
distribution includes complete source code, excellent
documentation, and technical support through email, phone, fax, and
BBS.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, we've been actively supporting Linux for over a
year now,&rdquo; says Jon Simkins, president of Softfocus, &ldquo;We take pride
in the portability of our software to all robust C platforms and
Linux certainly qualifies there. But interest in Linux as a serious
development platform has increased dramatically over the last
several months and we thought we'd better let the world know that
BTree/ISAM v3.1 is Linux compatible.&rdquo; Simkins added that the low
cost and high performance of BTree/ISAM make it very popular with
Linux developers.</p><p>Simkins is effusive in his praise for Linux. &ldquo;I first
installed Linux last year after one of my clients recommended it. I
was immediately surprised by how robust and complete a system this
was. Linux is now my principle development system and it's no
exaggeration to say I'd be lost without it. The quality of the C
development tools made the BTree/ISAM port trivial.&rdquo;</p><p>Softfocus may be contacted at: Softfocus, 1343 Stanbury Rd.,
