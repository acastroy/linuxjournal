way to develop X applications or add a graphical front-end to
existing code (see <a href="../008/0008.html" target="_self"><i  >Linux Journal</i>
#8</a>). Plus John Osterhout, the author of Tcl, is now working
for Sun&mdash;and Sun is talking about turning Tcl into a serious
product. In this book, Osterhout offers an introduction and
overview of Tcl and Tk to get you started and continues on to the
serious stuff.</p><p>The first part of the book following the introduction covers
the Tcl language itself&mdash;chapters include syntax, variables,
expressions, lists, flow of control, procedures, string
manipulation, file access, processes and error handling&mdash;and ends
with chapters on tcl internals and the history mechanism.</p><p>Next, the book covers the Tk toolkit for writing X-Windows
applications. Again, there are a lot of chapters covering widgets,
geometry managers, bindings, focus, window managers, communications
between applications and invocation of procedures by real-world
events. The final chapters discuss configuration, assorted commands
and concepts that don't fit elsewhere and also give two
applications examples.</p><p>The end of the book covers working with Tcl and C, and
working with Tk and C. The Tcl chapters first tell you why you may
want to combine Tcl with C and then explain how the interface works
and how to develop code using it. There are a liberal number of
examples. The Tk and C chapters thoroughly cover the nitty-gritty
of the Tk/X interface. If you are not familiar with X-Windows
programming, this looks a little scary, but it isn't the fault of
Tcl/Tk.</p><p>The book ends with an appendix that points you at ftp sites
where you can get software and a brief description of how to get it
running. There are 450 pages of information contained in the
book.</p><p>I am not a Tcl/Tk programmer and got the book to start from
scratch. When I first looked at the book it reminded me a lot of
The C Programming Language written by Kernighan and Ritchie
(K&amp;R), who also wrote the C language. Osterhout's book, like
K&amp;R's, begins with an overview and then continues by showing
the reader all the details. A &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; program is used early
on as a programming example and this illustrates that both Tcl and
C are relatively simple languages. Also of note, is that Brian
Kernighan is Addison-Wesley's consulting editor for a series of
books.</p><p>I remember reading K&amp;R, writing some C code, being a
little frustrated, going back, learning more and eventually
learning C. When I was learning C (1980) K&amp;R was the only book
out there. Today, even though there are hundreds of books on C, I
still use K&amp;R for reference and don't look in other C texts for
information.</p><p>I have played a little with Tcl/Tk using this book and have
felt more than a little frustrated. After looking over the book
again, my conclusion is that it covers the language in detail as a
tutorial, but it is not a good reference book. In the case of C, I
use SSC's C Library Reference (a pocket-sized guide that I wrote)
as a quick reference. Then I use K&amp;R for additional reference,
if needed, because it offers information in an easy-to-find
format.</p><p>Osterhout's book isn't going to be the book you use when you
are writing code and need to look something up. I see it as one of
the tools you utilize to get started with Tcl/Tk, but a second,
smaller book or pocket guide is necessary to help you with the nuts
and bolts as you actually do development. Is it worth buying? Yes.
But life will be easier when a reference exists that will
complement this book.</p></div></div>
