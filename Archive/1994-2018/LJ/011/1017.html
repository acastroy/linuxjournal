    A lot of noise has been made lately about &ldquo;Computer
    Supported Cooperative Work&rdquo; (CSCW) and &ldquo;groupware&rdquo;. This is
    an introduction to using an interesting CSCW product, which
    is licensed under the GNU GPL and is available for Linux.
    Another article will cover building a small CSCW application
    with LINCKS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd65450"></a></h2></div></div><p>LINCKS is a multi-user, client-server,
object-centered database system built on top of a storage server
called NODE. The storage server provides LINCKS with an
append-only, object-centered database and object development
history (&ldquo;from which object was this object created?&rdquo;), temporal
history (relationship between objects), and optional command
history (which is not enabled by default). An object consists of an
image section, where anything can be stored (text, images, sounds,
etc.); a set of attributes which, in a sense, types the object; and
a set of links to other objects.
</p><p>The current main user interface, <b  >xlincks</b>,
is an X11 application that allows you to edit and browse a LINCKS
database in a hypertext fashion, using Emacs-like commands.
<b  >xlincks</b> provides a basic environment for
document editing in a work-group setting, but provides only limited
mark-up facilities at this time. The hypertext nature of LINCKS,
together with the advanced view support, allows easy sharing of
information and re-use of parts of documents (section, subsection,
or paragraph) simply by creating links to the parts to be
used.</p><p>A view is a definition of how to present the data to the
user. You can define your own views, which are stored and edited
like any other objects in the database. You define the logical
structure (parts and their order), the location in the database
from which to retrieve the different parts and the formatting
attributes for the objects. By applying different views to the same
objects, you are able to look at a document, for example, as a
&ldquo;full document&rdquo;, as a &ldquo;document overview&rdquo;, or as only the highest
level, the table of contents. Any editing of an object performed in
one view is automatically propagated to all views built from
(containing) the same object.</p><p>Also, when several users edit the same documents in a
database, LINCKS issues warnings when parallel editing of the same
object (a section, subsection, paragraph, etc.) occurs. Thus, you
can coordinate your work with other people working with you using a
secondary channel (email, <b  >talk</b>, telephone, etc.)
for synchronization.</p><p>LINCKS has its origin as a research database system,
developed at the Intelligent Information System Laboratory at the
University of Link&ouml;ping, Sweden. We released LINCKS under the
GNU GPL in the Autumn 1993, to gain feedback from outside
researchers and users. Since then, we have ported LINCKS to SunOS
4.1.x, SunOS 5.x, Ultrix, AIX, Dynix, Linux, HP-UX, IRIX, SCO,
4.3BSD Reno, and DEC OSF/1 Alpha. It is running under X11R5, X11R6,
and OpenWindows (and even X11R4, but not with full functionality).
We ported LINCKS to Linux to enable us to run demonstrations on a
portable unix box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd657c0"></a>Installing and Running LINCKS</h2></div></div><p>To run LINCKS, you must be running the RPC port-mapper
(normally started from /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2), a kernel with TCP/IP,
and X11 for <b  >xlincks</b>. Also, you will need at
least 8MB of RAM to run the database servers and the X11
application interface <b  >xlincks</b> on the same
machine.</p><p>To install the LINCKS binary distribution
(lincks2x.ybin.tgz), you first should create a new user who will
own the database, perhaps called &ldquo;lincks&rdquo; (It is not a good idea to
install LINCKS as &ldquo;root&rdquo;).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>As root, <b  >cd</b> / and un-tar the
zipped tar archive.</p></li><li><p>If you created a special LINCKS user, change the
owner of all the files in /usr/local/lincks/ directory by typing
<b  >chown -R lincks /usr/local/lincks</b>.</p></li><li><p>Then make /usr/local/bin/dbpasswd set-user-id
&ldquo;lincks&rdquo; by typing <b  >chown lincks
/usr/local/bin/dbpasswd</b> and <b  >chmod +s
/usr/local/bin/dbpasswd</b> to enable users to modify their
own passwords, even though the files are owned by &ldquo;lincks&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Finally, running as user &ldquo;lincks&rdquo; start the
database server by typing <b  >lincks -s
/usr/local/lincks/DB</b></p></li></ul></div><p>The next step is either to continue reading this article or
run the interactive tutorial. To start the on-line tutorial, you
invoke <b  >xlincks</b> with
<b  >xlincks/usr/local/lincks/DB</b>. You will be
prompted for your LINCKS login and password; give the user name
&ldquo;demo&rdquo; and the password &ldquo;demo&rdquo;.
</p><p>The following is the LINCKS directory hierarchy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>usr/local/man/{manl,catl} for formatted and
preformatted manual pages</p></li><li><p>usr/local/bin/ for the LINCKS programs</p></li><li><p>usr/local/lincks/ is the main LINCKS directory with
a &ldquo;ready-to-run&rdquo; database in the DB subdirectory, postscript
documentation, FAQ, README, etc. The bitmaps subdirectory contains
X11 bitmaps which might be missing on few systems.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd66268"></a>System Description</h2></div></div><p>LINCKS consists of eleven different programs which can
divided into three different classes: the database server
(<b  >monitor</b>, <b  >netserv</b>, and
<b  >dbs</b>); general utility programs
(<b  >dbpasswd</b>, <b  >dbdump</b>,
<b  >dbroot</b>, <b  >t2lincks</b> and
<b  >cutoff</b> which are normal clients), and the main
application program (<b  >xlincks</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd66688"></a>Database Directory</h2></div></div><p>Both the application program and the utility programs take
the last argument to be a path to a directory with the LINCKS
database files. If you are only running one database server, or if
you get tired of typing the path to the database directory, simply
set the environment variable <b  >LINCKSDBDIR</b> to
point to this directory and omit the path. A typical database
directory might look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>The .lincksrc is the configuration file which tells the
LINCKS software where to find the database directory, log file
directory, executable, TCP/IP port, etc. The passwd file contains a
user name, a user id, and an encrypted password for each user.
Access protection is defined by the groups file and by an optional
wrgroups file. The <b  >dbs</b> processes, stores, and
retrieves objects and their contents in the 1.dat and 1.mol files.
The <b  >monitor</b> process uses the
<b  >index</b> file for storing the object
identifications for each object. The *.names files contain the
names of all the *.dat and *.mol files, which hold the actual
data.</p><p>Whenever a LINCKS program accesses the index file, it must
create a .indexfile.lock file, which contains the program name, its
process id, and current host name. For more information, please see
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LINCKS System Administration
Manual</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd66a50"></a>The Database Server</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >monitor</b> process serializes object
creation, imposes access control, and provides for parallel editing
notifications. The monitor allows you to define which objects a
particular user has <span   class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> access via the group file and the
optional wrgroups file.</p><p>The <b  >netserv</b> process handles connections
from all clients. After validating the user name and password
against the <b  >passwd</b> file (which is changed using
<b  >dbpasswd</b>), <b  >netserv</b> forks and
creates the <b  >dbs</b> process for each connected
client.</p><p>Each <b  >dbs</b> process interacts with one
client. It retrieves and stores objects in the *.dat and *.mol
files using the monitor to ensure unique object identifiers and to
synchronize access to the common database files. The
<b  >dbs</b> process dies when the client process closes
the connection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd5d808"></a>Utility Programs</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >lincks</b> program is used to start a
LINCKS database server. If the database server is interrupted by a
system crash, an .indexfile.lock file exists, but no LINCKS
software is running. You will receive a warning message. Just
remove the lock file (first check for a running process, please!)
and re-execute the lincks command.</p><p>The <b  >dbstat</b> utility is used to check for a
running database server (<b  >monitor</b> and
<b  >netserv</b>). <b  >dbstat</b> connects to
the netserv and monitor processes and returns some status
information, as shown in Figure 1, <b  >dbstat</b></p><p>You use <b  >dbpasswd</b> to add or to change a
user's password. It is installed suid to enable every user to
modify his or her own password, which is encrypted by default. When
you add a new user, you must edit the <b  >passwd</b>,
groups and, if you use it, wrgroups files by hand. When you are
finished editing, restart the database server to enable the monitor
to re-read the protection files.</p><p>To export or dump a LINCKS database, use the dbdump program,
which exports a whole LINCKS database in text format. If you have
stored any binary object in the database (images, sounds, object
code, etc) <b  >dbdump</b> will create a file for each of
the binary objects. You use <b  >t2lincks</b> to import
an exported database. Of course, <b  >t2lincks</b> can
also be used to import an object or any information into a
database&mdash;registers or articles, for example&mdash;as long as it is in
the proper format (see the <b  >t2lincks</b> manual
pages).</p><p><a href="1017f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.</b></span>
<b  >dbstat</b></a></p><p>The two last utilities are not used very
often&mdash;<b  >dbroot</b> creates a completely empty
database (it destroys any existing objects in the database if any
already exist). You only run <b  >dbroot</b> when setting
up a new database. To garbage collect a LINCKS database run cutoff,
which removes all objects which are not referenced by any other
objects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd5e0a0"></a>Application Programs&mdash;<b  >xlincks</b></h2></div></div><p>To edit and browse a LINCKS database, you have to use the X11
interface application program, <b  >xlincks</b>. If you
are using a small screen, you would probably like to change the
.Xdefaults as described in LINCKS.FAQ. Also, you might install
lincks2x.ydb.tgz, which contains a database using smaller fonts. If
you are installing LINCKS from the source distributions, see the
script DB/scalefonts.</p><p>When started up, <b  >xlincks</b> will create a
series of windows. For each one, use the mouse to place it where
you want it, then click the left button. (In these directions, if
the mouse button is not otherwise specified, use the left button.)
One of the windows should be the <b  >xlincks</b> command
menu (see Figure 2, &ldquo;Logged in as
<b  >emptyuser4</b>&rdquo;).</p><p>Much of the information in a database is organized
hierarchically. When you start up <b  >xlincks</b>, you
should get one or more windows which are your entry points into the
database. In Figure 2, we have logged in as user emptyuser4. To see
more of the database, &ldquo;expand&rdquo; (see &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; below) some item in
a window, thereby using it as the root of a new window.</p><p><a href="1017f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Logged in as</b></span>
<b  >emptyuser4</b></a></p><p>The following convention is often used: &lt;&lt;xxx&gt;&gt;
usually means &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; is a placeholder. A placeholder indicates that
the view calls for something of type &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; to be in this place.
Editing the placeholder will then create something of type &ldquo;xxx&rdquo; in
the database. A box (frame) around an item often means that it's
something that can be expanded. This is, however, simply a
convention used by some views.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd5e620"></a>On-Line Help</h2></div></div><p>There are two kinds of on-line help: the help text associated
with a particular button in the command menu and on-line
documentation. You get the button help text by clicking on the
button, about which you wish to know more, using the right mouse
button.</p><p>When you log in, you should get a window called &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; All
of the on-line documentation is organized under this window. You
can &ldquo;expand&rdquo; the appropriate items to see the documentation. This
is not true for the tutorial account, but there is a button in the
command menu called &ldquo;Help Window ...&rdquo; which will bring up the
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; window if you click on it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd5e780"></a>Expanding or Following a Link</h2></div></div><p>To expand something, click with the left mouse button on the
thing you want to expand, while at the same time holding down the
&ldquo;Control&rdquo; button. This will open a new window. The key command
<b  >meta-l meta-e</b> has the same effect. Or you click
with the middle mouse button on the thing you want to expand while
at the same time holding down the Control button; this will expand
the item and reuse the window. The key command <b  >meta-l
meta-E</b> (note the capital E) has the same effect.</p><p>The previous paragraph described how to expand something
using the default view, or GPD (General Presentation Descriptor) in
LINCKS parlance. To expand something using a view other than the
default, click on the &ldquo;Expand ...&rdquo; command menu button, which will
bring up a menu of GPDs. Next, click on the item you wish to expand
and then click (in the menu) on the GPD you wish to use. For
example, if you wish to see something in &ldquo;node view&rdquo; (the entire
database object), click on the item you want to see, bring up the
menu, and click on the menu item &ldquo;node&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0xd5e990"></a>A Very Small Example</h2></div></div><p>Using <b  >xlincks</b>, log in using user name
<b  >emptyuser4</b> and password emptyuser4. You should
get the windows, as in Figure 2.</p><p>First, we'll add a link in the &ldquo;Empty User 4&rdquo; window to the
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; window:</p><p><a href="1017f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. After
adding a link</b></span></a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Click on the item to which you wish to have a link
(the source), in this case, the line &ldquo;Things You Can Do In
<b  >xlincks</b> in the &rdquo;Help!&ldquo; window&rdquo;, then</p></li><li><p>Click on the item after which we wish to put the
link (the destination), that is the
<b  >&lt;&lt;item&gt;&gt;</b> in the &ldquo;Empty User
4&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Finally, click on the command menu &ldquo;Add Link&rdquo;
button in the command menu.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now the &ldquo;Empty User 4&rdquo; windows should look as in Figure 3,
&ldquo;After adding a link&rdquo;. For fun, try to expand the &ldquo;Simon Says&rdquo; and
see if you really get the &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; window.
</p><p><a href="1017f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. After
inserting a plural item</b></span></a></p><p>Now we'll start writing our upcoming article for <i  >Linux Journal</i> about &ldquo;Linux on the Road&rdquo;. We prefer to store the article
in our home directory (the &ldquo;Empty User 4&rdquo; window). First, move the
cursor to the &ldquo;Simon Says.&rdquo; line in &ldquo;Empty User 4&rdquo; window. Then,
insert a new item in folder view by giving the command meta-l
meta-i (insert closest plural), which will create a sibling of the
current item. (See &ldquo;The xlincks User&rdquo; manual or the next part of
this series for more information.)</p><p>Now, replace the &ldquo;item&rdquo; as displayed in Figure 4, &ldquo;After
inserting a plural item&rdquo;, with &rdquo;Linux on the Road&ldquo;.</p><p>Then, move to &ldquo;Linux on the Road&rdquo; and expand it using
<b  >meta-l meta-e</b> (or control-left-button if you
like), yielding the result in Figure 5.</p><p><a href="1017f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Specify the expansion view</b></span></a></p><p>Now, replace the &ldquo;empty: GPD name&rdquo; with &ldquo;full document&rdquo; which
is the name of the view (GPD) we'll use. Expand on the &ldquo;full
document&rdquo; line, which gives us a full view of the document as shown
in Figure 6. (You might need to move out of the line to make the
change take effect, before you expand it.)</p><p><a href="1017f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6. Full
document view</b></span></a></p><p>Now we can start writing using the regular Emacs-like command
for editing and the <b  >meta-l</b> prefix commands for
inserting and deleting structure items.</p><p>When the document is getting long, we tend to lose the
overview of the different parts&mdash;we are no long able to see the
forest for all trees. To get a top-level table of contents of our
document, &ldquo;Linux on the Road&rdquo;, simply:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Select the title of the &ldquo;Linux on the Road&rdquo;
document.</p></li><li><p>Press the &ldquo;Expand ...&rdquo; button on the command
menu.</p></li><li><p>Select/press the &ldquo;document contents&rdquo; in expand
menu.</p></li></ul></div><p>and we should get something like Figure 7.
</p><p><a href="1017f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.
Document Overview</b></span></a></p><p>Now, change the title or author field in one of the windows.
Then move out of the field and watch what happens. The change
propagates to all other views built from the same content
object.</p><p>Lastly, we remove the &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; item from our home directory.
Move to the &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; item in &ldquo;Empty User 4&rdquo; type <b  >meta-l
meta-r</b> (for remove closest plural) to remove it.</p><p>We must save to the database server to make our changes
permanent, since all our editing so far has been done in the
client. To save the contents of a window, we only have to press the
&ldquo;Store&rdquo; button or type <b  >control-x</b>,
<b  >control-s</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6d580.0x10731c0"></a>Last words</h2></div></div><p>In the next article, we will cover in more detail how to
define your own views (GPDs) and their different parts (structure,
access, expand, format, and auto-links) by building a very small
