    In this two-part article, Arnold shows us how small is

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2369580.0x24613f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This column briefly describes
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Plan 9 From Bell Labs</em></span>, an operating system
done by the original group at Bell Labs that did Unix. We will be
focusing on the user interface part of Plan 9. It is interesting,
since the major components are either freely available from
AT&amp;T, or have been cloned in freely available software. The
article will be concluded next month.
</p><p>In the late 1980's, the research group at Bell Labs started
to feel that Unix had reached the end of its useful life as a
research vehicle. They decided that it was time to start over,
taking the useful lessons learned from Unix, and going on from
there. A brand new operating system was developed, named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Plan 9 From Bell Labs</em></span>.</p><p>The result is documented in two sets of papers. The early
papers discuss the overall design of Plan 9, its shell, compiler,
and window system. The later set contains additional papers about
the system and the entire reference manual for the system. What is
really neat is that PostScript for all of this is available via
anonymous ftp (see the sidebar). The reference manual is huge, over
650 pages; it helps to print it on a duplexing printer, if you have
one available. A mailing list of Plan 9 licensees and other folks
who are interested in Plan 9 is also available.</p><p>Plan 9 is a distributed system. It consists of three
components: File servers, where all the user files live; CPU
servers, where computing intensive tasks are done; and terminals,
which handle the user interface. The compute and file servers are
large machines that live in a machine room. At Bell Labs, they are
connected by a high-speed fiber network, although the software does
not require this. The terminals are small computers with mice,
keyboards, bitmapped displays, and network connections to the file
and compute servers. Terminals may have local disk drives for
performance reasons, but they are used for caching files and are
not strictly necessary.</p><p>Plan 9 is also a heterogeneous system. The operating system
has been ported to the MIPS, Motorola 680x0, Intel 80386/486, and
Sun SPARC architectures. At Bell Labs, they tend to use the MIPS
systems for their servers and the other systems for the terminals,
but again, that is not built in to the software.</p><p>Plan 9 also has a number of nice innovations in the software
architecture seen by the programmer. As a simple example of this,
in Unix, there are multiple system calls that affect the
meta-information about a file (owner, mode, etc) such as
<b  >chown</b>, <b  >chmod</b>, and
<b  >utime</b>. In Plan 9, there is only one,
<b  >wstat</b>, which writes the <b  >stat</b>
information about a file. As another example, all user and group
names are returned by the system as strings, the programmer never
has to manage the conversion between numeric user ids and strings.
There are many other very elegant improvements upon the Unix design
in Plan 9.</p><p>Plan 9 is also one of the first systems to use Unicode, a 16
bit character set. The <b  >sam</b> and
<b  >9term</b> programs discussed below also support
Unicode, making it possible, for example, to type a real smiley
character, instead of the usual three-character ASCII glyph.</p><p>(A parenthetical note on my soapbox. In many ways, Plan 9 is
a considerably superior design over Unix. It would be worthwhile
for those interested in a free version of Plan 9 to consider
starting from the Linux code base, using the device drivers, memory
management, and whatnot. Linux itself is and will remain a Unix
clone, and Unix is not Plan 9. Starting from Linux will be
particularly easy when Linux 2.0 comes out, as it will be
multi-platform, like Plan 9, or so I'm told.)</p><p>This should whet your appetite. Both the early and the
current Plan 9 papers are well worth reading. The manual is also
fun to browse.</p><p>Plan 9 is not (unfortunately) generally available.
Universities may license it from AT&amp;T for no cost (other than
time spent by the lawyer to review the license). Upon signing a
license, AT&amp;T sends one hard-copy of the manual and a CD-ROM.
The current (as of December 1994) release is almost two years old,
and the system has evolved somewhat. A new release, using PC based
hardware as the porting base, is in preparation, but no release
date is known yet. The AT&amp;T researchers are working towards a
way to release it more generally, but it will still require some
kind of license; it will not be freely available the way Linux,
NetBSD, or FreeBSD are.</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at the Plan 9 editor,
windowing system, and shell. They are important, because the editor
is freely available, and there are freely available clones of the
others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2369580.0x2461b88"></a>The sam Editor</h2></div></div><p>The Plan 9 editor is named <b  >sam</b>. (Some
history here. The original Unix editor was <b  >ed</b>.
It was command-driven. Rob Pike wrote a mouse-driven editor for the
Blit terminal named <b  >jim</b>. The successor to
<b  >jim</b> was <b  >sam</b>, also written by
Rob Pike. Basically, they're all a bunch of friendly, down to earth
sort of programs.... :-) (I'm told that <b  >sam</b> is
short for &ldquo;samantha&rdquo;, and female.)</p><p><b  >sam</b> is a multi-file, multi-window editor
that elegantly combines extended regular expressions
(<b  >egrep</b>-style) and the powerful
<b  >ed</b> command set with mouse driven text selection,
cutting, and pasting. In particular, all operations act upon the
selected text, which can include <span   class="emphasis"><em>multiple</em></span>
lines. Replacement text can include newline characters as
well.</p><p><b  >sam</b> also provides an infinite &ldquo;undo&rdquo;
capability, so you don't have to worry about making
mistakes.</p><p>One of the windows that sam provides you is the command
window, where you type in commands. What is nice is that, just like
the text in any other window, you can edit the text in the command
window, then select the edited line with the mouse, and send it
again as input. In other words, you can edit previous commands and
submit them for execution again. If a substitution didn't work or
do quite what you wanted it to do, undo the change, edit the
command, and try again. Do this as often as you like. Or, if you
used a series of commands on a chunk of text once, and need to do
that series again, select all the command lines, and send them all
at once. (The command window is similar to the mini-buffer in
Emacs.)</p><p>As an example, when replying to email, I'll often include the
original letter, preceded with &gt; signs. Sometimes I end up with
text that has only part of a line, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; So what
&gt; is your opinion about the future life of
&gt; systems like MVS, VMS, VM, and Solaris?
</pre><p>I can select these lines as a single group, and then reformat
it with the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
s/^&gt; //g
|fmt
s/^/&gt; /g
</pre><p>This removes the &gt; signs, runs the text through
<b  >fmt</b> to make it look nice, and then adds the &gt;
signs back in. The result might be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; So what is your opinion about the future life of systems
&gt;like MVS, VMS, VM, and Solaris?
</pre><p>(In fact, I was able to snarf the commands out of my article
text, paste them into the command window, edit them a bit, and then
submit them to make the new text above.)</p><p>The command language is particularly powerful, using a
notation called &ldquo;structural regular expressions&rdquo;. Essentially,
regular expressions can be cascaded together to select increasingly
more specific chunks of text upon which to operate. Here is an
example from the <b  >sam</b> paper. Suppose you wish to
change all occurrences of a variable n to now be called num. You
could use the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 , x/[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*/ g/n/ v/../ c/num/
</pre><p>The comma selects all lines (an abbreviation for 0 through
<b  >$</b>, the last line). The <b  >x</b>
command extracts text to operate upon. It is an iterator, meaning
that the command following it will be executed for each match of
the text. The sam paper explains the rest of the command: &ldquo;The
pattern <b  >[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*</b> matches C
identifiers. Next, <b  >g/n/</b> selects those containing
an n. Then <b  >v/../</b> rejects those containing two
(or more) characters, and finally <b  >c/num/</b> changes
the remainder (identifiers <b  >n</b>) to
<b  >num</b>.&rdquo; The <b  >g</b> and
<b  >v</b> commands are conditionals.
<b  >g</b> says execute the command only if the pattern
matches; <b  >v</b> is the opposite&mdash;execute the command
only if the pattern does not match.</p><p>Simple changes are often made with the mouse. But for
complex, sweeping changes, a command language such as the one in
<b  >sam</b> is essential. Indeed, this is why
<b  >vi</b> includes the <b  >ed</b> command
set as a subset.</p><p>As mentioned, sam is a multi-file editor. You can have
several files open in windows at once, and several windows on the
same file. This is particularly useful for cut and paste operations
when going from one file to the next. The command language also
provides commands for doing operations on all files that contain,
or do not contain, a particular regular expression.</p><p>To summarize why I find sam attractive:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It is multi-file and multi-window.</p></li><li><p>It has a powerful command language that makes many
editing operations easy.</p></li><li><p>It is possible to edit your commands.</p></li></ol></div><p>This last is particularly useful; it is one of those things
that once you have it, you can't believe you ever lived without
it.</p><p><b  >sam</b> is implemented on top of two
libraries. The <b  >libframe</b> library provides windows
(frames) of text. This library is implemented in turn on top of
libg, a graphics library. For Unix, the Plan 9
<b  >sam</b> and <b  >libframe</b> code is
used, essentially unchanged, on top of <b  >libXg</b>, an
implementation of <b  >libg</b> for X windows using the
Xt toolkit. All of this software supports Unicode. It is possible,
for example, to enter the 1/2 symbol by typing
<b  >ALT-1-2</b>.</p><p>See the sidebar for the <b  >ftp</b> location of
<b  >sam</b>; AT&amp;T has graciously made it available
free of any licensing worries. There is also a mailing list for
<b  >sam</b> users.</p><p>The mailing list archive includes a <b  >sam</b>
emulator for Emacs, written by Rick Sladkey
(<a href="mailto:jrs@world.std.com">jrs@world.std.com</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2369580.0x2459c28"></a>The 9term Terminal Emulator</h2></div></div><p>The Plan 9 windowing system is called 81/2, since it was the
Eight and a half'th windowing system that Rob Pike had written. To
create a new window, you select <b  >New</b> from the
right button menu, and sweep out the window you want. That window
then runs a shell (<b  >rc</b>, discussed below).</p><p>What is unusual about the windows in 81/2 is that you can
edit the text directly in the window. Thus, if you make a typing
error in a command, you fix the error, select the entire line, and
resubmit it. This obsoletes the need for built-in command history
as found in current Unix shells, such as <b  >ksh</b>,
<b  >bash</b> and <b  >tcsh</b>.</p><p>Furthermore, windows provide more complicated text editing
capabilities. By pressing the ESCAPE key, the window goes into
&ldquo;hold mode&rdquo;. All text is kept in the window. It is not sent to the
program running in the window until the ESCAPE key is hit again,
leaving hold mode. Hold mode is indicated by an extra white border
inside the window, and a larger, white arrow for the mouse
cursor.</p><p>You might use this, for example, when sending mail to
someone. Run the <b  >Mail</b> command, and then go into
hold mode. Type in, edit, and rearrange your letter to your hearts
content. Then leave hold mode, and out goes your mail to the
<b  >Mail</b> program.</p><p>Finally, by default, 81/2 windows do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
scroll. Instead, text just buffers up inside them until you are
ready to look at it. The down-arrow key on the keyboard allows you
to quickly move through the buffered text. You can use the button 2
menu to change the behavior of the window so that it does scroll.
The non-scrolling mode is a feature; it obviates the need for pager
programs like <b  >more</b>, <b  >pg</b>, and
<b  >less</b>.</p><p>The Unix program that emulates 81/2 windows is called
<b  >9term</b>. <b  >9term</b> was written by
Matty Farrow, at the University of Sydney, in Australia. It adds an
additional library, <b  >libtext</b>, on top of
<b  >libframe</b> and <b  >libXg</b>.
<b  >9term</b> is both small and fast. On a Sun
SPARCstation LX, <b  >9term</b> starts almost instantly,
while an xterm can take several seconds to start up, noticeably
longer.</p><p>Besides hold mode described above, <b  >9term</b>
provides cut and paste editing and the ability to search backwards
or forwards in the window for a particular piece of text (whatever
is currently selected). <b  >9term</b> also uses the
up-arrow key to allow you to go backwards in the window, something
that must be done with the mouse in 81/2.</p><p>The <b  >9term</b> interface is consciously similar
to that of <b  >sam</b>. Button 1 in both programs
selects text, button 2 supplies the editing menu, and button 3
provides the control menu. Double-clicking button 1 at the end of a
line selects the whole line, and double-clicking in the middle of a
word selects the word. Finally, in both programs, menus &ldquo;remember&rdquo;
the last command issued. Thus, the next time you call up a menu,
the default action is to do what you did last time, which is often
what you want to do.</p><p>Having the identical interface makes using your system much
easier; you don't have to mentally &ldquo;switch gears&rdquo; when moving from
one window to the next: your mouse and keyboard work the same way,
no matter what.</p><p><b  >9term</b> is fast because it is simple. Unlike
<b  >xterm</b>, it is not emulating a real terminal (or
two or three), trying to interpret and process escape sequences.
This means, for example, that you can't run <b  >vi</b>
or <b  >emacs</b> inside a <b  >9term</b>
window. On the other hand, why would you want to?
<b  >sam</b> is considerably more powerful than
<b  >vi</b>, and much easier to learn than
<b  >Emacs</b>. My intent is not to start Yet Another
Religious Editor War. Rather, the philosophy is that
<b  >9term</b> doesn't have to be complicated to support
screen editors, since a powerful editor, <b  >sam</b>, is
already available.</p><p>In the same directory as the <b  >9term</b>
distribution there is a tar file with a large set of Unicode fonts
for use with X. I particularly like the
<b  >pelm.latin1.9</b> font.</p><p>The <a href="1012s1.html" target="_self">sidebar</a> describes where
to get 9term and the Unicode fonts.</p><p>In next month's conclusion, we'll discuss the shells to run
inside <b  >9term</b>, and the <b  >9wm</b>
window manager that completes the 81/2 emulation.</p></div></div>
