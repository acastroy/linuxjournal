    Linux has several convenient strong points when working with
    non-standard hardware. Freely available source code allowed
    Grant Edwards to compete a project much more easily than he
    would have been able to without Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11eb348"></a></h2></div></div><p>A year ago I installed Linux at home on
my 386-20 and fired up X11 on my Hercules monochrome graphics
adapter. I edited a source file with GNU emacs and compiled it with
gcc. A real &ldquo;Unix&rdquo; system at home! I was so thrilled I walked
around grinning for days. &ldquo;This is so cool!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;That's
nice, but what do you do with it?&rdquo; was the reply. I didn't have
much of an answer then&mdash;but I do now.
</p><p>This article describes a real world Linux application. The
requirement was for an unattended computer to gather data from
three different fluid level measurement devices and relay that data
to a remote location.</p><p>The site is a coal-fired power plant about 100km away from
the computer. The three measurement devices are mounted on an
upright cylindrical tank with a height and diameter of
approximately 7m. The tank holds water which will be mixed with ash
to produce a slurry that is easier to handle than dry ash. There is
120VAC power at the tank, but no telephone line. The environment is
benign, other than the constant presence of a powder-fine dust that
resembles a cross between Portland cement and cake flour.</p><p>The measurement devices all use different serial protocols
and physical layers. Two protocols use printable ASCII with each
frame terminated by CR/LF. The first of these (ASCII Modbus)
resembles Intel hex records on an RS-232 physical layer. The second
is a proprietary command interface that utilizes shell-like
commands over an RS-485 physical layer.</p><p>The third protocol (RTU Modbus) consists of binary data with
the end-of-frame marked by a gap larger than 3 byte times. The
physical layer is half-duplex FSK. The interface to the computer is
an RS-232 port connected to a proprietary FSK modem.</p><p>The hardware selected for the system is a rack-mounted,
industrial 486 machine with 16M of RAM and a 500M IDE disk drive.
The industrial PC chosen has several features useful for unattended
operation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ability to boot without a keyboard.</p></li><li><p>Ability to boot without a video board.</p></li><li><p>A hardware watchdog timer that can reset the
computer in case of system lockup.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since no phone line was available to provide communications
between the data gathering system and the central host, a cellular
phone was used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11eb8c8"></a>Additional Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Cellular communication&mdash;all you need is money.</p><p>For this task I purchased a pair of Microcom DeskPort 14.4K
modems that support the MNP-10 &ldquo;cellular&rdquo; feature set. Cellular
telephone connections vary much more in quality from minute to
minute than do land lines, and drop-outs are more frequent and
longer. For reliable cellular communications, modems need the
ability to re-equalize and adjust baud rates and packet sizes
accordingly. With the MNP-10 features disabled, I was unable to
maintain a reliable connection even at 300 and 600 baud. With the
error correction enabled, the connection was usually maintained at
9.6K or 12K baud.</p><p>UUCP was chosen over SLIP due to UUCP's ability to queue work
and to automatically redial and restart a transfer after a call is
dropped.</p><p>The cellular telephone is a Motorola &ldquo;Bag&rdquo; style 3-watt
cellular which was on hand and available for use. A &ldquo;cellular
connection&rdquo; box had to be purchased for the phone. The cellular
connection is a black box, about the size of a pack of cigarettes,
that plugs between the handset and the radio. It provides an RJ-11
jack, generates dial tone, responds to the modem's switch-hook
transitions and converts DTMF tones to handset key presses.</p><p>Since one of the ASCII interfaces runs on the RS-485 physical
layer, a board from Opto-22 was chosen that had a standard 16450
UART with opto-isolated RS-485 drivers and receivers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ebb30"></a>System Software</h2></div></div><p>The system required unattended, remote operation and
simultaneous communication on four serial ports. While all of this
would be possible under MS-DOS it would require a significant
amount of effort, while a Unix-type OS would support all of them
right &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;.</p><p>Copies of Coherent and ISC SVr2 were available for use, but I
chose Linux for two reasons. First, I was (and still am) running
Linux at home. More importantly, Linux source code was available in
case something needed to be customized or fixed.</p><p>A borrowed Fall 1993 Yggdrasil CD provided the base system,
although uucp and mail didn't work as installed. I downloaded new
copies of smail and Taylor UUCP, and they installed and configured
with no problems. getty-ps was installed to allow the modem to be
used both as a dial-out device by uucp and as a dial-in device for
remote logins.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ebce8"></a>Application Software</h2></div></div><p>The first job was a watchdog timer daemon. The watchdog
daemon needed to do an I/O port write periodically to reset the
hardware watchdog timer. In order to provide for orderly system
shutdown, when the watchdog timer daemon receives a term signal, it
disables the timer. Since the port address was above 0x400 the
<b  >ioperm()</b> and <b  >_outb()</b> system
calls wouldn't work.</p><p>(The kernel only maintains permission maps for ports below
0x400.) Instead, the daemon does an <b  >open()</b> on
/dev/port and uses the <b  >lseek()</b> and
<b  >write()</b> system calls to do the port I/O. Since
the I/O is small and infrequent, the system call overhead isn't a
problem.</p><p>The next job was the software that gathers data via the three
serial ports. Should it be a single, large program that talks to
all three devices? This would be needlessly complex compared to
writing three separate programs, each of which talks to a single
device. This is especially true, since the three devices all used
different protocols and provided different sets of data.</p><p>Each of the three programs gathers data (one sample every
five seconds) and writes a line of text on stdout for each sample.
Each line of output includes time stamp, status and data values.
Each program has a command line option that specifies how long to
gather data before terminating.</p><p>A simple ASCII output format with whitespace-separated
columns allows easy manipulation and data reduction using familiar
Unix tools, such as awk and gnuplot. A few lines of one of the data
files is shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
94-01-28 18:52:41 OK 0 4.745400 998.4952
94-01-28 18:52:47 OK 0 4.745406 998.4937
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ec160"></a>Half Duplex Communication</h2></div></div><p>It's like a cheap speaker phone&mdash;only one end can talk at a
time.</p><p>The only unusual problem associated with the data gathering
programs was the use of a half-duplex FSK modem. RTS must be
asserted when the Linux host sending a command and then dropped to
allow the device to respond. This can't be done easily from user
level software, so the serial port driver was modified. Two lines
of code were added to the driver so that it asserts RTS at the
beginning of a transmission and drops it at the end. You don't
often need source to the OS, but in this case, it saved a large
amount of extra effort that would have been required to add custom
hardware to control RTS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ec2c0"></a>Running the Show</h2></div></div><p>Once the individual data acquisition programs were debugged,
something was needed to execute the individual programs and
coordinate the whole process. On Unix systems, that means a shell
script: nothing complicated, just an infinite loop that does the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>start each of the three data acquisition programs
in the background with a command line switch set to run for six
hours and with stdout redirected into a file.</p></li><li><p>wait for all three of the above to
terminate.</p></li><li><p>compress the data files and uucp them to the
destination.</p></li></ul></div><p>This shellscript is started in the background by an entry in
/etc/rc.local and runs forever shipping data files off four times a
day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ec688"></a>Glitches and Problems</h2></div></div><p>It all sounds quite smooth after the fact, but the project
was not without its little hiccups. The most embarrassing problem
occurred while attempting to reboot the system remotely. I typed
<b  >shutdown -fh</b> instead of <b  >shutdown
-fr</b> so the system halted rather than rebooting. The
system was down for a week before a trip could be made to the site
to push the reset button.</p><p>The dial-in/dial-out port connected to the cellular modem
would occasionally be permanently locked by
<b  >getty</b>. This prevented uucp from dialing out to
transfer data. A crontab entry was added to periodically kill the
getty on that port. There were two other instances where all
communications were lost. After some experimentation, I determined
that the cellular telephone had somehow been powered off.</p><p>Perusal of the user's manual and a call to the service
provider revealed that the cellular phone shuts itself off if not
used for eight hours. This happened twice&mdash;apparently the cellular
connection doesn't always detect the modem off-hook condition, and
this resulted in the cellular telephone turning itself off after
eight hours of inactivity. UUCP should have retried several times
before the eight hour timeout, so the exact sequence of events is
still a bit of a mystery. The immediate solution was to configure a
uucp crontab entry to make sure it will &ldquo;phone home&rdquo; once an hour
even if there is not any work to be done. The eight hour timeout
can be disabled and this will be done when it is convenient to take
the phone in to the shop.</p><p>On a more mundane note, I managed to break my shared
libraries the first time I attempted to upgrade them in order to
run a newer version of the &ldquo;man&rdquo; utility. It was a simple task to
boot using the bootdisk/CD-ROM and fix the libraries to the point
where the system would again boot from the IDE drive. (When you
upgrade your shared libraries, read the directions twice before you
start and follow them <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span>.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f3580.0x11ec9f8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The project was an unqualified success and similar Linux
configurations are being considered for other test sites in the
future.</p></div></div>
