    A commercial product for Linux survives trial by fire.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebe580.0xfb63f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In many ways, I am a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; user.
Backing up is a pain. Necessary, but still a pain. I'm also used to
getting burned by bad tapes and utilities that just don't seem to
be very robust (such as tar, or a few other commercial items that
will remain unnamed).
</p><p>I saw the ad for BRU on page 39 of the January `95
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I had seen it in other
magazines, and heard it once highly recommended by a former
business associate. With this as a background, and having a spare
$97, I decided it was worth a try. Besides, they offer a 60 day
risk-free guarantee. I faxed them an order, not realizing how soon
I was going to need BRU.</p><p>Ted Cook called me the next day (my fax went out late in the
evening). He asked what my kernel version was, if I was running
Slackware and had <b  >pkgtool</b>, if I wanted the
pkgtool version or the tar version, and what disk size I needed. I
opted for the <b  >pkgtool</b> version on 3-1/2" disks.
BRU, along with a nifty mug (which you can keep even if you decide
not to keep BRU) arrived 2 days later.</p><p>The package comes on a single 1.44MB floppy with a nicely
done spiral-bound manual, plus an addendum sheet outlining the
install process for Linux. Installation using pkgtool is quick and
painless.</p><p>Once installed, you must edit /etc/brutab to define your
backup devices to BRU. The file is well commented, and the process
is outlined in detail in the manual. I did this, defining my
Tandberg 3600 drive. There is also a file /etc/bruxpat that
contains patterns of files to be excluded from backups, such as
/tmp/*, /proc/*, etc., as well as what files should not be
compressed if you are using BRU's built in compression, such as .Z
or .gz files. The use of this file is optional.</p><p>Here in /etc/brutab I found what I consider to be a flaw with
the way BRU is shipped. There is an entry for <b  >OVERWRITE
PROTECT</b>, which is turned on, but it relies on the value
of <b  >RECYCLEDAYS</b>, which is set to zero,
effectively disabling the protection afforded. As I will relate,
this turned into a painful &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; for me. Having plenty of tapes
and a fairly regular backup schedule, I set
<b  >RECYCLEDAYS</b> to 7. There are many other options
that can be set in /etc/brutab, most of which can be left alone, or
omitted for default values.</p><p>I suppose the best way to test a backup product is to backup
a system, and then wipe it clean. This is not what I intended to
do, but it is effectively what I ended up doing. I ran a backup
using BRU the day I received it. Three days later, I ran another
backup, went to work, and came home to a failed hard drive. Ugh!
Thanks to a good friend, I was able to get a loaner drive the same
evening. I booted with my Slackware disks (1.1.2&mdash;old, I know, but
that's what I'm running...), partitioned and formatted the new
drive, and installed only the required packages from the A disk
set. I then installed BRU, edited /etc/brutab to define my tape
drive, loaded up my tape, and started the restore&mdash;or so I thought.
What actually happened is that my fingers got dyslexic on me, and
instead of telling BRU to extract from the tape, I told it to
backup to the tape... This is where the default setting of
<b  >RECYCLEDAYS=0</b> got me. Had it been anything else,
or had I remembered to change it back to 7, I would not have
overwritten my latest backup tape. (This should no longer be an
issue, since EST, Inc. has changed the installation script to
update these variables automatically during the installation, as it
automatically creates /etc/brutab according to the installer's
preferences.)</p><p>After thoroughly cussing myself out, kicking the wall, and
muttering into thin air for a while, I changed</p><p><b  >RECYCLEDAYS</b> to 7, write protected the
first tape I had made three days prior, and did the restore. Once
complete, I did a reboot, and the system came up perfectly.</p><p>I then decided to test BRU's claims of reliability. Sitting
back in the corner I have this tape with BAD written all over it.
It first failed during a server backup at work (a whole different
story about commercial software that doesn't work), so I brought it
home, where it worked for a while. Very soon, this tape started
always giving me errors. It would almost always appear to write
properly, but would fail very shortly into any read operation with
media I/O errors. I popped this tape into the drive and changed to
/usr/bin and did a backup (BRU stores absolute pathnames only if
you explicitly tell it to, otherwise stores everything relative to
./).</p><p>BRU complained.</p><p>BRU complained again during the &ldquo;AUTOSCAN&rdquo; pass.</p><p>I created a junk directory, changed to there, and did a
restore.</p><p>BRU complained.</p><p>BRU warned me about my junk media.</p><p>BRU restored every single file on the tape.</p><p>I don't recommend using bad media for backups, but BRU did
prove to me that it really does have the &ldquo;GUTS&rdquo; it talks about in
the advertisements.</p><p>Since then, I've installed an Exabyte 8200 8mm tape drive,
and do almost all of my backups there. With &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; tuning
as far as buffers go, I get about 240Kbs throughput writing to the
tape. The AUTOSCAN feature is very nice, because it will warn you
about media errors before you put your tape on the shelf thinking
your data is secure. BRU also includes scripts for doing full and
incremental (with up to 9 levels) backups. There are no
menus&mdash;everything is driven from the command line. Hey&mdash;I'm not
running Windoze here... My backup regime now consists of</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /;bru -cvvvXf /dev/rmt1
</pre><p>Twenty minutes or so later, I come back and check, confident
that AUTOSCAN will warn me of any problems encountered.</p><p>BRU has many, many options, most of which I have not even
begun to look at. I like it. It's reliable. It fills a definite
need. If you'd like more information, call Ted Cook at Enhanced
Software Technologies, Inc., (800) 998-8649 or (602) 820-0042. Tell
him I sent you.</p><p>About system: 80486DX/33, 20MB RAM, 1.2GB SCSI Disk, Tandberg
