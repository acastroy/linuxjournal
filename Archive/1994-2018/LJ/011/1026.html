    &ldquo;Linux does endless loops in six seconds&rdquo; and other amazing
    comments were overheard at the First Dutch International
    Symposium on Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xac6580.0xbbe3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In December, when I would otherwise have
been preparing for this issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, I spent a week in Amsterdam attending the First
Dutch International Symposium on Linux. Linus, Remy Card, Matt
Welsh, and several others spoke on a large variety of topics. I
will mention here only a sampling of the presentations that were
made.
</p><p>By any measure, the Symposium was a success. Originally
arranged to be held in an 80-person room, the symposium was moved
to a 120-person room, and the organizers were still forced to turn
people away. While many of the participants were Dutch, I believe
that the majority were foreign. With participants from all over
Europe and North America, and at least one participant from Japan,
it was a truly international symposium.</p><p>Many of the participants in the symposium had never before
met in person, but knew each other well through e-mail and usenet
news exchanges. It is an interesting phenomenon to need to be
introduced to a person you feel like you know well.</p><p>The Dutch are precise people. Their trains run on time, their
museums close on time, and their conferences run strictly according
to schedule. Each talk started on time. Five minutes from the
scheduled end of each speaker's allotted time slot, a kitchen timer
rang. Then at the end, five minutes later, it would ring again, and
the speaker was allowed (in practice if not in theory) to finish
his sentence. This second ring was called <b  >kill
-9</b> by the conference organizers.</p><p>Matt Welsh gave the best exposition I have heard yet on how
to port to Linux. Not satisfied with the standard answer that most
(portable) programs written for POSIX, SVR4, SVR3, or BSD just
compile (given the right compiler flags for BSD programs), he
explained what kinds of non-portable code can and will cause
problems and suggested ways for the listener to either get around
the problem or let the listener know that the problem would take
significant effort to code around.</p><p><a href="1026f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Matt Welsh,
Schilpol Airport in Amsterdam</b></span></a></p><p>Remy Card gave a technical introduction to the Second
Extended Filesystem, showing that there is room for further
development of the filesystem built into the filesystem, so that as
extra capabilities are added, people do not have to reformat their
hard drives. He also explained some of the features that make it
less susceptible to corruption than other filesystems.</p><p>I gave a talk on how I see <i  >Linux Journal</i> affecting the Linux
market, both in terms of available software and available jobs, and
spent some time discussing <i  >Linux Journal</i> in a question and answer
session that was sort of like letters to the editor, only
faster.</p><p>Michael Kraehe gave a presentation on Onyx, his Copylefted
4GL which he developed (and sells support for) under Linux. It can
tie together many different kinds of databases (Informix, Ingres,
Postgres, Yard, gawk, Shql, and others) with one data presentation.
The 4GL language is more like a shell than other 4GLs, because
system commands can be used; a report to print your bills could
send the output of a command through a &ldquo;gawk | groff | lpr&rdquo;
pipeline. It uses the standard Unix tools instead of replacing
them.</p><p>Peter Braam, of Oxford, gave an explanation of how Linux is
being distributed all around the very distributed Oxford campus
without seriously compromising security, and without requiring
students to become their own systems administrators on their own
Linux machines, by using Kerberos for network authorization and SUP
(Software Update Protocol, from CMU) for updating packages on
students' drives.</p><p>A team designing a product called Viper, which is a spin-off
of Linux which will provide full kernel threads in a package
conforming to POSIX 1003.4a, presented the work that they have done
so far and explained what is left to do.</p><p>Linus Torvalds (the originator, main guru, and &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; of
the Linux project, for those new to Linux) gave two talks. The
first, which opened the conference, was an introduction to Linux.
The second closed the conference, was much more technical, and
generated more questions. Linus kindly asked to be interrupted
whenever anyone had a question, and the technical talk generated
more interrupts than the overview.</p><p>He gave an interesting example of how freedom to re-think
some assumptions that were made when the original Unix was written
allowed a simpler design in Linux. In other versions of Unix,
&ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; creates a race condition that can cause processes to go
to sleep forever, unless interrupts are carefully disabled while
going to sleep. Linux uses a slightly different paradigm than most
unices (sleeping is done in two steps, first saying, &ldquo;I'm asleep
now&rdquo; and then later actually going to sleep) which removes the
possibility of the race condition without disabling interrupts,
improving both performance and robustness.</p><p>Linus told us about several efforts underway, including his
ongoing 64-bit port to the DEC Alpha. That port is still in its
infancy, but is important in helping make the entire kernel more
portable, because it uses 64-bit pointers (and 64-bit integers by
default), which exposes non-portable code very effectively. Work is
being done now to integrate the work being done on several ports
into the mainline source tree, towards the goal of making Linux a
true multi-platform operating system. &ldquo;I'll make a [version] 2.0
someday, and the decision when to go to 2.0 is essentially when I
have a stable release which is multi-platform,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Other quotes from Linus were both interesting and (usually)
informative. I have included a sampling both of non-technical and
technical quotes:</p><p>&ldquo;While in Australia, Dennis Ritchie said that the one feature
of Unix he was most proud of was that it was portable. When it
comes to Linux, the one decision I am most proud of is not the
actual physical design of the system, but the decision to make it
free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The most important design issue...is the fact that Linux is
supposed to be fun....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Linux is a Unix clone for PC clones. The `PC clones' part
I'm trying to fix, and others are trying to fix it as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[Linux] does endless loops in six seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'd [really like to] see Word for Windows under
Linux....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;....So, I obviously decided to make my own Unix. What do I
need? I need lots of ignorance, because if you know too much, you
know that it's obviously impossible. Then you need the
arrogance&mdash;`yes, I can do it, and I can do it better than anybody
else'. Those two you need to just get started... you need to be a
bit crazy and actually go on with it...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Somebody from Novell commented that they had an
alpha-testing lab of a hundred machines or so, and he said, `No
wonder Linux works so well. He has an alpha-testing lab of ten
thousand people!'&mdash;and that's true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ext2 is much better than the Minix filesystem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a general move [to] getting kernel threads
eventually, which could be the Viper threads, or could not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Within, maybe, half a year, a year, I expect to see three
reasonably supported different platforms for Linux. The 386 version
will be the normal one, though, simply because everybody has
one.&rdquo;</p><p>Speaking of an improvement that may debut with 1.3.x: &ldquo;The
improved data cache essentially means that the data cache right now
is indexed according to the device and block number on the
device... In the long run, we want to make this indexed according
to the inode and the offset of the inode, which makes it much
easier for the VFS layer to look up a buffer, without the need to
go through the low-level filesystem to find out the block number.
It also makes it possible to do NFS caching (read caching, because
write caching [NFS] is a no-no).&rdquo;</p><p><a href="1026f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds,
