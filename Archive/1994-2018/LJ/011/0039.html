This stands
for Frequently Asked Questions, and they are posted regularly to
help decrease the traffic. This book, subtitled The FAQs of Life
Online, is a compilation of these FAQs put into a 550 page
book.</p><p>The book gets off to a good start by presenting the
introduction in a FAQ format. First question: What does FAQ mean?
And the second is: Does the world need another Internet book? The
answer to this second question will help you understand why Kevin
wrote the book. He explains how there are a lot of new Internet
books and many, if not most, try to be a 1000 page guide that tells
you everything you need to know about the Internet. Then he tells
you the world doesn't need another one of those books. I have to
agree if, for no other reason than, you really need to learn the
basics; then start exploring, rather than reading another
book.</p><p>But this book is different. It really doesn't offer anything
you can't get on the Internet, but it does offer it on paper. FAQs
exist because this is information people need to know. Some of it
is on the mechanics of using the Internet but much of it is on how
to find information and what information can be found.</p><p>Some questions are answered with a specific answer, others
with the illustrated use of an Internet tool to find the answer.
For example, the question, &ldquo;Where can I find software for my Atari
computer?&rdquo; is answered with the name of two Usenet newsgroups, the
name of two archive sites, a gopher site and a mail server.</p><p>Chapters include &ldquo;Can I Do Business on the Internet?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is
There Government Information Online?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What Do I Need to Know
About Internet Culture and Lore?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where Are All the Fun and
Games?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is This Book Worth Buying?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How Can I Find and Use
Software (and Other Stuff)?&rdquo;. The appendices include a list of
&ldquo;Internet Access Providers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Information About the Internet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Internet Offline&rdquo;.</p><p>Besides the normal table of contents, there is a Question
Reference and an Index. This combination makes it extremely easy to
locate the questions for which you are looking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1561580.0x1659b88"></a>Is This Book Worth Purchasing?</h2></div></div><p>It depends on your situation. By that I mean, if you are
always connected to the net and enjoy looking for everything
online, you may not need this book. On the other hand, if you pay
by the hour for your Internet connection or you occasionally like
to find something on paper first, this book is a great
resource.</p><p>For example, I read the book so I could write the review on
an airplane between Washington State and Washington, DC. Clearly
the $25 cover price of the book was a lot lower than the cost of
plugging my laptop computer into the AirPhone, at multi-dollars per
minute, in order to look up information on the Internet.</p><p>The biggest downside of the book is the fact that information
continually changes on the Internet. This means that some of the
information is out of date the day the book is printed. However,
there is enough stable information that the book will offer lots of
answers a year or two after it is printed.</p></div></div>
