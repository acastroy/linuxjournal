    Once again, it is time to present our annual awards to those
    we feel deserve recognition for their contributions to
    forwarding the Linux cause in the real world.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3730f10.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d1580.0x23c9710"></a></h2></div></div><p> Welcome to the 1999 Editors' Choice
Awards, brought to you by the same cool cats who bring you
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. This has been an extremely
exciting year for the world of Linux in all areas. We have
witnessed an explosion in many areas, and the spirit of open source
is stronger than ever throughout the entire community. Last year
Netscape brought open source to the masses, and we are stronger now
in numbers and spirit. This year saw major improvements to the
various distributions, a wildly successful IPO, and more attention
from the business world and software firms than for other
platforms, not to mention the successes of the kernel developers
and the proliferation and growth of projects. As for the Editors'
Choice Awards, there were many qualified candidates, and while
sometimes the winners were obvious, other times we had to choose
the best among peers. Here are our choices, we hope you agree with
most (or at least some) of them!

Product of the Year: Caldera Linux 2.3 for LIZARD
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Caldera with some help from TrollTech has finally delivered
what Linux users and Linux critics have been asking for&mdash;easy Linux
installation. Not only does LIZARD (LInux wiZARD) make a complete
installation with an easy-to-use graphical interface, it
automatically probes hardware and installs while you are making
configuration decisions about the system. Recent major improvements
include automatic detection and support for sound cards, as well as
releasing LIZARD as open source under the QPL. LIZARD makes Linux
installation practically automatic, setting a new standard across
the Linux world. Now Linux is more accessible than ever. And, the
Caldera figures who come on during installation are so exciting, we
in editorial have been known to install Caldera over and over again
on the same machine just to watch what we call &ldquo;the Ransom
dance&rdquo;. Thank you Caldera and TrollTech.</p><p>

Best New Hardware: VA Linux Systems ClusterCity &amp; VACM
</p></div></div>
</p><p>VA Linux Systems has developed the most advanced Linux
Beowulf cluster and requisite management software. ClusterCity is
the name of the system, and VACM (pronounced &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo;) is the
management software released under the GPL. Not only is the cluster
convenient and flexible (rack mounted with easy access to
components, as opposed to many clusters which are dozens of desktop
boxes stuck together consuming a lot of space), the VACM software
represents a major leap forward in cluster management technology.
ClusterCity and VACM are to be formally unveiled at SuperComputing
1999. One outstanding (and rather &ldquo;modern&rdquo;) feature is that VACM
allows <span   class="emphasis"><em>complete</em></span> remote access to everything,
including the BIOS configuration, RAID control, power, system
diagnosis, as well as the usual cluster management activities. As
Linux storms the server world and marches across the desktop, VA is
leading the charge into commercial supercomputing. ClusterCity is
already in use by numerous scientific and Internet
organizations.</p><p>

Best New Application&mdash;Software Development: BXPro &amp; Code Fusion
</p></div></div>
</p><p>This award goes jointly to ICS's BXPro (Builder Xcessory Pro)
and Cygnus Code Fusion for their cooperative effort to coordinate
their two development products to provide what is essentially the
first Visual
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3730f3.jpg"></div>
 C/C++ equivalent for Linux. BXPro and Code Fusion are distribution
independent, the former being a fast GUI builder and the latter
being a complete C/C++/Java IDE which mostly cooperates with the
open-source world of Makefiles. Flexibility and cooperation deserve
recognition and help to make top-of-the-line software even better.
In fact, one of the rare good qualities of MS products is that they
cooperate well with each other (though they tend to be most
disagreeable with everything else), so let's see if we can win here
too. Even though many are opposed in principle to commercial
software, these products set an example for open-source coders&mdash;if
successful, these products could become models for future projects.
In the meantime, let's see what software gets written with these
excellent development applications.</p><p>

Best New Application&mdash;Embedded Systems: Lineo Embedix
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Lineo, which recently branched off from Caldera, has
delivered Embedix, an embedded Linux OS based on Caldera OpenLinux.
Contrary to the trend of making enormous distributions with more
packages than the competitors, Lineo concentrates on packing more
Linux into smaller packages. The modular kernel is designed for
OEMs to have an easy time adding the software they need, and Lineo
provides EmbedixSDK as an embedded software development platform
for writing and testing software before embedding it. Currently,
Lineo and Caldera are working with Motorola, with others to come in
the near future. Embedded systems are going to be a major frontier,
and one might speculate how far embedded Linux will go? Could it
become even more successful as an embedded product than as a
desktop OS? Very likely, exciting times are ahead. Check out our
October 1999 issue for an interview with Lineo's Lyle Ball (hint:
it's the issue with Lyle Ball on the cover with a Motorola
box).</p><p>

Best New Application&mdash;End User: Loki's Civilization: Call to Power
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Congratulations to Loki Entertainment for its excellent port
of the current incarnation of what is probably the ultimate
world-domination game. Civilization is the first commercially
available, high-quality Linux game (with possible exceptions
depending on your point of view), which hopefully will usher in a
new era in Linux&mdash;the proliferation of games. Nothing makes a
better &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; than a killer game. Loki has already
delivered more ports of top-quality games, including Myth II and
Railroad Tycoon and is at work on Heavy Gear II and Heretic II.
<i  >Linux Journal</i> interviewed Scott Draeker
(founder of Loki) and Sam Latinga (lead programmer) in the August
1999 issue. &ldquo;Civilized gentlemen&rdquo; was the verdict.</p><p>

Best New Gadget: Empeg Embedded MP3 Player
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Empeg Ltd. of the UK has developed an mpeg player for your
car, embedded with Linux. Why Linux? Because they &ldquo;like it a lot,
and worship Linus on a daily basis at our own personal shrine,&rdquo;
says their tech page. Empeg uses a StrongARM processor and a big
hard drive and has a toolkit for Linux and an interface so that
Windows users can load their favorite mpegs (depending on the
model, up to 500 albums) into the player. Linux hackers, we're
sure, can figure out what else to do with it. The system features
18-bit DACs, 5-band EQ for each of the 4 channels, an FM radio,
bass, treble, loudness, balance and fader controls, and gold-plated
connectors, among other things. Although the Windows interface is
more full featured than for Linux, the developers use the Linux
interface. Empeg proves the viability of Linux in small, embedded
gadgetry.</p><p>

Best New Book: <span  class="emphasis"><em>Open Sources: Voices of a New
Revolution</em></span>
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Open source is the revolution, a movement which could
restructure and reshape the digital-information age the way the
1960s revamped Western society. Despite its occasional factual
inaccuracies (which have a charm all their own), this book collects
several essays from the important figures at the head of the
GNU/Linux Open Source scene. Although many excellent technical
manuals were introduced this year, a comprehensive collection of
open-source insights and philosophy means more to the community at
large than any one, single technical manual. We are in the midst of
a revolution, a period in the history of computers which hopefully
we can appreciate before it is over and we look back on it. Open
Source is a movement which runs much deeper than many of us
appreciate, encompassing those who are concerned with the
capability of producing high-quality, powerful software, and those
who uphold freedom, community and principles as the core of the
philosophy. This book helps us to appreciate the true meaning of
our movement.</p><p>

Best Business Solution: Burlington Coat Factory
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Inspired by summer interns who wanted Linux on their
workstations, Burlington Coat Factory installed 1,250 Linux
machines from Dell in its 264 stores. In spite of popular
allegations that Linux is unsupported and has no software, Red Hat
is providing the Red Hat Linux distribution and technical support,
while Applixware is providing the business software and additional
support. Burlington Coat Factory CIO Mike Prince has long been
known for his ability to pick up on technologies early; his track
record includes adopting UNIX and Java long before everyone else,
for example. Once again, Linux is proving itself in an extremely
successful company, with Red Hat and Applixware showing that Linux
firms are enthusiastic to provide software and support. More people
may come to embrace Linux not only as a moral alternative to
proprietary software but as a practical business solution, viable
even for businesses that aren't high-powered computing firms
crawling with engineers.</p></div></div>
