    A look into VPNs&mdash;what they are and how they work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2640500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Commercial Virtual Private Network (VPN)
products are becoming widespread. They let confidential data safely
take the &ldquo;free ride&rdquo; offered by the Internet, compensating for
the Net's intrinsic lack of security. A Linux VPN can be
constructed several ways. One is outlined in the clever but spare
VPN mini-HOWTO by Arpad Magosanyi. I implemented it for a business
and present some of the insights gained.
</p><p>Part 1 of this article is theoretical and explanatory, Part 2
practical. I first define VPNs and describe technologies they
employ. I discuss the combination of Linux building blocks used by
the HOWTO for constructing one. In Part 2, I show log and screen
output depicting the results of actually running the script that
constructs the VPN.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2640660"></a>Virtual Private Networks</h2></div></div><p>A VPN uses a public transport&mdash;the Internet&mdash;for private
communications. It applies encryption to preserve privacy.
Traditionally, companies have used private transport to do
that&mdash;dedicated phone lines. The two ways of keeping an electronic
conversation private are to make the line private and the data
private. Dedicated lines are private because the line is private,
i.e., inaccessible to others. VPNs are private because the data is
private, i.e., rendered unintelligible by encryption&mdash;different
means, same result.</p><p>VPNs are most commonly used to connect two networks at
different sites of the same company. The technique in effect plugs
the remote computers into the local network, consolidating the two
physical nets into a single logical one. Remote computers have
access to the same local resources as local ones. At the same time,
remote machines enjoy the same degree of privacy as local ones. All
this is location-transparent in terms of operation (though not
performance) as if they were attached to the local network. This
combination of full participation plus full privacy between
networks, while using a link that isn't private, is the hallmark of
a VPN. The compelling appeal of the VPN is that it's cheap.
Dedicated lines are expensive, so displacing them with a free
transport is economic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x26407c0"></a>The Network&mdash;PPPD and ROUTE</h2></div></div><p>The VPN in the HOWTO is fashioned from two main ingredients:
the secure shell
(<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span>)
and the point-to-point protocol
(<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>). One machine (the &ldquo;local&rdquo;
one in my terminology, &ldquo;master&rdquo; in Mr. Magosanyi's) runs the
HOWTO's script to call another (my &ldquo;remote&rdquo;, his &ldquo;slave&rdquo;). I'll
call these VPN servers. The idea is that they belong to the two
networks to be joined and serve as the contact points or data
conduits between them, on behalf of any remotely situated pair of
workstations that want to converse.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3271t1.large.jpg"><img src="3271t1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Table 1. VPN Layout</p></div></div>
</p><p>The diagram in Table 1 depicts the layout and addresses in
section 4.1 of the VPN HOWTO. For the public Internet addresses
(fellini-out, polanski-out), I have substituted those actually in
force when I generated the screen captures and log snippets shown
later in this article for agreement.</p><p>To construct the VPN, the script on the local VPN server must
execute four main commands, two of them on the remote VPN
server:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> remotely,
triggered somehow on the other VPN server</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> locally, on
the VPN server where the script runs</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span>
locally</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span>
remotely</p></li></ul></div><p>The pppd commands establish a working connection. It's
strictly a bilateral umbilical cord between the VPN servers that
extends no mutual connectivity to workstations on the networks.
That is done by the route commands. Once these commands have been
executed, the two networks have been transparently pooled into a
single group of machines, all mutually visible via Internet
addresses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2641160"></a>The Private&mdash;SSH</h2></div></div><p>Privacy comes through the tool used by the first computer to
trigger commands on the second, because that tool also does
authentication and encryption. It's called the secure shell
program, which is a remote command executor and an encryptor.
Actually, it's a pair of programs, ssh and sshd, deliberately
crafted to work together on the client-server model. Other familiar
programs that use the model are
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span>
and any browser/<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>.</p><p>The &ldquo;d&rdquo; in sshd, ftpd and httpd stands for daemon, a
synonym for server. Server programs are like genies that grant
categories of wishes to their client/petitioners. So, ftpd grants
file wishes to the ftp client and the httpd grants web-page wishes
to a browser client. Likewise, sshd grants remote-command wishes to
the ssh client. Additionally, ssh and sshd are written to encrypt
and decrypt all traffic as it passes between them.</p><p>As a command executor, ssh can process a single command and
exit. Alternatively, it can set up an open-ended login session
where the user submits commands ad hoc. In both cases, ssh delivers
back to the local machine the standard output from commands it
tells sshd to run in the remote machine. The user sits physically
at the local machine, logically logged in and functioning as one of
the remote machine's users. All command or session output is
delivered from the remote machine to his local monitor. This is
much like telnet. Unlike telnet, everything gets encrypted and
decrypted on the fly during the session.</p><p>The first sentence of the ssh man page highlights these
roles:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into
a remote machine and for executing commands in a remote machine. It
is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted
communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure
channel.</p></blockquote></div><p>The syntax for setting up a remote login session is
<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh  -l
</pre>


The syntax for executing a single remote command is
<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh  -l
</pre>


<b  >-l</b> stands for &ldquo;login&rdquo; and specifies the user
name for the remote computer login. The first command form gets you
logged into the other machine as <span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-user</em></span>,
with his login prompt on your screen. The second also logs you in
and launches <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> on the remote machine all
at one stroke. When the command terminates in the latter case, so
does your connection. If <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> is
<b  >ls /home</b>, the listing of the other machine's
/home subdirectory will be delivered to your screen. Here's an
actual screen capture of it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ssh  -l slave  206.170.217.204  ls /home
david
ftp
httpd
panderson
samba
slave
</pre>


The login prompt is that of the local machine, where the user is
seated. The output comes from the remote machine, where
<b  >ls</b> was run (as a user on that machine called
slave), but appears here on the local monitor. It shows the
contents found in the remote directory /home.
</p><p>Notice execution was unimpeded by password challenge. This is
surprising for a program that's supposed to provide security.
However, ssh did authenticate in an alternative, transparent way;
its technique uses public-key cryptography and is called RSA
authentication. I'll show you the evidence from the remote
machine's log file, then explain how the keys work.</p><p>Concurrent with the above local activity, these entries
appeared in the remote machine's log file
(/var/log/messages):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Nov  7 20:15:54 localhost sshd[1400]: log: Connection from 206.170.218.30 port 1023
Nov  7 20:15:57 localhost sshd[1400]: log: RSA authentication for slave accepted.
Nov  7 20:15:57 localhost sshd[1402]: log: executing remote command as user slave
Nov  7 20:15:58 localhost sshd[1400]: log: Closing connection to 206.170.218.30
Nov  7 20:15:58 localhost PAM_pwdb[1400]: (ssh) session closed for user slave
</pre><p>Note that these entries were authored by sshd, the server
half of the secure shell tandem of programs. That's reasonable,
since the calling program on the local machine was the client half,
ssh. By design, ssh calls and asks for the sshd process, hooking up
to it by TCP port number where sshd runs, 22 by default but
configurable. <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> then swings
into action and they proceed to do their thing: authenticate and
encrypt. We just saw secondary evidence of the authentication,
although so far we've seen no evidence of the encryption. Both rely
on the use of keys, in particular the matched pairs of keys that
characterize public-key cryptography. Let me describe the essential
theory and how you configure ssh with keys, before explaining how
authentication results from their use.
</p><p>First, here's a good nutshell summary from the README.SSH
file:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>When started, ssh connects sshd on the server
machine, verifies that the server machine really is the machine it
wanted to connect, exchanges encryption keys (in a manner which
prevents an outside listener from getting the keys), performs
authentication using...RSA authentication.... The server then
(normally) allocates a pseudo-terminal and starts an interactive
shell or user program.</p></blockquote></div><p>Note that using ssh's <b  >-v</b> option allows you
to watch these activities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2641cb8"></a>Public/Two-Key Cryptography</h2></div></div><p>Public-key cryptography is the historical successor to
secret-key cryptography. I call them two-key and single-key
cryptography. Early ciphers used the very same key to decrypt as to
encrypt. When sending a recipient your scrambled message, you must
somehow also supply him your key to enable unscrambling.</p><p>The Achilles heel is that you may not supply the key using
the same communications channel you are trying to secure. By
presupposition, it needs securing&mdash;information on it is available
to others. Others' inability to penetrate the scrambled messages
you plan to send relies on keeping your key secret from them. But
if you send it over that channel to your intended recipient, you
are in effect sending it to others too, defeating your purpose. The
term &ldquo;secret-key&rdquo; for this type of cipher reflects its
requirement for keeping the key secret so it can work.</p><p>With public-key cryptography, there are two keys: a scrambler
and a mathematically corresponding unscrambler. A person never
gives out the unscrambler. Instead, he distributes the scrambler.
Unlike a secret key, it doesn't unscramble anything. It doesn't
possess the ability or value of unscrambling power. Therefore&mdash;drum
roll&mdash;it's okay if it gets publicly intercepted.</p><p>Also, the parties&mdash;sender/encryptor and
recipient/decryptor&mdash;reverse roles. The recipient-to-be, not the
sender, generates the keys. And he, not the sender, distributes the
necessary (scrambler) key to the other person. Security comes from
the fact that the &ldquo;power&rdquo; key&mdash;the unscrambler&mdash;reposes from the
start with the recipient where it's needed and never needs to
travel. Transmission risk is thereby eliminated. Achilles heel
solved.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2a3a118"></a>SSH Authentication</h2></div></div><p>Now let's see how ssh uses public-key cryptography for RSA
authentication, and how it handles encryption. It has a utility,
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh-keygen</b></span>, that generates matched
key pairs and writes them into disk files. Typically, each user who
wishes to use ssh/sshd will generate his own key pair, whether
actively by running commands on other computers or passively by
having users from other computers log in with his user name to run
commands. <span   class="bold"><b>ssh-keygen</b></span> writes the
two key-files into the logged-in user's home directory. The file
identity.pub contains the public key suitable for distribution to
others and is pure ASCII. The file identity contains the private
key to be kept secret. A user runs ssh-keygen only once. Table 2 is
the layout of these and some other important ssh files (not all
discussed here).</p><p><a href="3271t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a></p><p>User authentication works as an interplay between users' key
files. (ssh also offers host authentication, involving
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key, not discussed here.) I'm talking about the
two users who are always party to an ssh connection. First, when
you run ssh from the local machine, you are already logged into it
as somebody. Second, with the <b  >-l</b> option in your
ssh command, you specify some target user on the remote machine as
the operator there. I'll call these local-user and remote-user.
Another key-related file in each ssh user's home directory is
authorized_keys. To succeed, RSA authentication must find a copy of
local-user's public key embedded in remote-user's authorized_keys
file. This will never happen except deliberately. If I, as the
local-user, want to be able to log into your machine as you, I send
you my public key. I could send you a copy of my identity.pub as a
file, or embed its contents in an e-mail message (since it's pure
ASCII and security of key transmittal is unimportant). You, the
remote-user, will then place my public key into your
authorized_keys file with an editor. Authorization will now succeed
when I use ssh to log into your machine as you. Conversely, if I
want to let you log into my machine as me, you'll send me your
public key and I'll drop it into my authorized_keys file.</p><p>Authentication by sshd on the remote machine uses the
local-user's public key to encrypt something and ship it back to
local machine. Local machine must then prove itself by decrypting
and sending back to the remote machine data matching the original.
At that point, authentication is complete.
<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> writes &ldquo;RSA authentication
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-user</em></span> accepted&rdquo; into the remote log
(as above), and lets the session or command proceed. For
implementation purposes, you simply need to follow the key
prepositioning rules when configuring the computers to interact
through ssh.</p><p>As we noticed earlier, this method doesn't involve any
password. It cares only whether the &ldquo;petitioning&rdquo; user can
convincingly come up with the expected public key and then
demonstrate his possession of the matching private one. While it's
counterintuitive, I routinely log into remote machines without a
password&mdash;as root!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> offers other
authentication methods, password checking among them (ssh is
extensive, with many more options in its configuration files).
These methods can be used instead of or in combination with RSA
authentication. For purposes of a VPN, given that RSA
authentication satisfies the test of adequate security for most,
using it alone is preferred because of its transparency.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2a3a640"></a>ssh Encryption</h2></div></div><p>Once authenticated, the local user can freely operate as the
specified user on the remote machine. There, on his behalf, sshd
runs the requested command or shell and sends any standard output
back to the local machine, but not before first encrypting it.
Direct conversation between the machines is all between ssh and
sshd. So, ssh is there on the receiving end, knowing what to do
with the incoming data stream (decrypt it) and how (using the
agreed key). The same thing happens with reverse traffic, ssh
encrypting and sshd decrypting.</p><p>You might think the encryption key used on each machine for
outbound data would be the public key of the other machine's user.
However, for performance reasons, ssh and sshd settle instead on a
different, secret-key during their initial negotiation phase, and
both use that same key for encrypting the session. While
ssh-keygen's public/private keys play the central role in
authentication, their role in encryption is solely to impenetrably
encrypt the initial exchange of this secret key, overcoming the key
exchange weakness in secret key cryptography. For ongoing message
encryption, however, the public/private keys are not used.
Secret-key algorithms are faster than public/private-key
algorithms. The securely exchanged secret key, called the &ldquo;session
key&rdquo;, is used to encrypt the rest of the session.</p><p>The important point is that once the session gets underway,
ssh and sshd operate as transparent intermediary processes such
that the entire session gets encrypted. Nothing moves between the
machines unscrambled, so meaningful interception is
impossible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2a3a7f8"></a>Blending the Ingredients</h2></div></div><p>Now we can put together our VPN. The trick is to
strategically submit a certain command for ssh to launch remotely.
That command is pppd, the point-to-point protocol daemon.</p><p>We know that during a session, ssh and sshd encrypt the
entire dataflow of whatever command(s) they launch as it passes
between them. The duration of a session is as long as the command
takes to execute. So, for commands that run straightaway to
termination like <b  >ls /home</b>, the session is
transient because the command is transient. Not all commands are
this expeditious, for example, an editor or pppd.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh  -l
</pre><p>This command stays up all day&mdash;you have to kill it to stop
it.
</p><p>Critical for achieving VPN functionality, pppd is itself a
traffic carrier for other programs. This implies that everything
passing between two computers via a pppd interface launched under
ssh control automatically goes through the encryption mill.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2548580.0x2a3aab8"></a>The Virtual</h2></div></div><p>Combined with routing, this bilateral umbilical link broadens
into a general-purpose bridge that can carry conversations between
any pair of workstations on opposite sides. Routing lets each
workstation on one LAN <span   class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> those on the
opposite LAN by IP address&mdash;one big happy family. At the same time,
ssh denies that visibility to the outside world. This is precisely
the effect of having all the workstations local. With this setup,
you have the equivalent of a single LAN, but because that's not
truly what you have, your consolidated network is
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo;.</p><p>What can workstations on opposite LANs do here? Whatever a
pair of workstations on the same LAN can&mdash;more generally, whatever
any machines mutually addressable by IP addresses can. In my
experience, examples of actual operations between remote machine
pairs on a Linux VPN include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Microsoft computers conducting MS peer-to-peer
resource sharing.</p></li><li><p>A Linux machine serving resources to MS machines by
running Samba.</p></li><li><p>An MS machine running a terminal emulator on an IBM
AIX UNIX machine.</p></li><li><p>A Linux or MS machine using TELNET to log into
another Linux or UNIX machine.</p></li></ul></div><p>Interacting machines don't know their conversation is being
encrypted for much of its journey. They just launch packets at one
another by IP address and let their routing tables figure it out.
Upon reaching their VPN server, the routing table there points
these packets across the ppp interface operated by ssh. That's
where the security comes in; otherwise, it's nothing more than
routing as usual.
</p><p>That's it for the theory. It's virtual. It's private. It's a
network. So, I trust you'd agree, it's a virtual private network.
Part 2 will cover practical operation of the VPN HOWTO script in
detail.</p><p><a href="3271s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
