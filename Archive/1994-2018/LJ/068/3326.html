    How to create and install a system call in Linux and install
    an interrupt for controlling the serial port.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x23172f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is based on my experiences
in creating and installing a system call in Linux and how to
install one interrupt vector to control the serial port. In one
way, this is a mini-HOWTO about these two topics.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x23173f8"></a>What is a System Call?</h2></div></div><p>A system call (or system request) is a call to the kernel in
order to execute a specific function that controls a device or
executes a privileged instruction. The way system calls are handled
is up to the processor. Usually, a call to the kernel is due to an
interrupt or exception; in the call, there is a request to execute
something special. For example, the serial port may be programmed
to assert an interrupt when some character has arrived, instead of
polling for it. This way, the processor can be used by other
processes and service the serial port only when it is
required.</p><p>The internal operation between an interrupt request and its
servicing involve several CPU registers and memory segments.
Briefly, a device raises an interrupt by asserting an interrupt
request line on the Peripheral Interrupt Controller (PIC) which
informs the CPU by setting the interrupt request pin. After each
instruction, the CPU checks this pin. If it is enabled, it gets the
ID from the data bus, which points to the Interrupt Descriptor
Table (IDT), where a number of task, interrupt and gate descriptors
are stored. The descriptor contains a selector to the Global
Descriptor Table (GDT) which contains the base address to a memory
segment in which the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
resides.</p><p>Note that the CPU has suspended the process it was executing,
so it has to save some information to be able to resume the process
after the interrupt has been serviced&mdash;this is a context switching.
Several files are involved in this process; most can be found in
the linux/arch/i386/kernel/ directory. One is entry.S, an entry
point to all system calls which initializes the treatment of
exceptions. Another is irq.c, which contains the functions to deal
with interrupts. The linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S file initializes
the GDT, installs virtual memory, etc. There are many connections
between files ending in .h and .c. You can check irq.c to see how
many includes are there to get macros definitions, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>cli()</b></span>, which clears interrupts in
linux/include/asm-i386/system.h.</p><p>To follow the definition path of any function, type at your
command prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep cli 'find / -name '*.[ch]'
-print'
</pre><p>This will search all files with extension c and h in the root
directory for the word cli. Also, you can issue the command
<b  >man 2 intro</b> to see something about system calls.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x2317768"></a>Implementation of System Calls</h2></div></div><p>There are several ways to create, install and execute a
system call. The best is the one that isn't concerned with
low-level details like context switching and doesn't code any
routines in assembly language. This can be done through the use of
the <span   class="bold"><b>_syscall</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>
macro in the linux/include/asm/unistd.h directory; it is expanded
in assembly, but the operating system takes care of details. It
uses the <b  >int 0x80</b> to transfer execution control
to the kernel. One possible problem is this macro can expand to an
existing function, so care must be taken; otherwise, you will
overwrite the existing function.</p><p>In order to implement your own system calls, you should have
the Linux kernel source code (first make a backup) to use as the
working copy. As superuser (root), create in your home directory an
entire tree copy of /usr/src/linux, as you will not have the chance
to do so again. The files we will use are in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>somewhere</em></span>/linux/.</p><p>Now you must choose a name for every function you are
planning to implement. You can check the existing ones in your
source tree at linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S and
linux/include/asm/unistd.h. In entry.S, they are at the end, and in
unistd.h, at the beginning. Checking these files will also help you
get an idea of how to create a prototype of a system call. While
checking, you will see that each call is associated with one
number. This number is passed in the <b  >%eax</b>
processor register indicating the number of arguments, and each
argument of the system call (a function) is passed in
<b  >%ebx</b>, <b  >%ecx</b>,
<b  >%edx</b>, <b  >%esi</b> or
<b  >%edi</b>--up to five arguments on Intel platforms.
The macro definitions corresponding to each
_syscall<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>, depending on the value of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>, can be found in unistd.h. More on the
internal workings can be found in various files under
linux/arch/i386/, because we will leave the &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; to the
operating system.</p><p>Now let's see how to implement a new system call using the
syscall<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> macro in the simplest possible way.
Let's make a system call <span   class="bold"><b>sysSum</b></span>,
which accepts two integer arguments and returns the sum of the two.
Also, it uses <span   class="bold"><b>printk</b></span>, which is
similar to <span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> except that it
works on the kernel level, so we will see when our function is
called.</p><p>To do this, edit a randomly selected file (for example, the
file linux/ipc/sem.c), and at the end, add the following
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
asmlinkage int sysSum(int a, int b)
{
        printk("calling sysSum\n");
        return a+b;
}
</pre><p>Then edit unistd.h and add
<pre     class="programlisting">
#define __NR_sysSum     171
</pre>


<b  >171</b> is the next in numerical order. In entry.S
near the end, add
<pre     class="programlisting">
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sysSum)
</pre>


Finally, increment by one the number that is the last line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.space (NR_syscall-172)*4
</pre>


If you don't match number and name in both files, you will get an
&ldquo;undefined reference to sysSum&rdquo; error message. If you have a
working kernel, you have to be careful only about incrementing the
numbers by one and correctly writing your function name. At this
point, you have added your system call; now you should get the new
kernel with it. To recompile the kernel, take the following
sequential steps:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#make config
#make dep
#make clean
#make zImage
#cat ~/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage &gt;/dev/fd0
</pre>


Step 1 creates the basic kernel configuration; you can skip it next
time if no hardware changes are made. Step 2 checks that any
dependency between files is correct. Step 3 cleans any compilation
intermediate file (object files, etc.). The last two create a
compressed kernel image and copy it to floppy, so we can try our
new kernel and keep the original one untouched.
</p><p>Reboot using this newly created kernel to invoke the system
call from a user program: simply insert the floppy disk on the
drive and reboot. This simple program tests the newly created
system call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;
_syscall2(int, sysSum, int,a,int,b)
main(){
printf("the sum of 4+3 is %d\n",sysSum(4,3));
}
</pre><p>The <b  >include</b> line indicates where the
_syscall definition is located. The next line says our system call
has a return type of <b  >int</b> and two arguments of
type <b  >int</b>. To compile, use the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -I ~/linux/include
</pre>


to instruct the compiler to use our include file. After execution,
you will see messages: first the one from sysSum, then the one from
the test program.
</p><p>The functions we will implement will be the basic ones needed
to control the serial port using interrupts on character reception.
The serial ports can't be accessed by a common user. In Linux, the
functions <span   class="bold"><b>inb</b></span>(port) and
<span   class="bold"><b>outb</b></span>(byte, port) exist to receive
and send one byte; <span   class="bold"><b>inw</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>outw</b></span> do the same on two-byte data.
In order to use them, you have to gain the rights by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>iopl</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>ioperm</b></span> functions, which must be
invoked as super user and will give the common user application
access to the I/O ports.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x2318688"></a>The Serial Port</h2></div></div><p>The serial port, called UART or RS-232, has two I/O addresses
given by BIOS (on PC systems) associated with it and one IRQ
(interrupt request) for each. Fortunately, they are the same as in
DOS:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
COM1 0x3F8 IRQ4
COM2 0x2F8 IRQ3
</pre><p>Each I/O port has a range of addresses to hold various
support registers. COM1 is mapped in memory from 0x3F8 to 0x3FF,
and COM2 from 0x2F8 to 0x2FF. See Table 1 for a description of some
of them. To set one bit in any register, first read the actual
value, and then <b  >OR</b> with the desired value, thus
preserving the other bit values.
</p><p><a href="3326t1.jpg" target="_self">Table 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x2318948"></a>The Serial Port Syscall</h2></div></div><p>The functions we are going to implement are the ones shown in
Table 2. At this time, we will use IRQ4, but it's not difficult to
use the other port or implement a select port routine.</p><p><a href="3326t2.jpg" target="_self">Table 2</a></p><p><a href="3326l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>As you can see in Listing 1, we set some defines and global
variables, save flags and disable interrupts to make our
transaction atomic:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
save_flags;
cli();
</pre><p>If an interrupt with higher priority takes the processor, the
UART will be initialized incorrectly. We also need to indicate the
routine or interrupt vector that services IRQ4. To service the
interrupts, we use <span   class="bold"><b>request_irq</b></span> (in
linux/arch/i386/kernel/irq.c) that is more or less the equivalent
of <span   class="bold"><b>setvect</b></span> in DOS. Its prototype
is
<pre     class="programlisting">
int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
void (*handler) (int, void *, struct pt_regs *),
unsigned long irqflags,
        const char *devname,
        void *dev_id)
</pre>


and we call it with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
i = request_irq (
myirq,sioRead,SA_INTERRUPT,"sioJRMS",NULL);
if (i) return -1;
</pre>


where <span   class="emphasis"><em>myirq</em></span> is equal to 4 (the COM1 IRQ),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sioRead</em></span> is a void pointer to the interrupt
vector, that is, the routine that will service the interrupt; and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SA_INTERRUPT</em></span> is a flag that states our
interrupt will be of type &ldquo;fast&rdquo; or non-maskable.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sioJRMS</em></span> is a name generally used to identify
device drivers, but is used here to monitor the interrupts serviced
by our routine by looking at the /proc/interrupts file. Once our
program is running, we check this file to see if our interrupt has
been set. If the value returned for <span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> is 0,
the interrupt vector is installed.
</p><p>Next we have to set some UART initial values by using the
outb function. Remember, at this time we are a superuser. After we
have created our system calls, recompiled the kernel and rebooted
with it, these functions will be available as an interface to the
serial port in a library for every user without requiring special
privileges. We use a constant, <b  >PORT</b>, to identify
the port address, so you can change it later.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
outb(0,PORT + 1);     /* Disable interrupts - bit
                          0 -&gt;0 */
outb(0x80,PORT + 3);  /* enable DLAB - bit 7 -&gt;1*/
outb(0x0C,PORT + 0);  /* Set Divisor LSB */
outb(0x00,PORT + 1);  /* Set Divisor MSB */
outb(0x03,PORT + 3);  /* 8 Bits, No Parity, 1
                           Stop Bit */
outb(0xC7,PORT + 2);  /* Enable FIFO if UART is
                         16500+ */
outb(0x0B,PORT + 4);  /* Turn on DTR, RTS, and
                         OUT2 */
outb(0x01,PORT + 1);  /* Interrupt when data
                         received */
</pre><p>These instructions set an initial baud rate of 9600. To set
to a different rate, divide 115,200 (crystal frequency) by the
divisor formed by registers 3F8 (MSB) and 3F9 (LSB) when bit 7 of
3FB is 1. Now that we have initialized the UART, we can restore
flags with the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
restore_flags(flags);
</pre>


We don't need <span   class="bold"><b>sti</b></span> (set
interrupts), because it is done automatically by
<span   class="bold"><b>restore_flags</b></span>. Next, define the
routine that will service the interrupt to read a character and put
it in a circular queue:
<pre     class="programlisting">
static void sioHandler(int myirq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs * regs)
{
 int i;
 do { i = inb(PORT + 5);
        if (i &amp; 1) {
                buffer[bufferin] = inb(PORT);
                bufferin++;
                if (bufferin == 1024) bufferin = 0;
                }
        }while (i &amp; 1);
}
</pre>


The next function is the one available as a syscall to all users:
<pre     class="programlisting">
asmlinkage int sioRead(void)
{
char ch;
if (bufferin != bufferout){
        ch = buffer[bufferout];
        bufferout++;
        if (bufferout == 1024) bufferout = 0;
          return ch;
        }
}
</pre>


It will return a character from the buffer. The purpose of other
syscalls is explained in Listing 1. Now we have to deal with
informing the kernel that new system calls are created, using the
steps mentioned previously.
</p><p>In unistd.h, we put a line for each one of the newly created
syscalls:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define __NR_sioEnable          170
#define __NR_sioRead            171
#define __NR_sioWrite           172
#define __NR_sioEnd             173
#define __NR_sioSetDivisor      174
#define __NR_sioGetDivisor      175
</pre><p>Note that the corresponding numbers will vary depending on
the total number of system calls you have. In the entry.s file, put
the lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioEnable)
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioRead)
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioWrite)
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioEnd)
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioSetDivisor)
.long SYMBOL_NAME(sioGetDivisor)
</pre>


and remember to increment the number in the last line.
<pre     class="programlisting">
.space (NR_syscalls-177)*4
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x230fd30"></a>Adding a Makefile</h2></div></div><p>This time, we are not going to modify any files. Instead, we
will create our library with our system calls. First, create a
directory called /sio under the kernel source tree. Within it, you
are going to create a file called sio.c which will contain the
entire source of Listing 1 with all the includes, defines and
system calls we have created. Now, in order to rebuild the new
kernel with our library, we have to create a Makefile, also located
in the /sio directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#Makefile for Serial Input/Output system calls
O_OBJS = sio.o
O_TARGET = siocalls.o
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
</pre><p>This file will invoke <b  >Rules.make</b> under our
Linux source directory. Also, the top-level Makefile (the first
under your source directory) will work for us. Edit this Makefile,
define where the directories of sources are defined, and add our
new directory with the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SIOCALLS = sio/siocalls.o
</pre>


This appends the name of our directory to the path of source
directories. Because we are using outb, we must compile with
<b  >-O</b> or <b  >-O2</b> to enable
optimization to allow the use of inline macros. Don't worry&mdash;the
top-level Makefile does this. Now follow the steps mentioned
earlier to recompile the kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x221f580.0x2310048"></a>Testing the New Syscall</h2></div></div><p>To work with our system calls over the serial port, make a
serial cable in null modem configuration. You will need two DB-9
connectors and wire 2-3, 3-2, 4-6, 6-4, 5-5, 7-8 and 8-7 pins. Then
reboot with the new kernel and use some program like the one in
Listing 2 in the archive file (see Resources) as a non-superuser,
and you will see you have control of the serial port using our
functions. Remember to connect two Linux boxes with the cable
settings described in the COM1 port.</p><p><a href="3326s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
