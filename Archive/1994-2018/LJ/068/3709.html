the O'Reilly Open Source Software Convention in Monterey,
California. It was a great location, great weather and a great
conference. The first two days were tutorials, followed by two days
of conferences and the trade show. The show was generally
excellent, with over 1600 attendees.
</p><p>The conference was an outgrowth of a Perl conference, and it
had tracks on Linux, Apache, Python, Sendmail and Tcl/Tk, as well
as the Perl track. This variety of tracks afforded a great
opportunity for the various open-source software tribes to get to
know each other.</p><p>I tried to play the field and attended a Samba tutorial in
the Linux track, a <span   class="bold"><b>modperl</b></span>
tutorial in the Apache track, a Tcl/Tk introduction, and a Python
tools for XML programming tutorial.</p><p>During the two days of the conference, I spent some time in
conferences, including keynotes by Guy Kawasaki and Bill Joy, and
some time at the <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth. As a
whole, it was a great conference. Miguel de Iscaza, leader of the
GNOME project, summed it up by pointing out that, unlike other
recent shows, this really was a conference for developers by
developers. From the tutorials to the included lunches, good
organization and good content were evident everywhere. I look
forward to attending the conference again next year.</p><p>With a large Python track, Guido von Rossum was, of course,
in attendance. Our scheduled 30-minute interview turned into an
enjoyable three-and-one-half-hour evening on the Monterey
waterfront. The first part of the interview is included here. After
this interview, Guido went on to talk about CP4E, his project to
turn Python into the language used in colleges. That portion of our
interview is here:
<a href="../000/5028.html" target="_self">An Interview with Guido van Rossum</a>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Python vs. Perl?
Obvious question. I heard last night that some Python guys and Perl
guys met, and now you are good buddies. Or actually John Orwant
said, &ldquo;The Python guys are a lot nicer than the Perl
guys.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: The funny thing is
that while there is a lot of animosity in the lower ranks, I've
actually been very friendly with Larry Wall and Tom Christiansen
ever since we met five years ago at the VHLL symposium that Tom
organized. Tom really wanted me there and made sure I was among the
invited speakers describing one of the three major scripting
languages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: What was the
third?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Tcl. Well, maybe
Python was the third!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I've been doing shell
programming and AWK programming for close to 20 years and if
somebody says, &ldquo;Here, can you write this in Perl?&rdquo; the answer is,
&ldquo;Well, yeah I can,&rdquo; and the reason I can is because I've got 20
years of experience writing in all the pieces that make up Perl.
But to go out and tell somebody, &ldquo;Oh, you are going to learn a new
programming language and the design of this language makes perfect
sense&rdquo; is an issue. I don't see how I can do that with Perl, and
yet I can do that with Python. That's the distinction for
me.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I think the core of
the matter is that Perl has a very UNIX background and claims to be
portable. If you talk to people, they all think Windows stinks and
UNIX is the one true operating system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I think that
too!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Well, you better,
given your choice of profession! That is a very typical point of
view you find a lot in the Perl world. There also seems to be a bit
of dislike for GUIs or anything that smells of user friendly. Part
of the UNIX community has that dislike. I grew up in a research
environment where we used UNIX; we were one of the earliest UNIX
sites in Europe and one of the earliest Internet sites in Europe as
well. But we weren't so partial to UNIX. We were interested in what
came next. For a while, I considered myself a
graphical-user-interface designer&mdash;learned a lot about user
interfaces.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: What were you doing at
the design end? Or what were you implementating on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Oh, the
implementation varies&mdash;eleven X Window systems as well as
Macintosh. I almost never touched a Windows box until Windows 95.
Because, before that, any GUI programming was hell. Windows has
grown up a lot. There was actually an interesting Python on
Windows, even with Windows 3.1. I think that's where Mark Hammon
started, actually.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: You said you are not
really using Linux right now. What are you using as a
platform?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: At work, I have a
very big Solaris box on my desk. At home, I have a laptop fast
enough and big enough to serve as a desktop machine, and it
dual-boots Windows 98 and Linux. I use Windows just for
compatibility with many of the people at work and for historical
reasons, because we were using a lot of Windows applications. I
don't use Windows much for programming; the only programming I do
on Windows is&mdash;well, there are two kinds&mdash;little games programmed
in Python, toy applications for testing some idea where it doesn't
matter which platform I'm using, and maintenance for the Python
port to Windows. The Python port to Windows has two components to
it&mdash;the core part, which I manage, and the old Windows-specific
additions, which Mark Hammon manages. So people typically download
two files, and they can get both from
<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">http://www.python.org/</a>.
The first one is the standard Python distribution which gives you a
command-line interpreter, documentation and the standard library&mdash;a
bunch of goodies. And then, actually, I looked at a bunch of
statistics&mdash;one third of the people who download Windows installers
also download Mark Hammon's extensions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: What's the ratio of
Windows users to UNIX users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I don't know about
actual users, but downloads from python.org are something like
two-thirds Windows and one-third UNIX. All sorts of explanations
for that, probably because the UNIX people can build from source.
One download may represent a larger number of users. With Windows,
I imagine one download often represents one user. Linux, at least,
also has the possibility of downloading RPMs from a different
site&mdash;we don't have any statistics for other sites.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Plus, Python comes
with virtually every Linux distribution anyway.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3709f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Yeah, well, there are
lots of complaints about that. They're not very up-to-date and they
don't have a very large set of standard extensions, so it takes a
little extra work to configure them at compile time. If you want
the full Python installation on your Red Hat Linux, for example,
you want to download all of Andre's stuff.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: By the way, I actually
do use Python. I've been telling people at the office, &ldquo;We've got
to start programming in Python.&rdquo; We went through a couple of Perl
programmers who could produce code extremely fast, but when they
found new jobs, we were sitting around going, &ldquo;What is this
stuff?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: That is one of the
things I've always had as part of my philosophy: it's much more
important that you can read someone else's code than how fast you
can produce your own code. Again, that is something very few people
in the Perl community appreciate. I know Tom Christiansen does
appreciate it. But many of the people who are in the trenches doing
Perl programming don't have the time to learn how to write it
right; they just copy the examples they found in the legacy of the
previous person who was hacking at that site.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Sometimes that's fine.
I write a lot of disposable stuff in AWK. Here is some data, I've
got to turn it into something and load it&mdash;fine.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: As long as you
actually dispose of it!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Exactly!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: My dad used to say
there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution. A lot of
disposable software ends up persisting beyond all reason.</p><p>That is actually one of the big differences between the Perl
philosophy and the Python philosophy. Perl gives you lots of
different ways of doing things which makes it much harder for the
reader, because if you are writing code, you need to know only what
you know&mdash;you need to know only one way to do what you want to do.
But, if you are reading, you need to know everything before you can
actually read it. I mean, it's not so different from understanding
a language like English. My passive vocabulary, what I can
understand when people speak to me, is a lot larger than my active
vocabulary&mdash;the words I can actually use myself. Not growing up as
a native speaker, my active vocabulary is smaller than that of a
typical native speaker. For the casual programmer, you have the
same situation where you know enough of the language to get by for
your own programming needs. But if someone else presents you with
something he wrote, he probably knows a different subset, and there
is no agreement on what the basic 600 words are that you both need
to know to get by. It's often quicker to run a program and see the
results, then reproduce the code in an idiom you know and start
hacking on corrections, than it is to try to understand how the
code works and change that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>:
That's similar to what IBM did with PL/1, the ultimate language. If
you went into a company that had both FORTRAN and Cobol programmers
and you said, &ldquo;You are all going to write in PL1,&rdquo; then the Cobol
programmers wrote Cobol in PL/1 and the FORTRAN programmers wrote
FORTRAN in PL/1!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: And the Algol
programmers wrote Algol in PL/1.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: It seems like Python
is starting to be taken really seriously in web development and so
on. Is Python being taken seriously in academia? I guess I mean
relative to Perl, because Perl isn't, as far as I can see.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I would say Python is
being taken a lot more seriously. There are language designers who
don't approve of certain short cuts, or the fact that Python
doesn't have static typing, or the fact that there are other
languages out there that are as good as Python is, and again borrow
all the good features from those languages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: What languages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Some people think,
for instance, that Dylan&mdash;which I think has a very academic
flavor&mdash;is everything Python is plus so much more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Dylan? I've never
heard of it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Well, that's exactly
Dylan's problem. I don't know, but I think it started out as a LISP
variant, with sort of an alternative syntax. The syntax was
deliberately unLISPish in order not to scare off everyone who is
not already brainwashed with LISP, because LISP has one of the
biggest image problems of any programming language in the
world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I had to learn LISP in
college, and I can appreciate that! Keypunching parentheses is not
my favorite thing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I like a lot of the
concepts of LISP, but I strongly disagree with their approach to
syntax, which happens to be the same approach Tcl has, more or
less. Which is, there is no syntax, or it's so simple you have to
do everything else outside the syntax.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Is Tcl making it at
all in academia?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I am sort of removed
from academia, so I don't quite know. I don't think so. I mean, one
or two people I spoke to recently from academia had a very strong
opinion that Python was a decent language and Perl and Tcl were
not.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: To me, the biggest
thing lacking in Python is books. To learn the language, basically,
there are three books out there: the two O'Reilly books and the one
you wrote...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I didn't write
that!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Okay, the book you
didn't write!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Aaron Watters wrote
it. I was originally supposed to write one chapter. When I came
back from vacation ready to write the chapter, they had changed the
deadline and already started printing! So I thought, hmmm, good!
Until the beginning of this year, there were clearly too few books.
Right now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span> is by far my
favorite Python book.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Hey! It's mine
too!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Yeah. I think what
we'll see is that several other publishers will start publishing
Python books. I mean, I've been talking to authors, and I actually
managed to piss one off because I didn't like the chapter he sent
me. But everyone else I'm fairly okay with. And the one I pissed
off is going to continue anyway, so more power to him. There will
probably be five or six more books by the end of the year. Mark
Hammon and Andy Robinson have almost completed another O'Reilly
Python book, specifically for Windows users. Dave Beazley, who is
solidly in academia&mdash;an assistant professor at the University of
Chicago&mdash;has already finished writing and turned in the manuscript
for a quick Python book for the experienced programmer. It has all
the information you need to learn the language quickly and start
using it. There is one big appendix in the book which is almost the
entire library reference manual. All the relevant things are in the
New Riders series. I think two different people are working on
Python books with Tkinter. There is another quick Python
introduction, and plans for something like an 800-page book with
lots of annotated examples. So there is lots of stuff coming out,
and it's aimed at a much larger variety of users. The first books
that come out try to be everything for everyone, and that is kind
of hard.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3709f3.jpg"></div>
 <span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I
guess the big thing you are playing with now is JPython?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: JPython is really
big, but I'm not personally very involved, actually. One of my
well-respected colleagues at the CNRI (Corporation for National
Research Initiatives) is now doing the maintenance after Jim
Hugunin (see
<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">http://www.python.org/</a>)
and the original author have decided to move to the West
Coast.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: JPython is a really
neat thing. If Java actually becomes the success it wishes to be
...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Java is a decent
language, but it really needs a companion like Python. I have to
admit that was one of the things I was very skeptical about
initially when Jim Hugunin came up with the idea. I thought, &ldquo;Oh,
my! That is going to be so slow! That's not going to be worth it.&rdquo;
It was a little slow, but not so slow as to be unusable. I had to
push Jim to add some psychological tricks to the way the
interpreter initializes itself. I think the current version quickly
prints the command line, the first prompt and then actually
finishes initialization. This has the advantage that during the
second or so it takes you to type your first command, the
initialization finishes, so when you hit return, you have an
instant response.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I worked for a
computer sciences department on the development of an operating
system in 1970 when everyone was using a teletype. We had a basic
interpreter, and when you typed <b  >run</b>, the basic
interpreter printed out the name of the program and the current
date and time. It did that to cover up the fact that it was
compiling it into byte code before it was going to run. Same story,
but you had a lot more time when you had about 50 characters to
print on a 10-character-per-second teletype.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Well, that kind of
trick still works, but JPython is its own world. I think it is the
only language integrated with Java in this particular way, where
you basically have cross-language inheritance. You can inherit in
Java from a Python class and vice versa, and you can override
methods in each direction. So the people who use it, use it
typically as an extension language for a large system totally or
almost totally written in Java, where they need to provide some
end-user program ability. I think one product, Object Domain, is an
application that is sort of UML for Java programs, and you can do
all sorts of manipulations with the UML objects. In a little corner
of the screen is a Python prompt&mdash;when what you can do with the
menus doesn't give you enough flexibility, you can write your own
Python code right there and execute it. That is how JPython is used
as an extension language to Java. That is the equivalent of what
people have been doing with CPython in C or C++ applications all
this time. But with Java, there really weren't very many options
like that, and Javascript hasn't made it outside the embedded HTML
world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I haven't done much
with Javascript.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: It's actually a
decent language. It doesn't have the whole object-oriented kit and
kaboodle Python has, and that's its big weakness. Actually,
Javascript and Python share a lot of syntactical ideas, and the
dynamics of the language is also more or less the same. It's
probably purely coincidental.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: In the near future, we
will be developing some software that needs a local user as well as
a web-based human interface and a database back end. The local user
interface needs to be semi-graphical with minimal keystrokes. We
are considering using Python and a database such as MySQL or
Postgres. Are we on the right track, or are we crazy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: There are tons of
options. I don't know if you've done any research yet in that area,
but I still like Tkinter best&mdash;it seems to be the most popular. It
is called the de facto standard. I like it because it is portable
between Windows, UNIX and Macintosh. I think the only other option
that has those three platforms is WX Windows, which is a big
C++-based thing. It used to have a Python port that was fairly
poor; I think it's all been redone, and I hear it is much better
now. I've never used it myself, because I am so happy with Tk
interface. I've also seen other good things. Some of my colleagues
have just started playing with GTK, and it certainly looks very
slick; the code is about as clean as Tkinter code. Apparently, the
GTK port for Python is actively being maintained, unlike some other
offerings. I think there is a KDE or a Qt port that is not being
maintained any longer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: The biggest problem we
decided we had with most Tk documentation is that it is attached to
Tcl, which is the best way to confuse somebody who is trying to
write something else. I guess there is a book coming out.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: There are already two
books coming out&mdash;I have no idea when exactly, so it may even be
another year. I expect it to be a little earlier than that. In the
meantime, the best place to go for information is the HOWTO
section, or there is some kind of resource guide on the python.org
site where Tkinter is actually one of the topics which basically
has pointers to all the other stuff you need to know. The best
documentation for Tkinter is the web pages Fredrick Lund put
together and had on his Python web site.</p><p>When we designed Tkinter, we were aware of the fact that we
couldn't possibly document it all. Certainly not document all the
semantics. STK was changing because when we started Tkinter, Tcl/Tk
was at release 7.3 or so. We knew Tcl/Tk was going to evolve, so we
ported most parts. We set up a very regular structure of mapping
between Tk commands and Tkinter, mapped in classes. So, you can
prepare a small set of rules that say, if it looks like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> in Tk, it looks like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> in Python. Along with that, there is a
lot of information you can learn from the standard Tcl/Tk
documentation. Tcl/Tk has excellent man pages. Whenever you are
unsure what options to the <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>
command are or how to do a button that has a particular property,
look it up in the Tk documentation and apply the mapping&mdash;sure
enough, it works in the Python world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: That's cool. It's
likely that's the way we will go.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Can I offer one piece
of advice? I think one of the reasons for the success of Python,
Perl, Tcl, Linux and Apache is lots of extensibility. People can
scratch their own itch by writing their own little module that does
what they need to do so they don't have to bother the original
developers with &ldquo;Can you please add this feature?,&rdquo; the problem
every sort of <span   class="emphasis"><em>fixed</em></span> system ends up
with.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I agree completely.
There are just too many pieces of software that were written to
solve somebody's problem but actually didn't solve it, where the
marketing department took care of explaining why it did solve it.
There is a company in Redmond that is really known for doing
exactly that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Their recent
offerings are actually pretty extendable, but where they
aren't&mdash;that's when it's bad.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Is the Python
community ready for a magazine?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Probably not
yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: That's what I told
John Orwant about the Perl community, but he didn't believe
me!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Well, that's good!
With this kind of stuff, I'm always happy to be proven wrong. We
tried an on-line magazine and there were one or two issues and that
was it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yeah, I saw it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Realistically, the
Python community is an order of magnitude smaller than the Perl
community. If you look at the number of Python people at this
conference vs. the whole thing, that's probably an order of
magnitude plus a factor of two maybe. So we need to grow.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: The limiting factor in
any magazine is advertising. When you buy a subscription, that pays
for the postal service to get the magazine to you. It's advertising
revenue that pays for producing the magazine. I feel like Python is
in a place where there really aren't any potential advertisers
except book publishers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: There aren't many
people who have Python products. I mean, there are a lot of people
who have products that use Python in some corner of the product.
There are also lots of people who use Python but don't sell Python
stuff directly. I don't know if you know it, but Industrial Light
and Magic uses Python. Yahoo! bought a small company called 411,
which had one of the earlier more successful web-mail applications
that, not incidentally, was written in Python. Actually, I think
that has happened at least twice now. I know two almost-identical
cases where a small, start-up company used Python very quickly to
prototype and release a product that is first of its kind. They
were the first to market it, and they were so successful they were
bought by a large organization, looking for a product in that area,
whose efforts haven't paid off just yet. Once it gets absorbed into
that big company, what usually happens is it gets rewritten in C++.
That's what's happening with Yahoo! Mail, mainly because they have,
after maybe two years of experience, settled on the course of the
features. Now they are interested in dealing with the 80,000
subscribers they get every week or every day or so. They buy new
hardware too, but you need to use that new hardware efficiently, so
they rewrite the stuff in C++. If anyone had started writing that
stuff from scratch in C++, he would never have gotten the product
out!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: They'd still be
writing it!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Exactly! And because
during the initial three months or so of figuring out exactly what
you want, you rewrite the thing so many times and that's where you
really need the very high-level dynamic range.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: How common is that,
that people are prototyping in Python and rewriting it in C++ or
some other semi-reasonable language?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I'd say it's common
for the things that become a blatant success. Lots of places end up
not bothering doing the rewrite in C++, even though they always
have that as part of their strategy, because the prototype works
well, and performance isn't the problem in many cases.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Certainly over the
years, we have addressed performance by making cheaper hardware
that's faster.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: Such a lovely
development!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I remember UCSD P
system, and other than Pascal, it isn't exactly the savior of world
language. If UCSD P system had appeared with the speed of today's
hardware, it would have been an amazing success because nobody
would have cared. It would have solved the problem.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guido</b></span>: I manage to follow
only a very small piece of the general free software world. But I
am often amazed to see people post a small C program&mdash;maybe a
thousand lines&mdash;that they spent a lot of time on and that does a
job well. And I think, &ldquo;My God! Why did they bother writing it in
C? What's the performance need here?&rdquo; If this is something to
manage your calendar, for example, why would you bother writing
that in C?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Well, that's all I
have to pick on you about. Thanks for taking the time to talk to
me.</p></div></div>
