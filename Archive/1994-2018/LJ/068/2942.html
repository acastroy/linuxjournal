    The Army migrates a war game tool from Hewlett Packard 700
    series workstations using HP-UX to Intel-based Linux
    workstations.

sought to port a military war game simulation to personal computers
for cost reasons. After disappointing results porting the graphics
portion of the war game to Windows 95/NT using Hummingbird's eXceed
X Window Server, the developers were astounded by the performance
using Linux. As a result, the ARNG ported the entire war game
simulation to Linux. The Linux version is currently being fielded
to more than 107 ARNG sites as well as to several foreign
governments.
</p><p>The SIMITAR (SIMulation In Training for Advanced Readiness)
program was established by Congress as an Advanced Research
Projects Agency effort in mid-1992 (Krug and Pickell, Army [ISSN
0004-2455], 46(2):57-59, February 1996). Part of this effort
involved modifying a battlefield synchronization tool called Janus
to train staffs and units at their hometown armories.</p><p>Cubic Applications Inc. (CAI), under contract by the Army
National Guard, was tasked to port one of the sixteen programs
making up the Janus war game from the HP-UX operating system to
Linux. The selected program managed the visualization of the Janus
war game on X Window System capable workstations. The primary
reason for this tasking was to save money on the initial cost of
the platform, and more importantly, to reduce continuing
maintenance costs. CAI ported the graphic program written in C to
three operating systems: Windows 95, Windows NT and Linux. The
X-client environment in the Windows 95/NT operating systems was
provided by Hummingbird Communications, Ltd, eXceed v5.11.</p><p><a href="2942s1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>Table 1 is a comparison of screen refresh times on different
platforms and operating systems as one progressively zooms into a
location having intersecting roads, barriers and mine fields within
the Janus war game simulation. The graphic process was running
locally on each platform. The center of each display was the same
X,Y coordinate.</p><p>Note the large discrepancy between refresh rates at zoom
level 6 among platforms and operating systems. The HP Apollo
715/100 workstation served as our benchmark to compare other
systems against, because it was the fastest POSIX-compliant
computer we had at the beginning of our testing. The range of times
for the HP 715/100 was one to nine seconds.</p><p>The graphics performance of the P200Pro PC and P133 PC
running Windows 95 was considered unacceptable for the live
training environment of the ARNG. The refresh times at zoom factor
6 were 73 and 121 seconds, respectively. Discussion with the
development support staff at Hummingbird Communications Ltd.
revealed further increases in speed could not be achieved. The
Windows 95 X server software had been optimized correctly, and the
P200Pro PC platform was state of the art when these tests were
performed. A Hummingbird staff member suggested the Windows NT
version of eXceed might be faster than the Windows 95
version.</p><p>The graphics performance of the P133 PC running the Windows
NT implementation of eXceed was also considered unacceptable. The
refresh time at zoom factor 6 was 103 seconds. Compared to Windows
95, the Windows NT software performed slower at the extremes, but
faster towards the middle zoom levels. The sum of refresh times for
Windows NT was 527 seconds, compared to 511 seconds for Windows 95.
Overall, the Windows NT port performed slower than the Windows 95
port. We were surprised to discover the Windows NT implementation
did not function unless PC users were given administrator
privileges within the Hummingbird software. It would not work at
all if PC users were given ordinary user privileges. The privilege
anomaly was previously unknown to Hummingbird. Granting super-user
privileges to what should be normal users would be a significant
security breach.</p><p>As a last resort, and actually only after a very casual
mention by co-workers of an operating system found useful for
Internet servers, we investigated the Official Red Hat Linux for
Intel as another possible operating system for controlling the
graphic display of the Janus simulation. Up to this point, we had
never heard of Linux. To say we were suspicious of a free operating
system is putting it mildly.</p><p>We were astonished at the graphics performance of the Linux
operating system. The performance of an entry-level Pentium and a
state-of-the-art PentiumPro with Linux was faster than any
previously tested platform, including the HP 715/100. The graphic
refresh rates for a 200MHz Pentium Pro system ranged from less than
one second to three seconds. The 200MHz Pentium Pro was three times
faster than the HP 715/100 workstation (rated at 10.25 Xmark93
units). Even a 133MHz Pentium with a $90 graphics card was twice as
fast as the HP 715/100, with values from less than one second to
four seconds. As a comparison, the fastest HP workstation at the
time of testing was rated at 41.13 Xmark93 units (C180-XP HP
Visualize-EG using the PA-8000/180MHz processor, retailing at
around $51,400).</p><p>Apparently, the combination of CPU horsepower, accelerated
graphic cards and reduced operating system overhead were
responsible for these dramatic results. In terms of X performance
alone, several high-performance accelerated graphics cards for the
Intel platform outperformed the fastest HP X station at the time of
testing.</p><p>The mid-performance graphic card in the 200MHz Pentium Pro
Linux workstation has been benchmarked at 112,000 Xstones
(1280x1024, 135MHz dot clock rate, 8 bits per pixel, data from
<a href="http://www.goof.com/xbench/summary.html" target="_self">www.goof.com/xbench/summary.html</a>).
State-of-the-art graphics cards are capable of almost 300,000
Xstones. For example, the Diamond Stealth 64 with the S3-968 chip
set (PCI bus, 135MHz dot rate, 1280x1024 resolution, 8 bits per
pixel) was rated at 291,000 Xstones in a 133MHz Pentium Linux
workstation with 16MB of main memory. As a comparison, the Hewlett
Packard series of X stations have been rated by HP as follows:
Entria Color at 106,000 Xstones; Entria Hi-Res Color at 135,000
Xstones; Envizex &ldquo;a&rdquo; series at 168,000 Xstones; and the fastest
Envizex &ldquo;p&rdquo; series at 220,000 Xstones.</p><p>The decision to use Linux workstations was driven by cost and
performance parameters. In terms of cost, the Intel-based Linux
workstations were much cheaper than those from other
POSIX-compliant workstation providers. A 133MHz Pentium-based Linux
workstation (214 MIPS) with 32MB RAM, 2GB hard drive, accelerated
graphics card, 20-inch color monitor and a LAN card cost around
$3,000. The HP 712/100 (122MIPS) with 32MB RAM, 2GB hard drive,
20-inch color monitor and a LAN interface cost around $10,600 (SEWP
contract). At that time, the entry-level HP 712/64 (78MIPS) with
32MB RAM, 1GB hard drive, 20-inch color monitor and a LAN interface
cost around $12,000 (GSA price).</p><p>In terms of the performance/cost ratio (higher number being
better, performance being compared to the HP 715/100), the P133MHz
Linux workstation is 2.25/$3K = 0.75, with the 715/100 being
1/$10.6K = 0.09. The performance/cost ratio of the P133MHz Linux
workstation is 8.3 times (0.75/0.09) greater than the 715/100. In
other words, the Linux workstation gives you 8.3 times the
performance per dollar spent as compared to the HP 715/100.</p><p>The Intel-based Linux workstation is cheaper not only in
terms of initial cost and performance/cost ratio, but also in terms
of adding/repairing/replacing components. To add/repair/replace
Hewlett Packard/Sun/Silicon Graphics workstation components, you
must purchase supported components. For example, adding 64MB of EDO
memory to a Linux workstation at the time of testing cost $500
(price from SW Technology at
<a href="http://www.swt.com" target="_self">http://www.swt.com/</a>).
Adding 64MB of memory to a Hewlett Packard workstation cost $3,800
to 5,600 (depending on the model, data from SEWP contract, CLIN
4.2.1 Memory). Adding a 4X CD-ROM drive to a Linux workstation cost
$91 (price from SW Technology). Adding a 4X CD-ROM drive to a
Hewlett Packard workstation cost $328 to $500 (depending on the
model, data from SEWP contract, CLIN 4.2.4 CD-ROM Drives). Adding a
2GB hard drive to a Linux workstation costs $285 (Maxtor MX72004A,
E-IDE). Adding a 2GB drive to a Hewlett Packard workstation costs
$675 to $2,425 (depending on the model, data from SEWP contract,
CLIN 4.2.2 Mass Storage Mini Towers and Disk Drives). Note that the
SEWP contract prices are much less than the standard 22% discount
Hewlett Packard gives to the government on non-contract
purchases.</p><p>The Linux workstation has yet another advantage over more
traditional graphics workstation providers&mdash;it can be a multi-boot
platform. The partitions can be any combination of MS-DOS, Windows
95/98/NT, OS/2 or Linux. Linux includes the Linux boot loader
(LILO) to specify which partition (operating system) to
load.</p><p>Since the Army chose Hewlett Packard as the platform to
develop and run Janus, no surprises would be lurking around the
corner if the ARNG were to select the Hewlett Packard as the major
Janus display platform. However, the cost/performance analysis
argument, as well as continuing maintenance costs, argued against
purchasing an entire suite of Hewlett Packard workstations.</p><p>In the end, the ARNG decided to purchase around 1700
Intel-based dual-boot Linux/Windows 95 workstations at under $1,800
each. The ARNG is using the Windows 95 side for CD-ROM-based
Distance Learning training tasks. The Linux side is being used for
the Janus war game simulation. Thus, the ARNG was able to get two
disparate uses out of the same platform, with each use requiring a
different operating system.</p><p>As the result of the above work, the ARNG decided to port the
entire Janus simulation (16 programs) to Linux. The mostly FORTRAN
with some C code software was successfully ported in about six
man-weeks from HP-UX to Linux. Almost all of the port problems were
related to flaws in the source code being masked by the forgiving
HP-UX FORTRAN compiler. The hardware being fielded to both execute
and display the Janus simulation is now entirely composed of
Intel-based Linux workstations. The port was performed by CAI's
programmer, Kevin Buehler.</p><p>As one might imagine, the cost savings and performance
increase did not go unnoticed in government circles. As a result of
demonstrating the ARNG's complete port of Janus to the Linux
operating system, the next release of Janus (v7.1) to the active
duty U.S. Army will execute on Intel-based Linux workstations.
Other war game simulations are currently being ported to Linux as a
result of the ARNG's experimental program, using Janus v6.30 as the
base source code.</p><p>We considered Linux as the last resort to solving a problem.
As the good word spreads, perhaps others will consider Linux as the
first resort. Linux saved the ARNG around $8,000,000 in initial
purchase costs alone (not including the more expensive continuing
maintenance costs). What might it save you?</p></div></div>
