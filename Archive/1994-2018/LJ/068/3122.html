    The purpose of this article is to introduce the readers to
    X-ISP.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x21053f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Living in the &ldquo;information highway&rdquo;
era, we must all connect our computers to the Internet to be able
to send e-mail, read newsgroups, browse the Web and communicate
with the world in general.
</p><p>Configuring your machine to connect to the Internet via your
ISP can be an easy or difficult process, depending on your choice
of operating system and tools.</p><p>Since Linux is our platform of choice, we are left to select
the tools to use. Using X-ISP to configure our machine insures that
we can connect our Linux boxes to the Internet in a short time,
without any problems and with the advantage of using an X-based
interface.</p><p>X-ISP is a visual, X11/XForms-based, user-friendly interface
to pppd/chat. It offers an X11 dialup networking tool that can also
act as a small ISP and phone company (PTT) database manager, and
also as a tool to log dialup costs and usage. In addition to that,
it provides maximum feedback from the dialing and login phases on a
message browser (Figure 1), versatility in interrupting a call in
progress, a manual login terminal window as well as call-back and
DNS server selection capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x2105608"></a>User Interface</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3122f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. X-ISP Main Window
</p></div></div><p>The user interface of X-ISP is very simple, intuitive and
user friendly. It consists of a form with four buttons (Connect,
Interrupt, Disconnect and Quit), three menus (Options, Logging and
Help) and a drop-choice list of ISP entries (in case the user wants
to configure the machine to dial more than one ISP). The
&ldquo;Options&rdquo; menu contains the five items discussed below.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3122f2.large.jpg"><img src="3122f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Setting User Account
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Information</b></span>: The user can
create ISP entries, set the default ISP, set auto-dial and re-dial
on disconnect options and the authentication protocol (none, PAP,
PAP-Secrets or CHAT-Secrets). In Figure 2, X-ISP is configured to
connect to any of the three ISPs: Cyberia, Data Management or
IncoNet (actual ISPs in Lebanon) with Cyberia as the default
ISP.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dialing and Logging</b></span>: From
the dialing and logging window, the user controls several options
such as the Dialer Options (number of maximum dialing trials,
inter-dialing delay, maximum wait time for connection to be
established, etc.), and the Manual and Automatic Logging options.
The script section, for both dial-in and call-back, is divided into
Expect and Send sections, as used by the call to the chat command.
Here, the user must enter the script lines employed by chat to
negotiate a successful login for the particular ISP.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Communication Options</b></span>: These
control the settings of the modem device and its properties (Reset
and Init strings, baud rates and flow control), dialing method and
asyncmap, software compression, serial port baud rate and flow
control. All of these options have an initial default value.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3122f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Communication Setup Window
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP/IP Options</b></span>: controls the
settings of dynamic local and remote addresses, netmask and
DNS.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3122f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Setting Up the TCP/IP Options
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paths Setup</b></span>: enables editing
the paths to the <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> daemon, the
location where pppd saves its process ID files, the
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> utility, the
<span   class="bold"><b>xispdial</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xispterm</b></span> utilities, and where XISP
will keep the named pipe node used for communicating with its
components.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3122f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Paths Setup
</p></div></div><p>The &ldquo;Logging&rdquo; menu contains the following two items:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>PTT Editor</b></span>: This form
enables editing of phone company information maintained by X-ISP.
The user can add his local phone company to the compiled list and
set up its rates. This way, when the user retrieves on-line
statistics, he will receive a report of the actual cost.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Statistics</b></span>: This displays
time/cost information and also makes a bar chart of costs for each
period (weekly, monthly and bimonthly).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3122f6.large.jpg"><img src="3122f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

pppd/chat and provides maximum feedback from the dial-in and login
phases on the browser screen. It saves a lot of time compared to
configuring PPP manually. X-ISP has several advantages over manual
configuration:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3122f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Connection in Process
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>X-ISP enhances the user's knowledge of what is
happening while a call is in progress in a graphical way, rather
than the usual scripts that write output to the terminal.</p></li><li><p>X-ISP provides a mechanism to save ISP logs and to
keep track of how many calls you make, their duration and
cost.</p></li><li><p>One major facility is that the user can maintain
two databases: one for the ISPs and the other for the phone
companies (PTTs). This feature allows the user to configure his
machine for more than one ISP and for more than one account with
every ISP.</p></li><li><p>The phone company database supports all (known) PTT
attributes applicable while logging phone-call costs, and saves its
information in a separate file in the subdirectory /.xisplogs in
the user's home directory.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x20fd650"></a>X-ISP Requirements and Installation</h2></div></div><p>X-ISP was developed by Dimitrios P. Bouras and can be
downloaded at no charge from
<a href="http://users.hol.gr/~dbouras" target="_self">http://users.hol.gr/~dbouras/</a>.</p><p>In order to install the X-ISP package on your system, four
requirements must be satisfied:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The ppp-2.2.x package must be installed on the
system.</p></li><li><p>X11R6 (XFree86 version 3.1.2 or newer) must be
installed.</p></li><li><p>The xforms libraries (version 0.88 or newer) are
needed. You can download a copy from either
<a href="http://bloch.phys.uwm.edu/xforms" target="_self">http://bloch.phys.uwm.edu/xforms/</a>
or
<a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms" target="_self">http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms/</a>.</p></li><li><p>A copy of the XPM library (version 3.4 or later) is
also needed.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once these requirements are fulfilled, installation is
straightforward. I have installed X-ISP on several machines
(Slackware 3.4, kernel 2.0.30) by running <b  >make</b>
and <b  >make&nbsp;install</b>. I was surprised I did not
have to re-edit any configuration file or fix file permissions or
anything. It worked perfectly from the first trial. However, in
case you run into trouble, an explanation on solving your
installation problems is in the documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x20fdcd8"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>X-ISP comes with a large amount of technical documentation
discussing implementation issues, security, architecture, and the
interaction between the different components. It also has a good
help facility that guides the user through setting up X-ISP step by
step. Help is also available on-line from the main window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x20fdde0"></a>Final Word</h2></div></div><p>X-ISP is a very well-thought-out tool. It gives us what we
need: a fast way to configure the machine, graphical interface, a
graphical control over the chat scripts, and a way to tracks time
and cost.</p></div></div>
