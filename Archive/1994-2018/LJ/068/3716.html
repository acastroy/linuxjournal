    The whole to-do seems both parochial and silly.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec0580.0xfb8450"></a></h2></div></div><p> There are many folks who worry about
planes falling out of the sky and civilization ending at 00:00:01
on January 1, 2000.
</p><p>Of course, this is the date only for Western Christians. For
Eastern Christians, the calendar is shifted by about two weeks. For
Jews, it's about 240 years until the (next) millennium. For
Moslems, it's also several centuries. So, the whole to-do seems
both parochial and silly. Also, for computer folk, there's the
realization that the calendar isn't a UNIX system: it doesn't begin
with &ldquo;0&rdquo;, so the second millennium must begin on January 1, 2001.
(If you think there was a year 0 between 1 BC and 1 AD, this will
be where you stop reading.)</p><p>However, there <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> problems, and they
are worldwide. Why? Because over the past 50-odd years, chips and
computers have become ubiquitous. Computers don't actually think
very well. Unlike bookkeepers from the Italian Renaissance to the
present, who used two-digit dates and had no problem computing
interest for 1695 to 1705 when they wrote &ldquo;95-05&rdquo;, computers
don't really know how to handle &ldquo;00.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec0580.0xfb8660"></a>So what?</h2></div></div><p>Well, in most cases we just don't know. It appears that the
overwhelming portion of the U.S. power grid has tested okay. But
what if a very small supplier &ldquo;trips&rdquo; something? The grid folks
assured those of us living in Manhattan in 1965 that a massive grid
failure couldn't happen again. There was another less than a decade
later. A few years ago, there was a cascading failure on the West
Coast. So we really aren't sure what will happen.</p><p>On the other hand, there are myriad things each of us can
test: kitchen and household appliances with date chips, for
example. I tested my VCRs, setting the date to December 31, 1999.
In the morning, one had the right time, one was blinking &ldquo;00:00&rdquo;
at me.</p><p>Maybe my coffee maker won't go on, or my bread machine, or
the VCR won't tape the <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>th episode of
something. But none of these is necessary to my life.</p><p>I have confidence in the various phone companies, too. They
have far too much at risk not to have checked things out. And I
know that most electronic switching systems are Y2K safe.</p><p>Doors with time locks may not be. I don't know whether banks
have checked the locks on their doors and their safes as rigorously
as they have checked their accounting machinery. But I know the New
York Stock Exchange is in good shape, as are the large brokerage
houses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec0580.0xfb8920"></a>What About Computers?</h2></div></div><p>If you're running UNIX, time doesn't run out for decades;
well, at least into the 21st century for Linux. DOS 6 and earlier?
Win95? You may be a victim. Windows 98? Well, according to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Agence France Presse</em></span> last February, the French
Directorate for Competition and Prevention of Fraud (DGCCRF) showed
that Windows 98 and Works 4.5 would be unable to recognize the year
2000. According to Marylise Lebranchu, the Minister for Small and
Medium Businesses:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The DGCCRF carried out tests in mid-January on
products which might not work after 2000 and we have proof that
Works 4.5 and Windows 98 will not work. It is extraordinary that a
company which is supposedly at the cutting edge of technology has
sold products which will not work after 2000.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec0580.0xfb8b30"></a>And the Internet?</h2></div></div><p>One of the design basics in the ARPANET, the sire of the
Internet, was that it be both redundant and resilient. Today's Net,
with over 50 million host machines and about 150 million users, is
even more redundant. Many of us &ldquo;live&rdquo; on a frail branch, a mere
twig, a single leaf. We depend upon an ISP&mdash;an enormous one like
UUNET or a small one with perhaps 100 to 200 clients. Many of these
smaller ISPs run older routers.</p><p>Go look at Cisco's site. All the routers currently sold are
Y2K sound. Go back a couple of years: either all are sound, or
there is free software available for download over the Net. If you
go back five years, not only are the routers not Y2K-safe, they
don't have enough memory to be upgraded.</p><p>So I worry that Internet users at some small twigs may lose
their dial-up connections. I worry that some DNS caches may fail or
be corrupted. Most of all, I worry about people's reactions to not
being able to dial up, not being able to see the ball drop in Times
Square from their desktops (as opposed to their TV sets), or not
being able to exchange chat New Year's greetings.</p><p>If one looks at the Net statistics for hurricane Floyd last
September, it's clear the usage spikes came after the hurricane
passed: folks wanted to know &ldquo;How bad was it?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How's uncle
Fred?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>So the big Y2K events may occur before noon in the
continental U.S. on December 31. When it's midnight in Guam, it's 8
AM in New York and 5 AM in Silicon Valley. In the US, we'll have a
lot of warning: from Tokyo, Melbourne, Singapore, etc., as the hour
marches around the globe.</p><p>I don't think we should worry. There may be glitches and
minor failures, but it won't be the end of the world. Penguins will
survive.</p></div></div>
