various reasons. From testing to storing Internet downloads and
archiving, I always needed more disk space. When I began looking at
the available removable media devices, I wasn't impressed. Most
contained only a few hundred megabytes and were very expensive.
Then I came across the ORB. The ORB is both inexpensive and
contains a good amount of data (2.2GB per disk, which can compress
up to 6GB). A month later, I was buying a parallel port ORB device
and two disks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x1053b30"></a>Device Information</h2></div></div><p>The Castlewood ORB is a device capable of supporting
removable disks containing 2.2GB of data. The ORB comes in several
versions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Internal IDE</p></li><li><p>Internal SCSI</p></li><li><p>External SCSI</p></li><li><p>External Parallel</p></li></ul></div><p>The ORB is advertised as a good way to store important data,
have portable information, store digital images and other media,
back up a hard disk and store Internet downloads. The manual
specifies that a Pentium 100 or better system is required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x1053fa8"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>I bought the ORB from one of the on-line resellers and
received it in less than a week. The ORB box is quite large and
contains the ORB drive, a disk full of utilities, an interface
cable, a power supply, a user manual and an installation floppy.
The drive is nice and looks modern on a desk. It is black with a
small door for the disk on the front. The ORB power supply is like
any other power supply, appearing very common. The interface cable
is very short (about two feet), and you cannot use a normal printer
cable to link the drive to the PC. The drive has an output port to
connect a printer. The manual recommends that no other parallel
device be used with the ORB and the printer.</p><p>One thing I found out is that even if they include a
removable disk in the package, you actually need to buy another one
since the included disk has 1.6GB of tools on it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x1054108"></a>Included Software</h2></div></div><p>The installation floppy contains drivers for various systems,
including Windows 98, Windows 3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and DOS. The
included media has the following Windows tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ORB Tools: a set of tools and utilities used to
manage the drive, eject a disk, scan the drive and other similar
functions.</p></li><li><p>1-Click Backup: a full system backup can be done
with this utility by right clicking on the ORB's drive
letter.</p></li><li><p>Advanced Backup: this full suite of backup tools is
for professional users.</p></li><li><p>Duplicator: this tool allows you to duplicate
multiple ORB disks.</p></li><li><p>tracker: tracks your files on all your
disks.</p></li><li><p>Rescue: this small utility lets you restore your
boot drive in emergency situations.</p></li></ul></div><p>The disks come formatted in FAT16, which is readable and
writable by Linux, DOS and Windows. They can be partitioned and
re-formatted like normal hard disks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x1054738"></a>Windows Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation in Windows was very easy. When inserting the
driver's floppy, you can install the drive in less than 30 seconds.
The ORB device will then appear as a drive letter, seen from
Windows as a removable hard disk. Installing the tools provides all
kinds of interesting functions, including backups and a
software-based eject button.</p><p>One thing I noticed is that when the RealPlayer is running
and I insert a disk in the drive, then try to access it from
Windows Explorer, it hangs the system. This may be a bug in the ORB
driver, the RealPlayer or both.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x1054898"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Inexpensive</p></li><li><p>Easy to use</p></li><li><p>Large storage size</p></li><li><p>Lots of software</p></li><li><p>Works with Linux, OS/2, DOS and Windows</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x104b5a0"></a>The Bad</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Unreponsive when writing large files</p></li><li><p>Much slower than an IDE drive</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x104b808"></a>Linux Installation</h2></div></div><p>The Linux installation was also easy. The ORB device acts
like an OnSpec device, which is supported by Linux. Here is a quick
installation guide, followed by the steps.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/modprobe paride
/sbin/modprobe on26
/sbin/modprobe pd
mknod /dev/pda5 b 45 5
mount -tmsdos /dev/pda5 /mnt/orb
</pre><p>The first step is to load the necessary modules. Three
modules are required, and unless you link them in your kernel, you
need to load them when you boot up. The first module is
<span   class="bold"><b>paride</b></span>, the parallel driver which
handles IDE devices. The second is the OnSpec26 driver, which
should find the drive. The <span   class="bold"><b>pd</b></span>
module should load the disk.
</p><p>Once the drive and disk are found, you need to mount the
disk. By default, the media is formatted as an extended FAT16
partition. The first four partitions in a Linux file system are
&ldquo;primary&rdquo;; number five and up are called &ldquo;extended&rdquo;. This means
you need to create a device named pda5. The
<span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> command will do just that.
The <span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> command will mount the
partition in /mnt/orb, assuming you have created that
directory.</p><p>If you have problems mounting the drive, you may want to look
in your syslog files. These should contain report messages from the
module's loading and tell you what is wrong.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x104bbd0"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>The first time I used it, I noticed how silent it was. You
can't even hear it write to the disk. When you first insert a disk,
you hear the same sound as when you boot a system, and the BIOS
loads the hard drive. When the disk is loaded, you can mount it and
read/write directly to the disk.</p><p>I noticed two problems when working with the ORB. First, when
the system has large files to write to a removable ORB media, it
becomes very occupied and unresponsive during the time it is
writing to the disk. I am assuming this is because it has to write
via the parallel port, and the system needs to send the data at a
fixed speed and compression.</p><p>The other thing I noticed is the speed, which while better
than every other removable media I have tried in the past, is still
not as good as an internal IDE drive. The 2MB/sec advertised is the
burst speed. I found the write speed to be around 100 to 200KB/sec,
transmitting around 10MB in a minute.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5b580.0x104bd88"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>With its low cost, ease of use and included software, the ORB
is a good product to buy. Now I use it to do all of my local
backups and store important archive files which I may need in the
future, such as Netscape Communicator and Word Perfect 8.</p><p>I think the Castlewood ORB is the best removable media yet,
and it is great that it works in most popular operating systems
including Windows, OS/2, DOS and Linux. I would like to see
Castlewood provide formal support for Linux and their web site
advertise the fact that ORB works on Linux.</p></div></div>
