    How would you like your screen to look on start up? Here's
    how to make it look your way.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e63f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;What's an XDM screen? Is this more
cryptic Linux geek speak?&rdquo; Well, yes, but I'm going to make it
easy to understand, so you too can speak more like a Linux geek. If
you are running the X Window System and have your system set up to
boot straight into X and display the box asking for your login name
and password, you are already running XDM. If you are running X
using the <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> command from a
shell prompt, you aren't running XDM now&mdash;but you will soon be.
</p><p>XDM has features other than the ones relating to the xlogin
box. These other features are useful only if you are running X on
multiple screens or machines. If you are interested, read the
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> man page. In this article, I
will focus on basic cosmetic changes like the background image,
programs to be displayed while waiting for a login, colors and
fonts used in the login box and the size and position of the login
box.</p><p>I will assume you have X set up and running correctly. If you
don't have X working, please consult the documentation that came
with your Linux distribution.</p><p>If you already have XDM up and running, you can skip ahead to
the section on customizing XDM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e66b8"></a>Setting Up XDM</h2></div></div><p>Setting up XDM requires you to change the run level of your
system. The run level controls which mode the system is running in
when it is rebooted. It can run in single user mode, multiuser mode
without networking, multiuser mode with networking and multiuser
mode with XDM running. My system is Red Hat 5.1 and it uses run
level 3 for normal multiuser operation and run level 5 for XDM
operation (multiuser, plus starting X at boot time). Edit your
/etc/inittab file as the root user to change the run level of the
system. First, make sure the XDM run level exists in /etc/inittab.
It should look something like this and is usually located near the
end of the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Run XDM in run level 5
x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
</pre><p>This is the entry from Red Hat 5.1. Slackware, Debian, SuSE
and other Linux distributions with X should be similar. The run
level number is 5 in this case, but may be different in your
distribution.
</p><p>You can test the XDM run level by typing <b  >init
5</b>. If the login box appears and everything looks okay,
you can change the default initlevel for bootup or experiment with
the XDM changes without rebooting your system. If you don't want
XDM to start at boot time, skip ahead to the next section.</p><p>Make a backup copy of the /etc/inittab file before you change
anything. Rename it to something like inittab.bak.1, then look for
the initdefault line, which is usually near the start of the
/etc/inittab file. Since you are not yet running XDM, yours
probably looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault:
</pre><p>To make your system start XDM at boot time, you change the 3
in this line to equal the number in the XDM run level line. In my
case, I changed the 3 to a 5. Reboot your system, and a gray screen
with a box in the middle asking for a user name and password will
appear. You can log in and make sure everything is running okay,
but that isn't necessary to complete this tutorial.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e6a28"></a>Customizing XDM</h2></div></div><p>Now that XDM is up and running, we can start making changes.
We will be switching between a text-mode login and the XDM screen.
To get to the text mode console, press
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-F1</b>;
to get back to the XDM screen, press
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-F7</b>.
With some distributions, you may have to use
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-F6</b>
for the XDM screen.</p><p>Change to text mode and log in as root. Change directories to
/usr/lib/X11/xdm and look at the files present in this directory.
These files control the behavior of your system when XDM is started
and a user logs in using XDM. The files we are concerned with
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Xsetup (or Xsetup_0), which sets up the XDM
screen</p></li><li><p>Xresources, which controls the behavior of the
xlogin widget</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e6e48"></a>Changing the Background Color</h2></div></div><p>Let's start by changing the background color to something
other than gray. You can use any program which can display an image
or color on the background, which is sometimes called the root
window. One program included with the X distribution is
<span   class="bold"><b>xsetroot</b></span>. Edit the Xsetup file and
comment out any programs that may already be setting the background
image, like xbanner, xv or xsetroot. Add the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot -solid steelblue
</pre><p>Color names like steelblue are defined in the
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt file. This maps color names to the actual
Red/Green/Blue color settings, making things more readable. If you
use a color name that has spaces in it, you need to enclose them in
quotes, e.g., <b  >"navy blue"</b>.
</p><p>Save the Xsetup file and switch back to the XDM display by
using
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-F7</b>
(or <b  >F6</b>, depending on which virtual console the X
server is using for its display). Then restart XDM by pressing
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;backspace&lt;H&gt;</b>.
Note: do not use the <b  >&lt;H&gt;del&lt;H&gt;</b> key.
It will reboot the whole system instead of just restarting
XDM.</p><p>You should now have a nice, solid steel-blue background. You
can experiment with different colors until you find one that you
like.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e72c0"></a>Changing the Background Pattern</h2></div></div><p>A bitmap can be used to tile (copied over and over to cover
the whole display) a simple two-color image onto the background
instead of a solid color. There should be a collection of bitmaps
in /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. You can also create your own using the
bitmap program included with X windows. Try changing the xsetroot
line to this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot -bitmap\
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/xsnow
</pre><p>Restart XDM as before, and you should now have a nice winter
scene. You can change the foreground and background color with the
bitmap by adding the <b  >-fg</b> and
<b  >-bg</b> options and specifying a color. Try changing
it to this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot -bitmap\
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/xsnow -fg blue -bg yellow
</pre>


Not the most wonderful colors for snow, but you get the idea. The
colors recognized by the <b  >-fg</b> and
<b  >-bg</b> options are the same as the ones in the
rgb.txt file discussed above.
</p><p>You can also tile color bitmaps stored in the xpm format. The
<span   class="bold"><b>xpmroot</b></span> program is used for this.
Change the xsetroot line to something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/xpmroot\
/usr/include/X11/pixmaps/file.xpm
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e7738"></a>Displaying a Background Image</h2></div></div><p>Now that we can display colors and tiled bitmaps on the
background, it is time to display a picture on the background. To
do this, I use a shareware graphics program called
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>. You can get it from the xv
home page at
<a href="http://www.trilon.com/xv" target="_self">http://www.trilon.com/xv/</a>,
or it may be included with your Linux distribution. Remember, this
is shareware, and you should support the author by sending him $25
if you find his program useful.</p><p>I have chosen to use xv, but any program capable of
displaying an image on the background can be used. For xv, you tell
it to display the image centered on the background. You also want
it to exit immediately after displaying the image; otherwise, XDM
will hang until the xv program is exited manually.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/xv -root -rmode 5 -quit\
/root/.gromit01.jpg
</pre><p>I use this to put a picture in the center of the display. To
view your changes, save the Xsetup file and press
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;_&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-F7</b>
to switch back to the XDM screen. Press
<b  >&lt;H&gt;ctrl&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;alt&lt;H&gt;-&lt;H&gt;backspace&lt;H&gt;</b>
to restart the X server. You should now see your image in the
center of the screen, covered by the login box.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> supports several other
placement options using the <b  >-rmode</b> command. You
can see a list of these options by typing
<b  >xv&nbsp;-rmode&nbsp;-1</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13e7bb0"></a>Displaying Random Images</h2></div></div><p><a href="3325l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>With the help of a simple Perl script, you can display a
random image on the background each time XDM is run. Listing 1 is a
simplified version of a script written by Scott Scriven,
toykeeper@cheerful.com.</p><p>Type in this program or download it from
<a href="../listings/068/3325.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue68/3325.tgz</a>.
and save it as /usr/local/bin/bkgd. Make sure execute permissions
are set by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod ugo+x /usr/local/bin/bkgd
</pre><p>You may also have to change the path to xv and
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> to match your local setup.
Including the absolute paths in the script ensures it will work
correctly, even when the <b  >$PATH</b> environment
variable isn't set.
</p><p>To load a random background, change the xv line in Xsetup to
usr/local/bin/bkgd instead. Create a /usr/lib/X11/backgrounds
directory and fill it with your favorite images. A couple of good
places to look for background images are
<a href="http://www.digitalblasphemy.com" target="_self">http://www.digitalblasphemy.com/</a>
and
<a href="http://ipix.yahoo.com" target="_self">http://ipix.yahoo.com/</a>.</p><p>Listing 2 is a working Xsetup file with the intermediate
steps commented out with &ldquo;#&rdquo; characters.</p><p><a href="3325l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13dea18"></a>Customizing the Login Box</h2></div></div><p>Now we want to customize the xlogin box using the
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources file. This file is also used for
configuring other XDM widgets like the chooser, but we aren't going
to deal with these other options here&mdash;see the XDM man page to
learn about them.</p><p>We can move the xlogin box, resize it, change its color, its
fonts and what it says. I have moved mine into the lower-right
corner and made it as small as I can, so that it doesn't cover up
the background image.</p><p>The XDM xlogin widget uses X resources to specify these
settings. They are all stored in the Xresources file and are read
by XDM each time it restarts. A list of the available options,
taken from the XDM man page, is shown in &ldquo;Xresources Options&rdquo;. I
will go through each option and explain its use.</p><p>I have ignored several more advanced xlogin resources, some
of which may appear in the Xresources file. It is safe to leave
them alone&mdash;the defaults set when you installed X should work fine.
The XDM man page contains full descriptions of each option, if you
want to experiment with them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13dec28"></a>Move and Resize the xlogin Box</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >.width</b>, <b  >.height</b>,
<b  >.x</b> and <b  >.y</b> settings can be
used to set the size and screen position of the xlogin box, or you
can use <b  >.geometry</b> to specify all of these at
once. Let's move the login box to the lower-right corner and make
it 300 by 250 pixels. The screen coordinates to be used start with
0,0 in the upper-left corner, and the coordinates of the
lower-right corner will depend on your screen resolution. But X has
another way to specify coordinates: <b  >-0,-0</b> is the
lower-right corner of the display, no matter what the screen size.
Add this line to the Xresources file, near the other
<b  >xlogin*</b> definitions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*geometry: 300x250-0-0
</pre><p>Save the file and restart the x server as you did after
changing the background image. Your login box should now fit snugly
into the lower-right corner of the display, revealing more of your
background image.
</p><p>Now we can change the colors. There are five resources
relating to color in the above table. First, change the default
foreground and background colors for the box using the
<b  >xlogin*foreground</b> and
<b  >.background</b> settings. Let's make it black on
blue:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*foreground: black
xlogin*background: steelblue
</pre><p>Save and restart the X server to make sure your changes have
taken effect. The greeting and login prompt did not change color,
because you haven't changed them yet. You must specify each
individual color you want to change. The
<b  >.greetColor</b> setting is the greeting that is
displayed at the top of the box. <b  >.promptColor</b> is
the login: and password: prompt color, as well as the text you
enter for your user name. <b  >.failColor</b> is used for
when the user name or password entered is invalid.
</p><p>Try out these settings:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*foreground:  black
xlogin*background:  steelblue
xlogin*greetColor:  white
xlogin*promptColor: grey
xlogin*failColor:   red
</pre><p>Not a terribly inspiring color scheme, but better than black
on white. Play around with it until you find the colors you like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ee580.0x13df410"></a>Changing the xlogin Fonts</h2></div></div><p>The resources that control the four fonts we want to change
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >xlogin*font</b>: used for displaying
the typed-in user name</p></li><li><p><b  >xlogin*greetFont</b>: used to
display the greeting</p></li><li><p><b  >xlogin*promptFont</b>: used to
display the prompts username: and password:</p></li><li><p><b  >xlogin*failFont</b>: used for
displaying that the login failed</p></li></ul></div><p>Fonts under X are difficult to deal with. They have an
abundance of options and modifiers, most of which are never used.
The <span   class="bold"><b>xfontsel</b></span> program can make font
selection much easier. Just browse through the fonts, selecting the
font style, size and attributes you want. Then click on the select
button and paste the font string into the Xresources file using
your middle mouse button, or both mouse buttons at once if you have
a two-button mouse. Add these lines to your Xresources file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*font:\
 -*-courier-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
xlogin*greetFont:\
 -*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
xlogin*promptFont:\
 -*-lucidatypewriter-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
xlogin*failFont:\
 -*-times-bold-i-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</pre>


Experiment with the different fonts and sizes until you find
something you like.

the four prompts associated with the xlogin widget.
<b  >.greeting</b> can be set to
<b  >CLIENTHOST</b> and will display the full host name
of the system it is running on. The <b  >.namePrompt</b>
value is displayed to ask for the user name,
<b  >.passwdPrompt</b> asks for the password, and
<b  >.fail</b> is displayed when an unsuccessful login
occurs. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xlogin*greeting:         Welcome!
xlogin*namePrompt:       Name:\040
xlogin*passwdPrompt:     Password:
xlogin*fail:             !WRONG!

display a nifty looking analog clock. Add it to your XDM screen by
inserting this line in your Xsetup file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xclock -hl white
-hd white -bg black -fg white\ -geometry 100x100+0+0 &amp;
</pre><p>This will display an analog clock of moderate size in the
upper-left corner of the screen. The clock may stay running, even
after a user has logged in.
</p><p>Well, that's about it for the basic customization of XDM.
There are many things to play with, and hopefully I have given you
a good framework with which to begin experimenting. No two users
have the same tastes, so it may take some time before you finally
get the look and feel you want.</p><p><a href="3325s1.html" target="_self">Xresources Options</a></p></div></div>
