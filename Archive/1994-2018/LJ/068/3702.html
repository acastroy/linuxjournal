changed the way we e-mail. Web-based e-mail has numerous advantages
over traditional e-mail: access from any web terminal, no need for
e-mail client software (such as Pine, Elm or Mutt) and
multi-platform support (users have the same interface on Linux as
on any other platform). MailStudio 2000 is a web-based e-mail
server from 3R Soft for Linux, Solaris, HP and DEC that provides
web-based e-mail service for users. It is accessible through web
browsers such as Netscape and also through POP3-based mail programs
such as Eudora. It can even be implemented on top of existing POP3
servers to provide a local interface. Unlike many web-based e-mail
servers, MailStudio 2000 apparently aims to be a quality,
functionality-oriented e-mail utility, rather than a commercial
excuse for running advertisements (though you can, if you must, put
ads on MailStudio 2000). Three main elements of a web-based e-mail
server are its interface to the users, its interface to the
administrator and the technical features of the server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24a9ad8"></a>The User Interface</h2></div></div><p>The uniform user interface offers a number of traditional
e-mail features, such as mailboxes and address books, as well as
some things which are quite modern (or even trendy), such as the
ability to send e-mail as HTML with italics and graphics and all of
that bother. (This tends to annoy people, actually.) By default,
MailStudio keeps Inbox, Sent and Trash folders, and you can
apparently add as many as you like, which will be kept in the
user's folder menu. The Options folder contains entries for
changing your preferences, folders, external mail configuration
(for POP3 servers), address book, signature, user information and
password. There is also a Question &amp; Answer board for the
system and a User Search function for finding others. The last
option is &ldquo;Log off&rdquo; which kills the encrypted cookies used for
user authentication.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24a9be0"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fast</p></li><li><p>extremely easy</p></li><li><p>flexible</p></li><li><p>it works</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24a9fa8"></a>The Bad</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a bit pricy</p></li><li><p>somewhat insecure</p></li><li><p>flickers</p></li></ul></div><p>In order to use MailStudio 2000, a user must have Java and
cookies enabled. In addition, it seems to take a while to load,
with a lot of flickering during initial contact. The software is
constantly being developed, so maybe this flickering will go away
soon. Everything else is simple, like any other mailer. People who
don't like command lines, <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, or
typing in general will like this entirely graphical user interface.
MailStudio 2000 used to have multi-layer folders and address books,
which I think is a neat idea, but they eliminated multi-layers
because they weren't entirely cooperative with frames.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3702f2.large.jpg"><img src="3702f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. A Picture of the User

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24aa580"></a>The Administrator Interface</h2></div></div><p>From an administrator's viewpoint, MailStudio 2000 has a
number of good qualities. Installation is easy, and should take no
more than a few minutes. Likewise, starting and stopping the server
is quite simple with <span   class="bold"><b>start</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>stop</b></span>. Administrators can change
the user interface just by changing the HTML files, making all
sorts of customization possible, as well as advertisements if you
really want them. (Well, it wouldn't be the Web without ads.) The
client/server model of MailStudio is based on open standards, so it
integrates easily with other software. As an example, user database
and mail files can be automatically backed up by
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>; the manual gives the cron
entries for doing this. For normal management of these user
database and mail files, MailStudio's intended interface is a web
based menu which is accessed by logging in as sysop. The interface
provides menus for user management, application, admission and
admin's (system) preferences. Of these, the administrator's
preferences menu has the important, system-wide, technical
parameters.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24aa9a0"></a>Technical Features</h2></div></div><p>The server has a number of functions and features to help it
deal with the complicated issues which arise in something seemingly
as simple as web-mail. Not all mail is processed following the same
protocol, so in addition to the standard Sendmail and SMTP,
MailStudio is also able to support POP servers and retrieve mail
from them.</p><p>Security, such as it is, is achieved by way of cookies, which
are encrypted with MD5, and customers can order SSL services as
well. The server supports numerous standards such as MIME
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), multipurpose and dynamic
HTML, ISO2022, Quoted Printable, BASE 64, uuencode, two-byte
character sets and multiple-language environments. Embedded in the
system is the CodeBase 6.3 database for dealing with all the
data.</p><p>Overall, the server is flexible, adaptable and generally
cooperative. For example, you can assign MailStudio to a specific
port in order to avoid conflicts with a web site you are already
running, and you can implement virtual mail hosts to achieve
multi-domain support. In terms of resource consumption, MailStudio
allegedly can support over one million users and can deliver fast
service even during heavy loads. (I could not exactly verify this
point, so we'll have to take their word for it.) The system is
self-contained, with safeguards, simple methods and standard error
procedures, and requires very little maintenance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24aab58"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>Holistically speaking, the problem with networks is security.
Every packet of information usually travels through several
machines, and all it takes is a packet sniffer at any point along
the way and your data can be intercepted. This is a reason not to
send unencrypted credit-card information over the Internet. (This
is also why we want the U.S. government to allow stronger
encryption.) However, when it comes to dealing with sending
passwords over the Internet, it's a complicated problem to fix. For
this reason, web-based e-mail has always been vulnerable to
security breaches, whether through accessing a page directly to
bypass login or through packet sniffers routing out people's
passwords. Cookies have largely put an end to the former problem,
but the latter is still with us. Fortunately, crackers (as Eric
Raymond likes to call them) don't have too much interest in reading
other people's web-based e-mail. Still, at login, your user name
and password are sent unencrypted across the network to the
MailStudio server, as are the e-mail messages you send and receive.
Although this is the same situation as with TELNET or almost
anything else, it's not safe and something must be done (hence
secure shells). 3R says it can purchase and implement an SSL
package from a third party and integrate it into MailStudio in
order to have encrypted first-pass user name and password data. I
think 3R should just write SSL into MailStudio since it is, after
all, an open protocol. Maybe it'll show up in a later version; I
certainly hope so. If systems were secure in the first place, fewer
curious people would be in prison, and script kiddies wouldn't seem
so annoying.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b1580.0x24aac60"></a>MailStudio of the Future</h2></div></div><p>Even though it seems like a simple task, implementing a
web-based e-mail server is complicated due to the numerous
protocols, standards and platforms. Because of this, 3R
concentrated on performing one task simply and doing it well. Much
effort was put into making this software run easily, and I think it
is a success. I'm not a web type (three cheers for Lynx), and I
managed to have it up and running in less than ten minutes.</p><p>One strange quality of MailStudio 2000 is that the
advertisement 3R sent with it didn't exactly correspond with the
features on the server. The reason? MailStudio is still being
improved. Now that the base product exists with everything working,
3R can concentrate on improving the features, such as search
routines or user management. I have been told by 3R that their
later releases will have all sorts of neat things. An on-line demo
at
<a href="http://www.mailstudio.com" target="_self">http://www.mailstudio.com/</a>
shows the system and demonstrates the current features.</p><p>I was definitely impressed with MailStudio 2000's ease of
use. While I am concerned about the insecure first pass of user
name and password, and the flickering during the first screen load,
it seems to be quite resource-minimal. One strange thing I noticed
is that all e-mail I receive from MailStudio comes with paragraphs
formatted as single lines, which is a bit weird. Still, with
web-based products so easy to use, it's not hard to understand how
the Web has become so immensely popular and populated. MailStudio
is more expensive than I'd like (which means it costs more than
Apache), but I suppose if you have the resources to run a web site,
perhaps you can afford the price&mdash;still, ouch.</p><p>MailStudio 2000 is targeted not only at free e-mail providers
but at educational and commercial organizations, Internet service
providers and government and public institutions. It received five
Golden Penguins from TUCOWS and is listed as a Sun Microsystems
software solution. You can download a trial version (which supports
five users or so) from
<a href="http://www.3rsoft.com" target="_self">http://www.3rsoft.com/</a>.
It is Y2K compliant (well, wouldn't it be fun to have a product
named MailStudio 2000 that wasn't Y2K compatible?) and it just so
happens I'm running it successfully from a VArStation in which the
BIOS clock thinks it's the year 2036 (though server problems will
arise in 2038). If you're looking for a web-based e-mail server for
your Linux box, definitely take a look at MailStudio. It's already
very neat, and I'm told the next version will be a total web-based
e-mail solution.</p></div></div>
