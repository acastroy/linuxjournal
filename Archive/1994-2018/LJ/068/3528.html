    Integrating Linux into a large-scale production network
    running SPARCs and Windows.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc9580.0x1dc1500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux has come a long way in these past
few years, no longer a geek toy and well on its way to being a
mainstream operating system. Linus Torvalds, with tongue firmly
planted in cheek, is striving for world domination; however, one of
the more intriguing strengths of Linux is its friendly and fruitful
coexistence with other systems, UNIX or not. In fact, its
standards-based approach is one of my favorite ways of
distinguishing between it and certain commercial products.
</p><p>This being said, I would like to present some experiences
with integrating Linux machines into a production computer network
of over 1000 nodes, divided into about two-thirds SPARCs running
Sun Solaris and one-third PCs running one of the variety of
software packages emanating from Redmond, WA.</p><p>Any large UNIX site usually employs the operating system's
easy yet effective mechanisms for maintaining a large number of
users working on an equally large number of machines. For Linux to
participate in such a network, it needs to be able to participate
in or even provide any of these services. At our site, these
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NIS: Sun's Network Information Services, formerly
called Yellow Pages. This is a well-proven mechanism to distribute
any kind of information that can be represented as lists, such as
user accounts, passwords and printer definitions.</p></li><li><p>NFS: the Network File System. This allows mounting
of remote file systems, typically with a mix of static and
automatic mounts. The former are configured on a per-machine basis
and the latter are distributed via NIS maps.</p></li><li><p>Unified login scripts: a carefully set up and
maintained web of shell scripts, providing users with the required
settings to work with their respective applications. This
eliminates the need for each user to hack together her own
environment with all the support implications.</p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, it is almost self-evident that a Linux box
should be able to access networked or server-based printers via the
LPR protocol as well as utilize all other communication protocols
like HTTP, NNTP, SMTP or FTP. Linux has a well-deserved reputation
for being an excellent performer in this respect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc9580.0x1dc1978"></a>The Information Source: Enabling NIS</h2></div></div><p>A three-step approach lets a Linux machine participate in an
NIS domain, beginning with the installation of the necessary
software. In the case of the Red Hat 5.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
distributions, these come in two RPM
packages&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>ypbind</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>yptools</b></span>. The former provides the
ypbind executable, which must run on any NIS client as a daemon,
and provides communication with the NIS server. The latter contains
various NIS-related tools for querying NIS tables
(<span   class="bold"><b>ypcat</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ypmatch</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>yppoll</b></span>) and maintaining the client
configuration (<span   class="bold"><b>ypwhich</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ypset</b></span>).</p><p>Next, the server-side configuration is modified to let the
new NIS client participate in the domain. NIS has only basic
security mechanisms, with a common one being the &ldquo;securenets&rdquo;
list enumerating the networks considered secure to participate in a
domain. If your Linux box lives in a different subnet than your
other UNIX boxes, make sure that network is present in your
server's securenets list (commonly located in /var/yp/securenets on
a Sun server).</p><p>The final hurdle is the client-side configuration. First of
all, the ypbind daemon needs to know the NIS domain name (another
security precaution, although a rather fragile one). This is set in
the file /etc/yp.conf, together with either an NIS server name or
the instruction to broadcast for a server. The file needs to
contain only a single line in this format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
domain
</pre><p>The server bigboy.my.net must have an entry in the hosts
database, /etc/hosts.
</p><p>Now the NIS domain name needs to be set. This can be
accomplished via the <b  >domainname
<i><tt>my.NIS.domain</tt></i></b> command. To make
this setting persist even after a reboot, the domain name should
also be entered into the system's network configuration, in the
case of Red Hat: /etc/sysconfig/network:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DOMAINNAME=
</pre><p>After creating a directory /var/yp/binding for ypbind to
store binding information in, ypbind can be started via its script:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ypbind start.
</p><p>Next, we have to let the system know to actually use NIS to
resolve things like hostnames, user IDs and passwords. To do this,
edit the file /etc/nsswitch.conf and change the corresponding lines
for each service with which you would like to use NIS, e.g.:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
passwd:     files nis
shadow:     files nis
group:      files nis
hosts:      nis files dns
automount:  files nis
</pre><p>In the above examples, the login program trying to
authenticate a user will consult /etc/nsswitch.conf, see the
sequence <b  >files&nbsp;nis</b> and look for the
information in the respective files. Upon failure, it will query
the NIS service for the user's password and shadow entries. If this
also fails, the login is denied. The reason to have the entry
listed as <b  >files&nbsp;nis</b> is that the root user
is normally not defined in NIS (this is considered a security
hole). In the case of a network problem, looking in the local
passwd/shadow files first lets root log in without further
problems.
</p><p>This is basically it. Once the file is edited and ypbind is
running correctly (verify this by looking for suspicious messages
in /var/log/messages and in the corresponding file on the NIS
server), your machine is part of the NIS domain. Of course, you can
reboot if that makes you feel better; it also allows you to test
that the system will come up with the correct configuration.</p><p>You can verify ypbind's connection to the server (a
&ldquo;binding&rdquo; in NIS parlance) using the
<span   class="bold"><b>ypwhich</b></span> command. You can also
manually look up information: the command <b  >ypmatch joe
passwd</b> will show Joe's entry from the NIS password
map.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc9580.0x1dc2370"></a>The Net: Enabling NFS</h2></div></div><p>Now that NIS is working, let's attend to NFS. Depending on
who you listen to, NFS is either the evil beast or the magic bullet
to all your user data-related problems. In my opinion, NFS makes a
large network with huge amounts of user data easy and transparent
to set up, but it comes with a massive performance penalty common
to all networked file systems. Count on NFS access being on the
order of ten times slower than local hard disk file access. Slow or
not, large sites simply can't live without NFS.</p><p>That said, setting up an NFS client basically follows the
same steps as for the NIS client: software installation, server
side configuration and client configuration changes.</p><p>NFS requires a kernel built with support for it, presumably
as a kernel module, but you can compile it into the kernel itself
if you wish. If your kernel does not yet have NFS support, you need
to enable it under &ldquo;Filesystems&rdquo;. Go to your kernel source
directory (most likely /usr/src/linux) and type <b  >make
xconfig</b> or <b  >make menuconfig</b>. Obviously,
to use NFS, the kernel needs to have network support enabled. After
compiling and installing the NFS module, your system has all the
software it needs. I'd suggest you install one piece of optional
software, though, which is
<span   class="bold"><b>showmount</b></span>. Look for a package
called something like nfs*client* on your distribution
CD-ROM.</p><p>On the NFS server, there is usually a file stating which file
systems are exported. Depending on the flavor of UNIX, it can be
called /etc/exports (SunOS, Linux, *BSD), /etc/dfs/dfstab (Solaris,
other System V variants), or something completely different. An
OS-independent way of finding that information is to run the
showmount command against the NFS server, e.g., <b  >showmount
-e</b>. This will list the exported file systems and also the
machines or groups of machines allowed to mount them.</p><p>Large sites usually have a need to manage machines in groups.
For example, all users' desktop workstations should be able to
mount any of the home directories, whereas only servers might be
allowed to mount CDs from a networked jukebox. In NIS, this
mechanism is provided by the netgroup map, and chances are the
showmount command will list only the netgroups allowed to access
specific exports. A sample output would be</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/ftp      (everyone)
/homedesktops
/var/mail      mailservers
</pre><p><b  >everyone</b> is a special name denoting every
machine, while <b  >desktops</b> and
<b  >mailservers</b> are netgroups. Executing
<pre     class="programlisting">
ypmatch -k desktops netgroup
</pre>


might produce:
<pre     class="programlisting">
desktops: penguin, turkey, heron
</pre>


For your Linux machine to be able to access the /home, NFS share
requires it to belong to the <b  >desktops</b> netgroup.
Otherwise, the server will deny access.
</p><p>Once your server lets you in, the last obstacle is
advertising the NFS exports to your client. The easiest way to
handle this is a permanent mount entry in your /etc/fstab, such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bigboy:/export/home     /home   nfs     0 0
</pre><p>This way, /home would be hard-mounted on each boot. While
this approach certainly works very well, it has limitations. At our
site, we have a mount point for each user's home directory; e.g.,
/home/joe for Joe and /home/sue for Sue. With 1200+ users
distributed across ten file servers, hard-mounting each directory
would require much housekeeping, and a server replacement or
elimination would be a major headache.
</p><p>Fortunately, there is an elegant way around this, called the
<span   class="bold"><b>automounter</b></span>. This enterprising
little daemon watches a set of mount points specified in files for
access by the operating system. Once an access is detected, the
automount daemon tries to mount the export belonging to the mount
point. Other than a slight delay, neither applications nor users
notice a difference from a regular mount. As might be expected, the
automounter will release (<span   class="bold"><b>umount</b></span>)
a mounted file system after a configurable period of
inactivity.</p><p>To make use of the automounter, install the autofs package
and look at the files it installed in the /etc/auto directory. The
first and most important is /etc/auto.master which lists each mount
point to be supervised by the automounter and its associated map,
usually named /etc/auto.<span   class="emphasis"><em>mountpoint</em></span>. Each of
these maps follows the basic schema set forth in
/etc/auto.misc:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
d       -fstype=iso9660,ro,user :/dev/cdrom
fd      -fstype=auto,user :/dev/fd0
</pre><p>In this example, /misc/cd is mounted with the usual options
associated with a CD drive on /misc/cd, whereas the floppy
currently in drive /dev/fd0 is mounted on /misc/fd. Note that the
mounts will not occur until the directory is accessed, e.g., by
doing <b  >ls /misc/cd</b>, and the automounter will
automatically create each of the mount points listed in the file.
</p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo;, you say, &ldquo;now, what's all that got to do with NFS
and NIS?&rdquo; Well, the automount maps are actually lists which can be
maintained on the NIS server and distributed to the clients. For
example, a typical NIS map named auto.home would look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
joe     bigboy:/export/home/2/joe
sue     beanbox:/export/home/sue
</pre><p>Here, then, is the reason to have the huge number of mount
points mentioned earlier. If Joe changes jobs and joins the finance
department, his home directory can be moved to beanbox. His new
entry would then read:
<pre     class="programlisting">
joe     beanbox:/export/home/joe
</pre>


but the mount point on his desktop machine is still /home/joe. In
other words, even though he changed to another server, he does not
need to adapt any of the environment settings, application data
paths or shell scripts he might have. Not convinced? Type
<b  >grep&nbsp;$HOME&nbsp;$HOME/.*</b> to see how many
instances of your home path are actually saved everywhere.
</p><p>If, during NIS configuration, you edited your
/etc/nsswitch.conf to contain the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
automount:  files nis
</pre><p>the automounter will read its startup files from
/etc/auto.master. After that, it will query the NIS server for an
NIS map named auto.master and will process the entries accordingly.
Thus, the above change for user Joe needs to be made only one time
on one system (the NIS master), and it will be known to all
clients. No entries to forget, no conflicting client
configurations. How's that for efficiency?

our Linux box be a part of the enterprise network. Login scripts,
on the other hand, are to be understood on an administrative level.
Sites with only a few users may have no need for them, but if you
have to support hundreds or even thousands of users of varying
degrees of computer literacy and quite likely in different physical
locations, you start to look at the situation differently.</p><p>Two of the most widely used shells, tcsh and bash, as well as
their precursors csh and sh, utilize a two-step setup procedure.
Without going into too much detail, files called .login and
.profile are executed on login. Afterwards and on each invocation
of a non-login shell (opening a new xterm window), a file called
.(t)cshrc or .bash_profile is executed. All of these files reside
in the user's home directory; there is also a system default login
and profile script (note the missing &ldquo;.&rdquo;s) stored in the /etc
directory.</p><p>When a new user is set up at our site, we give her a default
set of .login and .cshrc (the csh variants are the standard shells,
but the same could also be done for bash) plus some other files.
The only thing that needs to be adjusted is the setting for the
default printer in .cshrc:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv PRINTER
</pre><p><a href="3528l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
</p><p>An example default .login script is shown in Listing 1.
First, the script figures out the primary group (inside the
backticks) and loads the variable <b  >$SETUP</b> with
the path to that group's setup files, e.g.,
/usr/local/etc/dotfiles/finance if the user's primary group is
finance. Then, a number of so-called setup files are sourced
(included) into the currently running script and the commands in
them executed. In the case of the setup.OPENWIN script, it might
look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv OPENWINHOME /usr/openwin
setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/openwin/man
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/openwin/lib
</pre><p>These scripts ensure each user gets the same environment
settings for her particular group. Finally, the windowing system
(in this case, OpenWindows, Sun's version of X) is started. The
startup.OPENWIN will not return until the user explicitly logs out
of the GUI, at which time execution of this .login resumes. It
proceeds to delete some files the user may have left behind and
logs the user out of the system.
</p><p>Again, the beauty of this concept is in its simplicity. If we
install a new web browser, we need to change only the central setup
file to point to the newly installed version. Upon the next login,
each user receives the required settings to start it
successfully.</p><p>The same concept is also employed for the arrangement of each
user's GUI environment. The OpenLook Window Manager, OLWM, as well
as most other window managers, comes with an application menu which
can be customized to include whichever applications a user might
like to access easily. The menu description is stored in a file
named ~/.openwin-menu. Again, rather than having everyone create or
modify their own menus, this file is merely a link to the central
one stored in $SETUP/.openwin-menu. In it, a reference to a private
menu stored in $HOME/.openwin-private gives each user an easy
chance to add personal items. The central menu files are always
carefully maintained to make sure each application works as
advertised and are updated each time a new application is brought
on-line. Support personnel are grateful they can maneuver a user
through the menu by phone while looking at the exact same version
of the menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc9580.0x1db9de0"></a>Slipping into the Establishment</h2></div></div><p><a href="3528l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Integrating a Linux machine into this organization requires
the basic setup scripts to differentiate between operating systems
if paths are not the same or if some features are not available
across operating systems. Since OpenWindows is a proprietary Sun
package, a way has to be found for a user to get her OW setup when
logging into a Sun box and getting a reasonably similar X11 setup
on a Linux box. Wanting the least impact on existing scripts, one
good way is to insert the passage shown in Listing 2 into the
user's .login. This example first sources all setups that are
common across all platforms, like the default HTTP proxy settings,
possibly the <b  >NNTPSERVER</b> variable used by
newsreaders and others. Then, a switch statement treats each
supported operating system independently. In this case,
setup.WORDPROC is executed only for SunOS because we have no word
processor for Linux. The setup.WEBBROWSER script is also called
from the $SETUP directory, because it can differentiate between
operating systems. This makes sense if you use the same
applications across all platforms, e.g.,
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> and Netscape. The OpenWindows
and X11 scripts are platform specific.</p><p>Adding support for other systems would be easy to implement
in the same way. The &ldquo;default&rdquo; statement catches unsupported
systems and leaves the user at a shell prompt. Quitting this shell,
as well as quitting the GUI in the other cases, will continue
.login execution and conveniently log the user out.</p><p>Having made our way through the setup scripts, the last
obstacle to tackle is the GUI environment. Both X11 and OpenWindows
make use of the user's .xinitrc script. Luckily, this is just
another shell script and can be treated the same way as .login: add
a switch statement to distinguish between operating systems.
Generally, this shouldn't be necessary if you take care in setting
up the paths correctly and calling whatever X clients are started
in .xinitrc <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> full paths. So, rather
than having:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/panel
/usr/X11R6/bin/xload
/usr/local/bin/wmaker
</pre><p>to start two clients and the window manager, it is much more
convenient to write:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -x panel ]; then
        panel &amp;
fi
xload
wmaker
</pre>


This assumes that both <span   class="bold"><b>xload</b></span> and
WindowMaker are locatable through <b  >$PATH</b>. The
Gnome panel application may or may not be present and will be
executed only if found.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc9580.0x1dba308"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Introducing a renegade operating system like Linux into the
holy grail of a major company's production network takes a lot of
enthusiasm, persuasion and lobbying in addition to a fine feeling
for nestling it in as smoothly and unobtrusively as possible. If
people take notice without being pointed toward the change,
something went wrong.</p><p>Without sacrificing any of its inherent flexibility, Linux
fits the bill almost perfectly. I always take special pride in
demonstrating what Linux can do whenever one of its commercial
brethren fails to accomplish something satisfactorily, whether it
is related to performance issues, the speed and flexibility of
open-source software, or the speed with which the operating system
develops. This benefits the whole company and has led to Tux being
a well-liked companion on many a desk in addition to the server
rooms. This is a testament to the superiority of this OS and should
definitely help Linus toward his ultimate goal after all.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
