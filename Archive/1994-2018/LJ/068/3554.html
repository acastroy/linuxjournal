    This article discusses a few of the many procedures we must
    take after the install is done, so that the system will not
    be trivial to hack.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x1015558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Installing a Linux system is a relatively
easy task. Most of the distributions provide automatic installation
tools; these tools take care of the installation procedure from
beginning to end. The problem with these automatic installation
tools is that they tend to make the wrong assumptions about your
system. When it comes to security considerations, these wrong
assumptions can cause problems.
</p><p>Securing Linux is not an easy task. You never know who is
trying to gather information from your servers or even from your
desktop. Some people do not even try to gather information; they
just love it when they bring your web server down or have it show
their latest work of art.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x10156b8"></a>The Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The first thing to do after installation is remove unneeded
kernel features and services. The Linux kernel has many nice
networking features; some of these features are needed by our
system, some are not. Here are some kernel networking features we
should compile into our kernel: IP-firewalling, Tcp Syn Cookies,
Drop Source routed frames. The IP-firewalling option enables the
setup of IP access lists from the command line. The Tcp Syn Cookies
helps to prevent the known SYN flooding denial-of-service attack.
Source-routed frames allow an attacker to bypass the normal routing
decisions by specifying the routers the packet should go through
within the packet data: this is a very bad idea but is sometimes
needed. When compiling the kernel we need to go over all the
options and enable only the options needed by our system. If a
kernel option is needed we can compile it as a part of the kernel,
or we can compile the kernel to support this option as a module.
New kernels have new features; when compiling a new kernel we must
make sure we know what each and every option we have enabled
does.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x10157c0"></a>Disabling Processes</h2></div></div><p><a href="3554l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>We can view what processes run in our system by typing
<b  >ps aux</b>. The network sockets that are open in our
system, can be displayed by typing <b  >netstat -an</b>.
Listing 1 shows some of the open sockets on a Linux machine.</p><p>The fewer services our system gives, the better. The
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> process listens on the
TCP/UDP sockets specified by its configuration file. The
configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf by default, tells inetd what
sockets it should open and what processes it should execute once a
connection is made on the socket. We should go through all services
in the /etc/inetd.conf and disable those that we don't need on our
system. The best way to disable a service is to put a comment sign
<b  >#</b> at the beginning of the line that configures
the service we want to disable. It is a good idea to comment all
/etc/inetd.conf services and use secure services instead. As an
example, we can disable TELNET and FTP and enable
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> and FTP through ssh.</p><p>If we must enable a service, we should configure the service
in the most secure way it can be provided. The Linux system has
many tools to help an administrator provide services
securely.</p><p>One of these tools is the IP-Firewalling that the kernel
supports. Another tool is the
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span>, a program that monitors
requests for services on the system. It logs and checks the
request, and if all the checks show the client can receive the
service, it will open the right service for the client. There are
two files that tcpd consults when it checks for authorization:
/etc/host.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. To enable tcpd checks before a
service begins, we simply tell inetd to run tcpd in the
configuration file. Most Linux distributions are configured to run
inetd with tcpd for most services by default. Here is a line from
an inetd.conf that enables the tcpd checks whenever a TELNET
connection request from a client arrives:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root\
/usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
</pre><p>Whenever a telnet connection request arrives, tcpd is
activated by inetd. <span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span> logs the
connection request via the <span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span>
service, then consults the hosts.allow file. If the hosts.allow
file contains a match of <span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span>
and the requesting client, the telnet connection is considered
authorized and the connection is established. If there is no such
line, the /etc/hosts.deny file is consulted. There must be a line
specifing telnetd and client <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> in the
/etc/hosts.deny files if we don't want client
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> to be answered by our system.
</p><p>There are more complicated options available in the tcpd
configuration files, such as running shell commands after a certain
connection request occurs. For further information on the format of
the files, look at Section 5 of the manual for hosts_access and
hosts_options.</p><p>Another way to disable services run via inetd is to run a
shell script instead of the process. Let's have a look at a simple
shell script. Please note that it is not always safe to use this
method</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat &gt; /usr/sbin/telnetd.new
#!/bin/sh
echo "Please do not use telnet to this computer.\
Use ssh only if you have the correct public key"
$ chmod +x /usr/sbin/telnetd.new
</pre><p>We then edit the /etc/inetd.conf file so it will execute our
new script instead of in.telnetd. The line should look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpda\
   telnet.new
</pre>


Send <b  >HUP</b> signal to inetd , so it will read the
new configuration:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP 'ps -aux | grep inetd |
awk '{print $2}' '
</pre>


Test the new configuration:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet localhost
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Please do not use telnet to this computer. Use ssh only
if you have the correct public key.
</pre>


We must remember that each of the processes run through inetd has
its own configuration file. In these configuration files there are
security settings that can be activated. We can set up these
security settings so the services will get extra security. Take
FTP, for example; we can use tcpd to check FTP requests, but as an
extra security we can use the ftpaccess file to disable ftp access
for root just in case. If our machine has more than one Network
Interface Card, we may want to use daemons that enable us to
specify on which NIC they should open a socket. This type of
setting can't be done with inetd in a trivial way. Some of the FTP
daemons enable these settings via the configuration file. There is
another method to force a network daemon to listen only on a
certain interface. Suppose our machine is connected to network A
and network B, and it has two IP addresses: IA and IB. We want
telnetd to listen only on IPA, so we write a simple program that
opens port 23 on the IPB interface and make this program run just
before telnetd. After telnetd is up and running, we can kill our
little program. This won't work with every possible daemon, since
certain daemons fail to start unless they can open the socket on
each and every NIC on the system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x10161b8"></a>Networking Applications</h2></div></div><p>Some other networking programs do not run through inetd.
These are mostly daemons that run through the rc files at system
startup. When not needed, these daemons can be disabled by editing
the system startup files. The mount daemon, for example, is the
daemon that enables people to mount file systems from our Linux
machine. If we want to disable the mount daemon completely, we
should edit the rc files so the daemon will not run after the
system reboots. If we want to let selected clients in our network
work with parts of our file systems, we can run
<span   class="bold"><b>mountd</b></span> with a restricted set of
rules that will enforce our policy on the client. This will give
the client a limited access to our system.</p><p>To configure the mountd restrictions, we should edit the
/etc/exports file. The /etc/exports file is the file the mount
daemon consults before it gives permissions to the client to mount
our local file system. Not only can we limit the clients that can
mount our local file systems, but we can also enforce options such
as read-only, nosuid and more on the authorized clients.</p><p>Another often used program that listens for connections on
the network is the <span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span>. The
line-printer daemon opens port 515 to listen for connections. We
can edit the /etc/hosts.equiv or the /etc/hosts.lpd files to
disable and enable the service for some clients. With the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>port#</em></span> argument, we can tell lpd to listen on a
different port than 515; this is a good trick as long as it is not
the only step we are taking to secure the service.</p><p>The X Window System is a network-based window system that
enables other clients to send their application's display to our
server. These applications can be dangerous since they can read our
keystrokes and view the display of other applications on our X
server. If we don't need the X networking support, we can run the X
server with the option <b  >-nolisten tcp</b> set. This
option causes the X server to not listen to port 6000, and thus not
accept connections from any client. To use this option, simply add
it to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>clientargs</em></span> variable in the
/usr/X11/bin/startx script.</p><p>If we need to display output from other machines on our X
server, we can use the <span   class="bold"><b>xhosts</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xauth</b></span> commands to limit the
machines and users that can run applications on our X server. The
xhost command is very simple: <b  >xhost +
<i><tt>hostname</tt></i></b> or <b  >xhost -
<i><tt>hostname</tt></i></b>.</p><p>The <b  >+</b> sign indicates the client has
permission to run applications on our X server, using the
<b  >-display server:0.0</b> option from the command line
on the client machine. The <b  >-</b> sign indicates the
client does not have permission to run applications on our server,
and if a user on the client machine tries to run an X application
on our server, he will get an error message indicating he is not
authorized to do so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x1016948"></a>Internet Servers</h2></div></div><p>DNS servers must be secured. There is a huge amount of
information people can get easily, just by transferring our zone
file to their systems. Sometimes our zone files contain the inner
network addresses of our systems, router addresses and more.</p><p>BIND-8 has many neat security features. The latest version of
BIND 8 is 8.2.1, and I recommend upgrading name servers to this
version. It contains support of access lists (ACL) for zone query
and zone transfers. In the BIND configuration file we can limit the
machines that can transfer to each and every zone. One more thing
we can do is to put our local network zone, if any, in a secure
mode, so that <span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> will only
answer queries of names belonging to that zone to clients in our
local network. There are built-in ACL names such as
<b  >any</b> and <b  >none</b> which we can use
in the named configuration file. One big advantage of the new bind
versions is the logging. With version 8 we can tweak the logs to
show anything we would like to see. And when it comes to security,
the log is a very important issue. Listing 1 is an example of a
configuration file allowing only local hosts from network
192.168.1/24 to query all zones; it also allows queries from
anywhere on the network to query the outside zones only. One more
thing to look at in this named configuration file is that zone
transfers are only allowed to two other machines on the network and
only for the outside zone.</p><p><a href="3554l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>We can play with these new features of named and disable
&ldquo;dns relaying&rdquo; by allowing the world to query only zones for
which our name server is authoritative, and enabling other queries
only from our local networks. This kind of setting will disable the
possibility that someone from the Internet will send recursive
requests to our server.</p><p>Another nice feature in the BIND 8 is that the named can run
in a <span   class="bold"><b>chrooted</b></span> environment; this
means that if a hacker exploits the named, it will not have access
to all of the file system, but to a very small part of it. To make
named run in a chrooted environment, we can use the
<b  >-t</b> option from the command line.</p><p>The last thing about the DNS is we can make the name daemon
run as a non-root user. This is a very good thing to do as in many
other programs as in addition to named. By running a process as
root, we actually give the process the permission to do anything in
our system; we can accept that as long as the process does only
what it was programmed to do in the first place. However, if
someone can make this process run arbitrary code, for example, then
this arbitrary code will run as root. This means any bug or buffer
overflow found in this process can give the hacker a root
privilege. Since we don't want to make the hacker's life easier, we
can have the named run as a different user.</p><p>To accomplish this task, we first add the appropriate user
and group to the system. Than we use the <b  >-u</b> and
<b  >-g</b> options from the command line, to specify
<span   class="emphasis"><em>userid</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>groupid</em></span> to the
named process. [More discussion of &ldquo;Securing Name Servers on
UNIX&rdquo; can be found in the article of that name in this
issue.]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x100d860"></a>POP, IMAP and Others</h2></div></div><p>The problem with POP, IMAP and some other well-known
protocols, such as TELNET and FTP, is the user name and password
are sent from the client to the server in clear text. This means
someone can tap the communication between the server and the client
and get user names and passwords. It is also possible to make a
brute force attack on the server trying to guess user names and
passwords. We can take care of brute force attacks by running a
server that checks for such things. Some POP and IMAP servers close
the account after five bad passwords are entered; the account is
opened only after a waiting period or it may have to be opened
manually. There is an interesting solution to clear text passwords.
Some of the services support challenge-response passwords as well
as the trivial passwords.</p><p>For example, we can get a clear TELNET connection with the
SKEY package. The SKEY package gives the user a &ldquo;One Time
Password&rdquo;; even if someone taps the line and gets the password, he
can't use this password again to enter the server. Another tool is
<span   class="bold"><b>stunnel</b></span> which was reviewed by
David Bandel in the July 1999 <i  >LJ</i>.
<span   class="bold"><b>stunnel</b></span> gives the ability to
connect from client to server in a secure encrypted way for several
purposes, such as SMTP, POP and more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x100dac8"></a>Sendmail</h2></div></div><p>One could fill a book writing about sendmail security. I
would like to mention only a few of many more things about
sendmail. The first thing is there are alternatives out there that
claim to be much more secure then sendmail. It might be worthwhile
to test one of these applications. One more thing about sendmail is
that with a very simple program a hacker can try to get many user
names from our system by using the VRFY protocol command. The VRFY
and the EXPN protocol commands should be disabled in the
/etc/sendmail.cf file. To disable these commands, we should use the
following line in the sendmail.cf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
O PrivacyOptions=authwarnings\
noexpn novrfy
</pre><p>This option will prevent sendmail from answering to VRFY and
EXPN commands. It will also cause sendmail to complain about weak
security settings. One last thing I like to do with sendmail is to
remove the version number from its <b  >HELO</b> string,
so the version number will not be known to the outside.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1d580.0x100dcd8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Much work needs to be done when it comes to security. We
should check every day to see what new hacks have appeared and
which software should be upgraded for security reasons. When
installing a new application, we should always look at the security
settings and set them as tight as possible. It will not make our
system 100% cracker proof, but it will make it much harder for the
cracker to get into our system.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Eddie Harari can be reached via e-mail at
