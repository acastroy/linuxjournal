The Net as we know it today first became visible to me in March 1994, when
I was among several hundred other tech types gathered at Esther Dyson's PC
Forum conference in Arizona. On stage was John Gage
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gage" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gage</a>) of Sun Microsystems,
projecting a Mosaic Web browser
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)</a>) from a flaky Macintosh
Duo (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_Duo" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_Duo</a>), identical to
the one on my lap. His access was to Sun over dial-up.
</p><p>
Everybody in the audience knew about the Net, and some of us had been on it
one way or another, but few of us had seen it in the fullness John
demonstrated there. (At that date, there were a sum total of just three
Internet Service Providers.) James Fallows
(<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/james-fallows" target="_self">www.theatlantic.com/james-fallows</a>) was in the crowd,
and he described
it this way
(<a href="http://listserv.aera.net/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9406&amp;L=aera-f&amp;D=0&amp;P=351" target="_self">listserv.aera.net/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9406&amp;L=aera-f&amp;D=0&amp;P=351</a>) for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Atlantic</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In the past year millions of people have heard about the Internet, but few
people outside academia or the computer industry have had a clear idea of
what it is or how it works. The Internet is, in effect, a way of combining
computers all over the world into one big computer, which you seemingly
control from your desk. When connected to the Internet, you can boldly
prowl through computers in Singapore, Buenos Aires, and Seattle as if their
contents resided on your own machine.
</p><p>
In the most riveting presentation of the conference, John Gage, of Sun
Microsystems, demonstrated the World Wide Web, the gee-whizziest portion of
the Internet, in which electronic files contain not only text but also
graphics and sound and video clips. Using Mosaic, a free piece of
&ldquo;navigator&rdquo; software that made moving around the Web possible, Gage clicked
on icons on his screen exactly as if he were choosing programs or
directories on his own hard disk. He quickly connected to a Norwegian
computer center that had been collecting results during the Winter Olympics
in Lillehammer and checked out a score, duplicating what Internet users had
done by the millions every day during the games, when CBS-TV was
notoriously late and America-centric in reporting results.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Note the terms here. John used Mosaic to &ldquo;control&rdquo;,
&ldquo;boldly prowl&rdquo; and
&ldquo;navigate&rdquo; his way around the Web, which was
the &ldquo;gee-whizziest portion&rdquo; of the
Net.
</p><p>
That portion has since become conflated with the whole thing. Today we use
browsers to do far more than navigate the Web. Protocols that once required
separate apps&mdash;file transfer, e-mail, instant messaging&mdash;are now
handled by browsers as well. We now also can use browsers to watch
television, listen to radio and read publications. It's hard to name anything
a computer can do that isn't also doable (and done) in a browser. Serving
up most of those capabilities are utility Web services, provided by Amazon,
Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Google, Yahoo and many more, each with their own
clouds. The growth of the Web, atop the Net, also has provided a conceptual
bridge from computers to smartphones and tablets. Today nearly every mobile
app would be useless without a back-end cloud.
</p><p>
While relying on the Web and its clouds has increased the range of things
we can do on the Net, our freedom to act independently has
declined. The
browser that started out as a car on the &ldquo;information
superhighway&rdquo; has
become a shopping cart that gets re-skinned with every commercial site it
visits, carrying away tracking beacons that report our activities back to
centralized servers over which we have little if any control. The wizards
among us might be adept at maintaining some degree of liberty from
surveillance, but most muggles are either clueless about the risks or make
do with advertising and tracking blockers. This is less easy in the mobile
world, where apps are more rented than owned, and most are maintained by
vendor-side services.
</p><p>
Thus, we've traded our freedom for the conveniences of centralization. The
cure for that is decentralization: making the Net personal, like it
promised to be in the first place&mdash;and still is, deep down.
</p><p>
It should help to remember that the Web is <span   class="emphasis"><em>polycentric</em></span> while the Net is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>decentralized</em></span>. By polycentric, I mean server-based: every server is a
center. So, even though Tim Berners-Lee wanted the Web to be what he called
&ldquo;a distributed hypertext system&rdquo; for &ldquo;universal linked
information&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html" target="_self">www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html</a>), what
he designed was servers &ldquo;generating a hypertext
representation&rdquo;, as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11606f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Servers Generating a Hypertext Representation
</p></div></div><p>
Today this looks like your e-mail on a Google server&mdash;or your photos on
Instagram or your tweets on Twitter. There's nothing wrong with any of
those, just
something missing: your independence and autonomy.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the Net beneath the Web remains decentralized: a World of Ends
(<a href="http://worldofends.com" target="_self">worldofends.com</a>) in
which every end is a functional distance of zero from every other end.
&ldquo;The
end-to-end principle is the core architectural guideline of the
Internet&rdquo;
says RFC 3724. Thus, even though the Internet is a &ldquo;collection of
networks&rdquo;, what collects them are the transcendent purposes of the Net's
ends, which consist of you, me, Google and every other node.
</p><p>
If you want to grok the problems of centralization fully, and their threat
to personal freedom, to innovation and to much else, watch, listen to or
read Eben Moglen's lectures titled &ldquo;Snowden and the Future&rdquo;
(<a href="http://snowdenandthefuture.info" target="_self">snowdenandthefuture.info</a>), given in
November and December 2013 at Columbia University, where Eben has been teaching
law for 26 years. The lectures are biblical in tone and carry great
moral weight. For us in the Linux community, they are now in the canon.
</p><p>
What Eben calls for is not merely to suffer the problems of centralization,
but to solve them. This requires separating the Net and the Web. For me, it
helps to think of the Net as the ground we walk and drive on, and the Web
as clouds in the sky, as I've illustrated with the photo in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11606f2.large.jpg"><img src="11606f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. It helps to think of the Net as the ground we walk and drive on,
and the Web as clouds in the sky.
</p></div></div><p>
There are many possibilities for decentralized solutions on the Net's
ground, and I hope readers will remind us of some. Meanwhile, I'll volunteer
a pair I've been watching lately. One is TeleHash, and the other is XDI.
</p><p>
TeleHash (<a href="http://telehash.org" target="_self">telehash.org</a>) is the brainchild of Jeremie Miller, father of Jabber and the XMPP
protocol for instant messaging. Its slogan is &ldquo;JSON + UDP + DHT =
Freedom&rdquo;,
and it is described as &ldquo;a new wire protocol enabling applications to
connect privately in a real-time and fully distributed manner, freeing them
from relying on centralized data centers&rdquo;. The rest of the index page says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>What</b></span>
</p><p>
It works by sending and receiving small encrypted bits of JSON (with
optional binary payloads) via UDP
using an efficient routing system based
on Kademlia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia</a>), a proven and popular
Distributed Hash Table.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Demo</b></span>
</p><p>
It's very much in the R&amp;D stages yet, but check out hash-im
(<a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/hash-im" target="_self">https://github.com/quartzjer/hash-im</a>) for a simple
demo.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Status</b></span>
</p><p>
The current spec
(<a href="https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/protocol.md" target="_self">https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/protocol.md</a>) is implemented in a few languages (any help here would be
great!), and prototype apps are being created to test it. Questions can be
directed at Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremie" target="_self">https://twitter.com/jeremie</a>), or to Jeremie Miller
directly.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
XDI (<a href="http://xdi.org" target="_self">xdi.org</a>) is a mostly-baked standard. Its purpose
is &ldquo;to define a generalized,
extensible service for sharing, linking, and synchronizing data over
digital networks using structured data formats (such as JSON and XML) and
XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a URI-compatible abstract identifier
scheme defined by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xdi" target="_self">https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xdi</a>). Wikipedia (at the
moment) says (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The main features of XDI are: the ability to link and nest RDF graphs to
provide context; full addressability of all nodes in the graph at any level
of context; representation of XDI operations as graph statements so
authorization can be built into the graph (a feature called XDI link
contracts); standard serialization formats including JSON and XML; and a
simple ontology language for defining shared semantics using XDI dictionary
services.
</p><p>
XDI graphs can be serialized in a number of formats, including XML and
JSON. Since XDI documents are already fully structured, XML adds very
little value, so JSON is the preferred serialization format. The XDI
protocol can be bound to multiple transport protocols. The XDI TC is
defining bindings to HTTP and HTTPS, however it is also exploring bindings
to XMPP and potentially directly to TCP/IP.
</p><p>
XDI provides a standardized portable authorization format called XDI link
contracts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_contract" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_contract</a>). Link contracts are themselves XDI documents (which may be
contained in other XDI documents) that enable control over the authority,
security, privacy, and rights of shared data to be expressed in a standard
machine-readable format and understood by any XDI endpoint.
</p><p>
This approach to a globally distributed data sharing network models the
real-world mechanism of social contracts
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract</a>), and legal contracts that bind
civilized people and organizations in the real world today. Thus, XDI can be
a key enabler of the Social Web (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Web" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Web</a>). It has also been cited as a mechanism to
support a new legal concept, Virtual Rights (<a href="http://www.virtualrights.org" target="_self">www.virtualrights.org</a>), which are based on a new legal
entity, the &ldquo;virtual identity&rdquo;, and a new fundamental right:
&ldquo;to have or
not to have a virtual identity&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It's early for both of these. But I know in both cases the mentality of the
developers is on the ground of the Net and not lost in the clouds of the
Web. We'll need a lot more of that before we all get our freedom back.
