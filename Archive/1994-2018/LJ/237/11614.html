Encryption is powerful and scary. Let's remove the scary.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1722580.0x181a358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The truth is, I really don't have anything on my hard drive that I would
be upset over someone seeing. I have some cat photos. I have a few text
files with ideas for future books and/or short stories, and a couple
half-written starts to NaNoWriMo novels. It would be easy to say that
there's no point encrypting my hard drive, because I have nothing to
hide. The problem is, we wrongly correlate a &ldquo;desire for
privacy&rdquo; with
&ldquo;having something to hide&rdquo;. I think where I live, in America, we've taken
our rights to privacy for granted. Rather than the traditional &ldquo;he must
be hiding porn or bombs&rdquo;, think about something a little more
mundane.
</p><p>
I live in Michigan. It's cold here in the winter, and I tend to keep my
thermostat set around 75 degrees. That might seem high to you, but for my
family, it's just right. Thanks to the privacy of my own home, my neighbors
don't know how toasty warm we keep it. Some of those neighbors would be
very upset to see how &ldquo;wasteful&rdquo; the Powers family is in the winter. In
fact, there's one local man who makes it a point to let everyone know
that anything over 60 degrees is ecologically wasteful. I don't want to get
into a fight with Old Man Icebritches, so we just keep our comfortable
house a secret. We don't have anything to hide, but it's not something
everyone needs to know about.
</p><p>
Obviously my example is silly, but hopefully it makes you think. Modern
Linux allows us to encrypt our data easily and reliably, so why not take
advantage of it?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1722580.0x181a778"></a>
How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>
I won't go into too much detail about how encryption works, but a basic
understanding is necessary for even the simplest implementation. To
encrypt and decrypt a file, two &ldquo;keys&rdquo; are required. One is the
private key, which is just that, private. I like to think of the private
key as an actual key&mdash;you can make copies if you want, but it's not
wise to do so. The more copies of your private keys you make, the more
likely someone nefarious will get one and break into your apartment&mdash;er,
I mean files.
</p><p>
The public key is more like a schematic for a lock that only you can open
(with your private key). You make this key available for anyone. You
can post it on a Web site, put it in your e-mail, tattoo it on your back,
whatever. When others want to create a file that only you can see,
they encrypt it using your public key.
</p><p>
This one-to-many scenario also has a cool side effect. If you encrypt
something using your private key, anyone can decrypt it using your
public key. This may sound silly, but what makes such a scenario useful
is that although the encrypted file isn't protected from prying eyes, it is
guaranteed to be from you. Only a file encrypted with your private key
can be decrypted with your public key. In this way, encrypting something
with your private key digitally &ldquo;signs&rdquo; the file.
</p><p>
Usually it works like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
You have a file you want to send to Suzy, so you encrypt it with
Suzy's public key. Only Suzy can open it, but there's no way for Suzy
to know that you are the one who sent it, since anyone could encrypt a
file with her public key.
</p></li><li><p>
Therefore, you take the file you encrypted with Suzy's public key
and encrypt <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> file with <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> private key. Suzy will have to decrypt
the file twice, but she'll know it came from you.
</p></li><li><p>
Suzy receives the file and decrypts the first layer with your public
key, proving it came from you.
</p></li><li><p>
Suzy then decrypts the second layer of encryption with her private key,
as that's the only key able to decrypt the original file. (Because
you originally encrypted it with her public key.)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
That scenario is when encryption is used for safely transferring
files, of course. It's also quite common simply to encrypt your files
(or partitions) so that no one can see them unless you decrypt them
first. Let's start with file encryption, because that's what most people
will want to do on their systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1722580.0x181ae58"></a>
Starting Simple</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into more complex type setting, let's discuss simply
encrypting a file. There are various programs to handle encryption.
In fact, it's easy to get overwhelmed with the available options for
file and system encryption. Today, let's use a basic (but very powerful)
command-line tool for encrypting a file. GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) is an
open-source implementation of PGP (Pretty Good Protection). It allows
encryption and signing, and manages multiple keys and so on. For this
example, let's simply encrypt a file.
</p><p>
Let's say you have a file called secret_manifesto.txt, which contains the
secrets to life, the universe and everything. Using GPG, you can encrypt
the file with a passphrase. Using a passphrase is far simpler than using
a public and private key pair, because it's simply encrypted using your
passphrase. This does make your file more susceptible to cracking (using
rainbow tables or other hacking tools), but like the label on the tin
says, it's Pretty Good Protection. To encrypt your file, you can do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# gpg -c secret_manifesto.txt
# Enter passphrase:
# Repeat passphrase:
</pre>
</p><p>
Once complete, you'll have a new file in the same directory. 
It will be named secret_manifesto.txt.gpg by default. This is a binary file, which
means it's fairly small, but it can't be copy/pasted into an e-mail
or IM. For portability, you can add the -a flag, which will create an
encrypted file that contains only ASCII text:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# gpg -a -c secret_manifesto.txt
# Enter passphrase:
# Repeat passphrase:
# ls -l
-rw-rw-r--  1 spowers spowers    6 Nov 23 1:26 secret_manifesto.txt
-rw-rw-r--  1 spowers spowers  174 Nov 23 1:27 secret_manifesto.txt.asc
-rw-rw-r--  1 spowers spowers   55 Nov 23 1:26 secret_manifesto.txt.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice there is now a file with .asc as the extension. This is text-only,
but you can see in the code snippet that it's also much larger than
the binary encrypted file, and much much larger than the original text
file. Once you've encrypted your file, if you truly want to keep your
information secret, it would be wise to delete the original text file.
</p><p>
To decrypt the file, you'll again use the gpg program. The same command
will decrypt either file, whether it's binary or ASCII:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# gpg secret_manifesto.txt.asc
# gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
# Enter passphrase:
# gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
# File `secret_manifesto.txt' exists. Overwrite? (y/N)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice in the example above, I hadn't deleted the original text file,
so gpg gave me the option of overwriting. Once complete, I have my
original file back, unencrypted. If you just have a file or two you
want to protect, the command-line gpg program might be all you need. If
you'd rather have an area on your system that automatically encrypts
everything you save, it's a little more complicated. It's still not
terribly difficult, but let's start with a fairly simplistic model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1722580.0x181b278"></a>
Encrypting a USB Drive</h2></div></div><p>
Like I mentioned earlier, there are many options when it comes to
encryption. One of the more popular methods of encrypting partitions
is the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) system. A USB drive with a
LUKS-formatted partition should be detected automatically by most systems. In
fact, if you're using a desktop environment like Ubuntu Desktop,
encrypting a USB drive is a simple check box during the formatting process.
Although that's a perfectly acceptable way to encrypt your USB drive,
I'm going to demonstrate how to do it on the command line, so you
understand what's actually happening behind the scenes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Step 1: identify your USB drive.</b></span>
</p><p>
If you type <tt  >dmesg</tt> after plugging in your USB drive, you should get all
sorts of system information, including the device name of your freshly
plugged-in USB device. Make sure you have the correct device identified,
because what you're doing will destroy any data on the drive. You wouldn't
want to format the wrong disk accidentally. (It should go without saying,
but I'll say it anyway, make sure there's nothing on your USB drive that
you want to save&mdash;this is a destructive process.)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Step 2: partition the USB drive.</b></span>
</p><p>
Assuming that your USB drive is the /dev/sdb device on your system, you
need to create a single partition on the drive. Let's use fdisk. Below
is the interaction with fdisk required. Basically, you create a new empty
partition with the <tt  >o</tt> command, then write changes
with <tt  >w</tt>. Then, you'll
restart fdisk and use the <tt  >n</tt> command to create a new primary partition,
using the defaults so that the entire drive is used:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

Command (m for help): o
Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x1234567.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

# sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
Command (m for help): n
Command action
e   extended
p   primary partition (1-4)
p
Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
Using default value 1
First sector (2048-1016522, default 2048):
Using default value 2048
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-1016522, default 1016522):
Using default value 1016522

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a USB drive with a single partition (/dev/sdb1), but there is
no filesystem on it. That's exactly what you want, because the LUKS system
creates an encryption layer on the partition <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
you put a filesystem on
it. So before creating a filesystem, let's create the LUKS layer on the
partition, using the cryptsetup program. If you don't have cryptsetup,
search for it in your distribution's repository; it should be there.
To create the LUKS encrypted partition layer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1

WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/sdb1 irrevocably.

Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
Enter LUKS passphrase:
Verify passphrase: 
</pre>
</p><p>
Follow the directions, and be sure to remember your passphrase! Note,
that a &ldquo;passphrase&rdquo; is usually more than just a word. It's most often
a phrase, thus the name. The longer the phrase, the tougher to crack.
</p><p>
Once the process completes, you have an encrypted partition, but it's
not mounted or formatted yet. The first step is to mount the partition,
which again uses the cryptsetup utility:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 my_crypto_disk
Enter passphrase for /dev/sdb1:
</pre>
</p><p>
When you type in your passphrase, the device name you entered
will be mounted like a virtual hard drive. Usually, it's mounted
under /dev/mapper/devicename, so this example mounts a partition at
/dev/mapper/my_crypto_disk.
</p><p>
This device is now being accessed as an unencrypted volume. As long as
it stays mounted, it will act like any other unencrypted volume. That
means you need to write a filesystem to it if you want to use it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkfs.vfat /dev/mapper/my_crypto_disk -n my_crypto_disk
mkfs.vfat 3.0.9 (31 Jan 2010)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the drive is fully functional and can be mounted like any other
disk. In fact, when you put the USB drive into your computer, if you
have a modern GUI desktop, it should prompt you for a password and
mount it automatically. Then you can eject it like a normal disk, and
it will be encrypted until you next enter your passphrase. It's simple
to unmount and, therefore, re-encrypt the drive on the command line too,
using cryptsetup:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup luksClose my_crypto_disk
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1722580.0x181bc70"></a>
That's Only the Tip of the Iceberg</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, my hope is to peel back some of the mystery behind
encryption. It's simple to encrypt and decrypt a file. It's not too
much more difficult (especially if you use the GUI desktop tools) to
encrypt an entire USB drive. With most distributions, it's possible to
encrypt the entire home directory during the installation process! When
encryption is set up on your entire home directory, however, there are
some issues you need to address. For example, jobs that run while you're
not logged in most likely will not have access to your home directory. If
you have cron jobs that need access to your home directory, you should
rewrite them to access data elsewhere on the system. I find a happy
medium between security and convenience is to encrypt a USB drive
and store my personal data on it.
</p><p>
Once you get the encryption bug, I must warn you, you'll want to start
encrypting everything. That's not a bad thing, but like the home directory
scenario, you'll run into a few snags. Cross-platform accessibility is
a big one if you go between systems. For situations like that, I highly
recommend TrueCrypt (<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org" target="_self">www.truecrypt.org</a>). I've mentioned TrueCrypt in
UpFront pieces before, but it's basically an open-source, cross-platform
encryption system that allows you to encrypt files, folders, partitions
and more while being able to access that data on any system. Windows, Mac
and Linux clients are all available, and the community has great support.
</p><p>
You don't have to have something to hide in order to desire encryption
for your files. Just like it's wise to lock your house at night, even
if you live in a good neighborhood, it's a smart move to encrypt your
personal data. If you want to share your photos of Mr Whiskerton in
his cute little beanie hat with everyone on the Internet, that's your
right. But others don't need to see those things if they're being nosey and
poking around your hard drive!
